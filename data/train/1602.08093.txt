    "spin is the fundamental electronic quantum degree of freedom in solid state materials . in superconductors ,",
    "cooper pairs , as composed of two spin-1/2 particles , can have spin-1 angular momentum , leading to spin - triplet pairings , in contrast to the usual spin - singlet pairing of opposite spins in the simplest @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "recently , it has been shown that majorana zero modes ( mzms ) , which may exist as stable localized zero energy mid - gap excitations in topological superconductor interfaces , can only have @xmath1-wave odd - frequency @xcite spin - triplet correlations @xcite at the boundary of topological superconductors ( tscs ) @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath1-wave spin - triplet pairing is insensitive to non - magnetic impurity scattering , spin - triplet pairs can be stabilized at the interface of a topological - superconductor / normal - metal ( tsc / nm ) hybrid system .",
    "consequently , mzms can assist the injection of pure stable spin - triplet cooper pairs into the normal - metal region of a tsc / nm / tsc junction .",
    "thus , a topological josephson junction ( jj ) is indeed a spin - triplet jj which makes it possible to utilize the majorana spin degree of freedom to detect and manipulate mzms , and demonstrate their non - abelian braiding statistics .    in this work",
    ", we theoretically study the spin dependent current - phase relation and mzm coupling energy of topological jjs .",
    "we show that the mzm - induced spin - triplet pairing states @xcite at the two ends of a realistic one - dimensional ( 1d ) tsc ( specifically , the nanowire - superconductor hybrid system of great current interest ) have an intrinsic @xmath0-phase difference . we demonstrate that this @xmath0-phase , originating from majorana enforced spin - triplet pairing , arises neither from a magnetic flux - induced phase , refereed to charge phase since magnetic flux",
    "is coupled to electrons charge degree of freedom , nor from the cooper pairs orbital ( e.g. @xmath2- or @xmath3-wave ) effect , and can produce a fractional josephson @xmath4-junction and @xmath0-junction , which exhibit a josephson phase of @xmath4 and @xmath0 in its ground state in the absence of any applied magnetic flux respectively , in the n - shape and u - shape nanowires [ fig .",
    "[ d - current - phase](a , b ) ] . from this result",
    ", we unambiguously establish the presence of a spin - state dependent phase , referred to as _ spin - phase _ , in spin - triplet pairings in this system .",
    "the spin - phase difference across the topological jj can be continuously tuned by spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the normal part ( black wire ) of the jj through a gate voltage [ fig .",
    "[ h - jj](a ) ] so as to turn on and off the mzm coupling energy for both time - reversal invariant and time - reversal broken topological jjs leading to experimentally - testable @xmath5 periodic josephson current - phase relations in both charge phase and spin - phase .",
    "in particular , the soc tunable spin - phase can drive the time - reversal symmetry broken jj to be a fractional josephson @xmath6-junction @xcite , which can exhibit a josephson phase of @xmath6 ( neither 0 nor @xmath0 ) and a finite josephson current in its ground state in the absence of any applied magnetic flux .",
    "the observation of this soc - induced josephson current would serve as a clear signal for topological superconductivity and mzms .",
    "in addition , we show that the direction of the fractional josephson current induced by the spin - phase is locked to the fermion parity of the topological jj .",
    "it is noted that the soc , driving non - trivial spin - phase - current relation , is inside the normal nanowire ( black wire in fig .",
    "[ h - jj](a ) ) , which is not coupled to a superconductor , and thus readily tuned by an applied gate with the well developed spintronic technique @xcite .",
    "we thus combine majorana physics and spintronics , and propose an all - electrically controlled superconductor - semiconductor hybrid circuit to manipulate and control mzms , and detect their non - abelian braiding statistics @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     _ experimental feasibility : _ we note here that the u - junction is the building block of our proposed braiding devices . since the single - crystaline insb nanowire networks @xcite has been fabricated and semiconductor nanowires with soc coupling , proximity - induced superconducting gap , and zeeman spin splitting have been realized experimentally @xcite , there should be no significant technical obstacle to realize the proposed devices in fig .",
    "[ braiding ] and fig .",
    "[ initial ] .",
    "for the braiding process , our proposal only needs to tune the spin - orbit coupling through the gate voltages inside the normal nanowire region ( black and green wires in fig .",
    "[ braiding ] and fig .",
    "[ initial ] rather than the region of majorana wires ( red wires ) in proximity to the superconductors .",
    "thus the proposed gate - control of spin - orbit coupling in our work can be achieved by standard technologies of the semiconductor spintronics @xcite .",
    "the measured josephson current , according to our calculation shown in fig .  [ cvm ] , is about @xmath7 with @xmath8 the proximity induced superconductors gap in the topological superconducting nanowires ( red wires in fig .",
    "[ braiding ] and fig .",
    "[ initial ] ) . by taking the proximity induced hard gap in inas as 0.2 mev @xcite ,",
    "the maximal soc current in our model is about 2na within the experimentally detectable regime .",
    "thus our proposal has the advantage of experimental feasibility .",
    "in conclusion , we have established the emergence of _ spin - phase _ for mfs and demonstrated that it can be tuned by soc in the normal region of the topological jj .",
    "we theoretically proposed several applications in majorana spintronics .",
    "this spin - phase has an important topological origin in the sense that it arises from an intrinsic majorana induced @xmath0-phase difference between opposite ends of a spinful one - dimensional tsc , which we have shown to exhibit crucial spin dependence .",
    "the spin - phase based majorana spin physics is not only conceptually novel , but also implies innovative applications in making robust gate voltage tunable fractional @xmath0- and @xmath9-junctions .",
    "we thus provide an all - electrically controlled semiconductor circuit to braid mzms and to read out the topological information encoded by their non - abelian statistical features without tuning any external magnetic flux , which opens the way to electrically controlled majorana spintronics studies .",

    "considering a cooper pair composed of two electrons , the wave function can be heuristically written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the coefficients of the corresponding spin states . however , eq .  ( [ spin1 - 1 ] ) is not convenient or precise in describing superconductors lacking spin rotation symmetry . to get a more general and concise description of the spin - triplet cooper pairs ,",

    "the corresponding anomalous part of the density matrix is @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "we find that the relative phase between the state @xmath32 and @xmath33 corresponds to the azimuthal angle of the @xmath28-vector in the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this state has no spin polarization although it is a spin - triplet state .",
    "this type of spin - triplet state is called unitary state @xcite . for any unitary spin - triplet state ,",
    "its @xmath28-vector is always real up to an overall u(1 ) phase  @xcite and therefore it satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "there is yet another type of spin - triple state whose pairing is restricted in one spin channel , and such states are fully spin polarized . for a state of this type , we can always choose a spin basis with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding anomalous density matrix reads @xmath39 and we have @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath28-vector of this state satisfies the condition @xmath41 .",
    "in this section , we consider the transformation of cooper pairs under the mirror operation @xmath42 .",
    "cooper pairs can be described by a block off - diagonal density matrix , @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 the amplitudes of @xmath1-wave spin - singlet cooper pairs and spin - triplet triplet ones with @xmath28-vector along @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath47 direction respectively . here",
    ", we assume that the spin - triplet pairs are induced by mzms and are thereby @xmath1-wave @xcite . the mirror operator @xmath42 in electron - hole and spin spaces is @xmath48 for a mirror ( @xmath42 ) symmetric system we have @xmath49 with @xmath50",
    "as the magnetic flux does not distinguish spin - up or spin - down , all of the four cooper pairs should have the same flux - induced charge phase .",
    "however according to eq .",
    ", only those spin - triplet pairs , with @xmath28-vector along the @xmath34 or @xmath35 direction , are opposite in sign at @xmath47 and @xmath51 . in other words",
    ", they have a @xmath0-phase difference . besides , the @xmath1-wave spin - singlet bulk superconducting gap in the semiconductor nanowire models ( eq .   and eq .  ) is uniform in the entire wire .",
    "we therefore conclude here that this @xmath0-phase difference for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 spin - triplet cooper pairs is not a charge phase but a spin - phase .",
    "we have demonstrated topological @xmath4 and @xmath0 jjs in the strong zeeman splitting limit of a 1d bdi class topological superconductor model in sec .",
    "[ 0-pi - sec ] .",

    "[ d - current - phase](a ) and [ d - current - phase](b ) is valid for any multi - channel d class topological superconductor model as long as it has mirror symmetry with mirror plane perpendicular to the wire direction .",
    "we first consider the 1d bdi class topological superconductor model beyond the strong zeeman splitting limit . the tight - binding model described by eq",
    ".   in the continuous limit takes the form @xmath54",
    "\\tau_z-\\delta \\sigma_y\\tau_y.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the realistic semiconductor nanowire , the chemical potential @xmath55 and the soc energy @xmath56 is much smaller than the superconducting gap @xmath8 and zeeman energy @xmath57 @xcite . in this case , the right mzm of eq .   is @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . to satisfy the boundary condition @xmath64",
    ", we have @xmath65 .    as @xmath66 decays much faster than @xmath67 or @xmath68 , by neglecting the term containing @xmath66 in eq .",
    ", the mzm wave function inside the tsc can be simplified as @xmath69 where its spin direction only depends on @xmath8 and @xmath57 with @xmath70 . here ,",
    "because soc energy is much smaller than the zeeman energy and superconducting gap , we also neglect the terms containing soc strength @xmath71 .",
    "as the system is invariant under the mirror operation @xmath42 , the left mzm @xmath72 takes the form @xmath73    for the topological jj in fig .",
    "[ d - current - phase](a ) , the hamiltonian in eq .   can be rewritten in the spin quantization basis of @xmath74 and @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 rotate the spin quantization axis of @xmath78 and @xmath72 to @xmath47 axis respectively and @xmath79    for the multi - channel semiconductor wire , there is an additional soc hopping term @xmath80 which breaks the complex symmetry but respects the mirror symmetry with the mirror plane perpendicular to the wire direction .",
    "thus the spin wave function of mzm @xmath78 and @xmath72 can be generally written as @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively with @xmath83 the azimuthal angle of @xmath78 spin polarization .",
    "correspondingly , the rotation operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 are generalized to @xmath86 with @xmath87 . by inserting the new spin wave functions and rotation operators into eq .",
    ", we find that the coupling hamiltonian form is not affected by the azimuthal angle @xmath83 and is thus valid for multi - channel d class tscs which are invariant under the mirror operation @xmath42 .",
    "it is noted that effective coupling hamiltonian ( eq .  ) is always a topological josephson 0-junction and @xmath88 is the inner product of the spin wave functions of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath91 , eq .",
    "returns to the mzm coupling hamiltonian for the strong zeeman splitting limit . for the topological jj in fig .",
    "[ d - current - phase](b ) , the two mzms @xmath92 and @xmath93 have the same spin polarization so that their coupling hamiltonian is always @xmath94 which corresponds to a topological josephson @xmath0-junction .",
