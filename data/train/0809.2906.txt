    "in order to grasp the fundamental difference between classical and quantum phase transitions , one can start with the basic principle of thermodynamics that systems in thermal equilibrium lie in their minimal free energy state . as a consequence ,",
    "a change in temperature can drive a classical phase transition by a competition between low energy configurations and the entropy associated to thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , strictly at zero temperature , most physical systems have quenched their entropy and some kind of order may be expected .",
    "even then , heisenberg s uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics implies that zero - point motion is always present . if the strength of these quantum fluctuations can be increased by changing some non - thermal parameter @xmath1 ( in analogy to an increase of temperature )",
    ", the ground state of the system may evolve between two wavefunctions with different symmetries , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by a quantum phase transition at a critical value @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "interestingly , even if absolute zero temperature is experimentally unaccessible , quantum phase transitions leave peculiar fingerprints that are visible at non zero temperature  @xcite .        quantum dots ( qds )",
    "seem then to be ideal devices to observe quantum phase transitions .",
    "first , such gate - tunable artificial atoms offer a high degree of control by simple gate electrostatics .",
    "second , due to the nanometric confinement of the electrons , they display relatively high energy scales that allow the obsvervation of interesting quantum phenomena at low temperature .",
    "finally , the coupling between the qd and the electronic reservoirs ( transport probes ) provides tunneling events that can fundamentally alter the dot states into complicated many - body wavefunctions .",
    "one well studied situation ( although not classified as a quantum transition ) where these three points fortuitously play together occurs when a single unpaired spin @xmath5 characterizes the ground state of the qd .",
    "when conducting electrons move to - and - from the device while reversing the tiny magnetic moment of the dot , a progressive screening of the atomic spin occurs , in complete analogy to the well - known kondo effect in solids containing magnetic impurities  @xcite . the kondo effect in qds",
    "is then observed as zero - bias conductance resonance  @xcite , associated to the entangled state of electrons in the leads and in the dot , and which displays a high degree of universality .",
    "qds with even occupancy introduce the possibility of having a singlet or a triplet spin state , if the coupling to the electrodes may be neglected . when the kondo effect sets in to meet the singlet - triplet splitting , a subtle competition occurs for the fate of the dot magnetic state , which was predicted to turn the singlet - triplet crossing into a true zero - temperature quantum phase transition , although different theoretical scenarios have been put forward , depending whether one  @xcite or two  @xcite screening channels are involved . while quantum critical phenomena related to kondo screening have been attributed to the astonishing properties of many strongly correlated materials  @xcite , a clear - cut observation in nanostructures of a screening - unscreening transition is still lacking .",
    "this is despite the intensive studies of singlet - triplet kondo effects measured through vertical quantum dots  @xcite , gaas lateral quantum dots under an applied magnetic field  @xcite , or at zero magnetic field  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite , and double dot structures  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ability to observe a sharp quantum transition is limited either by the existence of two screening electronic channels ( linked to conserved orbital quantum numbers ) , which generically give an avoided transition  @xcite , or by relatively low kondo temperatures , leading to the broad features observed in those experiments . @xmath0 qds inserted in a nanoscale constriction present several key ingredients for observing a quantum phase transition : i ) due to their tunneling geometry , a predominant single screening channel should be expected ( similarly to lateral qds ) ; ii ) previous investigations have demonstrated large kondo temperatures @xmath6  @xcite due to the small nanometer size of the qds molecule ; iii ) as demonstrated below , gate - tuning of the singlet - triplet gap at zero magnetic field can be obtained and allows the precise tuning of the system across the singlet - triplet boundary .",
    "this experiment constitutes an advance in the realization of many - body effects in quantum dots .",
    "these results are thus relevant for understanding bulk correlated materials and opens new possibilities for the precise control of spin states in nanostructures containing few electrons .",
    "we briefly discuss the sample preparation and measurement system . a more detailed description details on the measurement",
    "is given in the supplementary information .",
    "we emphasize that the experiment was carried out in a dilution refrigerator with a high degree of filtering , a technical development that was crucial for unveiling the complex quantum phenomena that takes place at low temperatures .",
    "preparation of the single @xmath0 transistor was realized by blow drying a dilute toluene solution of the @xmath0 molecule onto a gold nano - wire realized on an @xmath7 back gate , see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b for a schematic view of the setup . before blow drying the solution ,",
    "the electrodes were cleaned with acetone , ethanol , isopropanol solution and oxygen plasma .",
    "the connected sample is inserted in a copper shielded box , enclosed in a high frequency low temperature filter , consisting of thermocoax micro - wave filter and @xmath8 filters , anchored to the mixing chamber of the dilution fridge having a base temperature equals to @xmath9  mk .",
    "the nano - wire coated with molecules is then broken by electromigration  @xcite , via a voltage ramp at @xmath10  k. our electromigration technique uses real time electronics to monitor the coupling of the single molecule to the electrodes . here",
    "we report a full experimental study of transport measurements on a @xmath0 qd , as a function of bias voltage @xmath11 , gate voltage @xmath12 , temperature @xmath13  ( @xmath9  mk @xmath14 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15",
    "k ) , and magnetic field @xmath16 up to @xmath17  t.",
    "we start by discussing the general features of the @xmath18 qd , on the basis of a large scale two - dimensional map of the differential conductance @xmath19 as a function of both bias @xmath11 and gate @xmath12 voltages , obtained at @xmath9  mk and at zero magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "the distinct conducting and non - conducting regions are typical signatures of a single molecule transistor .",
    "we present measurements over two distinct coulomb diamonds indicated by `` odd '' and `` even '' on fig .",
    "[ fig1]c .    in region",
    "`` odd '' , we measure a sharp high - conductance ridge in the zero - bias @xmath19 , which is clearly associated to the usual @xmath5 kondo effect  @xcite .",
    "this conductance anomaly , connected to the complete quenching of the dot local moment by the conduction electrons , was already investigated at length for other quantum dot systems ( see  @xcite for a review ) , and we report for comparison in the supplementary information a detailled study of the conductance as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "henceforth we focus on the `` even '' coulomb diamond where an increase in gate voltage results in an additional electron on the dot and thus an even number of total electron .",
    "these two - electron states can be described by their total spin @xmath20 and spin projection @xmath21 and are noted @xmath22 .",
    "the ground state of the system can thus be either a spin singlet @xmath23 with energy @xmath24 , or a spin triplet with energy @xmath25 described by the three states @xmath26 , degenerated at zero magnetic field , but split by the zeeman effect , with an energy shift @xmath27 for each state @xmath28 , where @xmath29 for a @xmath0 molecule ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "[ fig1]d presents a precise low bias @xmath19 measurement of the `` even '' region inside the dotted rectangle of fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , which clearly displays two distinct regions , which we associate by anticipation to the singlet and triplet ground states respectively .",
    "the possibility of a gate - tuning of the singlet - triplet splitting @xmath30 was demonstrated previously both for lateral quantum dots  @xcite and carbon nanotube junctions  @xcite .",
    "the two levels cross at a critical gate voltage @xmath31  v.    in the `` singlet '' region , a finite - bias conductance anomaly appears when @xmath11 coincides with @xmath30 , and is explained by a non - equilibrium kondo effect involving excitations into the spin degenerate triplet .",
    "this effect was recently elucidated on a carbon nanotube quantum dot in the singlet state  @xcite . as shown in the supplementary information ,",
    "our results are consistent with this previous report .    increasing the gate voltage , and neglecting the electrode coupling which will be discussed in greater details below",
    ", the triplet becomes the ground state .",
    "two kinds of resonances are then observed : i ) a finite - bias @xmath32 anomaly , interpreted as a singlet - triplet non - equilibrium kondo effect on the triplet side , that disperses as @xmath33 in the ( @xmath12,@xmath34 plane ; ii ) a sharp zero - bias @xmath19 peak , related to the underscreened spin @xmath35 kondo effect  @xcite , as indicated by the low value of the conductance peak .    in order to precisely identify these spin states , and vindicate",
    "our later scaling analysis near the singlet - triplet crossing point , we now present a detailed magneto - transport investigation of the `` even '' region .",
    "due to the high @xmath29 factor of a @xmath0 molecule , as compared for instance to @xmath36 in gaas - based devices , it is easier to lift the degeneracy of the triplet state via the zeeman effect .",
    "figures [ fig2]b and [ fig2]d show the evolution of the different conductance anomalies in the `` even '' coulomb diamond , as a funtion of magnetic field .",
    "[ fig2]b shows @xmath19 as a function of the magnetic field up to @xmath17  t , for a constant gate voltage @xmath12 chosen in the `` singlet '' region ( albeit far from the transition point ) . in this case , a zeeman induced transition from the @xmath23 singlet to the lowest @xmath37 triplet occurs by increasing the magnetic field , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , and demonstrated by the clear level crossing in the conductance map .",
    "the splitting of the threefold triplet is also blatant , and the various spectroscopic lines are consistent with the spin selection rules at both low and high field , where @xmath23 and @xmath37 are the respective ground states .    fig .",
    "[ fig2]d investigates the gate - induced singlet - triplet crossing at a constant magnetic field of 3  t. on the singlet side , the zeeman splitted triplet states are clearly seen as three parallel lines , while the transition lines from the @xmath37 ground state at higher voltage are in agreement with the energy levels depicted in fig .",
    "note that due to lower contrast in the `` triplet '' region , we have plotted here for better visibility the second order derivative of the current @xmath38 .",
    "this gate and magnetic field study gives thus proof of a singlet to triplet transition inside the `` even '' diamond .",
    "one further remarkable aspect of our data is the absence of a large enhancement of the zero - bias conductance at the singlet - triplet crossing , both in zero - field ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) and in the zeeman effect ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "such features were on the contrary observed in previous experiments . in vertical semiconductor quantum dots",
    "@xcite , a field - induced orbital effect can be used to bring the non - degenerate triplet in coincidence with the low - lying singlet state , leading to a spectacular kondo enhancement of the conductance , which was shown to be associated to two screening channels  @xcite . in carbon nanotube junctions",
    "@xcite , the zeeman effect dominates over the orbital effect , so that the transition involves the lowest triplet state only , and kondo signatures arise from a single channel , which must be however well - balanced between the two orbital states of the quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "the lack of both types of singlet - triplet kondo effects points towards the predominent coupling between a single screening channel and one of the two spin states of the @xmath18 qd , in which case a kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transition should infact be expected at the singlet - triplet crossing  @xcite .",
    "having established the nature of the magnetic states far from the transition point , we focus now on the conductance for gate voltages @xmath12 close to the critical value @xmath39 where singlet and triplet states are brought together at zero magnetic field .    the transition region shown in the middle of fig .",
    "[ fig1]d is thus expanded in the conductance map of fig .",
    "[ fig3]b taken at the base temperature @xmath40  mk .",
    "we first notice that a sharp conductance dip forms on the singlet side of the transition , in contrast to the shallow minima observed in previous experiments for two - level quantum dots in the singlet regime  @xcite .",
    "now focusing on the triplet side , we note the presence of two different energy scales ( that we will relate to two kondo screening processes ) : i ) the zero bias peak shows a small and narrowing width , which we connect to a @xmath35 kondo temperature @xmath41 ; ii ) the satellites previously associated to a non - equilibrium singlet - triplet kondo effect far from the transition point now smoothly merge together to form a large resonance related to another larger kondo temperature that we note @xmath42 .",
    "both kondo scales , together with the singlet - triplet splitting , are reported on the schematic phase diagram of fig .",

    "[ fig3]a we identify two different regimes .",
    "far from the transition point , i.e. when the splitting @xmath30 exceeds the kondo temperature @xmath42 , the two spins are strongly coupled in a singlet state , and a non - equilibrium kondo effect involving the degenerate excited triplet state is observed , as previously discussed .",
    "the differential conductance exhibits a characteristic u - shape associated with the singlet - triplet gap , as shown by the widest curve in fig .",

    "good agreement is found with this formula as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]d . since the formation of the singlet state",

    "the good agreement confirms our interpretation of the critical domain ( region @xmath45 of fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) as a regular spin @xmath5 kondo effect experienced by one of the two spins .",
    "the second spin is disconnected from the leads in this energy range .",
    "we finally turn to the triplet region @xmath47 in fig .",
    "far from the transition point , at large gate voltage @xmath12 values , the spins are tightly bound into a triplet and a spin @xmath35 kondo effect is expected .",
    "estimates from both the width of the zero - bias peak and its magnetic field splitting ( not shown ) converge to a kondo scale @xmath41 of the order of @xmath61  mk .",

    "this is shown by the differential conductance , at fixed @xmath12 with lowering temperature , in fig .",
    "while a broad peak is again observed at high temperatures , a three - peak structure emerges upon cooling .",
    "we interpret the latter by a non - equilibrium kondo effect that mixes singlet and triplet states via the voltage bias window .",
    "we associate the former with a spin @xmath5 kondo effect , similarly to what occurs on the singlet side .",

    "the spin @xmath5 kondo behavior of @xmath57 extend down to the lowest temperatures by approaching the critical point , as @xmath33 becomes smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "this is most clearly displayed by the lower curve of the same plot , to which a fit with equation  ( [ spin1/2 ] ) can be successfully performed .",
    "the further increase of @xmath57 below 200mk is at present not fully understood , and may be related to the opening of a second screening channel , which would possibly spoil the quantum critical point at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , this extra feature seems related to a very small energy scale close to the crossing point , so that the interpretation of the data in the accessible temperature range is consistent with the quantum critical point scenario .",
    "we finally note that our data can be analyzed in a complementary way ( given in the supplementary information ) by plotting the zero - bias conductance as a fonction of gate voltage , for different temperatures . by cooling ,",
    "this shows the clear sharpening of a conductance step when the system crosses from singlet to triplet , in agreement with the existence of a quantum critical point  @xcite , and in contrast to the maximum predicted for an avoided transition  @xcite .",
    "we end by noting that the singlet - triplet transition in a @xmath0 molecular junction differs fundamentally from the observations in semiconductor  @xcite and nanotube  @xcite dots , thus showing the potentiality of combining well - controlled electromigration techniques with molecules of complex chemistry .    *",
