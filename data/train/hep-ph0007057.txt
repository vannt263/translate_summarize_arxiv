    "recent research on the determination of neutrino mass by studying the low - energy beta decay spectrum of tritium has produced a best fit value for @xmath0 which is significantly negative  @xcite .",
    "this unphysical value is caused by an anomalous excess of electron events at the end of the spectrum , at about 20 ev below the end point .",
    "the origin of this anomaly is not known .",
    "it seems clear that there is some systematic effect not taken into account , most probably of experimental nature .",
    "however , in this letter we want to point that an _ apparent _ excess of electron events near the end of the spectrum is compatible with a certain deviation of the relativistic dispersion relation for the neutrino . in this way",
    ", the tritium experimental results could be used to put bounds on the parameters characterizing this violation of lorentz symmetry .",
    "the idea that lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry , but an approximate one which works extremely well in our low - energy experiments , is not new . in the third section of this letter",
    "we will review the main proposals for modifications of the energy - momentum relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "there we will argue that a plausible dispersion relation for the neutrino , and only for this particle , is the following one : @xmath1 where @xmath2 means the module of the three - momentum @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the neutrino mass , and @xmath5 is some mass scale , to be determined afterwards .",
    "we will consider @xmath6 in order to have a positive contribution to the energy squared .",
    "let us see how the usual kurie plot of the tritium beta decay is modified by the dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) .",
    "the phase - space factor is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the momentum of the electron , @xmath9 is the kinetic energy of the electron ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is the energy available to distribute between the neutrino energy and the kinetic energy of the electron .",
    "@xmath11 is given by @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the masses of the initial and final nuclei .",
    "we are neglecting here the kinetic energy of the nucleus , which is typically of order @xmath15 ev . the kurie plot is proportional to the function @xmath16 given by @xmath17^{1/2 } \\ .\\ ] ] for the usual relativistic dispersion relations , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , one gets @xmath20^{1/2 } \\ , \\label{standardk}\\ ] ] which is a straight line , @xmath21 , in the case @xmath22 .    if one takes the new dispersion relation for the neutrino , eq .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) , then the function @xmath16 becomes ( from now on , we will use the notation @xmath23 ) @xmath24^{1/4}\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\left.\\frac{\\lambda}{\\left[(q - e)^2+\\lambda^2-m^2\\right]^{1/4}}\\right\\ } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to check that the end point of this curve is @xmath25 , just as in the standard case eq .",
    "( [ standardk ] ) . on the other hand , for large @xmath26 values",
    ", the curve is very well approximated by a straight line .",
    "considering a point @xmath27 so that @xmath28 , we introduce the linear approximation @xmath29 i.e. , it is the tangent to @xmath16 at the point @xmath30 .",
    "expanding @xmath31 in powers of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , we get @xmath34 so that , instead of having a straight line of slope @xmath35 ending at @xmath36 , which is the standard case with @xmath37 , we obtain a straight line of slope @xmath38 which ends at the point @xmath39 on the other hand , one can calculate the exact value of the slope at the end point : @xmath40    two cases are clearly distinguished : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvas ] .",
    "we see that near the end of the spectrum , the curve @xmath16 is above the linear approximation @xmath31 when @xmath41 , which corresponds to an _ apparent _ excess of electrons at high energies .",
    "indeed it is only apparent , because the curve lies always below the corresponding curve of a relativistic dispersion relation for a massless neutrino , which is also indicated in the figure . in the @xmath42 case",
    ", we get the oposite situation : the effect due to the neutrino mass dominates over the @xmath5 term ( responsible for the `` apparent excess '' ) and we get a reduction on the number of electrons at high energies .",
    "the tritium anomaly consists in an excess of electron events at high energies , where `` excess '' here means that the data stay above the straight line which is the linear approximation to the curve at low energies .",
    "a possible measure of the anomaly could be given by using the following quantity @xmath43 so that @xmath44 indicates an apparent excess of electrons at high energies .",
    "this quantity could be measured experimentally , and a comparison with the theoretical prediction would put bounds on the values of the parameters @xmath45 .",
    "we will show now the orders of magnitude of these bounds in a hypothetical but realistic example .    introducing the variable @xmath46 , and taking @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath48 is rewritten as follows : @xmath49 } { \\int_1^{1+\\frac{\\delta}{\\lambda } } { { \\mathrm{d}}}x \\ , \\sqrt{x } \\left[(x^2+\\alpha)^{1/4}-(x^2+\\alpha)^{-1/4}\\right ] } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig : r ] shows @xmath48 as a function of @xmath51 for different values of @xmath52 , that is , for different values of the quotient @xmath53 .",
    "experimentally , one could put a bound on the excess of electron events , that is , write @xmath54 for a certain value of @xmath55 , which should be chosen in an appropiate way .",
    "@xmath55 should be large enough , so that all the anomaly is contained in the region @xmath56 , but it should not be too large , because in that case @xmath57 . let us do an estimate of orders of magnitude . from table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the fit which gives @xmath58 , signal of the anomaly , is stable and has a good @xmath59 in a region between 200 and 400 ev before the end point , which is @xmath60 ev . let us take @xmath61 ev",
    ". an approximate value of @xmath48 comes then from fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which contains the experimental data for the kurie plot .",
    "@xmath48 is approximately given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the area of a triangle of base and height @xmath64 ( the straight line of the kurie plot has slope @xmath35 ) , and @xmath65 is the area delimited by the data above the straight line , spread in a range of energies of around 20 ev , and the line itself .",
    "a rough estimate of this area gives us a conservative value of @xmath66 .",
    "for the four curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] , corresponding to four different values of the quotient @xmath53 , we obtain bounds for @xmath51 , which , recalling that we have taken @xmath61 ev , produce bounds for @xmath5 which go from @xmath67 ev to @xmath68 ev for the extreme curves . again",
    ", this translates into bounds for the neutrino mass , depending on the value of @xmath52 . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the bound is @xmath70 ev , and for @xmath71 , we get @xmath72 ev .    we see that the tritium anomaly puts bounds for @xmath73 in a very interesting range ( a few ev ) .",
    "of course , a detailed analysis of the experimental data would give finer bounds to this kind of lorentz invariance violation .",
    "even more interesting would be a possible ( future ) experimental bound of the type @xmath74 , with @xmath75 ( that is , the confirmation of the anomaly ) , which would give a lower bound for @xmath5 , showing the presence of lorentz invariance violation effects in the tritium beta decay .",
    "special relativity and lorentz invariance are at the base of our low - energy effective theories . however , it may be possible that these are low - energy symmetries of a larger theory that do not need to be lorentz invariant .",
    "several attempts have been made to question lorentz invariance  @xcite and put bounds on possible violations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one way to explore the potentially observable effects of departures from exact lorentz invariance is to consider the consequences in low - energy processes of possible extensions of the lorentz - invariant particle energy - momentum relation compatible with translational and rotational invariance in a `` preferred frame '' . a first possibility is given by the lorentz - violating class of dispersion relations  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath13 is the natural mass scale of the lorentz non - invariant fundamental theory .",
    "an analysis of cosmic ray processes , whose thresholds are drastically changed by the new dispersion relation , puts severe bounds on the scale of the lorentz violation : @xmath13 has to be several orders of magnitude larger than the planck mass scale  @xcite .",
    "another possible extension of the energy - momentum relation , coming from the introduction of a rotationally invariant two - derivative term in the free lagrangian , is  @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a small coefficient which fixes the maximal attainable velocity of each particle ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "differences among maximal attainable velocities of different particles lead to abrupt effects when the dimensionless ratio @xmath80 is of order unity .",
    "the precise tests of special relativity give very strong constraints on this type of extension  @xcite ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "a discussion of departures from exact lorentz invariance in terms of modifications of the energy - momentum relation leads to consider a third possible extension of the dispersion relation with a term linear in @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath82 the additional term dominates over the standard kinetic term ( @xmath83 ) when @xmath84 and then the nonrelativistic kinematics is drastically changed",
    ". therefore this type of generalized dispersion relation has to be excluded , except just for one case .",
    "the neutrino has two characteristic properties : it has a very small mass , and it interacts only weakly . as a result of this combination , we have not any experimental result on its nonrelativistic physics .",
    "therefore , the presence of lorentz invariance violations affecting the nonrelativistic limit can not be excluded a priori in the neutrino case .",
    "one possible way to incorporate a departure of lorentz invariance affecting only to the neutrinos is to assume that the presence of a linear term in the dispersion relation is due to a new interaction which acts as a messenger of the lorentz non - invariance at high energies . once again , this is not a weird assumption : the introduction of new interactions is a general practice in the different attempts to explain the smallness of neutrino masses  @xcite .    in conclusion , a dispersion relation of the form  ( [ disprel ] ) can be considered for the neutrino at low energies .",
    "we still assume the existence of further lorentz noninvariant terms , as those contained in eqs .",
    "( [ ep1 ] ) and  ( [ ep2 ] ) , for the neutrino as well as for all other particles . in the rest of the letter , we turn our attention to other implications of eq .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) .",
    "let us first concentrate on the influence on a characteristic low - energy phenomenon for the neutrino : flavour oscillations . in the case of a lorentz invariance violation independent of flavour ,",
    "that is , @xmath85 one gets the result @xmath86 so that there is not any footprint of lorentz noninvariance in neutrino oscillations .",
    "if we admit a possible dependence of @xmath5 on the flavour , we get @xmath87 and the oscillation probability becomes @xmath88\\right ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which means an energy independent probability ( which goes against the experimental observations in solar neutrino oscillations ) unless @xmath89 where we have used that @xmath90 km , and @xmath91",
    ". there will be no footprint of lorentz invariance violations in the case of atmospheric neutrinos , since @xmath92 , nor in accelerator experiments , with much smaller lengths .",
    "the conclusion is that the linear term in @xmath2 in the generalized dispersion relation  ( [ disprel ] ) has to be flavour - independent .      the bounds on neutrino masses from their contribution to the energy density of the universe  @xcite",
    "are not affected by the presence of lorentz invariance violations , since they only depend on the minimum energy of the neutrino , which is still @xmath93 ( for @xmath94 ) , independently of @xmath5 .",
    "the spread of arrival times of the neutrinos from sn1987a , coupled with the measured neutrino energies , provides a simple time - of - flight limit on @xmath95 .    from eq .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) one has for the neutrino velocity @xmath96 since @xmath97 , the limit  @xcite ( 23 ev ) can be taken as an upper limit for @xmath98 which is not far away from the range of parameters suggested by the tritium beta - decay anomaly .",
    "then , neutrinos from supernovas can be a good place to look for footprints of lorentz invariance violations .",
    "in fact , we see another implication from eq .  ( [ beta ] ) if @xmath41 : neutrinos travel faster than light , so that those carrying more energy will be the latest to arrive , in contrast with the case of a relativistic dispersion relation .      a striking consequence of the presence of the @xmath5-term in the generalized neutrino dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) is the kinematic prohibition of reactions involving neutrinos at a certain energy .",
    "let us consider ordinary neutron decay : @xmath99 .",
    "at large momentum , the @xmath5-term , which is proportional to @xmath2 , represents a large contribution to the energy balance , so that the process might be forbidden for neutrons of sufficiently high momentum .",
    "this turns out to be the case : it is easy to see that for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the total energy of the final state is bounded from below , @xmath102 which implies that _ neutrons with momentum _",
    "@xmath103{\\mathrm{(ev)}}\\ ] ] _ are stable particles . _",
    "a similar conclusion is obtained in the case of pions : the desintegration @xmath104 is forbidden",
    "if the pion has a momentum @xmath105 { \\mathrm{(ev ) } } \\ .\\ ] ]    this means that pions and neutrons with these energies can form part of cosmic rays , since they are stable particles if the neutrino energy - momentum relation is given by eq .",
    "( [ disprel ] ) . therefore , cosmic ray physics might be drastically affected at high energies , of order @xmath106@xmath107 ev .",
    "in particular , the presence of stable neutrons and pions in cosmic rays at such energies might contribute to avoiding the well - known gzk cutoff  @xcite .",
    "it is surprising that a very simple extension of the lorentz invariant dispersion relation for the neutrino , consistent with all the constraints from neutrino physics , can affect phenomena of such different energy ranges .",
    "it could be behind the tritium beta - decay anomaly , and also lead to a drastic change in the composition of cosmic rays beyond @xmath107 ev .",
    "it seems worthwhile to explore in more detail all the consequences of this violation of lorentz invariance and possible models of the lorentz non - invariant physics at high energies incorporating the extended neutrino dispersion relation considered in this letter as a low - energy remnant .",
