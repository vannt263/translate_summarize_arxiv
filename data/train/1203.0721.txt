    "the study of mathematical models describing collective behavior and synchronized motion of animals , like bird flocks , fish schools and insect swarms , has attracted a lot of attention in recent years  @xcite . in biological systems such behaviors",
    "are observed in every level of the food chain , from the swarm intelligence of the zoo plankton , to bird flocking and fish schools , to mammals moving in formation  @xcite . beside biology ,",
    "emerging collective behaviors play a relevant role in several applications involving the dynamics of a large number of individuals / particles which range from computer science  @xcite , physics  @xcite and engineering  @xcite to social sciences and economy  @xcite .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a recent review of some of the mathematical topics and the applications involved .    naturally occurring",
    "synchronized motion has inspired several directions of research within the control community . a well - known application is related to formation flying missions and missions involving the coordinated control of several autonomous vehicles  @xcite .",
    "there are several current projects which are dealing with the formation flying and coordinated control of satellites , like the darwin project of the european space agency ( esa ) with the goal of launching a space - based telescope aiding in the search for possible life - supporting planets , or the prisma project led by the swedish space corporation ( ssc ) which will be the first real formation flying space mission launched  @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we will focus on general models which are capable to reproduce flocking , swarming and other collective behaviors .",
    "most of the classical models describing these phenomena are based on the simple definition of three interacting zones , the so called _ three - zones model _",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarize the three - zones assumptions .",
    "we define three regions around each individual : a short - range repulsion zone , an intermediate velocity alignment zone and a long - range attraction zone ( see figure  [ fig : zonemodel ] ) .",
    "each interaction between individuals is evaluated accordingly to the relative position in the model .        * _ repulsion zone : _ when individuals are too close each other they tend to move away from that area . * _ alignment zone : _ individuals try to identify the possible direction of the group and to align with it . * _ attraction zone : _ when individuals are too far from the group they want to get closer .",
    "typically different interaction models are taken in the different zones  @xcite or the modelling is focused on a specific zone , like the alignment / consensus dynamic  @xcite .",
    "of course the particular shape and size of the zones depends on the specific application considered .",
    "for example recent studied on birds flocks suggest that each bird modifies its position , relative to few individuals directly surrounding it , no matter how close or how far away those individuals are  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear however if this applies also to other kind of animals .",
    "studying this kind of dynamics for large system of individuals implies a considerable effort in numerical simulations , microscopic models based on real data my take into account very large numbers of interacting individuals ( from several hundred thousands up to millions ) .",
    "computationally the problems have the same structure of many classical problems in computational physics which require the evaluation of all pairwise long range interactions in a large ensembles of particles .",
    "the @xmath0-body problem of gravitation ( or electrostatics ) is a classical example .",
    "such problems involve the evaluation of summations of the type @xmath4 a direct evaluation of such sums at @xmath0 target points clearly requires @xmath1 operations and algorithms which reduce the cost to @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 etc .",
    "are referred to as _",
    "fast summation methods_. for uniform grid data the most famous of these is certainly the fast fourier transform ( fft ) . in the case of general data",
    "most fast summation methods are approximate methods based on analytical considerations , like the _ fast multipole _ method  @xcite ,",
    "_ wavelets transform _ methods  @xcite and , more recently , dimension reduction using _ compressive sampling _ techniques  @xcite , or based on some _ monte carlo _ strategies at different levels  @xcite .",
    "extensions of the above mentioned approaches to kinetic equations are discussed for example in  @xcite .    from a mathematical modeling point of view",
    ", these problem have been developed extensively in the kinetic research community ( see   @xcite ) where the derivation of kinetic and an hydrodynamic equations represent a first step towards the reduction of the computational complexity .",
    "of course , passing from a microscopic description based on phase - space particles @xmath8 to a mesoscopic level where the object of study is a particle distribution function @xmath9 redefines the model in a new one where new methods of solution are required .    in this paper we are going to follow this research path in two main directions : first we review the derivation of the different kinetic approximations from the original microscopic models and then we introduce and analyze several stochastic monte carlo methods to approximate the kinetic equations .",
    "monte carlo methods are the most well - known approach for the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation of rarefied gases in the short - range interactions , and many efficient algorithms have been presented  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the literature on efficient monte carlo strategies for long - range interactions , and thus landau - fokker - plank equations , is much less developed but of great interest in the field of plasma physics  @xcite .",
    "here , inspired by the techniques introduced in  @xcite for plasma , we develop direct simulation monte carlo methods based on a binary collision dynamic described by the corresponding kinetic equation .",
    "the methods permit to approximate the microscopic dynamic at a cost directly proportional to the number of sample particles involved in the computation , thus avoiding the quadratic computational cost .",
    "the limiting behavior characterizing the mean - field interaction process of the particles system is recovered under a suitable asymptotic scaling of the binary collision process .",
    "in such a limit we show that the monte carlo methods here developed are in very good agreement with the direct evaluation of the original microscopic model but with a considerable gain of computational efficiency .",
    "the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows . in the first section we present some of the classical microscopic models for flocking and swarming .",
    "generalization of the notion of visual cone  @xcite are also discussed .",
    "since the interaction is non local , the derivation of the limiting mean - field kinetic equation is made through a _ povzner - boltzmann _ kinetic equation  @xcite in the anologous situation of the so - called _ grazing collision limit _",
    "@xcite . to solve the resulting boltzmann - like mesoscopic partial differential equation",
    "we introduce different stochastic binary interaction algorithms and compare their computational efficiency and accuracy with a direct evaluation of the microscopic models and a stochastic approximation of the mean - field kinetic model .",
    "we show that the new approach permits to reduce the overall cost from @xmath1 to @xmath3 operations .",
    "in particular we show that the choice @xmath10 , where @xmath2 is the small scaling parameter leading to the mean field kinetic model , originates binary interaction algorithms consistent with the limiting behavior of the particle system .",
    "furthermore , in contrast with classical methods  @xcite , the nature of the approximating equations is such that the resulting monte carlo algorithms are fully mesh less . in the last section of the paper we report several simulations in two and three space dimensions of different microscopic models solved by the binary monte carlo method in the above scaling .",
    "in this section we review some well - known microscopic models of flocking and swarming ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we are interested in the study of a dynamical system composed of @xmath0 individuals with the following general structure @xmath11\\psi_{\\alpha}(x_i , x_j , v_i )          \\end{array}\\right .",

    "cucker and smale model is a pure alignment model , no repulsion or attraction or other effects are taken in account , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the classical model reads as follow @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a function that measures the strength of the interaction between individuals @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and depends on the mutual distance , under the assumption that closer individuals have more influence than the far distance ones .",
    "a typical choice of function @xmath25 is the following @xmath26 where @xmath27 are positive parameters and @xmath28 .     in cucker - smale model ]    under this assumptions it can be shown that well - posedness holds for the initial value problem of ( [ cuckersmale ] ) and the solution is mass and momentum preserving , with compact support for position and velocity , see @xcite .",
    "moreover in @xcite it was established that the parameter @xmath29 discriminate the behavior of the solution , in the following way    let @xmath30 and @xmath31 . if @xmath32 then    a.   exist a positive costant @xmath33 such that : @xmath34 for all @xmath35",
    ". b.   @xmath36 converge towards zero as @xmath37 . c.   the vector @xmath38 tends to a limit vector @xmath39 , for all @xmath40 .",
    "in other words , the velocity support collapses exponentially to a single point and the flock holds the same disposition . from this theorem we recover the notion of _ unconditional flocking _ in the regime @xmath41 . if @xmath42 in general unconditional flocking does nt follow , but under some conditions on initial data flocking condition is reached , see @xcite .    note",
    "that standard cucker - smale model prescribes perfectly symmetric interactions and takes in account only the alignment dynamic . as a result total momentum",
    "is preserved by the dynamics .",
    "the introduction of a limited space perception ( like a visual cone ) breaks symmetry and momentum conservation .",
    "this choice corresponds to take a function for the strength of the interaction of the type @xmath43 where the parameter vector @xmath20 is related , for example , to the width of the visual cone .      the microscopic model introduced by dorsogna , bertozzi et al .",
    "@xcite considers a self - propelling , attraction and repulsion dynamic and reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 are nonnegative parameters , @xmath47 is a given potential modeling the short - range repulsion and long - range attraction , and @xmath0 is the number of individuals .",
    "function @xmath48 gives us the attraction - repulsion dynamic typically described by a _",
    "morse potential _",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 are positive constants measuring the strengths and the characteristic lengths of the attraction and repulsion . in ( [ model_bert ] )",
    "the term @xmath51 characterizes _ self - propulsion _ and _",
    "friction_. asymptotically this term give us a desired velocity , in fact for large times the velocity of every single particle tends to @xmath52 .",
    "the most interesting case in biological applications occurs when the constants in the morse potential satisfy the following inequalities @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which correspond to the long range attraction and short range repulsion .",
    "moreover the choice of the parameters fixes the evolution of the @xmath0 particles system towards a particular equilibrium .",
    "the following distinction holds : if @xmath55 then crystalline patterns are observed and for @xmath56 the motion of particles converges to a circular motion of constant speed , where @xmath57 is the space dimension . in @xcite a further study of the parameters can be found .          in a recent work @xcite",
    "the authors propose a modification of the classical cucker - smale model as follows @xmath58 where @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 the model differs from the classical one , since the influence between two particles @xmath61 is weighted by the average influence on the single individual @xmath23 . in this way",
    "the function @xmath62 lose in general any kind of symmetry property of the original cucker - smale dynamic .",
    "we emphasize , however , that in our general setting this model is included in the cucker - smale alignment dynamic of type ( [ csh2 ] ) with a particular choice for the function defining the space perception of the form @xmath63 this can be interpreted as a higher perception level of zones where the individuals have a higher concentration and a lower interest in zones where individuals are more scattered .      for interacting animals like birds , fishes , insects the visual perception of the single individual plays a fundamental role  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors introduce in the dynamic a further rule : the _ visual cone_. a visual cone identifies the area in which interaction is possible and blind area where can not be interaction . mathematically speaking the visual cone",
    "depends on an angle , @xmath64 , that give us the visual width .",
    "together with position and velocity the visual area can be described as follows @xmath65 as already discussed the introduction of a visual cone breaks the typical symmetry of the interaction ( see figure [ fig : zonemodelcone ] ) .     is perceived by individual @xmath23 but not vice versa . ]",
    "the drawback of this choice is that a single individual that has no one in his visual cone , never changes his direction . for real situations",
    "this assumption is clearly too strong , since many other stimuli are received by the surrounding .",
    "we can not ignore other perceptions like hearing , smell and visual memory .",
    "for example fishes use their visual perception mostly on large / medium distance whereas on medium / short distance they rely on their lateral line .",
    "these observations lead naturally to improve the idea of a visual cone by introducing a _ perception cone _ as follows : we assign two different weights measuring the strength / probability of the interaction . a weight @xmath66 in the case of strong perception and @xmath67 in case of weak perception , with @xmath68 .",
    "note that taking @xmath69 and @xmath70 we have the standard visual cone .",
    "for example , in the simulation section we consider a perception cone @xmath71 , @xmath72 , with the following form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the indicator function of the set @xmath75 defined according to ( [ eq : cono ] ) .",
    "related efforts to improve the dynamic consider also different ingredients like _ topological interactions _ where individuals interact only with the closest individuals and with a limited number of them , see @xcite .",
    "another variant concerns the introduction of a term describing a _ roosting force _  @xcite .",
    "in fact , flocking phenomena tends to stay localized in a particular area , this force acts orthogonal to the single velocity , giving each particle a tendency towards the origin .",
    "for a realistic numerical simulation of a flock the number of interacting individuals can be rather large , thus we need to solve a very large system of odes , which can constitute a serious difficulty . an alternative way to tackle",
    "this problem is to consider a nonnegative distribution function @xmath9 describing the number density of individuals at time @xmath76 in position @xmath77 with velocity @xmath78 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath9 is characterized by a kinetic equation which takes into account the motion of individuals due to their own velocity and the velocity changes due to the interactions with other individuals . following  @xcite we consider here binary interaction boltzmann - type and mean - field kinetic approximation of the microscopic dynamics .      in agreement with ( [ cuckersmale ] ) and ( [ csh2 ] )",
    ", we consider a microscopic binary interaction between two individuals with positions and velocities @xmath79 and @xmath80 according to @xmath81 where @xmath82 are the _ post - interaction _ velocities and @xmath83 a parameter that measures the strength of the interaction .",
    "analogous binary interactions can be introduced for other swarming and flocking dynamics like dorsogna - bertozzi .",
    "we describe the interaction of the sistem with following integro - differential equation of boltzmann type @xmath84   \\label{q_boltz }      \\\\[-.25 cm ]      \\nonumber          q(f , f)=\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^{2d}}(\\frac{1}{j}f(x , v_*,t)f(y , w_*,t)-f(x , v , t)f(y , w , t))dw dy ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 are the _ pre - interacting _ velocity that generate the couple @xmath86 according to ( [ binary ] ) , @xmath87 is the jacobian of the transformation of @xmath86 to @xmath85 . without visual limitation",
    "the jacobian reads @xmath88 .",
    "note that , at variance with classical boltzmann equation the interaction is non local as in povzner kinetic model @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the time scaling @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a constant and @xmath2 a small parameter .",
    "the scaling corresponds to assume that the parameter @xmath83 characterizing the strength of the microscopic interactions is small , thus the frequency of interactions has to increase otherwise the collisional integral will vanish .",
    "this corresponds to large scale interaction frequencies and small interaction strengths , in agreement with a classical mean - field limit and similarly to the so - called _ grazing collision limit _ of the boltzmann equation for granular gases  @xcite .",
    "first of all let us remark that the dynamic ( [ binary ] ) does nt preserve the momentum , as consequence of the velocity dependent function @xmath91 we have @xmath92 moreover under the assumptions @xmath93 and @xmath94 , it is easy to prove that the support of velocity is limited by initial condition @xmath95    considering now the weak formulation of ( [ q_boltz ] ) the jacobian term disappears and we get the rescaled equation @xmath96          \\label{weak }          \\\\[-.25cm]\\nonumber          \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^{4d}}(\\phi(x , v^*)-\\phi(x , v))f(x , v , t)f(y , w , t)dv dx dw dy ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath97 and for all @xmath98 , such that @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the starting density .",

    "following  @xcite , if we add in ( [ cuckersmale ] ) a nonlinear noise term depending on function @xmath91 and perform essentially the same derivation of the above paragraph we obtain the kinetic equation @xmath117+\\sigma\\delta_v ( h_\\alpha*\\rho)f ,      \\label{kinetic_diff}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 represent the mass of the system and @xmath124 the strength of the noise . if @xmath125 , the right hand side can be written as a fokker - plank operator @xmath126 and thus a _",
    "global maxwellian function _ is a steady state solution for the equation ( [ kinetic_diff ] ) .      in this section",
    "we present some alternative formulations of the boltzmann equation describing the binary interaction dynamics for alignment .",
    "all the formulations share the property that in the mean - field limit originate the same kinetic model ( [ kinetic ] ) .",
    "the boltzmann equation ( [ q_boltz ] ) has much in common with a classical boltzmann equation for maxwell molecules , in the sense that the collision frequency is independent of the velocity and position of individuals .",
    "an alternative boltzmann - like kinetic approximation is obtained with the interaction operator @xmath127 where now @xmath128 from the modeling viewpoint here the function @xmath91 is interpreted as the frequency of interactions instead of the strength of the same interactions .",
    "clearly the two formulations ( [ q_boltz ] ) and ( [ q_boltz2 ] ) are not equivalent in general .",
    "it is easy to verify that formally we obtain the same mean - field limit ( [ kinetic ] ) .",
    "note however that now the second order term in the expansion ( [ taylor ] ) is slightly different and reads @xmath129 h_\\alpha(x , y , v ) f(x , v , t)f(y , w , t)dv dx dw dy.\\ ] ] since @xmath130 , in practice we may expect a slower convergence to the mean - field dynamic for small values of @xmath2 .",
    "let us finally introduce some stochastic effect in the visual cone perception by defining @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a random variable distributed accordingly to some @xmath133 s.t .",
    "@xmath134 then the collision term in the form ( [ q_boltz ] ) becomes @xmath135 whereas in the space dependent interaction frequency form ( [ q_boltz2 ] ) reads @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "again it can be shown that thanks to ( [ eq : bb ] ) the limit asymptotic behavior @xmath107 is unchanged .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "we conclude the section reporting an example of distribution for the random variable @xmath132 which corresponds to the stochastic analogue of ( [ hhh ] ) @xmath138",
    "following  @xcite we introduce different numerical approaches for the above kinetic equations based on monte carlo methods .",
    "the main idea is to approximate the dynamic by solving the boltzmann - like models for small value of @xmath2 .",
    "we will also develop some direct monte carlo techniques for the limiting kinetic equation ( [ kinetic ] ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we describe the algorithms in the case of the collision operator ( [ q_boltz ] ) , extensions to the other possible formulations presented in section 3 are also discussed along the section .",
    "as we will see , thanks to the structure of the equations , the resulting algorithms are fully meshless .      as in most monte carlo methods for kinetic equations ,",
    "see  @xcite , the starting point is a splitting method based on evaluating in two different steps the transport and collisional part of the scaled boltzmann - povzner equation @xmath139 @xmath140 where we used the notation @xmath141 to denote the scaled boltzmann operator ( [ q_boltz ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the solution to the collision step for small values of @xmath2 has very little in common with the classical fluid - limit of the boltzmann equation .",
    "here in fact the whole collision process depends on space and on the small scaling parameter @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , in the small @xmath2 limit the solution is expected to converge towards the solution of the mean - field model ( [ kinetic ] ) .    by decomposing the collisional operator in equation ( [ coll ] ) in its gain and loss parts we can rewrite the collision step as @xmath142 ,      \\label{coll_mod}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 represent the total mass and @xmath144 the _ gain _ part of the collisional operator . without loss of generality in the sequel",
    "we assume that @xmath145 in order to solve the trasport step we use the exact free flow of the sample particles @xmath8 in a time interval @xmath146 @xmath147 and thus describe the different schemes used for the interaction process in the form ( [ coll_mod ] ) .",
    "let us now consider a time interval @xmath148 $ ] discretized in @xmath149 intervals of size @xmath146 .",
    "we denote by @xmath150 the approximation of @xmath151 .",
    "thus the forward euler scheme writes @xmath152 where since @xmath150 is a probability density , thanks to mass conservation , also @xmath153 is a probability density . under the restriction",
