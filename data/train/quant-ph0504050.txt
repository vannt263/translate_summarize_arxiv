    "the novel possibilities that quantum mechanics brings to information processing have been the subject of intense study in recent years . in particular ,",
    "much interest has been devoted to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of quantum computing as it pertains to important problems in computer science and physics .",
    "an important part of this research program consists of understanding which families of quantum systems are _ computationally complex_. this complexity can manifest itself in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", a positive result shows that a given family of systems is  complicated enough \" to efficiently implement universal quantum computation . on the other hand",
    ", a negative result shows that certain questions about such systems are unlikely to be efficiently answerable .",
    "a proof of qma - completeness offers compelling evidence of the negative kind while also locating the given problem in the complexity hierarchy , since qma , the class of decision problems that can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer with access to a quantum witness , is analogous to the classical complexity classes np and ma .",
    "more precisely , the class qma is defined as    a _ promise problem _ @xmath1 is in qma if there is an efficient ( of @xmath2 size ) uniform quantum circuit family @xmath3 such that xl_yes , |_x ^(|x| ) , & prob(v_x(|_x_x|)=1 ) 2/3 , and xl_no , | ^(|x| ) , & prob(v_x(||)=1 ) 1/3 .",
    "the work on finding qma - complete problems was jump - started by a ` quantum cook - levin theorem ' proved by kitaev @xcite ( see also the survey @xcite ) .",
    "kitaev showed that the promise problem @xmath0-local hamiltonian for @xmath4 is qma - complete .",
    "before we state this problem , let us review some definitions .",
    "a hamiltonian is a hermitian operator .",
    "a hamiltonian on @xmath5 qubits is @xmath0-local for constant @xmath0 if it can be written as @xmath6 where each term @xmath7 acts non - trivially on at most @xmath0 qubits and thus @xmath8 .",

    "the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath11 , sometimes called the ` ground state energy ' of @xmath11 , will be denoted as @xmath12 .    with these definitions in place",

    "the problem is to decide whether @xmath15 . when @xmath17 we say we have a ` yes - instance ' .",
    "kitaev s result was strengthened in ref .",

    "the subsequent @xcite proved that also 2-local hamiltonian is qma - complete .    in another direction it was first shown by aharonov _",
    "_ @xcite that adiabatic quantum computation using 3-local hamiltonians is computationally equivalent to quantum computation in the circuit model . in the adiabatic computation paradigm one starts the computation in the ground - state , i.e. the eigenstate with smallest eigenvalue , of some hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "the computation proceeds by slowly ( at a rate at most @xmath10 ) changing the parameters of the hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "the adiabatic theorem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an accessible proof thereof ) states essentially that if the instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath19 has a sufficiently large spectral gap , ",
    "i.e. the difference between the second smallest eigenvalue and the smallest eigenvalue is @xmath20 , then the state at time @xmath21 during the evolution is close to the ground - state of the instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath19 . at the end of the computation ( @xmath22 ) ,",

    "@xcite improved on the result by aharonov _",
    "et al . _ by showing that any efficient quantum computation can be efficiently simulated by an adiabatic computation employing only 2-local hamiltonians .",
    "these results on the complexity of hamiltonians can be viewed as the first ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) in a field that is still largely unexplored as compared to the classical case .",
    "the class of hamiltonian problems is likely to be a very important class of problems in qma .",
    "hamiltonians govern the dynamics of quantum systems and as such contain all the physically important information about a quantum system .",
    "the problem of determining properties of the spectrum , in particular the ground state ( energy ) or the low - lying excitations , is a well - known problem for which a variety of methods , both numerical and analytical , ( see e.g. ) have been developed .",
    "furthermore , finding qma - complete problems may help us in finding new problems that are in bqp .",
    "let us briefly review the classical situation . in some sense",
    "the 2-local hamiltonian problem is similar to the max-2-sat problem @xcite .",
    "but perhaps a better analogue is",
    "the set of problems defined with ` classical ' hamiltonians such as ising spin glass :    given is an interaction graph @xmath24 with hamiltonian h_g=_i , j e j_ij z_i z_j+_iv _ i z_i . here",

    "the problem is to decide whether @xmath28 for a given @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that the problem ising spin glass , which is a special case of the 2-local hamiltonian problem , is np - complete on a planar graph .",
    "in fact , it is even np - complete on a planar graph when @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prove some results on the complexity of a quantum version of this model , a quantum spin glass .",
    "our results are based on two ideas .",
    "the first one is a small modification to the ` quantum cook - levin ' circuit - to-5-local hamiltonian construction that will prove qma - completeness of a 5-local hamiltonian on a ` spatially sparse ' hypergraph ( to be defined below )",
    ". such qma - completeness result on a spatially sparse hypergraph could also have been obtained from the 6-dim particle hamiltonian on a 2d lattice that was constructed in @xcite .",
    "secondly , we introduce a set of mediator qubit gadgets to manipulate @xmath0-local interactions . these gadgets can be used to reduce any @xmath0-local interaction for constant @xmath0 to a 2-local interaction",
    ". then we use the gadgets to reduce a 2-local hamiltonian on a spatially sparse graph to a 2-local hamiltonian on a planar graph , or alternatively to a 2-local hamiltonian on a 2d lattice .",
    "the general technique is based on the idea of perturbation gadgets introduced in ref .",
    "however the gadgets that we introduce here are more general and more powerful than the one in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "before we state the results , let us give a few more useful definitions . with a 2-local hamiltonian @xmath32 acting on @xmath5 qubits we can associate an _ interaction graph _",
    "@xmath24 with @xmath33 . for every edge in @xmath34 between vertices @xmath35 and",

    "we also use the following definition of a spatially sparse hypergraph . a spatially sparse interaction ( hyper)graph @xmath41",
    "is defined as a ( hyper)graph in which ( i ) every vertex participates in @xmath42 hyper - edges , ( ii ) there is a straight - line drawing in the plane such that every hyper - edge overlaps with @xmath42 other hyper - edges and the surface covered by every hyper - edge is @xmath42 .",
    "a pauli edge of an interaction graph @xmath41 is an edge between vertices @xmath35 and @xmath36 associated with an operator @xmath43 where @xmath44 are pauli matrices @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath27 and @xmath47 is some real number . for an interaction graph",

    "@xmath52 , resp .",
    "@xmath53 ) .    we will prove the following results .",
    "first we show that    2-local hamiltonian on a planar graph with maximum pauli degree equal to 3 is qma - complete .",
    "[ theo : degree4 ]    with only a little more work , we prove that    with pauli interactions on a subgraph of the 2-d square lattice is qma - complete .",
    "[ theo : squarelat ]    lastly , we answer an open problem in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see section [ sec : adiabatic ] for a more detailed statement of the result ) , namely that :    [ thm : adiabatic]universal quantum computation can be efficiently simulated by a quantum adiabatic evolution of qubits interacting on a 2-d square lattice .",
    "we believe that our theorem [ theo : squarelat ] is in some sense the strongest result that one can expect for qubits , since we consider it unlikely that 2-local hamiltonian restricted to a linear chain of qubits is qma - complete .",
    "a recent surprising result in this respect is that 2-local hamiltonian on a one - dimensional lattice with 12-dimensional _ qudits _ is qma - complete @xcite . with regards to theorem  [ thm : adiabatic ]",
    ", one should note that aharonov _",
    "@xcite had already proven that interactions of six - dimensional particles on a two - dimensional square lattice suffice for universal quantum adiabatic computation .",
    "our improvement to qubits on a two - dimensional lattice is an application of our perturbation gadgets to @xcite s 6-dim particle construction .",
    "we would like to draw attention to the power of the perturbative method and in particular to the gadgets that we develop in this paper .",
    "there are a variety of interesting states that can be defined as the ground - states or ground - spaces of @xmath0-local hamiltonians .",
    "prime examples are the stabilizer states where the hamiltonian equals @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a set of commuting stabilizer operators .",
    "the ground - space is formed by all states with @xmath56 eigenvalue with respect to the stabilizer @xmath57 and this space is separated by a constant gap from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "an example is the cluster state @xcite , the toric code space @xcite or any stabilizer code space .",
    "typically , the stabilizer operators @xmath58 are @xmath0-local with @xmath59 which seems to preclude the generation of such ground - space as the ground - space of a _",
    "hamiltonian , see the arguments in ref .",
    "the perturbative gadgets introduced in this paper show how to generate a 2-local hamiltonian which has a ground - space with is _ approximately _ a product of a trivial ancilla - qubit space times the ground - space of the desired @xmath0-local hamiltonian .",
    "thus the use of ancillas and the use of approximation get us past the constraints derived in @xcite . if the original @xmath0-local hamiltonian has some restricted spatial structure , one can show that the resulting 2-local hamiltonian can be defined on a planar graph or , if desired , on a 2-d lattice .    in the appendix of this paper",
    "we prove a stronger perturbation theorem than what has been shown in @xcite .",
    "the results in the appendix show that under the appropriate conditions the perturbative method does not only reproduce the eigenvalues of the target hamiltonian , but also the eigenstates , possibly restricted to the low - lying levels of the target hamiltonian .",
    "we believe that these results may have applications beyond reductions in qma and the adiabatic universality results in section [ sec : adiabatic ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:5loc ]",
    "we show how to modify kitaev s original 5-local hamiltonian construction @xcite to a 5-local hamiltonian with interactions restricted to a spatially sparse hypergraph . in section [ sec : gadgets ] we introduce our perturbation gadgets and in section [ sec : medqubits ] we show how to go from a 5-local to a 2-local hamiltonian using our basic mediator qubit gadget . in section [ compgadgets ]",
    "we use new variants of the basic gadget to further reduce the 2-local hamiltonian on a spatially sparse hypergraph to a 2-local hamiltonian on a planar graph of pauli degree at most 3 , theorem [ theo : degree4 ] . with a bit more work",
    "we reduce it to a 2-local hamiltonian on a 2-d square lattice , theorem [ theo : squarelat ] .",
    "finally , section  @xmath60 presents the proof that adiabatic quantum computation using 2-local hamiltonians on a 2d lattice is computationally universal ( theorem  [ thm : adiabatic ] ) .",
    "we start by modifying the proof that 5-local hamiltonian is qma - complete in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the essential insight is ( 1 ) to modify any quantum circuit to one in which any qubit is used a constant number of times and ( 2 ) make sure that the program to execute the gates in the correct time sequence is spatially local .",
    "we note that some of the ideas in this section are quite similar to those behind the adiabatic 2d - lattice hamiltonian construction with @xmath62-dim particles in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let a quantum circuit use @xmath63 qubits where @xmath5 qubits are input qubits and the other @xmath64 qubits are ancilla qubits .",
    "we first modify this circuit such that gates are executed in @xmath65 ` rounds ' where in every round only @xmath66 ( non - trivial ) gate is performed . after a round , the @xmath63 qubits are swapped to a next row of @xmath63 qubits and then the next gate in the original circuit is executed .",
    "the total number of qubits in this modified circuit is @xmath67 .",
    "the rows of @xmath63 qubits for different rounds @xmath68 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] .",
    "let us specify an order in which the swap and gate operations are executed . in the first round @xmath69 we start by applying gates , @xmath70 and the non - trivial gate , with the qubit on the left in figure [ fig : layout ] .",
    "after this round , the swapping starts with the qubit on the right .",
    "then again the @xmath71 gate - round starts with qubits on the left etc .",
    "if we label the gates ( including @xmath70 ) with a time - index depending on when they are executed , then it is clear that in this model time changes in a spatially local fashion .",
    "we also note that in our construction , each physical qubit enters a gate at most @xmath72 times , twice in a swap gate , and once in a @xmath70 gate or a nontrivial gate .        in the class qma",
    "the verifier arthur uses a verifying quantum circuit @xmath73 for an instance @xmath74 .",
    "we will use the fact that we can always replace such verifying quantum circuit by a modified verifying circuit with the properties that we derived above .    given any instance @xmath74 of a promise problem @xmath75 and the verification circuit @xmath73",
    ", we will construct a 5-local hamiltonian @xmath76 such that    * if on some input @xmath77 @xmath73 accepts with probability more than @xmath78 ( @xmath74 is a yes - instance ) , then @xmath76 has an eigenvalue less than @xmath79 for some polynomial @xmath80 . *",
    "if @xmath73 accepts with probability less than @xmath81 then all eigenvalues of @xmath76 are larger than @xmath82 for some polynomial @xmath83 .",
    "thus we can map each promise problem in qma onto a 5-local hamiltonian problem where the specific restricted form of arthur s verifying circuit will lead to restrictions on the interactions in the 5-local hamiltonian , that is , the interaction hypergraph will be spatially sparse . in particular , when @xmath84 for a @xmath5 qubit proof from merlin , we obtain a hamiltonian which obeys the promise in definition 2 . note that definition 1 uses @xmath85 but it has been shown , see e.g. @xcite , that one can make the error @xmath84 for a @xmath5 qubit proof input .",
    "thus , these arguments will prove that the 5-local hamiltonian problem on a so - called spatially sparse hypergraph is qma - hard .",
    "since it is also known that 5-local hamiltonian is in qma @xcite , this proves the qma - completeness of 5-local hamiltonian on a spatially sparse hypergraph .",
    "let us now look at the details of mapping a qma circuit onto a hamiltonian problem .",
    "our construction is a small modification from the standard construction by kitaev @xcite .",

    "@xmath96 is the only term that is different from the @xmath61-local hamiltonian considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it uses the definition of a set of special times @xmath97 .",
    "before we define these times , let us look more closely at the interactions in the hamiltonian and how the qubits can be laid out so that each qubit only interacts with a set of qubits in its neighborhood .",
    "the precise form of this neighborhood is irrelevant , we only require that the interaction hyper - graph of this hamiltonian spatially sparse , as defined in the introduction .    given the lay - out of the computational ( non - clock ) qubits in figure [ fig : layout ] we can ` drape a string ' of clock qubits over the line following the sequence of computational steps .",
    "this ensures that the terms in @xmath98 involve qubits that are in each other s local neighborhood .",
    "we can also ensure this locality property of @xmath99 by choosing the output qubit @xmath94 to be the last qubit on the right in the final row .",
    "now let us consider @xmath96 .",
    "for every qubit in the layout in figure [ fig : layout ] there is a time in which the running cursor which snakes over the circuit first arrives at this qubit . for the qubits in @xmath69 ,",
    "this is when the cursor comes from the left doing the i operations or the non - trivial gate . for the qubits in the other rows @xmath100 ,",
    "it is when the cursor , coming from the right , starts swapping the qubit with the previous row @xmath101 .",
    "these cursor actions are represented in @xmath98 . for a qubit @xmath102",
    "we define the clock - qubit @xmath103 as the clock - qubit whose bit is flipped in the interaction representing the _ earliest _ gate ( the action of the cursor ) on the qubit @xmath102 in @xmath98 .",
    "then it is clear that the clock - qubit @xmath103 is local to the qubit @xmath102 and therefore @xmath96 again represents an interaction between qubits that are in each other s local neighborhood .",
    "it is also clear that the role of @xmath96 is to make sure that the state of the qubits is set to 0 before the gates actually act on these qubits .",
    "note that we set the state of all qubits ( except those in @xmath104 ) to zero , also the ones in the later rows that are merely used as dummy qubits to be used in swaps .",
    "this is not absolutely necessary but merely convenient .",
    "these arguments show that the interaction hypergraph of the hamiltonian is spatially sparse .",
    "note also that given a quantum circuit with @xmath63 qubits one can efficiently construct the interaction hypergraph of the corresponding hamiltonian and draw this hypergraph in the plane where hyperedges involving 5 qubits are represented as five - sided polygons .",

    "this implies that the ground - state of the 2-local hamiltonian should be approximately the ground - state of the desired 6-local hamiltonian and the gap for the 2-local hamiltonian is approximately the gap of the 6-local hamiltonian .",
    "this requires showing that the perturbative method that we employ does not only reproduce the lowest - eigenvalue but also the ground - state and the gap above the ground - state .",
    "2 .   one needs to verify that @xmath272 is of the form @xmath273 , with @xmath274 constant and @xmath275 .",

    "this implies that both the ground - state of the target hamiltonian as well as the gap above this ground - state can be generated perturbatively .",
    "since the total number of applications of the perturbation theory is constant , one can apply this argument for each step and thus show that the 6-local target hamiltonian can be effectively generated by a simulator hamiltonian @xmath276 .",
    "we now fulfill our second task , i.e. we show that @xmath277 , with @xmath274 constant and @xmath278 polynomially bounded .",
    "in @xcite such arguments were developed for the 3-to-2 local perturbation gadget and basically identical arguments can be given here .",
    "the original hamiltonian @xmath279 is at most linear in @xmath247 .",
    "if a gadget is applied on a term which is linear in @xmath247 , for example a 6-local term such @xmath280 , we obtain a new hamiltonian of which the terms are at most quadratic in @xmath247 .",
    "similarly each application of the perturbation gadgets takes a hamiltonian @xmath281 to another hamiltonian @xmath282 where @xmath283 .",
    "assuming that the norm of each @xmath284 is polynomial in @xmath5 and @xmath235 , then the norms of each @xmath285 are also @xmath239 . thus the final hamiltonian @xmath276 , obtained after a constant number of gadget applications , is indeed of the desired form .",
    "the drawback of the reductions performed by our perturbation theory method is that the 2-local hamiltonian that we construct has large variability in the norms of the 2-local terms . in other words ,",
    "2-local terms have constant norm whereas others can be fairly high degree polynomials in @xmath5 .",
    "such dependence on @xmath5 may be undesirable from a practical point of view , e.g. if one wants to perform universal adiabatic quantum computation .",
    "it is possible that a less stringent but still rigorous perturbation theory could be developed in which only the expectation values of _ local _ observables with respect to the ground - space are perturbatively generated .",
    "if such expectation values are reproduced with constant accuracy ( not scaling as @xmath286 ) , then the perturbation theory need not be accurately reproduce the entire ground - space as in lemma 3 . for adiabatic quantum computation",
    "this method would suffice since one can measure a single output qubit to extract the answer of the computation .",
    "one of the reasons why finding qma - complete problems is of interest is that it may give us a hint at what problems can be solved in bqp .",
