    "some of the most important questions to be addressed by forthcoming experiments in cosmology include testing models of the early universe and understanding whether einstein s general relativity is the correct theory for describing gravity . in both cases , the effects of possible deviations from the usually assumed ( and observationally motivated ) gaussian initial conditions in the early universe and the effects from relativistic corrections can be tested by measuring the clustering of matter on the largest scales observable .",
    "future surveys will go deeper ( e.g. the prime focus spectrograph , pfs  @xcite ) and wider ( e.g. the euclid satellite  @xcite ) , probing cosmological volumes around an order of magnitude larger than current ones and offering the possibility to observe the clustering of galaxies on scales comparable to the horizon scale , where both non - gaussian effects and relativistic corrections become important .",
    "this prospect requires a more accurate theoretical modeling on the largest scales . on these scales",
    ", we can no longer use the newtonian and flat - sky approximations ",
    "relativistic and geometric effects on large scales must be incorporated .",
    "the accurate modeling of large - scale matter clustering as traced by galaxies is the focus of this paper .",
    "the clustering of galaxies as a means to test cosmological models and constrain parameters has a long history .",

    "@xcite , the angle @xmath1 between galaxies goes to zero ( see figure  [ fig : triangle ] ) .",
    "this transverse flattening is also complemented by a flattening in the radial direction , i.e. the two galaxies are assumed to have the same average redshift .",
    "geometric corrections to the flat - sky approximation must break the transverse flattening , i.e. they must allow wide angles @xmath1  but they must also break the radial flattening , i.e. they must allow for large radial separation .",
    "wide - angle correlations have been investigated by @xcite , and this has been applied to survey data by @xcite . however , for large - volume and deep surveys we are also interested in significant radial ( redshift ) separations .",
    "the full 3d correlation function , allowing for large separations in the transverse and radial directions , was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects arise from the fact that we observe galaxies on the past lightcone and not on a constant - time surface .",
    "the galaxy number overdensity is gauge - dependent and we have to compute the physical , observed overdensity .",
    "this introduces redshift , lensing and volume distortions , including the standard lensing and redshift distortions but with additional terms that can become significant on horizon scales .",
    "the effects have been considered on the galaxy power spectrum  @xcite and on the 2-point correlation function  @xcite .",
    "the combination of relativistic effects and primordial non - gaussianity has also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "horizon scales are also where dark energy and modified gravity have the strongest impact on clustering , hence it is important to incorporate the relativistic effects for tests of modified gravity and dynamical dark energy  @xcite .",
    "the work presented here is based on  @xcite , which introduced a fully relativistic and 3d formalism that recovers and generalizes previous work in the newtonian flat - sky  @xcite , newtonian wide - angle  @xcite and relativistic flat - sky @xcite cases .",
    "we refer to the correlation function as the `` 3d correlation function '' .",
    "the operator that includes all the terms of the jacobian has been called the `` radial operator ''  @xcite or the `` spherical operator ''  @xcite .",
    "we point out here that the flat - sky limit suppresses the odd multipoles  a dipole and octupole  of the correlation function , and that these multipoles are potentially important for probing large - scale clustering .",
    "the full geometric effects should be combined with the relativistic effects for a consistent and accurate analysis .",
    "since non - gaussianity also grows on large scales , it is important to take relativistic and geometric effects into account , as we do here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : xi ] we briefly describe the formalism we use for modeling the large - scale correlation function while in section  [ sec : ngxi ] we discuss the modifications to the correlation function due to primordial non - gaussianity . in section  [ sec : multipoles ] we show that for the 3d case , additional odd multipoles are present in the correlation function compared to the flat - sky approximation . in section",

    "this constraint is unlikely to be improved upon by future cmb experiments , and so it is important to pursue large - scale galaxy surveys ( or 21 cm intensity mapping surveys  @xcite ) as the means to improve the constraint . since the local non - gaussianity is small , it is comparable to the relativistic effects in the observed clustering  @xcite , and thus these effects , together with geometric effects , should be incorporated in analysis of future survey data .",
