    "a major handicap in lookback studies of galaxy evolution is the inability to follow the evolution of any one galaxy over time .",
    "instead , we see only snapshots of the galaxy population at different epochs , and it is difficult to identify objects at one epoch with their precursors and descendants at different epochs .",
    "one of the most important tools to solve this problem is precision counts of galaxies , which can quantify the  flow \" of galaxies in parameter space as masses , morphologies , and stellar populations change .",
    "the luminosity function of galaxies was historically the first such tool , but the concept is rapidly being broadened to include counts as a function of mass , internal velocity , color , and other parameters .    a further difficulty is caused by the fact that nearly all functions known to date are _ unimodal _ and lack clear features that demarcate one class of galaxies from another . in other words ,",
    "galaxies tend to populate one big  cloud \" in most parameter spaces rather than separate clumps .",
    "this makes interpretation difficult , as sub - counts depend on how boundaries within these clouds are defined , and it is not clear whether ( or how ) these boundaries should be adjusted to follow galaxy evolution . as a result ,",
    "we often can not tell whether a change in the number of galaxies in any particular bin is due to a change in the overall number of galaxies or to the motion of galaxies in and out of that bin from neighboring bins .",
    "the latter problem is further exacerbated by the fact that samples are usually size- or brightness - limited and population numbers on the other side of these limits are not known . finally , uncertain errors can smear counts from one bin to another .",
    "all of these problems will be modeled when a full theory of galaxy formation is available to predict how galaxies evolve in in every measured parameter . in the meantime",
    ", it is hard to break the population into well motivated sub - populations , and we therefore lack the means to obtain more finely divided knowledge .    amidst this sea of unimodal functions , one function stands out on account of its uniquely bimodal character , namely , the color function .",
    "this is visible in the color - magnitude diagram , where early - type e / s0s populate a narrow red sequence that is separated from bluer , star - forming spirals by a shallow valley ( strateva et al .",
    "2001 ; hogg et al . 2003 ; balogh et al . 2004 ; baldry et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "a similar division extends to at least @xmath6 ( i m et al .",
    "2002 ; bell et al . 2004b ; weiner et al .",
    "2005 , willmer et al .",
    "2005 ) and possibly beyond ( giallongo et al .",
    "a bimodal distribution is also seen in other parameters such as spectral class ( madgwick et al . 2002 , 2003 ) and morphologies , metallicities , and star formation rates ( kauffmann et al . 2003a , b ) , but color is by far the easiest to measure .",
    "thus , not only does color sort galaxies cleanly into bins , it is also highly relevant to the emergence of the hubble sequence .",
    "however , to exploit this opportunity requires highly accurate counts , as the expected effects are not large .",
    "for example , counts of red galaxies in the combo-17 survey were seen to evolve by only a factor of a few since @xmath5 ( bell et al .",
    "even this small number has vital implications for galaxy formation ( see below ) , but confirming and improving the measurement clearly requires accuracies of order 10 - 20% .",
    "few previous measurements of distant luminosity functions have attained this accuracy .",
    "red galaxies are especially difficult because of their high clustering , which necessitates large samples over a large number of statistically uncorrelated regions .",
    "we are only just now coming to appreciate how formidable the problem of cosmic variance really is ( e.g. , somerville et al .",
    "2004 )    the present paper addresses these challenges by combining two large surveys , deep2 and combo-17 , to create the largest database yet analyzed of galaxies with @xmath7 0.8 , containing 39,000 galaxies in total , with 15,600 beyond @xmath8 .",
    "further checks are provided by pilot measurements from the deep1 survey .",
    "the entire sample is large enough and dispersed enough over the sky that cosmic variance and poisson fluctuations are reduced to 7 - 15% per redshift bin .",
    "the samples were selected and measured in different ways ",
    "deep2 redshifts are spectroscopic , while combo-17 s are photometric  and thus provide an important check on one another . finally , color bimodality is used to divide red galaxies from blue galaxies at all epochs .",
    "the red luminosity function is rederived and compared to the previous results of bell et al .",
    "( 2004b , hereafter b04 ) , while the blue function is presented in paper i and here for the first time ( in a sample of this size ) and offers a important foil for considering the behavior of the red function .",
    "deep2 data and combo-17 data are found to agree well in all major respects , and the principal conclusions appear to be robust .",
    "our most important result is to confirm the recent rise in the number of massive red galaxies _ at fixed stellar mass _ found by b04 .",
    "in contrast , the number density of massive blue galaxies has remained essentially constant since @xmath9 .",
    "a second important conclusion is that the characteristic @xmath10-band luminosity @xmath11 of both red and blue populations has dimmed by about the same factor : we find @xmath3 1.3 mag per unit redshift for both red and blue populations since @xmath5 .",
    "the rise in the number of massive red galaxies implies that most early - type galaxies assumed their final form at relatively late times , below @xmath1 , _ where the process can be studied in detail . _",
    "the late emergence of spheroidal galaxies disagrees with classic high - redshift , monolithic collapse models for spheroid formation but seems to be consistent with large amounts of other data , as reviewed in  6 .",
    "the remainder of this introduction reviews previous measurements of luminosity functions .",
    "the subject has a venerable history ( e.g. , binggeli et al .",
    "1988 ; tresse 1999 ; de lapparent et al .",
    "2003 ) , with determinations ranging from low to high redshift using field and cluster galaxies .",
    "accurate determinations of local field luminosity functions have finally become available from the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , norberg et al .",
    "2002 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , blanton et al . 2003",
    "; bell et al . 2003 ) , providing reliable local benchmarks against which evolution can be measured .",
    "the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on the internal properties of galaxies has been known since sandage , binggeli & tammann ( 1985 ) showed that the shape and magnitude of luminosity functions in the virgo cluster depend on galaxy morphology and luminosity class .",
    "this dependence on internal characteristics is also seen in local field galaxies when morphologies ( marzke , huchra & geller 1994 ; marzke et al .",
    "1998 ; marinoni et al .",

    "early studies of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function to @xmath12 1 used samples of a few hundred galaxies ( e.g. , cowie et al . 1996 ; brinchmann et al . 1998 ; lin et al .",

    "using the canada france redshift survey ( hereafter cfrs ) , lilly et al .",
    "( 1995b ) claimed that the evolution of the luminosity function is coupled to internal properties , being strongly correlated with color and , to a lesser extent , with luminosity .",
    "dividing red from blue galaxies using the median spectral type of the sample , the authors claimed a steepening in faint - end slope for blue galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath13 , while red galaxies showed little change in either luminosity or number density over the redshift range covered , @xmath14 .",
    "a conclusion that evolution depends on internal properties was also reached by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , based on a sample reaching to @xmath15 .",
    "[ oii ] fluxes were used to estimate star formation rates and @xmath16-band photometry to estimate stellar masses .",
    "they found that most of the luminosity evolution since 1 is due to blue galaxies with small masses but high star formation rates .",
    "more massive galaxies were relatively stable in numbers , particularly in the @xmath16-band , while the @xmath10-band showed modest number evolution .",
    "they concluded that the characteristic mass of galaxies undergoing intense star formation decreases over time , which they termed `` downsizing . ''",
    "cohen ( 2002 ) measured galaxies in a region centered on the hubble deep field and flanking fields and , in contrast to cfrs , found that the luminosity functions of several different spectral classes of galaxies showed no strong evidence of change in faint - end slope to @xmath0 , and further that the value of this slope is comparable to the local value .",
    "galaxies with spectra dominated by absorption lines at @xmath17 were brighter by @xmath31.5 magnitudes relative to local ones , while galaxies with strong [ oii ] brightened by @xmath30.75 magnitudes at @xmath0 .",

    "( 2004 ) studied the faint end of the luminosity functions of both red - selected galaxies and morphologically - selected early - type galaxies using acs images and photometric redshifts .",
    "the red - selected luminosity function was found to turn over steeply at faint magnitudes , whereas the morphologically selected sample was flat .",
    "the difference was attributed to blue spheroids , which filled in the counts at faint levels in the morphologically - selected sample .",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function as a function of color since @xmath12 1 was also investigated by pozzetti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who used the near - infrared - selected k20 survey of cimatti et al .",
    "( 2002b ) and divided the sample using the color of sa galaxies .",
    "they found a modest rise of at most 30% in the number of red galaxies after @xmath5 and concluded that most bright red galaxies were already in place by @xmath12 1.3 .",
    "the distant surveys just cited clearly disagree on many points , including the numbers of galaxies , shapes of luminosity functions , and degree of fading over time .",
    "however , these early surveys typically cover only a few tens of square arc minutes and in retrospect are seen to be subject to large cosmic variance ( see below ) .",
    "more recent surveys containing several thousands of galaxies are just now beginning to provide more robust measurements of the luminosity function . a large survey by ilbert et al .",
    "( 2004 , vvds ) using the vimos spectrograph on the eso very large telescope has measured the evolution of the total galaxy luminosity function to @xmath21 using a sample of @xmath311,000 galaxies to @xmath22 with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the authors find that @xmath11 for all galaxies has faded by 1.6 to 2.2 mag from @xmath23 to @xmath24 but that the number density of all galaxies has remained nearly constant .",
    "they also suggest a possible steepening in faint - end slope at @xmath17 .",
    "the deep2 survey ( davis et al . 2003 ) employs spectroscopic redshifts to measure distances and internal kinematics for @xmath340,000 galaxies in four regions of the sky . in order to probe galaxies at redshifts @xmath12 1 ,",
    "galaxies are pre - selected in three of the regions to have @xmath25 using @xmath26 colors .",
    "the luminosity function analysis for the first third of the deep2 survey is presented in a companion paper to this one by willmer et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter paper i ) , which uses @xmath27 color bimodality to study how the luminosity functions of blue and red galaxies change with redshift .",
    "the results show significantly fewer blue galaxies with time at fixed absolute magnitude , which is well modeled by a fading in @xmath2 together with roughly constant number density .",
    "counts for red galaxies , in contrast , show little change at fixed absolute magnitude and , when fitted with schechter functions , show a similar fading in @xmath11 with time but a formally significant rise in number density .    an alternative strategy to create large samples of galaxies",
    "is the use of photometric redshifts . in spite of lower precision ,",
    "photometric redshifts yield a larger number of redshifts per unit telescope time and enable distances to be measured for galaxies that are too faint for spectroscopy .",

    "2001 ; bolzonella et al .",
    "2002 ) and ground - based data ( e.g. , fried et al . 2001 ; drory et al . 2003 ; wolf et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter w03 ; chen et al . 2003 ; gabasch et al .",
    "2004 ) . of the photometric redshift surveys , the ones most comparable to the present work are combo-17 ( w03 ) and the fors deep field ( gabasch et al .",
    "2004 , fdf ) .",
    "the latter used a sample of more than 5,500 galaxies down to @xmath28 to measure the total restrame @xmath10-band luminosity function from @xmath29 to @xmath30  4 .",
    "like deep2 and vvds , they found a constant number of galaxies back in time but did not find a steepening of faint - end slope despite the fact that their sample goes ten times fainter than vvds .",

    "2001 , w03 ) contains @xmath328,000 galaxies . aside from the use of photometric redshifts",
    ", it is similar to the deep2 survey in terms of depth and coverage .",
    "the first luminosity - function analysis of combo-17 by w03 divided the sample into bins of fixed spectral type that did not evolve with redshift .",
    "some of the evolutionary trends that were discovered may have reflected color evolution between these fixed spectral bins rather than changes in overall numbers .",
    "the approach was changed in a follow - up analysis using the same database by bell et al .",
    "( 2004b , b04 ) , who used an evolving color cut based on bimodality to study red galaxies only . as noted earlier , this work obtained the important new result that red galaxies were not only brighter in the past ( by @xmath311 mag ) but were also fewer in number , by at least a factor of two at @xmath5 .",
    "this claim based on counts was buttressed by a separate argument based on the luminosity density of bright galaxies .",
    "this quantity , @xmath32 , can be measured more accurately than either @xmath33 or number density alone and was found to hold roughly constant since @xmath0 .",
    "since stellar population models predict a _ fading _ of red stellar populations by 12 mag between @xmath1 and now ( see  5 ) , the total stellar mass bound up in ( bright ) red galaxies must be _ increasing _ by about the same factor , providing additional evidence for growth in the red galaxy population since that time .",
    "a specific evolutionary scenario proposed by b04 had the majority of present - day massive e / s0s moving onto the red sequence after @xmath0 .",
    "the stellar populations of such galaxies would age passively once galaxies were on the red sequence , but individual galaxies would continue to increase their stellar masses via mergers along the sequence , as predicted by the hierarchical model of galaxy formation .    aside from b04",
    ", few works have used color bimodality to measure the luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies separately .",
    "one of those that has is by giallongo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who used a mixture of deep and shallow data in four fields containing 1,434 galaxies .",
    "dividing galaxies both by @xmath34 color and by star - formation rate , they found that color bimodality persists to @xmath35 but that the number density of red galaxies drops steeply beyond @xmath1 .",
    "they do not give numbers for @xmath1 specifically , which makes quantitative comparison with our results difficult , but our conclusions below agree at least qualitatively with theirs .",
    "the foregoing summary illustrates that information on distant luminosity functions is still fragmentary and often contradictory . in particular , the claim by bell et al .",
    "( 2004b ) for the emergence of red galaxies after @xmath5 has not yet been checked .",
    "a major impediment is cosmic variance  many of the above samples , especially the early and/or deepest ones , cover only a few tens of square arc min , for which the rms cosmic variance is @xmath350% per @xmath36 at @xmath1 , being even greater for red galaxies ( somerville et al .",
    "since number - density evolution by factors of two or three is at issue ( b04 ) , definitive results can not be obtained using such small areas , and larger samples are needed .",
    "deep2 and combo-17 fill that need ; each sample is large enough on its own to give statistically meaningful results , thus providing significant checks on one another .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 presents the data , which include not only combo-17 ( w03 ) and deep2 ( paper i ) but also data from the smaller deep1 pilot survey , which are presented here for the first time .  3 briefly summarizes methods used to measure the luminosity functions and their evolution , referring the reader to paper i and w03 for more details .",
    "readers wanting results quickly can skip directly to  4 , which presents the luminosity functions , computes values of @xmath11 , number density , and @xmath32 from fitting to schechter functions , and compares the answers to local and distant values from the literature .",
    "these are our core results on evolution .",
    "a detailed discussion of possible sources of error is presented in  5 , which can also be skipped on first reading .",
    "the implications for galaxy formation , especially of red galaxies , are discussed in  6 , which draws heavily on the properties of local e / s0s as well as distant ones .",
    "we ultimately favor a stepwise ,  mixed \" scenario in which ( massive ) e / s0s are quenched during a final gas - rich merger event , migrate to the red sequence , and then undergo a small number of further , purely - stellar mergers on the red sequence to attain their final masses .",
    "this scenario is similar to the one outlined by b04 and seems to have the right mixture of ingredients to explain the boxy - disky  structure sequence \" of local ellipticals plus the narrow e / s0 scaling relations and the age-@xmath37 anti - correlation that underlies them .",

    "the completeness of successful redshifts depends on galaxy rest - frame color , and simulated completeness maps are shown in w03 and w04 .",

    "this claim can be tested by identifying likely red - sequence galaxies from an apparent color - magnitude diagram like that in figure 1@xmath62 . in combo-17 , galaxies with failed redshifts occupy solely the region of blue galaxies .",

    "the two data sets thus complement each other well at high @xmath80 , making a parallel , head - to - head analysis extremely useful .",

    "i , this model should provide an adequate description for blue galaxies .",
    "the second model to treat failed redshifts is the `` average '' model , which assumes that failed redshifts have the same distribution as the successful redshifts in the same color - color - magnitude bin ; this is a reasonable assumption for red galaxies .",
    "the difference in weights between the minimal and average models is usually @xmath7425% ( average weights are higher ) , and most of the large differences occur for galaxies with extreme colors at faint magnitudes .",
    "luminosity functions calculated with the average model are slightly higher than those using the minimal model , by an amount that averages 10 - 20% .",
    "when the combined all - galaxy sample is considered , we use an `` optimal '' model in which red galaxies are modeled using the average model and blue galaxies are modeled using the minimal model .",
    "two small alterations to this general scheme were applied . in the case of egs in deep2 , a final correction ( described in paper",
    "i ) was applied to account for the different sampling strategy used in this field , which includes low - redshift galaxies but de - weights them so that they do not dominate the sample . in the case of deep1 ,",
    "the weights were modified to use additional size information from hst images , which show that _ all _ galaxies with angular half - light radius @xmath96 arc sec ( from gim2d ) lie within the legal redshift range @xmath97 .",

    "( 2004b , b04 ) , which offered the first analysis of evolution in @xmath4 and @xmath2 for red galaxies , based on combo-17 .",
    "the main finding was that @xmath2 for red galaxies dims over time by @xmath31.5 mag from @xmath1 to 0 and that @xmath4 _ rises _ by at least a factor of two .",
    "this evidence for evolution from the luminosity function was further bolstered by consideration of the total @xmath10-band luminosity density of red galaxies , @xmath32 , which is measured with smaller ( formal ) errors than @xmath93 or @xmath4 separately .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 was found to hold nearly constant since @xmath1 .",
    "since models of stellar evolution for red galaxies predict a rise in @xmath10-band stellar mass - to - light ratio by 1 - 2 mag since @xmath1 ( see more on this below ) , constant @xmath32 implies that the total stellar mass contained in red galaxies has at least doubled since @xmath1 , providing further evidence for significant growth and change in red galaxies over this epoch .",
    "bell et al.s finding of recent strong evolution among red galaxies disagrees with the classic scenario for red - galaxy formation in which e / s0 galaxies assembled their mass and formed stars very early and have been passively fading ever since ( e.g. , eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ; larson 1975 ) .",
    "the monolithic - collapse picture predicts constant @xmath4 accompanied by equal dimming in both @xmath2 and @xmath32 , but neither of these trends was seen by b04 . checking these conclusions by remeasuring these quantities with both deep2 and combo-17 was therefore a major goal of the present study .",
    "the bottom row of figure 6 presents the new data for red galaxies .",
    "as before , deep2 and combo-17 agree well .",
    "the most striking impression is the relative _ lack _ of evolution in the red luminosity function , especially when compared to the large shift to brighter magnitudes seen in the blue function .",
    "what evolution there is is quantified below by schechter fits , which are shown in figure 6 as the black lines .",
    "these fits indicate a formal dimming of @xmath11 over time , accompanied by a rise in number density , @xmath4 .",
    "the sense of these shifts is such that the data translate _ nearly parallel _ to themselves , leaving the raw counts at a fixed absolute magnitude relatively constant . since the actual counts are not changing a great deal , to first order , the fitted values of @xmath11 and @xmath4 must depend on slight curvature signals in the data , which could be weak and unreliable .",
    "we return to this question below , where the relative constancy of the red counts is considered from various points of view .",
    "for now we simply note that both the raw data and the fitted schechter function parameters from deep2 and combo-17 agree extremely well , and that the _ formal _ values of @xmath4 from both data sets agree with the rise found by b04 .",
    "another important result in figure 6 is the marked _ turnover _ in the slope of the red luminosity function at the faint end .",
    "this turnover is well established in both deep2 and combo-17 at intermediate redshifts and is seen by cross et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and by giallongo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at even higher redshifts .",
    "however , deep2 and combo-17 may disagree with one another in the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath112 - 0.4 ) , where the number of faint red galaxies continues to turn over according to deep2 but flattens according to combo-17 .",
    "this is noteworthy as only the potential discrepancy between deep2 and combo-17 , but the error bars on cobmo-17 are large , reflecting large field - to - field variations .",
    "other data sets have also yielded conflicting values for the nearby red faint - end slope .",
    "for example , by identifying early - type galaxies in sdss using both concentration and color , bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found only a modest turnover at the faint end , as in combo-17 , whereas madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identified red galaxies spectroscopically in 2df and found a strong turnover , more like deep2 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the question of the red faint - end slope and its possible evolution with redshift is very important for understanding the processes that created red - sequence galaxies .",
    "we return to this question in  5 below when discussing errors in the schechter function parameters caused by possible evolution in the red faint - end slope versus redshift .",
    "in passing , we note the grey triangles in figure 6 , which show luminosity functions from deep1 .",
    "these agree rather well with the functions from deep2 and combo-17 except in bin @xmath113 , where total deep1/red is a factor of 1.5 too high .",
    "two `` walls '' due to large - scale structure appear in that redshift bin , one at @xmath114 0.81 and a larger one at @xmath114 0.98 ( le fvre et al .",
    "1994 ; koo et al . 1996",
    "; see also figure 7 ) . however , the observed fluctuation is not much larger than the expected cosmic variance limits ( @xmath330% ) .",
    "this section presents the results of fitting schechter functions to deep2 and combo-17 using the sty method . aside from the possible low - redshift flattening of the red function in combo-17 , we see no variations in faint - end slopes that are statistically significant in different redshift bins , motivating the use of constant values of @xmath91 obtained from averaging over several bins .",
    "( in fact , small changes are expected in the shape of the all galaxy function with redshift because the shapes of the red and blue functions differ and their relative numbers are changing with redshift ; however , this effect is small . )",
    "we decided to average the faint - end slope values found within the range @xmath115 to 0.6 for combo-17 ( because of its larger number of galaxies in this redshift range ) , which yielded @xmath116 for the red sample and @xmath117 for the all and blue samples ( these values were also used for deep2 in paper i ) .",

    "as noted , we have refrained from drawing any strong conclusions about faint - end slope evolution from our data , despite the fact that deep2 and combo-17 have many more galaxies and go 1.5 magnitudes deeper than cfrs .",
    "in retrospect , the cfrs data do not look strong enough to support that claim . for red galaxies ,",
    "cfrs found no evolution in either @xmath2 or @xmath4 , whereas we find a dimming of @xmath2 by @xmath1361 mag and a rise in @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath34 ( since @xmath1 ) .",
    "part of the difference may be that , lacking knowledge of color bimodality , cfrs used a non - evolving color cut that did not quite hit the valley at high redshift .",
    "regardless , cfrs projected a picture in which red galaxies have been rather static since @xmath17 , while blue galaxies have significantly changed .",
    "the picture derived in this paper is that blue galaxies are rather constant in number ( though fading ) over this time interval , while red galaxies are actively being generated .",
    "the general impression in cfrs of active blue galaxies versus passive red galaxies is thus essentially opposite to what we find .",
    "luminosity density provides an estimate of the total amount of light emitted by galaxies per unit volume . the luminosity density ( in johnson @xmath10 band ) in this work is obtained assuming the schechter form of the luminosity function : @xmath137 where @xmath32 is calculated in solar units using @xmath138=5.48 ( binney & merrifield 1998 ) and @xmath139 is the gamma function .",
    "use of this expression entails extrapolation over faint magnitudes that are not observed , the more so at high redshifts .",
    "however , fitting a given bright - end data set assuming different values of @xmath91 tends to leave the product @xmath140 unchanged , which means that most of the uncertainty comes from @xmath139 .",

    "1996 ) is also plotted in figure 8 and shows a much steeper decline in @xmath32 after @xmath1 , like vvds .",

    "the conclusions are the same  the @xmath10-band luminosity density of red galaxies has remained essentially _ flat _ since @xmath146 and was possibly rising before that .",

    "despite the fact that only the upper part of the function is observed at @xmath0 , deep2 and combo-17 agree within 20% , and extrapolation errors must be small because the red function is known to turn over , even at high redshift ( cross et al .",

    "as noted , @xmath32 for bright red galaxies above @xmath165 is nearly constant out to @xmath129 , and may be lower before that .",
    "since stellar mass - to - light ratios are increasing with time , this means that the stellar mass bound up in red - sequence galaxies must also increase .",
    "but by how much ?",
    "b04 investigated this question using single - burst , passively evolving models , but these are only one option .",
    "we have investigated further possibilities such as @xmath166 models ,  frosting \" models with a continuing low level of star formation ( e.g. , gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ) , and  quenched \" models in which star formation is shut down abruptly at some epoch ( j. harker et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "models are set up to match the average color of red - sequence galaxies today and the relatively small amount of color evolution that is seen since @xmath1 ( @xmath167 mag ; bell et al .",
    "2004b , weiner et al .",
    "2005 , koo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "recipes that satisfy these constraints all yield fading in @xmath11 between 1 and 2 mag .",
    "observationally measured brightenings are consistent with these model estimates .",
    "the fundamental plane zeropoint brightens by 1 - 2 mag ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 , van dokkum & ellis 2003 , treu et al .",
    "2005a , b , van der wel et al . 2005 ) , the magnitude - radius zeropoint brightens by 1 - 1.6 mag ( trujillo & aguerri 2004 ; mcintosh et al . 2005 ) , and @xmath11 for red galaxies brightens by 1.3 mag ( this paper ) .",
    "these observational shifts do not necessarily represent the fading of stellar populations if galaxies are merging or otherwise evolving in radius or @xmath54 and changing their structure .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that the amount of evolution from the various scaling laws is very close to the evolution seen in @xmath165 , and this in turn is near the middle of the range predicted by the stellar population models . combining all results together , we adopt 1.0 mag ( 0.4 dex ) as the _ minimum _ increase in the mass - to - light ratio of a typical massive red galaxy since @xmath5 .",
    "since luminosity density @xmath32 has remained constant , this is also the minimum increase in red stellar mass over the same period .",
    "we collect together the following potential corrections to the above estimates of @xmath168 for e / s0 galaxies from @xmath5 to now .",
    "a positive sign means that the previously estimated rise in @xmath4 would be even bigger .",
    "the factors are : a possible mismatch between the adopted schechter function shape and the actual bright end of the luminosity function , + 0.10 dex ; a possible nearby flattening of @xmath91 from 0.5 to 1.0 , 0.18 dex ; and contamination by distant non - e / s0s , + 0.06 dex .",
    "each effect is small , two of the three are hypothetical , and collectively they tend to cancel . for these reasons , we do not apply any corrections to the above - measured rise in @xmath4 , namely , 0.36 dex since @xmath127 and 0.56 dex since @xmath5 .",
    "we have not thus far uncovered any  smoking gun \" as to why our counts of red galaxies in deep2 or combo-17 should be seriously in error .",
    "nevertheless , there is a worrisome feature of the data , and that is the fact that the two surveys , deep2 and combo-17 , do not show much _ internal _ evolution in @xmath4 over most of their well - measured range .",
    "this point was mentioned in paper i in connection with deep2 , and it is visible again in figure 7 , which plots both deep2 and combo-17 . in both data sets , there is a jump in @xmath4 of @xmath169 dex from the distant surveys to the local surveys , and another jump of @xmath170 dex between @xmath146 and @xmath130 . in between , @xmath4 tends to plateau .",
    "this stagnation is illustrated another way in figure 9 , which overplots @xmath92 data points from the lowest bin at @xmath171 from both surveys on top of the data points for distant bins .",
    "as previously noted , the red counts at bright magnitudes tend to translate _",
    "parallel _ to themselves , and one might even conclude that _ no evolution _ in the luminosity function , and thus in number density , has occurred .",
    "both deep2 and combo-17 are similar in this regard .",
    "this degeneracy could be broken by having fainter data , but our two surveys do not go deep enough to permit this .    at this point , the argument involving stellar mass - to - light - ratios assumes great importance .",
    "imagine replotting figure 9 versus",
    "_ stellar mass _ instead of @xmath99 . to account for the evolution in mass - to - light ratio , based on the discussion immediately above",
    ", the counts at @xmath0 would have to be shifted over to the right by at least 1 mag , which would produce a vertical offset with respect to the low - redshift counts by about a factor of four ( 0.6 dex ) near @xmath172 , where all curves superimpose .",
    "this is nearly identical to our previously measured fall - off of 0.56 dex based on @xmath4 .",
    "thus , once mass - to - light ratio evolution is allowed for , the number of massive red galaxies _ at fixed stellar mass _ is increasing about as fast as the formal fit for @xmath4 .",
    "this argument is very similar to the one applied by b04 to _ total _ luminosity density , but we apply it here to individual galaxy masses at the top end of the luminosity function .",
    "the distinction is a small one , but we wish to emphasize that the present version of the argument relies entirely on data that are observed .    in summary , the conclusion that the number density of red galaxies has risen significantly is supported by three pieces of evidence .",
    "one is the fitted results for @xmath4 , which yield formally significant values in number density that agree very well between deep2 and combo-17 .",
    "however , these may be suspect because of difficulties in comparing to local surveys and because both surveys may be prone to unknown errors at the far edge of their range .",
    "the next two arguments are therefore important and rest on the high probability that stellar mass - to - light ratios of red - sequence galaxies have evolved by at least one magnitude since @xmath5 .",
    "if so , the constancy of total luminosity density @xmath32 implies a rise in total red stellar mass by the same factor .",
    "finally , the constancy of the luminosity function itself ( at the bright end ) implies that a comparable growth in the number of massive red galaxies ( at fixed stellar mass ) must also have occurred . in what follows",
    ", we adopt the formal values of @xmath4 ( @xmath173 dex since @xmath127 and @xmath174 dex since @xmath175 ) as our measures of the rise in the number of red - sequence galaxies .",
    "the most interesting conclusion to emerge so far from the study of luminosity functions since @xmath5 is the growth in red galaxies _ over recent times_. we have argued that this translates to a similar , or even steeper , rise in the number of morphologically normal , spheroid - dominated e / s0s . barring mergers among a large and undiscovered population  which would have to be tiny and/or highly obscured to avoid detection in our and other surveys ",
    "this discovery means that the immediate precursors of most massive e / s0s _ must be visible in existing samples _ at @xmath5 and below .",
    "the implications of this were discussed by b04 .",
    "we build on their arguments by adding data on the blue luminosity function ( measured here by deep2 and combo-17 ) and the properties of local spheroidal galaxies , which we will argue also have strong implications for formation scenarios .",
    "our discussion focuses on _ typical _ red galaxies at high redshift since deep2 and combo-17 sample all galaxies regardless of location",
    ". the red sequence in distant clusters has also been extensively studied , but in general we do not try to fold these data into the present picture at this time .",
    "it is well established that residence on the red sequence requires that the star formation rate be quenched , or at least strongly reduced .",
    "stellar populations become red enough to join the red sequence just 1 - 2 gyr after star formation is stopped ( j. harker et al . , in prep . ) , but , in order for them to stay there , the star formation rate must remain low . for example , gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) explored a  frosting model \" with an early high rate of star formation , followed by a slowly decaying @xmath166 component .",
    "based on colors , they found that only 7% of total stellar mass could be formed in the @xmath166 component ; more recent limits based on o ii in distant red galaxies are even lower ( n. konidaris et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "in short , as b04 pointed out , the large build - up seen in red stellar mass after @xmath5 could not have arisen from star formation within red galaxies themselves .",
    "rather , the stellar mass at the bright end of the red sequence must have _ migrated _ there via one of three processes : 1 ) the quenching of blue galaxies , 2 ) the merging of less - luminous already - quenched red galaxies , or 3 ) some combination of the two . in the following discussion , we focus on the _ bright _ end of the red sequence because this is where the data are complete .",
    "galaxies may of course also be migrating to the lower end of the red sequence as well .",
    "it is helpful to visualize this mass migration as the movement of progenitor galaxies through the color - magnitude diagram or , more fundamentally , the color - mass diagram .",
    "sample tracks are shown in figure 10 .",
    "two parent regions are illustrated , a narrow red locus corresponding to the red sequence , and a broader blue clump , which we will call the  blue cloud . \"",
    "the rather constant morphology of the color - magnitude diagram since @xmath1 suggests that these parent regions are relatively stable in size and location . in reality",
    ", they are also moving as galaxies evolve , but this will not be too important if individual galaxies move through them more rapidly . with this assumption , we show the clumps as fixed and the galaxies as moving through them with time .",
    "each final galaxy today is represented by its most massive progenitor at any epoch .",
    "stellar mass is migrating toward the upper left corner , where luminous red galaxies reside . for a galaxy to get there",
    ", two things must happen : the stellar mass composing the final galaxy must be assembled via gravitational collapse , and star formation must be quenched .",
    "a key question in the formation of red - sequence galaxies is therefore _ when mass assembly occurred relative to star - formation quenching : _ that is , did quenching occur early in the process of mass build - up , midway , or late ?",
    "if extremely early , the pieces that would become the final galaxy migrated to the red sequence while still small , producing a large number of small galaxies on the lower red sequence that must later merge along the sequence in a series of  dry , \" purely stellar mergers .",
    "this is track a. if extremely late , the progenitors grew in mass hierarchically while still making stars within the blue cloud . upon quenching , the most massive of them moved to the head of the red sequence and took up residence there without any further dry mergers whatsoever .",
    "this late - stage quenching scenario ( for various masses ) is shown as the tracks labeled b in figure 10 .",
    "mixed scenarios are also possible , involving moderate mass assembly during the star - forming stage , followed by quenching and continued but limited dry merging along the red sequence .",
    "these are the tracks labeled c.    the tracks in figure 10 assume that quenching is accompanied ( and perhaps triggered ) by a major merger .",
    "a related but different scenario would involve the pure fading of _ single _ blue galaxies without any merging at all .",
    "we do not consider this , for two reasons given by b04 .",
    "first , distant blue galaxies are disk - dominated ( bell et al .",
    "2004b , weiner et al .",
    "2005 ) , and fading alone can not transform disks into spheroids  changing the structural morphology requires a merger .",
    "second , there do not seem to be enough blue galaxies in the distant color - magnitude diagram with masses comparable to those of massive red galaxies ( b04 ; weiner et al .",
    "2005 ; paper i ) .",
    "hence , in order to boost mass and to create spheroids , a final episode involving both quenching _ and _ merging seems to be required , at least for galaxies on the upper red sequence .",
    "on the other hand , quenching of pure disks without merging may well feed the _",
    "lower _ red sequence .",
    "indeed , the local red sequence contains many low - luminosity s0s ( binggeli et al .",
    "1988 ) whose disks were probably quenched by ram - pressure stripping or other gas - starvation processes not involving merging . because our focus here is on",
    "_ massive _ red galaxies , which lack disks , a final episode of quenching plus merging is assumed .",
    "yet a third process by which galaxies might migrate to the red sequence is _ unveiling , _ whereby a dusty starburst is cleansed of its interstellar medium and the underlying galaxy is revealed .",
    "such a process might cause the galaxy to brighten as dust absorption is removed , but also to redden as the starburst ages .",
    "however , there is no need to discuss this case separately because it is already subsumed under the above cases . if the starburst is an episode in the life of a single disk galaxy ( e.g. , hammer et al .",
    "2005 ) , then the object today is a late - type spiral and is irrelevant to the red sequence . if the starburst has been induced by a merger , then the dusty phase is a temporary stage between the original blue precursor and the final red remnant , which does not alter our fundamental model of blue galaxies merging and turning into red galaxies .",
    "the arrows in figure 10 are meant to connect initial and final states , not represent the detailed track whereby an object moves from blue to red .",
    "the only assumption that we have made concerning that transition is that merger remnants move quickly to the red sequence without lingering very long as bright blue starbursts .",
    "this is required by the fact that few if any bright blue starbursts are visible in the cm diagram ( bell et al .",
    "2004b ; weiner et al .",
    "2005 ; paper i ) .",
    "it is also supported by radiative transfer models of dust in merging galaxies , which indicate that the burst itself is heavily cloaked by dust and is optically nearly invisible ( jonsson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "thus , starbursting galaxies are hard to tell optically from non - starbursting galaxies , and both types populate the blue cloud , as we assume .",
    "the above assembly processes could be represented equally well by tracks in the color - magnitude diagram as in the color - mass diagram , and the former would be closer to existing data . however , mass is the more fundamental parameter , its behavior under merging is easier to predict than light ( because dust and starbursts are not a problem ) , and mass estimates for samples of distant galaxies are growing and soon will be a standard tool ( e.g. , drory et al .",
    "2004 , fontana et al .",
    "2004 , drory et al .",
    "2005 , bundy et al .",
    "with mass as the size variable , the motions of galaxies moving onto the red sequence are described by vectors moving both upward ( redder ) and to the left ( more massive ) .",
    "the slopes of the vectors in figure 10 correspond to equal - mass mergers ( i.e. , mass doubling ) ; unequal mergers would have more vertical vectors .",
    "yet another perturbation to the model is the possibility that the most - massive progenitor might take up residence on the red sequence and then later merge with a smaller gas - rich galaxy .",
    "the resultant starburst could briefly move the remnant back to the blue cloud , followed by subsequent decay back onto the red sequence ( e.g. , .",
    "charlot & silk 1994 )",
    ". however , such events ( while they last ) would create massive blue galaxies , which we have argued are rare .",
    "the events must therefore be short - lived and should not greatly distort our basic assumption that , once the most - massive progenitor galaxy enters the red sequence , the galaxy remains there permanently .",
    "we make three generic points before considering tracks a , b , and c further .",
    "first , since the number of massive spheroidal galaxies ( and their associated stellar mass ) has been growing over time , the makeup of the population is not stable , and mean properties such as average color , stellar age , etc .",
    ", are constantly being skewed by recent arrivals ( the so - called  progenitor bias \" phenomenon of van dokkum & franx ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "the population as a whole therefore can not be modeled using classic , single - burst , monolithic - collapse models ( e.g. , eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 , larson 1975 ) , even though certain properties , such as @xmath176 and color evolution , seem to be well fit by such models  this similarity is a coincidence and these models must be abandoned .",
    "a related point pertains to what we mean by the  age \" of a galaxy . in the monolithic picture",
    ", the age of spheroidal galaxies corresponds to the epoch at which the mass collapsed and the stars were formed ( both were the same ) . in the new picture ,",
    "each spheroidal galaxy has at least _",
    "three _ characteristic ages  the epoch of major mass - assembly , the epoch of major star formation , and the epoch of quenching",
    " all of which can be different .",
    "the final point is the importance of _ local _ e / s0s in constraining formation models .",
    "four local properties are relevant .",
    "the first is the basic fact that morphology correlates closely with average stellar age disk stars are younger and blue , whereas spheroidal populations are older and red ( e.g. , baade & gaposchkin 1963 ) .",
    "this fundamental datum motivates our basic assumption that the _ same _ process quenching star - formation also altered the morphology from disk - like to spheroidal .",
    "this process is believed to involve mergers with other similar - sized galaxies ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; toomre 1977 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "many local merger remnants are known whose properties are consistent with their evolving into spheroidal galaxies once the acute merger phase is over ( e.g. , schweizer 1982 , schweizer 1986 , hibbard 1995 ) .",
    "the incidence of spheroid - dominated galaxies is also higher in groups and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , dressler 1980 , postman & geller 1984 , hogg et al .",
    "2003 , balogh et al .",
    "2004 , baldry et al .",
    "2004 ) , where mergers were more frequent .",
    "second , local e / s0 galaxies populate a rather tight  fundamental plane \" linking radius , luminosity , and velocity dispersion ( faber et al .",
    "1987 , dressler et al .",
    "1987 , djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "the tightness of this plane implies that stellar mass - to - light ratio can not scatter by more than @xmath12515% at any point on the plane .",
    "two other relations , the color - magnitude relation ( faber 1973 , sandage & visvanathan 1978 , bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ) and the mg-@xmath54 relation ( e.g. , bender , burstein & faber 1992 , bernardi et al .",
    "1998 , colless et al . 1999 ,",
    "worthey and collobert 2003 ) , are also quite narrow and further link the properties of stellar populations to those of their parent galaxies .",
    "third , the mean light - weighted stellar - population ages of local es scatter widely , from over 10 gyr down to just a few gyr ( e.g. , gonzalez 1993 , trager et al . 2000a , jrgensen 1999 , terlevich & forbes 2002 ) , with most being younger than classic single - burst models would predict ( 11.4 gyr if @xmath177 ) .",
    "this large number of young ages allows room for the late quenching that is required by the luminosity function data . on the other hand",
    ", there is at most a weak trend in stellar age with mass or @xmath54 _ along _ the red sequence ( trager et al .",
    "2001 , terlevich & forbes 2002 , bernardi et al .",
    "2005 ) , so that stellar ages and metallicities scatter substantially at every point on all three relations . to keep the relations tight , worthey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) posited that an _ anti_-correlation must exist between age and metallicity at constant mass and/or @xmath54 , as later verified by jrgensen ( 1999 ) , trager et al .",
    "( 2000b ) , and bernardi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the fourth and final point is that nearby es populate a _ structure sequence _ , in which small objects rotate strongly , are flattened by rotation , and have disky isophotes and steep central surface - brightness profiles , whereas massive objects rotate weakly , are flattened by anisotropic velocity dispersions , and have boxy isophotes and core - type central profiles ( e.g. , davies et al .",
    "1983 , bender , burstein & faber 1992 , faber et al . 1997 ) .",
    "at the low - mass end , these properties connect smoothly with s0s and , through them , to the remainder of the hubble sequence ( kormendy & bender 1996 ) .",
    "several authors have suggested that this structure sequence can be explained broadly by assuming that small spheroidals were produced via mergers of gas - rich ,  wet \" progenitors , while more massive spheroidals were produced by progressively ",
    "dry , \" purely stellar mergers of smaller spheroidals ( e.g. , bender , burstein & faber 1992 , kormendy & bender 1996 , faber et al .",
    "this scenario implies that the most massive of today s spheroidals were created mainly by purely stellar mergers .    with these points as background ,",
    "we return to the tracks in figure 10 . the early - quenching scenario ( track a ) has most of its mass - assembly occurring in dry mergers _ along _ the red sequence .",
    "this can be ruled out on two grounds .",
    "first , to produce the large amount of stellar mass bound up in massive red - sequence galaxies would require a huge reservoir of small , faint galaxies on the lower red sequence .",
    "this excess is not detected at any redshift  the local red - sequence luminosity function is at most flat ( @xmath178 ) and if anything turns over more steeply at higher redshifts ( cross et al . , 2004 , kodama et al .",
    "2004 , giallongo et al .",
    "2005 , figure 6 here ) .",
    "the required reservoir of small red galaxies therefore does not exist .",
    "second , building up massive red galaxies from purely dry mergers along the red sequence would yield stellar populations whose metallicities are uncorrelated with stellar age and whose ages and metallicities would converge to a single value at high masses after many mergers had occurred .",
    "this fails to match the fundamental plane , color - magnitude , and mg-@xmath54 relations , which indicate that age and @xmath37 must be _ anti_-correlated at each location , nor does it match the strong spread in age and @xmath37 that exists even among massive galaxies ( trager et al .",
    "2001 , terlevich & forbes 2002 ) .",
    "( the upward tilt that we have placed on the arrow representing dry mergers on track a reflects the probable increase in mean stellar age during dry merging , not an increase in mean metallicity . )",
    "the late - quenching scenario ( track b ) is extreme in the opposite sense of having _ no _ dry merging at all along the red sequence . in this picture ,",
    "massive present - day spheroidals were formed via a single merger of two very massive _ gas - rich _ progenitors .",
    "the main reason for ruling out this scenario is the structure sequence among local es , which , as noted , implies that massive es were formed by dry , gas - poor mergers .",
    "the signatures of such mergers are distinctive because the precursors are dynamically hot , yielding fuzzy tidal tails without sharp boundaries ; many examples of such dry mergers can be seen in local catalogues ( e.g. , arp 1966 ) , so it is clear that they are occurring .",
    "the mixed scenario ( track c ) involves early mass assembly and star formation , followed by quenching and further ( but limited ) dry merging .",
    "this scenario seems most naturally to explain the properties of local e / s0s .",
    "for example , the final mergers making small spheroidals would be mostly gas - rich , while later mergers along the red sequence would be progressively more gas - poor , as required by the structure sequence .",
    "furthermore , the break point between boxy and disky galaxies is an upper limit on the masses of blue galaxies that have migrated onto the red sequence recently .",
    "that break point today is in the range @xmath179 = 20 to 21 , where boxy and disky galaxies coexist ( faber et al .",
    "1997 , lauer et al . in progress ) . with mean spheroidal @xmath180 6 ( from gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 , adjusted to the @xmath10-band and @xmath181 ) , this translates to stellar masses in the range 1 - 2@xmath182 m@xmath183 , or blue progenitor masses of 0.5 - 1@xmath182 m@xmath183 for equal - mass mergers .",
    "these are at the upper end of blue masses today ( bell et al .",
    "2003 ) , as expected .    with one more quite natural assumption",
    ", the mixed scenario might even be able to explain the narrowness of the local fundamental plane , color - magnitude relation , and mg-@xmath54 relations .",
    "consider a selection of galaxies at a fixed mass today on the red sequence . in the mixed scenario ,",
    "these galaxies will have arrived there via different routes  some will have been produced by recent gas - rich mergers of two blue galaxies , while others will have quenched earlier and evolved along the red sequence via dry mergers for a longer time . in general , however , we expect there to be a broad correlation between the mass of a spheroidal galaxy today and the mass of its latest blue progenitor , massive spheroidals tending to come from more massive blue galaxies , and vice versa .",
    "this  memory \" of progenitor mass then helps to shape the final metallicity of a galaxy via the mass - metallicity relation among star - forming galaxies .",
    "this relation is strong among nearby galaxies ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) and apparently extended well into the past to beyond @xmath5 ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "if the amount of dry merging on the red sequence is limited , the original mass - metallicity relation of the progenitors will survive to form the _",
    "backbone _ of the red - sequence scaling relations seen today . on the other hand",
    ", this backbone will be blurred by the different star - formation histories of galaxies  galaxies that quenched early from low - mass blue progenitors and grew later via dry mergers will have rather low metallicities ( reflecting their small progenitors ) , but their average stellar age will be high ( since multiple dry mergers take time ) .",
    "in contrast , galaxies that quenched late and arrived on the red sequence near their present mass will have higher metallicities ( reflecting more massive progenitors ) , but their average stellar ages will be younger because they quenched recently .",
    "thus , the _ multiplicity of routes _ that is inherent in the mixed scenario might help to account naturally for the _ anti_-correlation between age and metallicity that is needed to explain the scaling relations .",
    "however , the more dry merging that takes place along the red sequence , the more the underlying mass - metallicity correlation of the blue progenitors will be erased , to be replaced by age scatter .",
    "the amount of scatter in age and @xmath37 at fixed mass is therefore an indicator of the amount of dry merging that could have occurred , which might be determined through observations and modeling .",
    "this section briefly discusses quenching and the related concept of  downsizing . \"",
    "to be effective , quenching requires the removal of essentially all cold gas within galaxies , and the prevention of any more falling in .",
    "the key question is what triggers quenching : why and when does it happen ?",
    "several processes are probably involved .",
    "we adopt as a starting point the standard view that mergers of gas - rich galaxies can trigger powerful starbursts ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . one major source of gas removal is therefore consumption of gas in the starburst itself .",
    "the burst also generates internal stellar - driven feedback that can remove and/or heat gas , such as photoionization , o - star winds , supernovae , and radiation - driven winds operating on dust ( murray , quataert & thompson 2005 ) .",
    "an additional source of gas - heating is orbital energy injected during the merger , which can drive gas out in a galactic wind ( cox et al .",
    "gas can also be removed by external processes such as ram - pressure stripping , tidal stripping , and  harassment \" ( moore et al . 1996 ) , which operate more effectively in the dense environments frequented by spheroidal galaxies .    despite this abundance of potential gas - removal mechanisms , it has been suggested that these alone may not be adequate to keep spheroidal galaxies gas - freee  the energy requirements seem too large , and gas in models continues to fall in , creating large numbers of massive blue galaxies that are not seen , especially at the centers of clusters ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "for example , to match the sharp turndown at high masses in the galaxy mass function , kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found it necessary in semi - analytic models to truncate gas cooling arbitrarily in all halos above a circular velocity of @xmath184 km s@xmath185 .",
    "similar ad hoc recipes are being tested in smaller halos in order to see if they can produce color bimodality ( e.g. , r. somerville et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "considerable evidence , both theoretical and empirical , suggests that feedback from agns might be the missing trigger for quenching ( e.g. , granato et al .",
    "2004 ; dekel & birnboim 2005 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) , which is plausible since spheroids are precisely those galaxies that possess massive black holes ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , magorrian et al . 1998 , tremaine et al . 2002 ) .    properties of local spheroids may shed further light on quenching .",
    "a major clue , as mentioned , is that local galaxies scatter significantly in age at any location on the red sequence , which suggests that galaxies of the same mass have arrived there via different routes and different quenching histories .",
    "it is also observed that red galaxies _ co - exist _ with blue galaxies over more than one order of magnitude in total stellar mass  a cross - over point exists near @xmath186 m@xmath183 where the numbers of red and blue galaxies are equal ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a , b ) , but the transition is gradual ( bell et al . 2003 ) . both of these facts suggest that the trigger for quenching is _ not _ simply total stellar mass or any variable closely related to it ( such as luminosity or rotation speed ) because any of those would produce a division in mass between spheroidals and non - spheroidals that is too abrupt .",
    "rather , we seek one ( or more ) variables that are broadly related to total mass but with considerable scatter , and perhaps also having some relation to the presence and size of the central black hole , given the possible need for agn feedback .",
    "a natural variable satisfying these requirements is _ stellar spheroid mass _ , which increases generally with total galaxy mass but scatters greatly with respect to it .",
    "spheroid mass is also closely linked to the mass of the central black hole ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , hring & rix 2004 ) , and thus perhaps its energy output .",
    "finally , spheroid mass increases discontinuously during a major merger , and its rise over some threshold might be the specific trigger for quenching .",
    "this scenario would meet the requirements of balogh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who concluded that the blue - to - red transition must be driven primarily by internal properties rather than by environment . but",
    "environment could play a smaller role and , through its variation from galaxy to galaxy , contribute to the scatter seen in stellar ages at each point on the scaling relations .    as a final topic",
    ", we consider the matter of  downsizing . \"",
    "the basic concept of downsizing was introduced by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to explain their finding that actively star - forming galaxies at low redshift are smaller in mass than actively star - forming galaxies at high redshift , which suggested that star formation is stronger at late times in smaller galaxies than large ones .",
    "the essence of this idea was already latent in the literature .",
    "for example , it was known that early - type galaxies are more luminous and more massive than later - type galaxies ( de vaucouleurs 1977 , binggeli & sandage 1985 ) and that their stellar populations are on average older ( e.g. , tinsley 1968 , searle , sargent & bagnuolo 1973 ) . color and gas fraction were known to vary systematically along the hubble sequence ( de vaucouleurs 1977 ; roberts 1969 ) , indicating progressively slower , less - efficient star formation in later hubble types .",
    "finally , the blue end of the hubble sequence had been shown explicitly to be a mass sequence ( van den bergh 1976 , de vaucouleurs 1977 ) , with low - mass irr is at the bottom having the smallest fraction of stars and the highest proportion of gas ( roberts 1969 ) .",
    "all evidence together thus indicated ( even then ) that massive galaxies made most of their stars early , whereas small galaxies formed theirs relatively later .",
    "recent analyses of the star - forming histories of both local galaxies from sdss ( heavens et al .",
    "2004 ) and distant galaxies from the gemini deep deep survey ( juneau et al .",
    "2005 ) have confirmed this basic picture .",
    "blumenthal et al . ( 1984 ) offered a reason for this mass - dependent sequence by suggesting that early - type galaxies arose from higher-@xmath54 galaxy - sized perturbations in a cold - dark - matter universe .",
    "such perturbations would collapse first and start making stars early .",
    "moreover , because of the non - white nature of the cdm power spectrum , high-@xmath54 perturbations of galaxy mass are embedded preferentially within larger high-@xmath54 perturbations ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) , which causes them to merge more and eventually wind up in groups and clusters .",
    "the accelerated growth of high-@xmath54 perturbations was demonstrated in early hydrodynamical simulations by cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) , which showed the first galaxies collapsing at the intersections of filaments , forming stars rapidly , and assembling later into groups and clusters .",
    "they identified these early - forming objects with e / s0s.(all ) , to remain constant since @xmath1 , despite the fact that halos are continuing to merge .",
    "the larger point is that events on the scale of galaxies are becoming progressively more decoupled from events on the scale of halos , including the processes of star formation and baryonic mass assembly ( see also heavens et al . 2004 ) .",
    "but the influence of parent halos ( what is often termed  environment \" ) has not yet declined to zero even now .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) and related statistics ( see review by cooray & sheth 2002 ) are emerging as powerful tools for unravelling the relationship between galaxies and their dark - matter halos , which is crucial to understanding galaxy formation . ]",
    "the above concept of downsizing refers to the _ mean epoch of star formation _ , which was clearly earlier in massive galaxies than smaller ones .",
    "however , as noted , spheroidal galaxies have a second star - formation timescale , namely , that of _ quenching_. these two timescales might vary differently with mass , thereby generating ( in principle ) two different kinds of downsizing ( or even _ up_sizing ) . when speaking of downsizing , it is important to clarify which timescale is meant .",
    "the remainder of this discussion focuses on the down(or up)sizing of _ quenching _ , asking whether the typical entry mass onto the red sequence has increased or decreased with time .",
    "this amounts to asking whether it is easier ( or harder ) to keep galaxies of a given stellar mass free of cold gas at late epochs .",
    "three factors suggest that keeping galaxies gas - free should get easier with time .",
    "first , gaseous infall generally declines with time in the universe , and gas within galaxies gets converted to stars ; both of these mean that there is less gas overall that needs to be removed or fended off .",
    "second , galaxies cluster more and move more rapidly within clusters , both of which promote environmentally - driven gas - removal processes such as stripping and harassment .",
    "third , parent dark - matter halos have higher dynamical temperatures and lower densities so that any leftover gas outside galaxies is hotter and less likely to cool .",
    "the sum of these factors suggests that it is easier to keep galaxies of a given mass gas - free at late times .",
    "when this is coupled with the observed fact ( not yet fully explained ) that quenched galaxies are larger , we are led to hypothesize that the typical entry mass onto the red sequence may be _ decreasing _ with time , such that progressively smaller galaxies can find their way onto the red sequence at later epochs .",
    "we have already mentioned certain observations that point in this direction , including the deficit of small red - sequence galaxies at high redshift ( kodama et al .",
    "2004 , cross et al . , 2004 ,",
    "giallongo et al . 2005 ) followed by possible later infill ( e.g. , bell et al .",
    "2003 ; combo-17 here ) , the late arrival of small spheroids on the fundamental plane ( treu et al .",
    "2005a , b ) , the more rapid evolution back in time of the surface - brightness of smaller spheroids ( mcintosh et al . 2005 ) , the more rapid evolution back in time of the fundamental plane zeropoint for smaller galaxies ( van der wel et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the possible decrease with time in the crossover mass between spheroids and disk galaxies ( bundy et al .",
    "2005 ) . in aggregate",
    ", the evidence may be pointing to a downsizing of quenching , on top of the downsizing of star formation in galaxies as a whole .",
    "the finding that the majority of spheroidal stellar mass was quenched only after @xmath1 amounts to a paradigm shift with wide repercussions over a range of issues in galaxy formation .",
    "this section lists some important questions that are raised by the late - quenching picture .",
    "first , does the increase of mass on the red sequence cause a problem for the observed mass budget of blue galaxies ?",
    "no , because the increase in red stellar mass is small in absolute terms .",
    "red - sequence galaxies today make up 20% of the total number of bright galaxies , and 40% of the total stellar mass ( hogg et al .",
    "if their stellar has roughly tripled since @xmath1 , it would have increased from 0.13 units to its present level of 0.40 units .",
    "if this increase came at the expense of blue galaxies , their stellar mass would have declined from 0.87 units to 0.60 units , a fall of only 0.16 dex that if translated to @xmath4 would be barely detectable in figure 7 .",
    "thus , even this extreme scenario in which all new stellar mass in red galaxies came _ entirely _ from the pre - existing stellar mass of blue galaxies is probably consistent with the data .",
    "but it is more likely that much of the new red stellar mass was born via continuing star - formation in blues after @xmath5 , and also in final merger - generated starbursts .",
    "for example , it has been claimed that 50% of all star formation at @xmath5 is occurring in intermediate - mass lirgs , many of which are mergers and could be the precursors of spheroidal galaxies ( hammer et al . 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "total stellar mass in all types of galaxies has also probably increased since @xmath5 , by between 1.4 and 2.0 ( fontana et al .",
    "2004 ; rudnick et al . 2003 ; drory et al . 2005",
    "; but see also bundy et al .",
    "either of these increases would be large enough to maintain blue @xmath4 approximately constant if the new stellar mass were appropriately distributed over red and blue galaxies .",
    "thus , the observed constancy of blue number density in the face of rising numbers of red galaxies does not seem to be a problem .",
    "a second point is how galaxy mass functions are predicted to evolve if the present luminosity function data are correct .",
    "we have already noted that the measured evolution in @xmath11 for red galaxies is similar to the predicted change in their stellar @xmath187 ratio .",
    "if these evolutions are identical , the characteristic mass @xmath188 for red galaxies has remained constant .",
    "the same rough equality probably also holds for blue galaxies .",
    "but , since red galaxies are more massive than blue ones , their rise in number density should cause the mass function to go up faster at higher masses , and thus the mass function should change shape .",
    "this does not appear to agree with published measurements , which show a more even rise over all masses ( drory et al .",
    "2005 ) , or perhaps even no rise at all ( bundy et al .",
    "on the other hand , existing mass functions are measured over small areas and are subject to large cosmic variance .",
    "larger samples coming soon from deep2 ( k. bundy et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and vvds may resolve this discrepancy .",
    "a third issue is reconciling the rise in red - sequence galaxies with the rate of mergers needed to create them .",
    "estimated merger rates for bright galaxies going back to @xmath9 vary widely in the literature ( see lin et al . 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "early merger rates from deep2 are based on optical pair counts , not morphologies , and are rather low : only 9% of @xmath33 galaxies are estimated to have suffered a major merger since @xmath189 ( lin et al .",
    "2004 ) ; bundy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) obtain similar rates based on k - band pair counts . in the present scenario , merged galaxies",
    "are assumed to migrate rapidly to the red sequence . if red galaxies have tripled in number since @xmath1 and make up 20% of all galaxies today ( hogg et al .",
    "2002 ) , then 2/3 of all red ones  and thus 13% of all galaxies  must have merged since @xmath1 .",
    "this fraction 13% is not far from the deep2 merger fraction of 9% , and also does not allow for additional quenching that may have occured without mergers , such as in stripped s0s . in short ,",
    "the required rate of conversion by mergers is not excessive and may even be consistent with the rather low deep2 rate .",
    "higher merger rates could also be accommodated provided that the extra remnants wind up as the bulges of spiral galaxies , as is generally assumed in semi - analytic models ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1996 , baugh , cole & frenk 1996 , somerville & primack 2001 ) and suggested by hammer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on the observed frequency of lirgs .    a further puzzle that may now need rethinking is the existence of non - solar abundance ratios in early - type galaxies , which display enhanced ratios of snae type ii elements compared to elements generated in type ia s ( e.g. , worthey et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the amount of enhancement correlates closely with velocity dispersion ( kuntschner 1998 , trager et al .",
    "it has been customary to account for these non - solar ratios by appealing to very rapid star formation , which suppresses the iron - peak elements that are produced more slowly by type ia s .",
    "such early - burst scenarios were natural within the monolithic - collapse picture . however , if most massive ellipticals were quenched at or after @xmath5 , they were probably making stars for at least several gyr before that , and rapid - burst models may no longer apply .",
    "perhaps a correlation existed among the _ precursors _ of red galaxies between @xmath54 and average star - formation duration that is strong enough to explain the data . alternatively , other factors such as galactic wind strength or imf variations ( see trager et al .",
    "2000b ) might play a role .",
    "finally , further work is needed to understand the form and scatter of the fundamental plane , mg-@xmath54 relation , and red - sequence ( color - magnitude ) scaling relations .",
    "as noted , scatter about these relations places strong limits on the amount of stellar merging , which may prove problematic .",
    "the tilt of the red sequence is also a mystery : it could come from the underlying mass - metallicity relation of the blue progenitors or from aging during a long series of stellar mergers  both possibilities have been mentioned here . in short ,",
    "the scaling relations are sensitive diagnostics .",
    "we might have attempted simple estimates of their form and scatter here , but semi - analytic models seem a much better vehicle for such calculations , and we defer these to later papers .    besides posing difficult questions , the late - quenching picture also opens up new opportunities .",
    "if red galaxies indeed emerged recently , it becomes feasible to study in detail why certain galaxies turn red .",
    "for example , we can look at the galaxy population just beyond @xmath5 and try to predict which galaxies are about to be quenched . given the close correspondence between red galaxies and dense environments , it is natural to ask whether galaxies turn red owing to an increase in the amount of clustering around them , or whether pre - existing dense environments suddenly begin to  spawn \" red galaxies near @xmath5 .",
    "two studies within deep2 are underway to answer this question ( b. gerke et al .",
    ", in prep . ;",
    "m. cooper et al . , in prep . ) , both taking advantage of deep2 s high redshift accuracy , which provides the needed information on parent groups and clusters .    an important issue going well beyond the confines of this paper is the impact that the late - quenching picture will have on the relation between spheroids and black holes .",
    "the masses of present - day black holes correlate closely with the properties of their parent spheroids , whether with total luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 , hring & rix 2004 ) or with velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "as long as spheroids were thought to form early , it was possible to imagine that the relationship is ancient , with roots going back to @xmath190 when spheroids and black holes were simultaneously forming ( e.g. , richstone et al .",
    "however , if most spheroids emerged late , the relation could hardly have existed before @xmath9 , and the massive black holes that were growing before that time must somehow have  known \" which spheroids they would eventually wind up in .",
    "thus , the late - emergence of spheroids adds an important new twist to the black - hole / galaxy co - evolution story .",
    "although we have clearly come down in favor of the late - quenching picture , the conclusion is more indirect than we would like , resting heavily as it does on models for the evolution of stellar mass - to - light ratios",
    ". the subject would be on much firmer footing if further checks could be carried out .",
    "for example , it remains to be shown whether @xmath16-band counts and redshift distributions of near - ir - selected samples are consistent with the large drop in red galaxies at @xmath9 claimed here .",
    "these counts should be reconsidered using fainter samples with photometric redshifts , and quenched rather than monolithic - collapse models .",
    "furthermore , if the red counts could be extended just 1.5 magnitudes fainter , @xmath4 could be measured directly at @xmath1 . for definitive results ,",
    "however , such data would have to cover @xmath32  spaced over the sky in several statistically uncorrelated regions .",
    "a related question is whether the emergence of spheroidal galaxies near @xmath5 is consistent with the properties of red objects earlier than this .",
    "some studies have searched for red objects beyond @xmath23 ( e.g. , van dokkum , et al .",
    "2003 ; franx et al .",
    "2003 ) , while others have targeted red objects near @xmath191 ( e.g. , cimatti 2002a ) .",
    "the results are very different .",
    "objects beyond @xmath23 contain old stars but are still star - forming vigorously ; they are red in part because they are dusty ( frster schreiber et al .",
    "2004 ; van dokkum et al . 2004",
    "; toft 2005 ) .",
    "although they may be future red - sequence galaxies , their numbers do not bear on the question of whether many galaxies quenched later near @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the number of red galaxies near @xmath191 is very relevant . despite the fact that a large fraction of these objects are also dusty ( e.g. , moustakas et al .",
    "2004 ) , a sizeable fraction also seem to be fully quenched ( longhetti et al . 2005 , daddi et al .",
    "2005 , saracco et al .",
    "number densities have been variously estimated between 10% ( daddi et al .",
    "2005 ) and 100% ( saracco et al . 2005 ) of local massive spheroidals , leading different authors to conclude that massive es are , or are not , fully quenched by @xmath5",
    ". however , such surveys are as yet small and are subject to large cosmic variance .",
    "extending this work to larger areas ( and distingushing dusty galaxies from quenched ones ) would provide the sharpest test of the late - quenching model .",
    "the evolution of @xmath10-band galaxy luminosity functions since @xmath0 is determined using a total sample of 39,000 galaxies to @xmath107 mag from the deep2 and combo-17 surveys .",
    "deep2 data come from willmer et al .",
    "( 2005 , paper i ) , while the combo-17 data come originally from wolf et al .",
    "( 2003 ) but have been substantially reworked using using improved photo - z s and new color classes .",
    "evolution is examined for blue and red samples separately by dividing galaxies using color bimodality ; this is the first study aside from willmer ( 2005 ) to compare blue and red galaxies in this way .",
    "cosmic variance is reduced to 7 - 15% per redshift bin by combining the results of the surveys .",
    "deep2 counts agree remarkably well with combo-17 in all color classes at nearly all redshifts .",
    "luminosity functions of blue and red galaxies evolve differently with redshift ; the blue counts shift to brighter magnitudes at fixed number density back in time , whereas red counts are nearly constant at fixed absolute magnitude .",
    "both deep2 and combo-17 agree in this regard .",
    "schechter function parameters are fit to the data assuming non - changing shape ( constant @xmath91 ) , and results are compared to recent measurements from other distant surveys .",
    "good agreement is found between deep2 and combo-17 at all redshifts , and between these and other large , recent surveys counting all galaxies . results by color are not yet available from these other surveys .    combining the distant schechter parameters with local ones , we solve for the fading over time of characteristic luminosity @xmath2 for all , red , and blue galaxies .",
    "all classes fade by nearly the same amount , showing fadings ( per unit redshift ) of 1.30@xmath192 mag for red galaxies , 1.31@xmath193 mag for blue galaxies , and 1.37@xmath194 mag for all galaxies .",
    "in contrast to @xmath11 , @xmath4 evolves differently in different color classes : formal values for @xmath4 hold steady for blue galaxies but rise for red galaxies by 0.36 dex@xmath1250.09 dex since @xmath127 , and by 0.56@xmath1250.09 dex since @xmath5 .",
    "the evolution of luminosity density , @xmath32 , also differs with color ; for blue galaxies it falls by 0.4 dex after @xmath0 , while for red galaxies it remains constant since @xmath129 , possibly being smaller before that .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these results is that the number density of blue galaxies has remained nearly constant since @xmath5 , whereas the number density of red galaxies has increased .",
    "the latter conclusion is subjected to close scrutiny , which is warranted by the fact that _ most _ of the total red evolution ( in both deep2 and combo-17 ) occurs between the local surveys and our data , and in the farthest bin of our data ",
    ", in the two places where the data are weakest .",
    "although it is possible that our formal values of @xmath4 may have unknown errors , we nevertheless conclude that substantial evolution in the number density of red galaxies _ has _ occurred , based on strong evidence for a rise of at least one magnitude in the mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath187 ) of red stellar populations since @xmath5 .",
    "when this rise is taken into account , the observed near - constancy of red luminosity density translates to a rise in overall number density by at least one magnitude .",
    "a similar argument applied to the red counts at fixed absolute magnitude translates to a rise in number _ at fixed stellar mass _ that is also comparable to the formal rise from @xmath4 .",
    "thus , both the new deep2 data and the reanalysis of combo-17 together strongly support the rise in red galaxies since @xmath0 first found in combo-17 by bell et al .",

    "/ s0 galaxies must be visible in existing surveys near @xmath5 .",
    "the lateness of the rise is inconsistent with classic , high - redshift single - burst collapse models for e / s0 formation , which predict constant numbers of spheroidal galaxies over this epoch .",
    "instead , it appears that most present - day e / s0s arose from blue galaxies with ongoing star formation that were  quenched \" at or after @xmath0 and then migrated to the red sequence .",
    "the properties of nearby e / s0 galaxies support a  mixed \" scenario in which quenched galaxies enter the red sequence over a wide range of masses via  wet , \" gas - rich mergers , followed by a limited number of  dry , \" stellar mergers along the sequence .",
    "the most massive e / s0s are built up during the last stages of dry merging and are visible today as boxy , core - dominated ellipticals .",
    "some evidence points to a decline in the average entry - mass onto the red sequence with time , which would amount to a  downsizing \" of quenching .",
    "this and other processes might change the shape of the red luminosity function , violating our assumption throughout of constant @xmath91 , but the changes are not large enough to invalidate our major conclusions .",
    "furthermore , galaxies at a given mass on the red sequence will have arrived there via different merging and star - formation histories .",
    "plausible differences among these histories may account for the _ anti_-correlation that is seen between age and metallicity residuals on the red sequence and that is needed to account for the narrowness of the fundamental plane , mg-@xmath54 , and color - magnitude relations of local e / s0s .",
    "finally , growing evidence seems to suggest that extra feedback from agn activity might be a key ingredient in initiating quenching .",
    "consistent with this is the fact that quenched stellar populations and massive central black holes are both uniquely associated with spheroidal galaxies .",
