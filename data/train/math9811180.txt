    "in this paper we consider a fundamental domain defined by maskit in @xcite for the action of the teichmller modular group on the teichmller space of a closed surface of genus @xmath2 in the special case of genus @xmath5 .",
    "mccarthy and papadopoulos  @xcite have also defined such a fundamental domain , modelled on a dirichlet region ; for punctured surfaces there is the celebrated cell decomposition and associated fundamental domain due to penner  @xcite . for genus",
    "@xmath5 semmler  @xcite has defined a fundamental domain based on locating the shortest dividing geodesic . also for low signature surfaces the reader",
    "is referred to the papers of keen  @xcite and of maskit @xcite ,  @xcite .    throughout @xmath1",
    "will denote a closed orientable surface of genus @xmath5 , with some fixed hyperbolic metric .",
    "we say that a simple closed geodesic @xmath7 on @xmath1 is : _ dividing _ if @xmath8 has two components ; or _ non - dividing _ if @xmath8 has one component . by _ non - dividing geodesic _ we shall always mean simple closed non - dividing geodesic .",
    "we denote the length of @xmath7 with respect to the hyperbolic metric on @xmath1 by @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the number of intersection points of two distinct geodesics @xmath11 .",
    "we define a _ chain _ @xmath12 to be an ordered set of non - dividing geodesics such that : @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "we say that a chain @xmath16 has _",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "likewise we define a _ bracelet _ @xmath19 to be an ordered set of non - dividing geodesics such that : @xmath13 for @xmath20 and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "again we say that @xmath21 has _ length _",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath22 .",
    "following maskit , we call a bracelet of length 6 a _",
    "necklace_.    for @xmath23 a chain of length @xmath17 can be always be extended to a chain of length @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    "this extension is unique .",
    "likewise a chain of length 5 extends uniquely to a necklace .",
    "so chains of length 4 or 5 and necklaces can be considered equivalent .",
    "we shall usually work with length 4 chains , which we call _ standard_. ( maskit , for genus @xmath26 , usually works with chains of length 2g+1 , which he calls standard . )    as maskit shows in @xcite each surface , standard chain pair @xmath27 gives a canonical choice of generators for the fuchsian group @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and hence a point in @xmath30 , the set of discrete faithful representations of @xmath31 into @xmath32 .",
    "essentially this representation corresponds to the fundamental domain @xmath6 together with orientations for its side pairing elements .",
    "as maskit observes , it is well known that @xmath30 is real analytically equivalent to teichmller space .",
    "so , we define the _ teichmller space _ of closed orientable genus @xmath5 surfaces @xmath33 to be the set of pairs @xmath27 .",
    "we say that a standard chain @xmath34 is _ minimal _ if for any chain @xmath35 we have @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "we then define the _ maskit domain _",
    "@xmath38 to be the set of surface , standard chain pairs @xmath27 with @xmath39 minimal .",
    "for @xmath39 to be minimal the geodesics @xmath40 must satisfy an a priori infinite set of length inequalities . for genus @xmath26 , maskit gives an algorithm using cut - and - paste to show that only a finite number @xmath41 of length inequalities need to be satisfied .",
    "applying his algorithm to genus @xmath5 , maskit showed that @xmath42 .",
    "we establish an independent proof that @xmath43 .",
    "we could have shown that 18 of maskit s 45 inequalities follow from the other 27 . however , by tayloring all our techniques to the special case of genus 2 , we are able to produce a much shorter proof .    the fact that 18 of maskit s 45 inequalities follow from the other 27 follows from applications of theorem  [ tri ] ( which appeared as theorem  1.1 in  @xcite ) and of corollary  [ angle corollary ] .",
    "the latter follows immediately from theorem  [ angle characterisation ] , for which we give a proof in this paper .",
    "this is a characterisation of the octahedral surface @xmath44 ( the well known genus two surface of maximal symmetry group ) in terms of a finite set of length inequalities .",
    "the 27 length inequalities have the properties that : each is realised on one or other of two special surfaces ( for all but @xmath45 this special surface is @xmath44 ) ; and each compares distances between weierstrass points in the fundamental domain @xmath6 for @xmath1 .",
    "the author would like to thank bill harvey , bernie maskit , peter buser , klaus - dieter semmler and christophe bavard for hospitality and helpful discussions .",
    "the author was supported for this work by the swiss national science foundation on a royal society exchange fellowship at epfl , lausanne , switzerland and is currently supported by the french government as a boursier on a sejour scientifique .",
    "it is well known that every closed genus two surface without boundary @xmath1 admits a uniquely determined _ hyperelliptic involution _ , an isometry of order two with six fixed points , which we denote by @xmath46 .",
    "the fixed points of @xmath46 are known as _",
    "weierstrass points_. every simple closed geodesic @xmath47 is setwise fixed by @xmath46 , and the restriction of @xmath46 to @xmath7 has no fixed points if @xmath7 is dividing and two fixed points if @xmath7 is non - dividing ( see haas  susskind  @xcite ) .",
    "so every non - dividing geodesic on @xmath1 passes through two weierstrass points .",
    "it is a simple consequence that sequential geodesics in a chain intersect at weierstrass points .",
    "we say that two non - dividing geodesics @xmath11 _ cross _ if @xmath48 and @xmath49 contains a point that is not a weierstrass point .    the quotient _ orbifold _",
    "@xmath50 is a sphere with six order two cone points , endowed with a fixed hyperbolic metric .",
    "each cone point on @xmath51 is the image of a weierstrass point under the projection @xmath52 and each non - dividing geodesic on @xmath1 projects to a simple geodesic between distinct cone points on @xmath51  what we shall call an _",
    "arc_. definitions of chains , bracelets and crossing all pass naturally to the quotient .",
    "let @xmath39 be a standard chain on @xmath1 , which extends to a necklace @xmath53 .",
    "we number weierstrass points on @xmath53 so that @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "choose an orientation upon @xmath1 and project to the quotient orbifold @xmath50  for the rest of the paper we shall work on the quotient orbifold @xmath51 .",

    "[ probably ]    the standard chain @xmath39 is minimal if the following are satisfied :    @xmath72    @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75    @xmath76 , @xmath77    @xmath78 .",
    "each length @xmath79 or @xmath80 ( respectively @xmath81 ) is a distance between cone points in @xmath60 ( respectively @xmath67 ) .",
    "likewise each length @xmath82 , @xmath83 is a distance between cone points in @xmath84 .",

    "the exceptional orbifold @xmath85 , which was constructed in @xcite , has conformal symmetry group @xmath86 .",
    "however it is not defined by the action of its symmetry group alone , it also requires a certain length inequality to be satisfied .",

    "making such a list for all the orbifolds in figure  [ fig : realise ] , together with their mirror images , we see that all the inequalities in therem  [ probably ] are realised as equalities on either @xmath44 or @xmath85 .",
