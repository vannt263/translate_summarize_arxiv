    "x - ray dipping consists of reductions in intensity that are generally at the orbital period due to absorbing material in a bulge in the outer accretion disk or in blobbiness in a stellar wind .",
    "dipping allows emission processes to be determined unambiguously since the requirement to fit non - dip plus several dip spectra , especially using high quality instruments on _ asca _ , _ rxte _ , _ bepposax _ , _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ , strongly contrains emission models .",
    "dipping provides information in 2 ways : via spectra and via ingress / egress times which can give the size of emission regions , and of particular interest is the size of accretion disk coronae ( adc ) where comptonization takes place .",
    "dipping is relatively common , and in the following , dipping is discussed in the black hole binary cygx-1 , in the galactic jet source groj1655 - 40 and in lmxb where @xmath210% of sources are dippers .",

    "the spectrum of this state is dominated by a hard component plus a weak blackbody identified with the disk , plus a reflection component . during dipping",
    ", spectral evolution can be described below 10 kev ( where reflection contributes little ) by an absorber which progressively covers the extended adc emission region with spectral model : ag*pcf*cpl where ag represents galactic absorption , pcf is the covering fraction and cpl is a cut - off power law to represent the comptonized emission .",
    "an investigation of the variation of dipping with orbital phase by bauciska - church et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , revealed that there is a smooth variation peaking at phase zero ( superior conjunction of the black hole ) as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) , plus a second peak at phase @xmath20.6 which is evidence for a stream from the companion .",
    "the smooth variation with phase was shown to follow the variation of column density in the stellar wind of hde226868 with phase , although this is difficult to calculate accurately because of several factors including the variation of ionization state in three - dimensional space as a function of distance from the black hole , and the suppression of wind acceleration by x - ray illumination ( blondin 1994 ) .",
    "the agreement indicates that dipping is due to blobs in the stellar wind .",
    "dip duration times can be used to determine blob sizes , giving @xmath3 cm ( kitamoto 1984 ) and from _ rosat _ ( see below ) @xmath4 @xmath5 cm , which combined with column densities in dipping gives blob densities @xmath6 @xmath7 , @xmath8 times more dense than in the wind , from which it follows that there is a low ionization state in the blobs and suggesting that recombination into the blobs in the x - ray shadow will cause blob growth .",
    "dipping allows the size of the comptonizing region to be measured under conditions when the angular size of the absorber is greater than the angular size of the largest emission region . in _ rosat _",
    "pspc observations ( bauciska - church & church 1999 ) , dipping was close to 100% deep indicating that this condition was met",
    ". then the dip ingress time @xmath9 , typically 510 s , depends on the diameter of the major source region , i.e. the adc .",
    "the velocity of absorbing blobs has a keplerian component of @xmath2400 km @xmath10 at the radius of the companion , plus additional wind velocity @xmath22100 km s@xmath11 ( herrero et al .",
    "thus the adc radius @xmath12 for an order of magnitude velocity of 2000 km s@xmath11 is given by @xmath13 , so that @xmath12 is @xmath14 @xmath15 cm .",
    "in recent years , values of the comptonization break energy @xmath16 in cygx-1 have become available , allowing constraints to be put on the electron temperature in the comptonizing region . from fig . 1 of dove et al .",
    "( 1997 ) a value of @xmath16 of @xmath2 230 kev can be derived .",
    "the cut - off energy must be between @xmath17 and 3@xmath17 for plasmas that are optically thin or optically thick to electron scattering respectively .",
    "particular comptonization models provide specific values of @xmath17 : e.g. @xmath17 = 150 kev , @xmath18 @xmath2 0.3 ( haardt et al . 1993 ) ; @xmath17 @xmath19 90 kev , @xmath18 @xmath2 1.5 ( dove et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we will assume that @xmath17 is between 77 and 230 kev and use these values to calculate the maximum radius of an adc in hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath20",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 , ( where @xmath24 is the proton mass ) , i.e.    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the adc electron temperature in @xmath27 k. from this it follows that the maximum hydrostatic adc radius is between 0.61.8@xmath28 cm for the range of @xmath17 above .",
    "thus the measured radius of the adc is much smaller than the hydrostatic value in contrast with adcs in lmxb discussed later .",
    "this implies strong differences between black hole and neutron star systems , presumably due to the effects of the neutron star in forming the adc .",
