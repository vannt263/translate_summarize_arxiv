    "black holes play a central role in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the original proposal of a large @xmath2 duality  @xcite was largely motivated by the successes of string theory in explaining the black hole entropy , and soon afterwards , it was realised  @xcite that the black hole geometries are directly related to thermal states in the gauge theory .",
    "this led to non - trivial predictions for the phase structure of the strongly - coupled gauge theory , and placed our understanding of string theory s successes in accounting for the black hole entropy on a much firmer footing .",
    "however , our understanding of the description of the black hole _ geometry _",
    "( as opposed to its thermodynamic properties ) from the dual field theory point of view remains very weak .",
    "it has proved difficult to address even the simplest questions about observations in a black hole spacetime from the field theory point of view .",
    "for example , we do not know how the ` one - way ' nature of the event horizon is ( approximately ) enforced in the field theory , nor do we know how to describe the observations of an observer falling across the black hole horizon .",
    "these difficulties reflect broader problems in understanding the lorentzian aspects of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the connection between thermodynamics of black holes and thermodynamics of gauge theory can be understood using the euclidean black hole solutions .",
    "but in this euclidean section , there is no region ` behind the event horizon ' : in positive definite signature there is in general no coordinate - independent notion of an event horizon .",
    "the usual analytic continuation back to lorentzian signature maps the euclidean section onto the region outside the event horizon of an eternal black hole .",
    "it has sometimes been suggested that this implies that the dual field theory describes only physics in the region outside the event horizon .",
    "however , as argued in  @xcite , this seems very unlikely : there is a cauchy surface for the black hole spacetime which lies entirely outside the event horizon .",
    "thus , if the dual field theory provides a complete description of the physics in this region , it will also determine what is happening behind the horizon .",
    "that is , degrees of freedom which pass behind the event horizon should still be encoded in the dual field theory in some way , which could involve some form of black hole complementarity  @xcite .",
    "attempts to explore this encoding were made in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", attention was focused on the description of black holes formed from collapse and on the geon , so the geometry has a single asymptotic boundary , and the full geometry including the region behind the horizon should be described by some appropriate state in the dual field theory .",
    "one obstacle to progress in these cases was that the correct state in the field theory is not easily identified . in  @xcite ,",
    "the eternal btz black hole was considered , and a dual description of the geometry in terms of a specific entangled state of the two cfts living on the two asymptotic boundaries of the spacetime was proposed ( building on previous work  @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a concrete context in which one can ask what information about the region behind the event horizon is contained in correlation functions of cft operators in this entangled state .",
    "it was argued in  @xcite that correlation functions involving operators in both cfts would indeed probe the region behind the horizon .    in  @xcite , substantial progress in implementing these ideas",
    "was achieved by introducing two key ingredients : first , the calculation of higher @xmath3-point correlators using bulk - boundary propagators was considered .",
    "this involves an interaction vertex which is integrated over the bulk , allowing the explicit identification of contributions from different regions of the spacetime .",
    "second , a novel analytic continuation was found , which relates the integration of the bulk interaction vertex over the euclidean black hole to an integration over the whole black hole spacetime , including the regions inside the black hole event horizon .",
    "this amplitude could also be analytically continued in the standard way , to obtain a representation in terms of an integral just over the region outside the black hole event horizon .",
    "( these alternative analytic continuations were also discussed in  @xcite . )",
    "this technique thus provides an explicit realisation of the ideas of black hole complementarity  @xcite .",
    "it shows that there is a representation in which the field theory treats the black hole singularity , and not the event horizon , as the end of the classical spacetime description .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend the analysis of  @xcite to consider the rotating btz black hole .",
    "this involves a generalisation of the analytic continuation described in  @xcite .",
    "we will see that the field theory calculation can only be related to an integral over the region outside the inner horizon of the black hole ; this suggests the region inside the inner horizon , where the singularities are visible , is unphysical from the field theory point of view .",
    "we proceed as in  @xcite , investigating the definition of correlation functions in the entangled cfts on the two asymptotic boundaries of the rotating black hole by analytic continuation from a euclidean solution . in the bulk description , a boundary correlation function",
    "is calculated by evaluating appropriate feynman diagrams constructed from bulk - boundary and bulk - bulk propagators , with the interaction vertices integrated over the bulk spacetime . as we analytically continue the boundary points from the euclidean to the lorentzian section",
    ", we must deform the contour of integration for these interaction vertices in some way .",
    "we will investigate two different ways of deforming this contour , which lead to different representations of the same lorentzian correlation function .",
    "in the first case , we deform in the usual way , taking the integration over the euclidean spacetime to be an integration over the regions outside the black hole event horizons .",
    "we then find a new ` kruskal - like ' coordinate system , which allows us to define a deformation of the contour as we analytically continue which can be interpreted as giving an integration of the interaction vertices over the whole region between the past and future cauchy horizons ( inner horizons ) , including both the regions between the inner and outer horizons and the exterior asymptotic regions .",
    "thus , in this case , the boundary correlation function can be related to an integral over the cauchy development of a cauchy surface connected to the asymptotic boundaries .",
    "there appears to be no representation in which the computation of boundary observables involves the spacetime region beyond the cauchy horizon .",
    "the field theory seems to see the cauchy horizon ( and not the event horizon ) as a natural boundary .",
    "this supports the argument given previously , that the region inside the event horizons must be described by the field theory because it is included in this cauchy development .",
    "there is another reason for expecting the spacetime to be cut off at the cauchy horizon : an observer who crosses it will see the naked timelike singularity inside the black hole , leading to a violation of strong cosmic censorship  @xcite . the fact that the cft only appears to describe the region outside the cauchy horizon may therefore be interpreted as an interesting manifestation of cosmic censorship in the ads / cft correspondence . it has previously been argued that violations of strong cosmic censorship in such charged black hole spacetimes are prevented by an instability of the cauchy horizon : it is a surface of infinite blueshift  @xcite , and is therefore unstable to generic perturbations of the exterior geometry  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if the fact that the cft sees the cauchy horizon as the end of the classical spacetime in rotating black holes is a reflection of this instability , or represents a truly independent mechanism for enforcing cosmic censorship .",
    "an important direction for future work is to look for signs of singular behaviour in the cft associated with the region of spacetime near cauchy horizons , and to understand the conjectured breakdown of the classical spacetime picture there .    in section  [ rot ] , we review the rotating btz black hole solution , and discuss the analytic continuation relating the euclidean and lorentzian solutions in the standard btz coordinate system  @xcite .",
    "this analytic continuation was also recently discussed in  @xcite , where the propagation of strings in this geometry was considered . in section",
    "[ disc ] , we introduce a new coordinate system , in which the analytic continuation relates the euclidean section to the regions outside the event horizon and between the event horizon and the cauchy horizon .",
    "our discussion follows that in  @xcite very closely .",
    "section  [ concl ] contains some concluding remarks and thoughts on future directions .",
    "we will begin by reviewing the relevant features of the btz solution , the propagators for scalar fields on this spacetime , and the analytic continuation to define a related spacetime with positive definite metric . in static coordinates ,",
    "the rotating btz solution of  @xcite is ( we are setting the ads length scale associated with the cosmological constant to one ) @xmath4 the parameters @xmath5 are related to the mass and angular momentum of the solution through @xmath6,\\ ] ] so @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "this solution is locally ads@xmath9 ; this is most easily seen by relating the coordinate system used in ( [ rbtz ] ) to the embedding coordinates @xmath10 for the ads@xmath9 hyperboloid , which satisfy @xmath11 .",

    "we adopt the same procedure as  @xcite , denoting the different regions by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the signs of the two combinations @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "the bulk description of a generic field theory amplitude involves connecting a truncated feynman diagram built from bulk - bulk propagators and vertices to the boundary points using these bulk - boundary propagators .",

    "if we start with the integration over the euclidean black hole , with the external source points taken to lie at @xmath91 , then the appropriate contour is from @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "the singularities in ( [ esing ] ) are then of the form imaginary @xmath94 real .",
    "that is , all the singularities associated with future ( resp .",
    "past ) lightlike separation are to the right ( left ) of our contour of integration .",
    "this will lead to a standard feynman @xmath95 prescription when we rotate back to lorentzian signature .",
    "note that this would not necessarily be the case if we tried to define the amplitude via an integration over imaginary @xmath96 at real @xmath46 .",
    "this thus shows the importance of the analytic continuation in @xmath46 from the point of view of this calculation .",
    "plane is pictured ; on the right , translation invariance has been employed to move the original contour of integration to @xmath97 . to simplify the figure , only singularities associated with an external point in region @xmath45 have been indicated . ]    since we rotate @xmath46 as well as @xmath53 in moving from the euclidean to the lorentzian section , it might seem that the motion of the singularities ( and hence the way we need to deform our contour ) is much more complicated in the present case than it was in the non - rotating case .",
    "in fact , it is nt . to follow the motion of the singularities , it is convenient to define a new variable @xmath98",
    ". then the locations of the singularities in the complex @xmath99 plane are given by @xmath100 + 2\\pi i m.\\ ] ] the only complication then is the behaviour of the third term .",
    "but while we want to continue from the euclidean section , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is real , to the lorentzian section , where @xmath46 and @xmath102 are real , we need not keep @xmath102 real at intermediate stages ; we can consider the analytic continuation along any path in the space of complex metrics that is convenient . clearly , it is more convenient to perform the analytic continuation by continuing @xmath103 and @xmath46 from imaginary to real values while keeping @xmath104 real at intermediate stages , rather than with @xmath102 kept real at intermediate stages .",
    "the effect of the analytic continuation will then be to rotate the singularities onto the real axis by changing the first two terms in ( [ esingz ] ) from imaginary to real values .",
    "the rotation moves all the singularities in a counter - clockwise direction , so if we similarly move the contour of integration in a counter - clockwise direction , deforming it as illustrated in figure  [ fig : def ] , we will obtain the usual feynman prescription for integrating over the singularities on the light - cone .",
    "thus , after analytic continuation , we can deform the contour of integration for the vertices to an integration over the real @xmath96 axis and @xmath105 , and over two vertical segments connecting the horizontal segments .",
    "since the singularities associated with external points in region @xmath45 will appear on the real axis , while those associated with external points in region @xmath106 will appear on the other horizontal segment , we interpret this as saying that bulk vertices are integrated over the two regions @xmath107 outside the black hole s event horizon .",
    "the vertical segments create appropriate correlations in the state on the past and future horizons on the two sides .",
    "this contour also gives us an @xmath95 prescription for the bulk - boundary propagators which goes above the past singularities and below the future ones on the real axis , and vice - versa along @xmath105 , so it reproduces the usual thermal propagator in the region outside the black hole on each side .",
    "the addition of non - zero angular momentum therefore does not introduce any conceptual novelty relative to the discussion for the non - rotating black hole for the calculation of field theory amplitudes using this deformation of the contour .",
    "we would like to relate this calculation of the correlator by an integration over the region outside the black hole to some integral which includes the region inside the black hole . to do so",
    ", we need to find a different way of deforming the contour integral as we perform the analytic continuation . as in  @xcite ,",
    "the key is to find an appropriate coordinate system .",
    "we want an analogue of the kruskal coordinate system used in  @xcite , but now adapted to the identification used to construct a rotating btz black hole .",
    "note that the kruskal coordinates introduced for the rotating black hole in  @xcite are not apt for our purpose , as there is no explicit expression for the metric as a function of the coordinates in that coordinate system .",
    "we can construct a coordinate system which will cover the same region of the spacetime , but in which the metric does have an explicit expression , by adopting a different perspective on the coordinate system used in  @xcite .",
    "there , the metric on the euclidean btz black hole was expressed as @xmath108,\\ ] ] where @xmath109 .",
    "this coordinate system is related to the embedding coordinates @xmath110 satisfying @xmath111 by @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 we can recognise this coordinate system as a cartesian version of the poincare disc coordinates on ( euclidean ) ads@xmath9 .",
    "that is , the surfaces @xmath115 constant in these coordinates are copies of the poincare disc , written in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath116 . if @xmath62 is unrestricted , this is a familiar description of global ads@xmath9 .",
    "the btz black hole is obtained by a quotient on hyperbolic space that is expressed in these coordinates as @xmath117 .",
    "now the difference between the ` rotating ' and non - rotating euclidean black holes is simply that in the former case , we make an identification with a twist ; that is , the identification which constructs the euclidean black hole is not orthogonal to the poincare discs in this coordinate system .",
    "a coordinate system adapted to such an identification can be created by twisting the above coordinates , i.e. , through @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 in these coordinates , the euclidean metric reads @xmath121.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this coordinate system is related to the embedding coordinates by @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 the identification @xmath126 in these coordinates gives us the rotating btz black hole .",

    "this similarity is perhaps more obvious in the inverse coordinate transformation , @xmath136 @xmath137 one would like to know what portion of the btz metric our rotating disc coordinates are covering .",
    "this is most easily analysed by following  @xcite , and considering the signs of the combinations @xmath35 and @xmath138 . in the coordinate system of  ( [ btzk ] ) , these are @xmath139 and @xmath140 we see that @xmath141 is always positive , so we have only regions with @xmath142 , while @xmath143 can be positive or negative , so we have regions with @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "exploring further , we have @xmath146 @xmath147 thus , we have the following : for @xmath148 , we have a region @xmath149 and a region @xmath150 .",
    "the surface @xmath151 maps to @xmath152 . for @xmath153",

    "the physical range of coordinates is thus @xmath160 , which covers the same region as btz kruskal coordinates @xmath161 @xcite , namely the region including the regions @xmath107 outside the horizon and @xmath162 between the two horizons in one ` copy ' of the btz black hole .",
    "just as the regions @xmath163 are not physically connected to the regions @xmath107 , even though they might appear to be adjacent in these coordinates , the @xmath164 are not connected to the regions @xmath162 in the physical spacetime ( region @xmath165 intervenes ) .",

    "this reflected the fact that as we approach the btz singularity , the proper distance between different images of the bulk point in the covering space is going to zero ( as is obvious from the fact that @xmath172 is vanishing there ) . for non - zero rotation",

    "this was already seen in btz coordinates in ( [ lorpch ] ) .",
    "this is physically correct ; in the non - rotating case , @xmath173 is the btz singularity , and as was pointed out in  @xcite , the btz singularity is like the singularity in the parabolic orbifold of flat space studied in  @xcite .",
    "the divergence in the summation in the propagator near the btz singularity is thus related to the instability of this singularity identified in  @xcite ( where multiple boosted images of a single particle converge ) . in the rotating black hole , by contrast , @xmath172 does not vanish at @xmath174 , so the proper distance between images remains finite at @xmath175 ; this is just a horizon in the spacetime . as discussed in the introduction",
    ", we nevertheless expect that there will be a singularity there , due to the infinite blueshift associated with this horizon , so the cutoff at the event horizon is not just an artifact of our coordinate system .",
    "the curvature singularity that forms at the cauchy horizon is a weak , null singularity ( which is characterised by having finite tidal deformations )  @xcite . as a result",
    "the singularity is neither associated with the sum over images or the divergence of the probe field .",
    "hence , we should not expect it to be signalled by a failure of the summation in ( [ kprop ] ) to converge or the bulk - boundary propagator to in fact diverge at all .",
    "equally striking is what adding rotation does not change : there is still no imaginary periodicity in @xmath176 .",
    "the singularities in the propagator are given by solving a quadratic in @xmath176 , so there will be singularities at two locations in the complex plane for given @xmath177 .",
    "thus , perhaps surprisingly , there is no thermal behaviour associated with the inner horizon in this representation of the propagator , even though we are restricted to the region outside the inner horizon .",
    "we would argue that this is again a sign that the inner horizon is not a true regular horizon in the spacetime , because of the blueshifting instability .",
    "let us now determine the singularities in this lorentzian propagator in detail .",
    "note that the source point is by assumption located on the boundary ; we established earlier that this corresponds to @xmath178 .",

    "as in  @xcite , there is a technical difficulty in that the natural range of integration in the euclidean metric is @xmath186 , and we do not understand how to perform an analytic continuation subject to this kind of restriction .",
    "however , the propagator ( [ ekprop ] ) is symmetric under the antipodal map @xmath187 so long as @xmath188 is even .",
    "hence , at least in this case , we can treat the region @xmath189 as another copy of the black hole solution , and obtain the correct answer for the amplitude by integrating over the full @xmath190 plane and then dividing the final answer by two .",
    "let us therefore consider an integration over the euclidean section , where the source points lie on the circle @xmath191 , and the integration over @xmath176 runs from @xmath192 to @xmath193 .",
    "the singularities then lie initially at @xmath194^{1/2 } \\over \\cosh    r_+ \\delta \\phi_n},\\ ] ] where @xmath195 is defined by @xmath196 , @xmath197 . as in the btz",
    "coordinates , we see that the singularities associated with the euclidean solution lie at imaginary @xmath94 real , so that the singularities associated with future ( resp .",
    "past ) lightlike separation are to the right ( left ) of our contour of integration .",
    "the analytic continuation here looks still more complicated than in the previous case ; however , once again we can avoid complications in the motion of the singularities by a convenient choice of path . instead of keeping @xmath198 real at intermediate stages in the analytic continuation",
    ", it is better to assume we keep @xmath199 real .",
    "the analytic continuation then involves only the first term in ( [ eksing ] ) , and will rotate the singularities counter - clockwise . if we similarly rotate the contour counter - clockwise , we will wind up with the usual @xmath95 prescription , where we make the substitution @xmath200 in ( [ ekprop ] ) .",
    "the analytic continuation is thus accurately represented by the simple picture given in figure  [ fig : def2 ] .",
    "we are left with an integration over the full @xmath201 plane for each vertex .",
    "however , as we saw above , the full @xmath201 plane contains regions @xmath163 and @xmath164 , as well as the regions @xmath202 of interest .",
    "it is thus a double cover of a single kruskal patch @xmath203 in the lorentzian black hole .",
    "we can simply cancel this double cover against the factor of a half that came from the double cover we introduced in the euclidean black hole , and obtain an integration just over the region @xmath204 corresponding to a single copy of the kruskal patch . as in  @xcite , this will lead to a slightly more complicated @xmath95 prescription in the regions @xmath205 .",
    "the main point is that , by analytic continuation , we can express the bulk spacetime version of the calculation of a cft amplitude either in terms of an integration of the interaction vertices over regions @xmath45 and @xmath106 in the rotating black hole , with the @xmath206 prescription given in the previous section , or in terms of an integration over regions @xmath107 and @xmath162 , with the @xmath206 prescription given here .",
    "thus , such amplitudes involve the region behind the event horizon , but outside of the cauchy horizon .",
    "our main objective in this paper has been to deepen our understanding of the relation between the field theory and the spacetime in the ads / cft correspondence for spacetimes with horizons .",
    "we have shown that in rotating btz , the bulk calculation of field theory amplitudes defined by analytic continuation can be expressed in two ways , in terms of an integral over the region outside the horizon , or in terms of an integral over the region bounded by past and future cauchy horizons .",
    "this extends previous work  @xcite to include rotation .",
    "a feature which deserves to be stressed again is that the analytic continuation from the euclidean black hole gives us an integral over both asymptotic regions , @xmath45 and @xmath106 . in particular",
    ", the analytic continuation of the single boundary in euclidean btz gives us the two boundaries in lorentzian btz . in the original coordinate system , this arises because the deformed contour defining the real - time thermal field theory involves two horizontal segments , interpreted as independent fields on the two boundaries that are entangled by the state of the cft . in the poincare disc coordinates , we pass from the connected boundary @xmath207 in euclidean space to the two - sheeted boundary @xmath151 in lorentzian space .",
    "the black hole is thus still represented by a pure state  an entangled state of the two field theories .",
    "it seems natural that such a pure state will contain complete information about the bulk spacetime .",
    "if we trace over the degrees of freedom on one boundary , the resulting thermal state on the other boundary will no longer contain enough information to describe the region behind the horizon .",
    "the main value of adding rotation is that it highlights the importance of the cauchy horizon as a boundary .",
    "we have seen that amplitudes can be related to an integral over the region bounded by the cauchy horizons . for lorentzian ads ,",
    "a state in the field theory is conjectured  @xcite to be dual to the initial state in the bulk ads spacetime , encoded by data on some cauchy surface .",
    "it therefore seems very natural that the calculation of amplitudes in the field theory involves the region determined by this initial data .",
    "we conjecture that in general , the cft description is not limited to the spacetime region which is visible from infinity  that is , it does not stop at event horizons .",
    "it stops only when we encounter a cauchy horizon .",
    "this conjecture gains further support from carefully considering the horizon in the poincare coordinates on pure ads . in  @xcite",
    ", it was found that the region behind the horizon in poincare coordinates is included in the cft description , because the cft naturally lives on the whole einstein static universe @xmath208 , and not just in minkowski space @xmath209 .",
    "put another way , the cft on @xmath209 determines the bulk spacetime within the poincare horizon ; to go beyond it , we need to fix boundary conditions on other parts of the boundary of ads .",
    "the boundary of the poincare patch is an ( observer - dependent ) event horizon , but it is also the cauchy horizon for a @xmath210 constant surface in poincare coordinates ( supplemented by the boundary conditions supplied by the field theory on @xmath211 ) .",
    "thus , the result of  @xcite , that an extension of the field theory ( from @xmath209 to @xmath208 ) is necessary to describe the region of spacetime beyond the poincare horizon , is perfectly consonant with relating the field theory to the region bounded by the cauchy horizons .",
    "in fact , our consideration of the rotating btz black hole is very close in spirit to the analysis of  @xcite . the periodic identification in @xmath24 that defines the black hole has played only a spectator role in our discussion .",
    "thus , one could equally well apply our analysis to ads in btz coordinates without the identification along @xmath24 .",
    "we would then say that what we have learnt is that if one considers the the field theory just on those regions of the boundary where @xmath212 is spacelike , it is dually related to the region of the spacetime which is determined by cauchy data supplemented by the asymptotic boundary conditions on this portion of the boundary .",
    "so the discussion here is in a sense a generalisation of  @xcite , considering the restriction to a different region of the boundary .",
    "if the field theory only describes the region of spacetime before the cauchy horizon , what is the physical interpretation of the region beyond that horizon ? in some special cases , such as the poincare coordinates in pure ads , this is an unnatural restriction , and the spacetime beyond the horizon can be included in the description by an extension of the field theory which supplies the necessary boundary conditions .",
    "however , we will further conjecture that generically there will be no such extension  the region beyond the cauchy horizon is not included in the ` hologram ' , so it is unphysical .",
    "thus , the ads / cft correspondence enforces strong cosmic censorship for such solutions  @xcite .",
    "the classical description will break down at the cauchy horizon , so no observer can study quantum effects from a safe distance .",
    "the idea that the spacetime is cut off at the cauchy horizon receives support from previous calculations , which have shown that an observer approaching the cauchy horizon inside a rotating black hole will generically encounter a divergent flux of radiation due to the infinite blueshift  @xcite .",
    "thus , the classical theory does predict its own downfall there .",
    "this should be contrasted with the situation at the event horizon , where an observer crossing the horizon will see nothing special .",
    "an important direction for future work is to understand to what extent this blueshifting instability is reflected in the cft calculations we have discussed here , and more generally to see evidence for the conjectured breakdown of the classical spacetime description at the cauchy horizon and understand what replaces it .",
    "if the event horizon is not a fundamental barrier , why does it remain so difficult to answer questions about physics there ?",
    "one part of the answer to this question , as pointed out in  @xcite , is that the size of a black hole , from the viewpoint of an infalling observer , is never greater than the characteristic curvature scale of the ads space .",
    "this remains true for rotating black holes : the proper time taken to fall from the outer to the inner event horizon of a rotating black hole is bounded from above by a number of order one in ads units for any value of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , one obstacle to understanding the observations of infalling observers is that we do not know how to recover approximately local bulk physics on scales smaller than the ads scale from the field theory .",
    "making progress on this issue will be essential to gain a better understanding of the description of the black hole s geometry in the field theory .",
    "another barrier to understanding is that the part of the connection between bulk and boundary we understand well is the relation of the asymptotic behaviour of fields in spacetime and the expectation values of local operators in the field theory .",
    "this can be used indirectly to understand some features of the description of sources in the bulk in terms of their effects at large distances , but does not tell us how the cft describes changes in the bulk whose effects have not yet propagated to the boundary . understanding the cft degrees of freedom which describe the bulk more directly is the problem of precursors  @xcite .",
    "precursors are supposed to reflect events deep inside the spacetime without ( immediately ) changing any local observables in the cft .",
    "the region behind the black hole s event horizon provides a particularly sharp example of this problem , as events in this region can never effect the asymptotic region , so they will only ever be reflected in the cft through non - local observables tied to the precursors .",
    "this point was also discussed in  @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the description of changes behind the event horizon will also require progress on our understanding of the direct description of the interior of spacetime in the dual cft .",
    "the present calculation reinforces the arguments that the region inside the event horizon is included in the cft description , but it does not address these deep questions concerning how that description is implemented .    finally , it would be interesting to explore the extension of these calculations to higher dimensions",
    ". this will clearly be more challenging , as the construction of suitable coordinate systems in our work here has relied on cunningly exploiting the locally ads character of the btz black holes .",
