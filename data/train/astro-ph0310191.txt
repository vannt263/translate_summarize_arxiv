    "the core accretion model @xcite provides the most popular explanation for the origin of the solar system s gas giants , and is consistent with the higher frequency of extrasolar planets found to be orbiting metal - rich stars @xcite . in the simplest version of this model , a core grows at a fixed orbital radius from the binary accretion of solid planetesimals @xcite .",
    "initially , this core is surrounded by a near - hydrostatic gaseous envelope , with most of the luminosity being provided by ongoing planetesimal accretion .",
    "growth continues until a critical mass is exceeded . above the critical mass",
    "there is no stable core - envelope solution , and more rapid accretion of the bulk of the planetary envelope ensues .",
    "observational constraints from the solar system pose two possible problems for core accretion models .",
    "first , although jupiter can form within the lifetimes of protoplanetary disks @xcite , it is hard to form uranus and neptune in their present locations rapidly enough .",
    "this has prompted suggestions that the outer giant planets may have migrated outward from birthplaces closer to the sun @xcite .",
    "second , upper limits to the core mass of jupiter , derived from galileo data , are _ smaller _ than most theoretical estimates .",
    "@xcite obtains a firm constraint of @xmath1 , which is reduced to @xmath2 using a more model - dependent approach .",
    "this is only marginally consistent with the @xmath3 core predicted by @xcite , and has led to renewed interest in models for massive planet formation via disk instability @xcite .",
    "the possibility that orbital migration @xcite of planetary cores might reduce the accretion time scale and ameliorate these problems was recognized by @xcite . in a laminar disk flow , however , gravitational torques from the disk induce a rapid , uniformly inward drift @xcite . the benefit of a higher accretion rate must therefore be balanced against the reduced residence time of the planet in the disk . in this letter , we point out that this trade - off may not be necessary in a turbulent disk",
    ". numerical simulations @xcite of the migration of low mass planets within turbulent magnetized disks ( which extend work by nelson & papaloizou 2003b ; winters , balbus & hawley 2003 ) show that for low enough masses , the _ sense _ as well as the rate of migration is determined by turbulent fluctuations in the disk . as a result",
    ", the planet random walks in orbital radius as it grows .",
    "this behavior was suggested as a likely consequence of migration in a magnetized disk by @xcite .",
    "here , we quantify how random walk migration affects massive planet formation .",
    "we begin our calculations by assuming that a @xmath4 solid core , with density @xmath5 g @xmath6 , has formed at @xmath7 au in a disk with a local surface density of planetesimals of @xmath8 g @xmath9 , and a surface density profile of @xmath10 . according to @xcite the solid core grows at the rate @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the effective , or capture , radius",
    ", @xmath13 is the angular frequency , and @xmath14 is the gravitational enhancement factor @xcite",
    ". we will denote the total planet mass ( core plus envelope ) by @xmath15 .",
    "the planetesimal accretion produces a core luminosity of @xmath16 . with this",
    "we can construct quasi - equilibrium models of the envelope using standard stellar structure equations .",
    "the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium , mass conservation , and radiative transfer are @xcite @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the pressure , @xmath19 the density , @xmath20 the temperature , @xmath21 the distance from the planet center , @xmath22 the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath23 the mass enclosed within @xmath21 , and @xmath24 the smaller of the radiative or adiabatic temperature gradients .",
    "the inner boundary is located at the core radius and , as in @xcite , the outer boundary is located at the smaller of the hill radius , @xmath25 , or the accretion radius , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the planet s orbital radius , and @xmath28 is the local gas sound speed in the disk .",
    "the envelope is taken to be a hydrogen and helium mixture , with mass fractions of 0.7 and 0.28 respectively , and with an equation of state given by @xcite .",
    "opacities from @xcite are used in calculating the radiative temperature gradient .",
    "the adiabatic temperature gradient is found from the equation of state tables @xcite .    to solve equations ( 1 - 3 ) we need to calculate the planetesimal accretion rate , which depends on @xmath29 , @xmath14 , and @xmath12 . the planetesimal surface density  which is more precisely the time - dependent mean surface density within the planet s feeding zone  and the gravitational enhancement factor both depend only on @xmath15 , and can be calculated using expressions given by @xcite and @xcite . for the capture radius",
    "we adopt a simpler approach than @xcite , and take @xmath12 to be the radius at which a planetesimal with a radius of @xmath30  km , falling radially through the planet s envelope , has intercepted a mass of @xmath31 of its own mass .",
    "since this depends upon the planet s structure , we iterate at each timestep to find a self - consistent solution .",
    "if more than one solution is possible ( with different planet masses ) , we choose between them by requiring that the total planet mass can not decrease with increasing time .",
    "we then advance to the next timestep by incrementing the core mass , and by updating @xmath32 to account for the mass of planetesimals accreted on to the core in the current timestep .",
    "we neglect both the shepherding effect of a migrating core upon the planetesimals @xcite ( which would reduce the accretion rate ) , and the possibility of diffusion of the planetesimals due to the same fluctuating potential that causes core migration ( which might increase the accretion rate ) .",
    "our model for planetary growth is a slightly simplified version of that used by @xcite .",
    "if we assume , as they did , that the core remains at a fixed radius , almost identical growth rates are obtained .",
    "figure [ polmass ] shows the core mass and total planet mass against time for a core fixed in radius at @xmath7 au .",
    "there is an initially rapid growth phase ( their phase i ) in which the core grows to a mass of @xmath33 in less than @xmath34 myr , followed by a second phase ( phase ii ) in which the core grows slowly to a mass of @xmath35 .",
    "once the core reaches this mass , the gaseous envelope grows extremely rapidly ( phase iii ) , producing a final planet mass , in this case , of @xmath36 , and a total growth time of just over @xmath37 myr .",
    "if the disk at 5  au is turbulent , the latest simulations of migration suggest that the core may actually undergo a random walk in orbital radius .",
    "after @xmath38 steps of size @xmath39 , the typical distance moved will be @xmath40 .",
    "we find that the most interesting behavior occurs for planets that wander by a few tenths of an au per myr , which can be accomplished by moving the core either in or out by a distance @xmath41 every @xmath42  yr , with the direction of motion determined randomly .",
    "this ` coarse - grained ' approach ignores smaller time scale fluctuations , but we have verified that including these ( while keeping the overall amount of migration constant ) does not substantially alter the results .",
    "figure [ ranmass ] shows the core mass and total planet mass as a function of time , for a simulation in which the core started at @xmath7 au , but then random walked through the disk .",
    "we also plot the migration track of the core for this specific realization .",
    "the onset of rapid growth of the envelope occurs in a time of less than @xmath34 myr , an order of magnitude less than that obtained for a core fixed in radius .",
    "these results can be understood in terms of the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "for a given planetesimal accretion rate there is a critical core mass @xmath44 above which the core can not support a stable envelope . below this mass",
    "there are generally two solutions , a high - mass solution and a low - mass solution . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the low - mass solution has a small envelope mass , so that @xmath46 .",
    "as the core mass approaches @xmath44 , the envelope mass increases , ultimately contributing @xmath47 % of the total planet mass . moreover , the critical mass increases with increasing planetesimal accretion rate . as a result , for a given core mass",
    ", the low mass solution decreases with increasing accretion rate , while the high mass solution increases with increasing accretion rate .",
    "when the core is fixed in radius the planetesimal accretion rate initially increases with time as the core and planet grow .",
    "this growth , however , depletes the planetesimals in the feeding zone @xcite , resulting in the accretion rate reaching a peak and then declining to an approximately constant value . for the parameters of the calculation shown in figure  [ polmass ] , this plateau is at @xmath48 . at this stage",
    "the core mass is @xmath33 , well below the critical core mass for this planetesimal accretion rate of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the core and planet therefore grow slowly , taking @xmath50 myr , until the core mass nears the critical core mass . once at the critical core mass , the low mass envelope solution is no longer valid .",
    "however , since the accretion rate depends on the total planet mass , a high mass solution is possible .",
    "the envelope mass is therefore determined by the high mass solution and the planet , and core , grow rapidly .",
    "this halts when the planetesimal accretion rate saturates , and the total planet mass exceeds the high mass solution for that accretion rate .",
    "this occurs , in this case , at a total planet mass of @xmath36 .",
    "when the core is able to random walk through the disk , the result is quite different .",
    "the random walk allows the core to not only sample a larger region of the disk , but also prevents a single region from being depleted to the same extent as when the core is stationary .",
    "the planetesimal accretion rate can therefore be maintained at a much higher value , and the core grows more rapidly @xcite .",
    "this is a generic feature of _ any _ migration model , and it may be offset , in part , by the tendency of a migrating core to shepherd planetesimals away from the feeding zone @xcite .",
    "what is more novel about the random walk case is that the planetesimal accretion is also highly variable , and this is what ultimately leads to the rapid growth phase in this scenario .    at early times , as in the stationary case , the core mass is significantly lower than the local @xmath44 , the total planet mass is dominated by the core , and the planet grows via the accretion of planetesimals . in this regime ,",
    "when @xmath43 is less than about @xmath2 , the variable accretion rate occasioned by migration simply means that the planet grows at a variable rate .",
    "if , however , the core mass approaches the local critical core mass , the envelope mass can become quite significant . once @xmath43 reaches @xmath51 , it is possible for the core to migrate into a region where the accretion rate is low enough for the core mass to be reasonably close to the local critical core mass .",
    "the planet then acquires an envelope that contributes a non - negligible portion of the total planet mass .",
    "if , subsequently , the core random walks into a region where the accretion rate is considerably higher , the low - mass stable envelope solution @xcite would again have the planet mass dominated by the core . this would , however , require a decrease in the total planet mass .",
    "such a decrease is unlikely to be physical , since it would require shedding a bound envelope whose binding energy has presumably already been radiated as an additional contributor to the planetary luminosity .",
    "accordingly , we assume that the low - mass solution remains inaccessible , in which case the envelope grows rapidly , reaching , in this case , a mass of @xmath52 .    within this model , the core mass at which the rapid growth phase occurs depends on the specific random walk of the core .",
    "if the core is able to stay in a region of high accretion rate for a long time , the critical core mass will be higher than if the core , fairly early on , random walks into and then out of a region with a low accretion rate . from additional runs ,",
    "we find typical cores masses are between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we have also experimented with altering the rate of migration .",
    "if the planet executes a random walk with a larger amplitude  as some of the simulations suggest  the end result is rapid formation of a gas giant with a massive core .",
    "for example , a run with @xmath55 and @xmath56 led to rapid accretion after 0.5  myr , with a core mass of @xmath57 .",
    "we expect qualitatively similar results if the migration includes a steady radial drift in addition to the fluctuating component , since steady drift would similarly allow the core to sample a very wide range of disk radii .",
    "these results suggest that under standard solar nebula conditions we can form jupiter rather rapidly , but with a core mass that may still be too large @xcite . since the derived formation time for jupiter at 5  au is smaller than the lifetime of the solar nebula , however , it is possible to trade off some of the reduction in formation time for a smaller core mass .",
    "figure  [ jupcore ] shows that if we reduce the initial planetesimal surface density at 5  au to @xmath7 g @xmath9 , the lower time - averaged accretion rate allows the onset of rapid growth to occur at a smaller final core mass . in this model",
    "the growth time is now longer ( @xmath58 myr ) , but the core mass at the end of the calculation has been reduced to only @xmath59 .",
    "depending upon the additional mass of heavy elements accreted during the subsequent phases of growth , this could be consistent with the apparently low core mass of jupiter .",
    "if gas giants form within turbulent regions of the protoplanetary disk , numerical simulations @xcite show that fluctuating disk torques can cause growing cores to wander in orbital radius .",
    "we have incorporated a simple treatment of this random walk migration into models for the formation of gas giants via core accretion , and find that for standard solar nebula conditions the formation time scale of jupiter can be reduced by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "potentially , this could allow massive planets to form via core accretion at greater orbital radii , or in disks with smaller planetesimal surface densities , than previously suspected .",
    "for the solar system , a modestly _ smaller _ surface density of planetesimals ( 5  g  @xmath9 ) allows for the timely formation of jupiter with an initial core mass @xmath60 , in better agreement with observational constraints .    for extrasolar planetary systems",
    "the main implication is that for protoplanetary disks of modest mass and solar metallicity , the formation time scale for giant planets at 5  au is significantly less than the typical disk lifetime @xcite . at smaller radii",
    " closer to the snow line @xcite  the time scale would be shorter still .",
    "this implies that giant planets could form in less favorable conditions , either in clusters where the disk lifetime was shorter , or around lower metallicity stars with smaller reservoirs of planetesimals ( though if planets are common in m4 , as suggested by @xcite , their formation by core accretion is still problematic ) .",
    "the observed preponderance of metal - rich stars as planetary hosts may then arise from a combination of an enhanced _",
    "probability _ of forming multiple planets at high metallicity , coupled with frequent destruction of planets via type  ii inward migration @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank john papaloizou , richard nelson and keith horne for useful discussions .",
