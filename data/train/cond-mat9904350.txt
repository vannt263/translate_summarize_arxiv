    "optical second harmonic generation ( shg ) has been proven to be a very useful technique for the investigation of ferromagnetism at surfaces .",
    "the obvious question is if this technique can also yield some new information in the case of more general spin configurations , such as antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering .",
    "an experimental answer to this question has been provided by fiebig _",
    "@xcite , who obtained a pronounced optical contrast from af 180@xmath0 domains of rhombohedral bulk cr@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the authors attributed this contrast to the interference of magnetic and electric dipole contributions , the latter being present only below the nel temperature . since it is known that , in _ cubic _ materials , within the electric dipole approximation , optical shg originates only from surfaces , interfaces , or thin films , an important question is if shg is also sensitive to antiferromagnetism at surfaces of cubic antiferromagnets . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the surface of a cubic material can lower the symmetry of an af fcc crystal ( two - sublattice antiferromagnet ) in a way similar to the trigonal distortion in a four sublattice antiferromagnet cr@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "besides , even the imaging of af _ domains _ is possible also for many cubic materials that exhibit unit - cell doubling .",
    "the first theoretical explanation of _ linear _ magneto - optic effects in ferromagnets has been given by argyres @xcite in the 50s .",
    "he used linear response theory for current - current correlation functions .",
    "his microscopic explanation was already based on the combination of spin - orbit and exchange coupling .",
    "experimental techniques for the detection of af domain _ walls _ using linear optics in some special geometries were elaborated a few years later  @xcite .",
    "the _ interior _ of the domains has been visualized in piezoelectric af crystals using a linear magneto - optical effect @xcite .",
    "however , linear optical experiments suffer from mixing the desired signal with a contribution from other linear effects , such as birefringence or dichroism .",
    "a review of linear optical experimental methods for the investigation of af domains is given by dillon  @xcite .",
    "the observation of domain structure in antiferromagnets is more complicated than in ferromagnetic materials since the reduction of the spatial symmetry is , unlike for ferromagnets , not linked to an imbalance in the occupation of majority and minority spin states . on the basis of group",

    "for that reason , some authors , e.g. frhlich @xcite suggested the application of nonlinear optics even for k - selective spectroscopy , since multi - photon phenomena allow for the `` scanning '' of a small part of the brillouin zone , at least for semiconductors . recently , non - linear optics has attracted more and more attention for the investigation of magnetism due to its enhanced sensitivity to twodimensional _",

    "nonlinear optical effects were invoked to explain the behavior of lasers in magnetic fields @xcite , to investigate high temperature superconductors @xcite , and to study structures composed from alternately ferro- and antiferromagnetically ordered thin films @xcite .",
    "one of the first theoretical investigations of the possibility to apply nonlinear optics to _ antiferromagnetism _ was performed by kielich and zawodny @xcite .",
    "however , the first experiments concerning the detection of the af domains in materials such as cr@xmath1o@xmath2 were carried out only recently  @xcite . already in the 70s",
    ", it has been proposed @xcite that experimental studies of dc magnetic and electric field - induced shg could become an effective method of determining the crystal structure of solids , the symmetry of which can not be investigated by other methods .",
    "extending this idea towards surface crystallography provides us with a new technique for determining the spin configuration in a given surface structure . in turn",
    ", it permits to use a known magnetic configuration for the determination of the surface structure .",
    "all the mentioned effects are more difficult or even impossible to obtain in linear optics , and moreover other linear methods like neutron scattering have difficulties to probe af spin configurations .",
    "the nonlinear magneto - optical susceptibility tensor @xmath4 ( the source for shg within the electric dipole approximation ) has predominantly been investigated from the symmetry point of view .",

    "this approach then allows them to study the thickness and the character ( bloch vs. nel type ) of domain walls .",
    "an attempt by muthukumar _ et .",
    "@xcite to calculate the @xmath4 tensor elements for the antiferromagnetic cr@xmath1o@xmath2 both from group theory as well as _ from the microscopic point of view _ is rather unique .",

    "@xcite , however , pointed out that the occurrence of purely real or imaginary values of the tensor elements plays a decisive role for the existence of shg from this substance .",
    "they found that for a ( cro@xmath5)@xmath1 cluster shg can take place only in the case where the tensor elements are imaginary , and thus should vanish in muthukumar s approximation .",
    "they proposed to take into account the full unit cell with four inequivalent cr ions including their `` twisting '' interaction with the environment .",
    "however tanabe _ et al .",
    "_ neglected the dissipation in the process of shg @xcite , which is a rather crude approximation .",

    "@xcite , af ordering lowers the symmetry of an otherwise centrosymmetric crystal . in this paper , however , we rely on the idea that , rather than lowering the crystal symmetry in the bulk , shg may also result from the breaking of inversion symmetry at the surface of a bulk inversion - symmetric system .    magnetically active oxide layers are of importance for the construction of tmr ( tunneling magnetoresistance ) devices , where a trilayer structure is commonly used .",
    "the central layer of tmr devices consists of an oxide sandwiched between a soft and a hard magnetic layer ( these two layers are often composed from the same material but of different thicknesses ) . for these technological applications",
    "it is necessary to develop a technique to study buried oxide interfaces .",
    "such a technique can be shg .",
    "one of the most promising materials for the mentioned devices is nio .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the understanding of its detailed spin structure is scarce - even the spin orientation on the ferromagnetically ordered ( 111 ) surfaces is not known .",
    "the technique presented here can shed some light on that issue .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present our methods for obtaining sets of nonvanishing @xmath4 tensor elements . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of our analysis , first for the nondistorted surface of a simple fcc structure ( subsection iii.a ) , then for the the distorted one ( iii.b ) .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the influence of a second kind of magnetic atoms ( iii.c ) and of oxygen sublattice distortion ( iii.d ) . the issue of domain imaging is addressed in subsection iii.e .",
    "possible experimental geometries allowing for the detection of the mentioned structures and effects are discussed in sec .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "based on group theory , dhn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a new nonlinear magneto - optic kerr effect ( nolimoke ) at the surface of cubic antiferromagnets .",
    "they also gave an example of an antiferromagnetic structure ( nio ) and an optical configuration , where this new effect could be observed .",
    "here , we perform a complete group - theory based analysis of collinear af fcc low - index crystal surfaces . surfaces of other crystal structures are as well described by our theory provided they are similar to fcc crystal surfaces , i.e. squares or hexagons .",
    "the results can be used to detect the magnetic order of a specific surface under investigation and allow for the determination of the surface spin configuration in some important cases . however , in order to calculate the shg yield quantitatively , it is necessary to go beyond the present study and use electronic calculations of the nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "group theory can give a unified picture of different experimental observations and predict new effects @xcite , while the microscopic origins of the observed phenomena may remain unclear . in order to be clear with respect to the essential notion of time reversal we would like to emphasize the point of view taken in this paper in the beginning .",
    "here , we do not divide @xmath4 into even and odd parts in the magnetic order parameter .",
    "instead , the behavior of @xmath4 with respect to the magnetic order parameter ( which for ferromagnetic materials corresponds to the dependence of @xmath4 on magnetization ) is fully taken into account by the considerations of the magnetic point group . at no stage of our consideration",
    "we invoke the notion of time reversal , consequently we do not apply the characterization of the susceptibility @xmath7 as c - tensor ( changing its sign in the time - reversal operation ) or i - tensor ( invariant under the time - reversal operation ) @xcite .    before we start our group theoretical classification of the nonlinear optical susceptibilities of af surfaces we would like to emphasize the following four important points : + ( i ) we are not interested in effects resulting from the _ optical path difference _ from adjacent crystal planes which are ferromagnetically ordered but only antiferromagnetically coupled to each other . we do not consider this as an intrinsic af effect .",
    "+ ( ii ) cubic crystals that we are interested in reveal a center of inversion in the para- , ferro- , and all antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "thus , within the electric dipole approximation , the shg signal from the bulk vanishes .",
    "+ ( iii ) while in principle linear optical methods can be sensitive to the presence of a spin structure , in practice they are not useful because , within the group theoretical approach , they can not distinguish the af phase from either paramagnetic or ferromagnetic , nor can they distinguish different af configurations from each other .",
    "they have to resort to methods like lineshape analysis , where no strong statements characteristic for symmetry analysis can be made .",
    "+ ( iv ) although the tensor elements for all the magnetic point groups are known and tabulated in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , the connection between the different spin configurations described by us and the mentioned symmetry groups has not been made , except for some easy cases @xcite .",
    "thus , for shg from antiferromagnetic surfaces there has been up to now no connection between the group theoretical classification and the real situations found in experiments .",
    "the following part of the text should explain the fundamentals of applying nolimoke observations to investigate antiferromagnetism of surfaces .",
    "now we turn to shg , the source of which is the nonlinear electrical polarization @xmath8 given by : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the electric field of the incident light , while @xmath4 denotes the nonlinear susceptibility within the electric dipole approximation , and @xmath11 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "the intensity of the outgoing shg light is @xcite : @xmath12 ^ 2\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the intensity of the incident light , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) describe fresnel and geometrical factors for the incident ( reflected ) light , @xmath16 and @xmath17 angles of incidence and reflection , respectively ( @xmath16=@xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is output ( input ) polarization angle . according to neumann s principle , `` any type of symmetry which is exhibited by the crystal is possessed by every physical property of the crystal '' @xcite . to examine these physical properties , we determine the magnetic point group of the crystal lattice ,",
    "thus determine its symmetries .",
    "the same symmetries must leave the investigated property tensor ( in our case the nonlinear electric susceptibility  @xmath4 ) invariant .",
    "this fact is mathematically expressed by the following condition : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is a representation of an element of the magnetic point group describing the crystal . for symmetry operations including the time reversal there should be an additional `` @xmath22 '' sign in eq.([eq2 ] ) , but we do not use it here since we exclude the time reversal from our consideration . in particular , from eq.([eq2 ] ) it follows immediately that polar tensors of odd rank ( such as  @xmath4 ) vanish in inversion symmetric structures .",
    "this explains why shg is possible only at surfaces and interfaces , where this symmetry is broken .",
    "for a given spin configuration we apply eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) for every symmetry operation exhibited by the system .",
    "thus , each of these symmetries gives rise to a set of 27 equations with 27 unknown elements of the tensor @xmath4 .",
    "this set can be reduced to 18 equations , since @xmath23 which expresses the equivalence of the incident photons of frequency @xmath24 , see also the reduced notation in eq .",
    "( [ eqglown ] ) .",
    "the analytic solution of even this reduced set of equations seems cumbersome , but the set can be split into several decoupled subsets . for example , an obvious subset in every case is the equation @xmath25 , this tensor element occurs nowhere else .",
    "the rank of other subsets is , for our cases , never higher than six . in this manner ,",
    "one may obtain a set of forbidden elements of the susceptibility tensor as well as relations between existing ones .",
    "first , we will define the notions of `` phase '' , `` case '' , and `` configuration '' , used henceforth to classify our results .",
    "`` phase '' describes the magnetic phase of the material , i.e. paramagnetic , ferromagnetic , or af .",
    "secondly , the word `` configuration '' is reserved for the description of the magnetic ordering of the surface .",
    "it describes various possibilities of the spin ordering , which are different in the sense of topology .",
    "we describe up to 18 af configurations , denoted by little letters a ) to r ) , as well as several ferromagnetic configurations , denoted as `` ferro1 '' , `` ferro2 '' , etc .",
    "the number of possible configurations varies depending on surface orientation .",
    "thirdly , we describe different `` cases '' , i.e. additional structural features superimposed on the symmetry analysis .",
    "`` case a '' does not have such additional features . in `` case b ''",
    "we address distortions of the lattice .",
    "`` case c '' deals with two kinds of magnetic atoms in an undistorted lattice . in `` case d ''",
    "we take into account a distorted sublattice of nonmagnetic atoms , keeping the magnetic sublattice undistorted .",
    "all the analysis concerns collinear antiferromagnets , with one easy axis .",
    "the tables show the shg response types for each configuration .",
    "the various response types are encoded by a `` key '' , which is then decoded in tab .",
    "[ keytab ] .",
    "this table presents the symmetries , domain operations , and nonvanishing tensor elements for each response type .",
    "this is done in order to shorten the overall length of tables , because a given response type can appear in several different cases .",
    "several spin structures depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are distinct configurations only in case b , and they are addressed in the tables that concern only this case . for the rest of the cases they are domains of other , fully described configurations ,",
    "thus they are left out in these cases .",
    "the philosophy of the paper is that , to save some space , we show the spin structure in one figure for each surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] ) for all the four cases ( a - d ) , and depict the effects taken into account in the cases b - d only for the paramagnetic phase ( fig [ fdis111 ] , [ fnierow ] , and [ ftlen ] ) . table [ keytab ] also contains the information on the parity of the nonvanishing tensor elements : the odd ones are printed in boldface . in some situations an even tensor element ( shown in lightface ) is equal to an odd element ( shown in boldface ) , this means that this pair of tensor elements is equal in the domain which is depicted on the corresponding figure , but they are of opposite sign in the other domain .",
    "this happens in the structures where two pairs of domains are possible ( two distinct entries in table [ keytab ] ) .",
    "the tensor elements that change their parity in the domain operation which is the inverse of the displayed one are shown in italic font .",
    "for example , the entry j ) of table [ keytab ] shows a tensor element _ xxx _ , which is even under the operation @xmath26 , this means that this tensor element is odd under @xmath27 .",
    "this strange at the first sight behavior of tensor elements is caused by the fact that under these operations , tensor elements are not mapped on themselves . in our example , after applying @xmath26 the tensor element @xmath28 becomes @xmath29 , without changing its sign .",
    "if we now apply @xmath27 , @xmath29 ( which is now even ) becomes @xmath28 , again without changing the sign .",
    "the parity of the elements has been checked in the operations @xmath30 , @xmath26 , and in the operation connecting mirror - domains to each other ( for the definition of the mirror - domain structure see subsection e ) .",
    "the domain operation(s ) on which the parity depends is ( are ) , if applicable , also displayed in this table . if two or more domain operations have the same effect , we display all of them together . to make the table [ keytab ] shorter and more easily readable some domain operations ( and the corresponding parity information for the tensor elements )",
    "are not displayed , namely those that can be created by a superposition of the displayed domain operations .",
    "we also do not address the parity of tensor elements in the @xmath31 nor @xmath32 operations for ( 111 ) surfaces nor any other operation that `` splits '' tensor elements , although these operations also lead to a domain structure @xcite . as will be discussed later ( subsection",
    "e ) it is possible to define a parity of the tensor elements for the @xmath32 and @xmath31 operations , however the tensor elements then undergo more complicated changes .",
    "the situations where the parity of the tensor elements is too complicated to be displayed in the table are indicated by a hyphen in the column `` domain operation '' .",
    "for some configurations , none of the operations leads to a domain structure - in those configurations we display the information `` one domain '' .",
    "the reader is referred to the appendix for the particularities of the parity check .",
    "as far as the first layer is concerned , we address all the spin configurations of the low index surfaces of fcc antiferromagnets , with magnetic order vector lying in plane or perpendicular to it and antiferromagnetic coupling between nearest neighbors . for the ( 001 ) surfaces we also discuss the configurations , where the antiferromagnetic coupling exists between the second - nearest neighbors ( configurations a ) , b ) , c ) , f ) , and o ) , along with d ) , g ) , and h ) for case b. ) .",
    "we do not consider the coupling to the third and further neighbors .",
    "this would not give rise to configurations of different symmetries in two dimensions .",
    "it may at most replace spins by grains ( blocks ) of spins in the configurations described by us .    throughout this paper we take into account the spin structure only of the first ( uppermost ) atomic layer .",
    "this is sufficient to study all the symmetries of ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) surfaces both in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases . for the ( 111 ) surface it is necessary to recognize the atomic positions ( but not the spins ) in the second layer for the same purpose . for the sake of completeness we also present a study of ( 111 ) surfaces without this extension",
    "however , in the antiferromagnetic phase , the spin structure of the second and deeper layers plays a role in determining the symmetry of the surface .",
    "this is presented in this paper using the ( 001 ) surface as an example .",
    "for the ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces it will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "these structures can serve as simple models for deriving predictions for more complicated cases , while the full consideration of the second layer would not bring any new interesting results . taking into account the spin structure of the second layer ( deeper layers do not bring up anything new to the analysis ) results in creating several ( up to two for the ( 001 ) surface and three for the ( 111 ) surface ) configurations out of each one addressed here by us . the symmetry of these configurations may remain the same or be lowered ( sometimes even below the symmetry of the ferromagnetic phase ) with respect to the `` two - dimensional '' configurations they are generated from .",
    "consequently the distinction of the configurations from each other may be limited , but the possibility to detect the magnetic phase is not severely affected . also our remarks on domain",
    "imaging remain valid",
    ". however the number of domains is increased , thus the possibility to identify each of them might be hampered .",
    "consequently , one can state that the symmetry of an af surface depends on two atomic layers .",
    "they are also necessary ( and sufficient ) to define af bulk domains .",
    "as will be presented in our results , shg can probe both these layers on af surfaces .",
    "the predicted new nonlinear magneto - optical effects result from the fact that the magnetic point groups of antiferromagnetic configurations are different from those describing paramagnetic or ferromagnetic phases of the same surface . since , depending on the magnetic phase , different tensor elements vanish , it is possible to detect antiferromagnetism optically by varying the polarization of the incoming light .",
    "the current subsection discusses nonvanishing elements of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor for an fcc crystal consisting of only one kind of magnetic atoms .",

    "we do not consider it as a domain structure if one portion of the surface is in one configuration and another portion is in a different configuration .",
    "under such conditions , we can encounter two different types of domains : @xmath35 domains ( for the ( 111 ) surface they are rather @xmath40 domains ) , resulting from the rotations around @xmath36 axis , and the second type ( called by us mirror - domains , characteristic for antiferromagnets ) , where spins point along the same axis in all domains , but the ordering is still different ( they are no @xmath39 domains ! ) .",

    "the @xmath35 type domains will be addressed later on . in the mirror - domain structure , the magnetic point group describing the configuration must lack an operation that , while belonging to the ( nonmagnetic ) point group of the system _ and _ leaving the spin axes invariant , only flips some of the spins .",
    "note , the flipped subset of the spins must be antiferromagnetically ordered in itself .",

    "this tensor element is even in the domain operation @xmath54 ( which is equivalent to the superposition of @xmath41 and @xmath26 ) , which means that domains related to each other by this operation can not be imaged using this particular tensor element .",
    "similarly , if a tensor element is odd in one domain operation and even in another , it must be odd in their superposition .",
    "concerning the @xmath40 domains for ( 111 ) surfaces , the parity of the tensor elements must be treated more carefully , as indicated already in @xcite .",
    "we can still define three `` twofold '' operations , and each of them has its own set of odd and even tensor elements .",
    "the sets corresponding to different of those operations are not mutually exclusive , i.e. a tensor element is usually shared among different parities . in this way , this tensor can be positive in one domain , negative in the second , and zero in the third one .",
    "thus , the existence of a well defined parity of tensor elements is necessary for domain imaging , but not sufficient for @xmath40 and @xmath55 domain structure .",
    "this unleashes an interesting question of the antiferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "there are as many order parameters as different domain structures for a given configuration . for @xmath40 and @xmath55 domain structures ,",
    "the af order parameter must be a vector , while for mirror domains it is a number . for @xmath35",
    "domains it is can be also a number , since there are only _ two _ @xmath35 domains .",
    "the vectorial order parameter transforms itself under the domain operation like a usual vector .",
    "it is necessary to mention at this point that taking into account the spin structure in the _ second layer _ would not change the validity of the analysis presented in this subsection .",
    "the only modifications would result from addressing bulk domains rather then surface domains , and the symmetry of the af configurations would be changed .",
    "yet it would still be possible to find domain operations as well as odd and even tensor elements leading to interference and af domain contrast .",

    "we propose an experimental setup for the _ detection _ of antiferromagnetism in the following way : both the incident and reflected beams may lie in the @xmath57 plane ( optical plane ) , and form the angle @xmath16 with the @xmath36-axis ( normal to the sample surface ) . in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the outgoing beam axis , the electric field of the second - harmonic generated light has two components , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , given by the formulae @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the components of the electric field resulting from shg in the coordinate system of the sample .",
    "the dependence of these components on the input electric field is indicated by the tensor @xmath7 .",
    "the aim of the experiment is the determination of vanishing and nonvanishing tensor elements .",
    "the easiest way to do this is to analyze the output signal intensity as a function of the input polarization in both output polarizations @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for a fixed angle of incidence and reflection .",
    "the dependence of the output second - harmonic electric field on the input polarization is schematically displayed in fig .",
    "[ fel]a)-c ) for all tensor elements .",
    "the intensity of shg light is the square of the linear combination of these partial responses .",
    "an example of the intensity dependence on the input polarization is presented in fig . [",
    ". the intensity need not be symmetric with respect to @xmath66 , this results from the influence of the electric field depicted in fig . [",
    "the coefficients of the mentioned combination are the products of the @xmath7 tensor elements and the corresponding fresnel coefficients , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqglown ] ) . thus performing a best fit of these coefficients to the experimental results",
    "will give ( after taking into account the fresnel and geometrical coefficients , known for the given experimental geometry and material @xcite ) a set of non - vanishing elements of the @xmath7 tensor .",
    "thus for instance , the magnetic phase can be determined .    concerning another experimental geometry , with input polarization fixed and intensity measured as a function of the output polarization , it is possible to determine whether the nonlinear kerr effect takes place .",
    "for instance , with the input polarization @xmath67 , the output electric field is given as follows @xcite : @xmath68 as the result , maximum of the intensity is for @xmath69 , if at least one of the tensor elements @xmath70 or @xmath71 does not vanish .",
    "actually , tensor element @xmath71 is even in all the investigated order parameters , but the tensor element @xmath70 can be odd . for such configurations the kerr effect ( change of polarization caused by inversion of the magnetic order parameter ) takes place .",
    "thus , it is possible to determine which tensor elements are associated with the spin - orbit coupling .    the geometry with p polarization of the reflected shg light seems to be less useful , since there the tensor element @xmath47 is always present , regardless of the configuration .",
    "besides , this polarization mixes the @xmath72 and @xmath73 tensor elements .",
    "this mixing , however , can be tuned by varying the angle of incidence @xmath16 and taking into account the influence of the fresnel coefficients . for smaller @xmath16",
    "only the @xmath72 elements are important , while for larger @xmath16 the @xmath73 dominate .",
    "if the experiment does not show any difference for these two situations , the tensor elements must be related .",
    "this is the possibility to distinguish the configurations with some relations between the tensor elements from those without such relations . on the other hand , the p polarization is useful for af domain _",
    "imaging_. thus one of the experimental possibilities is to carry out the measurements first in s polarized outgoing shg light to make sure that the material is in the af phase and determine its spin configuration .",
    "then a second measurement in p polarization can be performed for the domain imaging .",
    "already a short look at the presented tables shows that our method works best if the paramagnetic phase is of high symmetry , since then a wide variety of different symmetries exists which may be broken by different spin configurations . in other words",
    ", there is enough room for different new tensor elements to appear along with different spin ordering under these circumstances . in general , this is the main reason why only nonlinear optics is suited for the detection of antiferromagnetism and the imaging of af domains .",
    "the linear susceptibility tensor has too low a number of elements for these purposes in order to produce unambiguous results .",
    "similarly , among the considered surfaces , the ( 110 ) surface is the least useful for the analysis as it yields ambiguous signal interpretations due to its low symmetry in the paramagnetic phase , and , on the other hand , very similar symmetries in all the af configurations .",
    "the ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces present alike possibilities of distinction between the cases .",
    "if more than one monolayer is involved , however , the ( 111 ) surface will give the same response in the cases a ( all atoms equivalent ) and c ( two kinds of magnetic atoms ) .",
    "both the ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) surfaces also allow for the determination of the spin structure , provided the case is known .",
    "the ( 111 ) surface in the case d ( oxygen sublattice distortion ) is an exception - all the af configurations produce the same response .",
    "it is possible , however , to determine the phase of the material .",
    "the case d appears to be a subgroup of the case c , i.e. all the magnetic point groups describing the configurations of the case d are subgroups of the corresponding ones in the case c. the only exception is the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "this inclusion means that the oxygen sublattice distortion makes some ( one half of all ) magnetic atoms distinguished as in case c , even though we did not apply this distinction explicitly in case d.    from the fact , that the influence of oxygen sublattice distortion ( case d ) is not detectable in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases it follows that only antiferromagnetic ordering can give an extensive information about the structure of the surface .",
    "it is the magnetic atoms and their magnetism which reveal the presence and position of oxygen .",
    "our short analysis of an af bilayer structure ( surface ( 001 ) ) indicates very similar features to the ( 001 ) monolayer . there exists a possibility to distinguish af configurations from each other , and a certain possibility to detect the magnetic phases .",
    "furthermore , introducing the second atomic layer does not affect the possibility to image af domains .    concerning the _ magnetic _ phases , configurations and cases considered in this paper , some _ a priori _ information about the _ structure _",
    "is needed in order to draw unique conclusions from the experimental results . for the detection of the phase and the spin configuration",
    "this additional information is the case ( a , b , c , d ) .",
    "vice versa , the case ( for instance a possible distortion of the oxygen sublattice ) can be determined if one knows the configuration ( and if it had been previously deduced that the investigated material is antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "actually , in most measurements of af spin structures some _ a priori _ knowledge is required .",
    "for example , in experiments by fiebig _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite such a prerequisite is the assumption of the af spin - flop phase of the material . in both experimental approaches mentioned here",
    "the ( 001 ) surface seems to provide the best possibilities of drawing valuable conclusions , while the ( 110 ) surface is the least suitable in that respect .",
    "finally , our paper demonstrates that the af domain imaging is possible even in the presence of magnetic unit - cell doubling .",
    "thus optical shg , unlike linear optics , is able to image af _ surface",
    "_ domains . for most af configurations",
    ", there are more than one surface domain structures .",
    "the rule stating that the number of domains is equal to the number of symmetry operations in the paramagnetic phase divided by the number of symmetry operations in the magnetic phase is applicable also for antiferromagnets ( thus , with unit - cell doubling the number of domains is reduced by a half ) .",
    "however , not all the domains can be imaged at the same time .",
    "in this appendix , we would like to address some particularities of our group - theoretical analysis .",
    "the first general remark is that although symmetry analysis can provide us with a set of nonvanishing tensor elements for a given configuration , but can not give any information about their magnitude .",
    "this equally applies to the distortion effects , as treated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another interesting issue is the behavior of the tensor elements with respect to the af order parameter * l * ( for ferromagnetic phases * l * should be replaced by the magnetization * m * ) , i.e. the parity of tensor elements . in general , a tensor element consists of even and odd parts with respect to * l * , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ element ] ) . in systems with high symmetry , it is possible to describe an operation which reverses * l * ( or * m * ) by a spatial operation @xmath74 .",
    "the operation @xmath74 belongs to the point group of the system , but not to its magnetic point group .",
    "the application of this operation to a tensor element will change its sign ( keep it invariant ) if this element is odd ( even ) in * l*. consequently , each tensor element can be either odd or even in * l * , a mixed behavior is forbidden .",
    "actually , the parity of a given tensor element is a function of the chosen operation @xmath74 . in most antiferromagnetic configurations more than one operation leading to different domain structures are possible ( this means , more than one order parameter can be defined ) .",
    "for example , for ( 001 ) surface one has @xmath26 rotations leading to different domains _ in addition _ to the eventual mirror - structure . for the ( 111 ) surface , there are three domains resulting from the rotations with respect to the @xmath36 axis alone . for some configurations ,",
    "they exist in addition to the mirror - domains .",
    "this whole analysis of the parity of the tensor elements can not be performed for the systems with a lower symmetry , where it is impossible to find an operation @xmath74 describing the inversion of * l * or * m * , a mixed behavior is then allowed .",
    "note , the presence of dissipation ( redistribution of response frequencies ) does not influence the above consideration . in general , dissipation in frequency space is responsible for the mixing of the real and imaginary parts in the tensor elements , while point - group symmetry governs the ( non)existence of tensor elements purely odd or even in the magnetic order parameters * l * or * m*.      99 m. fiebig , d. frhlich , b. b. krichevtsov , and r. v. pisarev , phys .",
