    "in 1980s , e. witten @xcite first described the morse complex with respect to morse function @xmath1 and riemannian metric @xmath2 .",
    "the chain groups @xmath3 are free abelian groups generated by the critical points of @xmath1 with morse index @xmath4 , while the boundary homomorphisms are defined by counting the number of gradient trajectories flowing from one critical point @xmath5 to another one with a lower morse index .",
    "it was proved that the morse homology is isomorphic to the singular homology of the manifold .",
    "then in 1990s , when considering the floer homologies , k. fukaya found that similar ideas could be used in morse homology theory . in @xcite , he defined the @xmath0-structure for the morse category , in which the objects were morse functions and the morphisms @xmath6 between two objects @xmath7 were the morse complex with respect to @xmath8 . for generic morse functions @xmath9 , let @xmath10 be a critical point of @xmath11 , @xmath12 be a critical point of @xmath13 .",
    "denote by @xmath14 the cardinality of the dimension - zero moduli space @xmath15 , i.e. the set of gradient trajectory trees starting from @xmath16 and ending at @xmath17 .",

    "in fact , the cup product in morse category can be paralleled with the product structure on derham complex in a way . in @xcite , k. w. chan , n.",
    "c. leung and z. n. ma proved that the cup products on derham complex have semiclassical limits as the cup product defined by counting gradient trajectory trees with respect to morse functions .",
    "furthermore , the theory can be generalized to absolute homology for manifolds with boundary and relative homology .",
    "m. schwarz @xcite introduced a method of constructing the relative morse complex . for manifold @xmath20 , its submanifold @xmath21 , and a morse function @xmath1 on @xmath20 , he proved that the morse complex of @xmath1 on @xmath21 could be treated as a subcomplex of the morse complex of @xmath1 on @xmath20 after doing some slight modifications . in this case",
    ", he was able to define relative morse complex by using the quotient complex .",
    "due to the way of defining the complex , it is easy to see that the homology of the relative morse complex is exactly the relative homology of @xmath22 . besides , m. akaho(see @xcite ) defined a morse complex for manifolds with boundary , by examining certain critical points of cone end morse functions and riemannian metric . to be specific ,",
    "let @xmath23 be a collar neighborhood of the connected component @xmath24 of the manifold s boundary , and @xmath25 be the factor of @xmath26 .",
    "then a cone end morse function @xmath1 is one that satisfies @xmath27 in the collar neighborhood , while a cone end riemannian metric is one that satisfies @xmath28 .",
    "then he used the internal critical points as well as the specific critical points on boundary @xmath29 such that @xmath30 to generate the morse complex .",
    "he proved that the morse homology is isomorphic to the absolute singular homology of the manifold with boundary , through observing the handlebody decomposition of the manifold with respect to unstable manifolds of the critical points as well as the relative cycles .",
    "moreover , he defined the cup product structure in @xcite , serving as a prototype of @xmath0-categorification of absolute morse homology theory for manifolds with boundary . also , for compact manifolds with boundary , f. laudenbach @xcite introduced a method that allows one to define morse complex whose homology is isomorphic to absolute or relative singular homology without the requirement in geometric settings .",
    "the profound works given by the predecessors motivate our work in this paper .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider the @xmath0 categorification of the relative morse homology theory .",
    "however , the definition of the relative morse homology in this paper is different from that of m. schwarz . to be specific",

    "then by excision lemma , the homology of @xmath36 is isomorphic to that of @xmath37 , \\partial m \\times [ 0,\\epsilon])$ ] , and thus isomorphic to @xmath38 .",
    "then for manifold @xmath20 with boundary , we choose special riemannian metric @xmath2 satisfying @xmath39 near the boundary , and horn - end transverse morse functions satisfying @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are nonzero constants . with the above preparations , we define the relative morse complex directly while avoiding usage of quotient complex as in @xcite .",

    "the @xmath48 here only embraces those critical points in @xmath49 and on ` positive boundaries ' , but not including all the ones with morse index @xmath4 .",
    "after that , we prove the homology of this complex is isomorphic to the manifold s singular homology relative to its boundary . in this step ,",
    "we use the handlebody decomposition of the manifold and treat the homology of this decomposition as a bridge linking the relative morse homology and the relative singular homology .",
    "[ t1 ] the relative morse homology @xmath50 is isomorphic to the relative singular homology @xmath51 .    at last ,",
    "we define the @xmath0-structure , still using the technique of counting the gradient trajectories .",
    "we first discuss the cup product structure and prove the leibnitz rule as an example of the more complicated @xmath0-relationships .",
    "then , let @xmath52 be a generic sequence of functions on @xmath20 such that @xmath53 is transverse morse function for @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a critical point in @xmath56 and @xmath57 be a critical point in @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "when the morse indices satisfy @xmath60 , the moduli space @xmath61 of gradient trajectory trees originating from @xmath62 and ending at @xmath55 is a dimension - zero manifold .",

    "actually we can see here that the degree of a critical point @xmath57 should be @xmath66 so that the @xmath0-relationships hold true .",

    "finally , for @xmath70 , the category of transverse morse functions on @xmath20 , we will have    [ t2 ] @xmath70 is endowed with the @xmath0-category structure using @xmath71 .      in section 2",
    ", we introduce the definitions about horn - end transverse morse functions , which are the functions we use throughout the paper , and its critical points .",
    "after that , we construct a decomposition(handlebody decomposition ) of @xmath20 .",
    "then in section 3 , we construct the relative morse complex of @xmath20 , and prove that the homology of the complex we defined is isomorphic to the relative singular homology using handlebody decomposition . and",
    "lastly in section 4 , we categorify the relative morse theory by defining the morse category , and endow the category with @xmath0-structure .",
    "in this section , we introduce the definition of horn - end transverse morse function @xmath1 and its critical points , and then introduce the handlebody decomposition of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath1 .",

    "we only consider _ horn - end transverse functions _ which are transverse morse functions satisfying that on each collar neighborhood @xmath84 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a nonzero constant .",

    "@xmath88 is continuous .    for a collar neighborhood @xmath84 , @xmath92",

    "so @xmath110 requires that @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the second equation shows that @xmath113 is a trajectory line of @xmath99 , thus @xmath111 means that @xmath113 is a critical point .",
