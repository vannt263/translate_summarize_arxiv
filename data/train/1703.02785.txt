    "<S> full - dimensional semiclassical dynamical calculations are reported for the photofragmentation of isocyanic acid in the s@xmath0 state . </S>",

    "<S> isocyanic acid , hnco , is the simplest molecule that contains h , c , n and o atoms , which are essential for life and major constituents of chemical species in chemistry and biology . since its discovery in 1830 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , hnco has been identified in diverse media . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , this molecule is found in over sixty galactic sources and in nine external galaxies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is relatively highly abundant and it is suggested to be strongly involved in prebiotic chemistry occurring there . </S>",
    "<S> especially , it is a major component of the photochemistry of building blocks of life ( dna bases and amino acids ) . </S>",
    "<S> isocyanic acid has been identified in the atmosphere @xcite where hnco sources are from both anthropogenic and biomass burning , and also released from combustion ( e.g. fuels , cigarettes @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is known to be toxic and easily dissolves in water ( in lungs ) posing obvious health risks such as the development of atherosclerosis , cataracts and rheumatoid arthritis @xcite and inflammations that can lead to cardiovascular disease . to - date </S>",
    "<S> , the health effects of isocyanic acid , its role in the atmosphere and its photochemistry are not fully known nor understood .    </S>",
    "<S> the photochemistry of hnco under uv radiations or in combustion sources is complex . besides the importance of isocyanic acid in diverse fields ( see above ) , its unimolecular decomposition processes represent benchmarks for tetratomic molecules evolution upon electronic excitation . </S>",
    "<S> adiabatically , the lowest hnco singlet electronic states can not lead to the formation of nh ( x@xmath1 ) + co(x@xmath2 ) products . instead , the observed formation results from electronically excited nh(a@xmath3 ) photofragment ( with co(x@xmath2 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies showed that around 200 nm wavelengths , hnco mainly photodissociates in the first excited singlet state s@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> internal conversion to the s@xmath4 ground state ( @xmath5a@xmath6 ( 1 @xmath5a ) ) through seams of conical intersections with the s@xmath0 state ( @xmath5a@xmath7 ( 2 @xmath5a ) ) leads to the photofragments , h + nco @xcite , by spin - allowed unimolecular decay , to nh(x@xmath1 ) + co(x@xmath2 ) , after intersystem crossing and decomposition on the lowest triplet state potential .    </S>",
    "<S> up - to - date experimental investigations of hnco photodissociation have been performed by yang and co - workers @xcite . in 2007 </S>",
    "<S> , they @xcite    the exact quantum treatment of the photodissociation dynamics of tetratomic molecular systems is at the capacity limit of today s theoretical and numerical techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true for the title process , as four different atoms are involved and no symmetry can be used to converge calculations by means of reasonable basis sizes ( not to mention the significant mass of the three second raw atoms that is a complicating factor ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we used the newly developed classical trajectory method ( ctm ) in a quantum spirit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this semiclassical approach proved to lead to nearly quantitative predictions for several bimolecular , unimolecular and vibrational predissociation processes @xcite . as for photodissociations , ctm in a quantum spirit involves the three following steps : ( i ) selecting the set of initial conditions of trajectories from the wigner distribution associated with the internal state of hnco before the optical excitation @xcite ; ( ii ) running trajectories from these initial conditions up to the separated products @xcite ; and ( iii ) deducing from the final conditions the pair - correlated keds , vsps and aps by applying bohr quantization rule @xcite to product vibrational motions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this basic rule of quantum mechanics states in a language suited to the present problem that one should only take into account those classical trajectories reaching the products with integer vibrational actions . </S>",
    "<S> this has a significant influence on the final results when only a small number of vibrational states are available to the products , as is the case for the fragmentation of hnco at 201 and 210 nm . on the other hand , between ten and several tenths of rotational states are available to the products for this process , so rotational motions need not be pseudo - quantized . </S>",
    "<S> strict application of bohr s condition of quantization is , however , too restrictive from a numerical point of view and , instead , trajectories are usually assigned gaussian statistical weights such that the closer the vibrational actions to integer values , the larger the weights . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is known as gaussian binning ( gb ) @xcite and ctm in a quantum spirit will thus be called gb - ctm . within the framework of bimolecular collisions , gb has been shown to be consistent @xcite with the semiclassical theory of molecular collisions pioneered by miller and marcus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more technical details on the gb - ctm calculations presented further below can be found in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate system used in this work is represented in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> instead , hnco was kept planar throughout its fragmentation , being thus reduced to a five - dimensional ( 5d ) system . for the sake of realism , however , out - of - plane motions should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> about two decades ago , klossika and schinke @xcite built an @xmath10 planar potential energy surface ( pes ) fitted to high - level _ ab - initio _ calculations ( ks - pes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus took advantage of the availability of this high - quality ks - pes to which we added a contribution depending mainly on @xmath11 and the dihedral angle @xmath12 , fitted to equation of motion coupled - cluster calculations . </S>",

    "<S> the energy available to the products is such that @xmath5nh can only be in the vibrational ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions assigned to the @xmath16 rotational levels are also shown ( dashed curves ) . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , the main features of the experimental keds ( threshold and cut - off kinetic energies , positions of the rotationally - resolved peaks , overall shape ) are well reproduced by our theoretical treatment . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , both sets of data show the production of rotationally cold @xmath5nh molecules , with @xmath16 smaller than @xmath17 10 .    -0.5 cm   and @xmath18 ( assuming a perfect energy - resolved experiment).,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    fig .  [ figure4 ] shows similar comparison at 201 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the displayed experimental keds were obtained from slicing images of @xmath5nh in the vibrotational states ( @xmath19 ) = ( 0,5 ) and ( 1,6 ) @xcite ( see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> s1-s3 for more @xmath5nh states ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , the overall agreement between experiment and theory ( solid curves ) is very satisfying ( the best agreement being achieved for ( 0,9 ) , ( 1,6 ) , ( 1,8 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bimodality of the rotational state distributions of co in the vibrational ground state , seen in the right - lower panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4 ] , is clearly reproduced in the left - lower panel . </S>",
    "<S> the production of rotationally hot co , discussed further below , is striking in both the experimental and theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case for the ( 1,4 ) and ( 1,8 ) states ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to emphasize that the quality of the accord for both wave lenghts would be lost without respecting bohr quantization , as recently illustrated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed curves in the left panels are the co vibrational state contributions to the total ked . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , most of them ( see also figs .  </S>",
    "<S> s1-s3 ) are bimodal to some extent . </S>",
    "<S> the areas below the dashed curves are proportional to the populations of their corresponding @xmath20 values , thus leading to the @xmath5nh state - resolved vsd of co after _ ad - hoc _ renormalization to unity ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one thus sees from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4 ] and s1-s3 that theory does not predict any vibrational inversion at 201 nm , whatever the @xmath5nh state probed . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with the conclusions of yang and co - workers @xcite who found that the vsds of co peak at 1 for @xmath21=0 and nearly all the values of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> however , these authors recognize that one can not avoid any ambiguity in the co vibrational assignment of a given pair - correlated ked when its @xmath20-resolved components overlap @xcite .    -0.5 cm   and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence between combs and @xmath20 is shown in the right panels.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    the theoretical aps ( between -0.95 and -0.8 at both 210 and 201 nm ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s4 ) are slightly lower than the measured ones ( between -0.8 and -0.5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our approach corroborates the experimental finding that the fragmentation proceeds through a fast direct impulsive mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this is also consistent with the short theoretical lifetime of hnco between its optical excitation and its fragmentation ( 305 and 175 fs at 210 and 201 nm , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in the supplemental material how relaxing two constraints ( @xmath23 ; internal conversion to s@xmath4 ignored ) in our calculations should improve the predictions .    finally , in order to check the validity of the supposed link between ( i ) bimodality of rotational state distributions and ( ii ) involvement of two @xmath24 and @xmath9 hnco isomers in the fragmentation dynamics @xcite , we have calculated the distribution of the dihedral angle @xmath12 at @xmath25 bohr , distance nearly defining both transition states ( tss ) ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s5 ) . for the vast majority of the trajectories ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath12 is larger than 90 , which separates the basins of attraction of the @xmath24 and @xmath9 hnco isomers and their associated tss . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 being equal to 180at the @xmath9 ts , the @xmath24 ts crossing is clearly a minor event . </S>",
    "<S> note that at the franck - condon ( fc ) geometry ( @xmath27 ) , the system lies within the @xmath9 basin . </S>",
    "<S> though selecting initial conditions according to the wigner distribution necessarily generates many trajectories with an initial motion directed towards the @xmath24 basin , the forces towards the @xmath9 basin result sufficiently strong to redirect the trajectories towards it . consequently , </S>",
    "<S> the bimodality observed theoretically does not result from the involvement of two @xmath24 and @xmath9 hnco isomers in the dissociation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we have found that the bimodality is the consequence of an impulsive - deflective mechanism suggested by the two trajectories displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] ( representing more than 80 % of the trajectories ) . </S>",
    "<S> the red path undergoes a strong impulsion from the wigner region down to the bottom of the well , followed by a deceleration insufficient to prevent the system from crossing the @xmath9 ts with a large angular velocity @xmath28 and thus , a large rotational excitation of co. the blue trajectory performs one loop before leaving the well , but its path beyond the inner ( last ) turning point is fairly similar to the red path . if all the trajectories were like the two previous ones , the rotational distribution would be a relatively narrow unimodal peak centred at @xmath29 . however , part of the trajectories appear to be deflected by the potential wall lying on the right - side of the mountain pass en route to the product valley ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] ; this region is approximately defined by @xmath11 within [ 3.8 , 4.8 ] and @xmath13 below 90 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is , for instance , slightly the case of the red path . </S>",
    "<S> this deflection , if strong enough , may make the final direction of the trajectories nearly parallel to @xmath11 , leading thereby to a rotationally cold co. consequently , the strong initial impulsion and the subsequent deflection create the large peak and the smaller bump , respectively , as is clearly visible in the lower panels of fig .  [ figure4 ] .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical dynamics of the photofragmentation hnco @xmath30 nh(a@xmath3 ) + co(x@xmath31 ) at 201 and 210 nm have been examined , assuming this process entirely takes place in the s@xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , accurate semiclassical trajectory calculations on a new 6d - pes have been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the pair - correlated kinetic energy distributions ( keds ) and anisotropy parameters ( aps ) measured by yang and co - workers @xcite , following state - selective detection of either co or @xmath5nh via rempi , have been calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the positions , widths and shapes of the keds are in good agreement with the experimental ones for most co or @xmath5nh states probed . </S>",
    "<S> the aps are also in satisfying agreement with experiment , though the perpendicular polarization of the angular distributions is slightly overestimated by theory . on the other hand , we found that the vibrational state distributions ( vsds ) at 201 nm do not involve any inversion , in contrast with the vsds deduced from the experimental keds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimentally deduced vsds are necessarily equivocal when the co - product state - resolved components of the keds overlap , as is the case at 201 nm , whereas the theoretical determination of the vsds is unambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> we thus see no contradiction between our results and the measurements of yang and co - workers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> last but not least , theory precludes the possibility of any link between the existence of two @xmath24 and @xmath9 hnco isomers and the bimodality observed in the keds , as speculated in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , our treatment shows that bimodality should be the consequence of an impulsive - deflective mechanism due to two repulsive walls of the 6d - pes , the first one producing rotationally hot co products , the second one cooling part of them . </S>",
    "<S> these findings provide new insights into the dissociation dynamics of the title tetratomic prototype fragmentation .    at the moment , </S>",
    "<S> pair - correlated keds , vsps and aps for dissociations involving more than three atoms have been much more often measured than theoretically predicted . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> , the present work fills an important gap ensuring the synergy between experiment and theory for these complex processes . </S>",
    "<S> this work can be straightforwardly extended to the description of state - to - state photodynamics through imaging techniques for polyatomics playing crucial roles in atmospheric and environmental chemistry .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to thank dr . </S>",
