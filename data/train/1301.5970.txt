    "in the last few years , impressive advances have been made in understanding the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations through solar neutrino experiments@xcite-@xcite , atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite , reactor based experiments @xcite,@xcite and accelerator based experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the recent measurements of angle @xmath0 @xcite-@xcite have undoubtedly improved our understanding of the neutrino mixing matrix . interestingly",
    "a not so small value of @xmath4 which is close to chooz @xcite bound and to the cabibbo angle , coupled with the fact that @xmath5 may not be maximal @xcite , @xcite , strongly indicates that there may not be any symmetry in the leptonic sector @xcite .",
    "these observations have also deepened the mystery of flavor mixings as the pattern of quark and lepton mixing angles now looks to be significantly different . since the mixing angles are related to the corresponding mass matrices , therefore , formulating viable fermion mass matrices becomes all the more complicated especially when quarks and leptons have to be described in a unified framework .    in the absence of any compelling theory of flavor dynamics to explain the fermion masses and mixings ,",
    "the present day approaches can be broadly categorized into ` top - down ' and ` bottom - up ' .",
    "the top - down approach consists of formulating the fermion mass matrices at grand unified theories ( gut ) scale based on certain fundamental theoretical principles .",
    "however , in the absence of any such viable approach , it is desirable to follow the bottom - up approach .",
    "this approach consists of finding the phenomenological fermion mass matrices which are in tune with the low energy data , thereby providing hints for the formulation of mass matrices at the gut scale . as an example of this approach , texture specific mass matrices , introduced implicitly by weinberg @xcite and explicitly by fritzsch @xcite , have played an important role in understanding the pattern of quark and lepton mixing phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently , in the light of observation of neutrino mixing angle @xmath6 , fukugita @xmath7 @xcite ( henceforth referred to as fsty ) have updated their previous analysis @xcite of texture 6 zero fritzsch - like lepton mass matrices for normal hierarchy of neutrino masses and have arrived at some interesting conclusions . in particular , considering majorana neutrinos with normal hierarchy of neutrino masses as well as the recent measurements of angle @xmath0 the authors find the mass of the lightest neutrino to be 0.7 - 2.1 mev .",
    "further , the effective majorana mass @xmath8 , appearing in the double beta decay , comes out to be 3.7 - 5.6 mev .",
    "also , it has been shown that the sum of the masses of the three neutrinos is 61 @xmath9 2 mev .",
    "furthermore , fsty without getting into details , have also concluded that inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of the neutrino masses are ruled out .",
    "recently , in the case of quarks it has been shown @xcite that not only fritzsch - like but also non fritzsch - like texture 6 zero mass matrices have been ruled out .",
    "therefore , in case one has to formulate quark and lepton mass matrices on the same footing , as advocated by smirnov @xcite , perhaps there is a need to go beyond texture 6 zero mass matrices even for the leptons .",
    "further , recent measurements of angle @xmath3 as well as continuous refinements of the other two mixing angles and corresponding mass square differences also provide the necessary motivation to go beyond the minimal texture considered by fsty .",
    "the purpose of the present communication , on the one hand , is to rule out inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses corresponding to texture 6 zero lepton mass matrices . on the other hand , keeping in mind that the texture 5 zero mass matrices are not ruled out completely in the quark sector , we have made an attempt to extend the analysis of fsty to texture 5 zero fritzsch - like lepton mass matrices with an emphasis on the implications of angle @xmath3 . in particular , we have carried out a detailed analysis pertaining to hierarchies of neutrino masses as well as the implications of @xmath3 and the other two mixing angles on the lightest neutrino mass for the two possible cases of texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices .",
    "the detailed plan of the paper is as follows . in section ( [ form ] )",
    ", we detail the essentials of the formalism regarding the texture specific mass matrices .",
    "inputs used in the present analysis have been given in section ( [ inputs ] ) and the results and discussion have been presented in section ( [ cal ] ) . finally , section ( [ summ ] ) presents a few comments and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "to define the various texture specific cases considered here , we begin with the modified fritzsch - like mass matrices , e.g. , m_l= ( 0 & a _ l & 0 + a_l^ * & d_l & b_l + 0 & b_l^ * & c_l ) , m_d= ( 0 & a _ & 0 + a_^ * & d _ & b _ + 0 & b_^ * & c _ ) , [ frzmm ] @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively corresponding to dirac - like charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices .",
    "both the matrices are texture 2 zero type with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in case these are symmetric then @xmath14 and @xmath15 should be replaced by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as well as @xmath18 and @xmath19 should respectively be defined as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the texture 6 zero matrices can be obtained from the above mentioned matrices by taking both @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be zero , which reduces the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 each to texture 3 zero type .",
    "texture 5 zero matrices can be obtained by taking either @xmath24 and @xmath25 or @xmath26 and @xmath27 , thereby , giving rise to two possible cases of texture 5 zero matrices , referred to as texture 5 zero @xmath24 case pertaining to @xmath28 texture 3 zero type and @xmath11 texture 2 zero type and texture 5 zero @xmath26 case pertaining to @xmath28 texture 2 zero type and @xmath11 texture 3 zero type .    to facilitate the understanding of inverted hierarchy case and its relationship to the normal hierarchy case",
    ", we detail the essentials of formalism connecting the mass matrix to the neutrino mixing matrix . for detailed diagonalization procedure",
    "we refer the readers to our earlier work @xcite , however , to make the manuscript readable we outline the essentials .",
    "texture specific hermitian mass matrix @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , can be expressed as m_k= p_k^ m_k^r p_k , [ mk ] where @xmath31 is a real symmetric matrix with real eigenvalues and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are diagonal phase matrices .",
    "the matrix @xmath31 is diagonalized by the orthogonal transformation @xmath34 yielding m_k = q_k o_k _ k m_k^diag o_k^t p_k,[mkeq2 ] wherein , to facilitate the construction of diagonalizing transformations for different hierarchies , we have introduced @xmath35 defined as @xmath36 for the case of normal hierarchy and as @xmath37 for the case of inverted hierarchy .",
    "the charged leptons case is fairly straight forward , whereas in the case of neutrinos , the diagonalizing transformation is hierarchy specific as well as requires some fine tuning of the phases of the right handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath38 . noting @xmath39 and using see - saw mechanism m_=-m_d^t(m_r)^-1m_d , we can write m_=-p_d o_d m_d^diag _ d o_d^t q_d^t ( m_r)^-1 q_d o_d _ d m_d^diag o_d^t p_d . assuming fine tuning , the phase matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 along with @xmath42 can be taken as @xmath43 as well as using the unitarity of @xmath44 and orthogonality of @xmath45 , the above equation can be expressed as m_= p_d o_d o_d^t p_d .",
    "[ mnu ]    the lepton mixing matrix , in terms of the matrices used for diagonalizing the mass matrices @xmath28 and @xmath46 , can be easily obtained and is expressed as u = ( q_l o_l _ l)^ ( p_d o_d ) . [ mix ]",
    "eliminating the phase matrix @xmath47 by redefinition of the charged lepton phases , the above equation becomes u = o_l^ q_l p_d o_d , [ mixreal ] where @xmath48 , without loss of generality , can be taken as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 being related to the phases of mass matrices and can be treated as free parameters .    to understand the relationship between diagonalizing transformations for different hierarchies of neutrino masses and for the charged lepton case , we present the diagonalizing transformation @xmath34 , whose first element can be written as o_k(11 ) =  , [ diaggen ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are eigenvalues of @xmath29 . in the case of charged leptons , because of the hierarchy @xmath55 , the mass eigenstates can be approximated respectively to the flavor eigenstates , as has been considered by several authors @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , one can obtain the first element of the matrix @xmath59 from the above element given in equation ( [ diaggen ] ) , by replacing @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , e.g. , o_l(11 ) =  .    equation ( [ diaggen ] ) can also be used to obtain the first element of diagonalizing transformation for majorana neutrinos , assuming normal hierarchy , defined as @xmath63 , and also valid for the degenerate case defined as @xmath64 , by replacing @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , e.g. , o_(11 ) = [ omajnh ] , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are neutrino masses .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is to be divided by @xmath71 , however as @xmath23 is arbitrary therefore we retain it as it is .    in the same manner ,",
    "one can obtain the elements of diagonalizing transformation for the inverted hierarchy case , defined as @xmath72 , by replacing @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 in equation ( [ diaggen ] ) with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , e.g. , o_(11 ) = [ omajih ] .",
    "the other elements of diagonalizing transformations in the case of neutrinos as well as charged leptons can similarly be found .",

    "[ angles2 ] for the purpose of calculations , we have taken the lightest neutrino mass , the phases @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath81 as free parameters , the other two masses are constrained by @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the normal hierarchy case and by @xmath84 in the inverted hierarchy case .",
    "it may be noted that lightest neutrino mass corresponds to @xmath85 for the normal hierarchy case and to @xmath70 for the inverted hierarchy case .",
    "for all the three hierarchies of neutrino masses , the explored range of the lightest neutrino mass is taken to be @xmath86 , however our conclusions remain unaffected even if the range is extended further .",
    "the mixing matrix u , given in equation ( 7 ) can be constructed in terms of the elements of the transformations @xmath87 and @xmath88 as well as in terms of the phases @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in the absence of cp violation in the leptonic sector ,",
    "phases have been given full variation from 0 to @xmath89 to obtain the viable ranges of the mixing angles . in carrying this fit",
    "we have constrained @xmath81 , the free parameters , such that diagonalizing transformations @xmath59 and @xmath90 always remain real .",
    "this implies , for leptons @xmath91 , for majorana neutrinos @xmath92 for normal hierarchy and @xmath93 for inverted hierarchy .",
    "to begin with , we discuss the case of inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses for texture 6 zero as well as texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices . as a first step , in the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices ,",
    "we have made an attempt to explicitly show the ruling out of inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses , thereby reinforcing the conclusions of fsty @xcite . to this end in figures ( [ fig1]a ) , ( [ fig1]b ) and ( [ fig1]c ) , we have plotted the parameter space corresponding to sines of any of the two mixing angles by constraining the third angle by its experimental bound given in equation ( [ angles2 ] ) and giving full allowed variation to other parameters . also included in the figures are blank rectangular regions indicating the experimentally allowed @xmath94 c.l .",
    "region of the plotted angles .",
    "interestingly , a general look at these figures reveals that inverted hierarchy is clearly ruled out . in particular , from figure ( [ fig1]a ) showing the plot of @xmath95 versus @xmath96 , one can immediately conclude that the plotted parameter space of these two angles has no overlap with their experimentally allowed @xmath94 c.l .",
    "this clearly indicates that at 3@xmath97 c.l .",
    "inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses is not viable .",
    "these conclusions are further reinforced from figures ( [ fig1]b ) and ( [ fig1]c ) wherein we have plotted @xmath98 versus @xmath95 and @xmath98 versus @xmath96 respectively . both the figures also indicate that the plotted parameter space does not include simultaneously the experimental bounds of the sines of the plotted angles .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that inverted hierarchy is ruled out for texture 6 zero neutrino mass matrices .",
    "coming to the two cases of fritzsch - like texture 5 zero mass matrices , we first discuss the case when @xmath24 and @xmath99 .",
    "primarily to facilitate comparison with texture 6 zero case , in figure ( [ nhih5zdn ] ) we have plotted @xmath100 against @xmath101 for inverted hierarchy for a particular value of @xmath102 .",
    "the figure clearly reveals that inverted hierarchy is ruled out as again the plotted parameter space has no overlap with the experimental @xmath94 c.l .",
    "ranges of @xmath100 and @xmath103 .    for the second case of texture 5 zero mass matrices pertaining to @xmath26 and @xmath104 case , one can again plot figures similar to the ones shown in figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ nhih5zdn ] ) .",
    "interestingly , these graphs are essentially similar as shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) , therefore these are not presented here .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that there is a very strong hierarchy in the case of charged leptons which reduces the texture 5 zero @xmath26 case essentially to texture 6 zero case only . by similar arguments",
    ", this case can also be therefore ruled out for inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "the cases of neutrino masses being degenerate , characterized by either @xmath105 or @xmath106 corresponding to normal and inverted hierarchy respectively , can again be shown to be ruled out .",
    "for texture 6 zero and 5 zero mass matrices considering degenerate scenario corresponding to inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses , figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ nhih5zdn ] ) can again be used to rule it out at 3@xmath97 c.l .. while plotting these figures the range of the lightest neutrino mass is taken to be @xmath86 , which includes the neutrino masses corresponding to degenerate scenario , therefore by discussion similar to the one given for ruling out inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses is ruled out as well .",
    "coming to the degenerate scenario corresponding to normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , one can show that this is ruled out as well . to this end , for texture 6 zero mass matrices in figure ( [ degm1]a ) we have plotted the mixing angle @xmath95 against the lightest neutrino mass @xmath68 . from the figure one can find that the values of @xmath95 corresponding to @xmath107 lie outside the experimentally allowed range , thereby ruling out degenerate scenario .",
    "for the texture 5 zero mass matrices , pertaining to @xmath24 case , the degenerate scenario corresponding to normal hierarchy of neutrino masses can again be shown to be ruled out .",
    "similar to the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices figure ( [ degm1]b ) again shows that the values of @xmath95 corresponding to @xmath108 lie outside the experimentally allowed range . for the @xmath109=0 case of texture 5 zero mass matrices",
    "again one gets essentially the same figures as for the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices therefore degenerate scenario for this case can be ruled out by similar arguments .        to begin with",
    ", we have made an attempt to reproduce the results of fsty @xcite for texture 6 zero lepton mass matrices .",
    "using the latest inputs we are largely able to reproduce their results .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we have presented our results pertaining to effective majorana mass measured in neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath110 , given as m_ee = m__1 u_e1 ^ 2 + m__2 u_e2 ^ 2 + m__3 u_e3 ^ 2 . [ m6 ]    in particular , in figure ( [ mee6 ] ) we have plotted the variation of @xmath111 with respect to the mixing angle @xmath101 . from the figure it is clear that there is a good overlap between the present calculations and the results of fsty .    as an extension of the analysis of fsty for the texture 6 zero lepton mass matrices for normal hierarchy of neutrino masses , in figures ( [ degm1]a ) and [ nhih6z](a , b ) we have respectively plotted the lightest neutrino mass @xmath112 against the mixing angles @xmath113 and @xmath114 . while plotting any of these graphs , the other input parameters have been given variations at @xmath115 c.l .. it may be noted that the plot between @xmath116 and @xmath112 , figure ( [ nhih6z]b ) expectedly does not provide any constrains on the range of @xmath85 considered here .",
    "similarly , considering the @xmath115 c.l .",
    "range of @xmath101 we do not get any reasonable constrains on @xmath112 , however , interestingly because of the almost precise value of @xmath117 even at @xmath115 c.l . we get a narrow range of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath112=0.03 - 0.07 ev . from figures ( [ degm1]a ) and ( [ nhih6z]a )",
    "one finds that for 1@xmath97 c.l .",
    "experimental ranges of @xmath95 and @xmath103 we get the range of @xmath112 to be 0.03 - 0.06 ev and 0.007 - 0.3 ev respectively . it may be noted that any measurement regarding the lightest neutrino mass @xmath112 will have immediate implications for texture 6 zero mass matrices considered here .      in the case of texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices , we have carried out calculations for both the cases when @xmath24 with @xmath118 and @xmath26 with @xmath104 . since the texture 6 zero mass matrices are able to accommodate the lepton mixing data quite well ,",
    "it is therefore expected that both the cases of texture 5 zero mass matrices would also be viable .",
    "similar to the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices , we would like to study the implications of the mixing angles on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath112 , in particular that of @xmath119 .",
    "we first discuss the case when @xmath24 and @xmath118 . for normal hierarchy of neutrino masses ,",
    "the additional parameter @xmath120 can be constrained such that the diagonalizing transformations @xmath121 and @xmath88 always remain real . primarily to facilitate comparison with texture 6 zero case , in figures ( [ degm1]b ) and ( [ nhih5z ] )",
    "we have plotted the mixing angles against the lightest neutrino mass for normal hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "interestingly , we find that this case shows a big change in the behaviour of the mixing angles @xmath103 and @xmath114 versus the lightest neutrino mass as compared to the texture 6 zero graphs shown in figure ( [ nhih6z ] ) .",
    "it may be noted that similar to the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices , @xmath103 and @xmath114 are not able to constrain the lightest neutrino mass @xmath112 at @xmath115 c.l .. however at @xmath122 c.l .",
    ", @xmath103 constrains the range of @xmath112 to be 0.007 - 0.03 ev .",
    "similar to the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices , the present refined value of @xmath123 , even at @xmath115 c.l .",
    ", provides the range of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath112 as 0.03 - 0.08 ev , which is somewhat expanded in the present case as compared to texture 6 zero mass matrices .",
    "this can be clearly understood by noting the fact that @xmath24 and @xmath124 case introduces additional parameters .",
    "it may be added that on comparison with our earlier analysis @xcite which was carried out when only an upper bound on @xmath96 was known , we find that the present experimental range of @xmath96 has sharpened the range of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath125 .    as a next step , similar to the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices , in figure ( [ mee5 ] ) we have shown the variation of the mixing angle @xmath101 against the effective majorana mass @xmath111 .",
    "one finds that the @xmath122 c.l .",
    "range of the mixing angle @xmath119 constrains the value of @xmath111 to be 2.3 - 8.7 mev , this being broadly in agreement with @xcite . due to the additional parameter",
    "@xmath126 the range obtained here also shows an expansion in comparison to the one obtained in the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices .",
    "it may be of interest to mention that the jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter in the leptonic sector @xmath127 @xcite spans the range -4.23 @xmath128 .",
    "coming to the second case of texture 5 zero mass matrices where @xmath26 and @xmath104 , the plots of the mixing angles against the lightest neutrino mass are shown in figure ( [ nhih55z ] ) .",
    "interestingly these graphs are very similar to those in figure ( [ nhih6z ] ) corresponding to the texture 6 zero case .",
    "this can again be understood by noting the fact that there is very strong hierarchy in the case of charged leptons which reduces the texture 5 zero @xmath26 case essentially to the texture 6 zero case .",
    "also we would like to mention that out of the two free parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the parameter @xmath23 plays a more important role than @xmath22 .",
    "this becomes more clear if we compare the graphs of the texture 6 zero matrices with those of the two cases of the texture 5 zero matrices .",
    "the texture 6 zero plots and those of the texture 5 zero @xmath26 case are essentially similar whereas those of the texture 5 zero @xmath24 case , wherein @xmath23 is non zero , are different from the graphs of the texture 6 zero matrices .    in this case also we present the viable range of jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter in the leptonic sector @xmath127 which is predicted to be -4.11 @xmath129 .",
    "the @xmath111 range comes out to be 2.4 - 6.02 mev which includes the range obtained in texture 6 zero case given as 3.7 - 5.6 mev . in the absence of any definite information about @xmath127 and @xmath111",
    "we find that the ranges corresponding to different cases are in broad agreement with the similar calculations done by several other authors @xcite .",
    "before summarizing the present work , a few comments are in order .",
    "it may be mentioned that in the case when charged leptons are in the flavor basis , the mixing matrix becomes much more simplified and one can easily deduce the consequences for different hierarchies of neutrino masses for the texture 6 zero as well as texture 5 zero mass matrices .",
    "further , it may be added that the ranges of @xmath130 and @xmath131 taken here , suggest that the present mass matrices can be considered as ` natural ' as advocated by peccei and wang @xcite .",
    "this analysis also brings forth an important point that even though the neutrino mixing pattern is very different from the quark mixing pattern , yet both can be described by ` natural ' texture specific mass matrices .    to summarize , as a first step",
    "we have extended the very recent analysis of fsty @xcite regarding compatibility of texture 6 zero hermitian lepton mass matrices with the leptonic mixing data .",
    "apart from reproducing their results we have been able to clearly rule out inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses in texture 6 zero mass matrices .",
    "further , keeping in mind quark - lepton universality @xcite , in the present work we have carried out the analysis for the texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices also as these are not ruled out in the case of quarks , unlike the case of texture 6 zero fritzsch - like and non fritzsch - like quark mass matrices .",
    "interestingly , again inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario of neutrino masses for texture 5 zero mass matrices also seem to be ruled out .",
    "the present analysis indicates that the present @xmath115 c.l .",
    "range of @xmath3 does not put a reasonable constraint on the value of lightest neutrino mass @xmath1 , therefore , refinements of its value will have important implications for @xmath85 .",
    "regarding , the effective majorana mass @xmath8 , one finds that for texture 5 zero lepton mass matrices when @xmath24 and @xmath118 the @xmath122 c.l .",
    "range of the mixing angle @xmath119 constrains the value of @xmath2 to be 2.3 - 8.7 mev .",
    "this range looks to be somewhat expanded in comparison to the one obtained in the case of texture 6 zero mass matrices due to the additional parameter @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , it seems that measurements of @xmath112 and @xmath111 would have important implications on texture specific mass matrices considered here .",
