    "debris disks , which are found around main sequence stars , contain little or no primordial material .",
    "instead , they are composed of recently produced secondary material generated by collisions between and evaporation of planetesimals , analogs of solar system asteroids and comets .",
    "terrestrial planet formation may be occurring in the younger debris disks , while the older ones seem to correspond to the `` clearing out '' stage early in the history of the solar system , during which most left - over planetesimals are removed from the system .",
    "impacts by water - rich planetesimals probably delivered most of the earth s surface volatiles during the clearing phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "gas in debris disks is generally hard to detect .",
    "only one bona fide debris disk , 49  ceti , shows any trace of sub - mm co emission @xcite , indicating that debris disk gas abundances are low relative to those in primordial and transitional disks .",
    "it appears that primordial molecular gas left over from star formation has largely dissipated by the debris disk phase",
    ". however , sensitive uv / optical absorption spectroscopy has revealed small amounts of secondary gas in a few debris disks : @xmath2  pictoris ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 51  ophiuchi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath3  herculis @xcite , and hd  32297 @xcite .",
    "the gas seen is primarily atomic .",
    "the primary production mechanisms for secondary gas in debris disks are currently unknown , but may include photon - stimulated desorption from circumstellar ( cs ) dust grains @xcite and/or grain - grain collisions @xcite",
    ".    is the only debris disk whose gas is well - characterized . in this disk ,",
    "most measured gaseous elements have roughly solar composition relative to each other @xcite .",
    "the exception is carbon , which is extremely overabundant relative to every other measured element ( e.g.  c@xmath4o @xmath5 solar ) .",
    "this discovery was surprising , since the central star has solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the carbon overabundance suggests that a previously unsuspected  and currently unknown  process is operating in the disk , during which the planetesimals preferentially lose volatile carbonaceous material .",
    "however , the lack of similar abundance information for other debris disks renders interpretation of the @xmath2  pic  results difficult .",
    "detections of gas in debris disks to date have almost exclusively used optical or uv absorption spectroscopy of edge - on disks .",
    "such observations are sensitive to very small amounts of cold gas .",
    "unfortunately , the geometric constraint that the line of sight to the central star must pass through the disk severely limits the number of disks that may be probed for gas in this way .",
    "there is a strong need for additional debris disks in which gas can be observed , in order to study the evolution of gas abundance and composition throughout the entire planet formation phase .",

    "most shell stars are b- or a - type . in some cases",
    ", the narrow lines may arise from interstellar ( is ) material , although the fact that the gas is at the velocity of the star makes this interpretation less likely .",
    "in addition , the absorption lines are generally stronger than can be readily explained by is gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the shell stars have high projected rotational velocities compared to non - shell early - type stars , showing that gas is more likely to be detected when the line of sight intersects the rotational plane of the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that the gas is usually confined to that plane and strengthens the case for a cs rather than is origin of most shell absorption lines .",
    "many shell stars appear to be rapidly rotating evolved stars that have recently ejected mass from their equatorial planes .",
    "however , @xcite evaluated the luminosity classes of 57 shell stars and found that 40% of them are main sequence stars .",

    "the observations were designed to probe sensitively for excess flux arising from cs dust . the goal is to assemble a unique and valuable set of debris disk systems where the gas may be studied in as much detail as the dust .",
    "we began our target selection by considering which subset of the 57 shell stars in @xcite is the most likely to contain debris disks . to eliminate evolved stars",
    ", we selected only the stars with luminosity class  v ( 23 stars ) .",
    "we then eliminated six stars already known to have protoplanetary or debris disks .",
    "we also wanted to eliminate ordinary stars that might have been misclassified as shell stars simply because they have anomalously large amounts of is material along their lines of sight .",
    "therefore , we discarded stars that are outside of the local interstellar bubble ( lib ) , using the lib size and shape from @xcite .",
    "this left us with 12 stars ( listed in table  [ tab : targets ] ) .",
    "to this set , we added four shell stars whose spectra show narrow , time - variable absorption features .",
    "these are hd  42111 @xcite , hd  50241 @xcite , hd  148283 @xcite , and hd  217782 @xcite .",
    "the time - variability confirms that the gas along the lines of sight to these stars is cs , despite the fact that one of them is outside the lib .",
    "such behavior is seen in spectra of @xmath2  pic , and is caused by evaporation of star - grazing planetesimals passing through the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the panels on the right show portions of the two stars seds , with the best - fitting upper limit sed models for four values of @xmath143 overplotted . the @xmath144",
    "upper limits decrease sharply with increasing temperature between 20  k and about 50  k. this is because we do not have photometry at longer wavelengths , which would constrain the fitting of seds with cold blackbody temperatures . as @xmath143 increases ,",
    "the @xmath144  upper limits increase then decrease , forming an absolute maximum ( e.g.  hd  217782 ) or local maximum ( e.g.  hd  77190 ) somewhere between @xmath168  k and @xmath169  k. the @xmath144  upper limits then gradually increase again .",
    "the maximum between @xmath168  k and @xmath169  k occurs at the temperature of the best - fitting sed model found if one treats a 70  @xmath0  upper limit as a detection ( see the right - hand panels of figure  [ fig : upper ] ) .",
    "however , for five of the stars without significant excesses ( including hd  77190 ) , the largest @xmath144  upper limit occurs at 300  k ( see the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : upper ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "sed models with fairly high blackbody temperatures are consistent with the limits imposed by the 12  @xmath0  and 24  @xmath0  fluxes , indicating that the sed fitting is also poorly constrained at shorter mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in table  [ tab : seds ] .",
    "for the stars without significant ir excess , the @xmath144  upper limit given is valid for all blackbody temperatures between 50  k and 300  k.",
    "this first survey for debris disks around main sequence shell stars was successful ; 4 out of the 16 stars we observed with mips show ir excess emission at 24  @xmath0  and 70  @xmath0 .",
    "the dust temperatures from simple modeling of their seds are cool , similar to those of other debris disks .",
    "these candidate debris disks have best - fitting @xmath144  values that are about 30 to 100 times lower than that of @xmath2  pic .",
    "the mid - ir excesses of these four stars do not resemble those of classical be stars , whose mid - ir fluxes observed with _ spitzer _  show a steep power - law decline with increasing wavelength ( see figure  6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the stars with excesses",
    ", we calculated the distances from the central stars of grains with these temperatures , assuming blackbody grains and 1  @xmath0-size astronomical silicate grains .",
    "the distance calculated assuming blackbody grains represents a minimum distance , while the one calculated assuming silicate grains is probably more accurate .",
    "the values appear in table  [ tab : seds ] . for hd  21620 , hd  118232 , and hd  158352",
    ", the calculated distances suggest that their cs dust lies in the kuiper belt region for an a - star @xcite .",
    "the dust around hd  142926 is somewhat warmer , and may lie closer to the central star .    we have searched the literature for information on the ages of our debris disk candidates .",
    "hd  21620 is a member of the @xmath7  per open cluster , which indicates that it is about 80  myr old .",
    "this age is fairly young compared to most debris disks , whose ages range from @xmath170  myr ( e.g.  @xmath2  pic ) to more than 1  gyr .",
    "we were not able to find any published age estimate for hd  118232 . in a future paper",
    ", we will estimate the age of this star using multiple age - dating techniques .",
    "an estimate of the age of hd  142926 appears in @xcite . in this paper , the ages of be stars were determined by comparing their positions on the h - r diagram to theoretical tracks of the evolution of rapidly rotating stars from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to the terminal - age main sequence ( tams ) and beyond into the post - main sequence phases . @xcite estimate the age of hd  142926 to be about 78  myr old , which is @xmath171 of the star s total main sequence lifetime .",
    "based on the _ iras _",
    "fluxes from hd  158352 , @xcite tentatively suggested that it has an ir excess . a new analysis of the _ iras _  data by mor et al .",
    "( 2006 ) reaffirmed this suggestion , which is now confirmed by our mips photometry .",
    "hd  158352 is not known to be a member of any young moving group .",
    "its age is estimated to be @xmath172  myr , based on the star s location on the h - r diagram relative to theoretical isochrones ( mor et al .",
    "the ir excess from this star is anomalously large given its presumed advanced age . in a recent _ spitzer _  mips survey for excesses from nearby main sequence early - type stars , there are no stars older than about 300  myr that show as large a 24  @xmath0  excess as hd  158352 @xcite .",
    "we here discuss two particular stars from our survey that do not have significant ir excesses .",
    "hd  50241 ( @xmath7  pic ) does not show significant excess emission at either mips wavelength , although a claim for ir excess from this star has been made based on its fluxes from _ iras _",
    "this star is often used as a point - spread function reference for coronagraphic imaging of the @xmath2  pic  debris disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is fortunate that it does not have a large amount of cs dust .",
    "there has been a claim for star - grazing planetesimals around hd  217782 @xcite , which would make it a true @xmath2  pic  analog .",
    "however , the lack of a significant amount of cs dust near the star argues against this scenario .",
    "the process that is thought to give rise to the large numbers of star - grazing planetesimals in the @xmath2  pic  system , gravitational perturbation by an unseen giant planet @xcite , would also be expected to cause dust - producing collisions between planetesimals .",
    "the time - variable , narrow absorption lines seen in spectra of hd  217782 seem to require a different explanation .",
    "none of the four stars in our sample with claims for variable cs gas showed significant ir excess emission .",
    "@xcite found the same result using _ spitzer _",
    "observations of three other stars with variable cs gas .",
    "the origin of time - variable , narrow absorption lines in spectra of main sequence early - type stars is a topic we plan to investigate further .",
    "we surveyed 12 out of the 23 main sequence shell stars compiled in @xcite .",
    "six of the 23 were already known to harbor debris disks or younger protoplanetary disks ( mwc  480 , @xmath2  pic , hd  97048 , hd  139614 , hd  163296 , & hd  179218 ) ; these stars were observed in other _ spitzer",
    "_  programs .",
    "the remaining 5 stars were not observed in our program because they lie outside the lib .",
    "however , one of them ( hd  144667 ) is an accreting herbig  ae star , which very likely has a protoplanetary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we consider that there were 7 known protoplanetary or debris disks in the @xcite sample of main sequence shell stars prior to our _ spitzer _  survey .",
    "we found four additional disk candidates among the 12 main sequence shell stars from @xcite that we observed .",
    "therefore , the disk fraction among the @xcite main sequence shell stars appears to be at least 11 out of 23 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have no information about the presence of disks around four of the 23 stars ; therefore , the disk fraction in this set of stars could be as high as @xmath173 .    at this time",
    ", we are not able to properly compare the disk fraction among the main sequence shell stars to the disk fraction in other sets of early - type stars .",
    "the disk fraction is higher for young early - type stars than it is for early - type stars with ages @xmath174  myr @xcite .",
    "therefore , when comparing the disk fraction in different sets of stars , the sets should have similar distributions of stellar ages .",
    "we do not currently know the age distribution in the @xcite main sequence shell star set , although we plan to estimate the stellar ages using multiple techniques in a future paper .",
    "we have found four debris disk candidates in our _ spitzer _  survey of 16 main sequence shell stars .",
    "these stars show ir excess emission characteristic of moderate amounts of cool cs dust .",
    "we have begun follow - up observations of all of our shell stars , to more fully characterize their cs material .",
    "based on their seds , it seems likely that our candidates will be confirmed as debris disks .",
    "if so , they are likely to be edge - on , which is the most advantageous orientation for coronagraphic imaging of a disk",
    ". these disk candidates will likely double the number of debris disks with currently detectable cs gas . with this sample",
    ", we may begin a program to determine why some debris disks have both gas and dust and how these different components are related .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the nature of the main sequence shell stars has been something of a puzzle .",
    "our _ spitzer _  study suggests that at least half of the stars in this class have protoplanetary or debris disks .",
    "surveys for shell stars using ground - based optical spectroscopy , followed by ir photometry to look for cs dust , may be an effective way of finding protoplanetary and debris disks .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
