    "theory of nucleon transfer reaction formulated in terms of the matrix element containing the potential transition operator is based on the perturbation approach over the potential transition operator .",
    "it can be formulated in two forms : post or prior . in the post ( prior ) form the initial ( final ) scattering wave function is approximated by a simpler channel wave function .",
    "the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) , which is the simplest approach , is the first order perturbation theory over the potential transition operator ( which is different in the post and prior forms ) sandwiched by the initial and final channel wave functions .",
    "these channel wave functions are given by a product of bound state wave function of the the initial ( final nuclei ) multiplied by a corresponding distorted wave .",
    "the dwba is based on the assumption that probability of direct reactions is so small that they can be treated as direct transition from the initial to final channel without any coupling to the other channels , what is not always true .",
    "a definite improvement is continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) method applied for the analysis of the deuteron stripping . in cdcc , in addition to @xmath3 channel , the three - body breakup channel @xmath4 is included .",
    "however , the cdcc has its own limitations .",
    "the main one is related with the contribution of the rearrangement channels .",
    "for example , for deuteron stripping these rearrangement channels are the proton or neutron bound to the target . because rearrangement channels are not orthogonal to the initial @xmath5 channel and to the breakup @xmath6 channel , their accurate inclusion makes the problem very complicated and the only legitimate solution is the faddeev formalism @xcite , which allows one to treat consistently non - orthogonal channels without double counting .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to use the faddeev formalism on a routine basis and its application , owing to the technical problems with the coulomb interaction , is limited only to light nuclei .",
    "hence cdcc is still useful , but one needs to clearly understand the shortcomings of the cdcc and one of them is the absence of the rearrangement channels in the asymptotic regions .    in practical calculations",
    "it is assumed that in a limited region near the target the cdcc wave function reproduces the three - body wave function reasonably well . to calculate the stripping matrix element the standard iteration procedure is used :",
    "the cdcc wave function does not have rearrangement channels in the asymptotic region but can be used to calculate the reaction matrix element contributed by the final volume around the target . here",
    "the question of the uniqueness appears : how the solution of the cdcc equation would change if we add the rearrangement channel wave function to the original cdcc wave function .",
    "for example , if we consider the deuteron stripping reaction @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , what would happen if we use @xmath9 as the initial wave function rather than just the cdcc wave function @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 bound state wave function and @xmath13 is the @xmath14 distorted wave . it was shown in @xcite that the presence of two optical potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 suppresses the contribution from two rearrangement channels , @xmath17 and @xmath18 resolving the uniqueness problem . however , if only one optical potential is present , then the issue of uniqueness should be checked . to suppress the rearrangement channels truncation over angular momentum is being used .",
    "then a sensitivity to the maximal orbital angular momentum of the relative motion of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 should be checked .    despite the shortcomings of the cdcc approach it remains the best option unless the faddeev equations are solved . in this work",
    "we use the cdcc approach to develop the theory of the deuteron stripping to resonance states .",
    "however , instead of the standard formulation of the theory with the matix element expressed in terms of the volume integral we develop here the theory of the deuteron stripping based on the surface - integral formalism @xcite and cdcc approach .",
    "the first such attempt has been done in a recent work @xcite , where both dwba and cdcc method were used to derive the deuteron stripping reaction amplitude populating bound states and resonances . however , the cdcc part was not complete because the surface integral was extended to the region where the cdcc method fails . here",
    "we present another formulation of the theory of the stripping to resonance states using the surface integral formulation based on the cdcc approach in a finite region around the target , that is in the region where cdcc should work . in @xcite",
    "the surface integral in the post form for stripping to bound states was taken over variable @xmath2 while the volume integral over the second jacobian variable @xmath22 was taken over the whole space . now in our new formulation the matrix element is expressed in terms of the surface integral over @xmath22 at some finite @xmath23 determined by the transition operator , while the volume integral over the second jacobian variable @xmath2 is taken over the limited volume space because of the presence of the bound state wave function @xmath11 .",
    "we also use the prior form for the analysis of the stripping to resonance states . in this case",
    "the matrix element can be expressed in terms of surface integral over @xmath24 taken at some finite radius determined by the transition operator and the bound state wave function @xmath25 and the volume integral over the second jacobian variable @xmath26 , which is taken over the limited volume because of the presence of @xmath25 .",
    "thus even for stripping to resonance the matrix element is taken over the limited space where cdcc works .",
    "we explore different choices of the channel wave functions and , correspondingly , different transition operators .",
    "one of the main unsolved problems in the conventional theory for the deuteron stripping reaction @xmath7 is the inconsistency in the treatment of the @xmath1 potential , which should be real to support the final bound or resonance state @xmath27 but complex to describe the initial @xmath1 scattering . we show how this inconsistency leads to the appearance of the auxiliary term when connecting the conventional volume matrix element with the surface integral form .",
    "we also present calculations using the fresco code @xcite for stripping to bound states and resonances .",
    "the main goal of this work is to present an advanced theory of the deuteron stripping to a resonance , which further leads to the three - body continuum in the final state .",
    "such reactions can occur in broad interval of the deuteron incident energies .",
    "note that the deuteron stripping to resonance requires @xmath28 mev , the deuteron binding energy , to break the deuteron and additional energy to excite a resonance state .",
    "hence the @xmath29 value of the reaction is negative .",
    "that is why we do not consider here deuteron stripping at sub - coulomb energies with new interesting physics @xcite .",
    "such reactions can be studied using the faddeev formalism .",
    "the theory , which we present here , is aimed to analyze the deuteron stripping reactions from low energies near the coulomb barrier up to the deuteron incident energies @xmath30 mev .",
    "let us consider the deuteron stripping to bound states @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the bound state .",
    "the reaction amplitude can be calculated exactly in the three - body model using the faddeev integral equations in the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) form @xcite but it neglects internal degrees of freedom of the target or can only account for a few @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the formalism is limited to targets with not too large charges .",
    "nowadays , deuteron stripping on heavy nuclei with atomic number @xmath33 are the most important and urgent because they can provide a missing vital information about @xmath34 s- or r - processes in stellar evolution .",
    "the generalized faddeev approach , which explicitly includes target excitations and the coulomb interaction for arbitrary charges , was developed @xcite but no computer codes based on the formalism are yet available . besides , the faddeev formalism is too complicated for use on an everyday basis , especially by experimental groups .    in the traditional approach",
    "the reaction amplitude is calculated using the iteration procedure .",
    "in which the volume matrix element containing the exact scattering wave function ( in the initial state - post form or in the final state - prior form ) is approximated by the one , in which the exact scattering wave function is replaced by some model wave function .",
    "this approximation is used because nowadays there are no tools to calculate the many - body scattering wave function accurately , especially in the asymptotic regions with many open channels .",
    "moreover , should this asymptotic behavior be available there is no need to calculate the matrix elements because the amplitude of the asymptotic outgoing wave in the corresponding channel is the reaction amplitude for transition to this channel .",
    "the idea of the iteration procedure is that the matrix element containing the scattering wave function , which is not accurate asymptotically , is still suited to calculate the reaction amplitude , because this matrix element is contributed by a limited volume around the target where the model scattering wave function may be accurate enough .",
    "first we consider the surface integral formalism in a three - body - model , in which all three particles are structureless and all the interaction potentials between them are real .",
    "after that we specifically consider deuteron stripping reactions extending the three - body model what requires using optical potentials .",
    "different options and ways how they affect the reaction amplitude will be discussed .",
    "we start from the consideration of reaction ( [ deutstrbndst1 ] ) in the three - body model @xmath35 .",
    "we introduce the jacobian variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 commonlly used to describe three - body systems , where @xmath38 is the radius - vector connecting the center of masses of particles @xmath39 and @xmath40 while @xmath41 is the radius - vector connecting the center of mass of particle @xmath42 and the center of mass of the system @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "also , we denote by @xmath53 the asymptotic region where all three particles are far away ( breakup channel ) , that is @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the asymptotic behavior of the three - body wave function of three charged particles in different asymptotic regions was discussed in @xcite . for the asymptotic behavior of the three - body wave function",
    "we have @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the scattering wave function with the incident wave in the initial channel @xmath42 .",
    "the two - cluster channel @xmath42 is defined as the channel @xmath58 , where the free particle carries the name of the channel .",

    ". however , its practical implementation in the many - body case , except for three- and four - body systems , is hardly yet possible , because contemporary microscopic methods fail to provide the correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "that is why , if we are not going to use the faddeev or faddeev - yakubovsli @xcite coupled equations , the conventional methods for the determination of reaction amplitudes is to calculate the volume matrix elements in the post or prior forms .",

    "we explored different choices of channel wave functions and transition operators and showed that the conventional cdcc volume matrix element can be written in terms of the surface - integral matrix element , which is peripheral , and the auxiliary matrix element , which determines the contribution of the nuclear interior over the variable @xmath0 .",
    "this auxiliary matrix element appears owing to the inconsistency in treating of the @xmath1 potential : this potential should be real in the final state to support bound states or resonance scattering and complex in the initial state to describe @xmath1 scattering .",

    "it is demonstrated that the conventional cdcc volume matrix element coincides with the surface matrix element , which converges for the stripping to the resonance state .",
    "also the surface representation ( over the variable @xmath2 ) of the stripping matrix element enhances the peripheral part of the amplitude although the internal contribution does nt disappear and increases with increase of the deuteron energy .",
    "although the code for the surface - integral formalism in the cdccc approach is not yet available , we presented many calculations corroborating our findings both for the stripping to the bound state and the resonance . for the stripping to the bound state we use @xmath657 at 23.4 and 60 mev of the deuteron incident energy",
    "it is shown how the contribution of the auxiliary term changes with energy .",
    "for the stripping to resonance state we explore @xmath603 reaction at @xmath604 mev . because the cdcc code for stripping to resonance is not yet available we use the ccba and demonstrate that the prior form converges while the post form oscillates even at large distances .",
    "we demonstrate how the resonance width can be extracted from the analysis of the deuteron stripping to the resonance state .",
    "here we show how the inconsistency in the treatment of the @xmath1 potential leads to the post - prior discrepancy of the dwba amplitude . to this end",

    "we note that in the proof of the equality of the post and prior forms we used the same @xmath311 potential both in the schrdinger equation for the final state bound state wave function and in the transition operator of the prior form .",
    "however , the often used global optical potential @xmath558 is contributed by both @xmath15 and @xmath16 optical potentials .",
    "similarly in the awba @xmath558 is given by the sum of @xmath666 with the @xmath186 optical potentials taken at half deuteron energy .",
    "if we adopt @xmath16 in the prior form transition operator rather than @xmath311 , then the post and prior form dwba amplitudes differ by the auxiliary amplitude@xmath667 where the prior dwba amplitude is given now by @xmath668 and @xmath669 in a modified prior dwba amplitude the transition operator contains the optical potential @xmath16 rather than the real potential @xmath311 in the conventional prior form ( [ postpriordwba1 ] ) .",
    "thus the post and prior dwba amplitudes differ if we replace @xmath311 by @xmath16 in the transition operator of the prior form , meaning that the inconsistency in the treatment of the @xmath1 potential leads to the post - prior discrepancy .",
