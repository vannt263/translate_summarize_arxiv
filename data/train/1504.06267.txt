    "the study of wave scattering in disordered media is an active field of research , stimulated both by innovative applications in imaging and sensing  @xcite and by fundamental questions in mesoscopic physics  @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", the possibility to control the propagation of optical waves in complex media in the multiple scattering regime has been demonstrated using wavefront shaping techniques  @xcite .",
    "this breakthrough offers new perspectives for imaging and communication through complex media  @xcite .",
    "the initial schemes make use of optimization techniques requiring intensity measurements in the transmitted speckle , which in terms of practical applications is a serious drawback .",
    "finding a way to control the transmission and focusing of light through a strongly scattering medium from measurements of the reflected speckle only is an issue of tremendous importance .",
    "progresses have been made recently by taking advantage of the memory effect  @xcite , with imaging capabilities limited to relatively small optical thicknesses .",
    "nevertheless , the connection between the reflected and the transmitted speckle patterns generated by a disordered medium in the multiple scattering regime has not been addressed theoretically so far .    in this paper",
    ", we make a step in this direction by studying theoretically and numerically the statistical correlation between the intensities measured in the transmitted and the reflected speckle patterns .",
    "the spatial intensity correlation function @xmath0 is defined as @xmath1 where the notation @xmath2 denotes a statistical average over disorder and @xmath3 is the intensity fluctuation .",
    "this correlation function has been extensively studied in the context of wave scattering and mesoscopic physics  @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches often make use of the canonical slab or waveguide geometries ( for a review see  @xcite and references therein ) , where either transmitted or reflected intensity is considered , or consider point sources in an infinite or open medium and compute intensity correlations for two points inside or outside the medium  @xcite .",
    "it seems that the intensity correlation function for two points lying on different sides of a slab medium has not been studied , and that the existence of a correlation has only been mentionned through passing  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we study the correlation between the intensities in the input and output planes of a strongly scattering slab , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ schema ] . using numerical simulations and analytical calculations ,",
    "we show that for optically thick slabs a correlation persists and takes negative values",
    ". moreover , at smaller optical thicknesses , short and long - range correlations coexist , with relative weights that depend on the optical thickness .",
    "we believe these results to be a step forward for the control of transmission through strongly scattering media , thus finding applications in sensing , imaging and information transfer .",
    "the spatial intensity correlation in a speckle pattern can be split into three contributions , historically denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite , as follows : @xmath7 the first term @xmath4 corresponds to the gaussian statistics approximation for the field amplitude , and is a short - range contribution , whose width determines the average size of a speckle spot  @xcite . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are non - gaussian long - range correlations that decay on much larger scales  @xcite . in the diffusive regime , and for two observation points lying on the same side of the scattering medium , these three contributions have different weights such that @xmath8 . in the reflection / transmission configuration considered here , and at large optical thickness , we show that an intensity correlation persists and is dominated by @xmath5 because of the short - range behavior of @xmath4 . in this case",
    ", the long - range character of @xmath5 is confered by its algebraic decay with respect to the distance between the two observation points .",
    "moreover , this correlation is negative , a result that may have implications in the context of wave control by wavefront shaping . for smaller optical thicknesses ,",
    "we also show that a crossover can be found between regimes dominated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ correlation_large_b ]",
    ", we study the reflection / transmission correlation function at large optical thicknesses .",
    "first , we use numerical simulations to compute the correlation function without approximation and to describe its main features .",
    "second , we present the analytical calculation of the @xmath5 contribution to the reflection / transmission correlation function in the multiple scattering regime , for both two - dimensional and three - dimensional geometries , and show that @xmath5 is the leading contribution at large optical thicknesses . in section  [ correlation_small_b ] , we study the correlation function at small optical thicknesses , a regime in which the @xmath4 contribution dominates . in section",
    "[ stats ] , as a consequence of the negative value of the correlation that is found in the multiple scattering regime , we describe some peculiarities of the statistical distribution of reflected / transmitted intensities .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we summarize the main results and discuss some implications for the control of wave transmission through disordered media .",
    "in this section we present exact numerical simulations of wave scattering in the multiple scattering regime .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a 2d geometry for the sake of computer memory and time .",
    "we consider a slab of scattering material , characterized by its thickness @xmath9 and its transverse size @xmath10 ( we keep @xmath11 in order to avoid finite size effects ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",

    "we consider scatterers at resonance ( @xmath24 ) in order to reach large optical thicknesses with a reasonable number of scatterers ( typically a few hundreds ) . in the coupled dipoles formalism , the exciting field @xmath25 on scatterer number @xmath26",
    "is written as  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the 2d free - space green function given by @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the hankel function of first kind and order zero .",
    "equation ( [ linear_system ] ) defines a set of @xmath17 linear equations that are solved by a standard matrix inversion procedure .",
    "once the exciting field is known on each scatterer , the field @xmath31 and the intensity @xmath32 at any position @xmath33 inside or outside the scattering medium can be calculated by a direct summation , using @xmath34      we have carried out numerical simulations in the multiple scattering regime with an optical thickness @xmath35 .",
    "this choice of optical thickness is limited by the number of configurations that can be calculated in a reasonable computer time in order to get a sufficiently accurate statistics to compute averaged values ( requiring typically @xmath36 configurations ) .",

    "this means that @xmath45 , showing that the probability to have a dark spot in the transmitted speckle in lateral coincidence with a bright spot in the reflection speckle ( and _ vice - versa _ ) should be substantial .",
    "this property , that might have implications for the control of wave transmission by wavefront shaping , is investigated more precisely in section  [ stats ] .      to get more insight on the numerical result presented above , we present the calculation of the @xmath5 contribution to the intensity correlation function for scalar waves in both two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) geometries . intuitively , we expected @xmath5 to be the leading contribution at large optical thicknesses , since @xmath6 is always negligible compared to @xmath5 and @xmath4 vanishes exponentially with the optical thickness in this particular reflection / transmission configuration .    for a dilute system such that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 with @xmath48 the speed of light and @xmath49 the wavelength in vacuum , the intensity correlation functions can be calculated analytically using a perturbative approach .",
    "since the calculation for reflection - reflection or transmission - transmission correlations is detailed in textbooks or review articles  @xcite , we do not give all details here but rather focus on the specificity of the reflection - transmission geometry .",
    "for the analytical derivation , we consider that the transverse size @xmath10 of the slab is infinite .",
