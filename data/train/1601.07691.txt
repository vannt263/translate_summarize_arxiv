    "to date , general relativity ( gr ) has passed all experimental and observational tests in the weak - field and non - relativistic regimes .",
    "nonetheless , the following issues motivate us to study modified gravity ( mg ) theories : the first one is the fundamental theoretical one that quantizes gravity and unifies it with other interactions ; see @xcite for related work in the context of gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "the second one is the black hole singularity , which appears unavoidably in gr .",
    "thus , gr is expected to be broken down at the singularity ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for related work in the context of gw ) .",
    "the third one is the current cosmic acceleration discovered with the observation of type ia supernovae , which may suggest the existence of dark energy  @xcite .",
    "this is supported by the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies  @xcite and the large - scale structure of galaxies  @xcite . however , the nature of dark energy is still unknown , and it may also suggest a sign of breakdown of gr on a cosmologically large scale ( see the reviews in  @xcite for details ) . it is thus important to experimentally test gr more precisely .",
    "advanced ligo has detected two gravitational wave events from binary black hole mergers during its first observation run  @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests that advanced ligo  @xcite and the coming advanced virgo  @xcite and kagra  @xcite will observe a lot of similar gw events when these detectors are in full operation .",
    "these observations will give us a great opportunity to test gr through comparison of observed gravitational waveforms with the predictions  @xcite .",
    "we might encounter breakdown of gr in strong - field and dynamical regimes in the coming gw observations .",
    "they would provide us with lots of important clues to construct a correct theory of gravity that overcomes the above problems .",
    "it is thus important to quantify what deviations from gr can be detected by the coming gw observations .    the second - generation ground - based laser interferometer is sensitive to gravitational waves in the frequency band between @xmath0 and a few @xmath1 .",
    "the gws emitted during the inspiral phase of coalescing compact binary ( ccb ) systems are one of the most promising sources for these detectors , which will be able to detect the gws from ccb systems , composed of neutron stars ( nss ) and/or black holes ( bhs ) , within a few @xmath2 or a few @xmath3 .    the inspiral phase of ccb systems is well understood thanks to the post - newtonian ( pn ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "therefore , gw observations of the inspiral signals emitted from ccb systems can be a powerful probe of the strong - field , dynamical aspect of gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "it is extremely instructive to contrast predictions of parameterized deviations from gr .",
    "for example , the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism has been used for weak - field tests of gravity  @xcite .",
    "many previous works take a model - independent approach to the strong - field test of gravity for the coming gw observations ( see the reviews in  @xcite of gw tests of gravity ) . in the pn formalism",
    ", the amplitude and the orbital phase of the inspiral signal are expanded in powers of @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a characteristic velocity  @xcite .",
    "a test of gr could take the form of modifying the pn phasing coefficients , called parameterized tests of post - newtonian theory ( ptpn )  @xcite .",
    "a general algorithm for testing gr , called tiger ( test infrastructure for general relativity ) , was developed , based on bayesian model selection  @xcite . given the data containing the inspiral signal , one compares the bayesian evidence for the gr hypothesis against the mg hypothesis in which one or more phasing coefficients in the pn formula are modified .",
    "yunes and pretorius have developed the parameterized post - einsteinian ( ppe ) formalism , which is a similar but more general approach than the ptpn , covering a large class of parameterized deviations  @xcite . in  @xcite , the authors have shown that lower - pn corrections in the phase have been strongly constrained with the observation of the orbital period decay of the binary pulsar @xmath6 . in  @xcite , the authors have evaluated the parameter estimation accuracy of the ppe phasing parameters for observations with advanced ligo / advanced virgo and lisa detections by using the markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "their results have shown that gw constraints are stronger than those of binary pulsar observations at higher pn order .",
    "there have been many other works which used the ppe formalism  @xcite .    to evaluate the parameter estimation accuracy , fisher information matrix analysis",
    "has often been used  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "bayesian hypothesis testing is also useful for model selection in the gw data analysis  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , vallisneri has proposed a simple approximate decision scheme for testing mg within the framework of bayesian hypothesis testing  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", one can easily evaluate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) required for detection of a given deviation from gr waveforms . in this method ,",
    "one only needs to compute the snr and a fitting factor ( ff ) , which are computationally cheaper than computing the full evidence for the detail of this scheme . ] .",
    "vallisneri s method is indeed useful to assess the detectability of mg signals .",
    "we have already demonstrated by using this method that there exist detectable regions of the bigravity parameters ( the graviton mass and the ratio between gravitational constants for two kinds of graviton ) , which characterize graviton oscillations , for a single observation of gw from ccb with an advanced ground - based gw detector  @xcite . for detection purposes ,",
    "one usually uses a gr waveform as a template for the matched filtering analysis .",
    "if gr happened to be broken in the strong - field regime , gr templates could still extract signals , but with the wrong values of the parameters .",
    "this is called fundamental bias  @xcite .",
    "if the deviations from gr are not large enough to be detectable and yet this systematic error is larger than the statistical uncertainties in parameter estimation , fundamental bias can be hidden , and becomes stealth bias . in  @xcite , vallisneri and yunes have investigated the stealth bias by using the vallisneri s method and have indicated that stealth bias could be a generic feature of gw observation , if gr is not correct in the strong - field regime .    in this paper , looking toward the full operation of advanced ground - based gw detectors , we explore the detectability of generic deviations of gravitational waveforms from ccbs by using the ppe formalism based on vallisneri s method .",
    "we consider non - spinning binary systems consisting of binary neutron stars ( bns ) , neutron star@xmath7black hole ( nsbh ) binaries , and binary black holes ( bbhs ) .",
    "we explore what deviations from gr waveforms are detectable .",
    "we also focus on what the effect of systematic bias is on the detectable region .",
    "we investigate the systematic bias  @xcite due to the neglect of spin  @xcite , orbital eccentricity  @xcite , and tidal deformation  @xcite on constraining generic deviations from gr waveforms .",
    "bayesian analysis has been performed  @xcite on testing gr with gws including spins and the ns finitesize effect .",
    "the authors of @xcite have studied the robustness of tiger against unknown fundamental , astrophysical , and instrumental effects .",
    "they concluded that the @xmath8 cutoff renders tidal effects up to 6pn order in phase invisible without affecting tiger s ability to look for gr violations .",
    "the authors of @xcite have studied the effect of aligned spins in the templates on the bayes factors between a 1pn ppe model and gr in the case when the signal is a ppe model without spin .",
    "they have shown that the degeneracy between the 1.5pn spin term and the 1pn ppe parameter significantly weakens the bounds . in this paper , we include higher pn order terms of spins , tidal deformations , and orbital eccentricity , and study the case when both signals and templates include these additional parameters .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ppe ] , we briefly review the ppe formalism and pn phase including corrections by spin , orbital eccentricity , and tidal deformation . in sect .",
    "[ sec : statistics ] , we briefly review gw data analysis for ccbs and vallisneri s method . in sect . [",
    "sec : result ] , we show the detectable region of the ppe parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the parameterized post - einsteinian ( ppe ) waveform , which has been proposed by arun _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and yunes and pretorius  @xcite .",
    "we consider the quasi - circular inspiral phase of gws from ccb systems . in this paper , we consider non - spinning binaries for simplicity .",
    "the gravitational waveforms received by the laser interferometer are described by using two polarizations of gws and the detector s antenna pattern function , which depends on the location of the source on the sky and the detector s location .",
    "since we consider detection with a single detector , we only need simplified forms of the waveform in which the detector s antenna pattern function and the inclination angle of the orbital plane are contained in the constant amplitude and phase .",
    "the inspiral waveform in gr is described in the frequency domain as @xmath9 where the amplitude @xmath10 ( up to newtonian order ) and the phase function @xmath11 are given as a series in the inspiral reduced frequency @xmath12 as , @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant determined by the sky location and the inclination angle , @xmath16 is the luminosity distance to the source , @xmath17 is the coalescence time , and @xmath18 is a constant phase term .",
    "@xmath19 is the chirp mass defined by the component masses , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , as @xmath22 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the component masses @xmath20 , @xmath21",
    ".    the ppe formalism has been formed by adding amplitude and phase corrections to the gr response function .",
    "the ppe inspiral waveform has the form  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 the ppe formalism is corrected by ppe amplitude and phase functions with free magnitude parameter @xmath27 and powers of the frequency @xmath28 in the amplitude , and free magnitude parameter @xmath29 and powers of the frequency @xmath30 in the phase .",
    "the @xmath31 term in the amplitude corresponds to relative @xmath32 pn order with respect to the leading gr terms , and the @xmath33 term corresponds to relative @xmath34 pn order , respectively .",
    "gr is recovered when @xmath35 .",
    "we restrict @xmath28 and @xmath30 to integer values since we consider circular orbits . in this paper , we consider the following two cases :    a.   amplitude corrections with @xmath36 $ ] corresponding to @xmath37 to 3  pn order",
    ". b.   phase corrections with @xmath38 $ ] corresponding to @xmath37 to 3.5  pn order .",
    "notice that for amplitude corrections , 0  pn order corresponds to quadrupole radiation , which is the dominant mode for gr , @xmath37  pn order is a typical signature of dipole radiation , and higher pn order terms correspond to higher harmonics .",
    "we take the following parameters as independent parameters for gr : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the total mass and @xmath41 is the mass ratio . and we assume a signal from a face - on binary system at the zenith , for simplicity . ] on the other hand , we take @xmath42 and @xmath43 as independent parameters for cases a and b , respectively ..    systematic biases caused by approximating waveforms can affect detectable regions of the ppe deviations from gr . to study",
    "how significant these physical effects in ccb systems are , we use a modified gravity signal with , e.g. , nonvanishing spins and recover this with the gr nonspinning templates .",
    "we sum the several contributions to the phase as @xmath44 for gr . on the other hand , we take @xmath45 for ppe phase . here , @xmath46 is the non - precessing spin effect up to the 3pn order relative to the newtonian 0pn term in the phase  @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 is the orbital eccentricity corrections to the 2pn order relative to the leading term  @xcite , with the orbital eccentricity @xmath48 at a reference frequency @xmath49 .",
    "the leading order of the tidal correction is relative 5pn order to the newtonian 0pn term in the phase  @xcite , but the prefactors , the tidal deformability parameter @xmath50 is not small ; @xmath51 for bns with @xmath52  @xcite . depends on the ns masses and equation of state .",
    "] the effects of tidal deformation have been derived up to the relative 2.5pn order to the leading term ( or 7.5pn in the phase ) @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "( here we assume that @xmath50 is same value for both binary components . ) in this work we study the effect of each physical correction in phases ( [ phase_sys_gr ] ) and ( [ phase_sys_ppe ] ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the gw data analysis and an approximate decision scheme to assess the detectability of the mg effects on waveforms .",
    "first , we define the noise - weighted inner product @xmath54 for signals @xmath55 and @xmath56 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the one - sided noise power spectrum density of a detector",
    ". in this paper , we use the noise power spectrum density of the advanced ligo that is called zero det , high power  @xcite .",
    "the interval of integration @xmath59 and @xmath60 is taken to be @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the lower cutoff frequency that is defined for each detector and we take it to be @xmath64 , while @xmath65 is the frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit of the binary .    the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for a given signal @xmath66 is its norm defined as @xmath67 we also define the fitting factor ( ff ) @xcite that is used to characterize the deviations of mg waveforms from the gr waveforms .",
    "the ff between the gr and mg waveforms is defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the gr and mg waveforms . by definition ,",
    "the maximum of ff is 1 , which is realized when the mg waveform coincides with the gr waveform .",
    "thus , @xmath71 measures the strength of the mg corrections that can not be absorbed in the gr waveform even if the source parameters of the gr waveform are changed .",
    "next , let us briefly review bayesian hypothesis testing .",
    "bayes theorem states that the the posterior probability distribution of the hypothesis @xmath72 given the data @xmath73 , @xmath74 , is given as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the likelihood function for the observation @xmath73 , assuming the hypothesis @xmath72 and given values of the parameters @xmath77 .",

    "then , the likelihood function is simply the gaussian distribution @xmath85    bayesian model selection is performed by comparing the posterior probabilities for different hypotheses .",
    "the bayesian odds ratio for mg over gr is defined as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the posterior probabilities of the mg and the gr hypotheses for given data @xmath73 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the prior probabilities of the mg and the gr hypotheses , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the evidence of the mg and gr hypotheses . here",
    ", the ratio between different evidences @xmath93 is the bayes factor between two competing hypotheses , mg and gr , which can assess how much more likely the data @xmath73 is under mg rather than under gr .",
    "following  @xcite , we explain vallisneri s method based on bayesian hypothesis testing . in bayesian statistics ,",
    "one declares the detection of mg corrections to gr when the odds ratio exceeds a chosen threshold @xmath94 .",
    "we define @xmath95 as the odds ratio when the data contain an mg signal , with @xmath96 as the one when the data contain a gr signal .",
    "the distribution of @xmath96 determines the background of false mg detections for a chosen threshold @xmath94 .",
    "we set the threshold @xmath94 by requiring a sufficiently small false alarm probability , @xmath97 , which is the fraction of observations in which the odds ratio @xmath96 happens to exceed @xmath94 for the gr signal . on the other hand , the true detection probability ( also known as the efficiency of the detection )",
