    "the metal - rich stars of the galactic thick disk may be an the evolutionary interface to the thin disk .",
    "the metal - rich extreme of the thick disk will help us to understand whether this transition is smooth and whether there was a hiatus in the star formation history between the two disks . having a well - established upper metallicity limit for the thick disk is also crucial for studies of possible age - metallicity relations in the thick disk .",
    "however , despite the efforts of several recent high - resolution spectroscopic surveys of the galactic thick disk , it is unclear what its high - metallicity limit is .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggests that the thick disk stops at @xmath3\\,\\approx\\,-0.3 $ ] ; @xcite find that the thick disk may not include stars with @xmath3 > -0.3 $ ] ; and @xcite suggest , from their data , that the star formation in the thick disk stopped when the enrichment was @xmath3 = -0.3 $ ] .",
    "it should be noted that all of these studies actually contain stars that are more metal - rich and that have kinematic properties that could classify them as thick disk stars .",
    "however , @xcite regards these stars as  transition objects \" and it is unclear whether they should be treated as thin or thick disk stars , or neither .",
    "@xcite find that metal - rich , potential thick disk stars mainly follow thin disk trends @xcite , and @xcite claim that their metal - rich stars with hot kinematics can not be assigned to the thick disk due to both their highly eccentric orbits , and their low galactic vertical distribution ( low @xmath4 ) . because of this",
    ", they say that the origin of these stars should be sought elsewhere , such as e.g. in the hercules stream ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , even if potential hercules stream stars are excluded @xcite find , in their compilation of high - resolution data from the literature , a considerable number of stars with thick - disk  like kinematics at high metallicities .",
    "but they also conclude that their sample has too few metal - rich stars with thick disk kinematics to really verify their thick disk origin .",
    "in our own studies of the thin and thick disks @xcite we do not insist on an upper metallicity limit for the thick disk , but assume that the stars we see with thick - disk  like kinematics could be members , regardless of their metallicities .",
    "and what we do find is that the kinematically hot stars that we associate with thick disk , and that have @xmath3>-0.3 $ ] , differ significantly from the thin disk stars at the same metallicity .",
    "this applies both in terms of abundance ratios ( e.g. [ mg / fe ] ) , as well as ages @xcite .",
    "also , in @xcite we present a detailed abundance study of 60 f and g dwarf stars that kinematically are likely to be members of the hercules stream .",
    "what we find is that these stars do not form a genuine population but that instead , they are likely to be a mixture of stars from the thin and thick disk populations , verifying that their kinematic properties are probably due to dynamical interactions with the galactic bar .    as the current data on the metal - rich thick disk evidently is very sparse and since there might be indications that the stars of the hercules stream could be a  metal - rich thick disk \" it is important to observe and establish the extreme metal - rich limit of the thick disk .",
    "we have therefore carried out an extensive spectroscopic survey of metal - rich stars that kinematically can be associated with the galactic thick disk .",
    "special care has been applied to exclude stars that have space velocities typical of the hercules stream .    here , we will focus on two elements that show distinct abundance trends for the thin and thick disks : mg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ba ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other @xmath5-elements , iron peak elements , and @xmath6- and @xmath7-process elements will be presented in an upcoming paper ( bensby et al .",
    ", in prep . ) ,",
    "wherein we also will describe the observations , data reductions , abundance analysis , and so forth .",
    "what characterizes the thick disk is that its stars are kinematically hot and rotationally lag behind the local standard of rest ( lsr ) by some @xmath8 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : contour]a and b we plot how the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 velocities for the stars in the @xcite catalogue ( @xmath9 f and g dwarf stars with 3-dimensional kinematic information ) are distributed as a function of metallicity . even though there might be a slight decrease in the number of high - velocity stars as one goes to higher metallicities , there is no sharp drop - off .",
    "instead , there seems to be a significant number of stars with both high metallicities and high velocities .",
    "we used the kinematic method from @xcite to define samples of potential thin disk and thick disk stars .",
    "this method assumes that a stellar population has a gaussian velocity distribution and constitutes a certain fraction of the stars in the solar neighbourhood . assuming that the solar neighbourhood is a mixture of only the thin disk ( @xmath10 ) , the thick disk ( @xmath11 ) , the hercules stream ( @xmath12 ) , and the halo ( @xmath13 )",
    ", we then calculate the probabilities for individual stars ( with known space velocities ) to belong to any of the populations . by forming probability ratios we select thick disk stars as those that have probabilities of belonging to the thick disk that are at least twice the probabilities of belonging to any of the other populations , i.e. @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the 91 new potential metal - rich>-0.60 $ ] .",
    "another sample of new thick disk stars extending to lower metallicities will be presented elsewhere . ]",
    "thick disk stars that we observed are shown together with the 36 thick disk and 60 thin disk stars from @xcite in a toomre diagram in figs .",
    "[ fig : contour]d .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath17 ) , high - quality ( @xmath18 ) echelle spectra were obtained for @xmath19 thick disk f and g dwarfs by tb in jan , apr , and aug in 2006 with the mike spectrograph @xcite on the magellan clay 6.5 m telescope at the las campanas observatory in chile . here",
    "we present the results for the metal - rich part of this sample , 91 stars .",
    "solar spectra were obtained during the runs by observing the asteroid vesta ( in jan ) , the jovian moon ganymede ( in apr ) , and the asteroid ceres ( in aug ) .    for the abundance analysis",
    ", we used the uppsala marcs stellar model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the chemical compositions of the models were scaled with metallicity relative to the standard solar abundances as given in @xcite , but with @xmath5-element enhancements for stars with @xmath3<0 $ ] . to determine the effective temperature and the microturbulence we required all fei lines to yield the same abundance , independent of lower excitation potential , and line strength , respectively . for the surface gravities",
    ", we utilized the accurate _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite for our stars .",
    "final abundances were normalized on a line - by - line basis with our solar values as reference , and then averaged for each element .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : haltplottar0 ] we show the resulting @xmath20-[fe / h]$ ] and @xmath21-[fe / h]$ ] abundance trends for all 127 stars with thick disk kinematics and for the 60 stars with thin disk kinematics .",
    "it is clear that these two groups of stars separate into distinct loci , and that those stars that can be associated with the thick disk show a flat [ mg / fe ] plateau for metallicities below @xmath3 \\lesssim -0.4 $ ] , indicative of fast enrichment from massive stars . towards higher metallicities , the [ mg / fe ] ratio for these stars declines , an indication of the delayed enrichment from low- and intermediate mass stars . approaching solar metallicity",
    ", it also becomes harder to distinguish these stars from the kinematically cold stars of the thin disk as their [ mg / fe ] trends merge .",
    "the [ ba / fe ] ratio , on the other hand , evolves essentially in lockstep with [ fe / h ] for the kinematically hot stars and is even more distinct from the thin disk [ ba / fe ] trend , especially when the two disks approach solar metallicities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : haltplottar0 ] , it is evident that a number of stars with thick disk kinematics have thin disk abundance ratios . in order to investigate the nature of these stars ,",
    "we have divided the thick disk sample into three , equally sized subsamples with different @xmath1 velocities ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : contour]d ) : one that has low galactic rotation velocities ( @xmath22 , figs .",
    "[ fig : haltplottar4]a and d ) , one that has intermediate rotation velocities ( @xmath23 , figs .",
    "[ fig : haltplottar4]b and e ) , and one that has more thin - disk - like rotation velocities ( but high @xmath0 and/or @xmath2 ) ( @xmath24 , figs .",
    "[ fig : haltplottar4]c and f ) .",
    "since the sub - sample with @xmath25 deviates the most from the typical thin disk kinematics , it should be the sample that is the least contaminated by the thin disk , and hence the most representative for the thick disk . in figs .",
    "[ fig : haltplottar4]a and d , we see that essentially all these stars are clearly distinguished from the thin disk sample and have thick disk abundance ratios .",
    "it is also clear that they indeed extend all the way up to solar metallicity .",
    "the subsample with intermediate @xmath1 velocities ( @xmath26 ) is similar to the one with @xmath25 velocities , with the exception that a few stars start to fall within the thin disk abundance trends .",
    "the mixing of the populations is further increased in the @xmath24 subsample , but still with most thick disk stars clearly differentiated from the thin disk trend . in all @xmath1",
    "bins it is clearly demonstrated that the stars with thick disk kinematics and thick disk abundance ratios extend to at least @xmath3\\approx0 $ ] .",
    "the gradual inclusion of stars with thin disk abundance ratios as we approach higher @xmath1 velocities is probably caused by the inclusion of more and more stars from the high - velocity tail of the thin disk .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of similar cuts in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 velocities for the thick disk sample , and the results remain .",
    "we have used high - resolution spectroscopy to trace the galactic thick disk to its highest metallicities .",
    "we find that the kinematically hot stars associated with the galactic thick disk extend to at least solar metallicity , if not above .",
    "we further note that our kinematic selection criteria are not definitive , but tend to include a few stars from the high - velocity tail of the thin disk , in the thick disk sample , especially at thin - disk  like @xmath1 velocities . in an upcoming paper",
    ", we will investigate in detail improvements to the kinematic selection criteria , to determine the feasibility of weeding out the high - velocity tail of the thin disk from kinematically selected thick disk samples .",
