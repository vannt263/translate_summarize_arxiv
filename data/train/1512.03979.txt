    "because the h@xmath0 formation time is long ( some @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the density in @xmath3 ) , and can exceed the crossing time of molecular clouds ( @xmath4 ) , it is important to consider the impact of dynamical effects on the evolution of the h@xmath0 fraction . to understand the h@xmath0 molecule formation process under the dynamical influence of a highly inhomogeneous structure , such as that of molecular clouds , where warm and cold phases are interwoven , we performed high - resolution mhd simulations of realistic molecular clouds formed through colliding streams of warm atomic gas .",
    "for this study we used the ramses code ( teyssier @xcite ) , where we included the formation and destruction processes for h@xmath0 , as well as the thermal feedback ( see valdivia  @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of dust shielding for the uv radiation , and the self - shielding due to h@xmath0 molecules were included by using our tree - based method , detailed in valdivia & hennebelle ( @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath0 is mainly formed in dense regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] _ left _ ) , and it is formed faster than the usual estimates based on the mean density of the cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] _ center _ ) , about @xmath5 instead of @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "we interpret this as the result of the combined effect of the local density enhancement , that drives a faster h@xmath0 formation ( see also glover & maclow @xcite ) , and the shielding provided by the global structure , that ensures the survival of molecular gas .",
    "additionally , the mixing between different phases induce the presence of h@xmath0 molecules in the warm phase , explaining the observed warm h@xmath0 in the diffuse ism .",
    "we have calculated the h@xmath0 populations in the first levels at thermal equilibrium , as well as the doppler broadening parameter @xmath8 for each population ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] _ right _ ) .",
    "excitation diagrams and @xmath8 parameters are in good agreement with the values observed by copernicus and _ fuse _ ( lacour @xcite , gry  @xcite , rachford  @xcite , wakker @xcite ) .",
    "altogether , these results suggest that excited populations might be the consequence of local temperature and density within molecular clouds , highlighting the multi - phase nature of molecular clouds .          2007 ,",
