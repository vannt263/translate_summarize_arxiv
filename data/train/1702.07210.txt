    "besides outflows , jet precession , disk precession , disk warping , spiral arms , flares , and other instabilities , one of the most interesting possibilities involves the existence of a binary system in the core ( and the tidal disruption event ( * ? ? ?",

    "if black hole ( bh ) mass grows via major mergers we might expect to see the signature of a binary black hole in some or many active galaxies , if the merger process involves slow coalescence of the two components .",
    "the variability in the nuclei of galaxies was recognized even before agn were defined as a class .",

    "* ( from 1906 , see e.g. , oknyanskij 2007 ) ) ) , 3c273 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smith & hoffleit 1963 ) ) , with long variability timescale of more than one decade . in the 1950s",
    "it was reported that the ngc 5548 nucleus appeared to vary by about a magnitude ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see more in gaskell & klimek 2003 ) ) .",
    "it is well known that many agn show variability in different time scales and all wavelengths ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( gaskell & klimek 2003 ) ) .",
    "the variability timescales are affected by speed at which physical processes propagate ; most relevant are the speed of light c @xmath0 3 @xmath1 10@xmath2 , the orbital speed @xmath3 and the sound speed @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "the shortest timescale corresponds to the light crossing timescale .",
    "reverberation campaigns are based on measuring light travel time between a spectral feature representative of the ionizing continuum and an emission line . if the time delays are measured as a function of radial velocity , it is possible at least in principle to map the line emitting region .",
    "orbital timescales are longer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( netzer 2013 ) ) .",
    "measuring them could be very useful for determining the dynamical mass of the central bh , while sound speed timescale can give us information about the property of the disk or the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "a question arises : can we identify periodic variations ?",
    "such periodic variability should correspond to orbital motion exclusively , while the other two processes could produce only quasi periodic signals . having an estimate of the bh masses",
    ", we can easily filter expected domains of periodicity that could correspond to the orbital motion , for the optical spectral range , where we have the longest observing records .",
    "unfortunately , the brightest active galactic nuclei were identified only about 70 years ago . therefore observing records",
    "are relatively short , and do not allow to trace many orbits in historical light curves .",
    "extensive spectroscopic observations started even later , because the brightest agn were still faint for the instrumentation available till the mid 1970s .",
    "with such limitation in the data , it is really hard to prove that the signal is periodic . if we were able to reveal periodic signals on the orbital timescales , combining results from the light crossing timescales , and measuring the broad emission line shapes ( since we know that the low - ionization part of the emitting region is virialized ) we could really be able to map the blr .",
    "agn variability patterns present in their light curves mainly correspond to red noise , giving spuriously high significance levels to low frequency periods ( see westman et al .",

    "2016 and bon et al .",

    "agn have been since long known to be dominated by red noise - like light curves .",
    "therefore , standard methods , such as the lomb - scargle ( ls ) method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( lomb 1976 , scargle 1982 ) ) may show very high peaks but the probability of a false positive computed with conventional statistical approximations may not be valid .",
    "such problems in using ls periodogram tests for the analysis of agn x - ray light curves has been known for some time , and they appear especially serious for very frequent quasi - periodic variability detections over long time - scales which turned out to be false ( e.g. , see discussion in vangham 2006 ) .",
    "agn light curves can be modeled as damped random walks ( drw ) or with autoregressive models .",
    "there are some attempts to systematically search for periods in quasars lcs taking this problem into account ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. see charsi et al 2016 , liu et al .",
    "these studies show that periodicities of some candidates show very significant power - spectrum peaks compared to expectation for red noise . in some cases",
    "there is evidence of even more then one period with very high significance compared to autoregressive ( ar ) expectations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see e.g. bahta et al .",
    "2016 ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , even though activity within one period might look stochastic compared to the drw tests , repeating patterns could appear on very long light curves , showing the same complex patterns starting to repeat themselves after some periodic interval ( see folded light curve presented in fig.[fig1 ] , where one can see that noisy pattern repeated after 5676 days in the ngc 5548 optical light curve ; more details are available in ( * ? ? ?",
