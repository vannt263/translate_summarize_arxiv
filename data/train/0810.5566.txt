    "in @xcite khovanov introduced a homology theory for links in @xmath0 that was a categorification of the jones polynomial .",

    "their homology theory incorporated some of the topology of the i - bundle into their invariant .    in @xcite the homology theory from @xcite for i - bundles over orientable surfaces",
    "was constructed using embedded surfaces instead of decorated diagrams .",
    "the theories constructed in this article modify this construction .",
    "section two of the paper introduces preliminary definitions and observations that pertain to all of the homology theories . in section three the infinite family of homology theories",
    "are introduced , one for each choice of @xmath1 .",
    "section four introduces the simple homology theory whose graded euler characteristic is exactly the kauffman bracket of the link in the surface and section five proves invariance of all of the homology theories .",
    "in this section we will define the elements of the chain groups for the two homology theories .",
    "each theory builds on these definitions slightly differently .",
    "let @xmath2 be a surface properly embedded in a 3-manifold @xmath3 . a boundary circle of @xmath2 is said to be * inessential *",
    "if it bounds a disk in @xmath3 , otherwise it is said to be * essential*.    [ comp ]    if @xmath2 is an oriented surface and @xmath4 is an oriented boundary component of @xmath2 then the orientation of @xmath2 is * compatible * with the orientation of @xmath4 if the boundary orientation of @xmath4 from @xmath2 agrees with the orientation of @xmath4 .",
    "two oriented boundary curves of an orientable connected surface are * compatible * if both curves are compatible with the same orientation on the surface .",
    "a * surface link diagram * is an orientable surface together with a link diagram in the surface .",
    "the orientable surface will be referred to as the * underlying surface*.    a * state * of a surface link diagram @xmath5 is a choice of smoothing at each crossing .",
    "therefore a state is represented by a collection of disjoint simple closed curves in the underlying surface of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a surface link diagram with underlying surface @xmath6 .",
    "a * pre - foam * with respect to @xmath5 has the following properties :    * a pre - foam is a compact surface properly embedded in @xmath7 . *",
    "a pre - foam has a state of @xmath5 as its boundary in the top ( @xmath8\\{0 } ) and essential oriented circles as its boundary in the bottom ( @xmath6 x \\{1 } ) .",
    "there are no other boundary components .",
    "* pre - foams may be marked with dots .",
    "two pre - foams are equivalent if they are isotopic relative to the boundary .",
    "the dots on pre - foams are allowed to move freely within components but dots may not switch components .",
    "let @xmath9 be the free @xmath10-module generated by pre - foams with respect to the surface link diagram @xmath5 .",

    "a surface with a non - disk , non - sphere incompressible component , that has a dot on that component equals zero.(ndd )    elements of @xmath12 are called * foams * with respect to the diagram @xmath5 .",
    "we will now make some observations about foams that will be useful later .",
    "[ nontrivdot ] a foam with a dotted component that has an essential boundary component is trivial in the quotient .",
    "if the dotted component is incompressible we are done by the ndd relation .",
    "if not , then apply the nc relation to this component . if the compressing disk was non - separating , then the result of compressing is a component with two dots , thus it is trivial in the quotient by the td relation .",
    "if the compressing disk is separating the result of the nc relation is two components .",
    "one of them has an essential boundary curve since the nc relation does not affect boundary components .",
    "therefore one of the components is not a disk , but they both have dots .",
    "we are now left with two components , each with dots , and one of them has an essential boundary component .",
    "note the component that has an essential boundary curve and a dot satisfies the assumptions of the lemma .",
    "thus we may continue in this manner .",
    "note that each time the nc relation is applied the euler characteristic goes up by two .",
    "since we are dealing with compact surfaces the euler characteristic is bounded above , thus the nc relation can only be applied a finite number of times .",
    "when the nc relation can no longer be applied there is an incompressible component with a dot that is not a disk or a sphere .",
    "( -180,80)@xmath13 ( -115,80)@xmath13 ( -70,80)@xmath14(-15,80)@xmath15(-240,10)incompressible , non - disk and non - sphere @xmath16    it can be seen in the figure that the original surface is equal to a foam that has an incompressible non - disk and non - sphere component with a dot , which is trivial in the quotient by the ndd relation .",
    "[ closedcomp ]    foams with closed dotted non - sphere components are trivial .    if the closed component is incompressible and it has a dot then is trivial in the quotient , by the ndd relation .",
    "if the closed component is compressible , then the nc relation can be applied .",
    "if the compressing disk is non - separating then after the nc relation is applied the new closed component has two dots and is thus trivial in the quotient",
    ".    if the compressing disk is separating then we are left with a sum of closed non - sphere surfaces , one of which has a dot in each summand .",
    "note that each summand satisfies the assumptions of this lemma .",
    "since we are dealing with compact foams and the euler characteristic is bounded above the process will eventually terminate , as in lemma [ nontrivdot ] .",
    "[ esscompr ] if a foam has a non - torus , non - sphere component that is compressible with no inessential boundary curves then it is trivial in the quotient .",
    "since the component is compressible the nc relation can be applied .",
    "after the nc relation is applied the only surfaces present are closed surfaces of non - zero genus , or surfaces with essential boundary curves .",
    "one of these has a dot in each summand and thus the surface is trivial in the quotient by lemma [ nontrivdot ] .",
    "the first homology theory presented is actually an infinite family of homology theories .",
    "there is one theory for each choice of @xmath18 .",
    "we must define conditions on orientations of the boundary components of foams and additional relations for these theories .",
    "1 .   inessential boundary curves of state surfaces are not oriented , but essential boundary curves may or may not be oriented .",
    "however , essential curves in the bottom must be oriented .",
    "2 .   if one component of a state surface has an oriented essential boundary curve , then all essential boundary curves on that component must be oriented compatibly with respect to definition [ comp ] .",
    "the collection of @xmath17-foams are tri - graded .",
    "the first two gradings are @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the third index corresponds to the oriented essential disjoint simple closed curves in the bottom of @xmath7 .",
    "note that given two parallel oriented simple closed curves on a surface it is not difficult to determine if their orientations agree or disagree . to define the third index",
    "it is necessary to specify that one of the orientations possible is the positive one and the opposite orientation is the negative one .",
    "thus for each homotopy class of simple closed curve we assume we have chosen a positive orientation and a negative orientation .                                    since the diagram commutes and both maps are isomorphisms the chain complexes are isomorphic .",
    "these chain complexes produce the same homology as @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively since they are quotients of @xmath50 and @xmath51 by acyclic complexes .",
    "thus @xmath50 and @xmath51 produce the same homology and the theory is invariant under the third reidemeister move ."
