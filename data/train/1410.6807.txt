    "touchstone stars are those for which fundamental parameters - such as effective temperature , mass , or radius - have been directly and precisely measured .",
    "touchstone stars may , for example , be eclipsing binaries , stars with asteroseismic measurements , or objects that have been targeted with interferometry .",
    "these stars can be used to test models of stellar evolution and atmospheres , and the properties of other stars can be determined by empirical comparison with these touchstone stars .",
    "such stars have become increasingly useful and popular for studying the properties of cool stars , particularly late - type and young stars for which methods to measure stellar parameters are not well - established .",
    "direct measurements of fundamental parameters are not within reach for the vast majority of stars , and characterizing stars becomes even more challenging for stars without parallaxes . for surveys like _ kepler",
    "_ , we know the distance to only a small percentage of the targets , but precise stellar parameters are required for accurate planet parameters .",
    "models can provide some constraints , but are less well tested for evolved , very hot , very cold , and young stars because we can not use the sun as a reference . for these stars ,",
    "the models have systematic errors that need to be determined for models to be useful for stellar characterization .",
    "different kinds of touchstone stars provide different insight into stellar properties . by using stellar oscillations as seismic waves ,",
    "asteroseismology probes stellar densities ( subject to the accuracy of the effective temperature ) . pairs or clusters of stars from a common birth cloud or molecular core provide sets of stars with similar ( or identical ) ages and metallicities .",
    "interferometry can be used to measure the angular diameter of a star , which , combined with a measurement of the star s bolometric flux and distance , yields the stellar radius and effective temperature .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations of eclipsing binaries offer precise stellar radii and masses .",
    "the growing use of cool touchstone stars has motivated this in - depth look at how their properties were determined , and how they can be used to study stellar properties more generally . here",
    "we summarize some of the major contributions on cool touchstone stars presented in the cool stars 18 splinter session .",
    "each section represents a contribution from one of the participants , covering the identification of new touchstones , establishing their properties , some of their uses , and conclude with a comparison of results from late - type touchstone stars to predictions from models .",
    "wide binaries provide key astrophysical laboratories for studying the coolest stars .",
    "while wide multiple systems as a population can act as a metric for the star formation process , it is their utility as benchmark systems that has been most valuable in recent years .",
    "very cool / ultracool companions to well characterized main sequence stars can have their age and metallicity inferred from the primary .",
    "these are then be used along with the luminosity of the companion to calculate an effective temperature using evolutionary models .",
    "this can be compared to an effective temperature derived from atmospheric model fits to the companion s observed spectrum .",

    "in addition the companion to hip 6407 was resolved into a tight 0.13 arcsecond l1+t3 binary .",
    "while hierarchical triples such as this one are ideal benchmark objects , the orbital period of the two components of the secondary is over 300 years making direct mass determination impractical .",
    "the combination of interferometry data with trigonometric parallax values and spectral energy distribution fitting based on literature photometry allows for direct determination of stellar radius , effective temperature , and luminosity .",

    "the eclipse light curves are modeled using the jktebop code @xcite which , in its latest implementation , allows for the simultaneous modeling of radial velocity measurements , accounts for the smoothing of the light curve due to finite integration times , and includes the capability to model the modulation of the light curve due to spots from the primary , secondary or third light components @xcite .",
    "the high precision of the _ kepler _ data allows the scaled radii of the m dwarf ebs ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) to be determined to better than 1% accuracy , and in many cases to better than 0.1% .",
    "an example of one fit to a single primary / secondary eclipse pair for one of the brighter ebs in this sample is shown in figure  [ fig ] .",
    "results show that for cases in which the rotation periods of the stars are not commensurate with the binary period that the effects of spot modulation on fitted parameters average out over the time baseline of the _ kepler _ dataset .",
    "this allows for a much simpler approach to fitting where the lightcurves can be `` detrended '' and normalized before fitting the entire dataset .",
    "an approved observational program is currently underway to measure the radial velocities for the entire sample using the w. m. keck observatory with sufficient accuracy and phase coverage to determine the masses of both components to better than 3% accuracy .",
    "also ongoing are multi - band near - infrared and optical eclipse measurements with the perkins @xmath5 telescope at lowell observatory and the minerva test facility on the caltech campus , respectively . from these observations ,",
    "measurements of the effective temperatures of both stellar components can be made .",
    "a parallax program using the discovery channel telescope at lowell observatory will determine the absolute distances to the closest ebs in the sample , while the distances to the rest of the sample will have to wait for gaia parallaxes .",
    "detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) are extremely valuable objects because their masses and radii can be determined in a model independent manner to a precision of a few percent or less @xcite .",
    "this makes them excellent , independent tests of models of stellar evolution . while there are many well - characterized systems on the main sequence ( and hence many observational constraints ) , there are only 9 such systems on the pre - main sequence ( pms ) below 1.5@xmath6 .",
    "constraints on the pms are important because evolution is very rapid and the models are still sensitive to their initial conditions .",

    "seven other detached , double - lined ebs were identified , which are most likely field systems , and 19 single - lined ebs , four of which could be cluster members .",

    "stellar models including simplified magneto - convection prescriptions can reconcile models with observations of touchstone stars in ebs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , recently , in the population of single stars @xcite .",
    "quantitative predictions of the required surface magnetic field strengths are often consistent with expectations based on empirical data @xcite , implying that magnetic models may be capturing relevant physical processes despite simplified prescriptions .",
    "there remains discussion , however , about the validity of magnetic models in the fully convective regime .",
    "interior magnetic field strengths in excess of 1  megagauss are typically required @xcite , which may be difficult to produce in a fully convective dynamo and which threaten to quickly become unstable if they do develop .",
    "star spots can be invoked to relieve the burden placed on models of magneto - convection , particularly in the fully convective regime @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that spots can bias radius measurements toward larger radii by as much as 6% , if spots are located preferentially near the poles and cover a significant fraction ( upward of 60% ) of the stellar surface .",
    "slight radius inflation from suppression of flux leaving the stellar surface is also expected , with the two effects conspiring to explain observations of radius anomalies for fully convective ebs .",
    "presently , there is no strong empirical evidence of polar spots on rapidly rotating low mass stars or stars below the fully convective boundary , but relatively few stars have been studied in this capacity @xcite . further observational evidence for or against the magnetic hypothesis is still needed .",
    "in the meantime , studies are underway to explore other potential explanations .",
    "if we instead look only at fully convective stars in ebs , a pattern emerges with lower metallicity stars displaying larger deviations from theoretical predictions ( see figure  [ fig : feh_rad ] ) . with only six fully convective stars in ebs that possess reliable metallicity estimates , it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion that metallicity and radius deviations are anti - correlated , but it is tantalizing nonetheless . isolating the fully convective stars in the interferometric sample makes this hypothesis less compelling , but the lack of mass estimates adds uncertainty to unambiguously identifying stars below the fully convective boundary",
    "however , @xcite have indicated that a trend with metallicity might exist in the full interferometric sample ( see their figure  2 ) .",
    "however , the sample shows considerable scatter and is sparsely populated at the low metallicity end .",
    "no compelling physical explanation has been offered for an anti - correlation between radius deviations and metallicity .",
    "already , touchstone stars have identified the possible need for new model physics in the form of magnetic fields and/or activity , as well as the possible need for improvements in current micro - physics .",
    "we can only expect a more robust identification of model shortcomings as the sample of touchstone stars increases , leading to more directed refinements of current micro - physics and additions of new physics . with advancements in determining metallicities of low mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fully convective stars may provide one of the more interesting subsets of touchstone stars .",
    "they are relatively insensitive to current model parameters and may therefore more easily reveal areas deserving of concerted attention .",
    "one example is using remaining discrepancies between models and fully convective touchstone stars to investigate helium abundance as a function of metallicity in the local galactic neighborhood ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
