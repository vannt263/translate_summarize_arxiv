    "starting in 1987 with the analysis of g29 - 38 by @xcite , about twenty metal - enriched white dwarfs with a significant infrared excess in their spectra have been discovered , without a cool companion being found . due to their high surface gravity",
    "the sedimentation time of these objects is rather short . to explain the high metallicity by ongoing accretion , a metal - rich dust cloud was suggested as a donator source .",
    "spitzer observations confirmed the dust material @xcite , which is located in an equatorial plane @xcite forming a metal - rich but hydrogen- and helium - poor @xcite dust disk .",
    "for the hottest of those white dwarfs , with @xmath1 , @xcite proclaimed that their dust material is sublimated to a gaseous disk . and",
    "indeed , five white dwarfs , found in the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. fig.[fig:1 ] ) by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* priv .  comm . )",
    "indicate gas disk emission features in their spectra in addition to the ir spectral component of a dust disk .",
    "these gas features are mainly the caii @xmath08498,8542,8662 , although at least two of the five spectra also show a feii @xmath05018,5169 in emission .",
    "former planetary systems around the white dwarfs progenitor may survive the host stars late evolutionary phases , as different theoretical approaches have shown ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "after the actual formation of the white dwarf , a smaller rocky body , an asteroid or planetesimal , might have been disturbed in its orbital motion by another surviving , larger planet .",
    "when it reaches the inner part of the system close to the central object , it will get tidally disrupted , providing the material to form the dust and gaseous disk .",
    "the disk s spectral line features are expected to be double peaked as the emitting material rotates with its kepler velocity around the white dwarf . surprisingly , these double - peak structures show a significant difference in the red / violet peaks line strengths , shown in fig.[fig:2 ] for the prominent caii feature of sdssj122859.93 + 104032.9 ( hereafter sdssj1228 + 1040 ) .",
    "we assumed this asymmetry to directly originate from an actual asymmetric disk geometry .",
    "hydrodynamically simulating the shape of a disk changing with time , we later modified our spectrum - simulation code according to these geometrical situations .",
    "8498,8542,8662 in the spectrum of sdssj1228 + 1040 .",
    "each line is split due to the kepler rotation of the disk but shows an asymmetry in the relative strengths of the red / violet peaks , favoring the red wing peak in this case.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      for the hydrodynamic investigation of a viscous gas - disk we used the code fargo ( _ _ f__ast _ _ a__dvection in _ _ r__otating _ _ g__aseous _ _ o__bjects ) by .",
    "even though being almost exclusively used in the calculation of protoplanetary disks and planet formation scenarios , this code is suited for all kinds of sheared fluid disks .",
    "we calculated the temporal evolution of a blob of material , starting with a gaussian density distribution ( parameters given in tab.[tab:1 ] ) .",
    "as a first result of our analysis , we had to increase the inner radius of the disk to at least @xmath2 in order to suppress broad line wings and to fit the flat continuum between the triplet components as well as the line s steep profiles .",
    "the latest result by @xcite being @xmath3 is only slightly smaller than our value . as matching the asymmetric line profile was the main goal of this work , we were able to achieve this well for both geometries , although the relative strengths of the red / violet parts of each line seem to be generally estimated too low in the case of the closed disk structure .",
    "of course the effect of the geometrical asymmetry strongly depends on the orientation towards the observer . with the rotation of the asymmetrical disk around the central object , the line profile should vary .",
    "* priv .  comm . ) did , in fact , report on a change in the line profile in the order of years for at least two of the known five objects .",
    "but the predicted variability timescale of our model seems to be much shorter ( order of hours ) than the observations do suggest .",
    "we thank boris gnsicke for sending us his sdssj1228 + 1040 spectrum in electronic form and for useful discussions .",
    "also we like to thank tobias mller from the computational physics group in the institute for astronomy and astrophysics of the university of tbingen for providing us with the fargo code and the hydrodynamic simulations .",
