    "the procedure determines that the limit @xmath1 ( @xmath0 is the curvilinear coordinate variable perpendicular to the curved surface ) must be performed after calculating all derivatives with respect to @xmath0 , and the limit @xmath2 ( @xmath3 denotes the thickness of the curved surface ) must be done after integrating all integrations of @xmath0 . employing the framework , we reconsider a spin - less charged particle confined on a curved surface in an electromagnetic field . for the considered system , the coulomb gauge , which is chosen for the vector potential of the electromagnetic field , the motion of the vector potential , which couples to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) electric currents @xmath4 , and the schrdinger equation are together originally defined in ( 3d ) curved space .",
