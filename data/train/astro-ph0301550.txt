    "globular clusters ( gc ) have traditionally been considered as good tracers of the process that led to the formation of their host galaxy , whether this was a `` monolithic '' relatively rapid collapse of the primeval gas cloud , as described by @xcite , or a `` hierarchical '' capture of smaller fragments on a longer time baseline , as described by @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a recent review on this issue .    therefore , knowing the distance to gcs with high accuracy is important in several respects :    * cluster distances , along with information on the dynamical , kinematic and chemical properties of the clusters , are essential to provide a complete description of the galaxy formation , early evolution and chemical enrichment history . *",
    "accurate distances are needed in order to derive the age of gcs from the stellar evolution theory , i.e. by comparing the absolute magnitude of the main - sequence turn - off ( ms - to ) region in the color - magnitude diagram with the corresponding luminosity of theoretical isochrones .",
    "the precise knowledge of absolute ages has important cosmological implications ( e.g. the age of the universe ) , whereas relative ages provide detailed information on the formation process of the host galaxy . *",
    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of a gc system is one of the most powerful candles for extragalactic distance determinations , as it peaks at a rather bright luminosity ( @xmath3 ) , and gcs are numerous in both spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "an accurate calibration is essential both for testing the assumption of universality of the lf and for deriving its absolute value , hence again the importance of disposing of accurate distances to local gc calibrators .",
    "distances to gcs can be obtained by several methods that use either the cluster as a whole ( direct astrometry ) or some `` candle '' stellar population belonging to the cluster , e.g. horizontal branch ( hb ) and rr lyrae stars , main sequence stars , white dwarfs , eclipsing binaries , the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the clump along the rgb . in the latter case",
    "the distance stems from the determination of the absolute magnitude of the selected `` candle '' , which in turn may depend on a purely theoretical or a ( semi)-empirical calibration .    here",
    "we review the distance determinations to gcs using only rr lyrae ( and hb ) stars .",
    "distance determinations to gcs using also the other possible methods have been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "rr lyrae stars have been traditionally the most widely used objects for the purpose of distance determination ( see @xcite for a general review ) , because they are i ) easy to identify thanks to their light variation ; ii ) luminous giant stars ( although less bright than the cepheids ) hence detectable to relatively large distances ; iii ) typical of old stellar systems that do not contain population i distance indicators ( such as the classical cepheids ) , and iv ) much more numerous than the population ii cepheids .",
    "but of course the property that qualifies them as _ standard candles _ is their mean brightness , which has been known to be `` nearly constant '' in any given globular cluster ( within a narrow range of variation ) since bailey s work in early 1900 .",
    "however , accurate studies have shown a few decades later that the mean intrinsic brightness of the rr lyrae stars is not strictly constant : first , it is a ( approximately linear ) function of metallicity , i.e. @xmath4 +   \\beta$ ] ( @xcite ; @xcite ) with a variation of @xmath50.25 mag over 1 dex variation in metallicity ; second , even within the same cluster , i.e. at fixed metallicity , there is an intrinsic spread in the hb luminosity due to evolutionary effects , whose extent can vary from @xmath50.1 to @xmath50.5 mag as a function of metallicity ( @xcite ) ; finally , it has recently been shown that the luminosity - metallicity relation is not strictly linear , because it depends also on the hb morphology and stellar population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "notwithstanding these aspects that introduce a significant intrinsic variation in the absolute magnitude of the rr lyrae variables , these stars remain excellent distance indicators once these effects are properly known and taken into account .    as a first approximation , and for the purpose of taking into account small corrections due to metallicity differences , when needed in comparing different results , we assume that the @xmath6-[fe / h ] relation is linear , with the parameters estimated by @xcite as the average of several methods , i.e. @xmath7 +   ( 0.93\\pm0.12)\\ ] ] @xcite found the same slope and 0.92 for the zero - point",
    ".    we shall now consider the main methods of absolute magnitude determination for rr lyrae stars , with special attention to those that have experienced a substantial improvement recently .",
    "the aim is to estimate the most accurate and reliable value for the @xmath8 parameter in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which can then be used to derive the distance to globular clusters and other old stellar systems of known metallicity . for this purpose also studies dealing with field rr lyrae stars will be reviewed , on the verified assumption that globular cluster and field rr",
    "lyrae stars share the same characteristics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this method works by balancing two measurements of the velocity ellipsoid of a given stellar sample , obtained from the stellar radial velocities and from the proper motions plus distances , via a simultaneous solution for a distance scale parameter .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the stellar sample can be adequately described by a model of stellar motions in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite provided the most recent review of this method , and summarized the results previously obtained by various groups on field rr lyraes using slightly different algorithms and assumptions but basically the same sample of stars and very similar input data . from the work of @xcite on 147 rr lyrae stars , which contains a very careful analysis and corrections for all relevant biases ,",
    "the average magnitude is @xmath9 at [ fe / h]=1.6 .",
    "a very interesting result is the analytic expression for the relative error in the distance scale parameter reported by @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "they show that for a group of stars with a given velocity dispersion and bulk motion , and with observational errors smaller than the velocity dispersion , the relative error in the distance scale parameter is proportional to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of stars in the sample . for a halo stellar population such as the rr lyraes",
    ", where observational errors in the radial and tangential velocities are typically 20 - 30 km / s and velocity dispersions are @xmath5 100 km / s , a more effective way of improving the results is by increasing the number of stars in the sample rather than improving further the quality of the velocity determinations . @xcite tried this way by defining the radial velocity ellipsoid using 716 metal - poor non - variable and 149 rr lyrae stars , and matching it with the distance - dependent ellipsoid derived from the proper motions of the rr lyraes alone .",
    "the result is @xmath12 at [ fe / h]=1.71 .",
    "the accuracy of this hybrid solution , however , is hardly any better given the bigger chance of thick disk contaminants even at low metallicity .",
    "we remind that @xcite find that the local fraction of metal - poor stars that might be associated with the metal weak thick disk ( mwtd ) is on the order of 30%-40% at abundances below [ fe / h]=1.0 , and a significant fraction of these may extend to metallicities below [ fe / h]=1.6 .",
    "@xcite applied this method to a sample of 262 local rr lyrae variables .",
    "they separated `` halo '' from `` thick disk '' objects by metallicity ( @xmath0<-1.0 $ ] ) and kinematic criteria , and assumed an initial distance scale @xmath13 $ ] ( i.e. @xmath14 = 0.79 at [ fe / h]=1.5 ) to transform proper motions into space velocity components .",
    "they then determined @xmath15 for the `` halo '' population at [ fe / h]=1.6 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the previous ones from this method .",
    "however , the possibility of kinematic inhomogeneities within the `` halo '' sample is strongly reassessed by @xcite , who identify two different populations among the metal - poor subset in this sample of stars",
    ". these two spherical subsystems would have different dynamical characteristics and origins , the slowly rotating subsystem being associated to the galactic thick disk , and the fast rotating ( possibly with retrograde motion ) subsystem belonging to the accreted outer halo .",
    "it is not quite clear if and to what extent the kinematic selection criteria adopted to separate `` halo '' and `` thick disk '' populations introduce a bias in the subsequent kinematic analysis of this method , and the effects on the final result of the adopted distance scale and possible contamination from the mwtd stellar component .",
    "it is not impossible that the application of the statistical parallax method to the local rr lyrae stars might need a more detailed and accurate modelling of the stellar motions in the galaxy , as well as a much larger sample of stars to work on , in order to provide reliable and robust results .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes are the most straightforward method of distance determination , being based on geometrical quantities independent of reddening . only with",
    "@xmath17 trigonometric parallaxes for a good number of hb and rr lyrae stars have become available .",
    "however , they are not accurate enough for a reliable individual distance determination , except for the nearest star , rr lyr , for which a relatively high precision estimate of @xmath18 ( 4.38@xmath190.59 mas ) was derived by @xmath17 ( @xcite ) . a previous ground - based estimate ( i.e. 3.0@xmath191.9 mas ) was reported in the yale parallax catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new and very important result in this field is the determination of a more accurate parallax for rr lyr using hst - fgs3 data ( @xmath20 mas ) by @xcite .",
    "this leads to a true distance modulus @xmath21 mag , or @xmath22 mag if one adopts instead the weighted average of all three parallax determinations @xmath23 mas .",
    "rr lyr has @xmath24 mag and [ fe / h]=1.39 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . depending on whether one assumes @xmath25 mag as the average absorption value from the reference stars surrounding rr lyr , or @xmath26 mag as the linearly interpolated local value from the same reference stars , one obtains @xmath27 mag or @xmath28 mag , respectively .",
    "following @xcite we adopt @xmath27 mag , which leads to @xmath6 = 0.58@xmath190.13 at [ fe / h]=1.5 .",
    "this final error takes into account also the cosmic scatter in luminosity due to the finite width of the instability strip , by adding in quadrature an adopted value for the cosmic dispersion of 0.07 mag .",
    "this effect , which is negligible when many stars are involved , should be taken into account when dealing with individual stars .      since , as we discuss in sect .",
    "2.5 , rr lyraes are hb stars , @xcite adopted the approach of considering all field metal - poor hb stars with @xmath17 values of @xmath18 in a magnitude limited sample , @xmath29 .",
    "this selection criterium led to a sample of 22 stars , of which 10 were hb stars on the blue side of the instability strip , 3 were rr lyrae stars , and 9 were red hb stars .",
    "using the globular cluster m5 as a template to reproduce the shape of the hb , @xcite estimated the correction in @xmath14 to apply to each star in order to report it to the middle of the instability strip , and derived @xmath30 mag at [ fe / h]=1.41 , or @xmath31 mag at [ fe / h]=1.51 excluding one red hb star suspected of belonging to the red giant population .",
    "a reanalysis of this sample was performed by @xcite , who eliminated all red hb stars from the sample as a prudent way to ensure that no contamination from the red giant branch ( rgb ) was present , applied a different weighting procedure by the observational errors , and considered the effect of intrinsic scatter in @xmath14 in the estimate of the malmquist bias .",
    "their result was @xmath32 at [ fe / h]=1.62 ( but @xcite point out that this result may be questionable since the metallicity scale for blue hb stars is not well determined ) . finally , @xcite using all stars of this sample and taking into account the intrinsic scatter in the hb magnitudes when correcting for the lutz - kelker effect , derived @xmath33 mag at [ fe / h]=1.5 .",
    "this method derives the distance of a pulsating star by comparing the linear radius variation , that can be estimated from the radial velocity curve , with the angular radius variation , that can be estimated from the light curve .",
    "it is common belief that the b - w results are `` faint '' , based on the large amount of work done on field rr lyrae stars during the past decade by several independent groups , and revised and summarized by @xcite : @xmath35 + ( 0.98\\pm0.05)\\ ] ] hence @xmath6 = 0.68 at [ fe / h]=1.5 .      *",
    "use of various sets of model atmospheres , with and without overshooting treatment of convection , [ @xmath36/fe]=+0.4 ; some experimental models with no convection , that mimic the effects of a different treatment of convection e.g. the @xcite approximation , were also tried .",
    "* use of the detailed variation of gravity with phase , rather than the mean value ; the values of log@xmath37 at each phase step were calculated from the radius percentage variation ( assuming @xmath38 ) plus the acceleration component derived from the radial velocity curve .",
    "* use of new semi - empirical calibrations for bolometric corrections , based on the temperature scale for population ii giants defined from rgb and hb stars in several globular clusters using infrared colors ( @xcite ) .",
    "* use of various assumptions on the @xmath39-velocity , and turbulent velocity = 2km / s and 4km / s over all or part of the pulsation cycle . * use of bvrik photometric data . *",
    "the matching of the linear and angular radius variations was performed on the phase interval @xmath40 to avoid shock - perturbed phases .",
    "it was found that i ) the use of k magnitudes and v ",
    "k colors provided the most reliable and stable results , and ii ) all other options produced similar results within 0.03 mag , except the test case that used an unrealistically large amplitude of the @xmath39-velocity curve .        from the evolutionary point of view , rr lyrae stars are low - mass stars in the stage of core helium burning located in a well defined part of the hb , i.e. the temperature range approximately 5900 - 7400 k , known as the `` instability strip '' .",
    "therefore theoretical models of hb stars within this temperature interval should in first approximation be able to describe the average properties of rr lyrae variables , were they not be pulsating .",
    "theoretical models ( hence the hb morphology and luminosity level ) depend significantly on assumed input parameters .",
    "the strongest dependence besides [ fe / h ] is on the helium abundance , but other parameters may have an effect , such as [ cno / fe ] , peculiar surface abundances due to mixing during the rgb phase , diffusion or sedimentation , rotation , magnetic field strength , some other yet unknown factor that affects mass loss efficiency , or a combination of any of these , as well as theoretical assumptions such as the equation of state , the treatment of plasma neutrino energy loss , the correct treatment of conductive opacities in rgb stars , the 3-alpha reaction rate , etc . briefly on anything that can affect the ratio total mass vs core mass of the star .    for these reasons several research groups have been actively working on the construction of new hb models trying to include as much improved input physics as possible . without entering into the details of the individual choices and assumptions , for which we refer the reader to the original papers , we report the results found by six independent groups , namely @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( based on the work by @xcite ) , @xcite ( from outer halo globular clusters only ) , and @xcite .    we show in fig . 1 how @xmath41 varies with [ fe / h ] , where @xmath41 is the mean absolute v magnitude of an hb star at log@xmath42=3.85 , that is taken to represent the equilibrium characteristics of an rr lyrae star near the middle of the instability strip .",
    "the original theoretical data usually refer to the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) rather than the average hb ( or rr lyrae ) magnitude level .",
    "the two quantities @xmath43 and @xmath41 are not identical . the stars in this evolutionary phase evolve rapidly away from the zahb : less than @xmath5 10% of their total hb lifetime is spent on the zahb itself , and the remaining time is spent at 0.1 - 0.2 mag brighter luminosities ( @xcite ) .",
    "this aspect of stellar evolution has been discussed in several papers ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    therefore the real zahb is intrinsically poorly populated , and when a comparison is made with the lower envelope of the observed hbs , which would represent the zahb , this is of difficult definition because of the uncertainties due to small sample statistics and photometric errors . so the comparison between hb theoretical models and observed hbs ( including rr lyrae stars ) is made at the ( brighter ) magnitude level where the stars spend most of their hb lifetime .",
    "this is usually taken into account by correcting the theoretical @xmath44 $ ] relation by a fixed offset ( of the order of 0.08 - 0.10 mag ) , or by applying an empirical correction that is itself a function of [ fe / h ] , such as the one derived by @xcite : @xmath45 + 0.16\\ ] ]        \\i ) all models agree that the slope of the @xmath46 $ ] relation is not unique , i.e. this relation is _ not universal _ and is _ not strictly linear _ , as originally suggested by @xcite . as a first approximation ,",
    "however , all models can be roughly described by a linear relation with average slope @xmath5 0.23 , excluding the oldest set of models ( @xcite ) that are flatter .",
    "\\ii ) as far as the zero - point is concerned , there are two families of results differing by @xmath5 0.13 mag , i.e. @xcite and @xcite with @xmath47 = 0.43 @xmath19 0.12 at [ fe / h]=1.5 , and @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite with @xmath47 = 0.56 @xmath19 0.12 . again , @xcite models differ as they fall exactly in between these two estimates .",
    "new pulsation models have been calculated recently by @xcite , based on non - linear convective hydrodynamical models with updated opacities and the classical mlt treatment of convection ( @xcite ) . in combination with hb evolutionary models",
    "it is then possible to derive the period - luminosity - metallicity relation for first overtone pulsators ( rrc stars ) at the blue edge of the instability strip , which in turn allows to estimate the luminosity @xmath48 of the rr lyrae stars at the reference temperature log@xmath42=3.85 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath6 vs. [ fe / h ] has been found to vary with the hb morphology and metallicity range , and could possibly be approximated by a quadratic relation .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity this relation can be described by two linear relations that , for [ @xmath36/fe]=+0.3 , are : @xmath49+(0.80\\pm0.10 ) ~at ~[fe / h]~ < ~-1.5\\ ] ] and @xmath50+(1.01\\pm0.12 ) ~at ~[fe / h ] ~ > ~-1.5.\\ ] ] at the junction point [ fe / h]=1.5 there is a discontinuity of 0.06 mag , the average value being @xmath6 = 0.58@xmath190.12 .",
    "the relations expressed in eq .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , and comparison data points for a number of galactic globular clusters , are shown in fig .",
    "2 . compared with the theoretical hb models shown in fig.1 , these pulsation models are consistent with the family of results that produce the fainter magnitudes .",
    "infrared ( k - band ) observations of rr lyrae stars had shown already several years ago that there exist a relatively tight relation between period @xmath51 and mean k absolute magnitude @xmath52 , with no ( or little ) dependence on metallicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these empirical relations , however , had to be calibrated on some independent method of absolute magnitude determination , which was usually the baade - wesselink method in its various versions , hence different zero - points .",
    "also the dependence on metallicity , admittedly small , was not assessed unambiguously .",
    "the values of @xmath53 so derived could vary on a range of @xmath5 0.15 mag .",
    "based on the same set of updated non - linear convective pulsation models described above , @xcite have defined a theoretical period - luminosity - metallicity relation in the infrared k band @xmath54 , which is much less sensitive to reddening and metallicity than the visual equivalent relation , and therefore is supposedly more accurate ( total intrinsic dispersion @xmath55=0.037 mag ) : @xmath56 - 0.766\\ ] ] note that this relation has been derived for models with solar scaled metallicities ; models with [ @xmath36/fe]=+0.3 , that are well mimicked by models with @xmath57=[fe / h]+0.21 $ ] according to the recipe by @xcite , would produce fainter @xmath53 by @xmath5 0.035 mag .    in principle , the non - linearity of the @xmath58 $ ] relation and the change of slope at [ fe / h]@xmath51.5 could be taken into account by defining two separate linear relations for models with [ fe / h]@xmath591.5 and [ fe / h]@xmath601.5 , respectively . in practice ,",
    "the effect of non - linearity and the change of slope are negligibly small and the linear relation defined over the entire metallicity range that is relevant for rr lyrae stars and globular clusters provides the same @xmath53 values within the errors .",
    "very recently @xcite have revised the above analysis and derived improved period-(v  k)color - luminosity - metallicity ( @xmath61 ) relations for fundamental and first - overtone pulsators separately ( see bono , this conference , for more details ) .",
    "these new relations , also based on solar - scaled metallicity models , seem to give systematically brighter magnitudes by a few hundredths of a magnitude with respect to the @xmath62 relation expressed in eq .",
    "we now apply the @xmath62 relation in eq .",
    "( 6 ) to a few test cases for which accurate data are available , i.e. the rr lyrae stars in the globular clusters m3 and @xmath63 cen , the 7 field rr lyrae stars with @xmath0=-1.5\\pm0.15 $ ] for which the baade - wesselink method was applied , and the field variable rr lyr itself .    * * m3 . *",
