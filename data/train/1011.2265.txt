    "one of the earliest papers to appear on the subject is @xcite wherein glassey and schaeffer show that global classical solutions to @xmath12 will exist for initial data that are spherically symmetric , compactly supported in momentum space , vanish on characteristics with vanishing angular momentum , and have @xmath13-norm below a critical constant @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 more recently , hadi and rein ( @xcite ) showed the non - linear stability of a wide class of steady - state solutions of @xmath17 against certain allowable perturbations utilizing energy - casimir functionals . shortly thereafter ,",
    "lemou , mhats , and raphal ( @xcite ) investigated non - linear stability and the formation of singularities in @xmath17 through concentration compactness techniques .    in this work , we focus exclusively on the attractive case and henceforth suppress the superscript on both @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xcite , kiessling and tahvildar - zadeh prove that a unique global classical solution to the relativistic vlasov - poisson system exists whenever the positive , integrable initial datum @xmath19 is spherically symmetric , compactly supported in momentum space , vanishes on characteristics with vanishing angular momentum , and has @xmath1-norm below a critical constant @xmath2 , with @xmath20 if and only if @xmath0 . the constant @xmath2 is critical in the sense that , everything else being equal , initial data can be found which lead to blow - up in finite time if their @xmath1-norm is allowed to be ever so slightly bigger than @xmath2 .",
    "this critical constant is given by the following minimization problem : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the set of probability measures on @xmath23 with finite first moment which are absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure having density in @xmath1 .",

    "its value is @xmath29 , which is equal to the one given by either bound .    in this paper , we address the determination of the critical norm for all remaining cases .",
    "we begin in the next section by proving the existence of minimizers for @xmath30 in a slightly larger class of functions @xmath31 to be defined below .",
    "after that , we characterize the minimizers via variational techniques and find that they are the well known lane - emden polytropes .",
    "this will show that the minimizers are actually in our original space @xmath22 .",
    "finally , we compute the optimal constant in terms of the parameter @xmath7 and the first zero and corresponding slope of the standard polytropes . at the end , we mention some numerical results pertaining to the calculation of @xmath32",
    "to begin with , as remarked in the  note added \" in @xcite , the variational problem ( 1),(2 ) is equivalent after rescaling to the one given by lemou , mhats , and raphal in @xcite , who designed it for different purposes , namely to study blow up dynamics for the relativistic vlasov - poisson system . instead of giving a detailed analysis",
    ", they refer the reader to their earlier work @xcite where they study an analogous variational principle ( given in formula 1.18 ) for the non - relativistic vlasov - poisson system .",
    "thus , in principle we could build on their results to evaluate @xmath33 . instead , here we first give a somewhat different proof of the existence and characterization of minimizers by combining the techniques of weinstein ( @xcite ) ( also referred to by lemou , mhats , and raphal ) with those of lieb and simon ( @xcite ) .",
    "this strategy has certain advantages , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "we find it convenient ( for reasons explained below ) to expand the class of functions over which we attempt to minimize @xmath30 . to that end , define @xmath34 and note that @xmath35 ( indeed , a function @xmath36 will also be in @xmath22 whenever @xmath37 is finite and the @xmath38-norm is equal to 1 ) .",
    "since we have allowed functions of arbitrary @xmath38-norm into our considerations , we need to adjust our definition of @xmath30 . assuming @xmath39 and inserting @xmath40 into @xmath30",
    ", we arrive at the appropriate functional : @xmath41 we now seek to minimize @xmath42 over this enlarged space of functions . in the next section , we will show that there exist minimizers for @xmath42 over @xmath31 that are also in @xmath22 .",
    "the demonstration that minimizers exist closely follows weinstein ( @xcite ) . since @xmath43 for all functions in @xmath31",
    ", we can find a minimizing sequence @xmath44 so that @xmath45 since we are minimizing over a larger class of functions , @xmath46 and so the upper bound noted above still holds . applying the well - known procedure of spherically symmetric equi - measurable rearrangements ( c.f .",
    "* chapter 3 ) ) , we can assume @xmath47 ( committing a slight abuse of notation ) where @xmath48 is the angle between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    for any positive real numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the triple family of scaling @xmath53 leaves @xmath42 invariant while @xmath54 taking advantage of this scaling invariance , we can assume that our minimizing sequence has the following properties : @xmath55 hence , the banach - alaoglu theorem and the reflexivity of @xmath1 for @xmath56 give us a function @xmath57 such that some subsequence of @xmath58 converges weakly in @xmath1 to @xmath59 . without loss of generality , we assume that we have already extracted this subsequence .",
    "standard arguments concerning lower semi - continuity and weak convergence ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) show that @xmath60 so that @xmath61 ( this is the advantage of expanding the space of functions as showing that @xmath62 is difficult at this point ) . thus , we can conclude the following is true : @xmath63    since by construction @xmath64 we will be done if we can show that @xmath65 converges to @xmath66 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath25 is upper semi - continuous with respect to weak convergence , and so all we can immediately conclude is that @xmath67    to show the convergence of @xmath65 to @xmath66 , we first rewrite the potential energy functional as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 we seek bounds on @xmath71 which will then imply bounds on @xmath72 .",
    "to that end , lemma 4.3 in @xcite implies that@xmath73 with exponents given by @xmath74 note that @xmath75 is an increasing function of @xmath7 and that the limiting case of @xmath28 gives @xmath76 .",
    "thus @xmath77 and @xmath71 are in @xmath78 for all @xmath7 and all @xmath79 . also note that the sequence @xmath80 is uniformly bounded in @xmath81-norm , and so some subsequence must converge weakly in this space .",
    "standard arguments show that this weak limit must equal @xmath77 a.e .",
    "next , we can conclude that @xmath72 and @xmath82 are in @xmath83 for @xmath84 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 10.2 ) ) . note that @xmath85 is also an increasing function of @xmath7 and the limiting case of @xmath28 makes this exponent equal to 6 .",
    "we can turn the local estimates into global ones for all @xmath86 via the following growth estimate on the potential .    for any spherically symmetric @xmath87",
    ", the marginal mass distribution @xmath88 will also be spherically symmetric .",
    "hence , the well known formula for the potential of a spherically symmetric mass distribution gives @xmath89 where in the last step we have used that for our purposes @xmath90 so , if @xmath91 for @xmath86 , then we have for any @xmath92 @xmath93 thus , we may conclude that for the distributions we are considering , @xmath72 and @xmath82 are in @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "note that this proves that @xmath96 is indeed in @xmath97 for spherically symmetric @xmath36 .",
    "as with @xmath71 , we have a bound on the @xmath98-norm of @xmath72 that is independent of @xmath79 , and so some subsequence of @xmath99 must converge weakly in this space . as usual , this weak limit must equal @xmath82 a.e .",
    "we can actually say something much stronger about the convergence of @xmath100 to @xmath82 - namely that any subsequence converging weakly to @xmath82 will actually converge strongly in @xmath101 on sets of finite measure for any @xmath102 . to see this",
    ", we note that since @xmath103 is in @xmath104 , we know that @xmath105 is locally in @xmath106 where @xmath107 thus , @xmath105 is locally in @xmath108 whenever @xmath109 arguments like the one leading to ( [ kb_bnd ] ) for @xmath72 show that these functions decay rapidly enough at infinity to be in @xmath108 proper , and that the decay is independent of @xmath79 .",
    "again , some subsequence of @xmath110 will converge weakly in @xmath108 and must converge to @xmath111 . following the proof of (",
    "* theorem 8.6 ) , we have the strong convergence stated above .",
    "combining our upper bound for @xmath112 and the local strong convergence gives us that @xmath100 converges strongly to @xmath82 in @xmath98 for @xmath113 : @xmath114    finally , we are in a position to show the convergence of @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that @xmath115 and hence @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 the first term in the last inequality can be made arbitrarily small since @xmath72 converges strongly to @xmath82 in @xmath119 for @xmath115 and the @xmath120-norm of @xmath71 is bounded above independently of @xmath79 by standard interpolation estimates .",
    "the second term can be made arbitrarily small by the weak convergence of @xmath71 to @xmath77 in @xmath120 ( after possibly another subsequence extraction ) and the fact that @xmath82 is in the dual space - @xmath119 .",
    "we see that inequality ( [ minineq ] ) is saturated , and we have that @xmath121 note that this forces @xmath122 thus , we have shown the existence of minimizers for @xmath42 over the space @xmath31 satisfying the properties given above .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that @xmath59 can be chosen so that it is compactly supported for @xmath115 , so that among all possible minimizers for @xmath42 there is indeed one in @xmath22 - proving that @xmath123 .",
    "we want to find the infimum of @xmath42 over the space of functions @xmath31 introduced in the last section .",
    "following an idea in lieb - simon ( @xcite ) we first note that @xmath31 is a convex space of functions so that , if @xmath59 is a minimizer of our functional over @xmath31 and @xmath124 is any function in this space , then for all @xmath125 we have that @xmath126 . consequently , we can consider @xmath127 where by @xmath128 we have in mind the one - sided gateaux derivative from the right at zero .",
    "this technique avoids the difficulty that arbitrary variations of a given @xmath129 may become negative ( and hence no longer belong to @xmath31 ) .",
    "direct calculation gives us that this derivative is @xmath130 we now compute the indicated derivatives separately .",
    "we begin with the ultra - relativistic kinetic energy : @xmath131 next , we easily compute : @xmath132 finally , we find : @xmath133 where we have used @xmath134 as in the previous section .",
    "inserting these into our derivative above , collecting terms and noting that all the constant terms cancel ( i.e. those terms not involving an integration against @xmath124 ) yields @xmath135 \\eta(p , q)\\;d^3p\\;d^3q.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the indicator function of any set of finite measure is in @xmath31 , we are tempted to simply conclude that @xmath136 or equivalently that @xmath137 such a function can not be in @xmath31 since whenever @xmath138 we get complex values for @xmath59 in general .",
    "hence , we take @xmath139 where @xmath140 means the positive part of the argument .    since we have altered the natural minimizer so that it lies in @xmath31 , we need to examine the effect on the one - sided gateaux derivatives of our functional .",
    "let @xmath141 be the support of our minimizer @xmath59 .",
    "every @xmath142 can be decomposed as @xmath143 .",
    "hence , @xmath144 \\eta(p , q)\\;d^3p\\;d^3q.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but on the the set @xmath145 , we have that @xmath146 and that the integrand is strictly positive . hence , for any @xmath142 @xmath147 showing that @xmath59 as defined in ( [ minid ] ) is indeed a minimizer for @xmath42 over @xmath148    we now use scaling invariance to pick out a special minimizer that we will use to calculate @xmath149 . to that end , recall that the triple family of scalings as given in ( [ scaling ] ) @xmath150 ( where @xmath151 and @xmath52 are positive real numbers ) leaves @xmath42 invariant . as noted in the previous section , using this scaling we can choose @xmath59 so that its @xmath38-norm is @xmath152 .",
    "we break from the remaining choices above by requiring @xmath153 ( as opposed to @xmath154 ) .",
    "hence , we can no longer choose the @xmath1-norm to be @xmath152 .",
    "such choices are completely arbitrary since we have an infinite number of minimizers from which to pick .",
    "however , these choices give a minimizer of particularly nice form .",
    "our choices so far force @xmath155 and @xmath156 which leaves us some room to choose either @xmath157 or @xmath158 in a convenient way . using ( [ minid ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath159 where we have used @xmath160 .",
    "if we choose for @xmath157 and @xmath158 : @xmath161 @xmath162 then we get the following : @xmath163 where @xmath164 and where the constant @xmath165 can be determined from the constraint @xmath166 from this point forward , we drop the subscripts @xmath167 and @xmath52 as we now focus our attention on this particular minimizer .    next , we determine @xmath168 in more detail .",
    "we begin by computing the marginal mass distribution over configuration space : @xmath169 where the last line follows by successive integration by parts . by definition , @xmath170 so upon taking the negative laplacian of both sides we have @xmath171 with @xmath172 our previous arguments with spherically symmetric equi - measurable rearrangements show that we can assume @xmath168 is spherically symmetric ( where we take the center of the distribution to be the origin of our coordinate system ) .",
    "we write @xmath173 let @xmath174 be the first zero of @xmath175 . then on the ball @xmath176 the partial differential equation above becomes @xmath177 note that the first boundary condition is forced by the differential equation if we are to have a finite solution at the origin",
    ". the second boundary condition will ensure that @xmath59 integrates to one ( which also specifies the constant @xmath165 which we have conveniently absorbed into the definition of @xmath168 ) .    noting that the equation ( [ minpde ] ) essentially gives the gravitational potential of our mass distribution ( up to a sign difference ) , outside the ball @xmath176 we must have @xmath178 we note that as a potential function , @xmath168 is zero at the boundary of the mass distribution and not at infinity ( as is usually the case ) .",
    "this fact is easy to forget and can be the source of many headaches !",
    "since for each @xmath115 the associated density @xmath59 has compact support ( c.f .",
    "section 5 ) , we can conclude that @xmath62 as promised in the previous section .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath2 ( the infimum over @xmath62 ) is equal to the infimum over the larger space @xmath31 , and both are given by @xmath179 .",
    "note that this is also true for the critical case @xmath180 as shown in @xcite .",
    "we begin by recalling the calculation above ( c.f .",
    "( [ rhoeq ] ) ) for the the spatial mass density associated to @xmath59 ( that is , the marginal distribution over @xmath50-space ) : @xmath181      we begin with a simple integration by parts on the defining pde for @xmath168 : @xmath182 since @xmath183 when @xmath184 .",
    "we pair this with the pohozaev identity : @xmath185 this identity can be seen by first noting @xmath186 the left - hand integral is fairly easy : @xmath187 the right - hand is more involved , and after a lengthy calculation yields : @xmath188 finally , combining these two expressions for the dirichlet integral gives @xmath189 or equivalently @xmath190 as we show below , this identity makes computation of the functionals comprising @xmath30 remarkably easy !",
    "@xmath191      @xmath192      our choice of scaling is meant to ensure that the potential energy of our minimizers equals their ultra - relativistic kinetic energy . to check this",
    ", we calculate the potential energy directly .",
