    "neptunium - based oxides have been extensively investigated by experiments @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite due to the technological importance that neptunium is one of the important long - lived actinides which accumulate in high level waste during the conventional nuclear fuel cycle . among neptunium oxides ,",

    "as for the electronic structures of actinide dioxides ( ao@xmath0 ) , taking ( a = u , np or pu)o@xmath0 for example , the 5__f _ _ orbitals are partially occupied , accompanying the competition between the quantum process of localization and delocalization of a 5__f _ _ electrons , which leads to many complex behaviors .",
    "this also makes the accurate description of electronic structure of ano@xmath0 series to be difficult achieved .    conventional density functional theory ( dft )",
    "that apply the local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) underestimates the strong on - site coulomb repulsion of the 5__f _ _ electrons and , consequently , describes actinide dioxides as incorrect ferromagnetic ( fm ) metals instead of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) mott insulators .",
    "one more promising way to improve the drawback is lda+__u _ _ or gga+__u _ _ approach , in which the underestimation of the strong intraatomic coulomb interaction is corrected by the hubbard _ u _ parameter .",
    "recently , the electronic structures , mechanical properties , and high - pressure behaviors of uo@xmath0 and puo@xmath0 have been correctly reproduced using lda+__u _ _ or gga+__u _ _ calculations @xcite .",
    "the insulator character of npo@xmath0 is established by the experiments@xcite . however , to our knowledge , a systematical theoretical investigation of electronic structure and mechanical properties for npo@xmath0 is still lacking .",
    "consequently , based on the good performance of lda / gga+__u _ _ approaches in describing the electronic structure of the strong - correlation systems , we carried out the present study of npo@xmath0 .    in the present study ,",

    "_ b _ of afm npo@xmath0 on _ u _ shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice](b ) , it is clear that the lda results ( 220 - 228 gpa ) are always higher than the gga results ( 188 - 200 gpa ) , which is due to the above mentioned overbinding effect of the lda approach . at a typical value _ _",

    "the fermi energy level is set at zero . ]",
    "almost all the macroscopical properties of materials , such as hardness , elasticity , and conductivity , originate from their electronic structure properties as well as chemical bonding nature .",
    "therefore , a correct description of electronic structure is necessary for further investigating these properties . in the following",
    ", we will show the dramatic improvement brought by the lda / gga+__u _ _ schemes compared to the pure ones as describing the electronic structure properties of npo@xmath0 . the total density of states ( dos ) as well as the projected dos for the np 5__f _ _ and o 2__p _ _ orbitals at four selective values of _ u _ within lda / gga+__u _ _ formalisms are shown in fig .

    "( see fig .",
    "4 ) . overall , the lda+__u _ _ and gga+__u _ _ give an equivalent description of the one - electron behaviors in a wide range of _ u_. at a typical value _",
    "_ u__=4 ev , one can see from fig .",
    "[ dos ] that the occupied dos near the fermi level is featured by the three well - resolved peaks .",
    "the narrow one near @xmath131.0 ev is principally np @xmath2 in character , while the other two broad peaks respectively near @xmath132.0 and @xmath134.0 ev are mostly o @xmath21 .",
    "these well - separated orbital peaks have been observed in the recent ultra - violet photoelectron spectroscopy ( ups ) measurement @xcite .",
    "in addition , the width of the np 5__f _ _ valence band is 1 ev , consistent with the hybrid functional calculation @xcite and experimental data @xcite .",
    "the o 2__p _ _ valence band width is of 4.5 ev , also in accord with the experimental data ( 4 ev ) and previous hybrid functional result ( 4.5 ev ) .",
    "the mott gap opened at _ _",

    "the calculated amplitude of local spin moment is @xmath223.1@xmath23 ( per np atom ) in both afm and fm phases and within the two dft+__u _ _ schemes . on the whole",
    ", although the pure lda and gga fail to depict the electronic structure , especially the insulating nature and the occupied - state character of npo@xmath0 , our present results show that by tuning the effective hubbard parameter in a reasonable range , the lda / gga+__u _ _ approaches can prominently improve upon the pure lda / gga calculations and , thus , can provide a satisfactory qualitative electronic structure description comparable with the experiments . by further increasing @xmath24 to 6 ev , one can see that the peak near @xmath131.0 ev becomes weak and is mostly o  2@xmath25 .",
    "meanwhile , there develops a prominent hybridization between np 5__f _ _ and o 2__p _ _ orbitals .",
    "this picture of dos is no longer valid since the peak near the valence band maximum has been experimentally verified @xcite to be due to the np 5__f _ _ contribution .",
    "thus , the overestimation of @xmath24 will compel np 5__f _ _ orbitals to be even more localized , resulting in their unphysical alignment with the o 2__p _ _ orbitals .     insulating band gap for the afm npo@xmath0 . ]     in ( 1@xmath260 ) plane computed in the lda+__u _ _ formalisms with _ _ u__=4 ev .",
    "the contour lines are drawn from 0.0 to 1.5 at 0.1 e / @xmath7 intervals . ]    in order to understand the chemical bonding nature of ground state npo@xmath0 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ charge ] the valence charge density map of the ( 1@xmath260 ) plane .",
    "evidently , the charge density around np and o ions are all near spherical distribution with slightly deformed toward the direction to their nearest neighboring atoms .",
    "moreover , the charge density around np and o ions is high while there are almost no remaining valence charges in the large octahedral - hole interstitial region .",
    "this suggests that remarkable ionization of neptunium and oxygen ions and significant insulating property exist for afm npo@xmath0 .",
    "we have also plotted the line charge density distribution along the nearest np - o bond ( not shown ) and find that the minimum value of charge density is 0.51 e / @xmath7 .",
    "the distance between this minimum point and np ion is 1.29  .",
    "thus , the ionic radius of np in npo@xmath0 can be defined as @xmath27=1.29  . after subtracting this value from the np - o bond length ( 2.34  ) ,",
    "the oxygen ionic radius @xmath28=1.05   can be obtained .",
    "the corresponding valency of np and o in npo@xmath0 can be estimated by calculating the valence charges within the spheres of ionic radii .",
    "after integration , we find 11.386 electrons around np and 6.233 electrons around o. therefore , the valency of np and o can be represented as np@xmath29 and o@xmath30 respectively , which demonstrates prominent ionicity of the np - o bond .",
    "however , the ionicity of np - o bond is relatively weaker when compared with the th - o bond in tho@xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the np - o bond has stronger covalency than the th - o bond due to that the minimum value 0.51 e / @xmath7 of charge density along the np - o bond in npo@xmath0 is prominently larger than that along the th - o bond ( 0.45 e / @xmath7 ) in tho@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this finding is consistent with the fact that the 5__f _ _ orbitals are more localized in the former in line with the localization - delocalization trend demonstrated by the actinides series . through analyzing the orbital - resolved partial densities of states ( pdos ) for the afm npo@xmath0 , we find that the ionicity of the np - o bond can be attributed to the charge transfer from np 6__d _ _ and 5__f _ _ states to o 2__p _ _ states , while the covalency of the np - o bond is associated with the hybridization of o @xmath31 and np @xmath32 states located from @xmath1320.73 to @xmath1313.07 ev .",
    "overall , the np - o bond can be described as a mixture of covalent and ionic components .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our calculated elastic constants , various moduli , pressure derivative of the bulk modulus _",
    "b@xmath33 _ , and poisson s ratio @xmath15 for _ fm@xmath16 m _ npo@xmath0 at 0 gpa are collected in table [ elastic ] . here , the moduli and poisson s ratio are deduced from the calculated elastic constants using the same scheme as that in our previous study on isostructural tho@xmath0 @xcite . each derived bulk modulus _ b _ turns out to be very close to that obtained by fitting murnaghan equation of state .",
    "this indicates that our calculations are consistent and reliable . at a typical value of _ _ u__=4 ev , lda+__u _ _ gives bulk modulus of 230 gpa for both afm and fm npo@xmath0 , while gga+__u _ _ gives 200 gpa .",
    "obviously , gga+__u _ _ approach gives more closer value than lda+__u _ _ with respect to the experimental value .",
    "overall , the bulk modulus of npo@xmath0 is bigger than that of tho@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this originates from relative higher valence electron density and shorter bond distances of npo@xmath0 than those of tho@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the hardness of npo@xmath0 is investigated by using the approach raised by simunek _",
    "_ @xcite . in the case of two atoms 1 and 2 forming one bond of strength _",

    "this indicates that the fluorite npo@xmath0 is a hard material and approaches to a superhard material ( hardness @xmath41 40 gpa ) .",
    "the high hardness of this crystal can be understood from the dense crystal structure , which results in high valence electron density and short bond distances .",
    "we notice that the hardness of npo@xmath0 is higher than that of tho@xmath0 ( 22.4 gpa ) @xcite .",
    "this also can be attributed to the higher electron density and shorter bond distance of npo@xmath0 compared with tho@xmath0 .      before phonon dispersion calculation",

    "one can see that the gap between the optic modes and the acoustic branches is not so evident .",
