    "a key tool in the quest for the determination of the structure of molecules and proteins is nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( nmr ) which has helped to make fundamental contributions to the advancement of biological sciences .",
    "this is achieved by measuring the magnetic response of molecules in a large ensemble to sequences of radio frequency pulses .",
    "this temporal response is then mapped to multi - dimensional spectra which encode the dynamical properties of the system and therefore the interactions between its constituent nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "the information contained in these spectra forms the basis for the determination of molecular structure .",
    "current nmr schemes are intrinsically ensemble measurements , both due to the minute size of the nuclear magnetic moments and the tiny polarization of these nuclear spins at room temperature , even in very strong magnetic fields .",
    "consequently , nmr can only deliver ensemble information while the structure and dynamics of individual specimens remain hidden from observation .",
    "recent progress in the control of the single electron spin in nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond offers a new perspective here , as it can make use of optically detected magnetic resonance @xcite for the detection of material properties @xcite including minute magnetic fields @xcite . building on this , recent theoretical investigations",
    "@xcite have suggested that nv centers implanted a few nanometers below the surface should be able to detect and locate individual nuclear spins above the diamond surface .",
    "subsequent experimental work has indeed achieved the observation of small clusters of nuclear spins outside of diamond with a sensitivity that is sufficient to identify even individual nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges for the determination of the structure of smaller biomolecules or even entire proteins by means of 2d spectroscopy detected by an nv center is the considerable amount of data that need to be taken which results in long measurement times .",
    "indeed , the large amount of required data and the associated long measurement times represent a challenge that is common to both ensemble nmr and single molecule nmr measurements .",
    "as suggested in @xcite we demonstrate nv sensing experiments on nuclear spins using methods from the field of signal processing , particularly matrix completion @xcite . with this technique",
    "we can obtain reliably the spectral information that is contained in 2d - nmr spectra from a small subset of all accessible data points ( see @xcite and @xcite for applications of the related but distinct compressive sensing and non - uniform sampling to bulk nmr ) .",
    "the results presented here show that order of magnitude reduction in the overall measurement time in nv center based 2d - nmr can be achieved .",
    "in the remainder we briefly introduce matrix completion in section [ matrixcompletion ]",
    ". then section [ experimentalimplementation ] presents the application of this method to concrete experimental data that have been obtained from an nv center interacting with a nearby nucleus .",
    "the results demonstrate that already a sampling rate of around @xmath2 suffices to reconstruct the spectral information reliably .",
    "we finish with a brief conclusion and outlook concerning the potential of this approach for diamond quantum sensing .",
    "this section serves to introduce briefly the concept of matrix completion , the basic properties relevant to this work and the specific algorithm that we use for its application to our experimental data .",
    "a 2d - spectrum encodes the response of a system to a sequence of pulses with varying temporal separation , denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and arrange the result in a data matrix @xmath5 .",
    "the 2d - spectrum @xmath6 is then obtained as the fourier transform of both time coordinates in @xmath7 . in our work",
    "we are sampling randomly chosen elements of the matrix @xmath7 with indices @xmath8 drawn from the index set @xmath9 , leading to constraints @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "matrix completion solves the task of obtaining the missing matrix entries of @xmath7 that have not been measured in experiment . in general",
    "this is impossible unless we have further knowledge about the matrix @xmath7 , namely that it typically has a low singular value rank @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "fortunately , this is indeed the case for typical data sets and especially those from 2d spectroscopy .",
    "one possible approach to achieve this matrix completion is by solving the minimization problem @xmath14      \\label{tracenorm}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the trace norm of the matrix @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a given tolerance .",
    "indeed , it can be proven that this formulation of the problem achieves the desired aim @xcite as the solution of eq .",
    "( [ tracenorm ] ) yields the matrix @xmath7 with high probability if the number of sampled elements @xmath18 where @xmath12 is the singular value rank of the @xmath19 matrix @xmath7 ( see @xcite for proofs and a rigorous mathematical statement ) .",
    "this suggests that a computational gain by a factor of order @xmath20 may be achieved through random sampling in the manner described above ( see for example @xcite on computed 2d - spectroscopy data ) .",
    "this still leaves us with the task of solving the minimization problem eq .",
    "( [ tracenorm ] ) . in principle , this equation can be rewritten as a semi - definite programme and then solved employing standard solvers for convex problems .",
    "unfortunately , standard solvers tend to be limited to relatively small matrix sizes , but fortunately alternatives exist .",
    "indeed , @xcite proposed to solve eq .",
    "( [ tracenorm ] ) approximately through the so - called singular value thresholding ( svt ) algorithm @xcite which permits very large matrices to be treated .",
    "it is this algorithm that we will be using in our work .",
    "the svt - algorithm solves iteratively the set of equations @xmath21 where @xmath22 for @xmath11 and zero otherwise and eq .",
    "( [ svt1 ] ) represents the singular value decomposition of the matrix @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are free parameters in the procedure that regulate the soft thresholding ( eq .",
    "4 ) and the inclusion of the constraints ( eq .",
    "5 ) . the choice @xmath26 ensure provable convergence and @xmath27 for @xmath19-matrices represent typical values ( see @xcite ) . as a termination criterion of the iteration we employ the condition @xmath28 for some @xmath17 , and @xmath29 being the frobenius norm @xcite .",
    "the algorithm employs a singular value decomposition which , for large matrices , can be accelerated considerably @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that other approaches for solving eq .",
    "( [ tracenorm ] ) such as those reported in @xcite may lead to improved performance and/or stability but for the purposes of this study svt was sufficient and recommended itself thanks to its ease of implementation . in any real - world application , the measured entries of the data matrix will be corrupted at least by a small amount of noise .",
    "hence the question of the robustness of the matrix completion approach to fluctuations in the experimental data arises naturally .",
    "reassuringly , results have been developed that guarantee that reasonably accurate matrix completion is possible from noisy sampled entries @xcite . in that scenario noise",
    "can be neglected if the relevant spectral information can be still extracted from the low rank approximation of @xmath7 , thus implicating a sufficiently large signal - to - noise ratio and leading to the fact that noise contribution results in small singular values , which are discarded after applying our algorithm .",
    "hence matrix completion offers three major advantages :    * weak noise is directly suppressed by the matrix completion algorithm * the spectrum of the system can be recovered from a small subset of all data e.g. only 10@xmath1% of the total in our examples . * in contrast to compressed sensing , the algorithm used here does not require any additional information , e. g. the sparse basis @xcite .    the following section will now present the result of the application of the matrix completion algorithm to concrete experimental data that have been obtained in our laboratory .",
    "the method of matrix completion has been implemented in 2d optical spectroscopy of rb vapour @xcite .",
    "we use a single nv centre in diamond coupled to a proximal @xmath0c nuclear spin as a test system for the demonstration of the matrix completion protocol .",
    "nvs are optically active point defect centres in the diamond crystal .",
    "their fluorescence depends on the electron spin number @xmath30 of the triplet ground state , allowing to measure the electron spin of single centres .",
    "nvs close to the diamond surface have been used to detect few thousand external protons @xcite followed later by a demonstration of even single spins sensitivity @xcite leading to nano - scale magnetic resonance imaging @xcite . for these type of experiments",
    "the data acquisition is quite long due to the low fluorescence emission from single centres .",
    "+ the nv has a triplet ground state ( electron spin @xmath31 ) coupled to the nitrogen nuclear spin ( @xmath32n , @xmath33 ) .",
    "the system can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath34 where @xmath35ghz is the zero field splitting of the ground state , @xmath36 is the land factor , @xmath37 is the bohr magneton , @xmath38 is the applied static magnetic field , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the electron and nuclear spin operators and @xmath41 is the hyperfine interaction tensor . the @xmath42 axis is taken to be along the nv crystal axis . if there is a single @xmath0c nuclear spin ( @xmath43 ) in the proximity , the following term @xmath44 is added to the spin hamiltonian , with @xmath45 being the hyperfine interaction tensor to a @xmath0c nuclear spin .",
    "one of the simplest 2d nmr experiments consists of three @xmath46 pulses and is called correlation spectroscopy ( cosy ) @xcite . in our work",
    "we use its `` equivalent '' in the electron spin resonance - the three pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation ( eseem ) pulse sequence ( see @xcite for more details ) shown in .",
    "the sequence starts with a laser pulse of about 3 @xmath47s to polarize the nv electron spin in the @xmath48 state .",
    "afterwards we apply four @xmath46 microwave pulses at times @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the last pulse is used to transfer the electron spin coherence into population , which is read out by the last laser pulse .",
    "the spin signal is recorded for each pair of ( @xmath53,@xmath54 ) and then a 2d fourier transform is performed giving a set of frequencies ( @xmath55,@xmath56 ) . from this spectrum",
    "the number of nuclei coupled to the electron spin and the off diagonal elements of the hyperfine interaction tensor ( e.g. proportional to @xmath57 ) can be obtained @xcite .",
    "we applied this pulse sequence in two different experiments . in the first measurement we use a single nv without resolvable coupling to @xmath0c spins .",
    "the system consists of a nv electron and a nitrogen nuclear spins , which are described by the hamiltonian in .",
    "if the static magnetic field is aligned with the nv axis , the hyperfine interaction tensor @xmath41 is diagonal and there is no eseem effect . in order to introduce artificial `` off - diagonal '' terms",
    ", we apply the static @xmath58  g off - axis , at an angle of about @xmath59 degrees with respect to the @xmath42 axis .",
    "the expected 2d spectrum @xmath60 can be simulated by using the hamiltonian   and is plotted in a.    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     too small threshold values @xmath24 ,",
    "e.g. at @xmath61 or @xmath62 ( pink and orange markers ) , lead to low fidelity when less than @xmath63% of the matrix elements are sampled .",
    "we can achieve higher fidelities @xmath64 by increasing @xmath24 and we observe saturation around @xmath65 .",
    "that is , for @xmath66 we can not obtain higher significantly higher fidelities , while the required computation time ( equivalent to the number of iterations ) increases which can be seen in the inset graph in .",
    "from there we can conclude that with our data set thresholds even below the empirically suggested rule @xmath67 for our case of @xmath68 ( see section  [ matrixcompletion ] and @xcite ) are sufficient .",
    "a python script can be found in the supplementary information , where the svt algorithm is implemented , together with the data set from figure  [ eseem]b .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated the application of a method for reconstructing a two dimensional eseem spectrum , by collecting only small part of the data in the time domain . with our technique",
    "we can obtain the necessary spectral information by measuring 10% of the experimental data points in two different experiments . by using our method ,",
    "the measurement time can be shortened by a factor 10 at the same signal - to - noise ratio compared to the conventional experiment .",
    "we believe that the reported results will be useful for any type 2d nmr and esr spectroscopy and also for magnetic resonance imaging .",
    "our method is particularly useful for single spins experiments , which usually require very long measurement times @xcite .",
