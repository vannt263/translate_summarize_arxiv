    "extended over the entire lattice , the two structures correspond to the @xmath2 and @xmath85 states .    according to the rules formulated above",

    "an example of such a tunneling process is given by the operator sequence acting on the ground state from left to right @xmath228 see fig .",

    "the respective energy shift depends explicitly on the mutual orientation of @xmath45 and @xmath46 because @xmath229 .",
    "however , an obvious symmetry leaves the degeneracy intact at this order of expansion , because for any coupling between @xmath45 and @xmath46 there is a `` mirror '' counterpart to the tunneling process that couples @xmath45 with @xmath48 identically , see fig .",

    ", the two processes provide the same energy gain to both @xmath2 and @xmath1 states .    generalizing this trend to the higher - order terms having the form @xmath232",
    ", we conclude that the processes represented by the graphs with trivial topology , i.e. connecting sites 2 and 3 via site 1 only , have to be discarded because there always exists a mirror graphs that connect site 2 and 3 via precisely the same process .    therefore , the tunneling paths which lift the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath1 states must have a non - trivial topology , with the shortest one making a loop around a hexagon , see fig .  [ fig : kagdeg](c ) . because such processes also need to be proportional to @xmath233 , they appear in the seventh order of expansion with one of the hexagon sides containing a double link .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the double link must be located on one of the two bonds : ( 1,2 ) or ( 1,3 ) .",
    "according to the rules formulated above , all relevant seventh - order perturbation terms have to contain two double - flips @xmath221 and two single - flips @xmath215 , the latter acting only on bonds ( 1,2 ) and ( 1,3 ) .",
    "then , the remaining three links must contain either double spin - flip @xmath221 or spin - flip hopping @xmath234the fourth term in ( [ v ] ) , @xmath235 , does not contribute to this order in @xmath12 .",
    "note that there are close parallels between the non - linear swt and the real - space approach .",

    "the number of double - flips @xmath221 or spin - flip hoppings @xmath234 in a specific tunneling process determines the sign of the corresponding energy correction ( [ de ] ) .",
    "in fact , according to ( [ v ] ) , every double - flip operator carries a minus sign , whereas spin - flip hopping has a prefactor @xmath236 , which is positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath5 . for the seventh - order processes , denominator in ( [ de ] ) contains the product of six negative factors and is positive .",
    "one example of the possible 7th order processes , which involves two double spin flips , two single flips , and three spin - flip hops , is given by the operator sequence ( from left to right ) @xmath237 the intermediate stages of this perturbation process are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interm](a ) where positions of spin flips is indicated by circles .",
    "using @xmath205 and calculating the matrix elements we obtain @xmath238 one can also easily determine the respective multiplicative factor @xmath239 associated with permutations of operators in ( [ v7a ] ) , though our subsequent conclusions do not depend on precise numbers .",
    "for @xmath240 , the energy correction ( [ de7a ] ) is negative and favors ferromagnetic alignment of second - neighbor spins , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kagdeg](a ) , i.e. , the @xmath2 structure . for @xmath241 , the energy correction changes sign and favors the @xmath1 state of fig .",
    "[ fig : kagdeg](b ) .    clearly , @xmath194 is special , because the spin - flip hopping amplitude @xmath242 vanishes .",
    "at this value of anisotropy , the non - vanishing 7th order processes must involve only double spin flips and two single spin - flips .",
    "an example of such process is given by @xmath243 with intermediate states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interm](b ) and the energy shift @xmath244 straightforward but tedious calculation of the multiplicative factor attributed to ( [ de7b ] ) yields @xmath245 .",
    "because of the positive sign , the correction @xmath246 corresponds to the antiferromagnetic effective interaction between second - neighbor spins , fig .  [",
    "fig : kagdeg](b ) , for the entire range @xmath247 .",
    "hence , we can claim that for @xmath194 quantum fluctuations stabilize the @xmath1 structure .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath248 , the spin - flip hopping amplitude @xmath242 has the same negative sign as @xmath249 , making the sign of all 7th - order perturbation processes contributing to the quantum energy shift the same , thus favoring the @xmath1 state .",
    "we emphasize again that this conclusion relies only on the sign of the matrix elements and the order of the perturbation process , which , in turn , depends on the length of the shortest topologically nontrivial loop in the lattice .",
    "thus , the quantum selection of the @xmath1 state for @xmath248 stems from the lattice geometry .    for @xmath240 , the perturbation terms with odd number of spin - flip hops change sign and favor the @xmath250 state .",
    "this implies that the transition between the two magnetic structures can only happen at @xmath56 whose value must be determined by summing all contributions including corresponding multiplicative factors .",
    "this is , again , in accord with the answer from the second - order non - linear swt , @xmath57 .",
    "another close parallel between the non - linear swt and the real - space approach is worth noting .",
    "the high order of the tunneling processes relevant to the degeneracy lifting explains the origin of the smallness of the quantum order - by - disorder effect .",
    "since the real - space perturbation theory is , essentially , an expansion in coordination number ( @xmath251 for the kagom lattice ) , a rough but intuitively straightforward estimate of the seventh - order process , taking into account the number of next - nearest neighbor bonds and multiplicative factor of the symmetry - related processes , gives @xmath252 per spin .",
    "this is in a very good agreement with the results of swt , @xmath253 for @xmath194 .",
    "obviously , such a close quantitative agreement with the naive estimate is simply fortuitous .",
    "a more careful calculation for @xmath194 , using our results in ( [ de7b ] ) with the combinatorial factor gives @xmath254 .",
    "this is in a good qualitative agreement with the swt results and also implies that the higher - order `` dressings '' of the loop - like processes are quantitatively important .",
    "a couple of additional remarks concern the `` third - neighbor '' effective interaction of spins 2 and 3 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kagdeg ] .",
    "the corresponding linked cluster has one more link and hence appears only in the eighth order of perturbative expansion .",
    "moreover , because of the even number of sites , all 8th - order processes must involve at least one spin - flip hopping operator @xmath234 .",
    "thus , for @xmath194 the 8th - order energy shift @xmath255 vanishes and one has to go to the 9th order and the larger cluster .",
    "all that indicates that the @xmath85 spin structure should be stable with respect to the higher - order corrections ."

    "<S> previously , a self - consistent spin - wave treatment of the heisenberg limit @xcite has provided an indirect evidence in favor of the @xmath2 ground state for @xmath31 . here </S>",
    "<S> this result is strongly implied by a direct calculation of the ground - state energy . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we observe that the energy gain from the quantum obd effect is only a fraction of @xmath32 per spin .    _ </S>",
    "<S> real - space perturbation theory._what is the mechanism of quantum selection of the ground state ? </S>",
    "<S> we address this question using the rspt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach divides the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) into an unperturbed part @xmath33 , describing spin fluctuations in the local field @xmath34 , and perturbation @xmath35 , which couples fluctuations on adjacent sites . </S>",
    "<S> then , the standard perturbation theory is used to calculate quantum corrections to the classical ground - state energy . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between spin fluctuations contains four terms @xmath36 @xmath37 where we introduce @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and keep @xmath42 in @xmath43 explicit , see @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> the first three terms in ( [ h_rspt ] ) can be referred to as double spin - flip , spin - flip hopping , and single spin - flip , the latter being a descendant of the cubic term ( [ h ] ) . as in the @xmath12 expansion , this is the only term which is sensitive to the 120@xmath13 pattern and , therefore , is the key to the selection of the ground state .    since every term in the energy expansion corresponds to a finite cluster of spins coupled by perturbations in ( [ h_rspt ] ) and </S>",
    "<S> since the classical ground state is a vacuum for spin flips , contributions that are relevant to lifting the ground - state degeneracy must begin and end with a double spin - flip and must also contain a pair of single spin - flips . </S>",
    "<S> the first process of such kind appears in the fourth order , an example given by the operator sequence @xmath44 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rspt](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the respective energy shift depends on the mutual orientation of @xmath45 and @xmath46 because @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> however , an obvious symmetry leaves the degeneracy intact at this order of expansion , because for any coupling between @xmath45 and @xmath46 there is a `` mirror '' process that couples identically @xmath45 with @xmath48 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rspt](b ) , providing the same energy gain to both the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 states .    </S>",
    "<S> generalizing this trend , we conclude that the degeneracy - lifting terms must correspond to linked clusters of a non - trivial topology , with the smallest cluster consisting of a hexagon loop and generated by the seventh - order process depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rspt](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> one example of the operator sequence is given by @xmath49 and contains five double - flips and two single - flips . </S>",
    "<S> this type of processes yields the only relevant seventh - order contribution at @xmath50 , for which the amplitude @xmath51 of the spin - flip hopping @xmath52 ( [ h_rspt ] ) vanishes together with the rest of the degeneracy - lifting terms . </S>",
    "<S> the energy correction at @xmath50 corresponds to an effective antiferromagnetic coupling between the second - neighbor spins @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath53 @xcite , favoring the @xmath1 state .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can show that for @xmath54 all relevant seventh - order processes have the same sign and also favor the @xmath1 state . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath55 , some of the terms switch sign . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the transition to the @xmath2 state can take place only at some @xmath56 , in agreement with the the non - linear swt result @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are close parallels between the non - linear swt and the real - space approach . </S>",
    "<S> although the degeneracy - lifting contribution in the rspt is of the seventh order , it is still of the second order in cubic terms , same as in the non - linear swt ( [ de3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the high order of the relevant perturbation processes explains the smallness of the quantum obd effect . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the rspt is an expansion in @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the coordination number , which gives the right order - of - magnitude estimate for the seventh - order effect @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> a more careful calculation using the actual perturbation terms in ( [ h_rspt ] ) and combinatorial factors of different processes of seventh order gives a similar answer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion on the topological nature of the effective exchange responsible for the ground - state selection also makes it extremely unlikely that a state with an extended unit cell can compete with the ones considered in this work .    </S>",

    "<S> for that , we calculate the ordered moment within the harmonic swt approximation , @xmath61 , to map out the extent of the magnetically ordered state . because of the degeneracy of classical 120@xmath13 states , harmonic spin - wave spectrum is identical in all of them and yields the same result . here </S>",
    "<S> we simply estimate stability of the nel order with respect to the `` diagonal '' quantum fluctuation for a given state . </S>",
    "<S> while this analysis completely neglects the `` off - diagonal '' tunneling within the manifold , such processes should be exponentially suppressed for larger spins @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> considering spin @xmath4 as a continuous variable , we plot @xmath67 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : rspt](d ) we also sketch results of the exact diagonalization ( ed ) for @xmath64 kgafm with the out - of - plane dm term @xcite , which selects @xmath1 ground state but yields harmonic hamiltonian identical to the @xmath0 case with rescaling @xmath72 @xcite . since the dm term suppresses tunneling processes within the manifold , it is reasonable to compare ed with swt results to evaluate the accuracy of the swt nel order boundary </S>",
    "<S> for the latter , one can see a qualitative agreement with ed and a quantitative exaggeration of the extent of the ordered phase , expected for the swt approach .    </S>",

    "<S> there are two trends that are not included in this phase diagram and are beyond the methods used in the current work . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linear swt approach is a perturbative treatment of the quantum obd effect , which fails in the vicinity of the heisenberg limit . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is known that quantum obd should extend nel - ordered region of the phase diagram to the @xmath9 axis for larger spin values . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued by the self - consistent version of swt @xcite that the @xmath2 is the ground state of the heisenberg kgafm for @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> the other trend is the suppression of the nel order by quantum fluctuations for smaller spins , leading to the growth of the non - magnetic region of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> as was argued recently by several groups using numerical approaches @xcite , the @xmath64 @xmath0 kgafm remains in a spin - liquid state for the entire range of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> our results for @xmath64 case in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phd](a ) are , therefore , inadequate , most likely because of the neglect of the tunneling between different states in 120@xmath13 manifold . in order to capture some of these trends we modify the mean - field condition @xmath73 used above by including the self - consistently renormalized spin - wave dispersion of the `` flat mode '' for the heisenberg limit from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while this is not an entirely rigorous procedure , it should provide a reasonable estimate on the extent of the region of stability due to quantum obd for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting values for the `` critical '' @xmath76 , above which the system orders magnetically , come out as @xmath77 and @xmath78 . while , obviously , this is another case of quantitative exaggeration of the extent of the ordered phase by an swt approach , this estimate makes it extremely unlikely that the heisenberg kgafm with @xmath79 will be magnetically disordered . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , recent numerical work @xcite has indicated that the heisenberg kgafms with @xmath80 all order in a @xmath2 configuration .    combining these trends , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a tentative @xmath70 phase diagram of the nearest - neighbor @xmath0 kgafm model in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phd](b ) . in the heisenberg limit , for larger values of spin the ground state is @xmath2 state , which switches to @xmath1 upon reducing @xmath5 . for @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> the same trajectory begins with the magnetically disordered state and the system enters directly into the @xmath1 state . as shown by the recent numerical results , @xmath64 remains quantum disordered for the entire range of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , there may , or may not , exist an intermediate value of spin for which heisenberg limit is already in the @xmath1 domain and no transition occurs versus @xmath5 . while predictions of this work are firm for the larger values of spin , the ultimate answer on the exact sequence of phases for smaller spins should be sought via numerical approaches .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions._by advancing the non - linear @xmath12 expansion and the real - space perturbation theory we investigated quantum order - by - disorder selection of the ground state of the nearest - neighbor @xmath0 antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice . </S>",
