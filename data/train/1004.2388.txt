    "it is known that the deficit of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos are due to neutrino oscillations among three flavors of neutrinos , and these observations offer evidence of neutrino masses and mixings.@xcite the standard three flavor framework of neutrino oscillations are described by six oscillation parameters : three mixing angles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the two independent mass squared differences @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and one cp violating phase @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 stands for the mass of the neutrino mass eigenstate . from the solar neutrino data , we have @xmath12 , and from the atmospheric neutrino data we have @xmath13 . on the other hand , only the upper bound on @xmath5 is known ( @xmath14 ) , is found .",
    "this result , however , is compatible with @xmath15 at less than @xmath16 , and it is not yet statistically significant enough to be taken seriously . ] and no information on @xmath9 is known at present .    to determine @xmath5 and @xmath9 , various neutrino long baseline experiments have been proposed@xcite , and the ongoing and proposed future neutrino long baseline experiments with an intense beam include conventional super ( neutrino ) beam experiments such as t2k,@xcite no@xmath17a,@xcite lbne,@xcite t2kk,@xcite the @xmath18 beam proposal,@xcite which uses a @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) beam from @xmath18-decays of radioactive isotopes , and the neutrino factory proposal,@xcite in which @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath19 and @xmath22 ) are produced from decays of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "as in the case of the b factories@xcite , precise measurements in these experiments allow us not only to determine the oscillation parameters precisely but also to probe new physics by looking for deviation from the standard three flavor scheme .",
    "in particular , test of unitarity is one of the important subjects in neutrino oscillations , and tau detection is crucial for that purpose . among the proposals for future long baseline experiments , the neutrino factory facility produces a neutrino beam of the highest neutrino energy , and it is advantageous to detect @xmath25 , because of the large cross section at high energy .",
    "new physics which has been discussed in the context of neutrino oscillation includes sterile neutrinos,@xcite the non - standard interactions during neutrino propagation@xcite , the non - standard interactions at production and detection@xcite , violation of unitarity due to heavy particles@xcite , etc .",
    "these scenarios , except the non - standard interactions during neutrino propagation , offer interesting possibilities for violation of three flavor unitarity . among these possibilities ,",
    "phenomenological bound of unitarity violation is typically of @xmath26(1% ) in the case of non - standard interactions at production and detection , and it is of @xmath26(0.1% ) in the case of unitarity violation due to heavy particles.@xcite on the other hand , the bound in the case of sterile neutrinos is of @xmath26(10% ) which comes mainly from the constraints of the atmospheric neutrino data,@xcite so scenarios with sterile neutrinos seem to be phenomenologically more promising to look for than other possibilities of unitarity violation .",
    "in this talk i will discuss phenomenology of schemes with sterile neutrinos at a neutrino factory .",
    "schemes with sterile neutrinos have attracted a lot of attention since the lsnd group announced the anomaly which suggest neutrino oscillations with mass squared difference of @xmath26(1ev@xmath27).@xcite .",
    "the reason that we need one extra neutrino to account for lsnd is because the standard three flavor scheme has only two independent mass squared differences , i.e. , @xmath28ev@xmath27 for the solar neutrino oscillation , and @xmath29ev@xmath27 for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation , and it does not have room for the mass squared difference of @xmath26(1ev@xmath27 ) . and",
    "the reason that the extra state has to be sterile neutrino , which is singlet with respect to the gauge group of the standard model , is because the number of weakly interacting light neutrinos has to be three from the lep data.@xcite the lsnd anomaly has been tested by the miniboone experiment , and it gave a negative result for neutrino oscillations with mass squared difference of @xmath26(1ev@xmath27).@xcite while the miniboone data disfavor the region suggested by lsnd , ref .   gave the allowed region from the combined analysis of the lsnd and miniboone data , and it is not so clear whether the miniboone data alone are significant enough to exclude the lsnd region . on the other hand , even if the miniboone data are taken as negative evidence against the lsnd region , there still remains a possibility for sterile neutrino scenarios whose mixing angles are small enough to satisfy the constraints of miniboone and the other negative results .",
    "the effect of these scenarios could reveal as violation of three flavor unitarity in the future neutrino experiments .",
    "so in this talk i will discuss sterile neutrino schemes as one of phenomenologically viable possibilities for unitarity violation , regardless of whether the lsnd anomaly is excluded by the miniboone data or not .    it has been known that sterile neutrino schemes may have cosmological problems ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    ". however , these cosmological discussions depend on models and assumptions , and i will not discuss cosmological constraints in this talk . also it has been pointed out that some sterile neutrino models@xcite have absorption effects even for neutrino energy below 1tev , but i will not take such effects into consideration for simplicity .",
    "for simplicity i will discuss schemes with four neutrinos , although phenomenology of the schemes with two@xcite or three@xcite sterile neutrinos have also been discussed . denoting sterile neutrinos as @xmath30 , we have the following mixing between the flavor eigen states @xmath31 and the mass eigenstates @xmath32 : @xmath33 there are two kind of schemes with four neutrinos , depending on how the mass eigenstates are separated by the largest mass squared difference .",
    "one is the ( 2 + 2)-scheme in which two mass eigenstates are separated by other two , and the other one is the ( 3 + 1)-scheme in which one mass eigenstate is separated by other three ( cf .",

    "-0.5 cm      in this scheme the fraction of sterile neutrino contributions to solar and atmospheric oscillations is given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , where the mass squared differences @xmath7 and @xmath36 are assumed to be those of the solar and atmospheric oscillations .",
    "the experimental results show that mixing among active neutrinos give dominant contributions to both the solar and atmospheric oscillations ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . in particular , in fig .",
    "19 of ref .",
    "we can see that at the 99% level @xmath37 and @xmath38 , from the solar and atmospheric oscillations , respectively , and this contradicts the unitarity condition @xmath39 .",
    "in fact the ( 2 + 2)-schemes are excluded at 5.1@xmath40 cl @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is independent of whether we take the lsnd data into consideration or not and i will not consider ( 2 + 2)-schemes in this talk .",
    "phenomenology of the ( 3 + 1)-scheme is almost the same as that of the standard three flavor scenario , as far as the solar and atmospheric oscillations are concerned . on the other hand",
    ", this scheme has tension between the lsnd data and other negative results of the short baseline experiments . among others ,",
    "the cdhsw@xcite and bugey@xcite experiments give the bound on @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , and in order for the lsnd data to be affirmative , the following relation has to be satisfied@xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the value of the effective two - flavor mixing angle as a function of the mass squared difference @xmath47 in the allowed region for lsnd ( @xmath48 ) , the cdhsw experiment ( @xmath49 ) , and the bugey experiment ( @xmath50 ) , respectively .",
    "the ( 3 + 1)-scheme to account for lsnd in terms of neutrino oscillations is disfavored because eq .",
    "( [ relation31 ] ) is not satisfied for any value of @xmath47 .",
    "this argument has been shown quantitatively by ref .   including the atmospheric neutrino data and other negative results . in fig.[aba : fig2 ] the right hand side of the lines denoted as `` null sbl 90% ( 99% ) '' is the excluded region at 90% ( 99% ) cl by the atmospheric neutrino data and all the negative results of short baseline experiments , whereas the allowed region by the combined analysis of the lsnd and miniboone data at 90% ( 99% ) cl is also shown .    in the following discussions i will assume the mass pattern depicted in fig.[aba : fig1](b ) because the inverted ( 3 + 1)-scheme is disfavored by cosmology , and",
    "i will also assume for simplicity that the largest mass squared difference @xmath51 is larger than @xmath52(0.1ev@xmath27 ) , so that i can average over rapid oscillations due to @xmath51 in the long baseline experiments as well as in the atmospheric neutrino observations .",
    "-1.0 cm -0.3 cm",
    "unlike conventional long baseline neutrino experiments , neutrino factories use muon decays @xmath53 and @xmath54 to produce neutrinos . in the setup suggested in the physics report@xcite of _ international scoping study for a future neutrino factory and super - beam facility _ , muons of both polarities are accelerated up to @xmath55 gev and injected into one storage ring with a geometry that allows to aim at two far detectors , the first located at 4000 km and the second at 7500 km from the source .",
    "the reason to put far detectors at two locations is to resolve so - called parameter degeneracy.@xcite the useful channels at neutrino factories are the following :    @xmath56 @xmath0 and @xmath57 : the golden channel    @xmath56 @xmath1 and @xmath58 : the disappearance channel    @xmath56 @xmath2 and @xmath59 : the silver channel    @xmath56 @xmath3 and @xmath60 : the discovery channel    at neutrino factories , electrons and positrons produced out of @xmath19 and @xmath61 create electromagnetic showers , which make it difficult to identify their charges . on the other hand ,",
    "charge identification is much easier for @xmath62 detection , so the golden channel @xmath0 is used unlike the conventional long baseline neutrino experiments which use @xmath63 .",
    "the golden channel turns out to be powerful because of very low backgrounds .",
    "the disappearance channel is also useful because of a lot of statistics .",
    "the golden and disappearance channels are observed by looking for muons with magnetized iron calorimeters.@xcite on the other hand , the silver and discovery channels are observed by looking for @xmath64 s with emulsion cloud chambers ( nonmagnetized@xcite or magnetized@xcite ) , and the statistics of the silver channel is limited .",
    "the silver channel is useful to resolve parameter degeneracy .",
    "combination of the golden , disappearance and discovery channels is expected to enable us to check unitarity .",
    "studied sensitivity of a neutrino factory with far detectors to sterile neutrino mixings .",
    "the setup is the following:=3000 km and @xmath65=7500 km , and it was shown that sensitivity with @xmath64 detectors increases for 50gev because of higher statistics . in this talk , however , i will only mention the results for the neutrino factory with muon energy 20gev for simplicity . ]",

    "the oscillation probability in constant - density matter can be obtained by the formalism of kimura , takamura and yokomakura@xcite .",
    "the oscillation probability in matter can be written as @xmath67 -2 mm where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the energy eigenvalue and the neutrino mixing matrix element in matter defined by @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "it can be shown that the 4-th component @xmath89 in matter is the same as that in vacuum : @xmath90 , where the notation @xmath91 has been also introduced for the quantity in vacuum .",

    "if the sterile neutrino mixings @xmath96 are small , then @xmath97 reproduce those for the standard three flavor case",
    ". these sterile neutrino mixings @xmath98 appear in the coefficients @xmath97 in front of the sine factors @xmath99 , so we can get information on the sterile neutrino mixings from precise measurements of the coefficients of the oscillation mode @xmath100 , which are the dominant contribution to the probability .",
    "we have evaluated sensitivity numerically by taking matter effects into account , and the results are given in figs.[aba : fig2]-[aba : fig5 ] . since we have assumed @xmath101ev@xmath27 ) , the results for @xmath102 ev@xmath27 are not given in the figures .",
    "the advantage of measurements with the far detectors is that sensitivity is independent of @xmath103 and it is good even for lower values of @xmath103 in most cases . in particular , in the case of the golden channel @xmath104 , the far detectors improve the present bound on @xmath105 by two orders of magnitude for all the values of @xmath101ev@xmath27 ) .",
    "the neutrino factory with far detectors , therefore , can provide a very powerful test of the lsnd anomaly .",
    "their disadvantage of measurements with the far detectors is that sensitivity is not as good as that of the near detectors , which will be described in the next subsection , at the peak .",
    "-0.3 cm    -3 mm    -3 mm      in my talk i skipped the discussions on sensitivity of a neutrino factory with near detectors , but because of recent interest on the near detector issues,@xcite i will describe sensitivity of measurements with near detectors for the sake of completeness . in ref .",
    "sensitivity of a neutrino factory with near detectors to sterile neutrino mixings was studied .",
    "the setup used in this analysis is the following : the muon energy is 20gev , the number of useful muons is @xmath106 @xmath23 s per year , the measurements are supposed to continue for 5 years , the volume of a magnetized iron calorimeter at the distance @xmath65=40 km is 40kton , that of an emulsion cloud chamber at @xmath65=1 km is 1kton , and the statistical errors and the backgrounds are taken into account .    at such short baselines , latexmath:[$|\\delta m^2_{41}l/2e|\\sim{\\cal o}(1)\\gg    only relevant mass squared difference is @xmath51 .",
    "so we have the following oscillation probabilities : @xmath108 thus we can determine @xmath109 or @xmath110 from the coefficient of the dominant oscillation mode @xmath111 .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[aba : fig2]-[aba : fig5 ] .",
    "the mass squared difference for which this neutrino factory setup has the best performance depends on the baseline length @xmath65 , and in the present case it is approximately 10ev@xmath27 .",
    "the advantage of measurements with the near detectors is that sensitivity to the sterile neutrino mixings is very good at the peak while their disadvantage is that sensitivity becomes poorer for lower values of @xmath51 . from these results ,",
    "we conclude that the near and far detectors are complementary in their performance .",
    "the results in the previous section suggest that the discovery channel @xmath3 may not be so powerful in giving the upper bound on the mixing angles . to see the role of the discovery channel ,",
    "let us now consider the effects of the cp phases in neutrino oscillations",
    ".      in matter t violation @xmath112 is more useful than cp violation @xmath113 , so i will discuss t violation in four neutrino schemes . , and the second term is proportional to @xmath114 in the standard three flavor framework@xcite in constant - density matter , as in the case in vacuum .",
    "so t violation is phenomenologically suitable to examine @xmath9 . in the case of cp violation , on the other hand",

    "the explicit forms of the mixing matrix elements @xmath144 can be found in the appendix a in ref .  .",
    "from the constraints of the short baseline reactor experiments and the atmospheric neutrino data , these angles are constrained as@xcite @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "if we assume the upper bounds for @xmath142 and @xmath5 , for which we have @xmath148 , then together with the best fit values for the solar and atmospheric oscillation angles @xmath149 , @xmath150 , we obtain the following jarlskog factor : @xmath151 for the ( 3 + 1)-scheme , where @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "these results should be compared with the standard jarlskog factor : @xmath154 notice that the jarlskog factor is independent of the flavor @xmath155 in the three flavor case .",
    "assuming that all the cp phases are maximal , i.e. , @xmath156 note that the term which would reduce to the three flavor t violation in the limit @xmath157 is contained in eq.([j4 ] ) as a subdominant contribution which is suppressed by @xmath158 . from this",
    "we see that dominant contribution to t violation in the ( 3 + 1)-scheme could be potentially much larger when measured with the discovery channel than that in the ( 3 + 1)-scheme with the golden channel or than that in the standard three flavor scheme .",
    "in fact it was shown in ref .   by a detailed analysis that the cp phase may be measured using the discovery and disappearance channels .      in generic",
    "see - saw models the kinetic term gets modified after integrating out the right handed neutrino and unitarity is expected to be violated.@xcite in the case of the so - called minimal unitarity violation , in which only three light neutrinos are involved and sources of unitarity violation are assumed to appear only in the neutrino sector , deviation from unitarity is strongly constrained from the rare decays of charged leptons . expressing the nonunitary mixing matrix @xmath159 as @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is a unitary matrix while @xmath162 is a hermitian matrix which stands for deviation from unitarity , the bounds are typically @xmath163(0.1% )  @xcite .",
    "the cp asymmetry in this scenario in the two flavor framework can be expressed as@xcite @xmath164 the constraint on @xmath165 is weaker that than on @xmath166 , and it was shown@xcite that the cp violating phase arg@xmath167 may be measured at a neutrino factory with the discovery channel .",
