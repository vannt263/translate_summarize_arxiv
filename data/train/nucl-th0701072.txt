    "in intermediate energy nuclear collisions , a hot nuclear system is initially produced in unstable equilibrium , generally in a compressed state .",
    "the unbalanced thermal and compressional pressure push the system towards expansion , till an equilibrium configuration is reached . if the system is sufficiently excited ( above a few mev per nucleon ) , the mononuclear configuration is ultimately driven towards a subnuclear density ( break - up density @xmath1 ) below which it no longer remains in the said configuration and undergoes disassembly into a number of fragments .",
    "study of the properties of hot nuclear systems at subnormal densities is of utmost physical interest in understanding explosive nucleosynthesis in supernova explosions @xcite , it plays a decisive factor in the element composition in the heavenly bodies .",
    "nuclear multifragmentation studies in the laboratory serve as a window to have a closer look at these processes ; the properties of the diluted nuclear material prior to fragmentation have a key role in such an understanding .",
    "it further helps in mapping the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and also extracting , from the complex experimental data , the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite that are crucial inputs in detailing the supernova explosion and discerning the properties of neutron star matter .    from experimental and theoretical studies",
    ", it is seen that the break - up density @xmath1 decreases with increasing excitation energy . since this density has a profile , use of a single value of it leaves some room for ambiguity . in experimental studies ,",
    "it is understood as an average density .",
    "there are several experimental estimates of the break - up density .",
    "this has been determined from the studies of correlation functions of emitted light particles from the source @xcite , but the results seem to depend on the choice of the pair of correlated light fragments .",
    "it raises the question on the representation of the evolutionary stage of the reaction process as given by the correlation data and thus there remains a latitude for considerable uncertainties .",
    "the systematics of the coulomb barriers required to fit the intermediate mass ejectile spectra also give an estimate of the break - up densities @xcite .",
    "however , in this extraction process , it is implicitly assumed that the barrier corresponds to a binary system @xcite , contrary to the fact that the hot system disassembles into many fragments .",
    "this introduces doubts in the proper estimation of the break - up densities .",
    "recently , the break - up densities have also been derived from the analysis of apparent level density parameters required to fit the measured caloric curves @xcite ; the extraction , however , hinges on a suitable mix of theory @xcite with experiment .",
    "the deduced break - up densities from different sets of experimental data have sometimes wide variations among them , a sound knowledge of these densities is thus still incomplete .",
    "the disassembly of a mononuclear configuration at excitations above @xmath2 mev / u has been theoretically studied in a statistical framework for more than the last two decades .",
    "there have been a variety of these models @xcite , the basic underlying premise is that the excited nuclear system expands to a _ freeze - out _ volume and then the system undergoes a one - step _ prompt multifragmentation _ , the fragmentation pattern being determined by the available phase space .",
    "it is assumed that both thermal and chemical equilibrium are established among the fragments at the freeze - out density @xmath1 so that the fragmentation pattern is frozen out there . in most of these models , the freeze - out density is independent of the excitation energy .",
    "different models , however , use widely varying freeze - out densities . whereas in the canonical or microcanonical models @xcite , the density @xmath1 is @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the nuclear saturation density ) , the corresponding quantity in the lattice - gas model @xcite is @xmath5 . this wide uncertainty in both the theoretical and experimental arena has prompted in recent times to have a closer look on the dependence of the nuclear density with excitation @xcite .",
    "these calculations depend on the experimental premise that the hot systems formed in nuclear collisions are isolated systems having a fixed excitation energy ( microcanonical ensemble ) ; for equilibrium , they are driven to an expanded configuration with the maximum entropy .",
    "the calculations of sobotka _ et al _",
    "@xcite on nuclear expansion with excitation are schematic in nature ; they employ a parametric form of the base density and then allow a self - similar expansion of the density to look for the maximum entropy configuration , the entropy being calculated in the fermi - gas model .",
    "in the calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the same physical picture was followed , however , a realistic effective hamiltonian was used to calculate the base density profile in a thomas - fermi framework .",
    "this renders the base density self - consistent and allows one to calculate the entropy microscopically ; furthermore , it offers the possibility of exploring the effect of the nuclear eos by using a variety of effective interactions which , however , was not reported .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , calculations were performed with the skyrme interaction ( skm@xmath6 ) for only one system , namely , @xmath7sm . for an expanding system pursuing the maximum entropy ,",
    "the surface diffuseness is likely to play a key role @xcite , a zero - range interaction like the skyrme force may possibly not be suitable for studying such a density profile .",
    "it has been reported @xcite that a constrained expanded system in a thomas - fermi approach leads to numerical instabilities and the gradient ( surface ) terms in the energy density functional were replaced with a suitable yukawa interaction @xcite . in the present communication , we report calculations using the modified seyler - blanchard ( sbm ) interaction @xcite ; it is of finite range and momentum and density dependent .",
    "different sets of sbm parameters yield different nuclear eos . in the present communication ,",
    "we have explored the role of nuclear eos on the observables related to an expanded mononuclear equilibrium configuration .",
    "we have further studied the isospin and mass dependence of the observables .",
    "in addition to expansion , a possible deformation along the expansion path might contribute additional entropy and mimics a fragmentation channel .",
    "we have considered volume - conserving quadrupole deformation to explore this aspect .",
    "the key tenets of the model have been reported in brief in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we present a somewhat more comprehensive account of the theoretical framework used in the present calculation .      in the experimental conditions , when two nuclei collide at intermediate energy , a hot nuclear system with a fixed number of neutrons and protons is formed in a nonequilibrium state .",
    "the system might also be compressed initially resulting in a collective flow in the decompression stage .",
    "we ignore the collective flow in the present calculation .",

    "2 ) , the density for the more symmetric system is higher ; the asymmetry effect on the density is seen to be more prominent for the heavier systems .",
    "it is further found that for the same asymmetry , the heavier systems have somewhat higher equilibrium density at a given excitation .",
    "it is noted that the two definitions used for the characterization of density yield values which are not much different for the lighter systems .",

    "the correlation ( caloric curve ) so obtained for the expanded hot nucleus @xmath7sm is displayed in fig .",
    "5 . at a fixed excitation energy ,",
    "the system cools down with expansion , and therefore the recorded temperature at the equilibrium configuration is significantly lower than that for the unexpanded nucleus prepared initially with the same excitation .",
    "in all of our calculations , the temperature refers to the canonical temperature .",
    "we have checked that the microcanonical temperature obtained from @xmath185 , is not much different from the canonical one . to explore the role of the eos on the correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the caloric curves obtained from both the softer ( @xmath159 mev ) and the harder ( @xmath186 mev ) eos are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that at a given @xmath9 , the equilibrium temperature is significantly higher , particularly at high excitations , for the stiffer eos .",
    "tentatively , this can be understood from the fact that the equilibrium density is higher for a harder eos ( fig .  1 ) ,",
    "the corresponding expansion is less and so more energy is locked in the thermal mode with a resultant higher temperature .",
    "the same conclusion is arrived at from the simplistic fermi - gas type framework presented in appendix - c .",
    "a representative set of experimental data @xcite for medium - mass nuclei are also shown in the figure .",
    "it is seen that the calculated caloric curve with the softer eos compares very well with the experimental data .",
    "the dashed curve represents the caloric curve without inclusion of correlation effects ( @xmath187 ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , introduction of correlation is seen to reduce the temperature for the equilibrium configuration at all excitation energies considered .",
    "the dependence of the nuclear caloric curve on mass and isospin asymmetry is shown in fig .",
    "the top panel refers to the heavier isobars and the bottom panel to the lighter ones .",
    "it is apparent from the figures that the caloric curves are nearly independent of asymmetry at lower excitations .",
    "for @xmath188 5 mev , the isospin dependence becomes increasingly prominent with increasing excitation , the equilibrium temperature is higher for the more symmetric system .",
    "the mass dependence on the caloric curve is seen from an examination of the results for pairs of nuclei which have almost the same asymmetry like sm and s or yb and ca .",
    "it is found that the equilibrium temperature for the lighter nuclei are comparatively always lower at all excitations .",
    "this behavior of the caloric curve with mass and isospin can be explained from the fact [ using eq .",
    "( 47 ) ] that for the same asymmetry , heavier nuclei have larger incompressibility ; also , for isobars , the ones with more asymmetry have an effectively lower incompressibility .",
    "the caloric curves show an interesting feature , namely , the occurrence of negative heat capacity , generally beyond an excitation energy @xmath189 mev .",
    "intuitively , one understands that if a system with a given excitation expands , it does so at the cost of thermal energy and hence there may be a density region when temperature may decrease with increasing excitation if the system expands much in pursuit of maximum entropy . in a simplistic model in appendix - c , we show that this occurs in the density region @xmath190 .",
    "it is also found that the more symmetric systems have lesser bends in the caloric curves ( for yb , in the excitation energy range explored , the bend shows up only later at @xmath19111 mev ) , this is because they offer more resistance towards volume expansion as already explained .",

    "as already stated , the more symmetric nuclei have effectively a harder eos , this is reflected in the comparatively lower expansion energy for these nuclei .",
    "it is seen that in general , the expansion energy comprises a significant part of the total excitation .",
    "the state with maximum entropy @xmath195 corresponds to the state with maximum probability .",
    "other configurations with different values of the scale parameter @xmath196 and temperature @xmath8 are also probable .",
    "their probability is determined by the entropy profile @xmath197 at a fixed excitation energy : @xmath198 the @xmath23th moment of the central density @xmath161 is then @xmath199 similarly , for the temperature @xmath8 one has @xmath200 equations ( 49 ) and ( 50 ) allow one to calculate the mean and the variance of @xmath161 and @xmath8 at a fixed excitation .",

    "11 , the average values of the specific volume @xmath204 ( = @xmath205 ) in units of @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) and their variances for the systems considered are shown .",
    "the equilibrium volume is found to be somewhat less than the average value . as in the case of temperature ,",
    "the fluctuations in volume rise smoothly up to an excitation energy @xmath203 9 mev , beyond which the build - up is very sudden .",
    "this sudden build - up is more pronounced in comparison to that in temperature for both light and heavy systems .",
    "this large density fluctuation indicates that beyond @xmath203 9 mev , the systems become unstable and break up into many pieces .",
    "it turns out that the negative branch of the heat capacity and the onset of large fluctuations occur at around the same excitation energy indicating a possible close correlation between them .    along with expansion",
    ", the excited nucleus may undergo deformation if that is profitable from the entropy considerations . from the interplay of coulomb and surface energies ,",
    "a barrier is found along the deformation path ; the barrier decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing density ( expansion ) . at a particular temperature , for the deforming system , in our calculations",
    "the scale parameter @xmath196 is taken such that the total excitation at the top of the barrier matches the given excitation @xmath158 .",
    "this is repeated for different temperatures and the maximum entropy among these different configurations is selected .",
    "if this entropy exceeds that for the expanded spherical equilibrium configuration , then deformation is favored leading to the fragmentation channel .",
    "the extra entropy @xmath208 gained from deformation over that at spherical equilibrium shape is displayed in the upper panels of fig .",

    "as mentioned , we have considered a volume - conserving quadrupole deformation . for",
    "@xmath158 less than @xmath209 4 mev , @xmath208 is negative in the restricted deformation space chosen ; it is thus seen that only above this excitation domain , fragmentation resulting from deformation is more favorable .",
    "with deformation , the maximum entropy configuration occurs at a lower temperature at a given excitation ; the corresponding caloric curves are shown in the bottom panels .",
    "in all the calculations , it is found that the oblate shapes are inhibited due to their lower entropy .",
    "in the present work , the gross features of an expanding mononuclear configuration at moderate and higher excitations have been dealt with in a semi - microscopic framework . a finite range ,",
    "momentum and density dependent realistic effective interaction has been employed for our investigation .",
    "renormalization of the nucleon mass coming from the coupling of the single - particle motion with the surface degrees of freedom is seen to play an important role in the correlation of entropy with excitation in a microcanonical formulation , this has been taken into account phenomenologically to avoid complexity .",
    "the density dependence in the interaction leaves room to vary the nuclear equation of state well within the ambits of accepted nuclear parameters .",
    "we have explored the influence of the eos on mononuclear observables and find that at a fixed excitation , a nucleus with a softer eos has more expansion , the corresponding expansion energy is found to be larger and thus its effective temperature is comparatively lower .",
    "the resultant mononuclear caloric curve and equilibrium density compare very well with the experimental data with the chosen softer eos with nuclear incompressibility @xmath210  = 238 mev , which is close to its well - accepted value .",
    "we have further studied the mass and isospin dependence on the mononuclear observables . for nuclei with same asymmetry but higher mass",
    ", it is found that the system expands less and consequently has a higher temperature ; this is also true for nuclei with same mass but less asymmetry .",
    "all these observations could be explained from the fact that heavier and symmetric systems have effectively higher incompressibility .    in the experimentally constructed nuclear caloric curves",
    "@xcite , a plateau is observed in the excitation energy range @xmath211 mev/@xmath81 .",
    "this is indicative of infinite specific heat . in some analyses , a negative specific heat @xcite in this energy domain",
    "is also suggested .",
    "these are pointers to a possible liquid - gas phase coexistence . in our calculations ,",

    "the fluctuations in temperature and volume build up with excitation . the rapid growth of these fluctuations at @xmath203 9 mev is suggestive of the instability of the mononuclear configuration against prompt multifragmentation .",
    "the occurrence of the negative heat capacity and the sudden growth of fluctuations at around the same excitation energy indicate a close correlation between them .",
    "while expanding , the nuclear system may gain further entropy from fragmentation into a number of pieces , mostly from the generation of new surfaces .",

    "it is found that above @xmath203 4 mev , the systems generally favor deformation .",
