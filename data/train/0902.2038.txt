    "the emerging structures are characterized by an order parameter ( _ e.g. _ charge , spin or particle density ) that is modulated in space with a given wave vector @xmath0 . in particular , for 2d adsorbate systems , there is competition between the commensurate state which is favored by a strong periodic pinning potential and the cost of the elastic energy depending on the mismatch between the intrinsic lattice constant @xmath1 of the overlayer , and the period @xmath2 of the pinning potential .    while the static properties of c and i structures have been extensively characterized @xcite much less is known about their dynamics .",
    "a particularly interesting case arises when an initially  pinned phase is subjected to an external driving force @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting nonlinear response is relevant for a variety of different physical systems which are accessible experimentally .",

    "there appears to be a universal value which depends on the dimensionality of the system , provided inertial effects are negligible @xcite . for the case of an initially commensurate phase in a periodic pinning potential without disorder , a power - law exponent @xmath8",
    "is expected independent of the dimension  as the threshold behavior can be understood from the point of view of single particle behavior @xcite . in the limit of a large force @xmath9 the system is moving and the corresponding relationship between the driving force and the sliding velocity defines the sliding friction coefficient @xmath10    the simple frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite extended to two dimensions and other similar elastic models",

    "although these models take into account topological defects in the form of domain walls they leave out plastic deformations of the layer due to other defects such as dislocations .",
    "these defects are particularly important when the ci transition occurs between two different crystal structures , or in presence of thermal fluctuations or quenched disorder , and should be taken into account for a more realistic description of the system .",
    "such defects can be automatically included in a full microscopic model involving interacting atoms in the presence of a substrate potential using more realistic interaction potentials .",

    "when the driving depinning transition is discontinuous , hysteresis effects can occur which result in two different critical forces , @xmath11 , corresponding to the threshold values for increasing the force from zero and decreasing the force from a large value , respectively .",
    "a fundamental issue in modeling such systems is the origin of the hysteresis .",
    "it is well known that hysteresis can occur in underdamped systems , where inertia effects are present .",
    "however , molecular dynamics simulations of a 2d model of an adsorbed layer with lennard - jones interacting potential for increasing values of the damping coefficient ( microscopic friction ) and analytical arguments suggested that hysteresis should remain in the overdamped limit @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "results for the pure elastic fk model shows that although the hysteresis behavior is similar to lennard - jones model for weak damping , it disappears in the overdamped limit @xcite .",
    "the different behaviors could be due to the absence of some defects generated during the depinning transitions , which are allowed in the lennard - jones model but not in the elastic fk model .",
    "in fact , hysteresis can be argued to arise from topological defects in the lattice such as dislocations in two - dimensional systems @xcite even in the absence of inertial effects .",
    "one thus expects that overdamped dynamics should be able to described the hysteresis behavior in two dimensions provided the model incorporates both elastic and plastic deformations . for charge density waves , where the pinning potential is disordered",
    ", a field theoretical model has been introduced which allows for dislocations as well as thermal fluctuations @xcite through amplitude and phase fluctuations , and shows both elastic and hysteretic behavior in agreement with experiments @xcite . in absence of disorder ,",
    "however , the possible hysteresis behavior in such models has not been investigated .",
    "recently a phase field crystal ( pfc ) model was introduced @xcite that allows for both elastic and plastic deformations in the solid phase . in this formulation a free energy functional is introduced which depends on the field @xmath12 that corresponds to the particle number density averaged over microscopic times scales .",

    "length scales the model naturally includes elastic and plastic deformations , multiple crystal orientations and anisotropic structures in a manner similar to other microscopic approaches such as molecular dynamics .",
    "however , the pfc model describes the density on a diffusive and not the real microscopic times scales .",
    "it is therefore computationally much more efficient .    in our previous works",

    "@xcite  part of the phase diagram as function of pinning strength and lattice mismatch between the pinning potential and the pfc was mapped out .",
    "numerical minimization was used to find the minimum free - energy configurations and provide details on the topological defects in the boundary region .",
    "in particular , we found that the transition from the i to the c phase remains discontinuous for all values of the mismatch studied in ref .",
    "we also performed a detailed voronoi analysis of the defects throughout the transition region . in ref .",

    "@xcite is driven by an external force in the absence of thermal fluctuations . to this end , we first present improved detailed phase diagrams of the model both in 1d and 2d .",
    "the main focus of the present work is on the influence of an external driving force on the pinned c phase , which we study for different values of mismatch and pinning strengths for 1d and 2d systems .",
    "as expected , due to the competition between the pinning potential and the driving force there is a depinning transition at @xmath4 for a finite driving force @xmath3 .",
    "we demonstrate that within a certain range of parameters the depinning transitions are continuous , and find that both in 1d and 2d the corresponding power - law exponent is @xmath14 in agreement with the expected value @xcite .",
    "we also characterize structural changes of the system close to the depinning transition . for large pinning strength transverse depinning transitions in the moving state",
    "are also found .",
    "surprisingly , for sufficiently weak pinning potential we find a discontinuous depinning transition with hysteresis even in one dimension although overdamped dynamical equations are used .",

    "thus , the dynamical equation of motion for the phase field is given by @xmath32 for the forces considered in this work ( typically @xmath33 ) , the convective term does not change the average value of the density field .",
    "in contrast to the usual classical microscopic characterization of particle positions and velocities , the measurement of an average drift velocity in response to an external driving force @xmath34 requires some discussion . in the pfc model",
    "the maxima of the density field that define the lattice structure can not always be interpreted as individual particles , since vacancies may be present in the system .",
    "the conservation law in the model concerns the local density field , not the number of maxima in the field .",
    "this becomes evident in the driven pfc model , where the motion of the density field close to depinning may be more akin to flow in a continuous medium than the motion of discrete particle - like objects .",
    "thus , defining the drift velocity in terms of the density field maxima is computationally more demanding to implement .",
    "we have found that measuring the drift velocity @xmath5  from the rate of change of the gradient of the density field gives consistent results , in absence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "we have used the following definition    @xmath35    where the subscripts @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the brackets denote averaging over space and time , respectively .",

    "<S> we study numerically the phase diagram and the response under a driving force of the phase field crystal model for pinned lattice systems introduced recently for both one and two dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes the lattice system as a continuous density field in the presence of a periodic  pinning potential , allowing for both elastic and plastic deformations of the lattice .  </S>",
    "<S> we first  present  results for phase diagrams of the model in the absence of a driving force . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear response to a driving force on an initially pinned commensurate phase is then studied via overdamped dynamic equations of motion for different values of mismatch and pinning strengths . for large pinning strength </S>",
    "<S> the driven depinning transitions are continuous , and the sliding velocity varies with the force from the threshold with power - law exponents in agreement with analytical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> transverse depinning transitions in the moving state are also found in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , for sufficiently weak pinning potential we find a discontinuous depinning transition with hysteresis even in one dimension under overdamped dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also characterize structural changes of the system in some detail close to the depinning transition . </S>"
