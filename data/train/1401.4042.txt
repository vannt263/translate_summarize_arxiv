    "<S> these static diffraction patterns were obtained with thermoionic electrons in order to see the effect of the average heating induced by the laser . the charge / orbital ordering satellites , indicated in the figure , are found to first rotate at intermediate laser fluence , corresponding to an average heating that brings the sample temperature from 300 k to about 320 k , while they have completely disappeared for an average pump power of 100 mw ( 320 @xmath13j/@xmath14 ; the latter is the fluence used in our time - resolved experiments at which the sample is deeply in its metallic phase , at a temperature above 350 k ) . upon irradiating the sample with the laser at 1 mhz repetition - rate , an increase in the sample temperature was observed and stabilized within few minutes , indicating that a new equilibrium was reached at a temperature higher than room temperature itself . in this condition , it was verified that the system relaxes to such a new thermal equilibrium between subsequent pulses , as testified by the flat temporal dependence of the diffraction intensity before time - zero , in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> an exponential intensity drop of as much as 18@xmath20 with a time constant of 31 ps is observed ; this , according to the debye formula : @xmath21 would correspond to an average atomic displacement induced by the temperature jump of around 3@xmath20 of the interatomic distance . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 b , the change of the in - plane diagonal is shown ; an expansion of 3@xmath20 of the equilibrium value is indeed observed within the same time - scale ( obtained via an exponential fit to be 31 ps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the distortion of the @xmath22-axis lattice parameter also contributes to the dw effect and is expected to be of the same size . in the dynamics of the bragg peak intensity , an oscillation originating from the pressure - wave launched by the photoexcitation is visible . in this scenario </S>",

    "<S> it is possible to estimate the young modulus ( @xmath23 ) along the @xmath22-axis knowing the thickness and the density of the material through the formula that relates @xmath23 to the oscillation period of an ideal freely vibrating nanofilm : @xmath24 , with @xmath25 = 1 for the fundamental tone . for the single crystal used for diffraction , assuming a density that for manganites typically is around 6.5g/@xmath26 @xcite , we obtain a value of 113 gpa .    in electron energy loss spectroscopy , </S>",
    "<S> multiple scattering effects complicate the assignment of the different spectroscopic features by inducing broad satellite peaks @xcite . to avoid this problem , thinner samples must be used . for this reason , </S>",

    "<S> 3 a in the range from 0 to 700 ev . each region of this broad spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is modeled by theoretical calculations ; in particular , in the low loss region , between 0 and 70 ev , two plasmon peaks at 3 and 13 ev are observed and are assigned to the partial and the highly - damped valence electron plasmon respectively . at higher energy , </S>",
    "<S> the shallower core levels are found , such as the pr o@xmath27 at 20 ev , the sr n@xmath27 at 29 ev , the ca m@xmath27 34 ev and the mn m@xmath27 at 55 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this portion of the spectrum is modeled via state of the art dft calculations via wien2k code @xcite , see red line in fig . 3 a. </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are in reasonable agreement with the experiment , despite a shift of some of the electronic states already observed in previous reports @xcite . at 345 ev , </S>",
    "<S> the ca l@xmath27 is observed and the 3 ev spin - orbit splitting is evident on this edge . in the oxygen k - edge instead , the sharp peak at 524.4 ev originates from the hybridized states between o-2@xmath28 and mn-3@xmath29 orbitals , while two pronounced peaks centered at about 532 and 540 ev come from the hybridization of the o-2@xmath28 with pr / sr / ca and mn-4@xmath30/4@xmath28 states . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting between the valence band and upper hubbard band is invisible here , because it is smaller than the energy resolution ( @xmath19 1 ev in our fs - tem ) . in the dft calculations , red trace in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 a , only the strong feature originating from the pr - o hybridization at 533 ev is not captured . to simulate the mn l - edge , the atomic multiplets code </S>",
    "<S> is used @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the eels spectrum is simulated by a mixed valence state mn@xmath7 + mn@xmath8 , in a crystal field environment of 2.4 ev as estimated by the mn bands splitting in the high symmetry points of the fat bands diagram @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the broad experimental energy range provides a solid constraint to our modeling of the eels spectra , which we use to understand the following time - resolved experiments . upon light excitation , </S>",
    "<S> as shown in diffraction , the film undergoes a periodic structural modulation as well as an overall dilatation due to the light induced temperature jump . </S>",
    "<S> the period of the modulation depends on the sample thickness , its young modulus and density . for eels experiments , the 50 nm thick sample used gives rise to a faster oscillation of the dynamical spectra with a period of 23 ps . </S>",
    "<S> the overall energy - time map of the experimental data is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 b , where black lines indicate the energies corresponding to the different electronic states observed in the static spectra . </S>",
    "<S> each of these states shows a different temporal dynamics , reflecting a different sensitivity to the photoinduced structural distortions . </S>",
    "<S> this is better visible in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 c , where the temporal profile corresponding to each energy level is shown . here , an overall decay of the peak intensity is observed after time zero , with a periodic modulation superimposed . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that despite the overall effect is the weakest on the mn m - edge at 53 ev , the periodicity is the clearest at this energy , suggesting that the mn orbitals are the most sensitive to the structural distortions . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising considering the large crystal field on the mn ions , which we estimated from the band structure and the mn l - edge static spectrum , and that is certainly affected by the shape and dimension of the cage surrounding the mn ions .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the dynamical eels spectra , we performed dft calculations of the low - loss as well as the oxygen k - edge region for different structural parameters , reflecting the changes estimated by diffraction , i.e. an overall lattice expansion by few percents of its equilibrium value . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculate the spectrum for a compressed lattice , to verify the unambiguity of our interpretation . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 a , the difference spectra eels(compr .- ab ) - eels(equil . ) , eels(expand .- ab ) - eels(equil . ) , eels(compr .- c ) - eels(equil . ) and eels(expand .- c ) - eels(equil . ) are shown together with the experimental difference spectra eels(t@xmath31 ) - eels(t=0 ) and eels(t=50ps ) - eels(t=0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the transient change , i.e. a reduced eels intensity , is captured by the calculations that consider an expanded lattice after time zero . </S>",
    "<S> the overall shape of the transient spectrum is also reasonably reproduced by the calculated difference spectra with a good coincidence between the position and relative strength of the negative peaks ; the simulations consider a lattice expansion / compression in both @xmath15 and @xmath22 direction of 2@xmath20 , and estimate intensity changes of the eels features in the order of 3@xmath20 , and energy shifts in the order of 80 - 90 mev , close to what was observed in another layered solid , namely graphite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of these changes is in good agreement with the experimental observation ; the largest energy shift is observed at the ca edge , causing a positive peak in the low energy side of the edge , in the theoretical curve . while the intensity change is captured by the experiment , the small energy shift ( 80 mev ) </S>",
    "<S> is washed out by the overall energy resolution in time - resolved mode , around 2 ev . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> the sharp positive peak is not visible in our transient data ; the same situation was observed in previous time - resolved eels data @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 b , the same simulation is performed for the oxygen k - edge spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , while in the low loss region of the spectrum ( 1 - 70 ev ) an expansion of the in - plane or c - axis lattice parameters induces similar energy shifts and intensity changes of the different spectroscopic features , in the near - edge region of the oxygen k - edge , the behavior due to the in - plane or out of plane distortions is radically different . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the o k - edge is very sensitive to the local mn - o chemical bonding and consequently the orbital occupancy , while the low - loss spectra , including plasmons and other ionization edges , is mostly related to the bandwidth which depends on the volume expansion . in the charge </S>",
    "<S> / orbital ordered state , the orbital shape for mn@xmath7 sites is dominated by the low - lying in - plane ( 3x@xmath32-r@xmath32 ) / ( 3y@xmath32-r@xmath32)-type orbitals which can be rotated through pressure or temperature changes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , changes in the lattices parameters along different directions would result in different orbital reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our calculations also demonstrate that the expanded @xmath33 and @xmath34 lattice parameters lead to a decrease in the energy gap , while the expanded @xmath22-axis lattice parameter has the opposite effect , as shown in the inset of fig 4 b.    these results show that photoexcitation can be used to span the phase diagram of a manganite . in this particular case </S>",
    "<S> , we used light as a source of both continuous heating ( to drive the system into its metallic phase ) and to induce an ultrafast temperature jump in the material . </S>",
    "<S> the response to such a temperature jump was monitored via a combination of diffraction and eels to observe the interplay between structural and electronic effects in the metallic phase of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the only other ultrafst eels experiment ever performed on a solid reported a radically different behavior in the first few ps of the dynamics for the layered system graphite @xcite . in that case , a compression of the system was observed before thermal expansion would take place . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior was attributed to the anisotropic decay of the out - of - equilibrium electronic structure , due to the peculiar semi - metallic band structure of graphite @xcite . in our results , </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior was not observed within one ps resolution temporal scans . in eels </S>",
    "<S> , a compression of the interlayer distances would give a large change of the plasmons , as estimated by our ab - initio caluclations ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a , light blue trace ) and because the out - of - plane bonding in layered solids is usually weak , soft ( i.e. slow ) phonons are involved in its distortions . </S>",
    "<S> for these reasons , a compression that is stronger and faster then predicted is unlikely ( although not impossible ) ; for these reasons , our data do not suggest that the behavior observed in graphite is general to all layered systems . instead </S>",
    "<S> , a strong similarity between the layered manganite and graphite is observed in the long - time scale ( several ps ) . in both materials in fact , the light - induced thermal expansion is found to modulate the electronic structure in a similar way . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the low - loss energy range of the eels spectrum is shown to be able to discriminate between compression and expansion of the lattice , while being somewhat insensitive to the direction of the ionic motions , in - plane or out - of - plane . </S>",
    "<S> based on these results , we also predict that distortions of the @xmath15-plane or @xmath22-axis lattice parameters instead give very distinct spectroscopic signatures in the oxygen k - edge eel spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> these results provide a broad band direct observation of the interplay between the crystal and the electronic structure in a charge ordered manganite , and are the starting point for a deeper understanding of the different phase transitions in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , once the thermal effects are understood , it will be easier to distinguish dynamical electronic effects across charge ordering transitions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the fs dynamics of the orbital ordering rotation , as observed both via static conventional temperature dependent experiments , and the static photoinduced ones reported in fig . 1 is currently under investigation by the same technique .    </S>",
