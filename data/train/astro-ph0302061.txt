    "the effect of this dumping of energy is apparent across a broad range in wavelength .",

    "despite clear evidence of activity over the scale of clusters , the effect of cluster - cluster mergers on individual galaxies is less certain .",
    "mergers present complex environmental factors , including large galaxy - galaxy velocity dispersions and bulk flows of intracluster gas .",
    "what is the net effect of such factors on the evolution of member galaxies ?",
    "various models have investigated this question , but the large range in environmental parameters produces differing conclusions .",
    "@xcite evaluated the time - varying tidal effects on a disk galaxy whose parent group was being accreted by a cluster .",
    "his simulations indicated that cluster - group mergers could lead to star formation bursts in member galaxies through transfer of large amounts of gas from the galaxies disks to their nuclei .",
    "while the large relative velocities of galaxies in cluster - cluster mergers strongly inhibits direct galaxy - galaxy mergers , the cumulative effect of numerous high - speed passages of galaxies ( `` harrassment '' ) can also efficiently transfer gas to the galaxies nuclei and lead to enhanced star formation @xcite .",
    "however , these studies generally ignore the effect of the intracluster gas on member galaxies .",
    "pressure from this gas leads to competing effects : compression of the ism in the moving galaxies can enhance star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while removal of gas due to ram pressure stripping can squelch it .",
    "@xcite argued through simulations that the net effect of this was to reduce star formation in member galaxies during cluster - cluster mergers , although they did not specifically address the effect of shocks in the icm .",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed a complementary pair of clusters to investigate the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "these clusters were nearly identical in terms of their redshift and richness , yet radio and optical data showed that one possessed a high fraction of active galaxies while the other did not .",
    "the apparent cause was the dynamical state of the clusters , with the cluster containing more active galaxies being a strong merger candidate and the other cluster being more virialized .",
    "similarly , further observational clues may be hidden in studies of clusters at higher redshift .",
    "the morphs collaboration @xcite have studied ten intermediate redshift clusters to investigate galaxy evolution .",
    "they find evidence for increased activity in these clusters in the form of larger numbers of star - forming and post - starburst galaxies .",
    "however , the cnoc collaboration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent papers ) have studied clusters in a similar redshift range and seen significantly less evidence for such an effect .",
    "the primary difference in their studies is in how the samples were constructed , with the morphs clusters being identified optically and the cnoc clusters through x - ray luminosity .",
    "this biases the cnoc sample to more relaxed , virialized clusters , which could very well explain the differences in their member galaxy populations @xcite .",
    "the increased activity seen by the morphs collaboration could be the result of their clusters more frequently representing merger systems .    in this paper",
    ", we assess the radio galaxy population of one of the better nearby examples of a merger between two clusters of galaxies .",
    "a compelling body of evidence supporting this scenario has been compiled for abell 2255 , a northern hemisphere cluster at @xmath7 .",
    "the cluster shows an elongated x - ray distribution whose peak is offset from the optical center of the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and substructure in x - ray temperature maps of its intracluster gas @xcite .",
    "optically , the brighter galaxies are arranged in a chain , with the two brightest galaxies at the center of the cluster separated by nearly @xmath8 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this led to the hypothesis that abell 2255 was actually two separate clusters seen in projection @xcite , a result which appeared feasible given the small number of measured galaxy velocities at that time .",
    "additional velocity measurements argued that abell 2255 was , in fact , a bound system with an unusually high velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "even so , the total number of cluster galaxy velocities was modest and although no substructure was detected from these velocities the lack of data prohibited strongly dismissing its presence .",
    "recently , an enormous increase in the number of measured velocities has become available @xcite .",
    "these have enabled the detection of significant evidence for substructure and argue that abell 2255 is a dynamically - active cluster being assembled from numerous groups @xcite .",
    "lastly , radio observations of the cluster also note an unusual level of activity .",
    "several studies have noted a large number of head - tail radio galaxies in the cluster , as well as a diffuse radio halo @xcite .",
    "we have performed wide - field , high sensitivity radio observations of abell 2255 with the national radio astronomy observatory s ( nrao ) very large array ( vla ) .",
    "these observations encompassed the entire cluster , from its core out past the abell radius ( @xmath9 @xmath4mpc ) , and identified galaxies whose 1.4 ghz radio emission amounted to @xmath10 w hz@xmath1 and greater .",
    "this corresponds to all agn and galaxies forming stars at rates in excess of 1.8 m@xmath11 yr@xmath1 ( using the relation found in * ? ? ?",
    "the radio data are complemented by new wide - field optical images collected in @xmath12 , multiband photometry from the sloan digital sky survey early data release ( sdss edr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the spectroscopic databases of @xcite and the sdss edr .",
    "consequently , we are able to explore the effect of the cluster merger on galaxies down to a very low level of activity .",
    "the results for abell 2255 are then compared against a large sample of nearby clusters @xcite , demonstrating the unusual properties of the cluster .",
    "the results are discussed in light of various models for galaxy evolution in cluster environments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : obs ] , we discuss the data .",
    "this includes details about the observations and reductions for both the radio and optical data , and a discussion of the optical spectroscopy data which were used .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , including an overview of the cluster radio galaxy population , an analysis of how the radio galaxies are distributed , and statistical comparisons of the radio galaxy population of abell 2255 relative to other nearby clusters .",
    "these findings are discussed in light of cluster evolutionary models in section [ sec : discuss ] , and final conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we have adopted @xmath13 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath14 , meaning 1 corresponds to 1.28 kpc at abell 2255 .",
    "radio observations at 1.4 ghz were made with the vla in two configurations .",
    "the higher resolution observations were performed during july 1998 while the vla was in its b configuration , and lower resolution observations were performed during may 1999 in the d configuration .",
    "the b configuration provides a resolution of @xmath155 but is insensitive to structures larger than @xmath15120 .",
    "abell 2255 is known to possess a number of extended radio galaxies as well as diffuse emission unassociated with individual galaxies @xcite , necessitating the inclusion of the lower resolution d array data .",
    "the observational strategy paralleled that of other wide - field radio surveys ( e.g. , the nvss and first ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a grid of 25 pointings was used to cover the cluster from its core out to large radii ( @xmath1640 , or about 3 mpc ) .",
    "these pointings were arranged in a hexagonal pattern , with the primary 19 pointings having a grid spacing of 16 .",
    "the remaining 6 pointings formed a smaller hexagon surrounding the central pointing of the main grid .",
    "this configuration was adopted to provide near - uniform sensitivity across the cluster , with extra detail in the cluster core .",
    "for an excellent overview of the technique , from observation through to construction of the final wide - field image , the reader is directed to @xcite .",
    "both b and d array observations were made in `` line mode '' to greatly reduce bandwidth smearing .",
    "this is also required in order to properly `` clean '' sources away from the pointing center , thereby reducing the noise caused by confusion .",
    "thus , seven channels of 3.125mhz bandwidth were used for each intermediate frequency and polarization .",
    "the integration time for each pointing was 17 minutes while in the b configuration , and 8.5 minutes in d. the pointings were made at the same hour angle for both b and d to facilitate combining the uv data and to correct for the `` 3d effect . ''",
    "data reduction was performed using nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "flux calibration was performed via observation of 3c286 , and the flux density scale should be accurate to @xmath17 @xcite . the flux density scale was further confirmed via comparison with nvss fluxes for unresolved sources .",
    "calibration of both the individual bandpasses and the phases was provided by observations of 3c343 , performed roughly every hour .",
    "this source is located approximately 4@xmath18 from the center of abell 2255 .",
    "the pointings were each reduced individually using the aips task imagr .",
    "the first step involved determining the optimal choices of parameters to satisfy the dual considerations of minimizing noise and insuring consistent beam shapes across all pointings .",
    "three parameters were varied , corresponding to the weighting of the uv data ( ranging from uniform to natural ) , smoothing of the uv data , and applying various gaussian tapers to the uv data .",
    "an image for each pointing was then created after applying a strong taper to the data ( i.e. , devaluing the longer baselines to create a lower resolution map extending well past the first null in the primary beam ) .",
    "this image was used to identify flanking sources falling in the beam s sidelobes , which is necessary to properly remove their contributions in the primary beam .",
    "once identified , coordinates for the flanking sources were obtained from the nvss , which has properly treated the shift in apparent position due to the 3d effect .    producing the final maps for each pointing",
    "was then performed iteratively .",
    "the b - array data were reduced first , followed by the d - array data .",
    "the primary beam was imaged in four separate facets to reduce the 3d effect , with flanking sources boxed and cleaned .",
    "the resulting maps were inspected and all sources boxed , followed by a second imaging of the uv data . the output of this run",
    "was then used to self - calibrate the uv data ( phases only ) , with the new self - calibrated data then being used in another imaging run .",
    "the output of this run was then used to further self - calibrate the data ( now on both amplitude and phase ) , and the resulting uv data was inspected and interference excised .",
    "any new faint sources which had appeared in the images were boxed , and a semi - final imaging of the modified uv data was performed .",
    "the net result of these steps was typically a reduction of @xmath19 in the noise relative to the initial mapping .",
    "once this point had been reached for both the b and d array datasets , the two were combined into a single uv dataset and imaged .",
    "a circular restoring beam of 5.9 was used to create the final images for each pointing .",
    "the reduced images for each pointing were then stitched together to form the final mosaic maps .",
    "this was performed by weighting each location in a given pointing by its s / n , which is just the power pattern of the primary beam . in this step , each map was truncated at @xmath20 of the primary beam ( about 20 ) .",
    "thus , locations at the pointing centers receive full weight in the final output map whereas locations distant from the pointing centers are devalued .",
    "the final mosaic had an rms noise of about 30 @xmath21jy beam@xmath1 in the center .",
    "at the very edges , where fewer individual pointings contribute to the mosaic , the noise level was still only @xmath22 @xmath21jy beam@xmath1 .",
    "our radio maps do not successfully image the extended diffuse radio halo .",
    "its presence is likely indicated by a slight increase in the rms noise in the regions of the map where it should be located ( from around 30 @xmath21jy to just under 40 @xmath21jy ) .",
    "the aips task sad ( `` search and destroy '' ) was used to identify sources in the final mosaic .",
    "this task was directed to locate all sources with peak fluxes greater than four times the rms noise level determined over the surrounding @xmath23 .",
    "sad fits these sources with gaussians and notes their positions and fluxes .",
    "it also creates a residual map , which was inspected to locate any extended sources not well fit by gaussians .",
    "these were manually added to the lists , with fluxes determined directly by boxing the sources . each radio source",
    "was then inspected , and only those with either peak or integral fluxes greater than five times the local noise ( over the surrounding 5 ) were included in the final radio source lists . in total , the radio source list contained over 1200 members .",
    "optical images ( @xmath12 ) of abell 2255 were obtained during july 1999 using the kpno 0.9 meter telescope .",
    "these were taken with the mosaic camera , providing a 59 field at a pixel scale of 0.43 . to cover the spacings between the eight individual chips in mosaic , we adopted the standard dither sequence of five images per telescope pointing .",
    "the wide field of mosaic allowed abell 2255 to be imaged well past its abell radius in only four pointings . a fifth , deeper pointing",
    "was centered on the cluster core .",
    "the net exposure time was 750 seconds for each of the four shallower images and 1500 seconds for the deeper central pointing .",
    "observations of three landolt selected areas @xcite were performed at a range of airmass ( 1.2 to 2.3 ) to provide photometric calibration .",
    "the reductions were done following the steps suggested in the noao ccd mosaic imager user manual .",
    "a sequence of eight bias frames were stacked to create a superbias , and a flat field to handle pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations in the ccds was created from a set of eight dome flats .",
    "the wide field of mosaic presents an additional challenge in flat fielding . to produce a flat which accurately corrects for the illumination pattern of the telescope and detector ,",
    "all of the night s target exposures were used ( including observations of standards and another cluster , abell 2256 ) .",
    "these were scaled by their modes and stacked after careful rejection of peaks ( cosmic rays , stars , and galaxies ) to create a sky flat .",
    "this sky flat was then boxcar smoothed to approximately the same signal - to - noise as the dome flat .",
    "the ccdproc task in the mscred package was then used to overscan subtract , bias subtract , flat field , and trim the raw images using the aforementioned calibration frames .",
    "the five dithers for an individual pointing were then combined , with relative astrometry determined using @xmath1550 stars per field .",
    "the rms coordinate shifts among the dither images were less than 0.3 pixels .",
    "the stars also were used to match the intensity scales of the five dithered images , which were consistent to well under @xmath24 as would be expected for photometric conditions .    the three landolt selected areas provided a total of @xmath25 standard stars for photometric calibration .",
    "these were used to fit the dependence of magnitude on airmass , but no color term was applied .",
    "the derived relationship was @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the instrumental magnitude , @xmath28 is the airmass , @xmath29 is the time , and @xmath30 a constant",
    ". comparison of derived magnitudes for the standard stars vs. their published values suggests the photometry is accurate to within 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "astrometric registration for the images was performed using the usno a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "the usno a2.0 catalog is the optimal choice for the astrometry , as its coordinate system is tied to the radio reference frame using distant quasars .",
    "the catalog also includes faint stars , which are an improvement over the brighter hst guide star catalog stars because they will not be saturated in the images .",
    "the use of saturated stars leads to errors in fitted centers and consequently less accurate registration .",
    "several hundred usno a2.0 stars were used per mosaic field .",
    "the coordinate solution relative to these stars was determined , and any stars which produced large residuals relative to this fit were removed ( usually around 10 stars per mosaic field ) . presumably , these stars correspond to those with large proper motions .",
    "the residuals of the final astrometric solutions were around 0.4 .",
    "lists of optical sources were generated using the sextractor software package @xcite .",
    "our magnitudes were derived using the gunn - oke @xcite metric aperture , which corresponds to a radius of 13.1 kpc using our adopted cosmology .",

    "finally , the images were visually inspected to confirm the star / galaxy segregations made by sextractor .",
    "the list of optical galaxies was then correlated with the list of radio sources .",

    "only one galaxy with unresolved radio emission had a radio - optical separation of more than 3 .",
    "overlays of radio contours on the optical images were also used to locate radio galaxies with extended emission , whose fitted gaussian positions need not necessarily correspond to optical positions .",
    "the resulting list contained 64 candidate radio galaxies brighter than @xmath37 and within 3 mpc of 17:12:45 + 64:03:54 , the adopted center coordinate of abell 2255 ( corresponding to the centroid of the cluster x - ray emission ; * ? ? ?",

    "several other extended radio sources with apparent optical hosts fainter than our cutoff magnitude were noted , although none of these have measured velocities and all are likely at higher redshift based on their optical magnitudes , colors , and radio morphologies and fluxes .",
    "the radio observations also detected numerous star forming galaxies in the cluster . in total , at least 26 galaxies exhibit emission lines indicative of current star formation .",
    "in several instances , these emission lines are very strong and narrow and indicate a starburst galaxy of type e(b ) in the morphs classification system . formally , we identify two of these type galaxies although we note that a third galaxy may also be of this type .",

    "galaxies with such spectra are manifestations of the e(a ) class in which dust extinction has entirely removed the [ oii ] emission , or reduced it below the noise level of the spectrum @xcite .    two further galaxies may be more extreme examples of star formation hidden by large dust extinction .",
    "j171207 + 640832 has a k+a spectrum and no emission line evidence for star formation , yet its radio luminosity ( @xmath55 w hz@xmath1 ) places it in the portion of the radio luminosity function which is dominated by star forming galaxies .",

    "the star forming galaxies ( figure [ fig - sfdist ] ) do not exhibit the same east - west alignment .",
    "in fact , they appear to be distributed preferentially along an axis running from the southeast to the northwest . this is more evident when one considers the spectral type of the star forming galaxies . in particular , the star forming galaxies with evidence for a current or recent _ burst _ of star formation ( the morphs classes e(a ) , e(b ) , and the k+a galaxy which is forming stars ) are all along this general axis .",
    "the location of the k+a galaxy without any optical emission lines is also along this axis .",
    "the visual interpretation of an alignment of the star forming galaxies was tested through the use of a fourier elongation test ( see * ? ? ?",
    "when all the star forming galaxies were included , there was no evidence for a prefered axis in the galaxy distribution",
    ". however , removal of the six star forming galaxies at radii larger than 2 mpc ( all of which are e(c ) galaxies ) produced a result significant at @xmath56 confidence . that is to say",
    ", the distribution of the star forming galaxies within 2 mpc of the cluster center is more elongated than 986 out of 1000 monte carlo simulations of the data .",
    "possible additional evidence for this prefered axis for the star forming galaxies may be seen in the optical morphology of one of the identified starburst galaxies .",
    "a grey - scale image of this galaxy ( j171320 + 640034 ) is shown in figure [ fig - ebgal ] .",
    "at least three `` streamers '' can be seen pointing away from the galaxy toward the se .",
    "the radio emission from the galaxy peaks along the central streamer .",
    "the absolute magnitude of this galaxy is @xmath57 , making it one of the fainter galaxies in the study .",
    "its radio luminosity is @xmath58 w hz@xmath1 .      in order to assess whether abell 2255 is truly unusual in terms of its radio galaxy population ,",
    "statistical tests were performed which compared the cluster to a composite sample of 19 other nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "the full 20 cluster sample consists of 18 clusters studied using nvss data , plus abell 2255 and abell 2256 .",
    "the radio observations for abell 2256 were performed concurrently with the abell 2255 program , and are discussed in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the statistical tests effectively evaluate differences in the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) of abell 2255 as compared to the rlf of the other clusters .",
    "the typical number of radio galaxies per cluster is around 20 , which often limits the significance at which conclusions may be drawn for a given cluster .",
    "however , this problem is largely avoided in the case of abell 2255 due to its large number of radio galaxies .",
    "first , we ask whether the shape of the rlf for abell 2255 differs from that of the other clusters .",
    "this was tested through application of a ks test , and requires no information other than the radio luminosities of the galaxies in all twenty clusters .",
    "a sample consisting of all clusters other than the cluster being studied is created , and the null hypothesis is that the radio luminosities of the cluster in question were drawn at random from the complete sample .",
    "this hypothesis could not be rejected with any reasonable level of confidence for any cluster in the sample , including abell 2255 .",
    "thus , despite the unusually high number of powerful radio galaxies in abell 2255 , there is no evidence that such sources are more numerous than would be expected given the rest of the radio population in the cluster .",
    "however , this does not examine the normalization of the rlf  the frequency with which galaxies in abell 2255 are radio sources relative to galaxies in other clusters .",
    "rephrased , is the fraction of radio galaxies to total cluster galaxies greater in abell 2255 than in other clusters ?",
    "this question is similar to that used in other studies of galaxy evolution , such as the butcher - oemler effect @xcite .",
    "a statistically significant larger fraction of radio galaxies would be an indication of increased activity within abell 2255 ( a higher normalization for the abell 2255 rlf ) , which may then be used to assess the potential environmental attributes of the cluster which give rise to such an effect .    to formally test the radio galaxy fractions",
    ", we used a chi - square statistic : @xmath59 here , the index @xmath60 implies that up to @xmath60 different groups could be compared to evaluate whether any given one differed from the others .",
    "for comparison of clusters individually against the collective sample created by the other clusters , @xmath61 .",
    "the index @xmath62 refers to whether a galaxy is detected or not detected in the radio , so @xmath63 represent the actual number of radio and non - radio galaxies and @xmath64 the number of expected radio and non - radio galaxies .",
    "the latter quantity is determined based on the number of galaxies in the cluster being tested ( @xmath65 ) and the radio galaxy fraction derived from the collective sample ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the resulting statistic is distributed as a chi - square with @xmath67 degrees of freedom .",
    "one potential weakness of this test is that it can be adversely affected by small number statistics ; small expected values ( @xmath68 ) produce artificially high significance .",
    "consequently , we have dismissed any results that included an @xmath69 .",
    "the number of cluster members for each cluster was estimated by counting all galaxies within 3 mpc as a function of magnitude .",
    "this total number was corrected for background counts by assuming that the surface density of background galaxies is represented by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 galaxies steradian@xmath1 .",
    "this value of @xmath72 was determined directly from the regions at the outskirts of the poorer clusters in the collective sample , and is consistent with that found in other studies ( e.g. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 galaxies steradian@xmath1 for * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) . finally , since the 18 nearer clusters of the sample all used the nvss as their source of radio data we have only included galaxies with radio luminosities above @xmath75 w hz@xmath1 , which amounts to a flux of 3.4 mjy at the farthest cluster for which nvss data were used ( note that this correponds to about 580 @xmath21jy in abell 2255 , significantly above our achieved flux limit ) .",
    "the galaxy counts are summarized in table [ tbl - rgnums ] .",
    "the tests were also performed separately for cluster galaxies within 3 mpc ( the limit of our surveys ) and 2 mpc ( about an abell radius ) .",
    "there was substantially more variation among the clusters when using the 3 mpc radius ( see table [ tbl - rgnums ] ) , as it accentuates the contribution due to the background correction . consequently , we will focus on the results obtained for galaxies within 2 mpc of the cluster centers .",
    "two clusters were found to have significantly different radio galaxy fractions than the rest of the sample : abell 1185 and abell 2255 , each at 99@xmath76 confidence . in each case",
    ", the cluster had a larger fraction of radio galaxies than would be expected .",
    "for abell 1185 , these were exclusively lower luminosity radio galaxies ( defined here as below @xmath77 w hz@xmath1 ) while for abell 2255 the more dramatic increase in radio galaxy fraction was for the higher radio luminosity galaxies .",
    "this result was expected based on the unusual number of extended radio galaxies noted in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "abell 2255 also had a possible excess of low luminosity radio galaxies , with a signficance level of just over 87@xmath76 .",
    "when examining just the lower luminosity radio galaxies , abell 2634 also appeared unusual in that it had a lower fraction of radio galaxies than would be expected ( about 98@xmath76 significance ) .",
    "what types of galaxies are producing these results ? to investigate this question , we examined the radio galaxy populations in light of their optical magnitudes .",
    "the same analysis was performed on subsets of the cluster galaxies corresponding to bright galaxies ( @xmath78 ) , intermediate galaxies ( @xmath79 ) , and faint galaxies ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "as noted before , this yielded a larger number of inconclusive results due to low expected numbers of radio galaxies , but still provided useful insight for many of the clusters .",
    "it was confirmed ( 97.5@xmath76 ) that the excess of high radio luminosity galaxies in abell 2255 were the optically brightest galaxies ( which is to be expected , since the probability for a galaxy to have a powerful radio source increases with optical luminosity up to @xmath81 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the excess in radio galaxy fraction in abell 1185 corresponded to intermediate optical magnitude galaxies ( 97.1@xmath76 ; similarly , abell 539 appears to also have more of these type galaxies than the other clusters , at over 99@xmath76 ) . dividing the sample into ranges in optical magnitude also revealed a second striking difference between abell 2255 and the other clusters : abell 2255 has a remarkable excess of optically - faint radio galaxies ( over 99.9@xmath76 significance ) . when performing the comparisons without the breakdown by optical magnitude ,",
    "this population was missed because abell 2255 s radio fraction of intermediate magnitude galaxies was consistent with the rest of the sample .",
    "the results for abell 2255 are depicted graphically in figure [ fig - a2255rlf ] .",
    "we have plotted radio galaxy fractions as a function of radio luminosity ( i.e. , a radio luminosity function ) for abell 2255 relative to the rest of the sample .",
    "the top left panel corresponds to all radio galaxies brighter than @xmath37 , where the increased radio galaxy fraction in abell 2255 is evident .",
    "the other three panels correspond to the results for the three subsets created by optical magnitude .",
    "it should be noted that the present discussion has not separated the radio galaxies into those powered by star formation and those powered by agn , as was done in section [ sec : over ] .",
    "this separation is not possible for the entire comparison sample , as we lack spectroscopy for about half of the galaxies . in general , the fainter galaxies are most often associated with star formation , the brighter galaxies with agn ( usually associated with elliptical host galaxies and lacking emission lines ) , and the intermediate galaxies representing a mixture of star forming galaxies and agn ( including emission line agn such as seyferts and liners ) . in the case of abell 2255 , there are 22 galaxies falling in the optically defined faint category ( i.e. , top right of figure [ fig - a2255rlf ] ) .",
    "the complete spectroscopy for the cluster enables us to note that 18 of these are star forming galaxies , with the remaining four including the two possible star forming galaxies with post - starburst spectra ( j171207 + 640832 and j171400 + 640542 ) and a pair of weak emission line agn . in the intermediate optical magnitude range",
    ", there are 16 galaxies evenly split between star forming and agn .",
    "the eight bright galaxies are exclusively agn , with all but one lacking emission lines .",
    "thus , the excess of radio sources among the optically - faint galaxies is almost exclusively attributed to star forming galaxies in abell 2255 .    since the radio galaxies are defined as cluster members only after they have been confirmed as such using spectroscopic measurements , the largest source of potential error in this calculation is the background correction .",
    "the effect of changing the assumed value of @xmath72 is minimal , as it is applied to all clusters of the sample .",
    "the much more critical parameter is cosmic variance , or the large variation in galaxy counts over different regions of sky . to determine whether abell 2255 only appears to have a high fraction of radio galaxies because it happens to lie in a region where the background is low , we investigated the radio galaxy fractions with different assumptions about the background correction . in these cases",
    ", we maintained @xmath71 galaxies steradian@xmath1 for the other 19 clusters but lowered it for abell 2255 .",
    "to reduce the significance of abell 2255 s high net radio galaxy fraction to below 95@xmath76 required that the background be @xmath82 lower .",
    "the result was even more striking for the optically faint galaxies .",
    "if _ all _ galaxies between @xmath83 and @xmath84 were cluster members ( hence no background correction , and the lowest possible radio galaxy fraction ) , abell 2255 would still exhibit an excess of radio galaxies in this magnitude interval at 97.5@xmath76 confidence .",
    "the data presented indicate that abell 2255 is an unusually active cluster of galaxies .",
    "it shows an excess of both powerful radio galaxies as well as optically faint star forming galaxies .",
    "the spectra of many of the star forming galaxies show evidence for current or recent bursts of star formation , strengthening the argument for increased activity in the cluster .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the star forming galaxies ( and particularly those with evidence for current or recent starbursts ) is elongated in a direction roughly perpendicular to the elongation of the x - ray emission and radio halo .    what is it about this cluster that is so conducive to these types of activity ?",
    "we searched for correlations between the radio galaxy fractions and two simple parameters of the clusters .",
    "there was no evidence for any correlation of radio galaxy fraction with cluster richness ( as parametrized by number of galaxies ) .",
    "also , no correlation was found between radio galaxy fraction and the `` compactness '' of the clusters , described as the number of galaxies within 0.5 mpc divided by the number of galaxies within 2 mpc .",
    "we are led to the notion that the dynamical state of abell 2255 is somehow responsible for its unusually large number of radio galaxies .",
    "@xcite found very different levels of activity for the clusters abell 2125 and abell 2645 .",
    "these clusters were chosen as they have the same richness and lie at the same redshift , yet abell 2125 has a large fraction of blue galaxies whereas abell 2645 does not .",
    "this difference was confirmed via deep radio observations and optical spectroscopy , and the authors noted that abell 2125 is a likely cluster - cluster merger whereas abell 2645 appears more virialized .",
    "consequently , they concluded that cluster - cluster mergers might have a dramatic effect on galaxies .",
    "given the large amount of evidence that abell 2255 is a cluster - cluster merger , we are led to the conclusion that such activity is probably responsible for the excess of radio galaxies in the cluster .",
    "x - ray , radio , and optical data point toward the merger axis for abell 2255 being aligned roughly east - west and close to the plane of the sky . this axis is easily seen in the x - ray emission of the cluster ( see figure [ fig - xray ] ) , and corresponds well with the cluster s radio halo @xcite .",
    "this is also revealed in optical images from the general alignment of the brighter galaxies at the center of the cluster .",
    "simulations of a head - on collision between two clusters presented in @xcite suggest that the merger axis is oriented @xmath85 from the line of sight to the cluster , and that the system is viewed only a short time after the cores of the two progenitor clusters have crossed ( @xmath86 gyr ) .",
    "how can such a merger explain the types of radio galaxies observed and their distributions ?",
    "the case for the powerful radio galaxies is fairly straightforward .",
    "galaxies of this type are among the more massive ellipticals in clusters , and are consequently located near the centers of clusters .",
    "they should therefore be distributed along the merger axis , which is the general impression one gets from figure [ fig - agndist ] .",
    "four of the fr i sources and the fr ii source may be found approximately along the east - west axis and within @xmath87 mpc of the cluster center .",
    "however , while combining two clusters would clearly increase the overall number of powerful radio galaxies , an increased radio galaxy fraction for such sources would result only if previously quiescent elliptical galaxies were triggered into becoming powerful radio sources .",
    "feretti et al .",
    "note this possibility in reference to j171329 + 640249 , which has a radio morphology consisting of two compact yet strong lobes of emission ( see figure [ fig - double ] ) .",
    "galaxies with this type of morphology are typically much larger , leading them to suggest its small size was consistent with its radio emission being triggered by the recent merger .",
    "additionally , mergers may prove necessary in the explanation of galaxies with head - tail morphologies .",
    "such mergers can produce large relative velocities between the host galaxy and the intracluster gas . in the model of @xcite , beams of radio - emitting material originate in the nucleus of the tailed radio galaxies .",
    "these beams are deflected by the host galaxy s ism into the wake which follows behind the galaxy as it moves through the intracluster gas .",
    "turbulence then serves to reaccelerate the particles in the wake and thereby power the radio emission in the tail .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that no new powerful radio galaxies have been created in the merger . as a region rich in substructure ( paper 1 ) ,",
    "abell 2255 may contain an excess of elliptical galaxies which were formerly associated with groups which have collected to form the cluster .",
    "cluster mergers may also initiate bursts of star formation in member gas - rich galaxies .",
    "@xcite noted that field galaxies falling into a cluster would experience ram pressure through interaction with the icm .",
    "@xcite argued that this could induce bursts of star formation as the molecular clouds of infalling galaxies get compressed .",
    "@xcite related this to mergers and the butcher - oemler effect , since merger activity would have been more common in the past .",
    "in addition , the butcher - oemler effect is an averaged trend meaning that not all intermediate redshift clusters have increased blue fractions .",
    "this spread in blue fraction fits in with a spread in dynamical state .    however , the role of the icm on the star formation of member galaxies is complicated by stripping .",
    "while denser molecular clouds may be compressed and lead to bursts of star formation , ram pressure appears to be highly effective at removing neutral gas from infalling galaxies .",
    "@xcite argued that ram pressure stripping could remove the entire gas supply of the galaxy in a very short time period ( @xmath88 years ) .",
    "this is particularly true for less massive galaxies , such as the fainter star forming galaxies seen in abell 2255 .",
    "once a cluster member galaxy has lost its gas reservoir , there is no reason to believe that it could resume a significant star forming episode .",
    "@xcite discussed the observational consequences of cluster - cluster mergers .",
    "their simulations presented an attractive theory which explains both the nature of abell 2255 s star forming galaxies and their distribution .",
    "as a subcluster falls into a larger cluster , it develops a bow shock which serves to protect the subcluster galaxies and icm .",
    "as the subcluster approaches the core of the primary cluster , this shock front slows and the subcluster galaxies pass through it .",
    "the large and rapid increase in ram pressure could initiate a burst of star formation , followed by truncation of the star formation due to gas stripping . while the subcluster galaxies are most affected by this process",
    ", it also applies to the galaxies in the primary cluster .",
    "the shock should also extend over mpc scales before dissipating , thereby affecting many cluster galaxies .",
    "based on observations of five nearby clusters with strong evidence for substructure , @xcite argued for a similar evolutionary mechanism .",
    "the circumstances in abell 2255 are nearly ideal should this be occurring . as it appears to be observed just after core passage , star forming galaxies in both the subcluster and primary cluster",
    "would have recently interacted with the shock front .",
    "the viewing geometry implies that star formation induced by such an effect would appear along a line centered on the core of the cluster and at right angles to the merger direction . indeed , this is what is observed ( see figure [ fig - sfdist ] ) .    as our straw model",
    ", we suggest that the peripheries of the progenitor clusters in the abell 2255 merger system included a number of field - type galaxies .",
    "these galaxies would have been bound to the clusters but in fairly circular orbits which kept them well outside the destructive influence of their parent cluster s intracluster gas .",
    "the merger would subject them to the environmental influences discussed above , often initiating bursts of star formation .",
    "the evidence for these episodes respresenting starbursts rather than more normal star formation is seen in their spectral classifications .",
    "at least two are strong starbursts , and at least six are of the spectral type associated with dusty starbursts @xcite .",
    "another galaxy has a k+a spectrum , indicating a burst of star formation has terminated in the galaxy within the past @xmath151 gyr .",
    "given the effectiveness of ram pressure stripping , once the initiated starburst has run its course the galaxies will fade .",
    "the brighter spirals might end up as s0 galaxies , but the majority of the observed star forming galaxies are likely to become dwarf spheroidals .    the rapidity with which these galaxies burst and fade",
    "suggests that the combination of timing and observational limits is critical to their identification .",
    "this helps to explain the different results for the other cluster - cluster mergers of the sample .",
    "abell 2256 is another excellent cluster - cluster merger candidate , but other than a potential excess of the most radio luminous galaxies it appears fairly normal .",
    "this cluster is believed to be an example of a pre - merger system @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is probably seen prior to the initiation of any bursts of star formation .",
    "the coma cluster ( abell 1656 ) is another potential merger candidate .",
    "in fact , several authors have commented on the similarities between coma and abell 2255 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , including that each cluster has a radio halo and a pair of dominant galaxies .",
    "the evidence for coma , however , suggests that it is being seen post - merger @xcite .",
    "any induced starbursts would have run their course , although the brighter ones might still be identified via post - starburst features .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite do note that the coma galaxies with post - starburst features are located primarily in the southwest of the cluster , consistent with a past merger in which the starbursts occurred near core passage .",
    "a further aspect of the straw model is that imposing an optical magnitude cutoff of @xmath5 means that any fainter galaxies which underwent bursts of star formation akin to those observed in abell 2255 would have faded out of view .",
    "in fact , the deep spectroscopy in abell 2255 actually detects star forming cluster galaxies _ fainter _ than @xmath37 ( see table [ tbl - morerg ] ) .",
    "these include j170902 + 641728 , a very compact faint galaxy ( @xmath89 ) and j170911 + 632940 , a strong e(b ) galaxy that lies just outside the 3 mpc limit ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "another potential cluster starburst is j171346 + 641647 , which has a velocity which formally places it outside of our cluster sample ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is also faint , but bright enough to have passed our magnitude cutoff ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the situation for coma may be similar ; the faint galaxy population is currently under study in a series of papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they do find that the fainter coma galaxies show more evidence for recent star formation .",
    "it is also intriguing to note that abell 1185 , with its increased fraction of radio galaxies with intermediate optical magnitudes , is a cluster with possible signs of a merger .",
    "@xcite presented a fairly large number of velocities for abell 1185 galaxies , and noted significant evidence for substructure found from these velocities .",
    "in addition , a comparison with the einstein x - ray data indicates that the centroid of the x - ray emission is offset from the optically - brightest galaxy by 3 .",
    "however , spectroscopy of these galaxies reveals that many are agn @xcite .",
    "another attractive feature of this explanation is its applicability to higher redshift clusters .",
    "should mergers be important to cluster galaxy evolution , we would expect clusters to show increased signs of activity at earlier epochs when clusters were being assembled ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it might also reconcile the results found by the morphs and cnoc collaborations for intermediate clusters .",
    "the morphs clusters were generally selected optically , while the cnoc clusters are x - ray selected .",
    "consequently , the morphs clusters are more likely to contain multiple bright galaxies ( and hence , frequently cluster - cluster mergers ) whereas the cnoc clusters are more likely to be virialized systems with bright central x - ray peaks .",
    "the populations of the two samples would thereby differ , with the morphs clusters showing large numbers of starburst and post - starburst systems and the cnoc clusters showing more quiescent histories for star forming galaxies .",
    "this explanation has been noted previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "of course , the application of a single evolutionary model to the cluster is an over - simplification .",
    "not all of the radio sources fit in with the above picture .",
    "there are several galaxies with spectra representative of fairly normal star formation located at various points along the periphery of the cluster .",
    "these are not aligned with the main distribution of star forming galaxies , nor do they show any evidence for unsual bursts of star formation activity .",
    "they do not therefore require any exotic explanation , as they could simply be normal star forming galaxies just entering the cluster .",
    "the powerful radio galaxies also suggest that the cluster s activity is not confined to the merger of only two partners .",
    "while four of the fr - type sources are located in the center of the system and aligned roughly along the merger axis , a fifth is a full 1.2 mpc to the east from the cluster center along this axis ( j171509 + 640254 ) .",
    "another lies @xmath93 mpc to the south ( j171316 + 634738 ) , while the most extreme example is just outside 3 mpc to the northeast ( j171530 + 643952 ) .",
    "it would seem likely that these radio sources were associated with groups other than the two primary merger partners .",
    "their presence is still difficult to explain given the lack of any obvious associated x - ray emission in their vicinities ( figure [ fig - xray ] , [ fig - agndist ] ) .",
    "abell 2255 is an unusually active cluster of galaxies . through our 1.4 ghz radio observations , which represent the most sensitive wide - field investigation of the cluster ever undertaken ,",
    "we have identified 46 cluster radio galaxies . included among these",
    "are six sources with fr i or fr ii radio morphologies , which represents a marked excess of such sources over typical clusters .",
    "a more striking excess is observed in the faint star forming population .",
    "this result is robust , being insensitive to the assumed background correction and cosmic variance .",
    "thus , galaxies in abell 2255 are more likely to be radio sources than comparable galaxies in other clusters .",
    "the reason for this enhancement appears to be a fortuitous combination of factors related to the merger stage , geometry , and our observational limits .",
    "abell 2255 is an excellent example of a dynamically - active cluster , viewed nearly at a right angle to a merger axis and shortly after the cores of the progenitor clusters have crossed .",
    "models suggest that this situation implies that a large number of galaxies have recently crossed the shock front that formed between the progenitors , thereby causing a large spike in pressure on their interstellar matter and promoting a burst of star formation .",
    "the viewing geometry insures that these galaxies appear distributed roughly along a line perpendicular to the merger axis , an effect which is seen in the data .",
    "furthermore , the spectra of the galaxies often indicate a burst of star formation rather than simple truncation .",
    "interaction with the icm will presumably remove the reservoirs of neutral gas that these galaxies possess , so once they have exhausted their molecular gas in their current star formation episodes they will fade into a quiescent population . hence , should the same cluster be viewed roughly one gyr hence it would likely appear fairly normal in regards to its radio population .",
    "this model clearly requires additional testing .",
    "in addition to further numerical simulations , it needs to be evaluated using a larger sample of cluster - cluster mergers .",
    "these necessarily include merger systems viewed at a range of stages ( from pre - core passage through post - core passage ) and viewing geometries , plus deeper observational limits to better probe the faint galaxy population which appears critical to our understanding .",
    "this latter point is particularly true at higher redshift , where merger activity is likely more common but absolute observational limits are higher .",
    "of course , the evaluation of factors such as merger stage and viewing geometry is difficult and undoubtedly requires both increased data ( x - ray , galaxy kinematics , etc . ) and numerical modeling of mergers .",

    "<S> deep vla 1.4 ghz radio continuum imaging of abell 2255 is presented . </S>",
    "<S> this cluster is among the better nearby candidates for rich cluster - cluster merger systems , with evidence including an elongated x - ray morphology , the presence of a radio halo , and substructure present in its galaxy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our radio observations reach an rms sensitivity of @xmath0jy beam@xmath1 , enabling us to detect ( at 5@xmath2 ) star formation rates as low as 1.4 m@xmath3 year@xmath1 from the center of the cluster out to a radial distance of 3@xmath4 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the radio data are complemented by optical imaging and a large spectroscopic database , allowing us to separate all galaxies with @xmath5 into cluster members and foreground / background galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are also used to associate the galaxies radio emission with either star formation or agn .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare the resulting cluster radio galaxy population with those of nineteen other nearby abell clusters , and find strong evidence for an increase in the frequency of radio galaxies in abell 2255 . </S>",
    "<S> this increase is seen in two separate types of galaxies : powerful radio agn and optically - faint star forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectra of the latter often indicate current or recent starbursts , and these galaxies appear to be distributed along an axis perpendicular to the probable merger axis . </S>",
    "<S> we assess these factors in light of models of galaxy evolution , and suggest that the cluster - cluster merger is responsible for triggering galaxy activity in abell 2255 . </S>"
