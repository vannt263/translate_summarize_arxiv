    "the self - assembly of colloidal particles into structures with controlled spatial ordering is of great importance in colloid science , with particular interest in the assembly of photonic crystals @xcite  artificially produced periodic dielectric structures designed to control and manipulate light . in this context , a variety of colloidal structures assembled in liquid crystal ( lc ) matrices @xcite , combined with the unique mechanical and electro - optical properties of the lc host @xcite , have proven to be good candidates for the development of colloid crystals with tunable photonic properties .    in conventional colloids , in isotropic fluids ,",
    "the colloidal particles interact via van der waals , electrostatic , or steric forces .",
    "these forces are isotropic , and their range does not exceed a few tens of nanometers .",
    "by contrast , when dispersed in a lc , due to its long - range orientational molecular ordering , colloidal particles interact predominantly through long - range anisotropic forces @xcite .",
    "the origin of these effective forces is the elastic distortions of the lc matrix due to the presence of the colloidal particles .",
    "the range of the elastic forces is of the order of several colloidal diameters .",
    "elastic forces drive the particles to self - assemble into linear chains @xcite , periodic lattices @xcite , anisotropic clusters @xcite , and cellular structures @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of lc colloids is the presence of topological defects @xcite , that not only determine the symmetry of the long - range colloidal interaction @xcite , but also stabilize the ordered aggregates at short range @xcite , where the elastic interactions are dominated by non - linear effects and render the self - assembly of lc colloids a challenging theoretical problem .",
    "topological defects in nematic liquid crystals ( nlc ) are nucleated due to the mismatch of the global and local ( at the colloidal surfaces ) boundary conditions leading to frustration of the uniform nematic order .    small spherical particles ( @xmath0 m ) imposing homeotropic surface anchoring on the nematic director stabilize equatorial saturn - ring defects @xcite , which for larger particles may be stabilized through confinement @xcite , or by external electric fields @xcite .",
    "the far - field distortions have quadrupolar symmetry and the resulting pairwise colloidal interaction is of the quadrupolar type decaying with the distance @xmath1 between the particles as @xmath2 @xcite .    larger particles ( @xmath3 m ) ) with homeotropic anchoring induce point - like hedgehog defects @xcite , which lead to a far - field director of dipolar symmetry and a large distance colloidal interaction varying as @xmath4 @xcite . for particles with planar degenerate anchoring , two antipodal surface defects , known as boojums @xcite are nucleated which lead to a far - field director of quadrupolar symmetry .",
    "recent numerical calculations reveal that the cores of nematic boojums can take three different configurations @xcite : single core , double core , or split core .",
    "the single - core boojum is a point - like index @xmath5 defect with azimuthal symmetry , the split - core boojum has two index @xmath6 surface point - like defects connected by a @xmath6 bulk disclination line .",
    "the double - core boojum is an intermediated structure with broken azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the far - field distortions and the resulting asymptotic pair interaction between particles with degenerate planar anchoring are of the quadrupolar type @xcite , as for saturn - ring particles .",
    "recently , a light sensitive coating of colloidal particles was used in order to switch the surface anchoring from homeotropic to planar , reversibly @xcite , providing the means for tuning the colloidal interactions and thus controlling the assembly of the colloidal structures .",
    "direct assembly of two - dimensional @xmath7 crystallites of quadrupolar @xcite , dipolar @xcite , or dipolar and quadrupolar @xcite , spherical particles has been achieved by using laser tweezer techniques .",
    "the crystallites are stabilized by the presence of topological defects , which provide local free energy minima of the order of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath10 the absolute temperature . by contrast , interacting quadrupolar boojum - particles in three - dimensional systems do not exhibit short - range repulsive behaviour , and the equilibrium configuration corresponds to close contact or coalescence of the particles @xcite .    .",

    "the particles with radius @xmath13 m were confined to a cell of thickness @xmath14 m in order to stabilize the saturn - ring configuration around the particles with homeotropic anchoring .",
    "both types of particles generate quadrupolar nematic distortions , but the corresponding quadrupolar moments have different signs , meaning that the particles attract each other when they are aligned parallel or perpendicular to the far - field director .",

    "this is in sharp contrast to the p - p interaction force @xcite , where @xmath116 is always two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath117 .",

    "for both values of @xmath11 we find @xmath135 , which is in good agreement with the asymptotic power law @xmath136 . from these fits",
    "we also obtain @xmath137 and @xmath138 for @xmath103 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the experimental value @xmath139 reported in ref .",
    "recently , a directed assembly of spherical particles dispersed in a nematic host into @xmath12 square crystal - like structures was reported @xcite .",
    "this has been achieved by mixing quadrupolar colloidal particles with distinct anchoring conditions , namely homeotropic and degenerate planar .",
    "the homeotropic anchoring particles nucleate saturn - ring defects , and the planar anchoring particles antipodal boojums . in the linear regime",
    "each of these colloidal particles induce long - range distortions of the nematic director with quadrupolar symmetry @xcite , and as a consequence the long - range pair interaction is of the quadrupolar type . in this paper",
    "we have studied numerically the nematic - mediated interaction between two such particles . for simplicity",
    "we have assumed spherical particles of equal radii .",
    "we have confirmed that the s and p particles have quadrupole moments with opposite signs , @xmath99 .",
    "the asymptotic analysis @xcite suggests that s particles have a positive quadrupole moment , and p particles a negative one . at large distances",
    "the interaction potential @xmath91 behaves as @xmath140 with @xmath135 which is in excellent agreement with the asymptotic result @xmath2 for quadrupolar interactions .",
    "we have also confirmed numerically the experimental values for the product of the quadrupole moments @xmath124 .",
    "note that if the confining surfaces of the experimental setup @xcite had an influence on the pair interaction , there would be a deviation from the power law behaviour that would eventually ( for very strong confinement ) turn into an exponential decay .",
    "since in our calculations the finite size effects are negligible , our results indicate that in the experiment of ognysta et al .",
    "@xcite the confining surfaces played a negligible role . for distances @xmath141 , the asymptotic quadrupolar result eq .",
    "is qualitatively wrong , see fig .",

    "[ energy ] red squares ) .    under some conditions , the p particles nucleate boojums of complex biaxial structure @xcite .",
    "this leads to a biaxial quadrupolar distortion , since it breaks the axial symmetry , and could change the asymptotic uniaxial expression given by eq .",
    "however , since the size of the biaxial regions is of the order of the nematic correlation length , the biaxial perturbation at large distances are negligible , which explains the good agreement between our numerical results and the asymptotic expression for uniaxial quadrupoles .",
    "by contrast to the interaction of particles with identical anchoring conditions ( p - p , or s - s ) , the s - p interaction potential @xmath91 exhibits two minima ( in the first quadrant ) , when the particles are oriented at @xmath103 or @xmath109 relative to the far - field director , and separated by @xmath142 and @xmath143 , see fig .",
    "[ energy ] .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with those reported experimentally @xcite , @xmath105 and @xmath144 @xcite .",

    "these two features of the pair interaction potential are pre - requisites for the assembly of colloidal lattices with rectangular unit cells .",
    "we have calculated the pair elastic force , see fig .",
    "[ force ] .",
    "the polar component @xmath116 is always zero at @xmath145 , and acquires rather large values at oblique orientations @xmath11 , provided that the inter - particle distance is not too large ( @xmath146 , see fig .",

    "[ cusp ] . therefore , there is a strong elastic force which aligns a pair of colloidal particles either parallel ( @xmath148 ) , or perpendicular ( @xmath150 ) to the far - field director .",
    "once the particles are aligned along one of these directions , they move under the action of the radial force @xmath117 towards the global @xmath151 , or the local @xmath152 equilibrium positions .",
    "the presence of a strong aligning force @xmath116 at small - to - intermediate distances is in sharp contrast with the p - p interaction profile @xcite , where the polar component @xmath116 is always two orders of magnitudes smaller than the radial force @xmath117 .",
    "most theoretical studies of the interaction between colloidal particles in nematic liquid crystals focus on particles with the same size .",
    "although this may seem a rather strong simplification , it is justified by the current experimental ability of producing monodispersed colloidal particles .",
