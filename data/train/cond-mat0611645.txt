    "future experiments on ultracold gases will require theoretical input from numerical simulations which are reliable in the case of strong interactions beyond the realm of perturbative expansions .",
    "powerful non - perturbative techniques have been developed ranging from the partial summation of feynman diagrams in the context of condensed matter and nuclear theory ( e.g.  the many - body t - matrix approach @xcite ) to more recent renormalization group ideas inspired from quantum information theory ( e.g.  the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite ) .",
    "these methods , however , are often intractable in systems at finite temperatures or beyond one spatial dimension .",
    "many of the complications at finite temperatures arise from a need to account for higher - order classical fluctuations , for instance , near a second - order phase transition . here , a rather broad category of methods , which we will refer to as `` classical field '' ( cf ) methods , have proved to be a useful alternative .",
    "initially conceived of as a convenient way to sample the thermodynamic partition function , similar to monte - carlo techniques @xcite , a variant of these cf methods , known as the `` classical field method , '' has recently been developed and employed to study both the thermodynamics and real - time dynamics of cold atomic systems .",
    "some recent examples are studies of vortex - antivortex binding in the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite or the shift of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) transition temperature in an interacting bose gas @xcite . despite its relative success , a rigorous , formal understanding of the level of fluctuations included by the `` classical field method , '' and its relation to more traditional cf methods , is still lacking .    in this paper",
    ", we establish that , in the case of an interacting bose gas in a one - dimensional ring geometry , the `` classical field method '' approaches the same equilibrium as the more traditional stochastic and molecular dynamics cf methods , and that this equilibrium agrees with an exact evaluation of the partition function in the high - temperature limit .",
    "first , we discuss the stochastic dynamics approach which , in the flavor of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation , relaxes the field configuration to the minimum of the free energy while accounting for thermal fluctuations about this minimum .",
    "second , we evaluate the microcanonical dynamics method which resembles a molecular dynamics approach based on hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "third , we look at the `` classical field method '' which is based on the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .    in the case of the one - dimensional bose gas on a ring , that we consider here ,",
    "there is a simple way to evalutate the partition function at finite temperatures known as the transfer integral method .",
    "this solution serves us as a reference to which we can compare the properties of the steady states which the simulations reach .",
    "we find that the thermodynamic properties , such as distribution and correlation functions , of all three simulations , agree very well with the exact solution given by the transfer integral .",
    "we begin by evaluating the high - temperature limit of the partition function for an interacting bose gas on a one - dimensional ring , exactly , by means of the transfer integral method @xcite .",

    "the distribution function @xmath48 still agrees well with the exact solution ( [ distribution ] ) . while the simulation equilibrates to the correct density @xmath49 , its spatial correlation function @xmath50 deviates for large spatial scales from the transfer integral as given in eq .",
