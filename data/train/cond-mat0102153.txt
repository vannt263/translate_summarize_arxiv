    "understanding of electronic transport in solids subjected to high magnetic fields was revised profoundly after the discovery of the quantum hall effect ( klitzing 1980 ) for two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "this phenomenon manifests an extraordinary transport behavior as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "the hall resistivity , @xmath3 , is quantized to @xmath4 with @xmath5 being either an integer or rational fraction , while the resistivity , @xmath6 , vanishes .    the main goal of this paper is to present a thermodynamic approach to the iqhe problem .",
    "we address the problem of zero - temperature transport , where all known scattering events are due to impurities and long - range potential .",
    "both cases were considered by baskin ( 1978 ) and fogler ( 1997 ) classically , when 2deg conductivity was found to follow drude formalism and vanished at a magnetic field exceeding a certain value , dependent on the dominant scattering . moreover , the exact solution for 2deg in a strong magnetic field in the presence of impurities was found by baskin ( 1978 ) . for an impurity concentration per unit area , @xmath7 , 2deg conductivity vanishes when @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a zero - width landau level(ll ) density of states(dos ) , and @xmath10 the magnetic length . following the above scenario ,",
    "we further investigate the extreme quantum limit , when 2deg is considered @xmath0 , and both the conductivity and resistivity tensors are off - diagonal .",
    "the thermodynamics of reversible processes are known to be valid ( obraztsov 1964 ) in such a case .",
    "our support of this idea is confirmed by thermopower measurements data ( obloh 1984 ) , found to agree with theoretical predictions for dissipationless 2deg .",
    "the crucial point of this paper is that an extraneous resistivity can , nevertheless , arise from combined peltier and seebeck thermoelectric effects ( kirby and laubitz 1973 , cheremisin 2001 ) .",
    "the current leads to heating(cooling ) at the first(second ) sample contacts , owing to the peltier effect .",
    "the contact temperatures are different , and the temperature gradient is linear in current .",
    "the voltage drop is equal to the thermoemf induced by the peltier effect . as a result ,",
    "the resistivity associated with the above voltage is nonzero .",
    "we argue that this value may be identified as the 2deg resistivity proper .",
    "we compared our results with experimental data .",
    "in fact , the possible undesirable influence of thermoemf on qhe measurements was discussed among experimentalists ( shahar , 2002 ) .",
    "according to conventional thermodynamics , the chemical potential , @xmath11 , for system conductors+2deg ( see figure [ f.1 ] , inset ) is constant at equilibrium . moreover , @xmath12 remains constant under minor current induced fluctuations from the equilibrium .",
    "we conclude that 2deg is non - isolated .",
    "we argue that an external reservoir of electrons , if it exists , could provide the pinning of the 2deg chemical potential .",
    "baraff and tsui(1980 ) and konstantinov ( 1983 ) suggested that the remote ionized donors(surface states in si - mos ) may serve as such a reservoir . if we suppose that @xmath12 is fixed , it can be shown that the 2deg density , @xmath13 , changes with the magnetic field .",
    "indeed , at @xmath14 , @xmath15 electrons are required in order to occupy @xmath5 levels .",
    "hence , the hall conductivity is given by @xmath16 the reservoir must furnish the opportunity for the variation of @xmath13 over sufficiently wide limits in order to achieve observable @xmath17-plateaux .",
    "unfortunately , this scenario ceased ( klitzing 1984 ) , because of insufficient strength of the reservoir in both models .",
    "in contrast , the experiments ( nizhankovskii 1986 ) support the reservoir conception and point to an oscillatory dependence of electron density on magnetic field . we claim that the 3d electrons of the metal leads can play a role in such a reservoir . indeed , in a strong magnetic field , when only a few lls are filled , the absolute change in @xmath13 at a fixed @xmath11 is of the order of density , @xmath18 , of strongly degenerated 2deg at @xmath19",
    ". hence , the number of 3d reservoir electrons changes . the relative variation of the chemical potential of 3d electrons is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the length and width of 2deg , and @xmath22 is the total number of 3d electrons . for a typical sample ( 1@xmath233 mm@xmath24 , @xmath25@xmath26 ) we have @xmath27 .",
    "evidence shows that 2d chemical potential is fixed under such conditions , providing the expected quantization accuracy .",
    "let us consider a 2deg in the x - y plane(figure [ f.1 ] , inset ) , subjected to a magnetic field @xmath28 .",
    "the 2deg structure is arbitrary , the electrons are supposed to occupy the first size - quantization sub - band . for simplicity ,",
    "we disregard spin effects , the 2d electron energy spectrum being @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the ll number , and @xmath31 the cyclotron frequency .",
    "then , we assume no further ll broadening within the extreme quantum limit @xmath32 .",
    "a hall - bar geometry sample is connected to the current source by means of two identical leads .",
    "the contacts are assumed to be ohmic .",
    "the voltage is measured between the open ends ( `` e '' and `` d '' ) , kept at the temperature of the external thermal reservoir .",
    "the sample is placed in a chamber with a mean temperature @xmath33 .",
    "including the temperature gradient term , the macroscopic current , @xmath34 , and the energy flux , @xmath35 , densities are given by @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the electric field , @xmath38 the electrochemical potential , and @xmath39 the thermopower .",
    "the conductivity , @xmath40 , and resistivity , @xmath41 , tensors are assumed to be off - diagonal , therefore @xmath42 . then , @xmath43  is the electron - related thermal conductivity , and @xmath44 the lorentz number .",
    "note that ( [ e.1 ] ) is valid for a confined - topology sample , for which the diamagnetic surface currents ( obraztsov 1964 ) are accounted .",
    "both einstein and onsager relationships are satisfied . in fact , ( [ e.1 ] ) represents the current and energy dissipationless fluxes caused by electron drift in crossed fields ( for 3d case , see zyryanov 1964 ) . using ( [ e.1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath45 the current represents the flux of electrons in crossed fields with a drift velocity @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the hall electric field . the transverse electron flow caused by the longitudinal electric field @xmath48",
    "is compensated by that associated with the downstream temperature gradient .",

    "the enlarged plot of data depicted in section a is represented in figure [ f.2 ] .",
    "insets : ( left ) low - field dependence of resistivities given by ( [ e.3],[e.4]);(right)qhe experimental setup ]    we can now determine the temperature gradient caused by the peltier effect .",
    "recall that peltier heat is generated by a current crossing the contact between two different conductors . at that contact ( for example `` a '' in figure [ f.1 ] , inset ) , the temperature , @xmath52 , electrochemical potential @xmath53 , normal components of the total current ,",
    "@xmath54 , and the total energy flux are continuous .",
    "there exists a difference @xmath55 between the thermopowers of the metal and 2deg , respectively . at @xmath56 , the charge crossing the contact `` a ''",
    "gains an energy @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , @xmath58 is the amount of peltier heat evolved per unit time in the contact `` a '' . for @xmath56 and current flow direction shown in figure [ f.1 ] ,",
    "the contact `` a '' is heated and the contact `` b '' is cooled .",
    "the contacts are at different temperatures , and @xmath59 . at small currents ,",
    "the temperature gradient is small and @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", @xmath39 can be assumed to be constant , and , hence , we disregard thomson heating ( @xmath61 ) of 2deg . as will be shown , the sample cooling caused by heat leak via the leads and 3d substrate is negligible .",
    "hence , we consider a 2deg under adiabatic cooling conditions , when the amount of the peltier heat evolved at the contact `` a '' is equal to that absorbed at the contact `` b '' .    the energy flux is continuous at each contact , thus @xmath62 . here , we take into account that the current is known to enter and leave the sample at two diagonally opposite corners(figure [ f.1 ] , inset ) . the temperature gradient is given by @xmath63 , thus being linear in current .",
    "the voltage drop , @xmath64 , measured between the ends  e  and  d  is found to be @xmath65 . ignoring conductor resistances , both the hall and peltier - effect - induced resistivities yield @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the 2d density , @xmath69 $ ] the thermodynamic potential , and @xmath70 the fermi function .",
    "we take into account in ( [ e.3 ] ) that for actual case of metal leads @xmath71 .",
    "note that the dissipated power is positive , since @xmath72 .",
    "( [ e.3 ] ) can also then be applied to four - probe hall - bar measurements and to the 2dhg case .",

    "it can be demonstrated that @xmath79 are universal functions of the reduced temperature @xmath80 and the magnetic field @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the filling factor .",

    "the corbino topology measurements ( dolgopolov 1991 ) demonstrate that @xmath147 . in practice ,",
    "both the transverse and the longitudinal conductivities are always derived from the hall - bar sample resistivity data .",

    "this dependence(figure [ f.3 ] ) is similar to that known as the  semicircle  relation .",
    "the known electron - phonon coupling is weak below @xmath154 1k .",
    "hence , the heat transfer from 2deg to the mixing chamber could occur through the contacts and the leads connected to them .",
    "however , the experiments ( mittal 1994 ) at @xmath19 demonstrate that the 2deg alone is the dominant thermal resistance .",
    "the 2deg cooling is provided by electron thermal conductivity found to follow widemann - franz law .",
    "accordingly , our adiabatic cooling approach is applicable . at the same time",
    ", remote black body radiation heating is known to play an important role as @xmath155 .",
    "for example , the electron temperature can differ ( mittal 1994 ) from that of the mixing chamber refrigerator(30mk ) by as much as 100mk .",
    "the extraneous power heating of electrons is caused by black body radiation ( @xmath156pw ) from the walls of the vacuum can surrounding the refrigerator .",
    "hence , in ultra low - t experiments , 2deg is overheated : the electron temperature is higher than that of the bath , i.e. @xmath157 . neglecting for a moment 2deg overheating , we have estimated an established temperature gradient . at @xmath158 , we have @xmath159 , @xmath160 . for a @xmath161mm@xmath162 sample and a current @xmath163na , we obtain @xmath164mk / mm . at liquid - helium temperatures , @xmath165 , confirming our approach as valid .",
    "however , at @xmath166 our basic assumption of a small temperature gradient is violated since @xmath167 .",
    "it is to be noted that at elevated currents , the local temperature @xmath168 is established in the sample , dependent on the ratio @xmath169 , and differing from @xmath33 .",
    "the thinner the sample and/or the higher the current , the greater the difference from @xmath33 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath101-peaks width depends on the local temperature .",
    "this mechanism appears to play a crucial role in current - polarity dependent qhe breakdown ( komiyama 1996 ) .",
    "we can now improve our model , assuming a ll broadening .",
    "dos can be represented as the sum of gaussian peaks @xmath170 $ ] with ll width , @xmath171 , independent of the magnetic field .",
    "obviously , our previous results remain valid when @xmath172@xmath171 . in the opposite case of low - temperature @xmath173 ,",
    "the ll broadening becomes important and determines a @xmath49-plateau width , @xmath50-peak width and height .",
    "indeed , at @xmath173 , dos can be considered as constant in the vicinity of the n - th ll . a small deviation of @xmath174 , in the n - th ll , with respect to chemical potential , results in a @xmath175 change in the number of occupied states .",
    "for @xmath49-scaling , the logarithmic slope is @xmath176 , i.e. it is proportional to ll width ( see figure [ f.3 ] , inset ) .",
    "then , at @xmath173 the entropy yields @xmath177 , and therefore the @xmath50-peaks height decreases at @xmath14 . in contrast , @xmath50-scaling data obeys the @xmath178-scenario , the logarithmic slope being @xmath179 .",
    "finally , at @xmath180 the height of the @xmath50 peaks decreases , but their width remains finite .",
    "we must emphasize that the effects related to nonzero ll can be masked because of 2deg overheating . indeed , upon bath cooling , the electron temperature would be constant , being controlled by remote black body heat sources . in the case of strong heating ,",
    "the electron temperature is decoupled with respect to bath(@xmath157 ) , and the condition @xmath173 can not be achieved . as a result ,",
    "the logarithmic slope @xmath181 is at first linear , and then saturates below a certain value of heat - dependent temperature .",
    "such a saturation behavior is similar to that discussed above within the nonzero - width ll scenario .",
    "it should be noted that , in both cases , one can attribute ( see figure [ f.3 ] , inset ) the dependence @xmath181 to the power law @xmath182 , where @xmath183 . in actual fact , the question as to whether the power law or linear scaling scenario is valid is still the subject of heated debate(huckestein 1995 , sondhi 1997 ) .",
    "recent experiments ( shahar 1998 , coleridge 1999 , balaban 1998 ) demonstrate that the linear dependence is preferable , while power law application to restricted portions of data is always possible . neglecting ll broadening and 2deg overheating , for ingaas / inp 2d electron gas ( shahar 1998 ) at @xmath184@xmath26 and @xmath185(spin",
    "is accounted ) , we obtain @xmath186(k ) for @xmath50-scaling .",
    "this result is consistent with the fit @xmath187 , where @xmath188k@xmath189 , @xmath190 , as found by shahar ( 1998 ) .",
    "we attribute the non - zero logarithmic slope at @xmath155 to an extraneous heating of 2deg .",
    "indeed , @xmath191-data exhibit ( shahar 1998 ) a well - pronounced `` qh - transition '' , indicating the unimportance of ll broadening .",
    "finally , we address the question of 2deg self - heating due to finite energy dissipation @xmath192 . by equating the unit area power @xmath193dissipated in the sample ( koch 1991 ) to that absorbed by phonons ( chow 1996 ) @xmath194",
    ", we can determine the electron temperature which can be comparable with the bath temperature @xmath195 and @xmath196 . if @xmath157 , we obtain the power - law fit for a @xmath50-peak width , as @xmath197 , known for current and sample - width scaling .",
    "for @xmath198 ( see koch 1991 ) , we have @xmath199 , consistent with experimental finding @xmath200 .",
    "we argue that simultaneous measurement ( balaban 1998 ) of temperature and frequency - dependent linear scaling @xmath201 points to 2deg heating by incoming(@xmath156 nw ) ac power .    up to now only the dc case has been discussed .",
    "however , our approach can also be applied to the ac case . as shown by kirby and laubitz(1973 ) and cheremisin(2001 ) , at @xmath19 the peltier effect related resistivity vanishes above a certain frequency , dependent on thermal inertial processes .",
    "we recall that , in a quantizing magnetic field , macroscopic current and heat fluxes are known to depend on the magnetism of the conducting electrons(obraztsov 1964 ) . actually , eqs.([e.1 ] ) describe the average current and heat densities for a confined topology sample .",
    "we argue that the diamagnetic currents could define the dynamics of thermal processes in 2deg . for @xmath202 t ,",
    "@xmath203  we have @xmath204hz , @xmath205a . for a sample size @xmath206  mm ,",
    "the transit time of an electron scattered at the sample boundary is @xmath207 .",
    "accordingly , we can estimate the critical frequency to be @xmath208ghz . the smaller the sample , the higher @xmath209 . at the moment , however , a detailed spectral analysis of @xmath50 is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in conclusion , the magnetotransport measurements of 2d electron(hole ) gas , assumed to be dissipationless in the qh regime , result in a resistivity associated with the peltier and seebeck effects combined .",
    "this value is probably associated with 2d resistivity proper .",
