    "although the spin moment of mn atoms is larger than the moment of co atoms ( table  [ table1 ] ) the opposite relation between exchange parameters can be the consequence of the smaller distance between the co atoms : @xmath54 between the co atoms and @xmath55 between the mn atoms .",

    "the curie temperature is given by the average value of the magnon energies .",
    "in mfa this is the arithmetic average while in rpa this is harmonic average .",
    "therefore we need to understand why for co@xmath0cral these two averages are much closer than for nimnsb .",
    "the following properties of the averages are important for us .",
    "the arithmetic average takes all the magnon values with equal weight whereas in the harmonic average the weight decreases with increasing energy of the magnon.@xcite it is an arithmetic property that the mfa estimation is larger than the rpa one or equal to it if all numbers to be averaged are equal to each other . in terms of magnon energies",
    ", @xmath57 is equal to @xmath58 in the case that the magnon spectrum is dispersion - less .",
    "considering the frozen - magnon dispersions from the viewpoint of these properties we indeed can expect that the arithmetic and harmonic averages will be closer for co@xmath0cral . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] both curves are scaled to have almost the same maximal value .",
    "it is seen that the co@xmath0cral dispersion has smaller relative contribution of the low - energy magnons because of the steeper increase of the curve at small wave vectors .",
    "it has also smaller contribution of the magnons with the largest energies because the maxima have the form of well - defined peaks opposite to nimnsb where we get a plateau .",
    "thus the main contribution in the case of co@xmath0cral comes from intermediate energies that makes the mfa and rpa estimations closer .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present the calculated spin - wave spectra for nimnsb and co@xmath0cral .",
    "the spin - wave energies are obtained by the diagonalization of the matrix of exchange parameters that contains all important intra- and inter - sublattice interactions .",
    "the number of branches in the spectrum is equal to the number of magnetic atoms in the unit cell : two in nimnsb and three in co@xmath0cral .",
    "one of the branches is acoustic and has zero energy for zero wave vector .",
    "also in the spin - wave spectra , we see strong difference between two systems . in nimnsb ,",
    "the acoustic branch is predominantly of the ni type stemming from the weak interaction between mn and ni magnetic moments ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical branch is of predominantly the mn type .",
    "the strong hybridization between two sublattices is obtained only about @xmath59 . in co@xmath0cral ,",
    "the energy scale of the branches differs much smaller and the hybridization between sublattices is stronger than for nimnsb .",
    "coming back to the considerations of the curie temperatures , we conclude that , in general , the curie temperatures of co@xmath0mnsi and co@xmath0cral calculated within both mfa and rpa are in good agreement with experiment while the mfa values in the case of nimnsb and comnsb overestimate the curie temperature strongly .",
    "the lattice contraction leads in both compounds to an enhancement of the mn - co(cr - co ) exchange constants that results in an increase of the curie temperature .",
    "kurtulus and collaborators have calculated the curie temperature for co@xmath0mnsi within mfa and found the value of 1251 k that is considerably larger than our mfa estimate of 857 k. this difference is unexpected since the values of the exchange parameters obtained by kurtulus _",
    "_ agree well with our parameters ( fig.[fig4 ] ) . to reveal the origin of the discrepancy we performed the mfa calculation of the curie temperature with the exchange parameters of kurtulus _ et al .",
    "_ and obtained the @xmath7 value of 942 k which is in reasonable agreement with our estimate .",
    "apparently the reason for the inconsistency is in the procedure of the solving of the multiple - sublattice mfa problem used by kurtulus _",
    "_ that should deviate from the standard one .",
    "the study of the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties of itinerant ferromagnets is one of the fundamental problems of ongoing researches . although density functional theory can formally be extended to the finite temperatures @xcite , it is rarely used because of the lack of suitable exchange - correlation potentials for magnetic systems at finite temperatures .",

    "the nature of the spin ( quantum or classical ) influences the form of the curves considerably .",

    "[ fig7](b ) we present the temperature dependence of the magnetization of individual sublattices .",
    "as expected from the previous discussions in half - heusler systems the main contribution to the magnetization comes from the mn sublattice while for the full - heusler systems both 3__d _ _ atoms contribute substantially .    considering the calculated curie temperatures we notice that the value of @xmath7 calculated within the quantum - mechanical rpa is substantially larger than the corresponding classical estimation ( see fig .",

    "we can suggest the following arguments .",
    "the quantum treatment is more appropriate than the classical one in the low - temperature region . at high temperatures characterized by strong deviation of the atomic spins from the magnetization axis the quantum treatment gives too slow decrease of the magnetization .",
    "it is worth noting that the consequent theory should take into account not only the orientational disorder of the atomic moments but also the single - particle ( stoner - type ) excitations leading to the decrease of atomic moments .",
    "another important aspect is related to the fact that the exchange parameters used in the calculations are estimated within the picture of classical atomic moments described above .",
