    "scuti stars , the excited pulsation modes are of low order ( @xmath58 up to 7 ) , so that the asymptotic relations do not apply exactly . nevertheless , they also show some regularities . additionally g - modes invade the p - mode region and decrease the spacing in a small frequency region of about two radial orders .",
    "this effect , known as avoided crossing ( osaki 1975 , aizenman , smeyers & weigert 1977 ) , complicates the theoretical frequency spectra , but can provide information about the stellar interior ( dziembowski & pamyatnykh 1991 ) . moreover , stellar rotation splits multiplets and this splitting is non - symmetric , if second - order effects of rotation and effects of rotational mode coupling are taken into account ( dziembowski & goode 1992 , soufi et al .",
    "1998 , pamyatnykh et al . 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the spacing of adjacent radial orders as well as the rotational splitting is still regular enough to be detectable , if complete multiplets are excited and identified .",
    "we will demonstrate this by using a pulsation model of a 1.85@xmath61 star with @xmath62k , @xmath63 , and @xmath64km / s .",
    "this model will be referred to as model  1 .",
    "the parameters for the model were not chosen at random , but can be regarded as an estimate for fg  vir .    to investigate the period regularities , winget et al .",

    "is not expected for fg  vir , the method is not optimal for this @xmath8  scuti star .",
    "instead , we use a method which does not require such a coherence : an examination of a histogram of the observed frequency differences between all detected frequencies . in such a diagram",
    ", regularities in the frequency spacing of adjacent radial orders of modes with the same degree , @xmath0 , should show up as a peak .",
    "furthermore , modes of different degree are shifted in frequency relatively to each other , but would still have similar patterns and , therefore , contribute to the peaks in the histogram .",
    "the frequency spacing is examined in fig .  1 with both the theoretically predicted and observed spacings .",
    "pulsation models show a typical frequency spacing of @xmath65c / d for adjacent radial orders of p - modes , independent of the degree of the modes . the leftmost peaks in the top panels of fig .",
    "1 are caused by rotationally split multiplets .",
    "a similar diagram for @xmath66 ( not plotted separately ) does not show such strong peaks in the expected region .",
    "the reason is that both the presence of g - modes in addition to the p - modes and non - equidistant rotational splitting significantly disturb the regularity in the distribution of quadrupole mode frequencies ( see fig .",
    "7 below . ) as a result , the combined pattern of frequency spacings for all @xmath67 modes becomes much less clear .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that only low - order oscillations are present in this frequency range , there is no additional peak at @xmath68 c / d as might be expected from the asymptotic spacing between p - modes of adjacent degrees ( see fig .  7 for more details ) .",
    "next , we turn to the observed frequency spacing for the 24 certain and 8 probable frequency detections of fg  vir ( table  1 )",
    ". the most cautious approach would be to use the 24 certain frequencies with a few exceptions : the 2@xmath11 term at 25.4  c / d ( reflecting the departure from a pure sinusoidal light curve shape of @xmath11 ) , the two combination frequencies ( the pulsation models can not yet predict which combinations and resonances are excited ) , and the two low - frequency modes for which the p - mode character can definitely be excluded from the assumption that @xmath16 is the radial fundamental mode . to show that the agreement between the theoretically predicted and observed frequency spacing is not based on the choice of frequencies , the analysis was repeated by including the 8 additional probable modes listed in table 1 .    to conclude , the theoretical and observed frequency spacings agree quite well . in particular , for frequency differences in the 0  5  c / d range , two features near 3.9 and 0.8  c / d stand out , suggesting an identification with the spacing of successive radial orders and rotational splitting , respectively .",
    "the relative phase difference between the temperature and radius variations of a pulsating star leads to an observable phase difference between the light curves at different wavelengths .",
    "the sizes of these phases differences depend not only on the properties of the star , but also on the type of pulsation mode .",

    "the atlas9 models of kurucz ( 1993 ) were used to construct a model atmosphere for fg vir .",
    "garrido et al . ( 1990 ) presented calculations using values of @xmath75 ranging from 90@xmath76 to 135@xmath76 . for fg vir , viskum ( 1997 ) determined a smaller range , viz .",

    "this change was indicated by measurements of high - amplitude @xmath8 scuti stars .",
    "the theoretical predictions are shown in fig .  2 together with the observations .",
    "the importance of considering the dependence on the pulsation constant , @xmath10 , can be seen for @xmath10 = 0.02 , where one can even find negative values of the phase difference for radial modes , although the separation between radial and nonradial modes is always maintained .",
    "our best mode identifications based on strmgren photometry are shown in table 2 .",
    "we obtained five unambiguous @xmath0 values , while for three further modes we can not distinguish between two adjacent @xmath0 values .",
    "the frequency @xmath16 , shown in the middle panel , is situated to the right of the @xmath0 = 0 by 1.9 @xmath78 .",

    "irrespective of which of the two values for @xmath16 is accepted , an identification with radial pulsation is consistent within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "we can now compare the results from the photometric method with those derived from a promising new technique of examining the equivalent width variations of selected lines .",

    "we note that on the observational side the photometric and spectroscopic methods are independent .",

    "the figure shows that some of excellent agreement may be accidental once the observational uncertainties are considered .",
    "nevertheless , the viability of both methods to determine @xmath0 values has been demonstrated and for at least six modes the @xmath0 values have been observationally determined .",

    "we will now calculate new models utilizing the newly discovered pulsation frequencies and mode identifications .      to compute models of fg  vir",
    "we used a standard stellar evolution code which was developed in its main parts by b.  paczyski , m.  kozowski and r.  sienkiewicz ( private communication ) .",
    "the same code was used in our recent studies of period changes in @xmath8  scuti stars ( breger & pamyatnykh 1998 ) and in a seismological study of xx  pyx ( pamyatnykh et al .",
    "these two papers include detailed descriptions of the model computations , so that the present decription can be brief . for the opacities",

    "1996 ) .",
    "the computations were performed starting with chemically uniform models on the zams , assuming typical population i values of hydrogen abundance , @xmath81 , and heavy element abundance , @xmath82 .",
    "the initial heavy element mixture of grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) was adopted .    in some models",
    ", a possibility of overshooting from the convective core was taken into account .",
    "the overshooting distance , @xmath83 , was chosen to be @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the local pressure scale height at the edge of the convective core .",
    "examples of evolutionary tracks for @xmath8  scuti models computed with and without overshooting are given in breger & pamyatnykh ( 1998 ) .",
    "in the stellar envelope the standard mixing - length theory of convection with the mixing - length parameter @xmath79 = 1.0 or 2.0 was used .",
    "as we will see below , the choice of the mixing - length parameter @xmath86 has only a small effect on our models , because they are too hot to have an effective energy transfer by convection in the stellar envelope .    in all computations we assumed uniform ( solid - body ) stellar rotation and conservation of global angular momentum during evolution from the zams .",
    "these assumptions were chosen due to their simplicity .",
    "the influence of rotation on the evolutionary tracks of @xmath8  scuti models was demonstrated by breger & pamyatnykh ( 1998 ) .",
    "we studied models of fg  vir with equatorial rotational velocities from , approximately , 30 to 90 km / s ( on the zams , the values are 5 - 10 km / s higher ) .",
    "this range is consistent with the values of @xmath87km / s and @xmath88 found by mantegazza et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and an equatorial velocity of @xmath89km / s obtained by viskum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . at such low rotational velocities ,",
    "the evolutionary tracks are located very close to those for non - rotating stellar models .",
    "the main effect of rotation to be considered is the splitting of multiplets in the oscillation frequency spectra .",
    "this splitting is non - symmetric even for slowly rotating stars , if second - order effects are included .",
    "the linear nonadiabatic analysis of low - degree oscillations ( @xmath0@xmath904 ) was performed using the code developed by dziembowski ( 1977 ) . in the modern version of the code ,",
    "effects of slow stellar rotation on oscillation frequencies are taken into account up to second order in the rotational velocity ( dziembowski & goode 1992 , soufi et  al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the models for fg  vir were constructed with the observed mode @xmath16 ( 12.154  c / d ) being identified with the radial fundamental mode ( = * f * ) ( see section  3 ) .",
    "note that this determines the mean density of all possible models of fg  vir : with the pulsation constant of about 0.032 ",
    "0.034  days , which is typical for @xmath8  scuti variables , we obtain @xmath91 0.150.17 .",
    "a considerably more accurate value of the density will be obtained later in this section .",
    "we started with the construction of evolutionary tracks of 1.75  1.95 @xmath92 models for initial abundances @xmath93 and @xmath94 and using opal opacities .",
    "no overshooting from the convective core was allowed .",
    "the initial equatorial rotational velocity on the zams was chosen to be 50 km / s .",
    "with our assumption of conservation of global angular momentum , the equatorial rotational velocity is decreasing during the ms  evolution from 50 km / s at the zams to about 4041 km / s at the tams ( terminal  age ",
    "main  sequence ) .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are shown in fig .  4 together with the range in effective temperature and gravity of fg  vir ( see introduction ) derived from photometric calibrations ( @xmath95  k and @xmath96 ) .",
    "this range requires ms models and constrains the mass of the models to 1.751.95  @xmath92 .",
    "the position of the models , whose * f*-mode has a value of 12.154  c / d is also shown .",
    "this further constrains the mass to 1.8151.875  @xmath92 .",
    "we stress that this strong seismological mass constraint depends on an accurate effective temperature determination .",
    "the identification of @xmath97 * f * agrees well with the gravity estimate for fg  vir .",
    "this provides no additional constraints on the stellar mass since the lines of constant frequencies are approximately parallel to those of constant gravity , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 .    for a given family of stellar models ,",
    "the radial fundamental pulsation constant , @xmath10 , is constant with a quite high accuracy due to the homologous structure of models of different masses . for @xmath98 = 1.80  1.90 @xmath92 in the range @xmath99 = 3.869  3.881 ( @xmath4 = 7400  7600",
    "k ) , the pulsation constant @xmath10 = 0.0326 with relative accuracy of about 0.2 % . the accuracy will be still higher by approximately one order of magnitude if we consider only models based on @xmath97 * f*. for these models we determine a mean density of @xmath100 .",
    "however , such an extremely high accuracy is based on a fixed choice of input physics : stellar opacity , initial chemical composition , rotational velocity and parameters of convection .",
    "we will see in the next subsection that changing these parameters results in significantly larger spread of mean density for fg vir models .",
    "standard models . the equatorial rotational velocity on the zams",
    "was chosen to be 50  km / s .",
    "on the tams ( at the turn - off points to the left ) , equatorial velocities are of about 4041  km / s .",
    "dashed lines show effective temperature and @xmath6 ranges of fg  vir from photometric calibrations .",
    "the thin solid line connects models whose radial fundamental mode frequency is 12.154  c / d .",
    "the rotational velocity of the models along this line is about 45  km / s , width=332 ]    the strict constraint on mass is demonstrated in fig .  5 , where the changes of radial and dipole frequencies during ms evolution are shown .",
    "this agreement is an independent qualitative argument in favour of the proposed models for fg  vir .",
    "another important result is the good agreement of the predicted frequency range of unstable modes with the observed frequency range of 934  c / d .",
    "an additional test shows that should we identify @xmath16 with the first radial overtone instead of the * f*-mode , we can not achieve agreement between the theoretical and observed frequency ranges : in the corresponding models of @xmath101 the instability occurs in the frequency range of 830  c / d . the tendency in models of higher mass to shift the instability range to lower frequencies",
    "can be also seen in fig .",
    "there is an even stronger argument against these higher - mass models : their luminosities are too high ( @xmath102 ) to be consistent with both the photometric calibrations and the hipparcos parallax .",
    "a number of gravity modes must be excited in fg  vir , if the assumption of @xmath97 * f * is true , because the two lowest frequencies are more than 25% lower than the * f*-mode . moreover , during the ms - evolution the frequencies of low - order g - modes increase and approach consecutively the frequencies of low - order p - modes resulting in mode interactions and avoided crossings ( see unno et al .",
    "1989 and references therein ) .",
    "the frequency spectrum is much more complicated than in the case of pure p- or g - modes , as shown in fig .  5 for dipole modes .",
    "the avoided crossing phenomenon takes place approximately in the middle of the observed frequency interval .",
    "therefore , most of the excited modes at these and at lower frequencies are of mixed character : they behave like p - modes in the envelope and like g - modes in the interior . in the 1.85  @xmath92 model with @xmath103 ,",
    "modes @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are of mixed character .",
    "the frequencies of modes at avoided crossing are sensitive to the structure of the deep stellar interior .",
    "consequently , the detection of these modes is important for testing convective overshooting theories ( dziewbowski & pamyatnykh 1991 )",
    ".    avoided crossings for quadrupole modes in the models of fg  vir occur close to the upper border of the observed frequency interval and also close to the * f*-mode .",
    "this means that most of @xmath107 p - modes in the interval already interacted with gravity modes and are of mixed character .      the 1.85 @xmath92 model for fg  vir , which was discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "will be referred to as the standard or reference model with the input parameters : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110  km / s and opal opacities . to examine the effects of varying input parameters on the predicted frequency spectrum , all these and the stellar mass were varied , under the condition that @xmath111 .",
    "model 12 seems to be the best - fitting model in our series .",
    "note the excellent agreements in both frequency and @xmath0identifications for all ten dominant frequencies .",
    "the mean difference ( o - c ) is about 0.04  c / d for these modes .",
    "the fit for most of the remaining frequencies is also good , once @xmath112 @xmath113 modes are considered .",
    "possible discrepances at low frequencies do not appear serious to us due to the strong sensitivity of g - modes to model parameters . because of the effects of avoided crossing some of the quadrupole modes of higher order are also quite sensitive to small variations of parameters ( cf .",

    "8 we compare the range of observed frequencies and of excited modes explicitly for the reference model as well as three other models .",
    "fg  vir is located in the hr - diagram in the middle of the instability strip ( see , for example , breger & pamyatnykh 1998 ) . consequently , the driving of oscillations is effective in a wide frequency region which extends over 7 radial overtones .",
    "the independence of the driving efficiency on the mode degree , @xmath0 , is typical for the oscillations excited by the opacity mechanism .",
    "we also note that the observed frequency spectrum is divided clearly into two groups : at 9 - 13 c / d and at 19 - 25 c / d .",
    "however , the present models do not predict any instability gap in frequency , as can be seen in fig .",

    "only axisymmetric modes ( @xmath115 ) are shown .",
    "positive values correspond to unstable modes .",
    "vertical lines mark observed frequencies from table  1 , probable frequencies @xmath37 to @xmath44 are shorter . the longest line at 12.716  c",
    "/ d corresponds to the mode @xmath11 with the highest amplitude , width=332 ]      an additional factor which influences the frequencies of a rotating star is the coupling between modes with close frequencies whose azimuthal orders , @xmath116 , are the same and whose degrees , @xmath0 , are also the same or differ by 2 . the effect was described and discussed in detail by dziembowski & goode ( 1992 ) and by soufi et al .",
    "the frequency distance between two near - degenerate modes increases when coupling is taken into account .",
    "the significance of this rotational frequency perturbation was demonstrated by pamyatnykh et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in application to xx  pyx .",
    "it was shown that at rotational velocity of about 90 km / s the frequency shifts of coupled radial and quadrupole ( or dipole and octupole ) overtones achieve 0.10.2 c / d .",
    "therefore , in particular , a significant change of radial frequency ratios may be expected .",
    "we estimated this effect in some of our fg  vir models and found it to be unimportant at rotational velocities of about and less than 45 km / s .",
    "for example , for the reference model 1 , the frequencies of the radial fundamental mode , @xmath117 , and of the third overtone , @xmath118 , are changed due to coupling with closest axisymmetric quadrupole modes by -0.0035 c / d and 0.0091 c / d , respectively .",
    "the effect is much stronger for more rapidly rotating models : for model 5 with @xmath119 = 90  km / s , the radial fundamental mode and third overtone are shifted by -0.0436 c / d and 0.1545 c / d , respectively , which results in the change of the frequency ratio from 0.5266 to 0.5212 .",
    "as another example , we were able to reproduce the observed ratio @xmath120 as the radial frequency ratio for a model with initial abundances @xmath121 , @xmath122 and with @xmath119 = 91 - 92  km / s .",
    "however , the rapid rotation seems to be rather improbable for fg  vir with @xmath87km / s , as it was discussed by viskum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "note that the coupling effect is higher for higher overtones : for model 5 , the shift of the radial sixth overtone frequency ( 34.306 c / d ) is 0.520 c / d due to interaction with the closest axisymmetric quadrupole mode of 34.219 c / d which is shifted by the same quantity 0.520 c / d in the opposite direction .",
    "moreover , @xmath66 modes are affected by coupling with @xmath123 modes , and so on .",
    "we conclude that for rapidly rotating models it is necessary to take the rotational coupling into account in attempts to fit the observed frequency spectrum with the theoretical one .",
    "the rotational coupling results also in a mutual contamination of amplitudes of spherical harmonic components of interacting modes ( soufi et al 1998 , see examples in table 4 of pamyatnykh et al .",
    "this adversely affects the mode discrimination by means of multicolor photometry ( see the footnote in section 3 ) and should influence spectroscopic determinations as well .",
    "however , this effect was found to be important only in models with more rapid rotation than found for fg  vir .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the rotational mode coupling problem in connection with the interpretation of the observed multifrequency spectrum will be given by dziembowski & goupil ( 1998 ) .",
