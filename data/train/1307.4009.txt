    "many of the key theoretical developments in condensed matter physics have been concerned with the exploration of models that capture important aspects of the behavior of real materials .",
    "one of the most fundamental and useful model systems in the field is the _ homogeneous electron gas _ ( heg).@xcite the simplicity of the system ( a gas of electrons moving in a uniform , neutralizing background ) is deceptive : the model exhibits a rich range of physics and remains our basic starting point for understanding the behavior of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors .",
    "the enormous theoretical challenge that must be overcome when trying to provide an accurate description of the heg is that the electrons are strongly coupled by their mutual coulomb repulsion .",
    "nevertheless , many thermal and transport properties of the heg can be described by ignoring electron - electron interactions altogether , resulting in the free - electron - gas model , in which each electron has its own well - defined energy and momentum .",
    "this observation , which predates quantum mechanics , was first explained within a general theoretical framework by landau through the development of fermi liquid theory.@xcite although the existence of electron - electron repulsion and hence correlation dramatically changes the total energy of an electron gas , low - lying excitations have a nonvanishing overlap with the corresponding excitations of the noninteracting system , in which the single - particle orbitals are plane - wave momentum eigenstates .",
    "hence we may associate each excited state of the interacting system with a particular set of _ quasiparticle _ momentum occupation numbers .",
    "remarkably , although fermi liquid theory is our basic paradigm for the normal behavior of the fluid phase of an electron gas , quantitative values for the parameters that occur in this theory are essentially unknown .",
    "armed with knowledge of the fermi liquid parameters , we would have a complete parameterization of the low - energy excitations of the fully interacting electron gas .",
    "this would in turn allow nearly all thermodynamic , response , and transport properties to be determined quantitatively,@xcite enabling us to understand the precise role that correlation plays in the behavior of the heg .    in this work we use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations@xcite to determine the fermi liquid parameters of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) heg .",
    "specifically , we have employed the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) methods.@xcite vmc calculations involve taking the expectation value of a many - electron hamiltonian with respect to a trial wave function that can be of arbitrary complexity . in our work ,",
    "the trial wave function was optimized by minimizing first the variance of the energy,@xcite then the energy expectation value@xcite with respect to wave - function parameters . in dmc@xcite",
    "we simulate a process governed by the schrdinger equation in imaginary time in order to project out the ground - state component of an initial wave function .",
    "we use the fixed - node approximation@xcite to impose fermionic antisymmetry .",
    "all our qmc calculations were performed using the casino code.@xcite    in refs .   and we presented dmc calculations of the 2d heg single - particle energy band @xmath0 , enabling us to predict the quasiparticle effective mass @xmath1 . in the present work we use dmc calculations to determine the landau interaction functions@xcite and",
    "hence fermi liquid parameters .",
    "our approach is similar to that of the pioneering work of kwon _",
    "et al._,@xcite which was undertaken eighteen years ago and is , to our knowledge , the only previous attempt to calculate the fermi liquid parameters directly using qmc .",
    "_  were unable to obtain consistent quantitative results , primarily because of the extremely small system sizes that they were forced to use at that time .",
    "however , there have been enormous developments in qmc methodology and computer power in the last two decades , and the time has come to revisit this grand - challenge problem .",
    "the major causes of computational expense in this work are ( i ) the need to overcome the finite - size errors in the fermi liquid parameters by performing calculations at a range of system sizes and ( ii ) the fact that even for small numbers of electrons it is necessary to take the difference of very similar total energies to obtain the interaction functions .",
    "point ( ii ) makes every aspect of this work computationally expensive : not only does each qmc calculation have to be sufficiently long that the statistical error bars are small compared with the differences to be resolved , but it must be ensured that the trial wave function is very highly optimized .",
    "these calculations were only made possible by access to the jaguar machine at oak ridge leadership computing facility .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : landau_e_fnal ] we give an overview of the relevant aspects of fermi liquid theory and describe our computational approach to the problem .",

    "we use hartree atomic units , in which the dirac constant , the electronic charge and mass , and @xmath2 times the permittivity of free space are unity ( @xmath3 ) , throughout .",
    "the landau energy functional@xcite is a parameterization of the energies of the ground state and low - lying excited states of the heg : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the change to the ground - state quasiparticle occupation number for wavevector @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the ground - state energy . sufficiently close to the fermi surface , the energy band @xmath9 is linear in @xmath10 and",
    "hence we may write @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermi energy , @xmath13 is the fermi wavevector , and @xmath1 is the quasiparticle effective mass .",
    "the landau interaction function @xmath14 describes energy contributions arising from pairs of quasiparticles .",
    "close to the fermi surface we may neglect the dependence of @xmath15 on the magnitudes of the wavevectors and write the landau interaction functions as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angle between @xmath6 and @xmath18 .",

    "the suffixes @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( for `` symmetric '' and `` antisymmetric '' ) correspond to addition and subtraction in the integrand , respectively . for a fully ferromagnetic heg ,",
    "the @xmath19th fermi liquid parameter is defined as @xmath27 where the quasiparticle density of states per unit area is @xmath28 .",
    "the total energy of a finite heg in hartree - fock theory can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the madelung constant , @xmath23 is the number of electrons , @xmath31 is the area of the simulation cell and @xmath32 is the set of occupied states for spin @xmath7 .",
    "the hartree - fock energy is already in the form of the landau energy functional and hence within hartree - fock theory the energy band is @xmath33 for ground - state unoccupied wavevectors , where @xmath34 is the set of states occupied in the ground state , and @xmath35 for ground - state occupied wavevectors .",
    "it also follows immediately from eq .",

    "our qmc calculations were performed for electron gases in finite cells subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the available wavevectors @xmath54 are therefore the reciprocal lattice points of the simulation cell .",
    "the use of a finite cell prevents the description of long - range coulomb and correlation effects,@xcite giving rise to finite - size errors in the fermi liquid parameters .",
    "we have calculated the landau interaction functions via total - energy differences in finite cells , used these to evaluate the fermi liquid parameters , then extrapolated the parameters to the thermodynamic limit , where they should become independent of the choice of simulation cell and the precise excitations made to determine the interaction functions .",
    "in our calculations we have used square simulation cells with simulation - cell bloch vector@xcite @xmath55 .",
    "there exist quantities such as the ground - state total energy , pair - correlation function , and static structure factor that can be twist averaged@xcite in the conventional sense ( i.e. , one can evaluate estimators for these quantities at different simulation - cell bloch vectors @xmath56 and then average the results ) . however , there are other quantities such as the momentum density , the energy band , and the landau interaction functions for which @xmath56 determines the set of wavevectors at which the quantities are defined in a finite cell , so that by using different @xmath56 we may obtain additional points on the quantity as a function of wavevector .",
    "the computational effort required to obtain excitation energies at different @xmath56 is essentially the same as the computational effort required to obtain excitation energies by considering completely different excitations .",
    "since the latter approach provides data that are in some sense more independent , we concluded that our computational effort was better invested in studying different excitations as opposed to changing @xmath56 .",
    "the number of electrons in the ground state was chosen to be a `` magic number , '' corresponding to a closed - shell configuration in each case . for ferromagnetic hegs ,",
    "our calculations were performed with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 electrons in the ground state . for paramagnetic hegs",
    "our calculations were performed with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 electrons in the ground state .",
    "the simulation - cell area was held constant when electrons were added to or removed from the ground - state configuration . in the case of noninteracting electrons",
    "this gives the energy band ( @xmath64 ) and landau interaction functions ( zero ) exactly without finite - size error .",
    "( note that in the free - electron model there are finite - size errors due to momentum quantization in the total energy , but no finite - size errors in the excitation energies . ) for interacting electrons , the fact that the density changes when electrons are added or subtracted may be a source of finite - size error , but the error involved is certainly much smaller than the error that would result from allowing the cell area to change .",
    "we used trial wave functions of slater - jastrow - backflow form.@xcite more detailed information about our trial wave functions can be found in ref .  . in ref .",
    "we argued that our dmc calculations for the 2d heg retrieve more than 99% of the correlation energy .",
    "the dmc time steps used in our calculations were @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 a.u .  at @xmath68 , 5 , and 10 , respectively , for paramagnetic hegs , and @xmath69 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 a.u .  at @xmath68 , 5 , and 10 , respectively , for ferromagnetic hegs .",
    "at @xmath70 we find the vmc energy variance per electron to be @xmath71 and @xmath72 a.u .  for paramagnetic and ferromagnetic hegs , respectively .",
    "thus our trial wave functions are considerably more accurate for ferromagnetic hegs , in which exchange effects are dominant .",
    "this suggests that it might be advantageous to use pairing ( geminal ) orbitals for opposite - spin electrons in paramagnetic hegs.@xcite another possibility for improving the trial wave function would be to use different jastrow factors@xcite and backflow functions for each shell of plane - wave orbitals .",
    "however , given the expense of our calculations , there is at present little scope for using more sophisticated wave - function forms .",
    "the dmc landau interaction functions at @xmath68 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : int_params_rs1 ] , [ fig : int_params_rs5 ] , and [ fig : int_params_rs10 ] , respectively .",
    "the statistical error bars are very much smaller for ferromagnetic hegs than for paramagnetic hegs , reflecting the relative accuracy of the trial wave functions in the two cases ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : trial_wf ] ) . note that the data points are correlated , and so the error bars should be interpreted with caution .",
    "the hartree - fock interaction function ( i.e. , the exchange interaction : see sec .",
    "[ sec : hf ] ) is reasonably accurate at large @xmath75 , but the parallel - spin interaction function is pathological as @xmath76 due to the lack of screening .     for 2d hegs of density parameter @xmath68 , multiplied by system size @xmath23 .",
    "the parallel- and antiparallel - spin interaction functions in a paramagnetic heg are shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , while the interaction function in a fully ferromagnetic heg is shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "all results were obtained with a slater - jastrow - backflow trial wave function , except where labeled `` sj , '' in which case a slater - jastrow wave function was used .",
    "the results labeled `` + + '' were obtained in double - addition calculations , whereas those labeled `` @xmath77 '' were obtained in double - subtraction calculations .",
    "all other results were obtained by promoting a single electron , leaving a hole .",
    "note that the data points within each curve are correlated : for example , the interaction - function values at a given system size all depend on the dmc estimate of the ground - state energy . for comparison , we show the hartree - fock ( hf ) `` interaction functions '' for infinite system size [ eqs .",

    "[ fig : int_params_rs10],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the differences between the slater - jastrow and slater - jastrow - backflow dmc data are significant , confirming that the former are insufficiently accurate , as argued in ref .  .",
    "there is a significant difference between the landau interaction functions obtained from dmc calculations in which a single electron is promoted and calculations in which pairs of electrons are added or pairs of electrons are removed from the ground - state configuration .",
    "finite - size effects in promotion energies are expected to be smaller because the density of the heg in a finite cell is unchanged by such excitations , unlike double additions or subtractions .",
