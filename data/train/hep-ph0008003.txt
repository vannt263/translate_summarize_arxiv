    "one of the great achievements of theoretical high energy physics in the last thirty years has been the discovering and development of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the smallness of the coupling constant at high momenta ( asymptotic freedom ) has allowed to develop a perturbative framework applicable for very high energy processes .",
    "that situation strongly simplifies the study of such phenomena and the calculated quantities are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is far from being able to furnish even a rough description for the relevant physics at low energies .",
    "the solution of this situation is currently one of the main challenges of particle physics .",
    "a relevant phenomenon related with qcd is the color confinement .",
    "nowadays , there are strong reasons to believe that the relation between the basic quantities in qcd , like the gluon and quarks fields , and the real world characterized by a whole variety of interacting mesons and baryons , can be understood by solving the confinement problem .",
    "the basic picture which seems plausible to be derived from qcd is that the fundamental fields can not be associated to asymptotic states of quark and gluons and then the true physical states consist only of colorless composites of quarks and gluons ( mesons and baryons ) .",
    "the above quoted limitations of the pqcd mean in particular that the usual fock space vacuum of the non - interacting theory , is unable to predict , even approximately , the real ground state properties of qcd @xcite .",
    "this is at contrast with the case in qed where the standard perturbation theory gives a better than good concordance with the experimental data .",
    "then , the nature of vacuum structure is one of the main problems to be clarified and naturally its solution is closely linked with the color confinement effect .",
    "reviews of various models considered to investigate the confinement and the vacuum structure in qcd can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another basic problem for qcd is the one related with the quark masses , that is , the so called current quarks masses which appear in the lagrangian .",
    "as the quarks are not observed as free states , the meaning of the quark masses need to be considered with care @xcite .",
    "the nature of these parameters is an important object of research since long time ago @xcite .",
    "the relations among these masses and their magnitude have been determined through the methods of current algebra in combination with measurements of the light mesons masses .",
    "in the former works @xcite an attempt directed to construct a modified perturbation expansion for qcd being able to predict at least some low energy properties of this theory have been considered .",
    "first , in @xcite , the modified expansion conserving the color @xmath10 and lorentz symmetries was proposed , aiming to solve the symmetry limitations of the earlier chromo - magnetic field models @xcite which inspired the search .",
    "a similar lack of manifest lorentz invariance had also a modification of the feynman rules , intending to include gluon condensation , advanced later in @xcite in which a delta function for @xmath11 was summed to the perturbative piece .",
    "the expansion proposed in @xcite , considers a change of the gluon propagator in a term associated to a condensation of zero momentum gluons .",
    "this alteration of the usual rules had the interesting property of producing a non vanishing value for the gluon condensation parameter @xmath12 already in the first approximations @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite a non vanishing value for the effective self - energy of the gluons was obtained at the loop level .",
    "finally , a perturbative evaluation of the effective potential as a function of the condensate parameter indicated that the condensation is spontaneously generated from a zero condensate state .",
    "the next work @xcite , had as a main objective to justify the applicability of the feynman expansion introduced in @xcite .",
    "this search was in need because after modifying the propagator , it was unknown whether or not the initial wavefunction generating the expansion was a physical state of the free theory . in @xcite , by making use of the operational formulation of qcd developed by kugo and ojima @xcite , it was possible to find a physical state of the non - interacting theory being able to generate through the wick expansion , the sort of propagators considered in @xcite .",
    "the discussion allowed also a more precise characterization of the class of changes admitted in the diagrammatic expansion by the physical state condition on the initial state .",
    "specifically , it was found that the @xmath5 parameter , describing the gluon condensation , must be real and positive .",
    "the present work is an expanded version of a letter sent to publication .",
    "its main objective is to evaluate first @xmath3 in terms of the condensate parameter @xmath13up to order @xmath4 , in order to determine the quark masses after fixing the parameter @xmath14 to reproduce the accepted value for @xmath15 .",
    "the essential result is the evaluation of the constituent masses for the light quarks . in order to perform it ,",
    "we have made use of the recent values reported for the current masses @xcite .",
    "the idea inspiring the work was the possibility that the gluon condensation described by modified expansion could predict the appearance of large masses for the light quarks ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) of the order of 1/3 of the nucleon mass ( constituent quark mass ) , thus furnishing an explanation for the successful constituent quark models .",
    "surprisingly , after fixing the condensate parameter @xmath14 to reproduce the most accepted value of the @xmath15 ( through the here performed evaluation of this quantity in terms of @xmath14 ) , it followed that the light quarks @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 got exactly the needed constituent like values for the masses in one of the propagation modes of the modified mass shell .",
    "the free propagation modes , which are at discrepancy with the absence of free quarks , are here only arising within an approximation evaluating the main effects of the condensate . after the inclusion of all the terms completing the one loop approximation in the gluon self - energy",
    "an interesting picture arises .",
    "it follows that the previously free propagation modes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks turn to be confined . on another hand ,",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks waves become damped .",
    "that is , the squared rest mass get complex values .",
    "it should be stressed that the peaked structure of the propagator for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath16 signals the value of @xmath17 as the one expected to appear in the kinetic energy terms @xmath18 defining the free part of the bound state equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 constituted nucleons .",
    "henceforth , a possible mechanism contributing to justify the drastic difference between the stability of nucleons and the higher resonances is suggested .",
    "the absence of propagating modes for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , might be assuring the absolute stability shown by the nucleons bound states .",
    "in other manner , the presence of damped modes in the rest of the quarks would contribute to the decaying channels observed for all the hadron resonances associated to these short lived states .",
    "next , after considering the ground state within each of the baryon resonance groups as classified in @xcite and its set of three constituent quarks , and adding the calculated quark masses for each of them ( which depends on the flavor through the assumed values of the current masses ) , a spectrum of baryon masses was estimated .",
    "the results again reproduce reasonably well the experimentally determined resonance energies @xcite .",
    "this outcome suggests the less relevant role of the interaction energy among quarks in determining the masses of these hadrons .    at this point",
    "it is important to make clear that earlier works @xcite introduced a pure delta function at zero momentum in the gluon propagator , searching for a model of meson resonances . in these treatments the constants introduced , multiplying the delta function , were different to the one fixed in our previous work @xcite , leading also to very different results .",
    "in particular , the singularity structure of the quark propagator have no poles on the real @xmath19 axis @xcite at difference with our results .",
    "this difference is directly connected with the definite sign for the coefficient of the @xmath20-function which in our case was precisely determined in @xcite . since our analysis in that paper",
    "was based in the direct construction of the state incorporating the condensate , it follows that the difference with the results of @xcite is rooted in a corresponding difference in the initial state determining the wick expansion",
    ". it could be also possible that both procedures lead to the same exact physical predictions , but the first approximations in each approach could turn to be more appropriate for the discussion of specific physical issues .",
    "this question will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "it should be also further noticed that gluon condensate states reproducing the modified expansion of @xcite have been also discussed in @xcite",
    ". however , all these references are related with states showing confined quarks and massive gluons , at variance with our proposed state determining massive quarks ( in the simplest approximation ) and tachyonic gluons .",
    "it is also following that another dispersion relation is obtained which predicts a vanishing value of the mass as @xmath21 .",
    "this mode could be connected with the family of low mass mesons ( e.g. @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons ) .",
    "specifically , the possibility is open that the bound states of quark excitations in these light mass states of quarks could describe such low lying mesons within the here presented framework .",
    "a circumstance pointing in this direction is that the spontaneous chirality breaking associated with this mass generation should be expected to be associated with some massless goldstone modes .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the bound states of such modes predicted by the bethe - salpeter equations turn to describe the light mesons @xmath24 and @xmath23",
    ". this question however , will be deferred to a further study .",
    "the calculations of @xmath3 and the quark and gluon masses will be performed up order @xmath4 .",
    "it seems worth anticipating that the approximation scheme will resemble a sort of quasi - classical limit in which the condensate seems to play a role of a macroscopic mean quantum field .",
    "such an interpretation is in concordance with the initial motivation of our analysis as directed to construct a covariant version of the chromo - magnetic models @xcite .",
    "another conclusion which should be noticed is that the evaluated gluon mass determined from the allowed values of the condensate parameter @xmath14 is tachyonic .",
    "the possibility for a tachyonic gluon mass has been recently discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the free propagator of the expansion is not reproducing itself after the first approximation .",
    "this property , however , does not mean a limitation of the approach .",
    "this is because , at variance with @xcite , we are not assuming that the exact propagator has the same delta function structure .",
    "this form only arose for the free propagator as determined by the wick expansion around the considered initial state .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows : section ii is devoted to make precise the elements characterizing the modified perturbation expansion . in the section iii the calculation of the @xmath3 up to @xmath4 order for gluodynamics is presented and the result used to estimate the condensation parameter @xmath14 .",
    "further in section iv the effects of the condensate on the quark masses are evaluated and the obtained values used to estimate the spectrum of the ground states in each baryon group as classified in @xcite . in section v the calculation of the effect of the condensate on the one loop self - energy for the gluons is evaluated .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and some open questions and a conjecture are underlined in the last section vi .",
    "in this introductory section , the main elements and conventions of the modified expansion introduced in @xcite will be reviewed .",
    "the generating functional of the green functions in the modified theory has the form @xmath25 & = & \\frac 1n\\int d\\left ( a^r , \\bar{c}^r , c^r,\\bar{\\psi}^r,\\psi",

    "we think that no confusion should arise for it .",
    "the gluon field intensity has the usual form @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the covariant derivatives in the adjoint and fundamental representations of the group @xmath10 respectively @xmath30    here , the bare fields and bare coupling constant and masses ( @xmath31 ) , were expressed in terms of their renormalized counterparts following the same conventions of ref .",
    "below , the renormalized masses and coupling will be denoted as @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "it should be recalled that as argued in @xcite the physical predictions for the value @xmath34 of the gauge parameter should have physical meaning whenever the adiabatic connection of the interaction does not lead the evolving state out the physical space .",
    "therefore here we will fix this value of the parameter .    then , after the standard procedure of extracting out of the functional integral the exponential of the terms of higher than second order in the fields ( vertices ) the generating functional takes the form to be employed in the evaluations below @xcite : @xmath35 = n^{-1}\\exp \\left\\ { i\\left [ \\frac{s_{abc}^g}{3!i^3}\\frac{\\delta ^3}{\\delta j_a\\delta j_b\\delta j_c}+\\frac{s_{abcd}^g}{4!i^4}\\frac{\\delta ^4}{\\delta j_a\\delta j_b\\delta j_c\\delta j_d}\\right .",

    "use will be made of the dewitt compact notation @xcite , in which a latin letter let say @xmath39 , for a field symbolizes the space - time coordinates of it as well as all its internal quantum numbers .",
    "the same index in a source or a tensor symbolizes the same set of variables of the kind of fields associated with this specific index . for example @xmath40 .",
    "note that a particular convention has been also employed in which the same letter is employed for the global index ( for all the coordinated and internal indices ) and the one indicating the internal coordinates in the explicit form of the quantities .",
    "such a procedure was useful for the calculations and we also think that will not create confusion . as usual ,",
    "repeated indices represent the corresponding space time integrals and contracted , lorentz , spinor or color components .",
    "the following definitions also have been used in ( [ funct2 ] ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 mean the gluon , ghost and quark parts of the action respectively .",
    "there is only one main element determining the difference of the usual perturbative qcd expansion and the modified one considered in @xcite .",
    "it is related with the form of the gluon free propagator . as proposed in @xcite",
    "there is an additional term to the gluon free propagator which is absent in the standard expansion . in @xcite ,",
    "such a term was shown to be a consequence of a wick expansion based in a state constructed by acting on the usual vacuum with an exponential of pairs of zero momentum gluon and ghost creation operators .",
    "the ghost propagator @xcite could remain unmodified if the parameter left after fixing the form of the wave - function is taken as a real and positive one @xcite .",
    "such a selection will be employed here .",
    "the quark propagator is not affected in any way by the gluon condensation as introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , as it will be commented in the summary , the results of the present work led to the idea about a possible physical relevance of introducing quark condensates along the similar lines as it was done for the gluons .",
    "we consider the exploration of this possibility to be exposed as one of the most interesting extensions of the work .    a technical point can be noticed for precision .",
    "the operator quantization employed in @xcite takes the ghost fields as satisfying the conjugation properties proper of the approach of kugo and ojima @xcite .",
    "however , at the level of the feynman diagram expansion the difference with the standard procedure is only a change of variables .    in accordance with above remarks and the results of @xcite the diagram technique defining the modified expansion",
    "has the following basic propagators for the renormalized fields @xmath45 , \\\\",

    "the dimensional regularization and minimal substraction ( ms ) is the renormalization procedure employed here .",
    "being defined the feynman rules and the conventions to be used , below they will be applied to the calculation of various quantities of interest .",
    "the calculation of the mean value of the gluon field intensity squared is considered in this section .",
    "it extends the former evaluation done in @xcite within a simpler approximation .",
    "the result will be employed afterwards for fixing the value of the condensation parameter @xmath14 to be the necessary one for furnishing the currently estimated value for @xmath47 .",
    "the calculation will be performed up to order @xmath4 including all the dependence on the condensate .",
    "it is a helpful circumstance here , that the one loop renormalization procedure of the modified expansion can be performed identically as in the standard pqcd .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the @xmath48-functions kill the only existing integrals at the one loop level and therefore all the corresponding counterterms in the dimensional regularization are identical .",
    "this fact will be helpful in regularizing and renormalizing the composite operator @xmath49 .    for the evaluation of @xmath49 the following definition of this quantity",

    "let us consider below the evaluation of @xmath60 up to order @xmath4 .",
    "as any feynman diagram can be expressed as a polynomial in the constant @xmath5 , after associating a new diagrammatic line for this part of the free propagator , all the feynman diagrams can be divided in two groups .",
    "the first , let say @xmath61 including the diagrams not showing the new propagator line and another group , @xmath62 having one or more , let us call them , `` condensate '' lines .",
    "such lines have associated to them a multiplicative dirac delta function at zero momentum .",
    "after writing out all the expressions of type @xmath62 ( up to second order in the renormalized coupling @xmath4 ) contributing to ( [ des1 ] ) , it follows that the only non - vanishing diagram is the one appearing in the figure [ g2 ] in which both gluon lines are substituted by `` condensate '' lines .",
    "the remaining terms vanish thanks to the zero momentum evaluation produced by the dirac delta functions introduced by the `` condensate '' lines and also due to the vanishing of tadpoles in dimensional regularization .",
    "also , it should be underlined that the retention of the @xmath63 factors defining the feynman propagator , up to the evaluation of the integrals was also important in obtaining the zero result for some of the diagrams in @xmath62 .",
    "terms in the gluon condensate parameter . ]",
    "the contribution related with figure [ g2 ] had been calculated before and the result is @xcite @xmath64    next , the diagrams in @xmath61 are the ones contributing to @xmath46 up to order @xmath4 in standard perturbative qcd .",
    "they are illustrated in figure [ g3 ] .",
    "the terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the only non - vanishing and non - tadpole like second order contributions .",
    "it can be noticed that the appearance of two tadpoles in the term @xmath66 leads to the exact vanishing of this contribution in dimensional regularization .",
    "terms in the gluon condensate parameter . ]    for the diagram @xmath65 corresponds the expression @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the gluonic contribution to the polarization tensor in second order , which has been explicitly calculated . after substituting the known result for @xmath22 and performing the wick rotation , the previous expression turns out to be of the form @xmath69    then considering the formula @xcite @xmath70 for the case @xmath71 and fixing @xmath72 , it follows the vanishing of diagram @xmath65 within the dimensional regularization for @xmath73 .",
    "it rest now to discuss the contributions of the tadpole like diagrams .",
    "it is worth noticing at this point that they are quite similar in their form to the one corresponding to the square of the electromagnetic field strength in qed .",
    "in fact they differ from it only in some numerical color factors .",
    "an important quantitative difference between the expressions for both theories is related with magnitude of the coupling constant which is very much higher in qcd .",
    "let us consider the @xmath74 terms in figure [ g3 ] embodying the gluon , ghost and fermion contributions with the inclusion of the one loop counterterms rendering finite the polarization operator at one loop @xcite .",
    "this expression turns to be of the form @xmath75 where @xmath22 as usual is defined through the polarization tensor @xmath76 and it can be expressed as the superposition of the pure gluodynamical contribution and the quark one as @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath10 and @xmath80 is the scale mass in the dimensional regularization .    considering first the pure gluonic contributions associated @xmath81 in ( [ t15 ] ) , it follows that they reduce to a sum of dimensional regularized integrals of the same form as ( [ dimint ] ) .",
    "thus , the second order gluodynamical contribution of the tadpole like contributions vanish .",
    "let us analyze now the quark contributions associated to @xmath82 .",
    "it can be noticed that for massless quarks , that is @xmath83 , the @xmath82 has the same analytical dependence of @xmath19 as the gluonic part @xmath84 and all the quark contributions vanish after the regularization is employed .",
    "however , for massive quarks the result for the second order dimensionally regularized contribution along the same lines employed for the previous terms gives rise to a non - vanishing contribution of the following form after the substraction of the divergent pole terms at @xmath85 .",
    "the expression for the regularized term before substraction is @xmath86    this expression has simple as well as double poles which after substracted ( in the @xmath85 limit following the rules of the ms scheme for composite operators @xcite ) give a finite correction to @xmath15 for the gluon condensate parameter . it can be evaluated and the numerical expression becomes @xmath87 \\right).\\ ] ]    however , it should be noticed that this finite expression has been obtained for the second order correction of the polarization operator .",
    "the summation of the infinite ladder of self - energy insertions leading to the one loop propagator can be suspected to produce a noticeable modification of this result .",
    "after also considering the high indefiniteness in the quark current masses , and the technical difficulty we had in evaluating the dimensionally regularized expression for the above mentioned self - energy insertions , we decided to employ for the further consideration here the purely gluodynamical contribution . in support of this way of proceeding",
    "there is also another circumstance .",
    "it is needed to notice that a refined version of the definition of the composite operator @xmath88 could be suspected to exist in such a way that the terms associated to a tadpole diagram of the exact propagator vanish .",
    "this property would assure the exact vanishing of the @xmath89 in qed a property that to our knowledge , is expected . because , at one loop , both qed and qcd tadpole expressions are basically the same , the above written quark contribution would not really appear .",
    "the existence of the mentioned definition , opens the possibility for the second order gluodynamical contribution to be exact one for qcd in this approximation .",
    "however , we shift the discussion of this question to further analysis to be considered elsewhere and simply adopt the gluodynamical result .    therefore , the total second contribution to the mean value of @xmath46 in gluodynamics is defined by the only non - vanishing term @xmath90 coming from the condensate contributions arising from the diagram @xmath65 which is defined by the four gluon interactions .",
    "finally , let us determine in a phenomenological way a value for the constant @xmath14 by making use of a currently estimated value for @xmath91 : @xmath92 therefore , the parameter @xmath14 takes the value : @xmath93    this fixing of the condensation parameter allows to investigate the physical predictions of the modified expansion in the next section .",
    "let us consider now the effect on the current quark masses produced by the condensate .",
    "the full inverse propagator for the quarks in terms of the corresponding mass operator has the general expression @xmath94 where the color index identity matrix has been omitted and @xmath95 is the mass operator . its expression is related with the diagram in figure [ autoq ] .     in one loop . ]",
    "the form for @xmath96 up to order @xmath4 , within the modified feynman rules can be written as @xmath97 in which the color factor @xmath98 for the @xmath99 group is @xmath100 which for the case of interest here @xmath101 , reduces to @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the modified gluon propagator and the standard relations for the @xmath103 matrices ( which here are adopted in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the one loop mass operator expression is simplified to be @xmath104 let us disregard for the moment the term not involving the condensate parameter @xmath5 in order to first study the sole influence on the quark masses of the condensation effect .",
    "then , the expression for @xmath105 reduces to @xmath106 therefore , the inverse propagator for the quark takes the simple form @xmath107 where the constant @xmath108 is defined by @xmath109 in which the numerical value has been obtained by using ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "the zeros of the determinant associated to the inverse propagator ( [ prop2 ] ) then allows to determine the effects of the condensate ( reflected by the parameter @xmath108 ) , on the effective mass of the quarks .",
    "let below @xmath110 an index indicating each kind of quark characterized by its particular current mass @xmath111 .    in order to find the dependence of the effective quark mass @xmath112",
    "as a function of the current mass parameters @xmath111 an analysis was done for the zeros of the determinant of the inverse green function ( [ prop2 ] ) .",
    "it follows that there is only one solution having a squared mass being positive for arbitrary values of the current quark masses .",
    "the existence of this real and positive solution for the squared mass becomes possible thanks to the real and positive character of @xmath5 , as was shown previously @xcite .",
    "there is another interesting branch of the zeros of the determinant ( dispersion relations ) showing vanishing values for the effective mass in the light current mass limit .",
    "for the purely real solution the value of the effective quark mass @xmath113 as a function of @xmath111 is shown in the figure [ mass1 ] .",
    "the graph is plotted for the region @xmath114 which contains the current mass values of the @xmath115 and @xmath7 quarks .    as it can be appreciated in the picture",
    ", the calculated effective quark masses for light flavors ( @xmath116 and @xmath2 ) are clearly predicting the values of the quark masses being in use in the constituent quark models of the baryons .",
    "that is , the light quarks get a weight of near one third of the nucleon mass . in the table [ table1 ]",
    "the mass values obtained for each of the quark flavors are shown @xcite . from the global properties of table [ table1 ]",
    "it can be observed that the main effect of the gluon condensate seems to be the dressing the light quarks with a cloud gluons having a total mass of one third of the nucleon mass .",
    "then , the results point in the direction of the mainly glue nature of the constituent quark masses of the @xmath116 and @xmath2 quarks within many baryon resonance .",
    "these results then support the idea that a modified perturbative expansion like the one being considered , in which the effect of the gluon condensate have been incorporated , would be able to predict with reasonably good approximation properties of the low energy strong interactions .",
    "similar values for the constituent quarks masses have been obtained by different methods in @xcite .",
    ".quark mass values in presence of the condensate in units of @xmath117 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it can be appreciated the results obtained for the vector mesons and baryon resonance are only estimates",
    ". however , the obtained values are in a reasonable well correspondence with the reported experimental values .",
    "it can be also noticed that the validity of the present calculations implies that the binding energy contribution to the baryon rest masses should be small .",
    "this property then could justify a non relativistic description of such resonances .    as it was remarked before , another form of the dependence of the effective quark mass with @xmath111 is also following from the dispersion relations .",
    "it , by contrast shows a vanishing effective mass when @xmath118 .",
    "the existence of this branch opens the possibility for the existence an appropriate description of the light mesons ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) within the proposed scheme .",
    "they could be associated to bound states of light quarks propagating in such modes .",
    "the analysis of this question deserves a separate treatment to be examined elsewhere .",
    "the graphic for the mentioned branch is represented in figure [ mass2 ] , for the region of @xmath119 , a point at which the change in the analytic dependence signals where the solution gets an imaginary part when the current mass value @xmath32 grows .",
    "let us consider now the evaluation of the gluon self - energy .",
    "as it is known the exact gluon propagator can be written in the form @xmath120 where the function @xmath24 is defined at the one loop level , by the expression @xmath121 which is diagrammatically represented in figure [ autog ] .    .",
    "]    again , expanding in powers of the condensate parameter @xmath5 , the total contribution can be decomposed in the standard one ( associated to the ghost and the quark loop integrals ) and the @xmath5 dependent ones @xmath122 and @xmath123 which can be readily calculated to be @xmath124    summing up these particular two terms leads up to @xmath125 considering again our case the @xmath101 group , that is @xmath126 , and disregarding in a first consideration the standard one loop contribution , the function @xmath22 reduces to @xmath127 which in turns leads out to the following condition for the poles of ( [ gprop1 ] ) @xmath128 where @xmath129    therefore , as the parameter @xmath5 has been defined before as real and positive @xcite , it follows that the transverse gluon mass correction becomes tachyonic .",
    "the ability of a tachyonic mass in producing improvements in models for the inter quark potential has been recently argued in the literature @xcite .",
    "the effect is linked with the introduction of a linearly rising term as a first correction to the coulomb potential in the massless case @xcite .",
    "therefore , the tachyonic result arising here for the gluon mass appears to be of interest for a derivation , within the present framework , of former successful phenomenological bound state models for mesons @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to j.p .",
    "vary and j. qiu for the suggestion of this possibility .",
    "it should be also underlined that the tachyonic character of the gluon self - energy arising here , is fully compatible with the more general result of fukuda for the normal green functions in qcd , when gluon condensation is present @xcite .",
    "this circumstance then suggests , that the modified expansion under discussion could be a sort of perturbative representation of the fukuda non - perturbative treatment of the gluon condensation in qcd . in a different manner",
    ", the approach of celenza and shakin , and other authors can be expected to be related with a different initial state also incorporating gluon condensation .",
    "it could be the point that , at the end , both pictures can appear to be equivalent at the level of exact results",
    ". this could be the case because the physical degrees of freedom are not the gluons and quarks ones , but their colorless composite combinations which physics is determined by the bound state dispersion relations .    finally in this section it deserves to be stressed that",
    "if a modification of the ghost propagator is present , then a mass terms for the longitudinal propagator could also appear and the polarization operator ( gluon self - energy ) becomes non - transverse .",
    "this result means a violation of a ward identity representing the gauge invariance by the presence of ghost ( and fermion ) condensates .",
    "thus , it follows that the selection of the parameter of the initial state in @xcite was the appropriate one for the satisfaction of a gauge invariance condition at this stage .",
    "the physical meaning of the alternative procedures of constructing the initial state needs however for clarification .",
    "the following results can be enumerated :    \\1 ) a calculation of the mean value of @xmath46 up to order @xmath4 in gluodynamics , was performed .",
    "the result coincided with a previous one obtained in a simpler approximation @xcite and which signals that quartic gluon self - interaction is relevant in fixing a non - vanishing gluon condensation parameter already in the first order of the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) the one loop corrections for the quark masses under the influence of the condensate were evaluated .",
    "when only the terms reflecting the effect of the condensate are considered , the results for the constituent masses showed a branch which is real as a function of all the values of the quark current mass .",
    "another solution which is real up to a critical value of the lagrangian masses , and having a vanishing proper mass in the limit of small current masses is also obtained .",
    "the former branch predicts values of one third of the nucleon mass for the masses of the light quarks . the effective quark masses for all the quark flavors were evaluated as determined by their known current mass in the mentioned approximation .",
    "\\4 ) after the inclusion of the rest of the terms completing the full one loop contribution to the quark self - energy , an interesting outcome arises .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks , although showing high peak values of the propagator components near the former values of the squared proper masses , become confined .",
    "that is , their propagators do not show pole structures . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks acquire poles but now not at real values of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , these free modes are damped .",
    "these properties suggest a possibility for the explanation of the disparity of stability properties in the nucleons and higher resonances .",
    "it would work as follows , the absence of propagation solutions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks could assure the unlimited life time of nucleons .",
    "moreover , the damped oscillations present for the rest of the quarks can create decay modes for the bound states composed of them .",
    "\\5 ) by mean of the obtained mass values , the ground state energies selected within each of the groups hadron resonance reported in @xcite , were estimated through the simple addition of the masses of their known quark constituents .",
    "it could be remarked that the obtained values are reasonable ones in comparison with the data , after taking into account the high errors in the experimentally determined lagrangian masses .",
    "this fact supports the hypothesis about the main glue nature of the constituent mass values of the light quarks . the small contribution of the binding potential energy of such resonance to their total mass is also indicated and thus suggests the applicability of non relativistic approximations in their study .",
    "\\6 ) the contribution of the condensate to the gluon self - energy of order @xmath4 was calculated . a tachyonic result for",
    "the gluon mass arises for the parameter values employed in the construction of the initial state defined in @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is in concordance with the analysis of fukuda for gluon condensation @xcite .",
    "as it was remarked before , there are recent arguments claiming the possibility of a tachyonic gluon mass @xcite and its role in improving the quark antiquark potential in bound state models of mesons @xcite .",
    "\\a ) the feynman expansion depending on the condensate parameter and taken for the gauge parameter @xmath34 corresponds with the wick expansion around a physical state of the interaction free qcd . in this somewhat limited way",
    "the arbitrariness of the gauge parameter in the result for the gluon mass in @xcite was solved in @xcite . however , in order to furnish a fully consistent picture including renormalization , a physically equivalent version of the expansion for arbitrary values of @xmath52 should developed .",
    "this question will be addressed in future works .",
    "\\b ) in @xcite the condensation parameter @xmath5 was defined as a real and positive one .",
    "this result determined the tachyonic character for the gluon mass found here .",
    "further , the sign of @xmath5 also fixes the real values of the order of the one third of the nucleon mass for the constituent quark masses also calculated in the present work .",
    "the opposite sign produces confined quark modes .",
    "\\c ) an aspect which is important to underline is that the selection of the parameters defining the initial state in @xcite was designed also in order to impose the absence of a modification for the free ghost propagator .",
    "however , as it followed from the present analysis , this property in turns , is related with the fact that a condensate modification of the ghost propagator can produce a longitudinal contribution to the self - energy .",
    "but , such a term should not exist for the transversality condition of the polarization operator ( a ward identity ) to be obeyed .",
    "thus , its appearance could break manifestly the gauge invariance .",
    "therefore , the present work is also given foundation to the non - modified ghost propagator choice considered in @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) to search for a derivation of existing successful bounded state models for the heavy quark mesons @xcite , as realized by the a ladder approximation for the bethe - salpeter equation within the proposed modified expansion .",
    "the presence of a tachyonic gluon propagator in the approach ( which is argued to have the effect of introducing a linearly rising component in the inter - quark potential @xcite ) and the obtained constituent values for the light quark masses already support such a possibility .",
    "\\4 ) improve the study of the effective action as a functional of the condensate parameter done in @xcite by also including the gauge field in order to search for a variant of the leading logarithm model useful for the investigation of field configurations associated to inter - quark strings , nucleon - nucleon potentials , etc .",
    "\\5 ) it can be underlined that the considered expansion seems that could furnish a general way for the perturbative description of pair condensates in many body theory .",
    "an important example coming to the mind is the bcs state of the usual superconductivity .",
    "pair states being more closely connected with qcd were discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite it was advanced before the idea of using diquark condensates as generating an alternative for the higgs mechanism .",
    "finally , we would like to conjecture about a possibility suggested by the results of this work .",
    "it is related with the question about whether the mass spectrum of the whole three generations of fundamental fermions could be predicted by a slight generalization of the modified perturbation expansion under consideration . in this sense , the given arguments led us to the idea that ( after the introduction of quark condensates along the same lines as it was done for gluon ones in @xcite ) the received perturbation expansion can have the chance to predict both , the lagrangian mass and the constituent quark mass spectra of the three families of fundamental fermions .",
    "the fermion condensates as described in the proposed perturbative way , would have the role of producing the lagrangian quark masses , through the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the gluonic condensates , in one hand , and as illustrated here , could be responsible of generating states of large constituent mass for the low mass quarks states . in another hand",
    ", it seems feasible that the higher order radiative corrections ( including color interactions with the condensate as well as chiral symmetry corrections ) could also determine the mass spectra for leptons and neutrinos . the smaller scale for the masses of these particles",
    "could be produced by the lack of lower order either color or electric - weak interaction terms in their self - energy .",
    "therefore , the possibility that the lagrangian mass spectrum of the three generations of the fundamental fermions could be predicted by a modified perturbation expansion of the sort being proposed is suggested .",
    "work directed to investigate this possibility will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the modified expansion under study could be a useful technique of implementing this idea .",
