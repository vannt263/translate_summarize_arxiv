    "in recent years , there has been an increased interest in exploiting time series brightness variations of stars to infer fundamental stellar properties .",
    "this upsurge has been largely motivated by the transiting exoplanet survey missions , such as corot @xcite and _ kepler _",
    "@xcite , which have provided an avalanche of high signal - to - noise and high cadence photometry .",
    "in addition , such missions require accurate stellar characterization to infer the correct parameters for the associated transiting planet candidates .",
    "the strongest constraints on a star s fundamental parameters using time series photometry come from asteroseismology @xcite , the study of stellar oscillations .",
    "giants , sub - giants and bright dwarfs provide data on solar - like oscillations , and in these cases fundamental parameters may be determined to the percent level .",
    "another technique , known as gyrochronology , exploits a star s gradual angular momentum loss to date stars to @xmath6% accuracy using empirical calibrations from open clusters @xcite . here",
    ", the primary input is a stellar rotation period , which is revealed via rotational modulations in a photometric time series @xcite .",
    "recently , a new characterization technique has been proposed by @xcite ( b13 ) , which uses the variability over an 8-hour timescale , `` flicker '' , as a proxy for the surface gravity of a star , @xmath7 .",
    "flicker is able to reproduce @xmath8 to within @xmath9dex for fgk dwarfs and giants down to apparent magnitudes of 14 and is thought to be physically caused by stellar granulation on the star s",
    "surface @xcite . whilst asteroseismology undoubtedly provides tighter constraints on a star s basic parameters , the ability of flicker to infer @xmath8 for a much larger number of stars in a magnitude - limited survey , such as _ kepler _ , makes it highly appealing .",
    "in conjunction with these recent developments in stellar characterization , several authors have recently explored how an accurate determination of the mean stellar density , @xmath10 , plus a high quality transit light curve may be used to infer various properties of an exoplanet @xcite .",
    "asterodensity profiling ( ap ) compares the stellar density derived from the transit light curve shape @xcite , @xmath11 , to some independent measure , @xmath12 .",
    "relative differences can be caused by numerous phenomena , including orbital eccentricity and blend scenarios @xcite .",
    "whilst asteroseismology directly yields the mean stellar density for those targets with detected oscillations @xcite , flicker is currently only calibrated to surface gravity .    in this letter , we show that flicker is also able to determine the bulk density of a star to within @xmath13% across a wide range of spectral types and apparent magnitudes .",
    "this new empirical relation opens the door to conducting ap on many hundreds of transiting planet candidates detected by both _",
    "kepler _ and future missions .",
    "we describe our methodology for deriving this relation in  [ sec : method ] , followed by an exploration of the results in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we close in  [ sec : discussion ] by discussing the potential of this relation for ap with both previous and future missions .",
    "in order to investigate whether a relation exists between flicker and mean stellar density , we first require an accurate catalog of stellar densities .",
    "following b13 , we identify the sample of _ kepler _ targets for which asteroseismology oscillation modes have been detected as our `` gold standard '' catalog .",
    "these asteroseismology detections provide two immediate basic parameters : the average large frequency separation between consecutive overtones of the same spherical angular degree , @xmath14 , and the frequency of maximum oscillations power , @xmath15 .",
    "this latter term has been shown to be functionally dependent , to a good approximation , upon the surface gravity of the host star , @xmath7 , and the effective temperature , @xmath16 , @xcite via :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is sun s frequency of maximum oscillations power , @xmath19 is the sun s effective temperature and @xmath20 is the sun s surface gravity .",
    "the derived surface gravity is therefore moderately dependent upon some independent measure of the effective temperature .",
    "the other basic seismic observable , @xmath14 , scales with the star s mean stellar density @xcite as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the sun s mean density . in practice , this scaling is only approximate , and comparisons to individual model frequencies have shown temperature - dependent offsets of up to 2% in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath10 has a weaker functional dependence on the input effective temperature than @xmath7 and detailed seismic modeling allows for a refined measurement of @xmath10 at the percent level .",
    "for this reason , we consider that the seismic densities are the most accurate and precise parameter revealed by asteroseismology and so provide an ideal catalog for later calibration to flicker estimates .    in this work",
    ", we use the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite , which include 588 distinct _ kepler _ target stars . in the case of the catalog from @xcite , three different estimates of @xmath10",
    "are available , which vary very slightly due to different assumed effective temperatures and metallicities ( tables 4 , 5 & 6 ) . of these ,",
    "we preferentially employ table  6 values wherever available ( using high resolution spectroscopic stellar inputs from @xcite ) , then table  5 values ( irfm @xmath16 and field - average metallicity values ) and finally table  4 in all other cases ( using sdss - calibrated @xmath16 and field - average metallicity values ) . in the few cases where both @xcite and @xcite have independent measures",
    ", we use @xcite due to their use of dedicated spectroscopic inputs . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath10 uncertainties are also available , to provide the relevant weightings in the later regressions ( see  [ sub : deming ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , and further described in b13 , we measure the high - frequency stellar noise ( @xmath23 ) in the standard pipeline processed pdc - map ( data release 21 ) _ kepler _ long - cadence ( 30min ) light curves by calculating the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the difference between the light curve and a box - car smoothed version of itself . @xcite",
    "originally defined the high - frequency noise using a 4-point smoothing , however b13 found that a 16-point ( 8-hr ) smoothing yielded the cleanest correlation between the resultant @xmath23 and asteroseismically measured @xmath8 .",
    "large excursions in the light curve , caused , for example , by stellar flares , can artificially inflate the measured @xmath23 , resulting in erroneously low @xmath23-based @xmath8 .",
    "as such , we clip all @xmath24@xmath25 or greater outliers in the light curve prior to taking the rms . for stars with known transiting exoplanets , such as those in @xcite ,",
    "we additionally excise in - transit data points using the planetary orbital parameters publicly available through the nasa exoplanet archive @xcite .",
    "we then correct this derived @xmath23 for shot noise contributions as described in b13 .",
    "we compute @xmath23 for all available quarters of _ kepler _ data and adopt our final estimate and associated uncertainty as the mean and standard deviation of the results , respectively .",
    "we here describe how we compute the `` best - fitting '' model describing the dependent variable , @xmath10 , with respect to the independent variable , @xmath23 .",
    "we begin by noting that the correlation between these terms is close to linear using log - log scaling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : relation ] ) , similar to the case when b13 compared @xmath8 to @xmath23 . switching to",
    "log - log scaling requires an adjustment of the uncertainties in both variables .",
    "uncertainties are known for both the @xmath10 ( see  [ sub : seismicdata ] ) and @xmath23 ( see  [ sub : flickerdata ] ) measurements , which may be converted into @xmath26 space using the general rule :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is each variable and @xmath29 is the associated uncertainty .",
    "next , we consider that any model employed will itself be somewhat erroneous ; i.e. there are not only uncertainties on the observables , but also in the model itself .",
    "for example , this could be because other terms not considered here also impact the observed flicker .",
    "we adopt a simple method to treat the model uncertainty by introducing a quadrature error term in the dependent variable , @xmath30 , given by @xmath31 .",
    "this is similar to the way in which stellar `` jitter '' is often treated in radial velocity regressions @xcite and implicitly assumes that the model error does not vary with respect to the independent variable .",
    "although the fractional uncertainties on the @xmath32 measurements are typically much greater than those of @xmath33 , we seek a regression technique which accounts for the appropriate weighting in both observables .",
    "accordingly , our regression is performed in the least - squares framework , but specifically using the generalized @xcite method , which accounts for the uncertainties in both variables .",
    "we adopt a simple linear slope model given by equation  [ eqn : model ] , motivated by the visual correlation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : relation ] ) and the simplicity of this model makes it attractive for wider use in the community .",
    "@xmath34\\big ) = \\alpha + \\beta \\log_{10}\\big(f_8\\,[\\mathrm{ppm}]\\big ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to perform a deming regression , we must determine the co - ordinates of the point along the model curve , @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the dependent and independent variables respectively ) , which has the closest euclidean distance to each trial point , @xmath38 .",
    "this is achieved by minimizing the metric @xmath39 with respect to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the point along the curve @xmath35",
    "closest to the trial point @xmath38 , which for our linear slope model gives :    @xmath42    the least - squares merit function , which we numerically minimize with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , is simply the weighted euclidean distance between the observations and the model :    @xmath45    where in our specific case we have @xmath46\\big)$ ] , @xmath47\\big)$ ] , @xmath48)}^2 $ ] and @xmath49)}^2 +   \\sigma_{\\mathrm{model}}^2 $ ] .",
    "if we assume that the residuals of the dependent variable to the best - fitting model are approximately normally distributed , then one would expect , for a well - chosen @xmath31 , that the residuals divided by the respective uncertainties would be well described by the standard normal distribution .",
    "this can be checked by a subsequent least - squares regression of a normal distribution of zero mean but freely fitted variance to the distribution of the residuals . in practice , this is performed on the cumulative distribution of the residuals , rather than a probability density histogram , to avoid the choice of the bin - size affecting the results @xcite .",
    "in general , an arbitrary guess of @xmath31 will lead to a non - unity variance for this regressed normal distribution , but we iterate @xmath31 until this condition is satisfied in order to solve for the best @xmath31 .",
    "following the method described in  [ sub : deming ] , the best - fitting ( mean maximum likelihood ) model is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : relation ] .",
    "our simple linear model provides an excellent description of the apparent correlation and the associated parameters are available in table  [ tab : params ] . to compute this model",
    ", we enforced several criteria to exclude some of the less reliable data .",

    "range@xmath51ppm ( defined in b13 ) , since b13 find these points to be more frequently outliers .",
    "* @xmath52k to avoid the very cool or hot stars in our sample .",
    "* @xmath2 since correcting @xmath23 for _ kepler _ apparent magnitude is only calibrated up to this level ( b13 ) .",
    "note that the first criterion is equivalent to @xmath53 using the b13 relation , thus eliminating m & k dwarfs with insufficient photometric variability .",
    "these filters reduce the number of data points from 588 to 439 .",
    "the 439 `` good '' points are denoted by circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : relation ] and the ignored `` bad '' points are denoted by squares . using only the good points",
    ", we find the model error is 0.14dex ( 32% in @xmath10 ) . including all the data increases this to 0.15dex ( 35% in @xmath10 ) and the fitted parameters",
    "are provided in table  [ tab : params ] .",

    "[ fig : histo ] reveals that the residuals of the `` good '' sample appear approximately normally distributed .",
    "this means that if one knows the flicker of a star , one may construct an informative prior on @xmath54 using a normal distribution and the parameters provided in table  [ tab : params ] . for the sun",

    ". since the dependent variables have been changed and use different units , a fair comparison of their relative performance can not be conducted by inspection of the residuals in the dependent variables .",
    "instead , we invert the best - fitting model to predict @xmath23 as a function of the dependent variable and then compute the residuals in the @xmath23 measurements between the two models .",
    "we find that the @xmath10 model has a standard deviation in @xmath57)$ ] of @xmath58dex , versus @xmath59dex for the @xmath8 model .",
    "we also note that the pearson s correlation coefficient is @xmath60 for the @xmath10 model but @xmath61 for the @xmath8 model .",
    "we therefore conclude that surface gravity is a slightly better dependent variable to correlate against @xmath23 , although clearly @xmath10 does an excellent job too ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : relation ] ) .",
    "this weakly supports the hypothesis that flicker is most directly tracing surface features such as granulation @xcite , rather than internal processes . further support of this is found when we compare @xmath62 to @xmath23 , causing the correlation coefficient to drop to @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath10 relation is likely a good match simply due to the expected evolutionary correlation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath10 relation is more useful when analyzing exoplanet transits , since this term directly affects the light curve shape @xcite .",
    "asterodensity profiling ( ap ) has recently emerged as a valuable tool for characterizing exoplanets using time series photometry @xcite .",
    "ap exploits the fact that for a planet on a keplerian circular orbit transiting an unblended star with a symmetric intensity profile , the shape of the light curve reveals @xmath11 @xcite . if any of the idealized assumptions are invalid , then @xmath11 will differ from the true value , @xmath12 , and the direction and magnitude of the discrepancy reveals information about the transiting system @xcite . using independent @xmath10 estimates from asteroseismology , @xcite",
    "provide an example of the utility of ap by showing that the false positive rate of transiting planet candidates associated with giant stars is much higher than that of dwarf stars .    in this work",
    ", we have shown that flicker may also be used as an input for the independent measure of @xmath12 required for ap . despite uncertainties in @xmath10 increasing to @xmath13% from a flicker - based determination versus @xmath66% using asteroseismology , flicker can be used on many more targets in a magnitude - limited photometric survey like _ kepler _ , since it works reliably down to @xmath67 ( see later discussion in  [ sub : implications ] ) .",
    "we do not claim that the derived relation is the optimal choice of regressors or parametric form , merely that it provides a simple , empirical recipe for estimating @xmath10 .",
    "for example , including effective temperature may improve the relation , since cooler stars seem to be found at higher flicker values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : relation ] ) .",
    "however , including such terms would make our relation no longer purely photometric , which we would argue is the principal benefit of the flicker technique .    whilst we direct those interested to @xcite for details on the theory and range of effects which can cause ap discrepancies",
    ", we here provide an example calculation of the sensitivity of ap using flicker to detect eccentric exoplanets via the so - called `` photo - eccentric '' effect @xcite . for a planet on an eccentric orbit , the derived light curve stellar density will differ from the true value by @xcite :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the orbital eccentricity and @xmath70 is argument of periastron .",
    "@xcite show how to first order , constraints on @xmath69 scale with @xmath71 and thus even a weak prior on the density can lead to useful constraints on @xmath69 . with one observable and two unknowns , a unique solution to equation  [ eqn : psi ] is not possible .",
    "however , one can derive the minimum eccentricity , @xmath72 , of the planet and the associated uncertainty , @xmath73 , using equations  39&40 of @xcite respectively .",
    "let us assume that the uncertainty in @xmath74 is dominated by the denominator s error , which in turn was found using our flicker relation and equals 31.7% .",
    "we may now plot the term @xmath75 as a function of @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig : eminplot ] , to illustrate the ability of flicker to detect eccentric planets . using the classic @xcite test",
    ", we mark several key confidence levels with grid lines , demonstrating that flicker can detect eccentricities of @xmath76 to @xmath77@xmath25 confidence and @xmath78 to @xmath79@xmath25 . with the power of large number statistics , we anticipate that flicker will be particularly powerful for inferring the ensemble distribution of orbital eccentricities .     from a flicker - based measurement of 31.7% .",
    "several key confidence levels are marked with dashed grid lines for reference .",
    "_ , width=8 ]      between the two catalogs of @xcite and @xcite , there are 588 unique targets with asteroseismology detections yielding @xmath10 measurements with a median uncertainty of 4.1% . in contrast , there are @xmath80 _ kepler _ targets with @xmath2 , @xmath81k and @xmath82 ( nasa exoplanet archive ) . making the simple assumption that the same fraction of these targets will satisfy the range criterion defined earlier in  [ sub : fullresults ] , then we expect @xmath83 targets to be amenable for a flicker - based estimate of @xmath10 with a model accuracy of 31.7% .",
    "this translates to an increase in the number of ap targets by a factor of @xmath5 at the expense of an increase in the measurement uncertainty by a factor of @xmath4 . by any accounts ,",
    "this is an acceptable compromise and opens the door to conducting ap on hundreds of _ kepler _ planetary candidates ( we estimate @xmath84 ) .",
    "an alternative method to determine @xmath12 for targets without detectable oscillations would be via spectroscopy ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    ", one observes a spectrum of the target , compares it to a catalog of library spectra with various @xmath16 , @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath8 and then finally one finds the best matching stellar evolution isochrones to these basic parameters .",
    "this procedure has several drawbacks compared to a flicker - based determination though .",
    "firstly , this method requires that one obtain high snr spectra , whereas f8 can be measured from the data obtained directly from a photometric mission like _",
    "kepler_. secondly , the final determination of @xmath10 is strongly model dependent using both stellar evolution models and spectra template matching laden with challenging degeneracies .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the formal uncertainty on a spectroscopic determination of @xmath12 is typically no better than the flicker - based empirical relation for sun - like stars .",
    "for example , @xcite report @xmath86@xmath22 for the @xmath87 sun - like target koi-686 and our flicker technique yields @xmath88@xmath22 . in general then , we argue that for determinations of @xmath10 , the empirical and largely model independent flicker technique is preferable to spectroscopy , provided the target satisifies our sample criteria .    for the future tess mission @xcite , the smaller lens aperture of 12 cm will lead to higher photon noise than _ kepler _ , for the same target",
    "we therefore expect the 14@xmath89 magnitude cut - off of our flicker calibration to drop to @xmath90 .",
    "the same effect will lead to only very bright stars having asteroseismology detections though , with preliminary estimates suggesting @xmath91 asteroseismology targets out of @xmath92 target stars .",
    "in contrast , we expect that @xmath93 tess targets will be amenable to a flicker - based determination of their stellar densities ( with the exact number depending upon the as yet unknown target list ) .",
    "similarly , we expect flicker to have majorly benefit the upcoming plato 2.0 mission @xcite for both moderately bright targets near the edge of the field and faint targets in the center . since ap is not only a method for characterizing exoplanets but also for vetting them @xcite",
