    "many complex systems can be well described by networks where nodes present individuals or agents , and links denote the relations or interactions between nodes .",
    "complex network is therefore becoming an useful tool in analyzing a wide range of complex systems .",
    "recently , the understanding of structure , evolution and function of networks has attracted much attention from physics community @xcite .",
    "another important scientific issue relevant to network analysis , namely the _ information retrieval _",
    "@xcite , however , received less attention .",
    "originally , information retrieval aims at finding material of an unstructured nature that satisfies an information need from large collections @xcite .",
    "it can be also viewed as dealing with prediction of links between words and documents , and is now further extended to standing for a number of problems on link mining @xcite .",
    "actually , link prediction problem is a long - standing challenge in modern information science , and a lot of algorithms have been proposed based on markov chains and machine learning processes by computer science community @xcite .",
    "however , their works have not caught up the current progress of the study of complex networks , especially they lack serious consideration of the structural characteristics of networks which may indeed provide useful information and insights for link prediction .",
    "the problem of link prediction aims at estimating the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes , based on observed links and the attributes of nodes .",
    "it can be categorized into two classes : one is the prediction of missing links in sampling networks , such as the food webs and the world wide webs ; the other is the prediction of links that may exist in the future of evolving networks , like the on - line social networks .",
    "in addition , the link prediction algorithms ( or other algorithms based on similar techniques ) can also be applied to solve the link classification problem in partially labeled networks @xcite , such as the prediction of protein functions @xcite and to distinguish the research areas of scientific publications @xcite .    up to now ,",
    "most of the algorithms are designed according to the definition of node similarity .",
    "node similarity can be defined just using the essential attributes of nodes , namely two nodes are considered to be similar if they have many common features @xcite .",
    "another group of similarity indices is based solely on the network structure , which is called structural similarity and can be further classified as node - dependent , path - dependent and mixed methods .",
    "an introduction and comparison of some similarity indices is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the _ common neighbors _ @xcite , _ jaccard coefficient _",
    "@xcite , _ adamic - adar index _ @xcite and _ preferential attachment _",
    "@xcite are classified to be the node - dependent indices , while _",
    "katz index _ @xcite , _ hitting time _",
    "@xcite , _ commute time _",
    "@xcite , _ rooted pagerank _",
    "@xcite , _ simrank _ @xcite and _ blondel index _",
    "@xcite are classified to be the path - dependent indices . besides , leicht , holme and newman proposed a measure to quantify the node similarity based on the assumption that two nodes are similar if their immediate neighbors in the network are themselves similar @xcite .",
    "this leads to a self - consistent matrix formulation of similarity that can be evaluated iteratively using the adjacency matrix .",
    "this similarity index can also be considered as a candidate for accurate link prediction .    besides the similarity - based prediction algorithms , some more complicated methods are proposed recently .",
    "clauset , moore and newman proposed an algorithm based on the hierarchical network structure @xcite .",
    "firstly , they use a hierarchical random graph to statistically fit the real network data .",
    "then the dependence of the lateral - connection probability on the depth of the nodes in the hierarchy can be inferred .",
    "finally , one can predict the missing links of the network according to the lateral - connecting probability by ranking them in the descending order . furthermore , many efforts have been done for designing the recommender systems @xcite .",
    "actually , the process of recommending items to a user can be considered as the prediction of missing links in the user - item bipartite network @xcite . especially , physicists have recently proposed some information recommendation algorithms based on physical processes , such as energy diffusion @xcite and heat conduction @xcite .",
    "although the relevant issue has not been fully explored , it highlights a possibility to improve the accuracy and efficiency of link prediction algorithms by applying classical physics dynamics .",
    "there are many difficulties for the studies of link prediction .",
    "one is the sparsity of the target networks @xcite , which leads to a serious problem that the prior probability of a link is typically quite small , resulting in large difficulties in building statistical models .",
    "the other problem is the huge size of real systems that requires highly efficient algorithms .",
    "however , the complexity of computational time and memory , being a crucial factor in real applications , has not been systematically investigated . generally speaking ,",
    "the accuracy of an algorithm and its computational complexity have positive correlation , namely higher accuracy usually implies higher complexity .",
    "note that , any highly accurate algorithm will become meaningless if the consuming time or memory is unacceptable .",
    "therefore , designing an accurate and fast algorithm is a big challenge , especially for sparse and huge networks .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a so - called _ local path index _ to characterize the node similarity .",
    "extensive numerical simulations on both modeled networks and real networks demonstrate that this similarity index is simultaneously highly effective ( its prediction accuracy is much higher than the _",
    "common neighbors _ , and competitive with the katz index ) and highly efficient ( the time and space required to compute it are much less than those for the katz index ) .",
    "especially , when the network is huge , the local path index shows great advantage compared with the katz index since computing the latter asks for a cpu time scaling as cube of the network size while computing the former requires a linear cpu time as the network size .",
    "we therefore think this local path index is a strong candidate for potential practical applications in data mining of huge - size complex networks .",
    "considering an unweighted undirected simple network @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of nodes and @xmath2 is the set of links .",
    "the multiple links and self - connections are not allowed . for each pair of nodes , @xmath3 ,",
    "we assign a score , @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath5 is undirected , the score is supposed to be symmetry , say @xmath6 .",
    "all the nonexistent links are sorted in decreasing order according to their scores , and the links in the top are most likely to exist . in this paper , we adopt the simplest framework , that is , to directly set the similarity as the score , so the higher score means the higher similarity , and vice versa . in some link prediction algorithms ,",
    "the scores may be not directly related to a certain similarity measurement , but describe the existence likelihood of links @xcite , and in some other algorithms , scores may be generated by an integration of some similarities of node pairs in the neighborhood of the target links , such as the collaborative filtering method @xcite .    , and",
    "the degree , @xmath7 , are fixed .",
    "each data point is obtained by averaging over 10 independent realizations . when approaching the purely random case , @xmath8 , the accuracies of cn and lp go below 0.5 , which is an artifact of the specific constrain on identical degree .",
    "that is , in the purely random case , two unconnected nodes with higher degrees in the training set are of less probability to be connected in the probe set since the total degree is identical for every node , however , they generally have more common neighbors and thus higher similarity.,width=264 ]    , and the strength of randomness , @xmath9 , are fixed .",
    "each data point is obtained by averaging over 10 independent realizations.,width=264 ]    in this paper , we compare the prediction accuracies and computational complexity of three similarity indices : _ common neighbors _",
    "( cn ) , _ katz index _ and a newly proposed similarity index , namely _ local path index _ ( lp index or lp for short ) . their definitions and relevant motivations are introduced as follows :    ( i)_common neighbors _ , which is also called _ structural equivalence _ in ref . @xcite . in common sense , two nodes ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 , are more likely to form a link in the future if they have many common neighbors . for a node @xmath10 ,",
    "let @xmath12 denote the set of neighbors of @xmath10 .",
    "the simplest measure of the neighborhood overlap is the directed count : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cardinality of the set @xmath15 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the adjacency matrix , in which @xmath18 if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are directly connected and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "note that , @xmath20 is also the number of different paths with length 2 connecting @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "newman @xcite used this quantity in the study of collaboration networks , showing the correlation between the number of common neighbors and the probability that two scientists will collaborate in the future . some more complicated measures , such as _ salton index _",
    "@xcite , _ jaccard index _",
    "@xcite , _ srensen index _ @xcite and _ adamic - adar index _",
    "@xcite , can also be categorized into cn - based measures .",
    "however , recently , extensive empirical analysis has demonstrated that the simplest cn ( i.e. , eq . ( 1 ) ) performs even better than those complicated variants @xcite .",
    "therefore , we here select cn as the representative of all cn - based measures .",
    "although cn consumes little time and performs relatively good among many local indices , due to the insufficient information , its accuracy ca nt catch up with the measures based on global information .",
    "one typical example is the _",
    "katz index _ @xcite .",
    "katz index_. this measure is based on the ensemble of all paths , which directly sums over the collection of paths and exponentially damped by length to give the short paths more weights .",
    "the mathematical expression reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the set of all paths with length @xmath23 connecting @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath24 is a free parameter controlling the weights of the paths .",
    "obviously , a very small @xmath24 yields a measure close to cn , because the long paths contribute very little .",
    "the @xmath25 matrix can be written as @xmath26 .",
    "note that , @xmath24 must be lower than the reciprocal of the maximum of the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath17 to ensure the convergence of eq .",
    "( iii)_local path index_. to provide a good tradeoff of accuracy and complexity , we here introduce an index that takes consideration of local paths , with wider horizon than cn .",
    "it is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath25 denotes the similarity matrix and @xmath28 is a free parameter .",
    "clearly , this measure degenerates to cn when @xmath29 . and",
    "if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not directly connected ( this is the case we are interested in ) , @xmath30 is equal to the number of different paths with length 3 connecting @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "although it needs more information than cn , it is still a local measure of relatively lower complexity than global ones .",
    "choosing these three indices for comparison is because they all can be classified to path - dependent similarities with unified form as @xmath31 , where for cn , @xmath32 ; for lp , @xmath33 ; and for katz , @xmath34 .",
    "since we are only interested in the indirectly connected node pairs , katz index can be treated as a measure considering @xmath35 .",
    "note that , all these three indices are used to quantify the structural equivalence , with an latent assumption that the link itself indicated a similarity between two endpoints ( see , for example , the leicht - holme - newman index @xcite and transferring similarity @xcite ) .",
    "an issue worth future exploration is whether a certain similarity measure on _ regular equivalence _ ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the mathematical definition of regular equivalence and ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent application on the prediction of protein functions ) can provide better predictions .        to test the algorithmic accuracy , the observed links , @xmath2 ,",
    "is randomly divided into two parts : the training set , @xmath36 , is treated as known information , while the probe set , @xmath37 , is used for testing and no information in the probe set is allowed to be used for prediction . clearly , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in this paper",
    ", the training set always contains 90% of links , and the remaining 10% of links constitute the probe set .",
    "we use a standard metric , _ area under the receiver operating characteristic _ ( roc ) curve @xcite , to quantify the accuracy of prediction algorithms . in the present case",
    ", this metric can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen missing link ( a link in @xmath37 ) is given a higher score than a randomly chosen nonexistent link ( a link in @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the universal set ) . in the implementation , among @xmath42 times of independent comparisons ,",
    "if there are @xmath43 times the missing link having higher score and @xmath44 times the missing link and nonexistent link having the same score , we define the _ accuracy _ as @xmath45 .",
    "if all the scores are generated from an independent and identical distribution , the accuracy should be about 0.5 .",
    "therefore , the degree to which the accuracy exceeds 0.5 indicates how much better the algorithm performs than pure chance .",
    "readers are encouraged to see the refs .",
    "@xcite for more information about how to evaluate the accuracy of prediction algorithms .",
    "in this section , we compare the three similarity indices in modeled networks with controllable density and randomness . although the real networks have complex structural properties @xcite , such as the community structure , the mixing pattern and the rich - club phenomenon , as a start point , we only consider a very simple model , and to eliminate the effect of degree heterogeneity , we assume that every node has an identical degree , @xmath46 . in this model , each node is characterized by a 10-dimensional vector with each element a randomly selected real number in the interval @xmath47 .",
    "this vector represents the node s intrinsic features , such as the attributes of an object and the profiles of a person .",
    "two nodes are considered to be similar and thus of high probability to connect to each other if they share many close attributes .",
    "therefore , we define the _ intrinsic similarity _ between two nodes as the scalar product of the corresponding vectors , namely @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the vector of node @xmath10 , and the superscript emphasizes that this similarity is intrinsic and can not be observed in the real systems .",
    "given the network size , @xmath50 , and the degree of each node , @xmath46 , this model starts with an empty network but @xmath50 nodes , that is , each node is of degree zero . at each time step",
    ", a node with the smallest degree is randomly selected ( generally , there are more than one node having the smallest degree ) . among all other nodes whose degrees are smaller than @xmath46 , this selected node will connect to the most similar node with probability @xmath51 , while a randomly chosen one with probability @xmath52 .",
    "this process will terminate when all nodes are of degree @xmath46 .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 $ ] represents the strength of randomness in generating links , which can be understood as noise or irrationality that exists in almost every real system .    , and the strength of randomness , @xmath9 , are fixed .",
    "each data point is obtained by averaging over 10 independent realizations .",
    "all computations were carried out in a desktop computer with a single intel ( r ) xeon ( tm ) processor ( 3.00 ghz ) and 2 gb ems memory.,width=264 ]    , and the strength of randomness , @xmath9 , are fixed .",
    "each data point is obtained by averaging over 10 independent realizations .",
    "the hardware environment is the same as what we stated in the caption of figure 4.,width=264 ]    in fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , we report the comparison of algorithmic accuracy for those three similarity indices .",
    "data points are corresponding to the optimal values of @xmath24 ( for katz index ) or @xmath28 ( for lp index ) subject to the highest accuracies .",
    "clearly , both katz index and lp index perform remarkable better than the simple cn index . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , when the strength of randomness / noise is weak , lp index gives competitive result as katz index , while for highly noisy cases , lp index performs even better .",
    "whatever the similarity index , a link prediction algorithm is expected to give higher accuracy for a denser network , which is in accordance with what observed in fig .",
    "2 . in the area with lacking information ( i.e. , small @xmath46 ) or rich information ( i.e. , large @xmath46 ) ,",
    "lp index performs slightly better than cn index , while in the middle with typical degree as the real networks , lp index can perform much better than the cn index .",
    "the reason why the cn index performs remarkably poorer than lp index is that the probability that two node pairs are assigned the same similarity by cn is high . that is to say , cn index is less distinguishable , especially in the relatively sparse networks .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath7 , there are about @xmath56 node pairs , 94.01% of which are assigned zero score , and for all non - zero scores , 79.87% are @xmath57 . as shown later",
    ", the real cases may be even worse , for instance , in a router - level internet with 5022 nodes , 99.59% of node pairs are assigned zero score by cn , while for all those non - zero scores , 91.11% of which are assigned score one .",
    "the additional information involving the next nearest neighbors introduced by lp index can make the similarities much more distinguishable , thus remarkably enhance the accuracy .",
    "note that , if the maximal number of paths with length three connecting two arbitrary nodes is @xmath58 , any @xmath28 in the interval @xmath59 will give out exactly the same predictions .",
    "therefore , the prediction accuracy for lp index is not sensitive to the parameter @xmath28 when @xmath28 is not so large . indeed , setting @xmath28 as a small positive number like @xmath60 one can obtain a near optimal accuracy , usually less than @xmath61 smaller than the real optimum ( see also table ii , where we compare the optimal auc values with the values obtained by setting @xmath62 for the six real networks ) . in finding the optimal value of @xmath24 , one can first calculate the maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , and the optimal @xmath24 is always smaller than its reciprocal .",
    "it is then easy to approach the optimal @xmath24 .",
    "for example , the optimal values of @xmath24 for relevant data points shown in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 are all no larger than 0.03 .    next ,",
    "we discuss the computational complexities of the three similarity indices . in calculating the cn index , for each node , denoted by @xmath10 , we first search all @xmath10 s neighbors ( called the step 1 ) , and then lay out the neighbors of each of @xmath10 s neighbors , respectively ( called the step 2 ) . if a node @xmath11 appears @xmath42 times in the step 2 , @xmath63 .",
    "since the time complexity to traverse the neighborhood of a node is simply @xmath46 , the time complexity in calculating cn index is @xmath64 .",
    "analogously , for lp index , what we need to do is go one step further ( called the step 3 ) to check all neighbors of each of @xmath10 s second - order neighbors , respectively . if a node @xmath11 appears @xmath42 times in @xmath10 s second - order neighborhood and @xmath65 times in @xmath10 s third - order neighborhood , @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the time complexity in calculating the lp index is @xmath67 .",
    "an detailed illustration for an example network consisted of four nodes is shown in fig .",
    "[ time ] . for the katz index ,",
    "the time complexity is mainly determined by the matrix inversion operator , which is @xmath68 @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 and fig . 5 , we report the numerical results about computational complexity of the three similarity indices , which are well in accordance with the analysis . beside the time complexity ,",
    "memory space is another limitation for algorithmic implementation for huge - size networks . in calculating cn and lp indices , the memory required are of the order @xmath69 , while for the katz index , it is of the order @xmath70 . in a word , compared with the widely applied cn index and katz index ,",
    "the lp index is not only highly effective ( i.e. , accurate ) , but also highly efficient ( i.e. , required relatively less memory and cpu time ) .",
    "in this paper , we consider six representative networks drawn from disparate fields : ( i ) ppi. a protein - protein interaction network containing 2617 proteins and 11855 interactions @xcite .",
    "although this network is not connected ( it contains 92 components ) , most of nodes belong to the giant component , whose size is 2375 .",
    "( ii ) ns. a network of coauthorships between scientists who are themselves publishing on the topic of networks @xcite .",
    "this network contains 1589 scientists , and 128 of which are isolated .",
    "here we do not consider those isolated nodes .",
    "the connectivity of ns is not good .",
    "it is consisted of 268 connected components , and the size of the largest connected component is only 379 .",
    "( iii ) grid. an electrical power grid of western us @xcite , with nodes representing generators , transformers and substations , and links corresponding to the high voltage transmission lines between them .",
    "this network contains 4941 nodes and is well connected .",
    "( iv ) pb. a network of the us political blogs @xcite .",
    "the original links are directed , here we treat them as undirected ones .",
    "pb has 1224 nodes and the giant component contains 1222 nodes .",
    "( v ) int. the router - level topology of the internet , which is collected by the _ rocketfuel project _ @xcite .",

    "( vi ) usair. the network of us air transportation system , which contains 332 airports and 2126 airlines @xcite .",
    "note that , all the similarity indices considered here , as well as those well - known indices ( except the preferential attachment index ) reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , will give zero score to a pair of nodes located in two disconnected components .",
    "therefore , here we only consider the giant component , and when preparing the probe set , we also make sure that the remain training set representing a connected network .",
    "actually , each time before removing of a link to the probe set , we first check if this removal will make the training network disconnected .",
    "table 1 summarizes the basic topological features of the giant component of those networks .",

    "we further use six representative real networks to test the three similarity indices , showing that the lp index can provide competitively accurate predictions as the katz index . compared with the katz index ,",
    "the lp index requires much less cpu time and memory space , and is therefore more practical .",
    "ignored the degree - degree correlation , the time complexities in calculating lp index and katz index are @xmath90 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "hence for the huge ( i.e. , very large @xmath50 ) and sparse ( i.e. , very small average degree @xmath72 ) networks , the advantage of the lp index is striking .",
    "highly accurate predictions are significant in practice .",
    "for example , many biological networks , such as protein - protein interaction networks , metabolic networks and food webs , the discovery of links / interactions costs much in the laboratory or the field . instead of blindly checking all possible interactions , to predict in advance based on the interactions known already and",
    "focus on those links most likely to exist can sharply reduce the experimental costs if the predictions are accurate enough @xcite .",
    "for some others like the friendship networks in web society , very likely but not yet existent links can be suggested to the relevant users as recommendations of promising friendships .",
    "these recommendations can help users finding new friends and thus enhance their loyalties to the web sites . besides the practical significance , it is worthwhile to emphasize that the study of link prediction can also provide some theoretical insights about the structural organization .",
    "for example , in this paper , the unexpected results on grid and usair give evidence to some specific structural properties that are not straightforwardly notable .",
    "another example is that the preferential attachment index usually gives poor predictions , and when it works relatively good , it implies that the testing network has strong rich - club phenomenon @xcite .",
    "although the focus of this paper is not to investigate the relations between suitable similarity indices and network structures , we believe it is an interesting issue worth further studies .    in this paper , we only considered the link prediction problem in static networks .",
    "however , many real networks are evolving all the time , and the links created in different times should be assigned different weights in principle . this time - involved link prediction problem is rarely investigated and of course worths a serious study in the future @xcite .",
    "most of previous studies in relevant direction only test the algorithmic accuracy in real networks . here",
    "we argue that the modeled networks should be used , because one can control some meaningful parameters in a model , which can not be directly observed in the real networks ( e.g. , the strength of noise or irrationality ) .",
    "we hope the proposed model could become a prototype in testing the accuracy of link prediction algorithms , however , it is currently too simple and to make it closer to the real networks , such as introducing controllable degree heterogeneity and degree - degree correlation , is very helpful .",
    "this paper concerns only the simple networks , however , the local path index can be easily extended to more complicated cases .",
    "for example , we can handle the directed networks by replacing the original adjacency matrix , @xmath17 , by an asymmetry one , the weighted networks by replacing @xmath17 by a weighted matrix , and the networks with self connections by assigning nonzero diagonal elements .",
    "actually , murate and moriyasu @xcite have already investigated the link prediction problem in weighted networks , however , the credibility of their work is recently challenged by the empirical evidence that the weak ties may play a more important role in link prediction than the strong ties @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge valuable discussion with yi - cheng zhang .",
    "this work is partially supported by the swiss national science foundation ( project 205120 - 113842 ) .",
    "acknowledges the future and emerging technologies programmes of the european commission fp7-cosi - ict ( project qlectives , grant no .",
    "t.z . acknowledges the national natural science foundation of china ( grant nos .",
    "10635040 and 60744003 ) .",
    "a straightforward method to extend the local path index is to consider the higher - order paths .",
    "such a similarity index is of the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the maximal order . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the computational complexity in an uncorrelated network is @xmath93 , which grows fast with the increasing of @xmath42 and will exceed the complexity for calculating the katz index for large @xmath42 .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the case of @xmath89 , equivalent to the one shown in eq .",
    "as shown in table iv , the improvements of accuracy are not much except for the power grid .",
    "sometimes , to introduce higher - order relations will even decrease the accuracy , like for usair and pb .",
    "the results are very sensitive to the average shortest distances of networks .",
    "if @xmath73 is very short , to consider paths with length three seems enough , and the addition item , @xmath94 , will make little effort ( e.g. , ppi , ns and int ) or even negative effort ( e.g. , usair and pb ) .",
    "only when the network is of long average shortest distance , to consider higher - order relations may be cost - effective .",
    "since most real networks exhibit strongly small - world effect @xcite , a local path index taking into account paths with length no more than three may be practically sufficient .",
