    "deconvolution is a challenging inverse problem that is ubiquitous in applications of signal processing , control theory and wireless communications like blind image restoration  @xcite , blind system identification  @xcite and , blind channel estimation and equalization  @xcite . in the absence of additional constraints ,",
    "blind deconvolution is known to be ill - posed and each application mentioned above imposes some form of prior knowledge on the underlying signal structures to render the inverse problem better behaved .",
    "_ sparsity _ based models have been used extensively in the past decade to capture hidden signal structures in many applications of interest .",
    "prominent examples of the exploitation of sparsity include natural images admitting sparse wavelet domain representations  @xcite , ultra wide band communication channels exhibiting sparsity in doppler - delay domain representations  @xcite , and user preferences and topic models displaying low - rank structures  @xcite ( sparsity in eigenvalue domain ) . while there have been a few attempts at exploiting sparsity priors for blind deconvolution and related problems  @xcite , there does not appear to be a general characterization of _ identifiability _ of such sparse models , except with very restrictive constraints .",
    "for example , @xcite assumes a _ single random subspace _ signal model as opposed to the more commonly used _ union of subspaces _ signal model in compressed sensing  @xcite . in this two - part paper , we prove some surprising negative results for signal identifiability in the non - sparse and sparsity constrained blind deconvolution problems , even for the single subspace model . for a principled approach to studying these negative results , the first part of the paper develops a measure theoretically tight characterization of the ambiguity space of blind deconvolution . because of the simplicity of the linear convolution map , its ( non - linear ) kernel can be partially parametrized to yield an analytically useful representation that is instrumental in the derivation of our results . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is a novel parameterization that has not appeared elsewhere in literature .",
    "the second part  @xcite of this paper shows that the unfavorable sparsity - ambiguity trade - off results on identifiability are a consequence of the kernel of the linear convolution map being of large dimension ( of the order of the signal dimension ) .",
    "we present some constructive numerical examples illustrating the nature and source of unidentifiability for blind linear deconvolution .",
    "the discrete - time blind linear deconvolution problem can be stated as the task of recovering ( up to scalar multiplicative ambiguities ) the unknown signal pair @xmath0 from the observation of their noise free linear convolution @xmath1 .",
    "it is intuitive to see that if there exists another pair @xmath2 such that @xmath3 but @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not collinear then @xmath6 is _ unidentifiable _ ( information theoretically impossible to recover uniquely ) .",
    "below , we illustrate what can go wrong with blind deconvolution for @xmath7 ( beside scalar multiplicative ambiguities ) .",
    "consider the vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 assigned as    @xmath10    clearly , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are linearly independent and a simple calculation reveals that @xmath13 implying unidentifiability of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 within @xmath7 .",
    "a more non - trivial numerical example can be constructed using the vectors @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( which are functions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 above ) , defined as @twocolumn    [ eqn : numerical example cos sin ] @xmath22    [ eqn : numerical example cos sin ] @xmath23    clearly , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are linearly independent and we observe that @twocolumn @xmath24 @xmath25 implying unidentifiability of both pairs @xmath26 and @xmath27 within @xmath7 .     and @xmath28 in the figure , @xmath29 implies @xmath30 for any @xmath31 . ]",
    "the construction used in illustrates a form of _ rotational ambiguity _ that generalizes to produce a family of unidentifiable pairs in @xmath32 .",
    "[ fig : rotation ambiguity ] represents a pictorial depiction of the following construction .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the common convolved output in .",
    "consider the parameterized vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 defined by    [ eqn : rotational transform ] @xmath36    where @xmath31 are the parameters , and @xmath37 acts as the set of seed vectors driving the above transformation .",
    "clearly , linear independence of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath31 imply that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are linearly independent .",
    "simple algebraic manipulations reveal that @twocolumn    [ eqn : parametrized example cos sin ] @xmath40    [ eqn : parametrized example cos sin ] @xmath41    since and have the same , both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unidentifiable within @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath44 describes a two dimensional parameter space , implies that the unidentifiable subset of @xmath32 is at least two dimensional .",
    "notice that the aforementioned construction for unidentifiable signal pairs (  the rotational ambiguity ) remains true , even if the domain of the vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 is restricted to an annulus @xmath45 for some @xmath46 .",
    "prior research on blind system and channel identification  @xcite has mainly focused on single - in - multiple - out ( simo ) and multiple - in - multiple - out ( mimo ) systems , also known as the _ blind multi - channel finite - impulse - response ( fir ) estimation _ problem .",
    "these systems have multiple output channels that need to be estimated from the observed outputs when the channels are driven by either a single source ( simo system ) or multiple sources ( mimo system ) .",
    "a key property necessary for successful identifiability and recovery of the multiple channel vectors is that the channels should display sufficient diversity or richness either stochastically ( cyclostationary second order statistics )  @xcite or deterministically ( no common zero across all channels )  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , such diversity is generally unavailable in the single - in - single - out ( siso ) systems thus making them extremely challenging .",
    "however , siso systems are our primary concern due to their equivalence to blind deconvolution problems . in this paper",
    ", we shall _ not _ be concerned with stochastic formulations where multiple realizations of the channel are observed to infer empirical statistics .",
    "instead , we shall consider non - sparse ( here , in  i ) and sparse ( in  ii ) channel instances and characterize their instance identifiabilities .",
    "when blind deconvolution is treated as a channel estimation problem , @xcite shows that guard intervals of sufficient length between blocks of transmitted symbols enable successful blind channel identification , even for the deterministic siso system type .",
    "more specifically , for an @xmath47 length channel impulse response ( cir ) a guard interval of length @xmath48 is needed between consecutive blocks of transmitted source symbols , resulting in an absence of any inter - block or inter - symbol interference ( isi ) in the convolved output of the channel .",
    "we consider scenarios involving isi and show unidentifiability  a wide variety of domain restrictions .",
    "although our definition of identifiability is similar to that in  @xcite , our results are substantially different in nature .",
    "firstly , we deal with real fields ( not algebraically closed ) and with sparse subsets of real vector spaces ( induced by measures that are not absolutely continuous  the lebesgue measure ) as opposed to the algebraically closed complex fields and vector spaces considered in @xcite .",
    "this requires different proof techniques .",
    "secondly , we focus on unidentifiability results and characterize the dimension of the unidentifiable subsets in addition to showing existence results .",
    "furthermore , our proofs constructively show unidentifiable subsets as opposed to non - constructive existence proofs .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", blind deconvolution was cast as a rank one matrix recovery problem first in  @xcite ; we adopted this framework in our earlier works  @xcite on characterization of identifiability in general bilinear inverse problems .",
    "herein , we specifically consider the blind deconvolution problem and characterize its inherent _ unidentifiability _ under some application - motivated sparsity and subspace constraints .",
    "further ,  @xcite focused on developing heuristic algorithms for the deconvolution problem and did not explicitly address identifiability .",
    "the subsequent paper  @xcite , by the authors of @xcite , does ( implicitly ) address identifiability ( through a study of recoverability by convex programming ) but assumes the knowledge of the support of the sparse signal .",
    "although blind deconvolution is an instance of a bilinear inverse problem , the present work differs significantly from our earlier work  @xcite in two ways .",
    "firstly , @xcite focused on identifiability results ( analogous to achievability results in information theory ) whereas the present paper derives unidentifiability results ( akin to converse / impossibility results in information theory ) .",
    "secondly ,  ii of this paper  @xcite explores more explicit sparsity priors motivated by applications like cooperative communication  @xcite , channel estimation for wide - band communication  @xcite and musical source separation  @xcite , whereas @xcite developed the theory of regularized bilinear inverse problems more abstractly , making assumptions no more specific than non - convex cone constrained priors .",
    "a consequence of focusing specifically on blind deconvolution is that we are able to develop tight converse bounds that match our achievability bounds in  @xcite .",
    "the tractability of this analysis hinges on the structural simplicity of the convolution operator after lifting .    to rigorously justify the dimension related results in both parts of the paper , we call upon the theoretical framework of the _ hausdorff dimension _ of sets in metric spaces . a moderately detailed introduction to the topic can be found in  @xcite . for the sake of readability",
    ", we provide a short review of the concept and some of the useful properties in  ii ,  ii - c of the paper .      in this work , we quantify unidentifiability for certain families of noiseless sparse and non - sparse blind deconvolution problems under a _ non - asymptotic _ and _ non - statistical _ setup .",
    "specifically , given model orders @xmath49 ,  i of the paper develops a parameterization of the ambiguity kernel for blind linear deconvolution and shows that almost every input @xmath50 is unidentifiable under blind deconvolution in the absence of further constraints .",
    "furthermore , the characterization developed herein is used in  ii of the paper to investigate some application driven choices of the separable domain restriction @xmath51 and establish that these restrictions are insufficient to guarantee identifiability of the vectors @xmath5 and @xmath52 from their linearly convolved resultant vector @xmath53 .",
    "our approach leads to the following novelties for  i ( refer to  @xcite for contributions of  ii of the paper ) .    1 .",
    "we are able to analyze unidentifiability in blind deconvolution by studying the rank constrained null space of a linear operator on matrices .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate the almost everywhere unidentifiable nature of unconstrained blind deconvolution by constructing families of adversarial signal pairs for even model orders @xmath54 and @xmath47 .",
    "this is a much stronger unidentifiability result than any counterparts in the literature .",
    "we state and prove a measure theoretically tight , non - linear , partially parametric and partially recursive characterization of the rank two null space of the lifted linear convolution map . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is a new result .",
    "characterizing the rank two null space is useful for a variety of applications , including the study of scaling laws in bilinear inverse problems  @xcite .",
    "our proofs are constructive and demonstrate a rotational ambiguity phenomenon in general bilinear inverse problems which is the cause of existence of a large dimensional set of unidentifiable input pairs in blind deconvolution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : model ] describes the system model , sets up the notion of identifiability up to a suitably defined equivalence class , and presents the lifted reformulation of the blind deconvolution problem as a rank one matrix recovery problem .",

    "all vectors are assumed to be column vectors unless stated otherwise .",
    "we shall use lowercase boldface alphabets to denote column vectors  (  @xmath55 ) and uppercase boldface alphabets to denote matrices  (  @xmath56 ) .",

    ", we denote its column space by @xmath67 .",
    "the standard euclidean inner product on a vector space will be denoted by @xmath68 and the underlying vector space will be clear from the usage context .    when we refer to the ` dimension ' of a set , we shall mean the hausdorff dimension of the set . to avoid unnecessarily heavy notation",
    ", we shall adopt the following convention : the use of both vector variables ( like @xmath4 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , ) as well as matrix variables ( like @xmath72 , @xmath73 , ) is allowed to differ across theorems and proofs ( and even across different subparts of the same proof ) with the understanding that their meanings are restricted to the scope of the individual theorems ( and proofs ) .",
    "this facilitates the reuse of the same variable names across different theorems with distinct meanings without confusion .",
    "we shall consider the noiseless linear convolution system model @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the pair of unknown signals with a given domain restriction @xmath76 , @xmath77 denotes the linear convolution map , and @xmath78 is the vector of observations given by @xmath79 we are interested in solving for the vectors @xmath4 and @xmath69 from the noiseless observation @xmath80 in  .",

    "we assume that the lengths ( or model orders ) @xmath54 and @xmath47 , respectively , of vectors @xmath4 and @xmath69 are fixed and known _ a priori_. notice that the deconvolution problem   has an inherent scaling ambiguity due to the identity @xmath81 stemming from the bi - linearity of the convolution operator .",
    "thus , any meaningful definition of identifiability for blind deconvolution must disregard this type of scaling ambiguity .",
    "this leads us to the following definition of identifiability .",

    "it is easy to see that  [ defn : identifiability ] induces an equivalence structure on the set of identifiable pairs in @xmath32 , and identifiability refers to the identification of the equivalence class in @xmath32 that generated the observation @xmath80 in .      while   is an accurate representation of a blind deconvolution problem , it is not easily amenable to an identifiability analysis in the sense of  [ defn : identifiability ] .",
    "we use the _ lifting _ technique from optimization  @xcite to rewrite   as a rank minimization problem subject to linear equality constraints  @xcite ; a form that is better suited for an identifiability analysis , where @xmath88 is _ any _ set satisfying @xmath89 and @xmath90 is a linear operator which can be deterministically constructed from the linear convolution map .",
