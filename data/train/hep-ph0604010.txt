    "the understanding of few - body systems relies in our capability to design methods for finding an exact or approximate solution of the @xmath0body problem . in two- , three- , and four - body problems it is possible to obtain mathematically correct and computationally tractable equations such as the lippmann - schwinger , faddeev and yakubovsky equations describing exactly , for any assumed interaction between the particles , the motion of few - body systems @xcite .",
    "however , the exact solution of these equations requires sophisticated techniques whose difficulty increases when increasing the number of particles .",
    "there are a countless number of examples of quantum - mechanical few - body systems , from few - electron quantum dots in solid state physics to constituent quarks in subnuclear physics .",
    "the intricate feature of the few - body systems is that they develop individual characters depending on the number of constituent particles .",
    "the most important cause of these differences are the correlated motion and the pauli principle .",
    "this individuality requires specific methods for the solution of the few - body schrdinger equation , approximate solutions assuming restricted model spaces ( as for example the mean field approximation ) failing to describe these systems .",
    "the solution of any few - particle system may be found in a simple and unified approach .",
    "a recent widely used method is the stochastic variational @xcite , a variational approach where the trial wave function is generated by a random search on an adequate basis .",
    "an alternative powerful tool is an expansion of the trial wave function in terms of hyperspherical harmonic ( hh ) functions .",
    "the idea is to generalize the simplicity of the spherical harmonic expansion for the angular functions of a single particle motion to a system of particles by introducing a global length @xmath5 , called the hyperradius , and a set of angles , @xmath6 .",
    "for the hh expansion method to be practical , the evaluation of the potential energy matrix elements must be feasible .",
    "the main difficulty of this method is to construct hh functions of proper symmetry for a system of identical particles .",
    "this is a difficult problem that may be overcome by means of the hh formalism based on the symmetrization of the @xmath0body wave function with respect to the symmetric group using the barnea and novoselsky algorithm @xcite .",
    "this method , applied in nuclear physics for @xmath7 @xcite , has only been applied to quark physics for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "therefore , its generalization would be ideally suited for the study of the properties of multiquark systems .    during the last few years",
    "there has been a renewed interest on the possible existence of multiquark states , specially four- ( two quarks and two antiquarks ) and five - quark ( four quarks and one antiquark ) , in the low - energy hadron spectroscopy .",
    "theoretically , the possible existence of four - quark bound states was already suggested thirty years ago , both in the light - quark sector by jaffe @xcite and in the heavy - quark sector by iwasaki @xcite .",
    "experimentally , there were several analysis suggesting the existence of non-@xmath9 states in the high energy part of the charmonium spectrum @xcite .",
    "the recent series of discoveries of new meson resonances whose properties do not fit into the predictions of the naive quark model , has reopened the interest on the possible role played by non-@xmath9 configurations in the hadron spectra @xcite . among them",
    "one could mention the @xmath10 @xcite , the @xmath11 @xcite or the new @xmath12 and @xmath13 resonances @xcite .",
    "out of the several interpretations proposed for these states , those based on four - quark states are majority @xcite",
    ". there seems to be a consensus that a four - quark system containing two - light and two - heavy quarks , @xmath14 , is stable against dissociation into two mesons , @xmath15 , if the ratio of the mass of the heavy to the light quark is large enough @xcite .",
    "while the conclusions agree for the @xmath16 system , there are more discrepancies about the @xmath17 system @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of four - quark states in the low - lying meson spectra has been used to advance in the understanding of the light - scalar mesons , @xmath18 . in this case , four - quark states have been justified to coexist with @xmath9 states in the energy region below 2 gev because they can couple to @xmath19 without orbital excitation @xcite , and therefore conventional @xmath20 states are expected to mix with four - quark states to yield physical mesons @xcite .",
    "the four - heavy quark states have not received as much attention in the last years as the ones containing light quarks .",
    "iwasaki @xcite , based on the constituent quark mass value obtained within a string model for hadrons , argued that four - charm quark states could exist in the 6 gev energy region . using a variational method with gaussian trial radial wave functions and two - body potentials based on the exchange of color octets between quarks , ader _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained non stable @xmath21 states . however , using a potential derived from the mit bag model in the born - oppenheimer approximation the same authors concluded that the @xmath22 state was bound by 35 mev .",
    "heller and tjon @xcite considered also the mit bag model improving the born - oppenheimer approximation with a correct treatment of the kinetic energy , non stable @xmath21 states were found . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath23 @xmath21 states were analyzed in the framework of a chromomagnetic model where only a constant hyperfine potential , not depending on radial coordinates , was retained . with these assumptions no",
    "bound @xmath24 states were found .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using the bhaduri potential and solving variationally the four - body problem in a harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "recently , lloyd and vary @xcite investigated the @xmath22 system using a nonrelativistic hamiltonian inspired by the one - gluon exchange potential diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a harmonic oscillator basis , obtaining several close - lying bound states .",
    "the discussion above illustrates that the theoretical predictions for the existence of four - quark systems differ depending basically on the method used to solve the four - body problem and the interaction employed .",
    "it is our aim in this work to make a general study of four - quark systems of identical flavor in an exact way . for this purpose",
    "we will generalize the hh method @xcite , widely used in traditional nuclear physics for the study of few - body nuclei , to study four - quark systems .",
    "there are two main difficulties , first the simultaneous treatment of particles and antiparticles , and second the additional color degree of freedom . as a test of our formalism",
    "we will recover some results present in the literature .",
    "finally , we will make a general study of four - quark systems of identical flavor by means of the constituent quark model of ref .",

    "[ summary ] we resume our most important conclusions .",
    "the system of two quarks and two antiquarks with the same flavor can be regarded as a system of four identical particles .",
    "each particle carries a @xmath26 spin label and a @xmath27 color label .",
    "both quarks and antiquarks are spin @xmath28 particles , but whereas a quark color state belongs to the @xmath27 fundamental representation @xmath29 $ ] , an antiquark color state is a member of the fundamental representation @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the four - body wave function is a sum of outer products of color , spin and configuration terms @xmath31 coupled to yield an antisymmetric wave function with a set of quantum numbers that reflects the symmetries of the system .",
    "these are the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath32 , its projection @xmath33 , and the @xmath27 color state @xmath34 ( to avoid confusion with the charge conjugation quantum number the color degree of freedom will be labeled as @xmath34 from now on ) , which by assumption must belong for physical states to the @xmath27 color singlet representation .",
    "since qcd preserves parity , parity is also a good quantum number . another relevant quantum number to the system under consideration it is the @xmath25parity , @xmath35 , i.e. , the symmetry under interchange of quarks and antiquarks .    to obtain a solution of the four - body schrdinger equation we eliminate the center of mass and use the relative , jacobi , coordinates @xmath36 .",
    "then we expand the spatial part of the wave - function using the hh basis .",

    "we use a strong coupling constant given by , @xmath150 where @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are parameters fitted within a global description of the meson spectra  @xcite .",
    "finally , any model imitating qcd should incorporate confinement .",
    "lattice calculations in the quenched approximation derived , for heavy quarks , a confining interaction linearly dependent on the interquark distance .",
    "the consideration of sea quarks apart from valence quarks ( unquenched approximation ) suggest a screening effect on the potential when increasing the interquark distance @xcite .",
    "creation of light - quark pairs out of vacuum in between the quarks becomes energetically preferable resulting in a complete screening of quark color charges at large distances .",
    "string breaking has been definitively confirmed through lattice calculations @xcite in coincidence with the quite rapid crossover from a linear rising to a flat potential well established in su(2 ) yang - mills theories @xcite .",
    "a screened potential simulating these results can be written as @xmath154 at short distances this potential presents a linear behavior with an effective confinement strength @xmath155 , while it becomes constant at large distances .",
    "such screened confining potentials provide with an explanation to the missing state problem in the baryon spectra @xcite , improve the description of the heavy meson spectra @xcite , and justify the deviation of the meson regge trajectories from the linear behavior for higher angular momentum states @xcite .",
    "the results for the @xmath22 states have been obtained in the framework of the hyperspherical harmonic formalism explained above up to the maximum value of @xmath156 within our computational capabilities , being @xmath157 for positive parity states and @xmath158 for negative parity states with the exception of @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath161 ) and @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "the two - body problem has been solved using the numerov algorithm ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) and all the model parameters fixed in the description of the @xmath9 spectra @xcite . since the only relevant two - meson decay thresholds for these four - quark systems are those formed by two @xmath164 mesons , we summarize in table [ t1 ] the results obtained for the charmonium spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite compared with the experimental data quoted by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite .",
    "it can be observed that the energy difference in the @xmath165wave @xmath166 multiplets due to the non - central terms is less than 50 mev . although these terms are known to play an important role in the description of the light @xmath9 states , their contribution becomes smaller as the mass of the heavy quark increases @xcite .",
    "this allows to neglect them on the four - body sector , because they would only provide with a fine tune of the final results but making the solution of the four - body problem much more involved and time consuming .    to analyze the stability of these systems against dissociation through strong decay , @xmath167 , parity ( @xmath168 ) , @xmath25parity ( @xmath35 ) , and total angular momentum ( @xmath32 )",
    "must be preserved .",

    "once the meson masses have been obtained , the corresponding thresholds can be computed simply adding the mesons masses @xmath173 and @xmath174 , @xmath175 . in table [ t2 ]",
    "we indicate the lowest two - meson decay threshold for each set of quantum numbers .",
    "four - quark states will be stable under strong interaction if their total energy lies below all possible , and allowed , two - meson thresholds .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath176 in such a way that if @xmath177 the four - quark system will fall apart into two mesons , while @xmath178 will indicate that such strong decay is forbidden and therefore the decay , if allowed , must be weak or electromagnetic , being its width much narrower .",
    "let us first of all analyze the convergence of the expansion in terms of hyperspherical harmonics .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the variation of the energy of the @xmath18 and @xmath179 cases with @xmath156 , this behavior being similar for the other quantum numbers . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the convergence is slow , and the effective potential techniques @xcite are unable to improve it . in order to obtain a more adequate value for the energy we have extrapolated it according to the expression @xmath180 where @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are fitted parameters . in table [ t2b ]",
    "we show the values obtained for @xmath181 for the two states shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] as a function of the fitting range @xmath184 .",
    "it can be checked that the values obtained for @xmath181 are stable within @xmath18510 mev for @xmath186 .",
    "the values obtained for the @xmath183 parameter are very similar for all possible quantum numbers , being in all cases in the range @xmath187 , corresponding the lower limit to the positive parity states and the upper one to the negative parity states .",
    "the origin of the difficulties to obtain a better convergence can be traced back to two different aspects of these systems . on the one hand ,",
    "the hh formalism is better suited to deal with bound states , however , in this particular case we will show that most of the four - quark states are above the corresponding two - meson threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "the color structure of a four - quark system is more involved than that of @xmath9 or @xmath188 systems @xcite , with two different possibilities to obtain a color singlet .",
    "this makes possible the existence of repulsive contributions due to the color operator of the interacting potential , eqs .",
    "( [ oge ] ) and ( [ confi ] ) .",
    "although the total interaction is always confining , these deconfining terms make the convergence much slower .",
    "we have studied all possible @xmath189 quantum numbers with @xmath23 .",
    "we show in table [ t3 ] the results obtained for @xmath190 , the maximum value of @xmath156 calculated , the results obtained using the extrapolation of eq .",
    "( [ extra ] ) , the corresponding threshold for each set of quantum numbers , and the value of @xmath191 , eq . ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "a first glance to the results shows that there are two sets of quantum numbers , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , where the four - quark configuration is clearly below the corresponding two - meson threshold for dissociation .",
    "the @xmath159 and @xmath194 states are very close to the threshold and all the other quantum numbers are far above the corresponding threshold . being all possible strong decays",
    "forbidden they should be narrow states with typical widths of the order of a few mev .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath3 correspond to exotic states , those whose quantum numbers can not be obtained from a @xmath9 configuration , and therefore , if experimentally observed , they would be easily distinguished as a clear signal of pure non@xmath195 states .",
    "the energies obtained for the negative parity states are , as expected , much higher than those of positive parity and therefore all of them are far above the corresponding thresholds , @xmath196 mev .",
    "thus , they will fall apart immediately and therefore they should be very broad and difficult to detect .",
    "let us also note that the experimental observation stating that a unit of angular momentum ( parity change ) in the @xmath188 and @xmath9 sector costs approximately 400@xmath197500 mev of excitation energy in all flavor sectors ( with some remarkable exceptions as the light scalar mesons @xcite ) has an equivalent in the four - quark sector , being in this case the energy difference due to the parity change @xmath198 mev .",
    "the existence of non@xmath195 signals in the meson spectra has been the subject of an intensive debate @xcite .",
    "to analyze whether the existence of bound states with exotic quantum numbers could be a characteristic feature of the heavy quark sector or it is also present in the light sector we show in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the value of @xmath191 as a function of the quark mass for all exotic quantum numbers and in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] for the remaining positive parity states .",
    "since each quantum number has a different threshold these figures should be interpreted carefully .",
    "one should notice that the value @xmath199 in both figures corresponds to @xmath200 , and therefore , the fact that one state is below the others in these figures do not imply that its total mass would be smaller .",
    "let us also note that since the heavy quarks are isoscalar states , the flavor wave function of the four heavy - quark states will be completely symmetric with total isospin equal to zero .",
    "therefore , one should compare the results obtained in the light - quark case with a completely symmetric flavor wave function , i.e. , the isotensor states .    in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we observe how one of the four - quark non - exotic positive parity states , the @xmath2 , becomes more bound when the quark mass is decreased , @xmath201 mev for @xmath202 mev .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath19 states , that were slightly above the threshold for @xmath203 mev , increase their attraction when the quark mass is increased and only for masses above 3 gev , close to the bottom quark mass , may be bound .",
    "with respect to the exotic quantum numbers , we observe in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] that the @xmath204 and @xmath205 are not bound for any value of the quark mass .",
    "the @xmath3 state decreases its binding when the quark mass diminishes and it becomes unbound for masses of the order of 500 mev , the strange quark mass . only the @xmath1 four - quark state becomes more deeply bound when the constituent quark mass decreases , and therefore only one bound state with exotic quantum numbers would remain in the light - quark sector .",
    "taking the experimental mass for the threshold @xmath206 in the light - quark case , one can estimate the energy region where these states can be found , being @xmath207 mev , @xmath208 mev , @xmath209 mev , and @xmath210 mev .",
    "note that the boson exchange potentials , that as explained in sect .",
    "ii are present in the description of the light - quark sector , have not been considered in this analysis .",
    "although these terms do play a role in the description of the four - quark state total energy , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that their suppression will not alter the relative order of the four - quark states .",
    "the four - quark states with quantum numbers @xmath19 and @xmath2 have been analyzed with the complete constituent quark model including boson exchanges using a variational approach @xcite , obtaining 1004 mev and 1500 mev respectively , both in good agreement with our calculation and therefore giving confidence on our approach neglecting the boson exchange interactions in this particular analysis .",
    "the states with exotic quantum numbers would be higher in energy , being @xmath211 mev , @xmath212 mev and @xmath213 mev .",
    "there are experimental evidences for three states with exotic quantum numbers in the light - quark sector .",
    "two of them are isovectors with quantum numbers @xmath214 named @xmath215 and @xmath216 , and one isotensor @xmath194 , the @xmath217 @xcite . based on the coupling of the @xmath215 to the @xmath218 decay channel a possible four - quark structure has been suggested @xcite while the strong @xmath219 coupling of the @xmath216 makes it a good candidate for a pure hybrid state @xcite .",
    "the large mass obtained in our analysis for these quantum numbers makes doubtful the identification of any of them , and in particular of the @xmath215 , with a pure four - quark state , although a complete calculation with the proper flavor wave function is needed before drawing a definitive conclusion @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation of the @xmath215 in terms of low - energy rescattering effects has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite while recent reanalysis of experimental data from e852 collaboration with improved statistics show no evidence of any exotic meson with a mass close to 1.6 gev @xcite .",
    "concerning the @xmath217 , being its experimental mass 1600@xmath185100 mev , a possible tetraquark configuration seems likely .",
    "in this work we have presented for the first time a generalization of the hh formalism to study systems made of quarks and antiquarks of the same flavor . for this purpose",
    "we made use of standard techniques widely used in nuclear physics that have been adapted to include the color degree of freedom and to treat explicitly the @xmath25parity .",
    "this formalism opens the door to an exact study of multiquark systems up to now described by means of different techniques , being the variational methods the most standard ones .",
    "the particular color structure of four - quark systems makes the convergence slow but attainable .",
    "the formalism has been applied to study the existence of @xmath23 four - charm quark states . for this purpose we made use of a well - established constituent quark model that properly accounts for the charmed meson and baryon spectra .",
    "our results suggest the possible existence of three four - quark bound states with quantum numbers @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 and masses of the order of 6515 , 6648 , and 6216 mev .",
    "the two states with exotic quantum numbers , clearly below their corresponding two - meson threshold , should present narrow widths and , if produced , may be easily detected .",
    "we have analyzed the variation of our results with the constituent quark mass . in the light - quark case",
    "only the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quantum numbers remain bound , being the @xmath1 the lowest one with an energy close to 1800 mev .",
    "the four - quark state with quantum numbers @xmath205 lies around 2900 mev , far from the experimental states @xmath215 and @xmath216 , therefore supporting a hybrid configuration or a more complicated structure in terms of non - resonant structures . a possible description of the @xmath217 as a",
    "four - quark has also been justified .",
    "the program we have started for and exact study of multiquark systems by means of the hh formalism will be accomplished by implementing the possibility of treating quarks of different masses .",
