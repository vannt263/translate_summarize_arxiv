    "the epoxi mission of opportunity is a re - purposing of the deep impact flyby spacecraft , and comprises the extrasolar planet observation and characterization ( epoch ) investigation and the deep impact extended investigation ( dixi ) .",
    "the primary goal of epoch was to scrutinize a small set of known transiting extrasolar planets . from 2008 january to 2008 august , we used the high resolution imaging ( hri ) instrument @xcite and a broadband visible filter to construct high precision , high phase coverage and high cadence light curves for seven targets .",
    "we observed each target nearly continuously for several weeks at a time .",
    "the main science goals of epoch were to refine the system parameters of the known planets , to search for additional planets both directly ( via transits of the additional body ) and indirectly ( via induced changes in the transits of the known planet ) , and to constrain the reflected light from the known planet at secondary eclipse .",
    "it is also useful to provide updated periods and times of epoch for these systems in order to reduce uncertainties on predicted transit and eclipse times , and therefore maximize the return of follow - up observations . in previous epoch papers",
    "we have presented the search for additional planets in the gj  436 system @xcite and the secondary eclipse constraints for hat - p-7 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the updated system parameters , including constraints on the transit timing and changes in the transit parameters , and secondary eclipse constraints for a further four targets : hat - p-4 , tres-3 , tres-2 and wasp-3 , introduced below . the search for additional planets in these systems",
    "will be presented in a separate paper ( ballard et al . in prep ) .",
    "the exoplanet hat - p-4b @xcite , orbits a slightly evolved metal - rich late f star . with a mass of 0.68 @xmath18 and a radius of 1.27 @xmath1",
    ", it joined the ranks of inflated planets that have continued to challenge models of the physical structure of hot jupiters .",
    "tres-3 @xcite is notable for its very short orbital period of 1.30619 days .",
    "this proximity to the star makes tres-3 a promising target for observations of reflected light at visible wavelengths ; the planet - to - star flux ratio as measured in reflected light during the secondary eclipse is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the geometric albedo , @xmath21 is the planetary radius and @xmath22 is the semi - major axis of the planetary orbit .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have observed secondary eclipses of tres-3 at visible and near - infrared wavelengths , and the emerging picture of the planetary atmosphere is one with efficient day - night re - circularization and no temperature inversion in the upper atmosphere .",
    "this is in contrast to predictions of a temperature inversion based on the high level of irradiation @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the transit timing variations of tres-3 and noted significant outliers from a constant period . @xcite",
    "monitored further transit times of tres-3 and ruled out sub - earth mass planets in the exterior and interior 2:1 resonances for circular orbits .",
    "tres-2 @xcite was the first transiting planet found in the field of view of the nasa _ kepler _ mission @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that the high impact parameter ( @xmath23 ) of tres-2 made transit parameters such as inclination and duration sensitive to changes due to orbital precession . @xcite and @xcite claimed a significantly shorter duration for tres-2 transits two years after the measurements of @xcite .",
    "they proposed that this was caused by a change in orbit inclination due to precession , and that the duration would continue to decrease .",
    "however , @xcite measured a duration consistent with @xcite and @xcite and did not see the predicted trend of decreasing transit duration .",
    "secondary eclipses of tres-2 have been observed in the near - infrared @xcite , and the results favor a thermal inversion in the upper atmosphere , supporting the hypothesis that highly irradiated planetary atmospheres have inversions .",
    "the transit timing variations of tres-2 have been studied by @xcite and @xcite , who find no statistically significant variations .",
    "wasp-3b @xcite , with a short period ( 1.84634 days ) and a hot host star ( f7-f8v , @xmath24k ) , is one of the hottest transiting planets known , and another very good target for observing reflected light at secondary eclipse .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations and generation of the light curves are described in section [ sec : data ] , the transit analysis is presented in section [ sec : res ] , the secondary eclipse analysis is presented in section [ sec : eclipses ] and the results are discussed in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the epoch observations were made using the high resolution imager ( hri ) , which has a 30-cm aperture and a 1024@xmath251024 pixel ccd . for our observations we used a clear visible filter , covering 3501000 nm , in order to maximize the throughput of photons .",
    "the integration time for the science observations was 50 seconds , which for near - continuous observations results in roughly 1500 images per day .",
    "since the on - board spacecraft memory is only 300 mb , we initially chose to read out only a @xmath26 pixel sub - array of the full ccd , to ensure full phase coverage between data downlinks from the spacecraft .",
    "the ccd comprises four quadrants that are read out independently , and the sub - array is centered on the ccd where the four quadrants meet .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.4 arcsec pixel@xmath27 , resulting in a sub - array field of view of 0.72 square arcminutes .",
    "the images are significant defocused , resulting in a stellar point - spread function ( psf ) with a full - width half maximum of 4 arcseconds .",
    "typically this meant that the target star was the only star in the field of view , and we were unable to employ relative photometry techniques for removing correlated noise in the light curves .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] summarizes the observing schedules for each of the four targets .",
    "hat - p-4 and tres-3 , along with gj436 and xo-2 , were observed during the initial observing block from 2008 january to 2008 may .",
    "the project was awarded an additional contingent observing block from 2008 june to 2008 august , during which time hat - p-4 was re - observed , and tres-2 and wasp-3 were also observed . during the contingent observations we began observing in a larger @xmath28 pixel sub - array mode , to reduce losses from pointing drifts that occasionally resulted in the target star lying outside of the @xmath26 pixel sub - array field of view .",
    "the number of images that could be obtained with the larger sub - array mode between data downlinks from the spacecraft was constrained by the data storage capacity on board the spacecraft .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the phase coverage we chose to restrict observations in the @xmath28 pixel sub - array mode to the times of particular interest  during the transits and secondary eclipses .",
    "one event per data downlink could be observed in the larger sub - array mode without reducing the temporal coverage .",
    "table [ tab : obs ] shows the total number of transits and eclipses observed for each target , with the number observed in the @xmath28 pixel sub - array mode given in parentheses . as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , tres-2 was claimed to show changes in the transit inclination with time .",
    "therefore , we used the larger sub - array mode to observe the transits of tres-2 where possible .",
    "wasp-3 was a promising target for secondary eclipse observations , and therefore we observed the secondary eclipses of wasp-3 in the larger mode where possible . for hat - p-4",
    "we observed two of the three transits and two of the three eclipses obtained in the contingent observations in the @xmath28 pixel sub - array mode .",
    "tres-3 was observed in the initial observing block and no observations were obtained in the larger mode .",

    "these data have been bias- and dark - subtracted and flat - fielded , using calibration images obtained on the ground before launch . due to the very high precision required in the light curves",
    ", we perform several additional calibration steps to account for changes in the ccd since launch .",
    "the spacecraft pointing drifts considerably with time , resulting in significant coverage of the ccd by the stellar psf and placing paramount importance on the flat - fielding .",
    "the procedure is described in @xcite and summarized here .    for each target",
    ", we use a psf constructed from the images to locate the position of the star to a hundredth of a pixel . at this stage",
    "we reject images with @xmath29 outliers from the psf fit , assuming the stellar psf to be contaminated by an energetic particle hit .",
    "we subtract a time - dependent bias calculated for each quadrant from the corresponding overscan region .",
    "we reduce the pixels in the central columns and rows of the ccd ( forming the internal boundaries between the quadrants ) by roughly 15% and 1% respectively , to correct an artifact produced by the ccd readout electronics . for data obtained in the @xmath28 pixel mode ,",
    "we scale the images by a constant ( typically differing from unity by one part in a thousand ) to correct an observed flux offset between the two sub - array modes .    in order to track time - dependent changes in the flat - field since launch",
    ", there is a small green led stimulation lamp that can be switched on to illuminate the ccd .",
    "we obtained blocks of 200 calibration frames using this lamp , which were taken every few days throughout the observations , alternating between blocks in the smaller and larger sub - array modes in the contingent observations .",
    "we correct each science frame by the flat - field generated from lamp images taken in the same sub - array mode .",
    "we assume any remaining flat - field errors to be color - dependent and therefore unable to be addressed by the monochromatic lamp .",
    "we perform aperture photometry , using a circular aperture of radius 10 pixels .",
    "the resulting light curves exhibit significant correlated noise on the order of 1% , which is associated with the drift in the spacecraft pointing . in order to correct for this ,",
    "we use the data itself to generate a sensitivity map of the ccd .",
    "we assume the out - of - transit and out - of - eclipse data to be of uniform brightness , with two caveats .",
    "first , the star may have intrinsic variations in stellar brightness due to spots .",
    "only one of the four targets displayed long - period variability ( figure [ fig : tres3_fulllc_noise ] ) , and this was removed by fitting and removing a polynomial in time before producing the ccd sensitivity map .",
    "second , transits of additional planets may be present , which will be suppressed with this treatment @xcite .",
    "we randomly draw several thousand of the out - of - transit and out - of - eclipse points and find a robust average flux of the 30 spatially nearest neighbors .",
    "we use this set of averages to generate a two - dimensional surface spline to the flux distribution across the ccd .",
    "each point in the light curve is then corrected by interpolating onto this surface .",
    "the entire procedure is iterated several times to converge on the positions and scaling factors that result in the lowest scatter in the out - of - transit and out - of - eclipse data in the final light curve .",
    "the robustness of the surface spline for each target depends on the coverage of the ccd by that target .",
    "if the coverage is small and the corresponding density of photometry apertures high , then there is a high probability that the same pixel will be returned to multiple times over the observations .",
    "having flux measurements separated in time reduces the influence of stellar activity on our calibration of the sensitivity of each pixel .",
    "figure [ fig : positions_compare ] shows the complete ccd coverage for two targets .",
    "tres-2 is well confined on the ccd and the density of photometry apertures leads to a more robust surface spline .",
    "the tres-2 light curve prior to and post the application of the surface spline is shown in figure [ fig : tres2_fulllc_noise ] . on the other hand , the photometry apertures for wasp-3 sample a much larger area of the ccd , and in addition many of the observations obtained in the 256@xmath25256 pixel sub - array mode do not overlay the central 128@xmath25128 pixel sub - array .",
    "the resulting surface spline is therefore more sensitive to noise introduced by stellar activity or systematics that are not an artifact of the pointing jitter .",
    "the wasp-3 light curve prior to and post the application of the surface spline is shown in figure [ fig : wasp3_fulllc_noise ] .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : wasp3_fulllc_noise ] shows how the noise in the final calibrated wasp-3 light curve bins down compared with the expectation for gaussian noise , and the poor quality of the data is due to the low density of the ccd coverage for wasp-3 .    128 pixel sub - array when observations were obtained in the 256@xmath25256 pixel sub - array .",
    "this reduces the quality of the surface spline and results in a larger component of correlated noise in the wasp-3 light curve.,width=288 ]      the final hat - p-4 light curve is shown in figure [ fig : hatp4_fulllc_noise ] .",
    "hat - p-4 was the first epoch target observed , initially for 22 days from 2008 january 22 to 2008 february 12 , during the original epoch target schedule , and again for 8 days from 2008 june 29 to 2008 july 7 during the contingent observations .",
    "of the 45,320 images obtained of hat - p-4 , 5434 were discarded due to the star being either out of the field of view or too close to the edge of the ccd to measure accurate photometry , 1305 were discarded due to energetic particle hits , and 76 were discarded due to readout smear , for a final total of 38,505 acceptable images .",

    "the points do not follow the line , indicating residual correlated noise in the light curve.,width=384 ]    the final tres-3 light curve is shown in figure [ fig : tres3_fulllc_noise ] .",
    "tres-3 was the second epoch target observed , for 12 days from 2008 march 6 to 2008 march 18 .",
    "the gap in the light curve from 25 days is due to a ` pre - look ' for the subsequent epoch target , xo-2 , which was performed in order to refine the pointing for that target .",
    "we obtained a total of 14,195 images of tres-3 , of which we discarded 1165 due to the star being out of or too close to the edge of the field of view , 1632 due to energetic particle hits and 127 due to readout smear , leaving 11,271 images .",
    "we obtained all of the tres-3 data in the @xmath26 pixel sub - array mode .",
    "after the initial application of the two - dimensional surface spline a long timescale , low amplitude variability was evident in the light curve .",
    "this can be seen in the lower light curve in figure [ fig : tres3_fulllc_noise ] .",
    "in order to remove this variability we bin the out - of - transit data by two hours and fit with a time - dependent fifth - order polynomial for the data occurring later than 4.0 days .",

    "the two - dimensional surface spline relies on multiple visits to the same part of the ccd to characterize robustly the interpixel variations .",
    "this is particularly true for the data that occur during the transits and eclipses , since they can not be assumed to be of uniform flux and are therefore excluded from the creation of the surface . in order to effectively flat - field",
    "the data that are taken during transit and eclipse , the observations taken during these times must be gathered at the same spatial positions as data obtained at other times . in the case of wasp-3 , four of the eight",
    "secondary eclipses occurred at locations that were poorly sampled .",
    "no out - of - transit or out - of - eclipse observations fell on these pixels , and therefore we can not estimate the true sensitivity of these pixels in order to produce an effective flat - field . these eclipses occur at 1.0 , 17.6 , 19.3 and 26.6 days , and can be seen in the light curve as increases in flux .",
    "these four eclipses are discarded for the final analysis . besides these events , a significant fraction of the wasp-3 data are distributed in poorly - sampled areas of the ccd , degrading the robustness of the two - dimensional surface spline .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : wasp3_fulllc_noise ] demonstrates the adverse effect this has on the noise properties of the final light curve , as the data do not bin down as expected for gaussian noise",

    "for the transit analysis , we make several additional calibration steps .",
    "the two - dimensional surface spline uses only a fraction of the data to generate the surface , in order to preserve as much of the information in the light curve as possible , and to minimize the suppression of transits of putative additional planets .",
    "however for the transit analysis , we use all of the available data to calibrate each event .",
    "for each transit , we define a window approximately three times the duration of the transit , centered on the predicted transit time .",
    "we take each point in this window and divide the flux by a robust average of the 30 spatially nearest points that do not fall in any of the transit windows .",
    "this is essentially a point - by - point application of the full two - dimensional surface spline .",
    "we then fit a slope , linear with time , to the out - of - transit data across each transit and divide it out , to remove any residual long timescale trends .    for tres-3 , tres-2 and wasp-3",
    ", we generate non - linear limb - darkening coefficients of the form given by @xcite , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the specific intensity at the center of the disk and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the angle between the emergent intensity and the line of sight .",
    "we use photon - weighted stellar atmosphere models of @xcite that bracket the published values of stellar @xmath36 and log @xmath37 , and convolve these with the total epoxi response function , including filter , optics and ccd response .",
    "we fit for the four coefficients of the non - linear form of the limb - darkening using 17 positions across the stellar limb , at 2  nm intervals along the 3501000  nm bandpass .",
    "we calculate the final set of coefficients as the weighted average when integrated over the bandpass , and bi - linearly interpolate across @xmath36 and log  @xmath37 for each target .",
    "the final set of coefficient for each targets is given in table [ tab : tres3 ] for tres-3 , table [ tab : tres2 ] for tres-2 and table [ tab : wasp3 ] for wasp-3 .",
    "the quality of the epoch light curves is nearly sufficient to fit for the limb - darkening coefficients rather than assuming theoretical values .",
    "ultimately , the degeneracies between the geometric parameters of the transiting system and the limb - darkening coefficients prevent us from placing meaningful constraints on the coefficients . in the case of hat - p-4",
    "however , the system is very close to edge - on ( @xmath38 degrees ) , which reduces the parameter space considerably",
    ". therefore , for hat - p-4 we instead use a quadratic equation for the limb - darkening , @xmath39 , and allow two linear combinations of the coefficients , @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be free parameters in the transit analysis , which produced a better fit to the data as defined below .",
    "when fitting the transits , we use the analytic equations of @xcite to generate a model transit , and use @xmath42 as a goodness - of - fit estimator .",
    "we use the levenberg - marquardt algorithm to fit three dimensionless geometric parameters of the system : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and cos @xmath45 , where @xmath21 is the planetary radius , @xmath46 is the stellar radius , @xmath22 is the semi - major axis of the planetary orbit and @xmath45 is the inclination of the orbit .",
    "we fix the period to the published value , but allow the time of center of transit to vary independently for each of the transits .",
    "we then use the published mass values for each of the systems to convert the transit parameters to physical properties , drawing values from @xcite for hat - p-4 , @xcite for tres-3 , @xcite for tres-2 and @xcite for wasp-3 .",

    "we also give the transit duration from first to fourth contact for each best - fit model .",
    "for wasp-3 , we discard the final transit ( which was significantly offset in flux due to correlated noise ) , and also a partial transit ( which included only the ingress ) , for a total of six transits .",

    "the errors on the parameters are calculated using the residual permutation `` rosary bead '' method @xcite . for each target , we find the residuals to the best - fit model .",
    "we shift these residuals forward collectively to the next time stamp and add the best fit models back to the new residuals , generating a new realization of the light curve which retains the correlated noise signals in the original light curve .",
    "we repeat this process 8000 times ( covering approximately six days ) and each time we fit for and record the geometric parameters , times of center of transit , and limb - darkening coefficients where appropriate . for each parameter",
    "we construct a histogram of the 8000 measurements , to which we fit a gaussian .",
    "we then define the error on that parameter by the half - width half - maximum value of the best fit gaussian .",
    "we find that increasing the number of iterations beyond 4000 does not significantly change the calculated errors .",
