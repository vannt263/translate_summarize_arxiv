    "a next generation of nuclear and particle physics experiments will require increasingly pure materials for success .",
    "the signatures of extremely rare processes such as neutrino interaction and oscillation , double beta decay , and dark matter interaction , are often masked by common terrestrial backgrounds .",
    "new underground facilities may shield experiments from the background derived from cosmic radiation .",
    "however , isolating the physics processes from radiation in the experimental apparatus itself remains critical .",
    "radionuclides such as uranium , thorium and potassium-40 have long half lives and remain abundant in the earth s crust . the decay products of these nuclei and their daughters can often have the same low energy signatures of the rare processes studied . to enable experiments probing rare phenomena , new research into the selection of materials with very high purity in radionuclides",
    "a prime example is the kamland experiment  @xcite , which motivated this work .",
    "kamland , installed in the cavity of the concluded kamiokande experiment in the japanese kamioka underground laboratory , is detecting neutrino oscillations in disappearance mode using japanese nuclear power reactors as anti - neutrino sources  @xcite .",
    "its long baseline gives kamland sensitivity to @xmath4-values in the range of the so - called large mixing angle solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the flux weighted mean distance to 22 nuclear power stations in japan and korea is about 200 km .",
    "this large distance to the neutrino sources , which is essential for the physics , results in an extremely small anti - neutrino interaction rate of only about 2 per day in kamland s 1000 tons fiducial volume , consisting of organic liquid scintillator .",
    "+ owing to the low anti - neutrino energies , physics events can be masked by natural , anthropogenic and cosmogenic radioactivity .",
    "it has been estimated , that the concentrations of @xmath3k , @xmath5th and @xmath6u should not exceed @xmath7 g / g in order to not compromise the physics measurement  @xcite . as an example of the requirements in another organic material , concentrations of th and u in the acrylic vessel of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) were measured to be less than the specified limits of 10@xmath8 g / g  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work was therefore to test samples of the scintillation fluid for the presence of above elements at these very small concentrations .",
    "while direct radiation counting is the ideal analysis technique for radiation sensitive experiments , such analysis suffers from a lack of decay rate . as an example , at a concentration of @xmath7 g / g u the expected decay rate is about 1 per day per 100 kg of sample .",
    "the large sample size needed therefore becomes impractical . at the same concentration a 1",
    "kg sample contains about @xmath9 uranium atoms .",
    "direct detection of this large population of parent nuclei can be achieved with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ( icpms ) and neutron activation analysis ( naa ) .",
    "the secular equilibrium assumption in the uranium and thorium decay chains relate the parent population measurements to the expected radiation .    using efficient ion sources , sensitivities to @xmath6u of the required magnitude or even better",
    "have been reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , these methods require the nuclides of interest to be in aqueous solution . in order to apply mass spectroscopy to organic liquids",
    "requires the blank free , efficient transfer of the elements of interest into aqueous solution .",
    "this in turn requires chemical manipulations before the analysis .",
    "the purity of the used chemicals is hence crucial for achieving a low blank reading .",
    "the basic principles governing trace element analysis by means of naa have been worked out in great detail in the past .",
    "they shall hence not be discussed in this article .",
    "textbooks such as reference  @xcite give a comprehensive overview . a further important criterion which led us to choose naa as analysis tool was the fact that sensitivities even exceeding those required for our work have been reported in the literature  @xcite , proving feasibility .",
    "organic substances are , at least in principle , well suited for naa .",
    "hydro - carbons , consisting of c , h , n , o have no long lived activation products .",
    "the nuclides of interest , @xmath10k , @xmath5th and @xmath6u on the other hand , offer sizable capture cross sections and their activation products , @xmath11k , @xmath12pa and @xmath13np , have half lives greater than 12 hours , stable enough to allow decay radiation counting even after substantial shipping and processing delays . +",
    "a problem , however , arises from the fact that hydrocarbons tend to dissociate in a high neutron and gamma flux environment .",
    "this so called radiolysis leads to hydrogen outgassing inside the nuclear reactor used for the activation . in the previous work by the munich group  @xcite pressure build - up in the sample containment vessel ( and its potential rupture associated with sample loss ) was prevented by venting the excess gas into the pool water of the reactor  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used for liquid scintillator samples with up to 500 ml volume at the research reactor , frm i , in munich  @xcite .",
    "detection limits of @xmath14 g / g for k , @xmath15 g / g for th and @xmath16 g / g for u have been reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the munich group obtained further improved sensitivities of 1.8@xmath110@xmath17 g / g for th and 1.0@xmath110@xmath18",
    "g / g for u  @xcite .",
    "the direct irradiation of liquid samples does not require extensive sample preparation or treatment prior to the analysis , enhancing the robustness against the introduction of unwanted contaminations .",
    "although this procedure offers a number of positive features its use seems to be limited to the research reactor facility in munich .",
    "no research reactor could be found in the us which has an existing facility that would allow the irradiation of large liquid samples and the venting of potentially flammable gases into the coolant .",
    "we therefore decided to develop a novel technique , not requiring the venting of excess gases . in the approach described here",
    ", the organic materials are gently heated in a clean vacuum chamber , in order to evaporate most of the organic until less than one percent by mass remains .",
    "sample outgassing is substantially reduced , while most of the impurities survive evaporation and are analyzed in the residual organic .",
    "the sensitivities achieved with this new technique are not quite as stringent as those reported by the munich group but , to the best of our knowledge , they are only exceeded by this group .",
    "the main advantage of the approach described in this article lies in the fact that it can be used at almost any research reactor , it does not require expensive , unique irradiation facilities , and it is therefore generally applicable . irradiation facilities with very high neutron flux may also be used . at frm",
    "i the thermal neutron flux was limited to @xmath19 @xmath20s@xmath21 . by comparison the thermal neutron flux available at the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) of oak ridge national lab .",
    "and at the massachusetts institute of technology research reactor ( mitr ) of mit nuclear reactor laboratory is with @xmath22 @xmath20s@xmath21 and @xmath23 @xmath20s@xmath21 , respectively , substantially higher .",
    "both facilities were utilized in this work .",
    "our work focused on the analysis of radio impurities in kamland liquid scintillator and its components .",
    "the scintillator is composed of 80% dodecane ( c@xmath24h@xmath25 ) and 20% 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene ( pseudocumene , c@xmath26h@xmath24 ) .",
    "g / l solid 2,5-diphenyloxazole ( ppo , c@xmath27h@xmath28no ) , acting as the primary fluor , is dissolved in it .",
    "the analyzed samples of liquid scintillator were obtained directly from the kamland experimental site in japan . for sample collection and storage ,",
    "one liter pfa teflon containers were etched in sub - boiling 25% ultra - pure nitric acid and 25% ultra - pure hydrochloric acid over a period of one week .",
    "the containers were then rinsed with ultra - pure water ( milliq ) and dried .",
    "liquid scintillator was accessed in a clean room surrounding the liquid plumbing of the detector .",
    "an access tap was cleaned with alcohol and water , and then 5 liters of scintillator was drained through it .",
    "scintillator was then emptied into the collection containers , shaken and discarded . a second filling with scintillator",
    "was kept for analysis .",
    "the teflon containers were closed , heat sealed in class 100 grade nylon bags , and shipped to the analysis laboratories at caltech and the university of alabama in the united states .",
    "samples required further preparation at the united states laboratories prior to neutron activation .",
    "evaporation of the liquid at low temperature and under vacuum leaves behind most of the solid ppo powder , the least volatile component . the ppo can therefore be used as a convenient collection medium for the elements of interest . since for k , th and u",
    "only very few volatile chemical compounds exist , we would expect that recovery for the elements of interest after evaporating the liquid should be almost quantitative .    after evaporation the ppo was heated and transferred to a small container for irradiation .",
    "a plastic nalgene bottle of 1 cm diameter and 2 cm length was used initially for this purpose ; the lid was melted and fused to the bottle with a clean soldering iron . to reach lower blank levels and allow for longer irradiations , high purity , suprasil t21 quartz vessels from heraeus amersil were alternatively used in later irradiations . the quartz bottle derived from 8@xmath110 mm quartz tube stock .",
    "a 10 cm length was cut from the tube and blown shut in one end .",
    "the center of the tube was then pinched inwards until a 3 mm opening remained .",
    "the bottle was etched with a regimen of concentrated acids , followed by a rinse of ultrapure water . for ppo transfer ,",
    "the quartz was heated to near 80 @xmath29c to ensure efficient movement of the organic into the bottom of the bottle .",
    "on several runs , the evaporation beaker was rinsed by an additional one milliliter of liquid scintillator which was then also poured into the quartz vessel , which was then dried in the same apparatus .",
    "after loading the sample , the quartz vessels were sealed by melting the pinched area closed .",
    "liquid nitrogen was applied continuously to the bottom of the bottle in order to freeze the sample , and prevent mass loss through ppo melting and boiling ] .",
    "the sample preparation and analysis strategy depends critically on the retention of the elements of interest in the ppo .",
    "our measurements of the retention efficiency are discussed in section 5 .      evaporated ppo samples",
    "were then irradiated .",
    "a test run at hfir in october 2000 verified the feasibility of the techniques described above .",
    "the data reported here derive from irradiations at mitr between january , 2001 and july , 2002 .",
    "when encased in plastic bottles , the ppo samples were shown to survive 15 minutes in hfir or two hours in mitr before sample boiling caused plastic bottle breaches and losses . when sealed in quartz ,",
    "the sample containment survived at least 28 hours of irradiation in the mitr 2ph1 pneumatic facility , without evidence of loss .",
    "the neutron flux was calibrated at mitr by irradiating trace amounts of salts of sodium , potassium , chromium , zinc , bromine , strontium , tin , antimony , lanthanum , gold , thorium and uranium , all in identical quartz and plastic bottles .",
    "the calibrated neutron flux varied from 3.0 to 4.3@xmath30 thermal n/(@xmath31 s ) and from 4.1 to 8.9@xmath32 epithermal n/(@xmath31 s ) ( neutron energies larger than 0.5 ev ) , with a 8% precision in the determinations .",
    "the pneumatic tube 2ph1 is one of the highest neutron flux irradiation facilities at the mitr .",
    "this facility allows a sample to be inserted pneumatically into a heavy water reflector tank reentrant thimble for irradiation .",
    "once the irradiation is terminated , the sample is ejected to a hot cell that is used for temporary storage .",
    "a co@xmath33 purge is maintained in the thimble which helps to reduce the amount of @xmath10ar produced .",
    "the sample holder ( rabbit ) is a polyethylene cylinder that has a 1 - 3/8  i d and is 6 - 1/4  long .",
    "multiple ppo samples can be accommodated in one rabbit .",
    "after irradiation samples were allowed to cool at a hot cell for at least 12 hours , in order to minimize the radiation hazard of short - lived activities , such as @xmath34si .",
    "the samples were then packed for overnight fedex shipment to caltech and ua . the delay between sample ejection from the reactor and receipt at the laboratories was reduced to 35 hours , improving sensitivity to short - lived activities such as @xmath11k(t@xmath35=12.36 hours ) .    upon receipt at the analysis laboratories ,",
    "each sample was processed for radiation analysis in a fume hood .",
    "the processing involved several steps . in the first step , the exterior of each sample container , whether quartz or plastic , was cleaned , in order to remove external contamination unconnected with the sample .",
    "an initial acetone rinse removed residual organics and connected activities .",
    "then each sample container was immersed in a small bottle containing 60 ml of concentrated nitric acid or aqua regia .",
    "after one hour , each sample was moved to a fresh acid vessel and the process was repeated .",
    "the acetone and two acid washes were directly assayed to confirm that extractable contamination sharply dropped from one wash to the next .",
    "studies with additional exterior washes yielded external activities significantly lower than the activity extracted from the interior of all samples , indicating the procedure was effective .",
    "typical external activity reductions of @xmath36na greater than 1000 were achieved .",
    "no evidence of external uranium or thorium contamination was seen in the washes , and only trace potassium levels were seen .",
    "after exterior washes , the sample container was rinsed by pure water , and then broken to expose its interior .",
    "the open containers were placed in beakers to which strong nitric acid was added , in order to extract the radioactivity from the sample itself .",
    "the acid was heated to 80 @xmath29 c on a hot plate for over a half hour . at this temperature ,",
    "the sample of irradiated ppo was fully digested by the acid , forming a transparent yellow solution .",
    "the sample container was extracted from the hot acid , and rinsed with a few drops of acid back into the beaker .",
    "the acid was allowed to cool , which typically precipitated the ppo . by decanting or centrifugation ,",
    "the acid was extracted into a separate pe bottle .",
    "the process was then repeated in which a fresh batch redissolved the residual ppo sample and etched the sample container in a new beaker , to further extract adsorbed activity .",
    "all of these acid solutions were then collected and assayed .",
    "high purity germanium detector spectrometers at caltech and ua were used to assay the radionuclides in the acid .",
    "two such detectors exist at each institution for this work .",
    "each detector is surrounded by approximately 10 cm of lead and 5 cm of copper to reduce external backgrounds .",
    "it is important to note that a low background counting facility is essential for this study because radiochemistry separation methods are employed to remove competing activities .",
    "the detector performances vary in relative nai efficiency from 30 to 85% at 1332 kev , resolution from 2 to 5 kev , and ambient background from @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xmath39 at 300 kev .    during the acid counting , one",
    "is limited to 10 ppt sensitivity in a gram of irradiated material for activities tagging uranium and thorium .",

    "the acid is poured through a plastic column containing actinide absorbing resin ; the tru or actinide resin of eichrom technologies , inc . were used . to reduce the remaining ppo precipitant in the acid which may clog the column ,",
    "the acid was prefiltered with either a column of inactive resin or a disposable plastic filter .",
    "ideally , the column selectively absorbs actinide activities while allowing sodium , bromine , and other light elements to pass through harmlessly . in practice",
    ", we noted a reduction of greater than 100 for the sodium activity , and greater than 5 for bromine , for a typical background in the @xmath12pa and @xmath13np region of interest of @xmath42 .",
    "the 100 ml polyethylene bottle containing the extracted nitric acid was counted in a high resolution germanium detector for 12 hours or more , in order to detect the presence of short - lived nuclei .",
    "the acid counting focused on @xmath11k detection .",
    "the column was sealed in a bag and taped to the top of a germanium detector for radiation assay ; the column s small size ( 1 cm diameter by 5 cm long ) provided for a high efficiency in gamma ray detection .",
    "the column data provided a sensitive measure of uranium and thorium related activity .",
    "the detection efficiency of the germanium counters was determined using nine - activity solutions from isotope products laboratories and northern analytics with gamma activities spanning 88 to 1836 kev calibrated to 3% .",
    "the calibration solution was diluted with acid and then filled into containers with identical counting geometry and liquid volume as those used in the neutron activation analysis .",

    "the evaporation rate scales approximately linearly with the temperature and reaches 20",
    "g / h at 95@xmath29c .",
    "all sample evaporations were performed in the above temperature range and at a pressure of about 40 torr .    1 .",
    "all work was done in class 100 or 500 clean rooms , to avoid sample contamination .",
    "the evaporations were performed using sheldon model 1415 vacuum ovens .",
    "3 .   during evaporation vacuum was maintained using an oil free teflon diaphragm pump .    in order to provide an overall monitor of contamination during the sample preparation , empty",
    "quartz or plastic vessels were irradiated in parallel with samples . the procedure for evaporating",
    "the scintillator involves transferring the liquid between several pfa vessels until the ppo residue reaches the irradiation bottle , so that one is particularly sensitive to contamination during this sample handling .",
    "this contamination was monitored in practice by duplicating the procedures with ultrapure water .",
    "water certified to purity of @xmath05@xmath110@xmath58 g / g potassium and @xmath05@xmath1 10@xmath2g / g uranium and thorium was purchased from tama chemicals , and was evaporated in parallel to scintillator samples , using the same equipment . at the temperature and pressure used for scintillator evaporation , the water completely evaporates in a few hours .",
    "after opening the oven to recover the ppo beaker , one milliliter of fresh water was added to the blank evaporation beakers and was poured into quartz irradiation containers .",
    "these were evaporated to dryness in the same oven and sealed .",
    "the resulting containers were then irradiated and analyzed in parallel with the samples , using all the same steps and techniques described in the text ."
