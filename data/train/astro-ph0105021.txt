    "stellar mass loss is an essential ingredient in the modelling of several important astrophysical processes .",
    "it plays a key role in the chemical evolution of the galaxy , by returning to the interstellar medium the ashes of the nuclear - burning processes that took place during the star s lifetime . in asymptotic giant branch ( agb )",
    "stars , the mass loss rate is so large that the evolutionary timescale is controlled by mass loss rather than by nuclear burning .",
    "the general principles governing mass loss on the agb are understood .",
    "shock waves associated with the stellar pulsation push the gas far enough above the photosphere for dust to start condensing .",
    "radiation pressure on the dust , when it couples to the gas , then provides the necessary thrust for matter to escape ( e.g. , sedlmayr & winters 1997 ) .",
    "a parametrization of the mass loss rate on the agb , in terms of the fundamental stellar parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is not available from empirical data ( e.g. , zijlstra 1995 ) , but arndt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have proposed one based on computed models ( see below ) .",
    "the oldest among empirical mass - loss - rate parametrizations is the reimers formula ( reimers 1975 ; see zijlstra 1995 and sect . 11 of habing 1996 for a discussion of the more recent parametrizations ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a numerical factor [ introduced later by fusi - pecci & renzini ( 1976 ) and mengel ( 1976 ) ] of the order of unity .",
    "although the reimers formula provides a fair representation of the mass loss rates measured for g , k and ( non - long - period - variable ) m giants , it is well known that it predicts rates that are too low at the agb - tip ( e.g. , de jong 1983 ; willson 1987 ; bowen & willson 1991 ; blcker 1995 ) .",
    "the final agb masses obtained with a mass loss rate following the reimers prescription all the way to the agb - tip are too large to satisfy the initial - final mass relationship of weidemann ( 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , renzini ( 1981 ) suggested the existence of a short episode of strong mass loss close to the agb - tip ( dubbed ` superwind ' ) , with mass loss rates of the order of @xmath10 to @xmath11  m@xmath12  y@xmath13 , whereas the reimers formula predicts maximum mass loss rates of the order of @xmath14  m@xmath12  y@xmath13 .",
    "luminous agb stars with mass loss rates that large have since been found ( e.g. , de jong 1983 ; whitelock et al .",
    "1991 , 1994 ; vassiliadis & wood 1993 and references therein ) , as well as empirical evidences for a sudden increase of the mass loss rate at the end of the agb ( e.g. , delfosse et al . 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "there has been much speculation concerning the nature and cause of the superwind .",
    "willson ( 1981 ; her figs .  5 and 6 ) and bowen & willson ( 1991 ) argued that pulsation - driven mass loss in mira variables accounts for the required superwind . on the other hand ,",
    "netzer & elitzur ( 1993 ) argued that the mass loss rate abruptly increases when the dust couples to the gas , thus causing the superwind phase .",
    "detailed calculations of the agb evolution , including all the ingredients ( stellar structure , pulsation and shock waves , dust formation and coupling to the gas , radiative transfer ) necessary to trigger mass loss in a self - consistent way are now being performed for carbon - rich miras ( fleischer et al .",
    "1992 ; hfner et al . 1996",
    "; sedlmayr & winters 1997 ; winters et al . 2000 ) and reproduce the expected features of the superwind phase at the agb - tip ( schrder et al . 1999 ) .",
    "a parametrization of the mass loss rates , in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and based on the computed models , has been proposed by arndt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of mass loss to metallicity is one of the remaining question in the field .",
    "the low - metallicity behavior of dust- and pulsation - driven agb mass loss has been investigated by bowen & willson ( 1991 ) with the conclusion that low - metallicity agb stars reach the same mass loss rates than their higher metallicity counterparts , albeit at higher luminosities .",
    "this prediction is basically confirmed by observations of mass - losing agb stars in the magellanic clouds , which do not call for low mass loss rates at low @xmath7 ( see zijlstra 1999 and olofsson 1999 for recent reviews ) .",
    "giant stars in globular clusters are ideal targets to address these questions . in particular ,",
    "the variation of mass loss with luminosity may be easily followed , the impact on mass loss of the pulsation properties of the long - period variables may be investigated , as well as the impact of the subsolar metallicity characterizing globular - cluster stars .    among globular clusters ,",
    "47 tuc ( ngc 104 ) offers several advantages .",
    "it hosts many well - studied long - period variables ( sawyer - hogg 1973 , glass & feast 1973 , lloyd evans 1974 , fox 1982 , frogel 1983 ) , among which 4 mira variables ( v1 to v4 ) with periods ranging from 165 to 212  d , and visual amplitudes ranging from 1.5 to 4 mag .",
    "it is nearby ( distance modulus = 13.7 ; gratton et al .",
    "1997 ) and has been the subject of many previous studies providing auxiliary data like bolometric magnitudes from @xmath18 fluxes or assignments of its giant stars to either the agb or the rgb ( frogel et al .",
    "the basic parameters of 47  tuc are as follows : [ fe / h]@xmath19 , age @xmath20  gy ( gratton et al . 1997 ) , turnoff mass @xmath21  m@xmath12  ( hesser et al .",

    "( 1988 ) have performed a pointed observation of 47 tuc with iras , and detected several sources at 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath3 m ( see table  [ tab : irasiso ] ) . the use of isocam onboard iso ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : observations ] ) provides both a much better sensitivity ( 0.2  mjy instead of 10  mjy at 12  @xmath3 m ) and a better angular resolution ( a few arcseconds instead of 45 arcsec ) than iras , and thus makes it possible to detect many more faint point sources than it was possible with iras .",
    "the present study aims at monitoring the dust mass loss as a function of luminosity along the rgb and agb in 47 tuc .",
    "relatively warm dust is easily detected from the flux excess that it produces at 12 @xmath3 m .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , whitelock et al .",
    "1994 , le bertre & winters 1998 , jorissen & knapp 1998 ) have shown that there is a tight correlation ( at least for oxygen - rich stars in the solar neighbourhood ) between the mass loss rate and the @xmath22 $ ] color index , which may thus be used to trace the dust mass loss .",
    "another objective of the present study is to detect possible dust - enshrouded stars with no optical counterparts , as found by tanab et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1999 ) in globular clusters from the magellanic clouds .",
    "mosaic images of 5 fields at different distances from the center of the 47 tuc cluster have been obtained with the isocam camera on board iso ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for descriptions of iso and isocam respectively ) , using the lw10 filter ( closely matching the iras 12@xmath3 m filter ) .",
    "the field positions have been chosen so as to survey most of the red variable stars in 47 tuc .",
    "the astronomical observation template ( aot ) parameters for each of the fields are given in table  [ tab : aot ] .",
    "they were adjusted so as to detect sources as faint as possible without saturating on the brightest sources .",
    "these contradictory requirements made us select a number @xmath23 of elementary integrations as large as possible ( namely @xmath24 , to keep within the total allocated time ) but with short integration times ( @xmath25  sec ) and low gain ( @xmath26 ) . with this setup ,",
    "the detector saturates for fluxes of the order of 0.8  jy / pixel , and remains linear up to about 0.3  jy / pixel .",
    "the pixel field of view was taken equal to either @xmath27 ( with the large field mirror ) for the fields closest to the core , or @xmath28 for fields farther out .",
    "the step size between two successive pointings of the mosaic was half the chip size ( in either direction ) , i.e. , @xmath29 for the @xmath28 pixel field of view or @xmath30 for the @xmath27 pixel field of view , to ensure 4 independent detections of the sources in the central region of the mosaic .",
    "the total integration time per source is therefore @xmath31 .",
    "the very center of the cluster has not been observed to avoid saturation and crowding problems .",

    "the default dark frame is first subtracted from the raw data ( cier files ) using the cam interactive analysis ( cia ) package ( ott et al .",

    "remaining long - term drifts ( mainly due to the detector memory effect after passing on bright sources , and to the change of the isocam configuration at the beginning of the observation ) are suppressed by subtracting the baseline of each pixel s time history , obtained from the sequence of all the individual images .",
    "the flat field is constructed from the median of the data themselves , since in the best cases , about 800 ( @xmath44 ) readouts are available per pixel .",
    "the detector transient is corrected by the ` inverse method ' developed by abergel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in the present analysis ,",
    "the fluctuations arising on top of the bright sources ( probably caused by the jitter of the satellite ) are often confused with short- term cosmic rays and unduly masked , resulting in a loss of useful readings for bright sources .",
    "this problem could possibly lead to underestimating the flux of bright sources , but the effect - if present - does not appear to be very severe , as will be seen from a comparison of our isocam fluxes with previous iras measurements of the same sources ( see table  [ tab : irasiso ] ) .",
    "the individual mosaic frames are then coadded into a single image .",
    "the source detection is performed on that image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) using a wavelet transform , which detects at each scale all pixels of the image above a given threshold @xmath43 of the noise map ( starck et al .",
    "1999 ) . a good compromise between maximum sensitivity and minimum number of false detections (",
    "as compared to optical sources ; see sect .",

    "more details about the criteria of inclusion of sources in the final source list are provided in sect .",
    "[ sect : list ] .",
    "the source fluxes are obtained by aperture photometry on the reduced image .",
    "the aperture used includes 12 pixels , and is the sum of the 3 @xmath39 3-pixels square centered on the source , plus 4 pixels exterior to this square and located in the middle of each side of the square .",
    "the measured values were then multiplied by the factors 100/72 ( for the fields observed with a @xmath27 pixel field - of - view ; see table  [ tab : aot ] ) or 100/84.5 ( for the fields observed with the @xmath28 pixel field - of - view ) to account for the point - spread - function ( psf ) wing not falling on the selected aperture . those factors were computed from the observed psf provided by okumura ( isocam psf report , 04/nov/1998 , available on the isocam page + http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es/users/expl_lib/cam_list.html ) .",
    "the measured adus are converted to jansky units using the conversion factor provided by the cia software package ( 4.129  adu / sec / mjy / pix ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the 12  @xmath3 m  flux is the quadratic average of the poisson noise on the signal , and of the uncertainty associated with the psf correction ( 3% ) .    because the reduction process is an intricated one implying many different steps , it is interesting to compare the isocam fluxes with previous results obtained by gillett et al .",
    "( 1988 ) from pointed iras observations of 47  tuc ( table  [ tab : irasiso ] ) .",
    "the 12  @xmath3 m iras and isocam fluxes generally agree within 25% , which is satisfactory considering the fact that the filters are not identical and that some of the lpv sources may be variable at 12  @xmath3 m as well .",
    "the largest deviations are obtained for the composite source v11+v18 ( 18% ) , and for v13 ( 31% ) .",
    "the 12  @xmath3 m  flux of v13 is not reliable , as the isocam image of v13 is in fact a blend of 3 different stars that are seen separately on the _ digital sky survey _ image ( sect .  [ sect : optical ] ) .",
    "another discrepancy concerns v7 , which does not seem to have been detected by gillett et al .",
    "this non - detection is surprising , since its flux at the time of our isocam observation is similar to that of v15 which was detected by gillett et al .",
    "a possible explanation would be that v7 was much fainter in the 12  @xmath3 m  band at the time of the iras observation .",
    "this seems unlikely , however , since the isocam flux for v7 agrees with the prediction for a dust - free photosphere ( see fig .  [",

    "schrder et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that agb stars with masses lower than 1.1  m@xmath12  never reach large enough luminosities to drive a dust - induced superwind , and thus have no chance to become dust - enshrouded .",
    "finally , the luminosity function of obscured agb stars in the field of the lmc rises steeply at @xmath65  @xmath71 ( van loon et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is about where the agb ends in 47  tuc ( frogel et al .",
    "therefore , all available evidence points towards the low turnoff mass of 47 tuc as being the main cause for its lack of dust - enshrouded stars , due to the absence of a superwind phase in low - mass agb stars .",
    "as indicated in sect .  1 , the ratio @xmath40 of the 12 to 2 @xmath3 m fluxes is expected to be a good indicator of dust mass loss .",

    "( 1992 ) and bessell et al .",
    "models of solar metallicity have been used , as only those are available over the whole temperature range covered by the observed stars . nevertheless , a comparison between @xmath40 ratios obtained from ( @xmath15= 3800  k , @xmath72 ) models of [ fe / h ] = 0 and @xmath73 ( yielding @xmath74 and 0.045 , respectively ) reveals that metallicity has a negligible impact on the @xmath40 ratio ( at least for those model stars with no mass loss ) .",
    "the @xmath40 ratio for most of the stars is thus consistent with the value predicted for dust - free photospheres ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f12f2 ] ) . only the bright lpv star v3 ( the only mira in fig .",

    ". a marginal excess may be present as well for the irregular variable v11 .",
    "the exact value of the excess is , however , difficult to assess for v3 , as this mira variable exhibits 0.5-mag variations in the @xmath46 band ( frogel et al .",
    "1981 ) , and very likely varies as well in the 12  @xmath3mbandm iras fluxes by factors as large as 1.6 have been reported by jorissen & knapp ( 1998 ) for some s - type mira variables .",

    "the @xmath40 ratio of v3 should therefore ideally be derived from 2 and 12  @xmath3 m  fluxes obtained at the same epoch , which is unfortunately not the case for the value displayed in fig .",

    "the 12@xmath3 m excess observed for v18 is more surprising ( there is no doubt about its reality as may be assessed from fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) , especially when compared to the absence of a similar excess for the stars v7 and v15 , which are located slightly above v18 on the giant branch . the origin of the difference between the @xmath40 ratios of variable stars of comparable luminosities",
    "must probably be searched for in their variability properties .",
    "both v11 and v18 are noteworthy in that respect . fox ( 1982 )",
    "notes that the irregular variable v11 possibly changed its period ( and pulsation mode ? ) from about 100  d at the time of lloyd evans observations ( lloyd evans 1974 ) to 52  d about 10  y later .",
    "similarly , fox ( 1982 ) suggests that v18 may be of the type of variable that switches on and off intermittently . in the same vein ,",
    "tucholke ( 1992 ) lists two different @xmath54 magnitudes for v18 ( @xmath77 and 13.5 for entries 2197 and 2198 , respectively , which have exactly the same coordinates ) ; they probably indicate that strong variations occurred over the time span covered by tucholke s plates",
    ". it would be tempting to relate this behaviour with the sudden ejection of dust shells causing the star to brighten up at 12  @xmath3 m .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been proposed for semi - regular variable stars by ivezi & knapp ( 1999 ) .",
    "note that the large @xmath40 ratio of v18 can not be ascribed to variations in the @xmath46 band , since the @xmath5 magnitude estimated from the raw denis frame magnitudes from frogel et al .",

    "amounts to 7.33 , as compared to 7.41 from the _ two micron all sky survey _ ( skrutskie 1997 ) and 7.44 obtained almost 20  y earlier by frogel et al .",
    "despite the fact that v28 is also suspected by fox ( 1982 ) of being an intermittent variable , this variable star does _ not _ , however , show large excesses at 12  @xmath3 m   ( @xmath78 with @xmath79 from fox 1982 )",

    "in fact , this relationship applies to solar - metallicity stars and to the regime of dust - driven winds , when the dust is abundant enough to couple to the gas . neither condition is satisfied for the lpvs in 47 tuc .",
