    "when performing electrical measurements , the signal to noise ratio can usually be improved by simply increasing the currents or voltages . in low - temperature experiments ,",
    "this procedure is problematic because of joule heating , which can affect the temperature of the circuit under investigation or the temperature of resistors on bias lines , leading to excess noise .",
    "particularly critical is the situation in the sub - kelvin range , because the temperature of the electrons decouples from the lattice temperature@xcite .",
    "a very conservative , wide - spread rule of thumb among experimentalists is that the voltage @xmath0 across the small conductors should not exceed @xmath1 with @xmath2 the lattice ( phonon ) temperature .",
    "in contrast , macroscopic components , like commercial resistors , are believed to be immune to electron heating .",
    "in fact , the first rule is severe , and the second assertion is often incorrect .",
    "the goal of the present article is to provide the experimental physicist with easy evaluation tools of heating effects , in order to optimize experiments .",
    "the important parameters are the voltage @xmath3 the resistance @xmath4 the lattice temperature @xmath5 the resistor volume @xmath6 and a parameter @xmath7 that describes electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the first step is to calculate the characteristic temperature @xmath8 , which is the temperature that the electrons would reach if cooling would occur only through the coupling to a bath of zero - temperature phonons : @xmath9 the average electron temperature can then be directly read from fig.[b ] , the central result of this work , in which the voltage @xmath0 , the average temperature @xmath10 and the lattice temperature @xmath2 are all expressed in units of @xmath11 in the section iia , we explain how this result is obtained , and give analytical expressions in various limits .",
    "the results are used to calculate the second and third cumulant of the current noise produced by the resistor ( section iib , fig.[c ] ) .",
    "numerical applications are carried out explicitely in section iic , showing in particular that heating in commercial resistors can be important . in section iii , we address time - dependent situations , and calculate how fast electrons heat up in a resistor when a current is applied , and how fast they cool down when the current is switched off . for small voltages ( @xmath12 ) , the variations of temperature in both transients is exponential , with the diffusion time @xmath13 across the whole conductor as a characteristic time ( see fig.@xmath14[d ] ) . in the opposite limit ( @xmath15 ) , heating is exponential , but cooling proceeds very slowly , with a powerlaw dependence ( see fig.[e ] ) .",
    "the timescale is the electron - phonon scattering time @xmath16 at temperature @xmath17 defined by eq.([taueph ] ) . as a numerical application",
    ", we consider in section iiic a situation where repeated current pulses are applied to a resistor , and compute the time - dependence of the electron temperature ( fig.[f ] ) .",
    "when a voltage @xmath0 is applied to a two - terminal resistor ( see top of fig.[a ] ) , the joule power @xmath18 is delivered to the electrons .",
    "this power can dissipate by two mechanisms : the first one , which dominates at room temperature or in macroscopic resistors , is phonon emission .",
    "it follows , at temperatures well below the debye temperature , a @xmath19 dependence , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the local electron temperature , @xmath2 the phonon temperature@xcite .",
    "the second mechanism is the simple diffusion of the energetic electrons out of the resistor . the energy is then dissipated in the connecting leads , which are , in typical situations , large and low - resistive .",
    "the balance between the joule power and the two cooling mechanisms can be expressed in the form of a heat equation@xcite@xmath22 with @xmath23 the position along the resistor in reduced units ( @xmath23 runs from 0 to 1 ) , @xmath24 the lorenz number , @xmath6 the resistor volume , @xmath7 the electron - phonon coupling constant ( typically @xmath25 for good metals @xcite ) .",
    "the left hand side of eq.([heatbrut ] ) accounts for heat transport by electron diffusion , which is expressed by the wiedemann - franz law , stating that the electron thermal conductivity is proportional to the product of the electrical conductivity and the electron temperature .",
    "the following assumptions have been made to write eq.([heatbrut ] ) :    1 .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath21 is assumed to be well defined locally , _",
    "i.e. _ the local electron energy distribution function is a fermi function .",
    "this requires that the thermalization of electrons among themselves ( e.g. by coulomb interaction ) occurs faster than the diffusion of electrons across the resistor@xcite , a condition usually obeyed except for short wires ( length @xmath26 ) made of very pure materials@xcite .",
    "the last term of the equation , which describes cooling by phonons , assumes that the lattice temperature @xmath2 does not depend on the local electron temperature @xmath27 corrections due to the kapitza resistance between the phonons of the resistive film and the substrate could in principle be included@xcite , but their contribution is not essential in practice .",
    "the heat power transfered to phonons was taken proportional to @xmath19 with @xmath28 theoretically , it is predicted that the exponent @xmath29 which is related to a @xmath30 dependence of the electron - phonon scattering rate with electron energy @xmath31 can range from 4 to 6 , depending on the relative sizes of the thermal phonon wavelength and the electron mean free path , on the dimensionality of the phonon system , and on the dynamics of impurities@xcite . in most experiments ,",
    "values close to @xmath32 have been found ( see discussions in refs . ) , therefore our choice .",
    "the calculations can however be easily extended to other values of @xmath29 and the results presented in fig.[b ] apply , with another definition of @xmath17 as discussed in the following .",
    "radiative cooling@xcite , which has a negligible effect in resistors connected to large , non - superconducting contacts@xcite , is neglected .",
    "the heat equation ( [ heatbrut ] ) has to be solved with boundary conditions for @xmath21 at @xmath33 and @xmath34 when the connecting wires to the resistor are low - resistive and very large compared to the resistor , as is the case for macroscopic resistors made of thin and narrow metallic stripes of metal , one can assume @xmath35",
    ". this simple hypothesis will be made in the following . for on - chip thin - film resistors , heating of the contact pads",
    "themselves may however not be negligible@xcite .    before a general solution of eq.([heatbrut ] ) is presented , we recall simple limits .",

    "this temperature is an intrinsic quantity for the resistor , which in particular does not depend on @xmath0 or @xmath48 however , it does not correspond to the electron temperature in any limit , therefore we prefer to take as a reference @xmath8 , keeping in mind that it depends on @xmath49 defining @xmath50 @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , eq.([heatbrut ] ) reads:@xmath55 the temperature profile being symmetric with respect to the middle of the wire , eq.([eqchaleur ] ) needs to be solved for @xmath56 with the boundary conditions @xmath57 and @xmath58 instead of solving this non - linear differential equation with boundary conditions specified at different points , it is convenient to rewrite it in the following integral form:@xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 the value of @xmath62 is obtained by solving eq.([eq chaleur reduite ] ) for @xmath63 in the left panel of fig.[a ] , the temperature profile along the resistor is given for @xmath64 and 30 , assuming @xmath65 .  at @xmath66",

    "heating of the resistor is thus very important , an effect which hindered the authors of ref . from drawing clear - cut conclusions from coulomb blockade measurements at finite voltage .",

    "we show how this heating is limited when pulses are used instead of static voltages .",
    "the case of a constant voltage @xmath0 across the resistor , which was investigated above , can be extended to the case of slowly varying voltages directly . however , when @xmath0 changes on timescales shorter than the diffusion time or than the electron - phonon scattering time@xcite ( see below ) , the previous results can not be used to calculate instantaneous temperatures .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath192 and how a resitor cools down when the voltage is set to zero at @xmath191 _ i.e. _ @xmath193 . here , @xmath194 is the heaviside function ( @xmath195 for @xmath196 1 for @xmath197 . these situations also allow to describe experiments in which current or voltage pulses are used like , for example , when measuring the switching rate of josephson junctions@xcite . understanding how the pulse characteristics can reduce the noise in such measurements is therefore important to design the readout of superconducting q - bits .    when a voltage is applied , the linear drop of the electrical potential , which results from the collective charge modes , establishes after an @xmath198 time , where the capacitance @xmath199 is the capacitance of the wire to ground .",
    "this time is generally much shorter than the time necessary to build up the temperature profile , which involves diffusion of individual electrons .",
    "hence , we consider here that joule heating is homogeneous as soon as a voltage is applied .",
    "when @xmath66 the temperature profile is entirely determined by the temperature at the ends of the resistor , therefore a steady - state regime is reached only when the electrons have diffused across the whole resistor and the characteristic time is the diffusion time @xmath13 . if @xmath200 the transient is shorter because , apart from very close to the ends , the temperature is mostly determined by a local equilibrium between joule heating and phonon emission .",
    "we now treat quantitatively these two limits@xmath42      if @xmath66 @xmath201 even when the stationary regime is reached , and eq.([heat equation with time ] ) reduces to @xmath202 as shown in section iia , the proper energy scale when @xmath203 is @xmath204 and the solution of eq.([timedep ] ) that satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath205 reads@xmath206  with @xmath207 solution of @xmath208 in the case where @xmath192 heating is then given by @xmath209 and in the case @xmath210 cooling from the profile ( [ hot ] ) follows @xmath211 corresponding temperature profiles at various times are plotted in the top panels of fig.[d ] assuming @xmath65 , whereas the time evolution of the average temperature @xmath10 is plotted in the bottom panels . at very short times , the average temperature grows as @xmath212 at @xmath213 a better approximation is @xmath214 which can not be distinguished from the exact solution in fig.@xmath14[d]@xmath42 at @xmath215 the asymptotical temperature profile given by eq.([heatbrut ] ) is essentially established .",
    "conversely , after the voltage is turned off , the temperature decay is well approximated ( within the line width in fig.@xmath14[d ] ) by@xmath216 hence , in the low - voltage regime , heating and cooling occur exponentially , and the timescale is the diffusion time @xmath217 in the example of the @xmath218 commercial resistor in section iib , @xmath219 for metallic wires made of pure materials@xcite with an elastic mean free path of the order of 40@xmath220/s , @xmath221 for a length @xmath222     ( bottom panels ) in the limit @xmath223 for @xmath224 left panels : heating sequence of the resistor when @xmath225 ( as shown in inset ) ; right panels : cooling sequence of the resistor when @xmath226 ( as shown in inset ) .",
