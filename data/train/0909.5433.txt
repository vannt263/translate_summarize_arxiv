    "the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model is a spin-1 model which presents a rich variety of critical and multicritical phenomena @xcite .",
    "this model has been used to describe systems characterized by three states per spin , and it was originally introduced to describe the phase separation and superfluidity in the @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures .",
    "the beg model can also describe the properties of a variety of systems ranging from spin-1 magnets to liquid crystal mixtures , semiconductor alloys , microemulsions , to quote a few .",
    "the spin-1 beg model is characterized by a bilinear ( @xmath2 ) and biquadratic ( @xmath3 ) nearest - neighbor pair interactions and a single - ion potential ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the one - dimensional case for the beg model was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where exact renormalization - group recursion relations were derived , exhibiting tricritical and critical fixed points .",
    "the underlying idea of this paper is to provide a new and general framework to exactly investigate the one - dimensional beg model in the whole parameters space . for one - dimensional lattices , or more generally for lattices with no closed loops , classical fermionic and spin systems",
    "can be easily solved by means of the transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the partition function of a 1d model of a classical spin-1 system with nearest - neighbor interactions can be calculated from the largest eigenvalue of a @xmath5 matrix . however , this method is hardy implementable when more complex lattices are considered .",
    "the onsager solution for the two - dimensional ising model is an emblematic example @xcite .",
    "thus , there is the necessity to foster alternative methods which can be used for a large class of lattices .",
    "recently , it has been shown that , upon transforming to fermionic variables , spin systems can be conveniently studied by means of quantum field methods , namely : green s functions and equations of motion methods @xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage of offering a general formulation for any dimension and to provide a rigorous determination of a complete set of eigenoperators of the hamiltonian and , correspondingly , of the set of elementary excitations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , i would like to further develop our previous work @xcite , where the finite temperature phase diagrams of the one - dimensional beg model with vanishing biquadratic exchange have been obtained , by extending it to a more general situation with a finite biquadratic interaction .",
    "secondly , the beg model exhibits interesting features when one considers a non - zero biquadratic coupling , such as the breakdown of magnetic plateaus .",
    "here , i address the problem of determining the effect on the behavior of thermodynamic quantities of the presence of a finite biquadratic interaction .",
    "i study the properties of the system as functions of the external parameters @xmath2 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 allowing for the biquadratic interaction @xmath3 to be both repulsive and attractive .",
    "the beg model consists of a system with three states per spin . for nearest - neighbor interaction ,",
    "the one - dimensional beg model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where the spin variable @xmath9 takes the values @xmath10 .",
    "i use the heisenberg picture : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 stands for the lattice vector @xmath13 .",
    "this model can be mapped , in two steps , into a fermionic model : namely , the hubbard model ( in the limit of zero bandwidth ) with local interaction @xmath14 and extended to include intersite , charge - charge , charge - double occupancy and double occupancy - double occupancy interactions @xcite .",
    "firstly , by means of the transformation @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the density number operator of a fermionic system .",
    "@xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of fermionic field in the spinor notation and satisfies canonical anti - commutation relations . secondly , by taking into account the four possible values of the particle density ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , one redefines the chemical potential as @xmath23 and the on - site potential as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "i refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis of the mapping between the extended hubbard model and spin-1 ising model .",
    "once the beg model has been mapped into the fermionic model , the latter can be exactly solved by means of the green s function and equations of motion formalism . upon introducing the hubbard projection operators @xmath26c(i)$ ] , and @xmath27",
    ", one can define composite multiplet operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 which are eigenoperators of the fermionic hamiltonian with eigenenergies @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "an exact solution of the hamiltonian can be formally obtained . within this framework ,",
    "the retarded green s function and pertinent correlation functions turn out to be functions of only two parameters , in terms of which one may find a solution of the model .",
    "i refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for computational details .",
    "by exploiting the general formulation sketched in the previous section , i shall now study the magnetic properties of the 1d beg model , by restricting the analysis to the case @xmath32 . in the following",
    ", i set @xmath33 and i consider only positive values of @xmath7 , owing to the symmetry property of the model under the transformation @xmath34 and @xmath35 . when @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the ground state is purely antiferromagnetic for @xmath38 . by varying the magnetic field ,",

    ", one observes three plateaus at @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the intermediate phase between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic ones has a width depending on @xmath4 , whose endpoints are denoted by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , i.e. , starting point of a nonzero magnetization and saturated field , respectively . for finite biquadratic interaction ,",
    "the presence of plateaus in the magnetization curve dramatically depends on the sign of the interaction itself and on the value of the anisotropy .    in fig .",

    "half lies in the transverse plane . in the intermediate region , according to the strength of the biquadratic coupling , one observes one , two or three plateaus .",

    ", one observes the decrease of @xmath51 , which eventually vanishes for sufficiently large @xmath3 : the spins are all polarized in the @xmath7 direction as soon as the magnetic field is turned on .",
