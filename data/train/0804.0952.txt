    "elements heavier than the iron group are mostly synthesized by neutron - capture processes , which are distinguished into the rapid ( r- ) and slow ( s- ) processes by the reaction time scale ( e.g. burbidge et al . 1957 ) .",
    "the s - process fraction in solar - system material is estimated by the classical or stellar s - process models calibrated for the nuclei that are yielded only by the s - process ( e.g. kppeler et al . 1989 , arlandini et al .",
    "the r - process component is derived by subtracting the s - process one from the solar - system isotopic abundances .",
    "the contributions of the s- and r - processes to galactic objects are estimated from the abundance ratios of elements that represent the two processes ( e.g. ba / eu , la / eu ; truran et al .",
    "1981 ; mcwilliam et al . 1998 ; burris et al . 2000 ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the la / eu ratio for a large sample of metal - poor stars , and concluded that the contribution of the s - process , with respect to the r - process , increases with increasing metallicity , but large scatter of [ la / eu ] exists among stars having similar metallicity = @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for elements a and b. ] .",
    "another good probe of the s - process at low metallicity is pb , one of the heaviest elements including the isotope with magic numbers for proton and neutron ( @xmath6pb ) .",
    "the pb abundances have been measured for many carbon - enhanced objects , which are believed to be affected by mass transfer across binary systems from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , and have been providing a useful constraint on the s - process in low metallicity agb stars .",
    "in contrast , measurements of pb abundances for normal ( non - carbon - enhanced ) stars are quite limited .",
    "@xcite argued enrichment of pb in the galactic halo , thick and thin disks , reporting the pb abundances for several stars .",
    "their sample , however , includes a star possibly classified as a ch star , and the results for some objects are quite uncertain .",
    "@xcite studied the heavy elements , including pb , for hd  221170 ( [ fe / h]@xmath7 ) in detail .",
    "pb abundances of stars in globular clusters were recently determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this letter reports our abundance measurements of pb and other elements for bright metal - poor red giants , which would belong to the galactic halo .",
    "the results are compared with the solar - system s- and r - process abundance ratios as well as that of r - process - enhanced , extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "the sample of this study is selected from the list of @xcite , who determined abundances of neutron - capture elements like la and eu , and that of @xcite , who studied metallicity and kinematics of metal - poor stars .",
