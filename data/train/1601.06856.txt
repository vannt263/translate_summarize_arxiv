    "toluene ( c@xmath1h@xmath2ch@xmath3 ) , or methyl - benzene , is the simplest alkyl - substituted benzene derivative , in which a methyl group replaces one of the hydrogen atoms of the benzene ( c@xmath1h@xmath1 ) molecule .",
    "although these species have not yet been detected in the interstellar medium , its protonated version ( c@xmath4h@xmath5 ) has a spectral signature that matches reasonably with the unidentified interstellar infrared emission band near 6.2 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mechanisms of formation and the role of the molecule in astrophysical environments and in the combustion chemistry have attracted considerable attention in the last years ( dagaut et al .",
    "2002 ; imanaka & smith 2007 ; silva et al . 2007 ;",
    "dangi et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "toluene was firstly identified as one of the major constituents of the murchison and allende meteorites @xcite . a catalytic combination of co , h@xmath6 and nh@xmath3 on the surface of dust grains - a process known as fischer - tropsch - type reaction - is attributed as the main formation route of toluene and the meteorite organic matter @xcite .",
    "toluene is also considered a critical building block for the formation of methyl - substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( thomas & wornat 2008 ; ricks et al .",
    "2009 ) , which has been proposed as the carriers of the 3.4 @xmath0 m emission in astrophysical environments .",
    "it is well known that the formation of pahs and their methyl derivatives occurs mainly in the dust shells of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , which after the ejection of its carbon - rich envelope into the interstellar medium become protoplanetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "in fact , the infrared emission features that prevail over the spectra of most galactic and extragalactic sources are carried by these molecules @xcite .    concerning the astrophysical synthesis of methylated benzene , different routes of formation",
    "are proposed in the literature , but yet no consensus was reached .",
    "tokmakov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , combining experimental measurements and theoretical methods , investigated the reaction of the phenyl radical ( c@xmath1h@xmath2 ) with methane , and concluded that this route does not lead preferentially to toluene , but mainly to benzene and ch@xmath3 .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the gas phase synthesis of toluene from the ethynyl radical ( c@xmath6h ) with isoprene ( 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene , c@xmath2h@xmath7 ) - two neutral , non - cyclic precursors - has no entrance barrier and all the transition states have energy lower than the separated reactants .",
    "consequently , it is a viable reaction pathway in low - temperature environments , such as the cold molecular cloud tmc-1 .",
    "another possible route of formation of interstellar toluene is the reaction of o - benzyne ( c@xmath1h@xmath8 ) with methane , but to the best of our knowledge this reaction was neither experimentally nor theoretically studied .",
    "ziegler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed that the formation process of toluene in the gas - phase could take place in the warm layers of the circumstellar envelope of agb stars , involving the reaction of benzyl with h and l - c@xmath9h@xmath9 with c@xmath10h@xmath11 .",
    "the object t dra is a carbon - rich agb star associated with fuv and x - ray emission .",
    "the origin of the x - ray emission in the environment of the star , however , is still a matter of debate .",
    "it was proposed that the presence of a white dwarf as a companion , in a binary system , could be responsible for the observable x - ray flux @xcite . however , more observations are necessary to constrain the intensity and periodicity of these events in t dra and other agb stars , as well as the role in its inner shell . nevertheless , the presence of a companion star should not be considered surprising , since it has been proposed for well - studied evolved stars , such as irc + 10216 and the pre - planetary nebula crl 618 @xcite .",
    "the present work obtained experimental and theoretical information about the photoionization and photodissociation processes of toluene upon interaction with soft x - ray photons at energies in the vicinity of the carbon k shell .",
    "particular attention was given to the analysis of doubly charged species , inasmuch as the presence of multiply - charged pahs in the interstellar medium has been proposed @xcite .",
    "since the chemistry of circumstellar regions is strongly affected by x - rays photons associated with high velocity winds and with shocked gas in a binary companion , the investigation of the photo - interaction is of great interest for unravelling the behavior of molecules in these environments . here",
    ", the emphasis is placed on the environment of the agb stellar object t dra , and the spotlight of the work is directed to determine the ionization , destruction , and the half - life of toluene under the observed astrophysical conditions of the star .",
    "we expect that our results will open a discussion towards the presence of ion - molecule reactions and the structure of molecules in different charged states in the circumstellar envelope of agb stars .    in the following section , we briefly present the experimental and theoretical methods used in this work .",
    "section 3 contains the results and discussion . in the last section ,",
    "final remarks and conclusions are presented .",
    "the measurements were performed at the brazilian synchrotron light source laboratory ( lnls ) using soft x - rays photons selected from the spherical grating mono - chromator ( sgm ) at energies around the c1s resonance ( 280 - 320 ev ) .",
    "the experimental set - up has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , soft x - ray photons , at a rate of  10@xmath12 photons s@xmath13 , perpendicularly intersect the gas sample inside a high vacuum chamber .",
    "the photons absorbed by the molecules produce the excitation and ionization of electrons from inner shell , causing a molecular instability that can lead to the dissociation , producing several ionized fragments .",
    "the base pressure in the vacuum chamber was maintained in the 10@xmath14 torr range , while during operation the chamber pressure was raised up to 10@xmath15 torr .",
    "the gas needle was kept at ground potential .",
    "the emerging photon beam was recorded by a light sensitive diode .",
    "the sample was purchased commercially from sigma - aldrich with purity better than 99.5% .",
    "no further purification was used except for degassing the liquid sample by multiple freeze - pump - thaw cycles before admitting the vapor into the chamber . since toluene possesses a high vapor pressure",
    ", there was no need to heat the liquid sample , avoiding degradation .",
    "the photoelectrons ( pe ) and photoions ( pi ) produced by the interaction with the photon beam were extracted by a static electric field of 450 v / cm .",
    "the ionized fragments were accelerated and focused by a two - stage electric field into a field free drift tube 297 mm long and detected by micro - channel plate detector in a chevron configuration .",
    "the ionic species were mass - to - charge ( m / z ) analyzed by a time - of - flight mass spectrometer ( tof - ms ) , and produced the stop signals delivered to a time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) .",
    "the photoelectrons were directed into the opposite direction towards a micro - channel plate detector .",
    "the tdc was started by one of the collected electrons .",
    "standard time - of - flight spectra were obtained using the correlation between one photoelectron and a photoion in coincidence ( pepico ) .",
    "in addition to the pepico spectra , two - dimensional coincidence mass spectra ( pe2pico : photo - electron photo - ion photo - ion coincidence ) were simultaneously obtained . in this case",
    ", the ion pairs resulted from the multiple ionization events , mostly associated with the auger - like process , that after decay break into at least two ionic and neutral species . only about 0.6% of all coincidence signals",
    "were sorted in the pe2pico spectra , reflecting that the majority of the contribution was correlated to single coincidence events .    in order to extract astrochemical informations",
    "it is essential to obtain the absolute ionization and fragmentation cross sections .",
    "the data reduction procedure included subtraction of a linear background and the false coincidences coming from aborted double and triple ionization events @xcite .",
    "then , contributions of all cationic fragments were summed up and normalized to the photoabsorption cross sections measured by ishii & hitchcock ( 1987 ) . assuming a negligible fluorescence yield due to the low carbon atomic number @xcite and an ionic fragment production in the present photon energy range , it is possible to consider that all absorbed photons lead to cation formation .",
    "inner shell photoabsorption and the subsequent photoionization process may produce instabilities on the molecular structure ( nuclear rearrangements ) , producing a transient molecule that breaks down following different dissociation pathways .",
    "mass - spectra of toluene were obtained around the energy of the resonance c1s @xmath16 @xcite between 277.9 and 302.7 ev .",
    "density functional calculations were performed to elucidate the most stable molecular structures of the doubly ionized species obtained in the x - rays photodissociation measurements .",
    "these ions are of type c@xmath4h@xmath17 , n=2 - 8 .",
    "around 70 initial geometries for each dication were optimized at the m06 - 2x / cc - pvtz(-f ) level ( zhao & truhlar 2008 ) .",
    "frequency calculations and thermodynamic analysis were performed for the 15 most stable structures of each species , and more than 100 different minimum structures were characterized .",
    "considering this large number , the structural and thermodynamic aspects were discussed solely on the basis of the most stable c@xmath4h@xmath17 species , at the mentioned level of theory .",
    "the low - lying isomers of each c@xmath4h@xmath17 dication will be discussed in a future work . moreover ,",
    "the thermodynamics of several dissociation pathways of the dications by coulombic decay were evaluated , and compared to the estimated coincidence of the monocation products from the pe2pico analysis .",
    "all calculations were performed with the jaguar 7.9 program .",
    "the radiative flux model of t dra was constructed by using the numerical simulations of wind accretion in symbiotic binary systems developed by val - borro et al .",
    "the authors estimated an x - ray luminosity due to mass accretion of the wind of an agb star onto a small companion ( r=0.02 r@xmath18 ) , between distances of 16 to 70 au , in the range between 3@xmath1910@xmath20 and 3@xmath1910@xmath21 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "this scenario was applied to obtain the photoionization and photodissociation rates of toluene , as well as the photoproduction of dications , as functions of the distance from the agb star .",
    "figure [ spec285 ] shows the mass spectra of toluene at the c1s resonance energy ( 285.1 ev ) . besides the c@xmath22 group ( 84 to 93 amu ) , the following ionic groups were identified , due to carbon atom loss : methyl ( 12 to 16 amu ) , c@xmath23 ( 24 to 28 amu ) , c@xmath9 ( 36 to 41 amu ) , c@xmath10 ( 48 to 53 amu ) , c@xmath11 ( 60 to 66 amu ) , and c@xmath24 ( 73 to 78 amu ) .",
    "moreover , the appearance of fractional m / z from 42 to 47 amu suggests that doubly ionized molecules from the c@xmath22 group were also produced .",
    "the region of the spectra corresponding to the double ionized molecules from the c7 group , of special interest in this work , is enhanced in figure [ spec285 ] , and the fragment - ions assignments highlighted .",
    "it should be mentioned that such a full sequence of doubly ionized molecules is not usually encountered and easily identified in homo and heterocyclic ring molecules .",
    "small features at masses ( m / z ) 20 , 38.5 and 39.5 , corresponding to the ions c@xmath9h@xmath25 , c@xmath24h@xmath26 and c@xmath24h@xmath27 , were also identified . small doubly charged molecules , in general , are metastable : charge separation may occur and the fragments are accelerated by their mutual repulsive character ( coulomb explosion ) .",
    "it is well established , however , that aromatic molecules resist coulomb explosion better than other molecules @xcite .",
    "even though the discrimination of doubly charged ions in mass spectra can be difficult or even impossible , they are very easily identified in the mass spectra of toluene .",
    "shaw et al ( 1998 ) reported the appearance of the ion c@xmath22h@xmath28 with ionization by photons of energy 23.8 ev .",
    "the peaks of the double ionized fragments in our mass - spectra present a narrower profile than those for small single ionized fragments , which reflects the thermal energy of the ions .",
    "doubly ionized peaks of c@xmath22h@xmath29 , with n = 2 - 8 , were also produced from the fragmentation of toluene with the impact of 100 ev electrons ( guch et al .",

    "( 2015 ) studied the production and stability of dications of coronene from x - ray photon interaction with cations .",

    "following the equations of glassgold ( 1996 ) for a spherical symmetry and a uniform gas expansion , with column density @xmath92 r@xmath13 , the distance between the agb star and the small companion that results in a column density of 4.0@xmath1910@xmath90 @xmath91 observed from earth should be @xmath93 45 au . the x - ray flux , @xmath94 , attenuated while it penetrates the gas envelope , is given by :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the distance from the companion , and @xmath97 is the optical depth :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the total x - ray photoabsorption cross - section by gas in the interstellar medium , and n@xmath100 is the hydrogen column density .",
    "considering the photon flux in the vicinity of the c1s resonance energy obtained from draine @xmath101 tan ( 2003 ) , we evaluate that @xmath99 is @xmath93 2.3@xmath1910@xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "the n@xmath100 value at a given distance from the agb s companion was obtained using the equation ( 2 ) of glassgold ( 1996 ) :    @xmath104 \\texttt{cm}^{-2},\\ ] ]    where d is the distance between the stars and r@xmath105 is the distance from the agb star .        with these parameters",
    ", we can evaluate the rates of photodissociation , ionization and half - life of toluene , besides the production of double charged ions through the t dra envelope that faces the companion star .",
    "the dissociation of a given molecule subjected to a radiation field is given by :    @xmath106    where the photodissociation rate , @xmath107 , is defined as :    @xmath108    on the other hand , the photoionization rate is given by : @xmath109    and the rate of dications production is : @xmath110    the results are shown in the figure [ fig : iondiss ] .",
    "the photoionization , photodissociation and photoproduction of dications drops sharply in the direction of the inner envelope .",
    "a half - life radial profile of toluene can be evaluated from the equation [ phdcs ] , by writing @xmath111 , that gives 10@xmath112 years of half - life at a distance of 3@xmath1910@xmath113 cm ( 21 au ) from the agb star .",
    "further chemical reactions should be inhibited as the shell expands outwards , creating a photodissociation radius determined by the molecular half - life .",
    "the production of molecules is , thus , strongly dependent on the side of the envelope that is facing the companion star in a binary case .",
    "nevertheless , if magnetic activity is present through the envelope , the ions produced by these photochemical reactions may contribute to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "therefore , the structural diversity of the single and double ions would be shared through the envelope within a new network of ion - molecule reactions in the expanding shells of the entire envelope of the agb star , which has not yet been explored by any chemical models .",
    "in this work , the x - ray photoionization and photodissociation of toluene was studied in the vicinity of the carbon k shell resonance energy .",
    "it was shown that the main photodissociation pathways lead to the formation of c@xmath9h@xmath54 , c@xmath9h@xmath55 , c@xmath10h@xmath55 , and c@xmath10h@xmath54 .",
    "moreover , electron - ion coincidences have revealed several doubly charged molecular ions containing seven carbon atoms with considerable abundance .",
    "the relatively high survival of the dications subjected to hard inner shell ionization suggests that they could be observed in the interstellar medium , especially in regions where pahs are detected , and validates their search in astrophysical environments .",
    "the absolute single and double photoionization and photodissociation cross sections were determined .",
    "the particularly high photoabsorption cross section of toluene at the c1s edge increases the photoionization and photodissociation cross sections of the molecule , when compared to benzene .",
    "eventually , this could be responsible for the higher detection of doubly charged species of toluene .",
    "the structure of the c@xmath4h@xmath17 dications was also studied in this work .",
    "it was shown that , while c@xmath4h@xmath66 and c@xmath4h@xmath69 present polyyne - like structures , a cyclic structure containing a planar tetracoordinate carbon is one of the possible global minima of c@xmath4h@xmath70 .",
    "a previously non - reported methyl - biscyclopropenyl structure was found as the global minimum for c@xmath4h@xmath71 , and the loss of structural integrity of c@xmath4h@xmath72 when compared to neutral toluene , as previously suggested in the literature , was confirmed .",
    "the most exoergic dissociation pathways from doubly charged ions are associated with the loss of c - c@xmath3h@xmath76 .",
    "this suggests that the decomposition c@xmath4h@xmath17 dications could contribute to the enhancement of the cyclopropenyl ion in toluene - rich astrophysical environments , such as the upper atmosphere of titan .",
    "finally , the photoionization and photodissociation cross sections obtained in this work were applied to evaluate the half - life of toluene through the t dra envelope , which reaches a value of @xmath9310@xmath112 years at a distance of 21 au from the agb star .",
    "the results also suggest that the ion production on the side of the envelope that faces the companion white dwarf could affect other regions , if magnetic activity is present .",
    "ultimately , this mechanism could trigger ion - molecule reactions through ambipolar diffusion ."
