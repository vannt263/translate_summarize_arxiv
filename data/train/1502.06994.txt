    "different of @xmath140 , the energy surface generated by @xmath142 is conical , but it is not an isotropic cone , generating an anisotropy in the velocity . in this case , with a small energy gap , the electron and hole velocities have only a little variation around @xmath208 , as can be seen in fig . [ velo ] @xmath184 .",
    "increasing @xmath38 , there is a stronger anisotropy , in contrast with @xcite .    the electron and hole velocities for @xmath91 nm and @xmath92 nm at @xmath141 ( @xmath209 mev when @xmath52 ev and @xmath210 mev when @xmath178 mev ) and at the intermediate value between @xmath199 and @xmath200 ( @xmath211 mev when @xmath52 ev and @xmath212 mev when @xmath178 mev ) are plotted respectively in fig .",

    "when @xmath90 the electrons and hole minibands are asymmetric , so the electron and hole velocities are not equal . in fig .",
    "[ velo ] @xmath144 we consider the contact point at @xmath51 .",
    "the behavior of the velocity in this case is very similar with the case with @xmath70 .",
    "the main difference is that the dip has a width slightly different .",

    "it can be seen that the electron and hole velocities are equal at @xmath214 and differ widely for other values of @xmath173 . as in the case with @xmath70 , when @xmath38 increases the anisotropy of the velocity becomes greater .",
    "we have analyzed the electronic structure of a gapped graphene superlattice with a piecewise constant periodic potential using the continuum model based on an effective dirac equation .",
    "we consider that the energy gap is generated by an appropriate substrate , which changes the fermi velocity , as well .",
    "it was shown that the energy gap oscillates when the potential @xmath13 changes continuously at @xmath59 and is zero at discrete values @xmath215 .",
    "when @xmath216 , extra dirac points appear at @xmath105 and never disappear .",
    "thus , beginning with a critical potential @xmath81 , the graphene system becomes gapless . in the special case of equal well and barrier widths ,",
    "these extra dirac points are located in the fermi level and the electron and hole minibands are symmetric , whereas with an unequal well and barrier widths the extra dirac points are no longer at the fermi level and the electron and hole minibands are asymmetric .",
    "we found that if the initial energy gap @xmath1 in graphene is equal to @xmath0 , it is possible to tune the energy gap with a periodic potential in the range @xmath2 .",
    "we found the locations of all contact points and it was shown that the greater the difference between the well and barrier width , the greater the critical potential @xmath64 .",
    "finally , we obtained the dispersion relation in the vicinity of all contact points and used it to find the effective group velocity of the carriers .",
    "the velocity has a strong anisotropy around the contact points and is sensitive to the energy gap .",
