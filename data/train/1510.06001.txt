    "this paper is concerned with new developments of numerical methods for a type of fourth order problem with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the model problem seeks an unknown function @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an open bounded domain in @xmath5(@xmath6 ) with a lipschitz continuous boundary @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the unit outward normal direction to @xmath7 , @xmath9 is a symmetric and positive definite matrix - valued function , @xmath10 is nonnegative real - valued function , and the functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are given in the domain or on its boundary , as appropriate .",
    "for convenience , denote the second order elliptic operator @xmath14 as @xmath15 . for simplicity and without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath9 is piecewise constant matrix and @xmath10 is a piecewise constant .",
    "the fourth order model problem ( [ 0.1 ] ) arises from fluorescence tomograph(ft)@xcite , which is an emerging , in vivo noninvasive 3-d imaging technique .",
    "ft captures molecular specific information by using highly specific fluorescent probes and non - ionizing nir radiation instead of x - ray or other powerful magnetic field @xcite , which makes ft a potentially less harmful medical imaging modality compared to other medical imaging modalities , such as ct and mri .",
    "ft aims to reconstruct the distribution of fluorophores , which are tagged with targetted molecules , from boundary measurements .",
    "therefore , ft has been regarded as a promising method in early cancer detection and drug monitoring nowadays @xcite .",
    "we introduce the following space @xmath16 which is equipped with the following norm @xmath17    a variational formulation for the fourth order model problem ( [ 0.1 ] ) is given by seeking @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 , @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the usual inner product in @xmath23 , and the test space @xmath24 can be defined as @xmath25 here , @xmath8 is the unit outward normal direction to the boundary of @xmath26 .    there have been various conforming finite element schemes proposed for a general fourth order elliptic problem , such as the biharmonic equation , by constructing finite element spaces as subspaces of @xmath27 .",
    "such @xmath0-conforming methods essentially require @xmath28-continuity for the underlying piecewise polynomials ( known as finite element functions ) on a prescribed finite element partition @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28-continuity imposes an enormous difficulty in the construction of the corresponding finite element functions in practical computations due to the fact that the @xmath28-continuous elements have high degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the argyris element has 21 degrees of freedom , and the bell element has 18 degrees of freedom .",
    "because of the complexity in the construction of @xmath28-continuous elements , @xmath0-conforming finite element methods are rarely used in practice for solving the biharmonic equation . as an alternative approach , nonconforming and discontinuous galerkin",
    "finite element methods have been developed for solving the biharmonic equation over the last several decades .",
    "the morley element @xcite is a well - known example of nonconforming element for the biharmonic equation by using piecewise quadratic polynomials .",
    "recently , a @xmath29 interior penalty method was studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a hp - version interior - penalty discontinuous galerkin method was developed for the biharmonic equation . to avoid the use of @xmath28-elements , mixed methods",
    "have been developed for the biharmonic equation by reducing the fourth order problem to a system of two second order equations @xcite .",
    "the difference between ( [ 0.2 ] ) and the standard bi - harmonic equation is significant .",
    "first , the usual @xmath0 conforming elements designed for the bi - harmonic equation are no longer @xmath30-conforming , and thus are not applicable to the problem ( [ 0.2 ] ) . for some well - known non - conforming finite elements , such as the morley element @xcite , for the biharmonic equation , the corresponding variational formulation involves the full hessian .",
    "since it is not clear if the problem ( [ 0.2 ] ) can be re - formulated in an equivalent form , the applicability of such non - conforming finite elements is highly questionable .",
    "in fact , we believe that they can not be directly applicable to the problem ( [ 0.2 ] ) . the problem ( [ 0.2 ] ) can also be formulated in a mixed form by using an auxiliary variable @xmath31 .",
    "the exact mixed formulation seeks @xmath32 such that @xmath33 and satisfying @xmath34 most of the existing finite element methods are applicable to the mixed formulation ( [ bi - e - mixed ] ) .",
    "one drawback with the mixed formulation is the saddle - point nature of the problem , which causes extra difficulty in the design of fast solution techniques for the corresponding discretizations .",
    "recently , weak galerkin ( wg ) finite element method is a new and efficient numerical method for solving partial differential equations .",
    "the method / idea was first proposed by junping wang and xiu ye in 2011 for solving second order elliptic problem in @xcite , and the concept was further developed in @xcite .",
    "the central idea of wg is to interpret partial differential operators as generalized distributions , called weak differential operators , over the space of discontinuous functions including boundary information .",
    "the weak differential operators are further discretized and applied to the corresponding variational formulations of the underlying pdes . by design ,",
    "wg uses generalized and/or discontinuous approximating functions on general meshes to overcome the barrier in the construction of `` smooth '' finite element functions .",
    "the current research indicates that the concept of discrete weak differential operators offers a new paradigm in numerical methods for partial differential equations .    the proposed wg finite element algorithm for the fourth order problem ( [ 0.1 ] )",
    "is based on two new ideas : ( 1 ) the computation of a discrete weak second order elliptic operator locally on each element that takes into account the coefficient matrix from applications ; and ( 2 ) a stabilizer that takes into account the jump of the coefficient matrix from applications .",
    "the research is innovative in that the proposed algorithm is the first ever finite element method that works for the fourth order problem ( [ 0.1 ] ) based on the variational formulation ( [ 0.2 ] ) .",
    "there is a point which is of great significance to point out in the process of our research .",
    "actually , there is a more straightforward variational formulation for the fourth order problem ( [ 0.1 ] ) which is easier to propose : seeking @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 , @xmath20 , such that @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "however , according to our research , we find that variational formulation ( [ 0.2 - 2 ] ) is not an appropriate variational formulation where weak galerkin finite element method can be applied successfullly and the code based on variational formulation ( [ 0.2 - 2 ] ) can not work well especially when @xmath10 is not small enough .",
    "there is a straightforward reason from the formulation that there is no second order elliptic term in the variational formulation ( [ 0.2 - 2 ] ) which plays an important role in the algorithm design .",
    "this fact leads to the result that the analysis of wg method can not pass through based on the variational formulation ( [ 0.2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : wpartial ] is devoted to a discussion of weak second order elliptic operator , and weak gradient as well as their discrete versions . in section [ section :",
