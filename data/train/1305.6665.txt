    "refraction of light is the fundamental optical phenomenon .",
    "significant progress in fabrication of nanoscale structures led to creation of optical metamaterials which allow us to manipulate the way light refracts .",
    "for example , at the interface of negative - index metamaterials , the angle of refraction turns out to be negative @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", an array of optically thin resonators with subwavelength separation was used to modulate the phase of incident light along the interface .",
    "it was demonstrated that , depending on the designed phase gradient , the refraction angle can be controlled at will for any incident angle .",
    "the authors of  @xcite showed that a metamaterial with a near - to - zero refractive index acts as an antenna with an extremely high directivity  a source embedded in a slab of such metamaterial emits the waves whose refraction at the interfaces with the surrounding media causes concentration of the outgoing energy in a narrow cone .",
    "a phenomenon that is reverse to this directive emission was predicted by feng in  @xcite .",
    "feng showed that the direction of the incoming energy flow bends towards the interface normal for any incident angle when p - polarized ( transverse magnetic ) light enters an @xmath1-near - zero metamaterial ( the metamaterial with vanishingly small real part of permittivity ) .",
    "he clarified that such all - angle collimation of the incident light ( in the original paper , term `` omnidirectional bending '' was used ) is a result of material losses .    in our work",
    "we show that similar all - angle collimation can be realized with s - polarized ( transverse electric ) incident light at the interface of metamaterials with a vanishingly small real part of permeability , so - called @xmath0-near - zero metamaterials .",
    "note , however , that the theoretical framework we use is different from the one employed by feng  @xcite : to obtain our result we apply the theory of inhomogeneous waves which is commonly used to describe refraction of light in lossy media  @xcite .",
    "such approach allows us to generalize the result by feng  @xcite and shed some light on its polarization dependence .",
    "we show that all - angle collimation of incident light in @xmath1-near - zero and @xmath0-near - zero metamaterials is the manifestation of the same phenomenon which takes place under different polarization conditions .",
    "a vanishingly small real part of permeability can be found in negative - index metamaterials near permeability resonances which are used to achieve a negative index of refraction .",
    "to confirm our idea about all - angle collimation of incident light in @xmath0-near - zero metamaterials , we calculate the transmission angle of the poynting vector at the interface with the negative - index metamaterial recently reported by garca - meca _",
    "et  al . _",
    "since all - angle collimation of incident light is a consequence of losses in a medium  @xcite and the propagation of light in lossy media differs from that in lossless media , we first summarize the basic features of light waves in lossy media  @xcite . unlike the case of light waves in lossless media , the equiamplitude and equiphase planes of light waves in lossy media are not parallel , and such waves are called _ inhomogeneous waves_. the summarized results in this section will be used in the following sections to determine the direction of the poynting vector of the wave transmitted through a metamaterial .",
    "we consider an interface between two isotropic media ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first medium is a lossless dielectric with a real refractive index @xmath3 and the second medium is a lossy metamaterial with complex permittivity @xmath4 and permeability @xmath5 .",
    "an incident plane wave with a real wave vector @xmath6 comes from the first medium .",
    "the incident angle @xmath7 is an angle between @xmath6 and the unit vector normal to the interface @xmath8 , which is pointing to the second medium .",
    "the complex electric and magnetic fields , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , of the transmitted wave are written as @xmath11 , \\qquad      { \\mathbf{h } } = { \\mathbf{h}}\\exp[i({\\omega}t-{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot{\\mathbf{r}})],\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are complex amplitude vectors , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are a wave vector and a position vector , respectively , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the wave frequency and time . since the second medium is lossy , the wave vector of the transmitted wave is complex : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the real phase and attenuation vectors , respectively , and they are written as @xmath21 in eq .",
    "the phase vector @xmath19 is decomposed as a sum of two vectors , namely , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "vectors @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath23 are , respectively , parallel and perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the attenuation vector @xmath20 is always normal to the interface .",
    "thus vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not parallel ( the only exception is the case of normal incidence , @xmath25 ) and the transmitted wave is inhomogeneous as mentioned earlier .",
    "the normal components of vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 have magnitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , which are given by  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 represents the sign of @xmath33 .",
    "equation   says that the normal component @xmath34 of the phase vector @xmath19 is positive ( i.  e. , @xmath19 is directed away from the interface ) if @xmath35 , and negative ( i.  e. , @xmath19 is directed towards the interface ) if @xmath36 .",
    "the latter case corresponds to negative refraction  @xcite .",
    "refraction of the wave at the interface of a lossy material .",
    "the incident plane wave has a real wave vector @xmath6 , while the wave vector @xmath14 of the transmitted wave is complex due to material losses : @xmath18 . in general , the phase @xmath19 and attenuation @xmath20 vectors are not parallel , and the transmitted wave is inhomogeneous . ]",
    "the refractive index @xmath37 and the attenuation coefficient @xmath38 are formally defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in practice they can be found from the following equations : @xmath41 note that , according to eq .  , both @xmath37 and @xmath38 depend on the incident angle @xmath7 .",
    "the transmission angle @xmath42 is the angle between @xmath19 and @xmath8 , and can be found from the snell s law , @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we derive the equation for the poynting vector of the wave transmitted into a metamaterial . for this purpose",
    "we first consider the decomposition of the complex amplitude vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the transmitted wave into the s- and p - polarized modes ( te and tm modes , respectively ) . since the plane of incidence is a plane spanned by vectors @xmath6 and @xmath8 , the vector @xmath44=[{\\mathbf{k}}\\times{{\\mathbf{\\hat{q}}}}]$ ] is normal to the plane of incidence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . using vector @xmath45",
    ", we can decompose the complex electric vector amplitude @xmath12 into the s- and p - polarized components : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48=   { \\mathbf{s}}^{-2}({\\mathbf{e}}\\cdot{{\\mathbf{\\hat{q}}}})[{\\mathbf{s}}\\times{\\mathbf{k}}]$ ] , or @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the complex amplitudes of the s- and p - polarized components , respectively .",
    "amplitudes @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the transmitted wave are connected with the corresponding amplitudes of the incident wave by fresnel coefficients @xcite , i.  e. , @xmath54 if the incident wave is s - polarized , and @xmath55 if it is p - polarized . to find the decomposition of the complex magnetic vector amplitude @xmath13",
    ", we substitute eq .   into the identity",

    "\\label{eq : ssp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the s - polarized component @xmath63 depends only on @xmath52 , while the p - polarized component @xmath64 depends only on @xmath53 .",
    "the cross - polarized component @xmath65 depends on both @xmath52 and @xmath53 . according to eq .",
    ", the cross - polarized component @xmath65 exists only in lossy media where the wave vector @xmath14 is complex .",
    "a real time - averaged poynting vector @xmath66 corresponds to the real part of @xmath60 . expanding the vector products and taking the real parts of eq .  , we find that @xmath67 $ ] , where    [ eq : p ] @xmath68    with @xmath69 and @xmath70 being the real and imaginary parts of the corresponding expressions .",
    "equation  @xmath71 says that the s- and p - polarized components of the poynting vector are proportional to the sum of vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while the cross - polarized component @xmath72 is proportional to vector @xmath45 and thus normal to the plane of incidence .",
    "the component @xmath72 is responsible for the transversal shift of the transmitted light beam .",
    "a similar shift named imbert - fedorov shift takes place for the reflected light beam for the case of total internal reflection @xcite . despite the fact that these two shifts look similar",
    ", there are several different viewpoints on the component @xmath72 : the authors of  @xcite argue that `` there is no mechanism for energy transport in the direction perpendicular to the plane of incidence '' and set @xmath72 equal to zero , based on the fact that `` the poynting vector is defined only up to an arbitrary , additive , solenoidal vector '' .",
    "fedorov in his book @xcite believes that this component is real and responsible for the light pressure in the direction perpendicular to the plane of incidence .",
    "the authors of  @xcite came to the conclusion that the appearance of @xmath72 is caused by excitation of surface electric polariton mode or surface magnetic mode by the resonant or non - resonant manner . in this work , however , we only consider s- ( @xmath54 ) or p - polarized ( @xmath55 ) incident wave for which @xmath73 .    by inspecting eq .",
    ", we find that both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are parallel to @xmath20 if @xmath76 or @xmath77 is equal to zero , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , for any incident angle , the attenuation vector @xmath20 is always normal to the interface [ see eq .  ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , at the interface of a material with a vanishingly small real part of permeability ( @xmath78 ) , the s - polarized incident wave gives rise to the transmitted wave whose energy flow is directed normally to the interface , irrespective of the incident angle .",
    "a similar argument holds for the p - polarized incident wave at the interface of a material with a vanishingly small real part of permittivity ( @xmath79 ) , as shown by feng  @xcite .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to note that it is possible to express the poynting vector in eq .   in terms of the s- and p - polarized components of the magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "the easiest way to do so is to apply the usual electromagnetic duality by replacing @xmath80 and @xmath1 by @xmath81 and @xmath0 , and using the corresponding amplitudes @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 $ ] ) instead of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "after such procedures we will find that all - angle collimation in @xmath1-near - zero and @xmath0-near - zero metamaterials happens for s- and p - polarized magnetic field @xmath10 , respectively , which is opposite to the case of @xmath9 .",
    "however , this is not surprising , since vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 are perpendicular in the incoming wave , and , for example , s - polarization in terms of @xmath9 corresponds to p - polarization in terms of @xmath10 .",
    "( a ) variation of the real @xmath76 and imaginary @xmath85 parts of the permeability @xmath0 as a function of wavelength @xmath86 . ( b ) and ( c ) the transmission angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the s- and p - polarized components of the poynting vector as functions of wavelength @xmath86 and incident angle @xmath7 .",
    "all above functions are calculated for the interface between vacuum and the metamaterial reported in  @xcite .",
    "the spectral region of negative refraction is located between the two dotted vertical lines.,width=264 ]    now we consider the transmission angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 for s- and p - polarized components of the poynting vector .",
    "angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 are defined as the angles between vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , and the unit normal @xmath8 .",
    "consider , for example , the angle @xmath87 .",
    "we can find this angle from the equation , @xmath89|/({\\mathbf{p}}_s\\cdot{{\\mathbf{\\hat{q}}}})$ ] .",
    "using eq .   and taking into account that @xmath90={\\mathbf{s}}$ ] and @xmath91",
    ", we find that @xmath92 .",
    "similarly we obtain @xmath93 .",
    "this form of equations for @xmath87 and @xmath88 was previously obtained in  @xcite . using the equations of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ,",
    "we finally obtain @xmath97 here we see another manifestation of all - angle collimation .",
    "namely , in case of @xmath78 or @xmath79 the corresponding transmission angle , @xmath87 or @xmath88 , is equal to zero , irrespective of the incident angle . moreover , eq . says that the transmission angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 are not equal , which means that the direction of the energy flow in a lossy material is different for s- and p - polarized incident wave  @xcite .",
    "however , for any natural material this difference is negligibly small , since usually @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which , according to eq .  , means that @xmath100 .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be significant in metamaterials where the above inequalities may not hold .    to be more quantitative we calculate the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for the case in which the first medium is vacuum ( @xmath101 ) and the second medium is the negative - index metamaterial reported in  @xcite .",
    "we retrieve the relevant parameters for the permittivity @xmath1 and permeability @xmath0 of this metamaterial , performing the parameter fitting for the drude model  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](a ) shows the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the retrieved permeability @xmath0 on the wavelength @xmath86 . we see that this dependence has a resonance feature and the real part @xmath76 of the permeability is equal to zero at the wavelengths 732 and 768 nm . at these wavelengths",
    "we expect all - angle collimation for incident s - polarized wave .",
    "using the retrieved functions for @xmath1 and @xmath0 , we calculate @xmath87 and @xmath88 by eq .   where values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath42 have been obtained using the equations in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "figures [ fig : fig2](b ) and [ fig : fig2](c ) show the dependencies of the transmission angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 on the wavelength @xmath86 and the incident angle @xmath7 . in spite of negative refraction",
    ", we consider @xmath87 and @xmath88 as angles between two vectors and set them positive .    as expected , we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](b ) that , at wavelengths where @xmath78 , the transmission angle @xmath87 is zero for any incident angle .",
    "therefore , the direction of energy flow in the second medium will be normal to the interface for any incident angle .    by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) and [ fig : fig2](c ) , we clearly see the difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this difference is more significant at the wavelength @xmath102 nm where we have all - angle collimation for the s - polarized component of the poynting vector .",
    "we hope that this observation will encourage experimentalists to verify the difference between the transmission angles for s- and p - polarized incident light .    before proceeding to the conclusions",
    ", we would like to briefly discuss the case in which light propagates to the reverse direction , that is , from @xmath1-near - zero or @xmath0-near - zero lossy metamaterial into an ordinary medium .",
    "one may naively think that we will have a directive emission similar to the one in  @xcite .",
    "however , a simple generalization of our result to the reverse problem leads to an unphysical solution : in this work we have assumed that a homogeneous ( the attenuation vector equals zero ) plane wave comes from a lossless medium to the interface of a lossy metamaterial .",
    "therefore , the most natural way to formulate the reverse problem is to assume that a homogeneous damped ( the nonzero attenuation vector is parallel to the wave vector ) plane wave comes from a lossy metamaterial to the interface with a lossless medium .",
    "this assumption implies that somewhere deep in the metamaterial there is an embedded light source , whose radiation , close to the interface , can be approximated by homogeneous damped waves . upon arrival to the interface , the attenuation vector of these homogeneous damped waves will have a nonzero tangential component ( the only exception is the waves propagating along the normal to the interface ) .",
    "since the tangential components of attenuation vectors are continuous across any interface  @xcite , the wave outgoing from the metamaterial will have nonzero attenuation vectors , that is , the wave transmitted into the lossless surrounding medium will be inhomogeneous .",
    "a closer examination shows that the attenuation vector of the outgoing wave will point towards the interface , which means that the amplitude of the outgoing wave will grow unlimitedly , which is unphysical .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the radiation of a light source embedded in a lossy metamaterial can not be represented by homogeneous damped waves ; to find a correct solution one should consider the mechanism of light emission from such source in more details , which is out of scope of this work .",
    "in conclusion we have theoretically studied the transmission of light waves in @xmath0-near - zero metamaterials .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath1-near - zero metamaterials  @xcite , we have found the effect of all - angle collimation of incident light in @xmath0-near - zero metamaterials for the s - polarized incident wave .",
    "thus we have provided the generalized footing , based on which we can show , with sufficient clarity , that all - angle collimation of incident light in @xmath1-near - zero and @xmath0-near - zero metamaterials is the manifestation of the same phenomenon under different polarization of incident light .",
    "we have presented specific results for the negative - index metamaterial with a permeability resonance where the real part of the permeability becomes zero .",
    "additionally , we have shown that the transmission angle of the poynting vector depends on the polarization of the incident wave , and this difference is very significant in the spectral region where all - angle collimation of incident light takes place .",
