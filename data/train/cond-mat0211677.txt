    "manganese oxides with perovskite structure have been subject of intense study in recent years .",
    "this is in large part motivated by two main factors : their potential technological application , related to the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect displayed by many of these oxides , and the large variety of magnetic / electronic phenomena such as double - exchange , superexchange , jahn - teller effect , charge / orbital ordering related to the cmr.@xcite    a common way to represent the manganese perovskite oxides is through the ruddlesden - popper series ( r , a)@xmath12mn@xmath13o@xmath14 ( r = rare - earth ; a = alkaline metal ) .",
    "the basic structure of the series consists of alternate stacking of rock - salt type block layers ( r , a)@xmath15o@xmath15 and @xmath16mno@xmath15 sheets along the @xmath17axis , where @xmath18 represents the number of adjacent mno@xmath19 sheets , a quantity closely related to the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "so , the @xmath20 series represents the prototype three - dimensional ( 3d ) cmr material ( r , a)mno@xmath21 , the subject of many investigations lately ; @xmath22 corresponds to compounds such as la@xmath15cuo@xmath23 , the metal oxide that originates the high-@xmath24 superconducting cuprates family ; @xmath25 represents the bilayered magnetic manganite system ( r , a)@xmath21mn@xmath15o@xmath26.@xcite this last system shows two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic and electronic properties associated with a very large magnetoresistance ( mr ) @xmath27% at @xmath28k and @xmath29 t for la@xmath30sr@xmath31mn@xmath15o@xmath26.@xcite for comparison , in the 3d sr - doped la@xmath32sr@xmath33mno@xmath21 the mr reaches @xmath34% at @xmath35 t around @xmath24.@xcite    sr@xmath36mn@xmath15o@xmath26 .",

    "it consists of pairs of corner shared mno@xmath40 octahedron stacked along the @xmath17axis and isolated by la(sr ) atoms .",
    "the dashed lines enclose the unit cell of the bilayer system . also , indicated in the figure are the intra - mno@xmath19 plane , @xmath41 , inter - mno@xmath15 planes , @xmath38 , and inter - bilayers , @xmath39 , exchange constants .    by changing @xmath42 , the hole - doped bilayers la@xmath43sr@xmath36mn@xmath15o@xmath44 present a wide variety of electron transport behaviour and magnetic structures .",
    "for the range @xmath45 it is found at low temperatures , @xmath46k : ( i ) metallic character and ferromagnetic ( fm ) order along the @xmath17axis for @xmath3;@xcite ( ii ) metallic character and fm order in the mno@xmath15 sheets ( @xmath47plane ) for @xmath48 ; @xcite ( iii ) metallic character and fm order in the @xmath47plane , with a weak antiferromagnetic ( wafm ) component along the @xmath49-axis for @xmath50;@xcite ( iv ) metallic a - type afm with a small fraction ( @xmath51% ) of a secondary ce - type afm insulating phase for @xmath52.@xcite    in all cases , the 2d character of the magnetic interactions is evident in these systems .",
    "for example , the measured critical exponent of the sublattice magnetization near @xmath24 in the @xmath53 sample,@xcite was found to be very close to the expected value for the 2d ising model.@xcite the two - dimensionality of these systems is also revealed by the strong anisotropy in the resistivity , with the @xmath47plane resistivity being two or three orders of magnitude smaller than that along the @xmath17axis.bilayersdisc    we have studied the influence of the dimensionality on the magnetization and specific heat of the @xmath25 hole - doped bilayered system la@xmath43sr@xmath36mn@xmath15o@xmath26 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we present a consistent interpretation of the low - temperature data in terms of a gas of thermally excited 2d magnons .",
    "single crystals of la@xmath43sr@xmath36mn@xmath15o@xmath26 for @xmath54 were melt grown in flowing @xmath55 o@xmath15 ( balance ar ) in a floating zone optical image furnace ( nec sc - m15hd ) .",

    "figure [ mvsh ] shows the field - dependent @xmath57magnetization curves , @xmath58vs@xmath59 , taken at @xmath10k for @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath60 @xmath49 .",
    "the measurements in all samples were made by zero field cooling ( zfc ) to @xmath10k , then the field was increased to @xmath62 t and decreased again to zero . for @xmath63 and @xmath5",
    "we observed the usual non - linear fm behavior .",
    "the @xmath64 sample displays a linear afm behavior with a slight anisotropy between the @xmath17axis and the @xmath47plane plus a small non - linear fm - like behavior at low fields ( @xmath65koe ) .    from the @xmath58vs@xmath66 curves we obtain the saturation magnetization , @xmath67 , for the fm samples . using this values",
    "it is possible to estimate the effective spin of the mn ions , since @xmath68 , and compare it with the theoretical expected one , @xmath69 .    considering that the theoretical valance of the manganese ion in the undoped compound @xmath70 , la@xmath15srmn@xmath15o@xmath26 , is @xmath71 , and that their electronic configuration is 3d@xmath724s@xmath73",

    "we obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81t@xmath82 and calculated the exchange energy @xmath83t@xmath82 .",
    "no appreciable difference is found in the @xmath84 values when using @xmath85 or @xmath77 . for @xmath7 , it should be noted that the ferromagnetic approximation for the spin wave energies , as indicated by the linear behavior of the specific heat in zero field , only pertains to the modes that make a significant contribution in the temperature range of the experiment . if measurements were made at much lower temperatures , one would expect a temperature dependence characteristic of a weakly anisotropic a - afm .",
    "we calculated the @xmath86 from @xmath87 .",
    "using @xmath80 and @xmath88 we computed the electron density of states at fermi level , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "finally , from @xmath90 we obtain the exchange energy @xmath91 .",
    "the experimental parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath81t@xmath82 are listed in the table iii .",
    "the values of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath97t@xmath82 derived from the data , are given in the table iv .",
    "the values of @xmath80 and @xmath89 of the insulating samples , @xmath98 @xmath4 and @xmath5 are in reasonable agreement with those reported in the literature ( see , e.g. , the results of okuda _ _ et al.__@xcite ) , suggesting a half metallic behavior .",
    "in fact , electronic band structure calculations performed by meskine _ _ et al.__@xcite suggested a half metallic character for some bilayers .",
    "in particular , for @xmath64 they found the theoretical value of @xmath99 states / ry f.u .",
    ", in excellent agreement with our experimental value of @xmath100 states / ry f.u ..    the values of @xmath101 and @xmath83t@xmath82 are in reasonable agreement with the results previously reported by neutron scattering studies@xcite . in figure [ comparison ]",
    "we compare the @xmath84 values obtained in the present work and the ones reported by hirota _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite the @xmath101 values obtained from the zero field specific heat agree with the values inferred from the analysis of the magnetization .",
    "the values of @xmath102t@xmath82 differ somewhat from @xmath101 .",
    "that may be a consequence of the presence of the double exchange mechanism since @xmath103 is field - independent for a pure heisenberg system .",
    "the @xmath104 values are also in fair agreement with the hirota s ones , while the @xmath83t@xmath82 are in excellent agreement .",
    "the above is possible related to the differences in the energy scale probed by the different techniques .",
    "our zero field thermodynamic measurements probe lower energy magnons , while the field - dependent measurements involve magnons with a slight higher energy , as the @xmath11 t magnetic field opens a gap @xmath105mev in the magnon dispersion relation . on the other hand ,",
    "generally neutron experiments involve magnons with energies @xmath106mev .",
    "so , it is expected a smaller difference between the values of @xmath84 derived from neutron diffraction and the obtained from @xmath11 t specific heat than with the ones extracted from the zero field specific heat .",
    "also , a significant renormalization of the magnon energies at small @xmath107 , that is not reflected in the neutron data , may be present .",
    "t @xmath108 @xmath49 to eq.(7 ) for @xmath3 ( a ) , @xmath4 ( b ) , @xmath5 ( c ) , and @xmath109 ( d ) samples.,height=302 ]     values , obtained on the present work and the ones reported by hirota _",
    "et al_.@xcite open squares correspond to the values derived from the @xmath110 analysis .",
    "open ( solid ) circles correspond to the values derived from @xmath111 analysis with @xmath112t@xmath82 .",
    "open triangles present the values from hirota _ et al_.@xcite , height=302 ]",
    "in summary , our experimental specific heat results reveal two interesting features : ( i ) the linear , high - gamma behavior of the zero - field data , independent of hole concentration , magnetic order or conductivity and ( ii ) the strong magnetic field dependence of the measurements .",
    "we propose a model considering the presence of 2d fm magnons to explain the data .",
    "we calculated the influence of these magnons on the magnetization of the fm samples and specific heat .",
    "in all the cases the model gives a good fit , showing that the change in magnetization and the specific heat of the system can be well described by a 2d fm magnon gas . in the case of the antiferromagnetic system ( @xmath7 ) , the linear behavior of the specific heat is shown to be a consequence of the weak coupling between the bilayers sheets , that enables the occurrence of the 2d fm magnons .",
    "as noted , we find similar values for @xmath41 from both the magnetization and the specific heat analysis , indicating an internal consistency on our analysis .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath41 we found are close to the ones derived from the neutron scattering studiesa - afm , chatterji1,chatterji2,perring .",
    "the last provides further support to our analysis .",
