    "the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath3 is a fundamental quantity in considering magnetic properties of an electron system . in a free electron gas",

    ", @xmath3 is suppressed below the superconducting phase transition temperature @xmath2 to vanish at @xmath5 @xcite , because the spin degrees of freedom become inactive by the formation of singlet cooper pairs .",
    "the suppression of the spin susceptibility has been also observed in the underdoped regime of high-@xmath2 cuprates , which is referred to as the spin gap phenomenon in the literature @xcite .",
    "although the origin of the spin gap is still in debate , the importance of preformed pairs has been pointed out @xcite .    since the realization of superfluid @xmath6k @xcite and @xmath1li @xcite fermi gases ,",
    "the high tunability of this quantum system has attracted much attention @xcite . indeed , using a tunable pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance @xcite",
    ", one can study superfluid properties from the weak - coupling bcs regime to the strong - coupling bec limit in a unified manner ( bcs - bec crossover ) @xcite .",
    "in the so - called crossover region , a deviation of single - particle excitation spectrum from the free particle dispersion has been observed in the normal state , by using the photoemission - type experiment developed by jila group @xcite . as an explanation for this anomaly , the possibility of the pseudogap phenomenon associated with strong pairing fluctuations has been proposed @xcite .",
    "since the cold fermi gas system is much simpler than high-@xmath2 cuprates , the former system would be useful for the assessment of the preformed - pair scenario discussed in the latter .",
    "besides the tunable interaction , the high tunability of population imbalance is another advantage of cold fermi gases @xcite .",
    "when we describe two atomic hyperfine states in a fermi gas by pseudospin @xmath7 , a polarized fermi gas is closely related to an electron system under an external magnetic field . in the limit of low population imbalance , one may evaluate the spin susceptibility . using this quantity",
    ", one can examine whether the preformed singlet pairs really appear in the bcs - bec crossover regime of a cold fermi gas . in the case of a finite population imbalance",
    ", the mismatch of the fermi surfaces between the @xmath8-spin component and @xmath9-spin component is expected to cause the instability of the @xmath4-wave superfluid state @xcite , where various exotic states have been proposed , such as the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite and the sarma phase @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate ( pseudo)magnetic properties of a normal state fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region . in the unpolarized case , the strong - coupling theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) @xcite has been extensively used to successfully clarify various physical properties of this system @xcite . however",
    ", when we apply this theory to a polarized fermi gas , it is known that negative spin susceptibility is obtained in the crossover region @xcite ( which is thermodynamically forbidden @xcite ) .",
    "because of this serious problem , so far , the phase diagram of a polarized fermi gas has mainly been examined within the mean - field level @xcite . however , as in the unpolarized case , strong - coupling effects would be also important in the bcs - bec crossover regime of a polarized fermi gas .",
    "indeed , it has been pointed out that the fflo state ( which has been predicted in a polarized fermi gas within the mean - field analysis @xcite ) is unstable against pairing fluctuations @xcite .",
    "thus , to discuss the bcs - bec crossover physics of a polarized fermi gas , we need a reliable and tractable strong - coupling theory which can overcome the above mentioned problem .    in this paper , we show that the  negative susceptibility problem \" also exists in the ordinary ( non - self - consistent ) @xmath0-matrix approximation , which has been also extensively used in the unpolarized case . clarifying the origin of this serious problem , we present a minimal extension of the @xmath0-matrix theory to correctly give the required positive spin susceptibility in the whole bcs - bec crossover region . the calculated spin susceptibility in this extended @xmath0-matrix theory",
