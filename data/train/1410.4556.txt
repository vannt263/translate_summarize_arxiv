    "we use the hard x - ray band to set the normalization in order to minimize the contribution of the diffuse , thermal emission , which dominates at lower energies .",

    "the sfr in ngc1266 is not straightforward to derive .",
    "the nuclear region is both highly obscured and contains large amounts of shocked gas @xcite , resulting in important caveats on traditional sfr estimators .",
    "if there is a buried agn in ngc1266 , given the deep column of gas sitting directly along the line - of - sight , any radiatively powerful agn would be compton - thick , and also have a high optical depth even to mid - ir emission .",
    "the agn therefore would make an unknown contribution to the total ir flux , causing an overestimate of the sfr .",
    "@xcite showed that the ionized gas emission line ratios in the system are consistent with shocks , evidenced not only from the line diagnostic diagrams @xcite , but also from the large - scale velocity structures .",
    "this would therefore contaminate attempts to determine the sfr using ionized gas lines from h  ii regions . in the following , we use the available tracers of sf to define lower and upper limits to the total sf taking place in the dense gas in ngc1266 .",
    "the 24@xmath10 m flux will also overestimate the sfr , as it is clear that the agn in the system contributes non - negligibly to the mid - ir flux ( fig .",

    "uv photons from young stars form the basis of most techniques to estimate sfrs ; typically , however , in a dense , dusty object like the nucleus of ngc1266 , they are reprocessed into ir emission .",
    "ionizing photons from the agn also add to the uv emission , however .",
    "we can obtain a firm lower limit on the sfr from the uv photons that do directly escape the star - forming region and appear in the galex far - uv image , this is 0.003@xmath90 @xcite .",

    "these large molecules are excited by uv photons and re - emit in the mid - ir .",
    "the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) spectrum was fitted using pahfit @xcite , and the derived sfr from the pah emission is 0.3 m@xmath34  yr@xmath1 from @xcite , normalized to a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ; @xcite ) . due to the large levels of extinction toward the sf region and the possibility that shocks have destroyed some pahs , we consider the sfr derived from the pah+far - uv emission ( of @xmath91  m@xmath34  yr@xmath1 ) to represent a lower limit .",
    "it is possible that the poststarburst stellar population , as well as the agn itself might excite the pah emission , but compared to the shock destruction and extinction , a - star radiation is likely not the dominant effect .",
    "second , the uv flux absorbed from the sf and agn and re - emitted in the far - ir can be estimated by fitting the optical - to - submillimeter spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . to create this , we used aperture photometry through a 15@xmath92 diameter aperture subtracting the corresponding sky and estimating the flux 3@xmath8 above the general background .",

    "the momentum ratio @xmath109 , which needs to be of order unity to use photon momentum driving to explain the mass outflow rate , is also very high . in ngc1266 , with @xmath110  ergss@xmath1 , @xmath111  yr@xmath1 , @xmath112  km  s@xmath1 , @xmath113 .",
    "models to explain such high ratios typically invoke energy driven flows @xcite or require a high optical depth to the agn , even in the ir @xcite . while both of these phenomena might be present in this system , it is unlikely that they are able to compensate for the nearly two orders of magnitude factor of @xmath114 .",
    "@xcite were able to show that momentum driving by coupling to the radio jet would also be sufficient to drive the outflow , where the radio jet mechanical energy of the agn does not depend on the agn also being radiatively powerful .",
    "therefore , this molecular outflow likely can not be driven by photons , no matter the source , but the radio jet is energetically capable of doing so .    to investigate how long it takes a galaxy to deplete its molecular gas , the rate at which the mass is outflowing is not the optimal property to investigate , but rather the rate at which the gas is escaping the galaxy . in ngc1266 , @xcite presented strong evidence that the gas remains far longer than would be assumed if one calculated the depletion time via @xmath115 , likely pointing to the fact that gas that does not escape falls back into the center .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dense_wings ] , the vast majority of the outflowing molecular gas does not have sufficient speed to be driven completely out of the gravitational potential of ngc1266 .",
    "if the mass driving is not constant , only 2% of the molecular gas will be capable of completely escaping the galaxy ( @xmath116  yr@xmath1 ) , and the remaining outflowing gas will rain back down onto the center .",
    "this possibly means that the agn - driven outflow is _ extending _ the life of the molecular gas in the system , by prohibiting the molecular gas from forming stars and suppressing sf . at the current mass _ escape _ rate , ngc1266 will be completely depleted of gas in 2 gyr ( assuming the only avenue for depletion is through outflow , if @xmath117 , @xmath118 is closer to 1gyr ) , rather than in 85myr , as was originally reported in @xcite .",
    "there are two possible scenarios that could describe the activity in the center of ngc1266 , and in particular , the far - ir emission .",
    "each scenario comes with a set of evidence as well as caveats .",
    "firstly , ngc1266 could have a radiatively powerful , accreting supermassive black hole ) ] .",
    "@xcite showed that ngc1266 has molecular line ratios characteristic of ulirgs ( bright high - order co transitions and abundant h@xmath42o ) and that the high transitions of co either must be powered by strong shocks or an agn , but that these two scenarios are degenerate .",
    "an agn , whether radiatively powerful or intrinsicially weak is buried under sufficient molecular gas to obscure radiation from the mid - ir to the hard x - rays .",
    "the second scenario is that ngc1266 does not contain a radiatively powerful agn , but instead a deeply buried ultra - compact starbursting cluster that is providing the vast majority of the radiation , reprocessed into far - ir emission .",
    "several pieces of evidence point to an radiatively powerful agn in ngc1266 .",

    "the cs(21 ) map was used to derive a line - of - sight gas column density in the direction of the agn to be @xmath120 .",
    "this obscuring column is considered compton thick , capable of burying a substantial agn and attenuating x - rays .",
    "@xcite were able to use _",
    "nustar _ to show that 210kev x - rays could be completely attenuated in powerful quasars given a sufficiently large column .",
    "if a powerful agn were present in ngc1266 , the molecular gas column would be sufficient to attenuate the majority of its emission .    in  [ sec",

    "given that the obscuring molecular gas is likely clumpy , there are likely lines - of - sight that are slightly less dense , which would allow more x - rays to escape , leading to a smaller agn luminosity for the modeled x - ray luminosity .",
    "the mid - ir sed of ngc1266 is also characteristic of an agn , with @xmath121 and @xmath122 placing the galaxy within the agn selection region of @xcite .",
    "the excess emission seen in the mid - ir ( between 10100@xmath10 m ) from the _ spitzer _ irs ( green ) also indicates that an agn component is necessary to match the mid - ir sed . using the @xcite models and deriving the luminosity associated solely with the hot dust , power law component seen in the sed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n1266_sed ] ) , we find the mid - ir luminosity of the agn component to be at least @xmath123 ergs s@xmath1 .",

    "figure [ fig : cs+alma ] shows that the bulk of the far - ir continuum emission is coming from a region within 30pc of the nucleus , rather than the more extended dense gas in the system .",
    "this indicates that a compact source , such as the agn , could be providing most of the dust heating .",
    "if we assume that the central compact continuum source is heated by the agn , then the compact emission associated with the agn accounts for 66% of the total flux density , and the extended emission accounts for 34% of the total flux density ( after a 30% correction for flux resolved out by the alma beam ) .",
    "we fit a sed to the central 15@xmath12 of ngc1266 , finding a far - ir luminosity of @xmath124 ( @xmath125  ergss@xmath1 ) . assuming that the far - ir emission from the central source in the 870@xmath10 m image is powered by the agn",

    "the bolometric agn luminosity would therefore be about 18% of the eddington luminosity , suggesting that ngc1266 has energetics similar to a typical seyfert galaxy @xcite if scenario 1 is correct .",
    "the presence of an agn in ngc1266 does not necessarily confirm the presence of a radiatively powerful agn .",
    "it has been shown that many low - luminosity agns also exhibit fe  k@xmath67 emission @xcite .",
    "although the molecular data confirm the compton - thick line - of - sight column toward the agn , we can not rule out the possibility that preferential lines - of - sight in a highly clumpy ism might allow a larger amount of the x - ray emission from a weak agn to escape , meaning the source of the far - ir luminosity in the compact core is not definitively due to a radiatively powerful agn .",
    "it is theoretically possible for a ultra - compact starburst to produce the observed compact far - ir emission @xcite .",
    "the total ir luminosity in the compact core is @xmath130 , with a radius @xmath31pc , has a total luminosity density of @xmath131kpc@xmath38 , well below the maximum luminosity density of star - forming cores ( 10@xmath132kpc@xmath38 ; @xcite ) .",

    "while this ultracompact region might host 66% of the sf in the system , it only hosts @xmath137% of the dense molecular gas .",
    "this means that the minority of molecular gas is that which is hosting the vast majority of sf in this scenario .",
    "while the current data are able to put strong constraints on the size of the emitting ultra - compact core and mass enclosed , they are not able to definitively identify the source of the radiation .",
    "we need to measure emission coming directly from a compton - thick agn , constrain the size of the emitting region such that it is physically impossible for an ultra - compact starburst to be the source or find an alternative measure of sf . measuring a hard x - ray flux from _ nustar _",

    "the new capabilities of alma will be able to reach this resolution , and provide the definitive evidence of the presence of the agn .",
    "finally , one might be able to count individual supernova remnants ( snrs ) in ngc1266 ( similar to what has been done in arp220 ; @xcite ) using transatlantic very long baseline interferometry , which should be able to distinguish between a single point source ( scenario 1 : the agn ) and multiple snrs ( scenario 2 : ultra - compact starburst ) .",

    "instead , it is possible that the bulk of the dense gas ( which is closest to the agn ) is distributed spherically .    in this case",
    ", there is an alternative way to balance gravity , and hinder collapse , namely turbulence injected by the agn outflow . in scenario 1 ( agn ) , the molecular outflow is likely to be able to provide a source of that turbulent injection into the molecular gas as a whole . in scenario 2 ( starburst ) , it might be feedback that exists between the dense molecular gas and both the molecular outflow as well as the winds from the ultra - compact starbursting region .",
    "both of these phenomena inject further turbulence into the outskirt molecular gas , leading to the observed suppression .    to obtain a rough estimate of the required outflow velocities , we assume an ordered radial outflow , @xmath157 , as the dominant component of the kinetic energy .",
    "the necessary radial velocity is then the free - fall velocity for a uniform density sphere : @xmath158    for ngc1266 , with m@xmath159 m@xmath160 m@xmath96 @xcite and @xmath161 pc , the required radial velocity is @xmath157 = 100 km s@xmath1 .",

    "any bulk motion of this kind would quickly become turbulent @xcite , which could suppress sf until all the kinetic energy ( e@xmath163 = 1/2 m@xmath164  ergs ) was dissipated on a timescale @xmath165 myr , where @xmath166 is the characteristic scale of the turbulence ( assumed 275  pc ) and @xmath167 = 48.5 km s@xmath1 .",
    "indeed , turbulent energy dissipation is consistent with the large warm h@xmath42 luminosity for ngc1266 ( l@xmath168  ergss@xmath1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "if our explanation is correct , then dissipation of turbulent energy associated with the outflow ( e@xmath169  ergss@xmath1 ) is capable of energizing a large fraction of the h@xmath42 line luminosity of the warm gas . in order to maintain the activity and avoid the gas collapsing to the center in a free - fall time of @xmath170  myr",
    ", the turbulence must be maintained by constant energy input .",
    "this mechanism has been suggested to explain infertile gas in radio galaxies @xcite , stephan s quintet @xcite and ngc1266 .",
    "in fact , a re - analysis of the warm h@xmath42 emission in the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum ( taking into account extinction using the 9.7@xmath10 m silicate feature , confirmed that ngc1266 is a molecular hydrogen emission galaxy ( moheg ; @xcite ) , with @xmath99(h@xmath42 , warm)/@xmath99(7.7@xmath10 m pah ) @xmath171 .    if the driving is due to a radio jet @xcite , then the support of the gas against gravitational collapse can last at most a few@xmath172  yr per episode of agn activity .",
    "this could be prolonged as the vast majority ( 98% ) of the cold molecular gas does not have speeds exceeding the escape velocity of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this gas will thus rain back onto the nucleus , re - impart its kinetic energy into the molecular core , providing longer - timescale energy injection to counterbalance gravitational collapse .",
    "if the gas in ngc1266 were forming stars at normal efficiency , the depletion time would be @xmath173  myr , five times too short , given the present stellar population @xcite .",
    "if the current sf suppression remains consistent into the future , then the molecular gas could remain in the nucleus as long as 7  gyr , allowing the molecular gas to remain in contact with the agn for much longer than has been hypothesized @xcite .",
    "we propose that ngc1266 contains an agn whose black hole is being built up to bring it onto the @xmath127 relation following a minor merger event 500 myr ago .",
    "we hypothesize that prior to this minor merger , the supermassive black hole within ngc1266 was on the @xmath127 relation .",
    "this merger event triggered a burst of sf that increased the mass of the bulge by about 10% ( @xmath174 ; @xcite ) and left a remnant @xmath175 of gas which failed to form stars in the initial burst .",
    "the corresponding growth in the black hole mass may have involved multiple cycles of agn activity over the past 500 myr that heavily suppress further sf in the nucleus by inducing turbulence in the ism , but which will also eventually deprive the agn of fuel .",
    "our results are currently inconclusive as to whether the agn is currently in a high accretion rate phase of its cycle ( scenario 1 ) , or a low accretion - rate phase ( scenario 2 ) . in either case",
    "the large amount of gas in the nuclear region suggests that the cycles will continue until the black hole becomes massive enough that its eddington luminosity rises to the point that the outflow is able to finally expel the remaining gas . at this point",
    ", the black hole mass will match that expected on the @xmath127 relation .",
    "we have presented new carma and alma observations of the dense molecular gas and continuum of ngc1266 , which have updated properties of the mass outflow and sfr of this agn - driven molecular outflow system . using the radio free - free emission present in the 1 mm band of alma",

    "h@xmath42 conversion factor did not apply . despite this , only @xmath177  yr@xmath1 is escaping the galaxy as molecular gas .",
    "our higher mass outflow rate suggests that the driving mechanism responsible for this high momentum ratio outflow is likely momentum - coupling to the radio jet from the agn , rather than to photons from either the agn or a starburst .",
    "there are two possible scenarios that explain the activity in the nucleus of ngc1266 .",
    "scenario 1 , supported by the tentative detection of fek@xmath67 and the compton - thick column of molecular gas in the line - of - sight to a vlba detection , is that the compact 870@xmath10 m emission is due to a deeply buried , powerful agn .",
    "scenario 2 , in which an ultra - compact starburst , buried deeply under the molecular gas provides the far - ir emission , though requires a top - heavy imf to sustain . in either scenario , the sf in the majority of the dense molecular gas",

    "the most likely explanation for the suppression of sf in the dense gas is that turbulence injected by , or during the formation of , the molecular outflow has been able to balance the gravitational potential of the dense gas in the center , and thus turbulent motions are a reasonable explanation for the sf suppression seen .",

    "for the radio galaxies presented in figure [ fig : ks1266 ] , we updated the original work by @xcite , who used the 7.7@xmath10 m pah - derived sfr from @xcite , and assumed a radius of 2.5  kpc for all radio galaxies without interferometric co maps .",
    "we have determined the sfrs for these radio galaxies using the _ spitzer _ multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) 70@xmath10 m images , and measured the total flux within a given aperture , then converted the @xmath179 m flux ( assuming all flux was from sf ) to a sfr using @xcite .",

    "<S> ngc1266 is a nearby lenticular galaxy that harbors a massive outflow of molecular gas powered by the mechanical energy of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been speculated that such outflows hinder star formation ( sf ) in their host galaxies , providing a form of feedback to the process of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies , however , indicated that only jets from extremely rare , high power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback on their hosts . here </S>",
    "<S> we present detailed observations of the gas and dust continuum of ngc1266 at millimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> our observations show that molecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at @xmath0  yr@xmath1 , of which the vast majority can not escape the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> only 2  @xmath2  yr@xmath1 is actually capable of escaping the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> most of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars . </S>",
    "<S> the far - infrared emission is dominated by an ultra - compact ( @xmath3pc ) source that could either be powered by an agn or by an ultra - compact starburst . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the sf surface density ( @xmath4 ) to the gas surface density ( @xmath5 ) indicates that sf is suppressed by a factor of @xmath6 compared to normal star - forming galaxies if all gas is forming stars , and @xmath7150 for the outskirt ( 98% ) dense molecular gas if the central region is is powered by an ultra - compact starburst . </S>",
    "<S> the agn - driven bulk outflow could account for this extreme suppression by hindering the fragmentation and gravitational collapse necessary to form stars through a process of turbulent injection . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that even relatively common , low - power agns are able to alter the evolution of their host galaxies as their black holes grow onto the m-@xmath8 relation . </S>"
