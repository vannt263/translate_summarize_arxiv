    "the concept of bose  einstein condensation dates back more than 80 years to the prediction of einstein , based on bose s work on the statistics of photons , that a gas of non - interacting massive bosons would condense below a certain critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the condensation implies that below @xmath3 a non - zero fraction of the total number of particles occupies the lowest single - particle quantum state . for dilute atomic gases this phenomenon",
    "was realized experimentally in 1995 for trapped clouds of alkali atoms ( see e.g.ref .  ) .    for a uniform gas of density @xmath4",
    "the transition temperature is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the particle mass .",
    "for particles trapped in a harmonic oscillator potential ( trap frequencies @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) one has @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total number of particles . in the latter case the particle mass enters through the trap frequencies , equal to the square root of the force constants in the three directions divided by the particle mass .",
    "when a trapped gas is dilute in the sense that the atom  atom scattering length is much less than the interatomic distance , the observed transition temperatures agree well with theoretical expectation for a non - interacting gas . for",
    "less dilute gases interaction effects give rise to an observable small shift of @xmath12 proportional to the scattering length .",
    "the condensation of massive bosons into a single quantum state is intimately connected to the conservation of particle number . for massless bosons such as phonons or magnons the particle number",
    "is not fixed but depends on temperature , and there is therefore no bose ",
    "einstein condensation in the traditional sense of the term .",
    "however , there has been a wide use of model hamiltonians for magnetic systems that have features in common with those of interacting , massive bosons .",
    "the aim of the present work is to consider one such specific system , that of the dimerized cu@xmath1 spins in tlcucl@xmath2 , and compare predictions of such models with calculations that are based on ( approximate ) solutions of the many - body problem of interacting spins . a recent review of experimental and theoretical developments concerning the magnetic ordering of tlcucl@xmath2 and related compounds has been given by giamarchi _",
    "et al._@xcite    magnetization measurements@xcite and inelastic neutron - scattering experiments@xcite demonstrate clearly that nearest - neighboring pairs of @xmath0 spins of the cu@xmath1 ions in tlcucl@xmath2 are dimerized leading to an @xmath13 ground state and an @xmath14 excited triplet around 5.25.7 mev above the singlet .",
    "due to the exchange interactions between the dimers the excitations become strongly dispersive , and , in the zero - temperature limit , the minimum energy of the degenerate singlet - triplet mode , at ( 001 ) , is only about 0.7 mev .",
    "when a field is applied , the energy of one of the three normal modes is reduced and goes to zero at a critical field of about 54 koe at zero temperature .",
    "the cu spins of isostructural kcucl@xmath2 are similarly dimerized , but the interdimer interactions are relatively weaker and the critical field is about 230 koe at @xmath15 in this system.@xcite the phase transition shown by tlcucl@xmath2 at the field where the excitation energy vanishes , has been analyzed by nikuni _",
    "et al._@xcite they assumed the dimer system to be described by an effective haniltonian of the form @xmath16 where the bosonic operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote `` magnon '' creation and annihilation operators and the positive constant @xmath19 denotes the strength of the repulsive magnon  magnon interaction , assumed to be a delta function in real space . the quantity @xmath20 plays the role of a chemical potential , assumed proportional to the difference between the applied magnetic field and the critical field .",
    "using @xmath19 and @xmath6 as fitting parameters , nikuni _",
    "_  were able to give a reasonable account of the temperature dependence of the critical field and the magnetization along the applied field in the ordered antiferromagnetic state . an extended version of their theory based on a more realistic dispersion of the magnetic excitations was presented by misguich and oshikawa.@xcite however , as we shall see in detail in sec .",
    "iv below , these simplified boson models suffer from inconsistencies that originate in their neglect of the highest level of the triplet .",
    "another , more general problem with boson models is that double occupancy of a local site should be prohibited . in this connection",
    "we mention the work of sirker _",
    "et al._,@xcite who used a bond - operator approach to map the spin system onto a model of interacting bosons by introducing an infinite on - site repulsion between local triplet excitations .",
    "in the following treatment of the dimerized spin system in tlcucl@xmath2 we adopt a different point of view and start from the hamiltonian for the spin system itself , using as input the effective exchange coupling that has been derived from measured excitation spectra .",
    "our approach is a generalization of the zero - temperature theory by matsumoto _",
    "et al._,@xcite who used the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to calculate magnetization curves and excitation spectra for tlcucl@xmath2 .",
    "they also considered the case when the phase transition is induced by the application of a hydrostatic pressure.@xcite here we only address the case of a field - induced transition , but the theory of matsumoto _ et al . _",
    "is extended to include both the effects of quantum fluctuations at zero temperature and the effects of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the self - consistent version of the rpa , which is the one applied here , is faced with the similar problem of double occupancy as the boson modelling .",
    "however , here this problem is found to have a natural solution by a consideration of the higher order modifications of the green functions .",
    "the self - consistent rpa theory for the paramagnetic phase of the dimer - spin system is presented in sec .",
    "ii , which , in sec .",
    "iii , is followed by an analysis of the antiferromagnetic phase . a closer examination and discussion of the results obtained",

    "the fourier transform of the heisenberg exchange interactions between spins on sublattice @xmath42 and @xmath43 is defined in terms of the remaining coupling parameters @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the position of the @xmath39th dimer , and the prime indicates that the dominating interaction @xmath46 is excluded from the sum , @xmath47 .",
    "when the interactions between the dimers are neglected , the hamiltonian may be diagonalized exactly in terms of independent products of single - dimer eigenstates .",
    "the total spin of the @xmath39th dimer is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the cu spins belonging to , respectively , the sublattices 1 and 2 , or 3 and 4 .",

    "when @xmath60 the ground state is the non - magnetic singlet @xmath61 . in the present section we focus on this condition , and we shall assume that the system stays paramagnetic also in the presence of the interdimer interaction @xmath62 .",
    "the original hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) may be rewritten in terms of two dimer - spin variables , the sum @xmath63 and the difference @xmath64 .",
    "the sum operator only has non - zero matrix elements between the three excited @xmath14 states .",
    "we consider the case where the populations of these levels are small ( at sufficiently low temperatures in the disordered phase ) , in which case the dynamical effects due to @xmath65 are negligible .",

    "the present self - consistent rpa theory accounts reasonably well for the paramagnetic properties of the dimer system . within the mf model",

    "this minor discrepancy was neutralized by a small adjustment of the density of states of @xmath173 .",
    "actually , it would have been a surprise if the self - consistent rpa theory had been able to predict the right critical field without any adjustments . in all circumstances , it is clear that the theory needs to be corrected due to critical fluctuations , since the self - consistent rpa predicts the phase transition to the antiferromagnetic phase to be of first order in contradiction with experiment .",
    "the dimer system has a number of unusual magnetic properties .",
    "the most outstanding one is that the system is driven into the phase of antiferromagnetic order by the application of a uniform field .",
    "another unusual property shown by the ordered phase is that the bulk magnetization increases , when the temperature is lowered at a constant field , as this happens in spite of the fact that the `` degrees of freedom '' are being reduced because of the accompanying enhancement of the antiferromagnetic order parameter . this behavior is not in accordance with the mf model , whereas the self - consistent rpa theory accounts , at least , qualitatively for this observation .",
    "the self - consistent theory of the ordered phase is complicated , and we have been forced to neglect a number of effects .",
    "one of the complications , which has not been mentioned above , is that the matrix elements of @xmath293 between the ground state and the excited states are no longer zero in the ordered state implying additional modifications of all normal modes of the system ( the two classes of modes may mix because the cu sites lack inversion symmetry ) .",
    "we may also add that the non - zero values of the diagonal elements of @xmath285 in the ordered phase effectively give rise to additional contributions to @xmath224 and @xmath294 .",
    "fortunately , these extra complications should be unimportant within the regime of low temperatures and small order parameter , where the theory is applied .",
    "the approximations made for @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ e27 ] ) are only acceptable , when the renormalization effects due to this term are small .",
    "this term is handled in a more rigorous way by a diagrammatic high - density expansion.@xcite to first order in @xmath295 ( where @xmath52 is the number of interacting neighbors ) , the diagrammatic theory may be formulated in a self - consistent , `` effective medium '' fashion , which is the equivalent of the present , self - consistently improved version of rpa.@xcite this @xmath295 theory has been applied to the ising systems hof@xmath2 and lihof@xmath296,@xcite and in these cases the phase transitions are predicted to remain of second order .",
    "therefore , we expect that the use of the @xmath295 expansion theory , to first order in @xmath295 , is going to reproduce the self - consistent rpa results derived here for the paramagnetic phase , and should lead to an improved description of the ordered phase .",
    "the present rpa theory establishes a classification of the renormalization effects , which affect the properties of this quantum - critical dimer system .",

    "the degree of mixing depends on wave vector and on field , and is important for the characterization of the bosons in the condensate .",
