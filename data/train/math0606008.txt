    "a _ tame _ knot or link type is one that can be represented by a polygonal space curve . it is clear that the corners of a polygon can be rounded off , so that a can also be represented by a smooth , even  @xmath0 , curve .",
    "conversely , given a @xmath1 curve , it is relatively easy to find an isotopic inscribed polygon . with less smoothness , the arguments become more intricate but are by now standard .",
    "crowell and fox ( * ? ? ?",
    "i ) gave a detailed proof for @xmath2 curves , while milnor  @xcite introduced the class of _ finite total curvature ( / ) curves _ , and showed they also have isotopic inscribed polygons .",
    "thus any embedded / curve represents a tame link type ; but tame links ( even the unknot ) can of course also be represented by curves of infinite total curvature or even infinite length .",
    "however , our work in has suggested to us that / links are a very useful class , which might be considered as `` geometrically tame '' .",
    "( see  @xcite , in this volume , for a survey on / curves .",
    "we show for instance that this is the natural class for standard results like schur s comparison theorem . )    here , with a view towards convergence results in geometric knot theory , we examine the question of how close two space curves must be in order to be ( ambient ) isotopic .",
    "of course , the phenomenon of local knotting means that our notion of distance between space curves must control tangent directions as well as position .",
    "( otherwise , within any distance  @xmath3 of any knot there would be infinitely many composite knots  with extra summands contained in @xmath3-balls  and even certain prime satellites of the original knot . )",
    "we also show that , when the initial curves are close enough , the ambient isotopy can be made arbitrarily small .    the arguments of  @xcite not only produce one isotopic inscribed polygon , but in fact show that all sufficiently fine inscribed polygons are isotopic to a given @xmath2 or / curve . we recover this result , since finely inscribed polygons are nearby in our sense ( with one caveat , discussed later ) .",
    "we prove three versions of our theorem .",
    "the first is restricted curves of positive thickness , that is , to @xmath4 links , but it allows us to get nearly optimal bounds ( in terms of the thickness ) for how close the two curves must be before they are guaranteed to be isotopic . the second version , our main theorem , applies not just to links but to arbitrary knotted / graphs ; it gives us control over the distance points are moved by the isotopy .",
    "the final version applies to @xmath2 links and allows us to prove that the isotopy is small even in a stronger @xmath2 sense .    as an application of the main theorem",
    ", we consider the notion of essential arcs and secants of a knot , defined  @xcite in terms of certain knotted @xmath5-graphs .",
    "we show that essential secants remain essential in limits , which is important for results  @xcite on quadrisecants .",
    "a _ ( knotted ) rectifiable graph _ is a ( multi-)graph  of fixed finite combinatorial type  embedded in space such that each edge is a rectifiable arc .",
    "an _ / graph _ is a rectifiable graph where each arc has finite total curvature .",
    "we note that taniyama  @xcite has considered minimization of the total curvature of knotted graphs , including analogs of the fry / milnor theorem .    for an introduction to the theory of knotted graphs , see  @xcite : in particular , we are interested in graphs with what kauffman calls topological ( rather than rigid ) vertices .",
    "the @xmath6 edges incident to a vertex  @xmath7 can be braided arbitrarily near  @xmath7 without affecting the knot type of the graph .",
    "we do not require our graphs to be connected , so our results apply to links as well as knots .",
    "as mentioned above , in order to conclude that nearby knots are isotopic , we need to use a notion of distance that controls tangent vectors . a standard notion would be , for instance , @xmath2convergence of @xmath2  curves .",
    "our goal , however , is to consider curves which need not be  @xmath2 . recalling that a rectifiable curve has a well - defined tangent vector almost everywhere",
    ", we can make the following definition .    given two rectifiable embeddings @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the same combinatorial graph , we say they are _",
    "@xmath10close _ if there exists a homeomorphism between them such that corresponding points are within distance  @xmath11 of each other , and corresponding tangent vectors are within angle  @xmath12 of each other almost everywhere .    remember  @xcite that any curve or graph  @xmath8 of finite total curvature has well - defined one - sided tangent vectors everywhere ; these are equal and opposite except at countably many _ corners _ of  @xmath8 ( including of course the vertices of the graph ) . in the definition of @xmath10close",
    "it would be equivalent  in the case of / or piecewise  @xmath2 graphs  to require that the one - sided tangent vectors be _ everywhere _ within angle  @xmath12 .",
    "our first isotopy result looks at thick curves ( that is , embedded @xmath4 curves ) . here",
    "we can get close to optimal bounds on the  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 needed to conclude that nearby curves are isotopic .    the _ thickness _",
    "@xmath13 of a space curve  @xmath14 is defined  @xcite to be twice the infimal radius of circles through any three distinct points of  @xmath14 .",
    "a link is  @xmath4 ( that is , @xmath2 with lipschitz tangent vector , or equivalently with a weak curvature bound ) if and only if it has positive thickness  @xcite .",
    "of course when  @xmath14 is  @xmath2 , we can define normal tubes around  @xmath14 , and then @xmath13 is the supremal diameter of such a tube that remains embedded .",
    "( we note that in the existing literature thickness is sometimes defined to be the radius rather than diameter of this thick tube . )",
    "points inside the tube have a unique nearest neighbor on  @xmath14 : the tube s radius is also the _ reach _ of  @xmath14 in the sense of federer  @xcite .    fix a link  @xmath14 of thickness @xmath15 . any other link which follows  @xmath14 once around within its thick tube , transverse to the normal disks ,",
    "will be isotopic to  @xmath14 .",
    "this might seem to say that any link @xmath16close to  @xmath14 is isotopic , but this would only work if we knew the correspondence used in the definition of closeness were the closest - point projection to  @xmath14 .",
    "we do see that @xmath10closeness is no guarantee of isotopy if @xmath17 ( allowing local knotting ) or if @xmath18 ( allowing global strand passage ) .",
    "so the following proposition ( which extends lemma  6.1 from  @xcite , with essentially the same proof ) is certainly close to optimal .",
    "( we note , however , that @xmath18 only allows global strand passage in the case where the thickness of  @xmath14 is controlled by self - distance rather than curvature .",
    "this caveat explains why we can later get some analogs of the following proposition even for curves whose thickness is zero because they have corners . )",
    "[ pr : c11isot ] fix a @xmath4 link  @xmath14 of thickness @xmath15 . for any @xmath19 , set @xmath20 .",

    "let @xmath27 be the ( unique ) closest point on  @xmath14 to  @xmath24 .",
    "then of course @xmath28 , so @xmath29 .",
    "standard results on the geometry of thick curves  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.1 ) show that the arclength of  @xmath14 between  @xmath25 and  @xmath27 is at most @xmath30 , so by the curvature bound , the angle between the tangents @xmath31 and  @xmath32 at these two points is at most @xmath33 .",
    "the definition of @xmath10close means that the tangent vector ( if any ) to  @xmath21 at  @xmath24 makes angle less than  @xmath12 with  @xmath31 , so by definition of  @xmath12 it makes angle less than  @xmath34 with  @xmath32 .",
    "this shows that @xmath21 is transverse to the foliation of the thick tube around  @xmath14 by normal disks .",
    "we now construct the isotopy from  @xmath21 to  @xmath14 as the union of isotopies in these disks ; on each disk we move @xmath24 to  @xmath27 , coning this outwards to the fixed boundary . no point in the disk moves further than @xmath24 does , and this is less than  @xmath11 .",
    "when generalizing our isotopy results to knotted graphs , we must allow corners at the vertices of the graph , so it is natural to consider / graphs with possibly additional corners along the arcs .",
    "our main theorem will again show that sufficiently close curves are isotopic .",
    "any curve with a corner has zero thickness  @xmath35 , so it is perhaps surprising that an analog of still holds .",
    "perhaps the maximum possible value of  @xmath11 here could be taken as a different notion thickness of the curve ; we do not explore this idea , but content ourselves with merely proving the existence of some positive  @xmath11 .",
    "a preliminary combing lemma allows the main theorem to treat vertices on knotted graphs as well as sharp corners along a single strand .",
    "it was inspired by alexander and bishop s correction  @xcite to milnor s treatment of corners of angle  @xmath36 .",
    "this case  where two or more strands leave a corner in the same direction , allowing infinite winding or braiding  is the most difficult , and seems to be the obstacle to creating an isotopy which is @xmath10small in the sense described in section  [ sec : small ] . but this case does not need to be treated separately in our proof .",
    "this combing lemma is an example of the `` '' ( compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2.10 ) ) .",
    "in general the trick shows that any homeomorphism of the unit @xmath37-ball which fixes the boundary is isotopic to the identity .    [ lem : strball ] let @xmath38 be a round ball centered at  @xmath25 , and suppose graphs @xmath8 and  @xmath9 each consist of @xmath39 labeled arcs starting at  @xmath25 and proceeding out to  @xmath40 transverse to the nested spheres around  @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath8 and  @xmath9 are ambient isotopic .",
    "in fact , any isotopy of  @xmath40 which takes the @xmath39 points of  @xmath8 to those of  @xmath9 can be extended to an isotopy of the whole ball .",

    "then the same is true of @xmath9 , and any two straight configurations are clearly isotopic ( for instance by extending radially any given boundary isotopy ) .    to straighten @xmath8",

    "the combing isotopy , at each time  @xmath50 , maps each concentric sphere @xmath43 to itself , using the map @xmath51 .",

    "we begin by selecting a finite number of points  @xmath59 on  @xmath8 ( including all its vertices ) such that these points divide  @xmath8 into arcs  @xmath60 each of total curvature less than  @xmath61 .",

    "thus @xmath69 is within angle @xmath76 of being normal to the foliation ; in particular it is transverse .",
    "finally , we set @xmath77 and , for each point @xmath78 , we consider the foliating sphere through  @xmath79 and in particular its intersection with  @xmath80 , a ( slightly curved ) disk  @xmath81 .",

    "now take @xmath86 and consider some  @xmath9 which is @xmath58close to  @xmath8 .",
    "we will see that  @xmath9 lies within our neighborhood  @xmath84 and is also transverse to the foliation  @xmath85 , except perhaps near the  @xmath59 . to find an ambient isotopy from  @xmath9 to  @xmath8",
    ", we proceed in two stages .",
    "first we find the points @xmath87 corresponding to @xmath88 , and construct an isotopy @xmath89 supported in the @xmath64 as follows : the map moves each point along a straight line ; @xmath90 moves to @xmath59 , each boundary point @xmath91 is fixed , and the map is linear on each segment @xmath92 . because @xmath9 was @xmath58close to  @xmath8 , and because @xmath90 was so close to @xmath59 compared to the radius  @xmath65 of  @xmath64 , the resulting @xmath93 at time  @xmath55 has radial strands within each  @xmath64 , so we will be able to use the combing lemma .",
    "in fact , we claim that  @xmath94 is contained in  @xmath84 and transverse to the foliation  @xmath85 .",
    "the original correspondence between  @xmath9 and  @xmath8 ( showing they were @xmath58close ) did not pair points in the same leaf of the foliation .",
    "but outside the  @xmath64 , for each point  @xmath95 on the arc of @xmath96 corresponding to  @xmath69 , consider the leaf of the foliation it lies in and the unique point @xmath97 on the same leaf .",
    "the distance @xmath98 might be slightly bigger than the distance @xmath99 in the original pairing .",
    "however , since the angles of the curves and the foliation are so well controlled , it is certainly well less than  @xmath100 ; the tangent directions at  @xmath79 and  @xmath101 are certainly within @xmath61 of each other .",
    "that is , even under the new correspondance ( @xmath95  to  @xmath101 ) these arcs of  @xmath9 and  @xmath8 are @xmath102close .",
    "this proves the claim .",
    "second , we construct an isotopy  @xmath103 which is supported in  @xmath84 and which preserves each leaf of the foliation  @xmath85 . on the disks in the tubes",
    "@xmath71 this is easy : we have to move one given point in the disk to the center , and can choose to do this in a continuous way .",
    "on the boundary @xmath104 we define @xmath103 to match these motions in the disks and fix the rest of the sphere .",
    "finally , we use to fill in the isotopy  @xmath103 in the interior of the balls .    by construction ,",
    "the overall isotopy  @xmath89 followed by  @xmath103 moves points less than  @xmath3 , as desired : within each ball  @xmath64 we have little control over the details but certainly each point moves less than the diameter @xmath105 ; within  @xmath71 each point moves less than @xmath106 .    even though we have emphasized the class of / curves",
    ", we note that a very similar proof could be given for the case when @xmath8 is piecewise  @xmath2 .",
    "we would simply choose the points  @xmath59 such that the intervening arcs  @xmath60 , while potentially of infinite total curvature , had tangent vectors staying within angle  @xmath61 of the vector between their endpoints .",
    "compare the beginning of the proof of below .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , we can recover the following result : given any / ( or  @xmath2 ) link , any sufficiently fine is isotopic .",
    "when the link is  @xmath2 , this is an immediate corollary , sine the polygon will be @xmath10close . for an / link  @xmath14 with corners ,",
    "even very finely inscribed polygons will typically cut those corners and thus deviate by more than angle  @xmath107 from the tangent directions of  @xmath14 .",
    "but , using near those sharp corners , we see immediately that the polygon is isotopic to one that does use the corner as a vertex , and thus to  @xmath14 .",
    "remember that a is one isotopic to a polygon .",
    "tame links clearly satisfy the following local condition .    a link @xmath14 is if each point @xmath108 has a neighborhood  @xmath109 such that @xmath110 is an unknotted ball - arc pair .",
    "( unknotted means that the pair is homeomorphic to a round ball with its diameter . )",
    "we can generalize the definitions to knotted graphs .",
    "a knotted graph @xmath8 is _ tame _ if it is isotopic to a polygonal embedding ; it is _ locally flat _ if each point @xmath111 has a neighborhood  @xmath109 such that @xmath112 is homeomorphic to a standard model . at a @xmath6-fold vertex",
    "this standard model is a round ball with @xmath6 of its radii ; along an arc of @xmath8 it is an unknotted ball - arc pair .",
    "again , tame graphs are clearly locally flat . in the mid-1950s , bing  @xcite and moise  @xcite independently proved the much more difficult converse : any locally flat graph is tame .",
    "our main theorem showed that an / graph is isotopic to any other nearby graph .",
