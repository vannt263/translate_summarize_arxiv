    "the drell  yan process @xcite is an excellent probe of the proton structure in proton - proton or proton  anti - proton collisions . in this process a lepton ",
    "antilepton pair is produced by an intermediate neutral electroweak boson : virtual @xmath12 or by a quasi - real or virtual heavy boson @xmath1 .",
    "the lepton ",
    "antilepton pair distributions from this process can be well measured over a wide range of kinematical parameters providing data on the drell  yan structure functions @xmath13 that depend on the pair invariant mass , total transverse momentum and rapidity , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "four independent structure functions @xmath13 parametrize the @xmath14 or the parity conserving @xmath1 contribution , and five more structure functions are necessary to describe the odd - parity @xmath1 contributions .",
    "various drell  yan observables were measured recently at the lhc , for example the drell  yan mass distribution @xcite , the transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath1 boson @xcite , and the coefficients of the lepton angular distributions at the @xmath1 peak @xcite .",
    "in particular the atlas collaboration measured with excellent precision all the drell  yan structure functions at the resonant @xmath1 production peak @xcite , that is for @xmath15 , as functions of the lepton pair transverse momentum , @xmath16 . both the total cross - section and most of the measured structure functions were found consistent with the theoretical predictions of perturbative qcd at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite .",
    "a striking exception from this agreement was found , however , in the lam ",
    "tung combination of the structure functions proportional to a difference of the lepton angular distribution coefficients , @xmath0 ( for the explicit definition see sec .  [ sec:3a ] ) where the experimental measurement of @xmath5 reaches about 0.15 for @xmath17 , and the nnlo qcd prediction provides about half of this value in this region of @xmath16 .",
    "this discrepancy is clearly visible for about 10  experimental data points of @xmath5 with typical experimental errors of about @xmath18 .",
    "tung combination of drell  yan structure functions is particularly interesting probe of subtle qcd effects .",
    "it follows from the fact that it vanishes at the leading twist up to the nlo in the collinear approximation .",
    "thus , the lam ",
    "tung relation breaking may occur through higher twist effects or by qcd effects at the nnlo and beyond .",
    "for this reason @xmath5 has been considered to be a promising probe of higher twist effects in the drell  yan process at small lepton pair masses , and at very high hadron collision energies @xcite .",
    "tung relation breaking may occur however , also at the leading twist as a result of the parton transverse momenta @xcite .",
    "in particular it was demonstrated  @xcite that the lam ",
    "tung relation breaks down when both the quark and antiquark carry non - zero transverse momenta at the quark ",
    "antiquark  electroweak boson vertex .",
    "in the collinear framework such transverse momenta may be generated at higher orders , when additional emissions occur in the hard matrix element . in the @xmath2-factorization framework @xcite , however , already the incoming partons have non - zero transverse momenta .",
    "hence the lam ",
    "tung breaking coefficient @xmath5 is sensitive to the details of the transverse momentum distribution of the incoming partons an may be used to probe parton transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) . on the other hand , the angular distributions of dileptons in heavy electroweak boson hadroproductions may be used to probe anomalous couplings of the bosons to quarks @xcite , and a good control of the qcd effects in these observables is necessary to enhance the sensitivity of the probes .    the parton tmds  in particular the gluon tmd  parameterize important properties of the proton structure and allow to test and improve the qcd evolution equations with transverse momentum dependence , e.g.  the balisky  fadin  kuraev",
    " lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite or catani  ciafaloni  fiorani  marchesini ( ccfm ) @xcite evolution equations . in the standard form and notation , the gluon tmd @xmath19 , depends on the gluon @xmath6 and @xmath2 , and on the factorization scale @xmath20 .",
    "the parton tmds provide valuable insight into proton structure and properties of qcd  for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "their accurate determination is also important as the @xmath2-factorization formalism when applicable , may represent the scattering process kinematics more accurately than collinear qcd at given order of perturbation theory . thus with better control of parton",
    "tmds a more precise description of hadron scattering should be possible .",
    "currently there exist many parameterizations of the gluon tmd with significantly different properties and it is important to find and probe observables sensitive to parton tmds and to constrain the distributions @xcite .",
    "the drell  yan process was analyzed within the @xmath2-factorization framework in two main approaches .",
    "hence , the forward drell  yan cross - sections may be described in terms of the color ",
    "dipole formulation @xcite of the @xmath2-factorization framework @xcite . in this approach",
    "a quasi - compton emission of the electroweak boson from a fast ( collinear ) quark scattering by an off - shell gluon exchange takes place . in the other approach",
    "adopted e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite , an off - shell quark and antiquark fusion into the electroweak boson is considered . in the former approach the gluon tmd enters , while in the latter the quark and antiquark tmds are used .",
    "the @xmath2-factorization framework is quite successful in both the approaches in describing drell  yan observables integrated over the lepton angles , but it does not give satisfactory description of all the drell  yan structure functions .",
    "thus , we propose an extension of the two approaches to include also a @xmath21 partonic channel contribution to the drell  yan cross sections , that enters at the nnlo and was not considered yet .    in conclusion , in this paper",
    "we analyze sensitivity of @xmath5 to the shape of quark and gluon tmds within the @xmath2-factorization framework .",
    "we take into account both the lowest order contribution to the process , given by a simple fusion of quark and antiquark that both carry non - zero transverse momentum @xmath2 , and channels that enter at higher orders of qcd ( assuming the fixed order perturbative expansion ) .",
    "namely these are the already known quark  gluon channel and the gluon ",
    "gluon channel computed in this paper .",
    "the calculations are performed in the high energy limit in which the parton evolution towards small  @xmath6 is driven by the gluon evolution .",
    "we consider gluon tmds emerging from solutions of the @xmath2-dependent evolution equations , bfkl and ccfm , and coming from qcd inspired models .",
    "as none of the probed existing quark and gluon tmds gives satisfactory description @xmath5 , we also introduce new simple qcd inspired model of the gluon tmd which provides a good estimate of the lam ",
    "tung relation breaking at large @xmath1 transverse momentum , that is for @xmath17 and a reasonably good estimate for smaller transverse momenta .",
    "this model is based on a simple concept of the gluon tmd at moderately small gluon @xmath6 and at large gluon @xmath2 , to be driven by the weizscker ",
    "williams gluon emission from valence quarks , resulting in @xmath22 behavior of the gluon tmd @xmath19 at large @xmath2 .",
    "we verify that this `` weizscker  williams '' model of the gluon tmd provides not only a reasonable description of @xmath5 at the @xmath1 peak , but also an excellent description of the drell  yan pair mass @xmath23 distribution shape , probed by recent atlas measurements in the range of 15  gev  @xmath24  55  gev .",
    "furthermore we demonstrate that @xmath16-dependence of @xmath5 at the @xmath1 peak is highly sensitive to the shape of the gluon tmd at large @xmath2 and hence this observable may be used to constrain gluon tmd with very competitive precision .",
    "the diagrams in this paper are drawn with jaxodraw @xcite . [",

    "proton collision with a lepton ",
    "antilepton pair , @xmath25 or @xmath26 , in the final state , @xmath27 , and the leptons four - momenta @xmath28 and @xmath29 are measured , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kinem ] . the lepton four - momenta",
    "are denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath29 and @xmath28 correspondingly . at the leading order in the electroweak coupling constants this process",

    "the four - momenta of proton projectiles are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and they are near light - like  in the center of mass system ( c.m.s . ) of the @xmath38 pair and in the standard minkovskian coordinates , one has @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where the invariant collision energy squared @xmath41 is much greater than the proton mass squared , @xmath42 . in what follows ,",
    "the effects of non - zero @xmath43 are neglected .",
    "we define light - like components of a four - vector @xmath44 as @xmath45 , where the @xmath46-axis is given by the beam direction in the proton - proton c.m.s . from now on we shall use the light - cone coordinates for four - vectors , @xmath47 , and a perpendicular part @xmath48 of four - vector @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in the light - cone coordinates one has @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and in what follows the sudakov decomposition of four - vectors is employed , @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , for the dy intermediate electroweak boson one has @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is equal to the boson feynman @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is determined from the mass constraint , @xmath59 , and the boson transverse mass squared @xmath60 . the boson rapidity in the laboratory frame is @xmath61 .    in this paper",
    "the intermediate boson polarization vectors are defined in the collins  soper frame @xcite through normalized four - vectors @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 given in the following way ( note that differently to the rest of the paper , in the formulas below the @xmath65 labels do not denote the light - cone components of the four vectors ) : x^ = -m q_t m_t ( a_(+ ) p^ _ ( + ) + a_(- ) p^ _ ( - ) ) , z^ = 1m_t ( a_(- ) p^ _ ( + ) + a_(+ ) p^ _ ( - ) ) , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath63 is defined by orthogonality and normalization conditions : @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "hence the collins - soper polarization four - vectors are : _ ( 0 ) ^ = z^ , ^ _ ( ) = ( x^ iy^ ) .",

    "antilepton pair production at the lhc receives contributions from @xmath71 and @xmath1 or @xmath72 exchange amplitudes .",
    "the contributions from @xmath71 are parity conserving , and from @xmath1 include both parity conserving and parity violating terms . in the present paper",
    "we do not consider the odd - parity effects coming from the @xmath1 exchange as they do not affect the lam ",

    "it is straightforward to express the coefficients @xmath86 through the boson hadroproduction cross - sections @xmath88 .",
    "the results read : a_0 = _ l _ t + _ l / 2 , a_1 = _ lt _ t + _ l / 2 , a_2 = 2_tt_t + _ l / 2 , where @xmath89 stands for suitably integrated @xmath88 .    note that in the parity conserving part of the drell  yan cross - section the @xmath1  boson hadroproduction cross - sections are proportional to the @xmath14  hadroproduction cross - sections . at the amplitude level ,",
    "the photon coupling @xmath90 to a quark of flavor @xmath91 is proportional to the quark charge @xmath92 , while the quark coupling to the @xmath1 boson is @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the vector and axial - vector quark couplings to the @xmath1 boson . in the parity",
    "even cross - sections the @xmath96 may be anticommuted and eliminated from the amplitudes squared and the resulting expressions are proportional to the virtual photon production cross - sections , with a substitution @xmath97 .      in this paper",
    "we describe the drell  yan amplitudes within the @xmath2-factorization framework , in which the high - energy limit is employed .",
    "this limit combined with the ( fixed order ) perturbative expansion of scattering amplitudes allows for a systematic selection of leading diagrams that contribute to the scattering amplitudes .    the typical value of parton  @xmath6 in drell ",
    "yan processes at the lhc at @xmath98  tev is @xmath99 for masses up to the @xmath1 peak and the boson transverse momentum @xmath100  gev . in this range of @xmath6 the quark distributions",
    "are dominated by the sea quarks , and for @xmath38 collisions antiquarks come entirely from the sea . due to the spin of @xmath101 the exchange of quarks and antiquarks in",
    "the @xmath102-channel decreases exponentially with the exchange rapidity span , while the spin  1 gluon exchange amplitude grows with the rapidity span .",
    "this motivates the standard high energy approximation in which the sea parton evolution is driven by the evolution of the exchanged gluon density , and the sea quarks that enter the hard matrix element are generated in the matrix element , or in the last step of parton evolution as a result of the gluon splitting . in our analysis",
    "we adopt this approximation .    in the collinear approximation",
    "the following channels contribute to the neutral electroweak ( real or virtual ) boson @xmath83 production in @xmath38 collisions :    * from the lo : @xmath103 ; * from the nlo : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 ; * from the nnlo : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    in the high energy approximation described above the sea ( anti-)quarks enter only in the hard matrix element ,",
    "so from the partonic channels up to the nnlo , one is left with contributions of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath113 . in the high energy limit",
    "the channel @xmath116 is driven by a gluon exchange between the valence quarks and is absorbed into the @xmath114 channel , as the gluon distribution contains gluon emissions from valence quarks .",
    "the contribution of @xmath114 to the boson production cross - section carries the first power of @xmath117 , and both @xmath115 and @xmath113 enter at @xmath118 . in the considered regime of parton @xmath119 , however , due to the gluon distribution being much greater than the distribution of the valence quarks , the contribution of @xmath113 is expected to be much larger than @xmath115 so we neglect the latter .",
    "thus , the two dominant channels in the high energy limit are : @xmath120 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : channels]b ) ) , and @xmath113 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : channels]c ) ) . in our approach , which includes the treatment of non - zero gluon transverse momentum @xmath2 , the incoming gluons are virtual and from now on will be denoted by @xmath121 , and the gluon density in the proton will be parameterized in terms of the gluon transverse momentum distribution @xmath122 .",
    "the valence quark distributions are expected to have much narrower distribution in the transverse momentum , so for the valence quarks we keep the collinear approximation , which is viewed in our approach as the zero - width limit of the corresponding quark tmd .",
    "the partonic diagram selection based on the gluon exchange dominance in the high - energy limit may be related to the rigorous systematic expansion of the collinear approach .",
    "thus , the @xmath123 hard matrix element contains the lo dglap @xmath124 splitting combined with the lo @xmath125 matrix element , the contribution of the nlo @xmath126 term and contributions beyond the collinear nlo level that emerge because of the exact treatment of parton kinematics . on the other hand , the loop corrections to @xmath103 amplitude",
    "are neglected , that also contribute to collinear nlo approximation . for the @xmath127 channel , the hard matrix element accounts for the collinear lo",
    "@xmath128 contribution preceded by @xmath129 and @xmath130 dglap splittings , the nlo contributions @xmath131 and @xmath132 , preceded by @xmath129 or @xmath130 dglap splittings , the leading contribution to the nnlo collinear matrix element @xmath113 , and some contributions beyond the dglap nnlo coming from the exact treatment of parton scattering kinematics .",
    "again , loop corrections are not included in this treatment .",
    "hence our approximation is expected to cover the leading contributions to the collinear partonic channels @xmath125 , @xmath120 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath113 .",
    "these channels are dominant ones in the neutral electroweak boson production , and certain loss of completeness w.r.t .",
    "the existing collinear nnlo calculation is justified by more accurate treatment of parton scattering kinematics in the @xmath2-factorization approach .",

    "all the models predictions have similar shapes to the data but they do not describe the data within experimental errors . among these models the best simultaneous description of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is obtained with the ww  gluon tmd .",
    "this model results agree with the data for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 within errors except of a region of intermediate @xmath1 boson momenta , between 5  gev and 50  gev , where the ww model slightly overestimates the data for both coefficients .    to summarize , from the simultaneous analysis of @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the @xmath1 peak and @xmath133 one concludes that the proposed ww model of the gluon tmd describes reasonably well all these observables , and provides a competitive or the best description among the studied models of the data over most of the kinematical range .",
    "the main conclusions coming from the analysis of the lam  tung relation breaking at the @xmath1 peak within an approximate nnlo @xmath2-factorization approach are the following : ( i ) the gluon off - shellness effects have an essential impact on @xmath5 up to the nnlo in qcd ; ( ii ) the angular distributions of drell  yan dileptons provide a sensitive probe of the gluon tmd with high discrimination power ; ( iii ) for a correct description of the lam ",
    "tung relation breaking at large boson momenta it is essential to use a gluon tmd with a hard @xmath134 behavior at large @xmath2 .",
    "the validity of these conclusions relies upon the important assumption of our approach that the performed selection of the nnlo contributions does not affect the results significantly .",
    "in fact , on the top of the applied high - energy approximation , the terms of @xmath135 and one loop corrections to @xmath136 are not taken into account .",
    "these important terms are not treated in the present paper as the one loop computations in @xmath2-factorization framework still pose a serious theoretical challenge that deserves a separate study .",
    "it may be argued , however , that the neglected terms should not alter our main conclusions .",
    "the key argument comes from the dominance of the @xmath137 channel over the @xmath138 channel in the total drell  yan cross - section at @xmath1 peak over most of the boson transverse momentum range , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ratioqgatz ] .",
    "next , the one loop corrections to @xmath136 and the contribution of the nnlo channel @xmath135 combine together into the @xmath139 correction to the @xmath123 channel ( this combination is necessary to be performed , as it is needed for the cancellation of infra - red divergences ) .",
    "so , the two neglected contributions of the nnlo enter only as a @xmath139 correction to a sub - dominant partonic channel .",
    "therefore neglecting these terms should have only a limited impact on the predicted observables and should not affect the main features of the result .",
    "moreover the approximation applied should work with even better accuracy for smaller dy dilepton masses and/or for larger beam collision energy @xmath140 .",
    "still it is a natural and desired direction of further analysis to complete the calculation of nnlo drell  yan cross - section in the @xmath2-factorization framework .",
    "the description of @xmath5 obtained in this paper is not perfect yet and the application of a phenomenological model of the gluon tmd for the best description is not fully satisfactory . the next steps in this direction should be to combine the extracted information on the relevance of the weizscker  williams picture of the gluon tmd emerging as consequence of the gluon emissions from the point - like partons at larger  @xmath6 , with a qcd evolution equations for the off - shell gluon density .",
    "this may be done e.g.  by an extension of the kms formalism to larger  @xmath6 or by suitably adjusting the input and non - uniform terms in the gluon tmd evolution .",
    "it is interesting to note that the approximation of the @xmath127 matrix element by a hard matrix element with virtual quarks @xmath141 preceded by the splitting of the off - shell gluons , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , does not work well in theoretical estimates of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath5 . it should be interesting to identify the reason why this approximation is not accurate in this application .",
    "taking into account variety and precision of already performed and coming measurements of dy lepton observables and their sensitivity to the gluon tmd features , and should serve as the key data set for constraining parton transverse momentum distributions .",
