    "if this is the case , by measuring the b - field dependence of the two - photon rabi frequency , one should observe a non - monotonic @xmath137 dependence : the rabi frequency should grow as half of the larmor frequency approaches the valley splitting either from above or from below . even if we did not perform a systematic study of the @xmath138 vs @xmath1 , from the measurement we recorded we can exclude this striking dependence .    in the absence of detailed knowledge of the shape of the confining potential , it is difficult to quantitatively estimate the magnitude of this effect .",
    "however , what we can say is that the details of the confining potential strongly influence the efficiency of second harmonic driving : after tuning the device into a new gate voltage configuration ( for which the valley splitting is higher than it is here ) , it has not been possible to observe again clear signatures of second harmonic driving .",
    "the new settings will likely also shift the average dot position in the micro magnet stray field , thereby altering the tilt of the effective driving field as well as the position dependent field gradient . however , as discussed in the preceding sections , these two effects are several orders of magnitude too small to explain the observed second harmonic driving . if the degree of anharmonicity of the confining potential dominates second harmonic driving , control of the anharmonicity will be required to make routine use of second harmonic driving in future spin qubit experiments ."

    "<S> we see that for driving at the frequency of the second harmonic , the rabi frequency is quadratic in the applied electric field amplitude ( linear in power ) , as expected from theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when driving at the fundamental resonance , the rabi frequency is linear in the driving amplitude , as usual . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that at the highest power used in this experiment the rabi frequency obtained from driving the fundamental valley - orbit ground state spin resonance is just a factor of two higher than the one from driving at the second harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio indicates that the use of second harmonic driving is quite efficient in our device .    a further peculiarity in coherent driving using second harmonics is seen when we vary the phase of two consecutive microwave bursts . </S>",

    "<S> to summarize , we report coherent second harmonic driving of an electron spin qubit defined in a si / sige quantum dot , including universal single - spin rotations . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linearity that permits second harmonic driving is likely related to the anharmonic confining potential for the electron . </S>",

    "<S> this could be very useful since driving a spin qubit at half its larmor frequency would substantially simplify the microwave engineering required for high fidelity qubit control .    </S>",
