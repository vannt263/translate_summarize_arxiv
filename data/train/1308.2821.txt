    "our calculation is based on the above master equation , without making the markovian approximation , i.e. , replacing the upper limit of the time integral as infinity , as in some previous studies .",

    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath179 assuming the two independent baths possess the same autocorrelation function , i.e. , @xmath180 , we found that the decoherence no longer depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath7 , and that the spectrum - induced phase shift @xmath181 .",
    "the general feature of @xmath109 observed above is still valid now .",
    "however , the dephasing effect caused by low - frequency noise has been enhanced .",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the effect of decoherence on the berry phase by calculating the fidelity between the reduced density matrix of the system coupled with an environment and the exact state of a closed system , both starting from a same initial state .",
    "this approach does not rely on any definition of the geometric phase in a mixed state .",
    "we use the master equation without any constraint on the correlation time of the bath , hence our discussions cover both the non - markovian dynamics and markovian limit .",
    "it is found that in the adiabatic limit , with a high frequency quantum noise , the deviation of the fidelity from @xmath135 is quite small , implying that the berry phase is robust . with a low frequency quantum noise , the fidelity",
    "is significantly lowered , implying that the berry phase is significantly degraded .",
    "our finding is beyond what can be obtained by making markovian approximation , and is in accordance with the experimental result  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the result is valid in the more general cases of an arbitrary path of the cycle and of the multi - noise .",
    "it is also noted that for the initial state considered , dephasing clearly dominates over the energy dissipation and the lamb shift .",
    "as the dephasing is path dependent , an optimal evolution loop can be chosen to protect the coherence .",
    "we hope that our analysis is useful for designing quantum gates based on geometric phases .",
    "finally , we note that it is interesting to combine the geometric phase approach with the dynamical decoupling approach  @xcite , where it is also found that non - markovian environmental noise causes phase randomization  @xcite .",
