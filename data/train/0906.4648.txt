    "formalizing the concept of shape for topological spaces and manifolds , as well as providing an efficient comparison of shapes , has been a widely researched topic in the last decade . as such",
    ", a class of methods has been developed with the purpose of performing a topological exploration of the shape , according to some quantitative geometric properties provided by a real function chosen to extract shape features @xcite .    in this",
    "context , size theory was introduced at the beginning of the 1990s @xcite , supported by the adoption of a suitable mathematical tool : the _ natural pseudo - distance _ @xcite .    in the formalism of size",
    "theory , a shape is modelled as a pair @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a topological space and @xmath2 is a continuous function @xcite .",
    "such a pair is called a _ size pair _ and @xmath3",
    "is called a _ measuring function_. the role of @xmath3 is to take into account only the properties considered relevant for the shape comparison problem at hand , while disregarding the irrelevant ones , as well as to impose the desired invariance properties .",
    "the natural pseudo - distance is a measure of the dissimilarity between two size pairs @xmath0 , @xmath4 .",
    "roughly speaking , it is defined as the infimum of the variation of the values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , when we move from @xmath1 to @xmath6 through homeomorphisms , if possible ( see definition [ pseudod ] ) .",
    "therefore , two objects have the same shape if they share the same shape properties , expressed by the measuring functions values , that is , their natural pseudo - distance vanishes .",
    "earlier results about the natural pseudo - distance can be divided into two classes .",
    "one class provides constraints on the possible values taken by the natural pseudo - distance between two size pairs @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath4 . for example",
    ", if the considered topological spaces @xmath1 and @xmath6 are smooth closed manifolds and the measuring functions are also smooth , then the natural pseudo - distance is an integer sub - multiple of the euclidean distance between two suitable critical values of the measuring functions @xcite . in particular",
    ", this integer can only be either 1 or 2 in the case of curves @xcite , while it can not be greater than 3 in the case of surfaces @xcite .",
    "the other class of results furnishes lower bounds for the natural pseudo - distance @xcite .",
    "in particular it is possible to estimate the natural pseudo - distance by using the concept of _ size function _ @xcite .",
    "size functions are shape descriptors able to reduce the comparison of shapes to the comparison of certain countable sets of points in the real plane @xcite .",
    "this reduction allows us to study the space of all homeomorphisms between the considered topological spaces , without actually computing them .",
    "the research on size functions has led to a formal setting , which has turned out to be useful , not only from a theoretical point of view , but also on the applicative side ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    besides being",
    "a useful theoretical tool for applications in shape comparison , the natural pseudo - distance is challenging from the mathematical point of view , and several questions about its properties need for further investigation .",
    "one among them consists in establishing the hypotheses ensuring the existence of _ optimal homeomorphisms _ between size pairs , i.e. homeomorphisms realizing the natural pseudo - distance .",
    "it is possible to show that , in general , such homeomorphisms do not exist ( see , e.g. , section [ examples ] ) .    in this paper , we provide the first available result about the existence of optimal homeomorphisms . to be more precise ,",
    "we prove that , under appropriate conditions , it is always possible to construct a homeomorphism between two closed curves ( i.e. compact and without boundary @xmath7-manifolds ) , satisfying the property of optimality ( theorem [ mainthm ] ) .",
    "this result can be seen as a necessary first step towards the study of this problem in a more general setting , e.g. when manifolds of arbitrary dimensions are involved .",
    "the subject of our work fits in the current mathematical research and interest in simple closed curves , motivated by problems concerning shape comparison in computer vision ( cf .",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is divided into three sections .",
    "section [ background ] deals with some of the standard facts on the comparison of size pairs via the natural pseudo - distance . in particular , the definition of the natural pseudo - distance @xmath8 and its main properties are given , focusing on the concept of @xmath9-approximating sequence .",
    "section [ examples ] is devoted to the description of some simple and meaningful examples showing that none of the conditions we require in stating our main result can be dropped . in section",

    "this deformation can be performed by an arbitrarily small change in the values of the height @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , a sequence of homeomorphisms @xmath23 from @xmath1 to @xmath6 can be constructed , such that @xmath81 .    however , no optimal homeomorphism exists between the two size pairs .",

    "similarly to the previous example , for every @xmath56 we first construct a homeomorphism @xmath57 , moving each point @xmath77 less then or equal to @xmath93 with respect to the measuring function @xmath43 .",

    "so , by the continuity of @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath17 , we can write @xmath249 and @xmath250 . moreover , by recalling once more that the restriction of @xmath17 to @xmath136 coincides with @xmath227 , and @xmath251 coincides with @xmath252 , we have @xmath253 .",
