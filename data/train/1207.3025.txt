    "galaxy clusters host several potential accelerators of cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and protons , from ordinary galaxies to active galaxies ( agn ) and cosmological shock waves , driven in the intracluster medium ( icm ) during the process of hierarchical cluster formation ( see blasi et al .",
    "2007 for a review ) .",

    "the accumulation of crs inside clusters over cosmological times leads to the assumption that an appreciable amount of energy may be stored in the icm in the form of non - thermal particles .",
    "if this energy is sufficiently high , the flux of @xmath0 radiation induced by the production and decay of neutral pions may reach potentially detectable levels , thereby providing us with a powerful diagnostic tool of the cr energy content of clusters ( colafrancesco & blasi 1998 , blasi & colafrancesco 1999 , vlk & atoyan 1999 , miniati 2003 , pfrommer & enlin 2004 , wolfe et al .",

    "cr electrons are very well traced in the icm through their radio emission which appears in the form of diffuse ( mpc scale ) synchrotron _ giant radio halos _ from the cluster x - ray emitting regions , and _ relics _",
    ", typically in the clusters peripheral regions ( see ferrari et al .",
    "2008 , venturi 2011 , for recent reviews on observations ) .",
    "giant radio halos are the most spectacular and best studied non - thermal large scale phenomena in the universe .",
    "they appear in about @xmath1 of the most massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. giovannini et al .",
    "1999 , kempner & sarazin 2001 , cassano et al .",
    "2008 ) , in a rather clear connection with dynamically disturbed systems , while `` off - state '' clusters ( those with no evidence of diffuse emission ) are generally more relaxed ( cassano et al .",
    "2010a and references therein ) .",
    "the connection between cluster mergers and radio halos suggests that such emission traces the hierarchical cluster assembly and probes the dissipation of gravitational energy during the dark matter - driven mergers that lead to the formation of clusters .",
    "the physical mechanisms responsible for the generation and evolution of radio halos are still a matter of debate , but two main lines of thought have been developed throughout the years .",
    "one is based on the idea that seed electrons may be re - accelerated by turbulence produced during merger events ( brunetti et al .",
    "2001 , petrosian 2001 ) . in this class of models",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission is predicted to be rather low , though it may be substantial under the hypothesis that the electron seeds are secondaries produced in inelastic collisions of a subdominant hadronic cr component in the icm ( brunetti & blasi 2005 ; brunetti & lazarian 2011 ) .",
    "the second line of thought is based on the idea of clusters as storage rooms of cr protons : the radio halos may be generated as a result of synchrotron emission of secondary electrons and positrons from pp collisions ( dennison 1980 , blasi & colafrancesco 1999 , pfrommer & enlin 2004 ) .",
    "on one hand this idea serves as a solution to the problem of the large spatial dimensions of the radio emitting region , larger than the typical loss length of electrons : secondary electrons and positrons are produced _ in situ _ in inelastic cr collisions and radiation is produced near the production region .",
    "on the other hand , secondary models do not explain in a _",
    "natural _ way the observed association between cluster mergers and giant radio halos , in that crs accumulate inside the icm on cosmological time scales and not in direct connection with acceleration events such as those associated with mergers .",
    "one proposal is that during merger events the cluster magnetic field becomes larger than in the quiescent state , thereby turning the halo on ( kushnir et al .",
    "2009 , keshet & loeb 2010 ) , although studies based on rotation measures of clusters and background radio sources disfavour this scenario ( see bonafede et al .  2011a and",
    "therein ) .",
    "in fact , some pieces of observations put tension on a _ pure _ hadronic origin of radio halos .",
    "these include the steepening in the spectrum ( or the very steep spectrum ) of several halos ( schlickeiser et al .",
    "1987 , thierbach et al .",
    "2003 , reimer et al .",
    "2004 , brunetti et al .",
    "2008 , dallacasa et al .",
    "2009 , giovannini et al .",
    "2009 , macario et al .",
    "2010 , van veeren et al . 2011 ) and the very large spatial extent of several halos ( or their flat radio - brightness distribution ) ( brunetti 2004 , murgia et al .",
    "2009 , donnert et al .",
    "2010a , brown & rudnick 2011 ) ; in all cases observations would imply that the energy budget of cr protons is uncomfortably large , at least assuming that clusters are magnetised at @xmath2 g level , consistent with the results of rm ( see bonafede et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "the most distinct prediction of models of radio halos that are based on secondary particles is the production of @xmath0rays ( e.g. , blasi & colafrancesco 1999 , sarazin 2004 , pfrommer & enlin 2004 , brunetti 2009 , brunetti & lazarian 2011 , enlin et al .",
    "nowadays there is agreement on the fact that the abundance of secondaries required to fit the spectrum of ( at least some ) radio halos should produce @xmath0ray emission detectable with the sensitivity of the fermi - lat , assuming low / medium level of cluster magnetic field ( eg .",
    "marchegiani et al 2007 , pfrommer 2008 , brunetti 2009 , jeltema & profumo 2011 ) .",
    "thus the combination of the available information on the spectrum and morphology of radio halos in conjunction with the limits on their @xmath0-ray emission provides a powerful tool to gain insights into the origin of the halo emission .    following this pathway , in this paper we concentrate on the case of the coma cluster , which represents a prototypical example of giant radio halos , with a wealth of data available on its spectrum and morphology .",
    "the incoming upper limits on the coma @xmath0-ray emission with the fermi - lat telescope are invaluable in imposing stringent limits on the amount of cosmic rays that can be stored in the intracluster medium and serve as sources of secondary electrons and positrons . in particular in this paper we combine for the first time all available information about the spectral shape and morphology of the radio halo of the coma cluster with the recent @xmath0-ray upper limits and magnetic field strengths derived from faraday rotation measures .",
    "we show that the requirement of reproducing the properties of the coma radio halo in the context of a pure secondary electron model leads to a large cr energetics and fluxes of @xmath0-rays which results in a tension with the existing upper limits from the fermi - lat ( ackermann et al .",
    "this situation is readily alleviated in the case of a large cluster magnetic field , however the magnetic fields required by the model are appreciably larger than those inferred from recent faraday rotation measures .",
    "this tension disappears when including the effect of turbulent reacceleration in combination with the process of injection of secondary particles .",
    "we adopt a physically motivated picture in which secondary products of cosmic ray interactions are reaccelerated by mhd turbulence during clusters mergers .",
    "in this sense we value the physical insight behind the concept of cosmic ray confinement and the production of secondary electrons , but we do not assume that these particles are `` directly '' responsible for the formation of the radio halo .",
    "we find that even reacceleration models of this type require a broad spatial distribution of the parent cosmic rays , but the expected @xmath0-ray fluxes are well consistent with the fermi - lat upper limits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we discuss the hadronic model of radio emission in  [ sec : hadro ] and the reacceleration model in  [ sec : reacc ] .",
    "a critical discussion of our results is provided in  [ sec : disc ] . a @xmath3cdm cosmology ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) is adopted throughout the paper .",
    "the decay chain responsible for the injection of secondary particles in the icm due to p - p collisions is ( e.g. , blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ) :    @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9    the initial inelastic scattering reaction occurs at threshold , namely it requires protons with kinetic energy larger than @xmath10 mev .",
    "the injection rate of pions is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number density of thermal ( target ) protons , @xmath13 is the spectrum of cosmic ray protons , and @xmath14 is the spectrum of pions from the collision between a cr proton of energy @xmath15 and thermal protons ( taken from brunetti & blasi 2005 )",

    "charged pions decay into muons and then secondary pairs ( electrons and positrons ) . if secondaries are not accelerated by other mechanisms and the physical conditions in the icm do not change on time - scales shorter than the electrons radiative time , their spectrum approaches a stationary distribution because of the competition between injection and energy losses ( e.g. , dolag & ensslin 2000 ) , and one can write :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the injection rate of secondaries ( blasi & colafrancesco 1999 ; moskalenko & strong 1998 ) , and radiative losses , which are dominant for @xmath24 electrons in the icm , can be written as ( sarazin 1999 ) :    @xmath25 \\ , .",

    "the synchrotron spectrum from secondary e@xmath30 is ( rybicky & lightman 1979 ) :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a constant , @xmath33 is the ratio of the energy densities of cr protons to thermal protons , @xmath34 is the synchrotron kernel , @xmath35 is the critical frequency , and @xmath36 is the synchrotron spectral index , where @xmath37 ( in the conditions of interest for our paper ) is due to the log - scaling of the cross  section .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0-rays produced by secondary particles is dominated by the decay of the secondary @xmath38 ( dermer 1986ab ; blasi & colafrancesco 1999 , blasi 2001 ) :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 . under the same assumptions as eq.[jsyn ] ,",

    "this gives a minimum estimate of the cluster @xmath0ray emission since ic and non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission from secondary and primary electrons provide additional contributions ( e.g. sarazin 1999 , blasi 2001 , miniati 2003 ) .",
    "the ratio of the synchrotron and @xmath0ray cluster luminosities depends on the magnetic field in the emitting volume ( from eqs .",
    "[ jsyn ] and [ jgamma ] ) . by considering reasonable assumptions on the magnetic field in galaxy clusters",
    "several authors suggested that observations by the fermi - lat may have the chance to detect @xmath0-rays from nearby clusters hosting radio halos ( pfrommer & enlin 2004 , marchegiani et al .",

    "2008 , brunetti 2009 ) .",
    "more recently , jeltema & profumo ( 2011 ) analysed the impact of limits on the @xmath0-ray emission from clusters of galaxies ( ackermann et al .",
    "2010 ) on hadronic models for the origin of cluster radio halos , deriving lower limits on the average cluster magnetic field . in some cases of nearby radio halos",
    "they find that these lower limits are close to ( or larger than ) the magnetic field values inferred from faraday rotation measures , thereby placing tension on the hadronic origin of radio halos .",
    "in their analysis jeltema & profumo used the total radio luminosity and the @xmath0-ray upper limits .    here",
    "we discuss the possibility that even more stringent limits may be obtained by using the information about the morphology of the radio emission _ in addition _ to the total luminosity .",
    "giant radio halos have flat brightness distributions , in several cases flatter than the thermal x - ray emission of the hosting clusters ( e.g. govoni et al .",
    "2001 , feretti et al .",
    "2001 , brown & rudnick 2011 ) , implying that most of the synchrotron emission is produced in the external regions where the magnetic field is smaller .",
    "thus , we anticipate a larger energy budget of cr protons compared with that needed to explain only the total luminosity of radio halos ( brunetti 2004 , donnert et al .",
    "2010a , b ) .",

    "we summarize our assumptions as follows :    * the spectrum of cosmic ray protons is assumed to be a power law in momentum , as results from most acceleration mechanisms , @xmath45 ; * the spatial distribution of the gas in the icm is taken to follow the _ observed _ @xmath46model that is parameterised according to thermal density at the cluster center , @xmath47 , the core radius , @xmath48 kpc , and @xmath46 ; * the spatial distribution of the energy density of cr protons in the cluster volume is parametrized as @xmath49 ; * the magnetic field strength is assumed to scale with location @xmath50 in the icm according with @xmath51^{\\eta}$ ] , @xmath52 implies that the magnetic field energy density scales with the thermal one .    within these assumptions the synchrotron emissivity from secondary particles ( from eq .",
    "[ jsyn ] ) is :    @xmath53    which implies a synchrotron brightness ( assuming @xmath54 constant on @xmath55 mpc scale to derive simple scalings ) @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the projected distance in units of the core radius , @xmath58 is a constant ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the case @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .    for a given model of magnetic field distribution , @xmath64 , the three key parameters characterizing the radio emissivity and then the predictions for the @xmath0-ray emission are thus :    * @xmath65 : the logaritmic slope of the momentum distribution of cr protons , determined from measurements of the radio spectral index @xmath66 . typically @xmath67 ( for some halos with ultra - steep spectrum @xmath68 ) ; * @xmath69 : the non - linear scaling of the energy density of cr protons with the thermal icm energy density , derived from the shape of the synchrotron brightness profile of the radio halo ; * @xmath70 : the normalization of the momentum distribution of cr protons , determined from the radio luminosity of the halo .",
    "the outcome of this procedure is the expected @xmath0-ray emission from @xmath38decays .",
    "the radio halo in the coma cluster ( coma c ) is the prototypical cluster radio halo ( e.g. , willson 1970 , giovannini et al .",
    "it is unique in that its spectrum is measured over a wide frequency range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hadrocoma ] , left panel ) .",
    "the spectrum shows a significant steepening at high frequencies : a power - law that fits the data at lower frequencies overestimates the flux measured at 2.7 and 5 ghz by a factor 2 and 4 respectively ( schlickeiser et al .",

    "the electron spectrum extends in principle to very high energies , therefore no intrinsic cutoff is expected in the radio spectrum .",

    "the question of whether faraday rm and synchrotron emission measure the same magnetic field only lies in the capability of rm studies to provide a good description of the icm magnetic field .",
    "future radio telescopes , including lofar and ska , will greatly improve the sensitivity to rms allowing to detect and use many tens of background radio sources per clusters to sample magnetic fields along many lines of sight , thus removing potential biases in present studies .",
    "finally , for the sake of completeness we mention that in principle , spatial diffusion of particles in inhomogeneous fields may also affect the value of the ratio synchrotron/@xmath0-ray luminosity in hadronic models , if the diffusion time necessary to cover the spatial scales on which field inhomogeneities occur is smaller than both the life - time of particles and the time - scale of magnetic field ( local ) variations .",
    "this however depends on the details of the magnetic field and diffusion model .      in  [ sec :",
    "reacc ] we went beyond the pure hadronic model and discussed the case of the reacceleration model were secondary particles are reaccelerated by mhd turbulence .",
    "we find that this model allows to obtain a good description of the radio spectrum and morphology of the coma cluster and at the same time they may easily be compatible with the fermi - lat upper limits on the @xmath0-ray emission from this cluster and with the measured magnetic field strength as inferred from rms .    in the simplified assumption that both the ratios of turbulent and thermal energy density , @xmath152 , and of magnetic field and thermal energy density , @xmath196 , are constant in the radio emitting volume , the brightness profile of the coma halo leads us to infer that the spatial distribution of crs in the cluster should be very broad , flat ( or slightly increasing in the external regions ) on the halo size - scale .",
    "this is because the particular reacceleration model adopted in this paper faces drawbacks that are in part similar to those of a pure hadronic model for the origin of the halo .",
    "this is simply because the seed electrons for reacceleration are generated by proton - proton collisions in the icm .",
    "a flat spatial distribution of crs is a fairly strong requirement , although possible support for a rather flat distribution of crs , significantly broader than that of the thermal icm , comes from very recent numerical cosmological simulations that include crs accelerated at shocks ( vazza et al .",
    "present radio data do not constrain the energy density of cr protons on scales larger than the halo size - scale . however if we speculate that the flat spatial distribution of cr protons extends on larger scales the resulting energy budget of crs in the cluster would be significantly larger than that required by our modeling .    in general",
    "several , effects may contribute to mitigate this situation .",
    "first , numerical simulations show that the turbulent energy density ( and the ratio @xmath152 ) increases outside the cores of simulated clusters ( vazza et al .",
    "2009 , 11 ; iapichino & niemeyer 2008 , iapichino et al .",
    "2011 ) , implying a synchrotron brightness profile potentially flatter than that calculated under the assumption of a constant ratio @xmath152 .",
    "second , we limit our analysis to the case @xmath197 ( @xmath73 ) , that gives the best fit to faraday rm . on the other hand for smaller values of @xmath106 the spatial distribution of cr protons that is required by the model to match",
    "the observed synchrotron brightness profile of the halo is significantly steeper with radius , although still flatter than the distribution of the thermal energy density of the cluster .",
    "finally we note that the situation is greatly mitigated as soon as one would relax the assumption of having only secondary electrons in the icm .",
    "indeed primary electrons accelerated at shocks , or during the activity of cluster galaxies and agn , can survive a substantial fraction of the hubble time in the cluster outskirts ( e.g. sarazin 1999 ) .",
    "these primaries provide a natural population of seed electrons to reaccelerate in a turbulent icm ( brunetti et al 2001 , petrosian 2001 ) and may significantly contribute to the synchroton emission in the external regions of giant radio halos .",
    "if a substantial contribution to the radio halo emission comes from the reacceleration of primary electrons , the expected @xmath0ray emission from the coma cluster becomes even smaller than that calculated in ",
    "[ sec : reacc ] .",
    "ongoing and future observations in the deep non - thermal ( high and very - high energy ) regime of the coma cluster will therefore provide precious information on its non - thermal content .",
