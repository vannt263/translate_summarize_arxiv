    "x - ray emission from early type stars has many origins and much progress has been made , particularly in recent years , to understand some of the underlying mechanisms . since the discovery with the _ einstein observatory _  @xcite it has been established that o - stars and most early - type b - stars emit x - rays of some form  @xcite .",
    "observations with _ rosat",
    "_ established a fairly tight relationship between the x - ray and bolometric luminosity with @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "ob - stars that follow this relation are thought to generate x - rays from a distribution of shocks in a line driven wind@xcite .",
    "we have a relatively fair understanding how the shocks lead to x - ray emission and for involved wind velocities one can derive x - ray emissivities from plasma temperatures of up to 25 mk . however ,",
    "once it comes to processes that lead to these shocks , models differ quite substantially  @xcite .    soon after the launch of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ it became clear that the origins of x - rays in hot stars is much more complex and puzzling .",
    "some early observations confirmed the picture where x - rays arise from shock fragments embedded within about 10 stellar radii of the stellar wind  @xcite , but others showed unusually high plasma temperatures and x - ray line properties which seemed to be more related to forms of magnetic activity  @xcite .",
    "hard x - rays from hot stars have now been observed from various circumstellar environments .",
    "enhanced x - ray emission from magnetically confined winds has been observed in young ob - stars in and near the orion trapezium  @xcite and also seems the likely process for @xmath6 sco  @xcite .",
    "candidates for x - ray enhancement through magnetic fields or colliding winds may be located in other young embedded clusters  @xcite .",
    "hard x - rays from colliding wind binaries have been observed in several exotic o - star binaries  @xcite .",
    "binary interactions can also lead to powerful hard x - ray outbursts when two magnetically active stars interact as has been recently proposed for the massive spectroscopic binary in @xmath7 ori a  @xcite .",
    "a third category has recently been identified as a possible source of intrinsic hard x - rays : hot emission line stars .",
    "the prototype of such a source is @xmath4 cas , which before _",
    "chandra _ was known as a hard x - ray source but was considered likely to be a binary system of a b0.5e star orbited by a degenerate companion , probably a white dwarf  @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently reported on high resolution spectra obtained with _",
    "chandra _ which indicated quite a number of peculiar x - ray properties .",
    "the spectra featured various emission line spectral components from hot collisional plasmas which range from 100 ev to 12 kev as well as cold fluorescence . in their analysis",
    "@xcite conclude that the x - ray emission is likely to originate close to the be star and its disk .",
    "in this paper we report on x - ray observations of another early - type star with bright , hot x - ray emission , the o9e emission line star hd  119682 , located in the open cluster ngc  5281 .",
    "the open cluster itself is fairly well - studied .",
    "photometry and proper motion of ngc  5281 were investigated by @xcite , who found an age for the cluster of 45@xmath810  myr and a distance of 1580@xmath8150  pc from fits to the color - magnitude diagram after statistical field star subtraction .",
    "they find a membership probability @xmath9 for hd  119682  based on the proper motion .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically determined the fundamental parameters for hd  119682 , an effective temperature of @xmath10  k , an age of @xmath11  myr , and a luminosity @xmath12 implying a distance modulus consistent with ngc 5281 . given updated determinations of o star effective temperatures which account for line - blanketing @xcite , this effective temperature categorizes hd  119682  as an o9.7 star , but it is certainly on the borderline between o and b , with @xcite recently interpreting their measurements as a b0ve star . the optical spectra from  @xcite do not show any evidence for binarity .",
    "the unequivocal identification of the x - ray source 1wga  j1346.5@xmath06255@xcite with hd  119682  had previously been thwarted by the lack of sufficient spatial resolution in the x - ray band to eliminate source confusion in the center of ngc  5281 as well as the proximity on the sky of a young supernova remnant ( snr ) g309.2@xmath00.6  for which 1wga  j1346.5@xmath06255  could potentially have been a pulsar - wind - nebula ( pwn ) .",

    "the region itself is rather complex .",
    "the line of sight hosts an extended radio structure  @xcite at a distance of about 5 kpc which appears positionally coincident with a second possibly extended x - ray source from the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rass )  @xcite 1rxs j134651.1 - 624843 .",

    "however , its high x - ray brightness as well as a measured spectral index from the _ asca _ observation were equally consistent with a pulsar or synchrotron nebula interpretation @xcite .",

    "both the optical and x - ray properties of hd  119682  are reminiscent of @xmath4 cas where a recent x - ray gratings study concluded that the be - star itself is the likely source of x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "first , hd  119682  has been classified as a very late o or very early b emission line star , similar in type to @xmath4 cas ( b0.5e ) .",
    "second , the likeness between the x - ray properties of hd  119682  and @xmath4 cas is striking .",
    "our spectral analysis produced a two component fit that features a 1 kev soft component and a dominant hard component of about 10 kev .",
    "significant and line emission highlights the hot thermal origin of the spectrum in hd  119682 . likewise @xmath4 cas exhibits a very hot emission component up to @xmath43  kev along with some levels of soft emission . in both stars",
    "the hard emission dominates , with the soft component contributing only 5% of the flux in hd  119682  and 14% in @xmath4  cas  @xcite , which to our knowledge is unique in stellar systems .",
    "furthermore , the measured luminosities are quite similar , @xmath44 , @xmath45 for hd  119682  compared to @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath45 for @xmath4 cas using @xmath47 from @xcite . that the emission from hd  119682  is analogous to @xmath4  cas , seems by far the most likely possibility .    by contrast",
    ", the colliding wind scenario would have to involve another similarly massive companion with extremely strong winds , no evidence for which is seen optically in imaging or spectroscopy . furthermore the spectral type of hd  119682  is o9.7e or later . for such late type stars",
    "the energetics for colliding winds as the origin of the hard x - ray emission are even more difficult to justify .",
    "a recent study by  @xcite involving the massive triple @xmath7 ori a , which contains an o - star of about similar type , showed that even for the existence a close massive companion , the wind densities as well as the involved kinetics do not favor a colliding wind scenario .",
    "hd  119682  should be even less favorable as optical spectra do not indicate a massive companion .",
    "the possibility that the origin of the high - energy emission from hd  119682  is a magnetically confined wind seems a viable alternative .",
    "however , conditions that lead to a confinement scenario , as modeled for the case of @xmath48 ori c  @xcite , seem a bit unrealistic here given the extremely high plasma temperatures of hd  119682 .",
    "furthermore most magnetic activity of such kind has been observed in much younger ob stars  @xcite .",
    "quite recently it was concluded that the field in young @xmath6 sco , another young early type star that shows hard x - ray emission @xcite , is likely of fossil origin rather than some intrinsic dynamo activity  @xcite .",
    "the answer thus has to be more complex .",
    "the remaining possibility points to the quite enigmatic case of @xmath4 cas . for the moment , though , with only a ccd - resolution spectrum we can not go much beyond a discussion about the similarities between @xmath4 cas and hd  119682 .",
    "however , the case may bear implications with respect to the nature of the x - rays in both sources .",
    "hd  119682  is quite well identified and neither optical spectra  @xcite nor our high spatial resolution optical imaging yet show any evidence for a companion .",
    "even though the high resolution spectra of @xmath4 cas provided additional evidence that the observed x - ray emission is likely not due to a possible white dwarf companion , that hypothesis could not be entirely ruled out because of some resemblance between the x - ray emission from some cataclysmic variables and the hetg spectra presented by  @xcite more recently  @xcite reported on another be - star ( b1e ) , hd 110432 ( bz crucis ) , which shares similarly peculiar x - ray and optical characteristics with @xmath4 cas .",
    "the case of hd  119682thus seems to be another candidate of `` @xmath4 cas analogs '' with the strong notion that the hard x - ray emission emanates from a single ob emission line star ."
