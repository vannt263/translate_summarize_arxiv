    "a quantitative theory of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid - saturated porous solid was formulated in the classic papers by biot [ 1 ] .",
    "one of the major findings of biot s work was that there was a breakdown in poisseuille flow above a certain characteristic frequency    specific to the fluid - saturated porous material .",
    "biot theoretically studied this phenomenon by considering the flow of a viscous fluid in a tube with longitudinally oscillating walls under an oscillatory pressure gradient .",
    "apart from the fundamental interest , the investigation of the dynamics of fluid in porous media under oscillatory pressure gradient and oscillating pore walls is of prime importance for the recently emerged technology of acoustic stimulation of oil reservoirs [ 2 ] .",
    "for example , it is known that the natural pressure in an oil reservoir generally yields no more than approximately 10 percent oil recovery .",
    "the residual oil is difficult to produce due to its naturally low mobility , and the enhanced oil recovery operations are used to increase production .",
    "it has been experimentally proven that there is a substantial increase in the net fluid flow through porous space if the latter is treated with elastic waves .",
    "however , there is a fundamental lack of understanding of the physical mechanisms of fluid mobilization in saturated rock through the effect of elastic waves ; the theory of such mobilization virtually does not exist .",
    "biot s theory can be used to describe the interaction of fluid - saturated    solid with the sound for a classic newtonian fluid ; however , oil and other hydrocarbons exhibit significant non - newtonian behavior [ 3 ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to incorporate non - newtonian effects into the classical study of biot [ 1 ] .",
    "recently , del rio , lopez de haro , whitaker [ 4 ] presented a study of enhancement in the dynamic response of a viscoelastic ( maxwell ) fluid flowing in a stationary ( non - oscillating ) tube under the effect of an oscillatory pressure gradient .",
    "we combine this theory with the effect of the acoustic oscillations of the walls of a tube introduced by biot [ 1 ] , providing a complete description of the interaction of maxwell fluid , filling the pores , with acoustic waves .    finally , in order to emphasize that the consept of dynamic permeability is an adequate way of desciprtion of the phenomenon , we note that this concept has been widely used before [ 5 ] .    in the next section",
    "we formulate our model , whereas the last section will conclude with the discussion of the results .",
    "in this section we present our model of maxwell fluid flowing in a cylindrical tube whose walls are oscillating longitudinally and the fluid is subject to an oscillatory pressure gradient .",
    "we give analitical solutions of the problem in the frequency domain .",
    "the governing equations of the problem consist of the continuity equation for the incompressible fluid , @xmath2 and the linearized momentum equation , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 denote velocity , pressure and mass density of the fluid , whereas @xmath7 represents the viscous stress tensor .",
    "we describe the viscoelatic effects of the fluid using maxwell s model , which assumes that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the viscosity coefficient and @xmath10 is the relaxation time .",
    "now , let @xmath11 be a velocity of the wall of the tube which oscillates in time as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the angular frequency .",
    "the flow of fluid in a cylindrical tube with longitudinally oscillating walls can be descibed by a single component of the velocity , namely , its @xmath14-component @xmath15 ( @xmath14 axis is along the ceterline of the tube ) .",
    "we use the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath16 in the treatment of the problem .",
    "we introduce the relative velocty @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "thus , assuming that all physical quantities vary in time as    @xmath12 , we arrive at the following master equation for @xmath17    @xmath19 here , we have introduced the following notations : @xmath20 which is a sum of the applied pressure gradient and force exerted on the fluid from the oscillating wall of the tube and @xmath21 , which is @xmath22 . note that a no - slip boundary condition at the wall is assumed .",
    "the solution of eq.(4 ) can be found to be [ 1 ] @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the bessel function and @xmath25 .    applying a no - slip boundary condition @xmath26 at the wall of the tube , where @xmath27 is its radius ,",
    "we finally get @xmath28= -{{xa^2(1 - i \\omega t_m)}\\over { \\nu } } { { 1}\\over{(\\beta a)^2 } } \\left[1 - { { j_0(\\beta r)}\\over{j_0(\\beta a ) } } \\right ] . \\eqno(5)\\ ] ]    defining the cross - section averaged velocity as @xmath29 we obtain @xmath30 \\equiv k(\\omega ) x. \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is the dynamic permeability [ 4 ] that describes the frequency dependent response of the tube to the applied total force on the fluid .",
    "simple comparison reveals that eq.(6 ) resembles closely eq.(6 ) from ref . [ 4 ] , with the only difference being that we have @xmath32 in place of their @xmath33 . note that in the case of stationary tube walls ( @xmath34 ) eq.(6 ) exactly coincides with eq.(6 ) from ref.[4 ] .",
    "simple calculation ( applying lhospital rule for the @xmath35 uncertanty ) shows that @xmath36 .",
    "thus , following ref.[4 ] , we will introduce the dimensionless dynamic permeability as @xmath37 , which will be used later ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "note , that we were able to easily reproduce fig . 1 from ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , confirming the existence of sharp resonances of @xmath38 in the elastic regime ( see below for the definition of this regime ) .    following the work of biot [ 1 ] we calculate the stress at the wall @xmath39 , @xmath40 note , that when @xmath41 this expression obviously coincides with the corresponding newtonian form .",
    "the total friction force is @xmath42 .",
    "following biot we calculate the ratio of total friction force to the average velocity , i.e. @xmath43 } \\over{(1 -i \\omega t_m ) } } \\left[1 - { { 2 j_1(\\beta a)}\\over { ( \\beta a ) j_0(\\beta a ) } } \\right]^{-1}. \\eqno(8)\\ ] ] simple analysis reveals that @xmath44 which corresponds to the limiting case of poiseuille flow .",
    "following biot [ 1 ] , we also introduce a function @xmath0 with @xmath1 being @xmath45 in the following manner @xmath46 thus , @xmath47 } \\over{(1 -i \\kappa^2 / \\alpha ) } } \\left[1 - { { 2 j_1(\\kappa \\sqrt { i + \\kappa^2 / \\alpha})}\\over { \\kappa \\sqrt { i + \\kappa^2 / \\alpha } j_0(\\kappa \\sqrt { i + \\kappa^2 / \\alpha } ) } } \\right]^{-1}. \\eqno(9)\\ ] ] note , that @xmath0 measures the deviation from poiseuille flow friction as a function of frequency parameter @xmath1 , as introduced by biot [ 1 ] .    in eq.(9 )",
    ", @xmath48 denotes the deborah number [ 4 ] , which is defined as the ratio of characteristic time of viscous effects @xmath49 to the relaxation time @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath50 .    as noted in ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , the value of the parameter @xmath48 determines in which regime the system resides . beyond a certain critical value ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "the system is dissipative , and viscous effects dominate . on the other hand , for small @xmath48 ( @xmath52 ) the system exhibits viscoelastic behavoir which we call the elastic regime .",
    "note , that the newtonian flow regime can be easily recovered from eq.(9 ) by putting @xmath53 .",
    "we plot this limiting case in fig .",
    "as it can be seen from the figure , both @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] exactly coincide with the newtonian limiting case studied in biot s work ( see fig . 4 in ref.[1 ] ) .",
    "this graph demonstrates a breakdown in poiseuille flow as frequency increases ( recall that @xmath56 ) .",
    "in all our calculations we have used polynomial expansions of @xmath24 and @xmath57 with absolute error not exceeding @xmath58 % .",
    "thus , our calculation results are accurate to this order .",
    "a finite - but - large @xmath48 regime is shown in the next two figures .",
    "2 corresponds to the case when @xmath59 .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "2 that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath0 start to deviate from the newtonian fluid behavior at _ large _ frequencies . in fig .",
    "3 solutions correspond to the case when @xmath60 ; thus we see how viscoelastic effects become pronounced already at _ low _ frequencies .",
    "4 presents the behavior of @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] when @xmath61 .",
    "as it can be seen from the graph , sharp resonances appear on the curves .",
    "this feature can be explained by the fact that in this case @xmath48 is less than @xmath62 , which means that the system switched from the dissipative ( viscous ) regime to the elastic one .",
    "5 shows the solutions when @xmath63 . in this case",
    "we see more irregular behavior of @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] with a number of irregular spikes .    the extreme non - newtonian ( elastic ) regime is studied in fig .",
    "6 where we plot the solutions for the case when @xmath64 . in this case",
    "notable change is that there are fewer but more pronounced spikes .",
    "$ ] is close to zero for most of the frequencies , and only at certain frequencies we see sharp resonances . in this regime",
    "the system acts a _ window _ for these frequencies .",
    "another noteworthy observation is that , on one hand , as long as @xmath65 ( figs . 2 and 3 ) , @xmath54 $ ] is always greater than its initial value , i.e. @xmath54 > 1 $ ] , and for large frequencies it reaches a ceratin asymptotic value . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath52 ( figs . 4 - 6 ) , we observe an overall decrease in @xmath54 $ ] with the increase in frequency , i.e. , @xmath54 < 1 $ ] for all @xmath1 s .    in fig .",
    "7 we have also studied the behavior of the dimensionless dynamic permeability @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 , the dimensionless frequency defined as @xmath68 , for the case when @xmath69 . since @xmath52 ,",
    "we observe sharp resonances in the dynamic permability at certain frequences , which can be explained by the non - newtonian behavior of the fluid .",
    "in this paper we have studied non - newtonian effects on the dynamics of fluids in porous media by calculating a flow of maxwell fluid in a tube , which oscillates longitudinally and is subject to an oscillatory pressure gradient .",
    "the present study investigates novelties brought about into the classic biot s theory [ 1 ] of propagation of elastic waves in a fluid - saturated porous solid by inclusion of non - newtonian effects .",
    "we have used time fourier transform and converted the problem to the frequency domain .",
    "we have calculated the dynamic permeability , thus modifying the work of del rio , lopez de haro , whitaker [ 4 ] by inclusion of the effect of longitunally oscillating tube walls .",
    "we investigated how the function @xmath0 , which measures the deviation from poiseuille flow friction as a function of frequency parameter @xmath1 , is modified by non - newtonian effects .",
    "our work thus provides a combined theory of non - newtonian flow in a longitudinally oscillating tube , which constitutes the basis for a realistic model of the effects of elastic waves in a fluid - saturated porous space .",
    "the present analisys clearly demonstrates the existence of a transition from a dissipative to elastic regime ( as @xmath48 decreases ) , in which sharp enhancements of flow ( resonances ) occur .",
    "\\(a ) we studied modifications brought about by non - newtonian effects into biot s theory .",
    "the investigation of the function @xmath0 is important for a number of applications , since @xmath0 uniquely determines the response of a realistic fluid - saturated porous medium to the elastic waves .",
    "thus , determination of @xmath0 for non - newtonian ( maxwell ) fluid is necessary to guide e.g. , oil - field exploration applications .",
    "\\(b ) as we have seen from fig . 7 , non - newtonian effects cause substantial enhancements in dynamic permeability .",
    "we were not able to determine in the literature what value of @xmath48 a natural crude oil would have .",
    "however , as it can be seen from fig.7 for @xmath70 , we can get up to 60 times increase in permeability at certain resonant frequences .",
    "lower @xmath48 s yield even more drastic emhancements . at any rate , we obtained an analytical expression for @xmath0 ( eq.(9 ) ) , which can provide the behavior of this function for any given @xmath48 .    in the introduction section ,",
    "the practical impact of the possibility of acoustic stimulation of oil reservoirs has been outlined .",
    "this result clearly demonstrates that in the crude oil , that can be modelled as a maxwell fluid , there are certain resonant frequencies at which oil production can be increased significantly if the well is irradiated with elastic waves at these frequencies .",
