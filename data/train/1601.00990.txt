    "the application of normal functions in areas peripheral to hodge theory has emerged as a topic of research over the last decade @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; areas related to physics have accounted for much of this growth .",
    "the goal of this work is to use normal functions to give a ` motivic ' meaning to constants arising in quantum differential equations associated to a certain class of landau - ginzburg models .    in @xcite",
    ", there is a explicit computation of a higher normal function associated with the landau - ginzburg mirror of a rank @xmath0 fano threefold , which turns out to be the value of a feynman integral .",
    "we want to present a similar approach , but instead of a feynman integral , we will express some apry constants ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) in terms of a special values of the associated higher normal functions .",
    "landau - ginzburg models are the natural object for ` mirrors ' of fano manifolds ; more precisely , mirror symmetry relates a fano variety with a dual object , which is a variety equipped with a non - constant complex valued function .",
    "for example , a lg model for @xmath1 is a family of elliptic curves and more generally , the lg model of a fano @xmath2-fold is a family of calabi - yau @xmath3-folds . in general",
    ", mirror symmetry relates symplectic properties of a fano variety with algebraic ones of the mirror and vice versa .    in this work",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the landau - ginzburg models for a special class of threefolds , namely the ones whose associated local system is of rank three , with a single nontrivial involution exchanging two maximally unipotent monodromy points .",
    "looking at the classification in @xcite , one finds the short list @xmath4 and `` @xmath5 '' , where the first three are rank @xmath6 fanos appearing in @xcite and the latter is a rank @xmath0 threefold with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 the canonical divisor ) .",
    "the involutions for these lg models have essentially been described in @xcite and @xcite . in the presence of an involution , it is possible to move the degeneracy locus of a higher cycle from the fiber over @xmath9 to its involute , a property which we use for the construction of the desired normal function .",
    "let @xmath10 be a toric degeneration of any of the varieties considered above ; then each one of these will have a mirror landau - ginzburg model , which is a family of @xmath11 surfaces in @xmath12 , that can be constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath13 be a minkowski polynomial for @xmath14 , then the family of @xmath11 is : @xmath15 let @xmath16 and @xmath17 the invariant vanishing cycle about @xmath18 .",
    "we define the period of @xmath13 by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the constant term of @xmath21 .",
    "we say that @xmath20 is the period sequence of @xmath13 .",
    "+ consider a polynomial differential operator @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a polynomial in @xmath24 , then @xmath25 is equivalent to a linear recursion relation . in practice , to compute @xmath26 one uses knowledge of the first few terms of the period sequence and linear algebra to guess the recursion relation .",
    "the operator @xmath26 is called a @xmath27 .    the picard - fuchs operator for the threefold @xmath28 is : @xmath29    more generally , one also gets the same linear recursion on the power - series coefficients @xmath30 of solutions of inhomogeneous equations @xmath31 , @xmath32 a polynomial in @xmath33 , for @xmath34 .    given a linear homogeneous recurrence @xmath35 and two solutions @xmath36 with @xmath37 , if there is a @xmath26-function @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that : @xmath40 we say that [ apery_limit_def ] is the apry constant of @xmath35 .    when we have a family of calabi - yau manifolds , a common way to look for apry constants is by considering the picard - fuchs equation .",
    "as described above , the coefficients of the power series expansion of the solutions of this equation satisfy a recurrence and in some cases the apry constant exists , see @xcite for a wide class of examples . beyond this `` classical '' case",
    ", we can also talk about quantum recurrences , which are recurrences arising from solutions of the quantum differential equations satisfied by the quantum periods , which are defined using quantum products , see @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", golyshev uses quantum recurrences of the threefolds @xmath41 to find apry constants ; his method is basically to use a result of beukers [ @xcite , proposition 3.3 ] for the rational cases and apply a different approach for the non - rational ones . in the course of the proof of his results",
    ", he also describes the involution we mentioned above , but only for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the main theorem of this manuscript is :    [ mainth ] let @xmath44 be a fano threefold , in the special class described above .",
    "then there is a higher normal function @xmath45 , arising from a family of motivic cohomology classes on the fibers of the lg model , such that the apry constant is equal to @xmath46 .    as an immediate corollary of this result and borel s theorem",
    ", the apry constant for these cases must be a @xmath47-linear combination of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which provides a uniform conceptual explanation of this feature of the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that throughout this paper , the cycle groups are taken modulo torsion ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "the fact that the symbol @xmath96 is trivial for all facets is not a coincidence ; in fact , this is always the case for three - dimensional minkowski polynomials .",
    "more precisely , we have :    every three - dimensional minkowski polynomial is tempered .    in general ,",
    "it is not true that every laurent polynomial is tempered ; one of the features of minkowski polynomials is that they give rise to a decomposition in terms of rational irreducible subvarieties , a fact that will be strongly used below .",
    "we use the equivalent definition of tempered as presented in remark [ rmk01 ] .    noting that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are independent of @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , let @xmath101 and @xmath102 be the natural inclusions .",

    "now the @xmath114 are clearly defined over @xmath113 ( as the @xmath115 are ) , and so belong to @xmath116    therefore @xmath117 is trivial , and @xmath13 is tempered by remark [ rmk01 ] .    the notion of minkowski polynomial for dimension greater than @xmath77",

    "if we assume the lattice polytopes in the minkowski decompositions of facets have no interior points , then the proof above will extend to dimension @xmath0 , since we would still have rationality of the @xmath107 ( as above ) , and no significant problems appear in the local - global spectral sequence for higher chow groups .",
    "recall that if @xmath118 is a smooth projective variety , then @xmath119    not every member of our family @xmath81 is smooth , but we can still have an element in the motivic cohomology .",
    "such elements can be explicitly represented via higher chow ( double ) complexes , so that we can still use standard formulas for abel - jacobi maps @xcite : @xmath120    the landau - ginzburg models for the threefolds @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , may be defined by ( the zariski closure of ) the families @xmath121 , with @xmath13 given by : @xmath122    [ pic02 ]   and ( bottom ) @xmath123 respectively . taken from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as these families of k3s all have picard rank 19 , their picard - fuchs operators take the form @xmath124 , with @xmath125 relatively prime polynomials .",

    "associated to @xmath44 is a newton polytope @xmath14 , and to the latter we associate a minkowski polynomial @xmath13 . since by the proposition above , @xmath13 is tempered , the family of higher chow cycles lifts to a class @xmath133\\in { ch}^3(\\mathcal{x}^{\\circ},3)$ ] [ @xcite , theorem 3.8 ] , yielding by restriction a family of motivic cohomology classes @xmath134\\in h^3_{\\mathcal{m}}(x_t,\\mathbb{q}(3))$ ] on the landau - ginzburg model .",

    "the involution @xmath149 gives then a correspondence @xmath150 which gives a rational isomorphism between @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "since @xmath153 induces an isomorphism , the vanishing cycle @xmath17 at @xmath18 is sent to a rational multiple of the vanishing cycle @xmath154 at @xmath155 .",

    "@xmath194    @xmath46 is ( up to @xmath195 ) a multiple of @xmath48 .",
