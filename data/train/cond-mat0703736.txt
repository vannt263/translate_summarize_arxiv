    "the biaxial nematic phase is one of the perennially challenging problems of experimental soft matter physics .",
    "although predicted theoretically by freiser in 1970 @xcite it was not until 1980 that the first experimental observation of this phase has been reported @xcite .",
    "the phase was discovered in a lyotropic , ternary mixture of potassium laurate , 1-decanol , and @xmath0 and its stability attributed to shape change of the micellar aggregates as function of temperature and concentration of amphiphilic molecules @xcite .",
    "the search for a thermotropic biaxial nematic has proved highly controversial for more than two decades . a first qualitative report on a stable uniaxial - to - biaxial nematic phase transition has been reported by li _ et .",
    "@xcite in their system of flexible , ring - shaped trimeric liquid crystal .",
    "recently , this phase has also been detected in two classes of thermotropic materials .",
    "it was reported in banana - shaped mesogens @xcite and in liquid crystalline tetrapodes @xcite .",
    "the last class of materials is particularly interesting for it comprises molecules with four mesogenic units connected together through a flexible spacer .",
    "the optimal packing of such tetrapodes in the biaxial nematic phase is achieved for a quasiflat , platelet configuration of the tetrapod s mesogens that are , on the average , tilted in the plane of the platelet .",
    "a challenge for theory is to find molecular factors responsible for absolute stability of the observed biaxial nematic phase .",
    "the presently existing microscopic models @xcite show that the molecular shape- and pair interaction biaxiality are obviously important for the biaxial phase to exist .",
    "however , as numerous experimental reports have demonstrated @xcite , they seem not sufficient to get the absolutely stable biaxial phase . in the present paper",
    "we show that a variable ( fluctuating ) anisotropy of the molecular shape can be an important stabilizing factor for this phase to occur .",
    "indeed , it seems that this factor appears commonly in the micellar- trimeric- and tetrapod systems .",
    "let us mention that the theoretical studies and computer simulations so far have addressed the size and shape of the micelles in lyotropic systems @xcite , but a connection between the shape anisotropy distribution and the stability of the biaxial nematic phase have not yet been explored .",
    "the present paper is arranged as follows .",
    "after introduction of the model in sec .",
    "ii , we explore stability of the biaxial nematic phase on shape fluctuations in sec .",
    "section iv is devoted to a short summary .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian @xmath1 of @xmath2 liquid crystalline molecules with dynamical degrees of freedom @xmath3 also depends on the @xmath4 variables , which parameterize molecular shape .",
    "the partition function is calculated for each allowed configuration of randomly chosen @xmath5 .",
    "then , in analogy to statistics of disordered systems with annealed disorder @xcite , @xmath5 is treated as a set of dynamical variables that adjust to actual equilibrium conditions . under these circumstances",
    "the free energy , @xmath6 , of the system can be approximated by the logarithm of the @xmath5 averaged partition function @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability distribution of the @xmath5 variables . a role played by the distribution @xmath9 on the formation of the biaxial nematic phase",
    "is studied by generalizing a very elegant mean - field model of mulder and ruijgrok @xcite ( mr ) , which employs a connection between the @xmath10 symmetry and the biaxial nematic liquid .",
    "the most important feature of the model is that its partition function can be calculated exactly , which , as we are going to show , allows one for a semi - analytical treatment of the annealed average ( [ z ] ) .",
    "more specifically , in the mr model the internal , dynamical state of each molecule is parameterized by eight degrees of freedom : three components @xmath11 of the angular momentum @xmath12 and five components @xmath13 of the symmetric and traceless quadrupole moment @xmath14 .",
    "these eight variables are next combined to form eight generators @xmath15 of the @xmath10 algebra , establishing equivalence between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the gell - mann matrices : @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the mr hamiltonian is the mean - field ( mf ) version of the heisenberg - type interaction @xcite @xmath21 where the dynamical variables @xmath22 are subject to two @xmath23-independent constrains , represented by casimir invariants of the @xmath10 algebra @xmath24 with @xmath25 ; @xmath2 is the number of molecules and @xmath26 is the thermodynamic average of @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 variables are the eigenvalues of the traceless matrices @xmath22 , or @xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the the quadrupole moment of the @xmath30 molecule at rest ( @xmath31 ) , obtained from @xmath22 by applying an @xmath10 transformation .",
    "hence , if @xmath29 represents _",
    "e.g. _ the quadrupole moment of a mass distribution the intrinsic properties of a given molecule , like the ratios of its principal axes , enter through the casimir invariants @xmath32 , @xmath33 , eqs .",
    "( [ mrrestrictions2],[mrrestrictions3 ] ) .",
    "this remains in full analogy with what we practise for an ordinary quadrupolar tensor , where the @xmath34- and @xmath35-like invariants are used to characterize biaxiality of relevant physical observable @xcite .",
    "more specifically , depending on the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , or their ratio @xmath36 three possibilities can be distinguished : ( a ) for @xmath37 the tensor is isotropic ; ( b ) for @xmath38 the tensor is uniaxial and ( c ) for @xmath39 the tensor is biaxial with maximal biaxiality being obtained for @xmath40 .",
    "the sign of @xmath35 decides about whether the tensor is prolate ( plus sign ) or oblate ( minus sign ) .",
    "respectively , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 refers to rod - like ( disk - like ) and biaxial molecules . by construction",
    "the mr model is @xmath10 invariant with degrees of freedom running over the group manifold and its free energy is given in an analytical form as derived by itzykson and zuber @xcite .",
    "from physical point of view the model matches the standard landau - degennes phase diagram for biaxial nematics @xcite , known to characterize systems with purely dispersion - type of interactions .",
    "it also reproduces the mean - field results for the dispersion model of luckhurst _",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "[ diagrams0 ] , given we take the pair interactions of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the normalized quadrupole tensor @xmath46 defined through the relation : @xmath47 ; @xmath48 is the ratio of biaxial - to - uniaxial polarizability of the molecule .",
    "the relative error for the @xmath49 boundary calculated for both models does not exceed 2% and is even smaller for the nematic order parameter ( _ see _ fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "note however the usefulness of the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "it avoids calculation of integrals over euler angles inherent to the dispersion model , which , in turn , allows for comprehensive studies of flexible quadrupoles .",
    "a generalization of the mr model to systems with variable anisotropy of the molecular shape ( dispersion forces ) is straightforward .",
    "we assume that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are annealed degrees of freedom weighted with the probability @xmath52 .",
    "the mean - field partition function , @xmath53 , and the dimensionless free energy are then given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the dimensionless temperature and where @xmath56 .",
    "according to itzykson and zuber @xcite the integral over @xmath57 in ( [ qq ] ) can be carried out to give @xmath58 where @xmath59 and where @xmath60 the eigenvalues @xmath61 of the traceless matrix @xmath62 , are determined from the minimum of the free energy ( [ f - mf ] ) . in analogy to ( [ mrrestrictions2],[mrrestrictions3 ] )",
    "the invariants @xmath63 and @xmath64 are used to distinguish between ( a ) the isotropic phase ( @xmath65 ) ; ( b ) the uniaxial nematic phase ( @xmath66 ) and ( c ) the biaxial nematic phase ( @xmath67 ) . in addition , @xmath64 is positive for prolate uniaxial phase ( @xmath68 and negative for oblate uniaxial phase ( @xmath69 .",

    "we believe therefore that for a credible choice of @xmath73 the model correctly reproduces generic phase behavior for flexible quadrupoles in the vicinity of the isotropic phase .",
    "clearly , the original mr model is recovered if @xmath73 is given by dirac delta distribution . in what follows",
    "we take @xmath9 to be the gaussian distribution .",

    "the bifurcation temperature , @xmath135 , is always greater than the corresponding bifurcation temperature for the mono - dispersive system with molecules characterized by the average shape parameters @xmath136 .",

    "one can associate @xmath137 with an effective molecular shape anisotropy of the system in the isotropic phase .",
    "the @xmath138 term , contributing to @xmath137 and being of undetermined sign , effectively changes this anisotropy and thus has a profound effect on stability of the biaxial phase . more specifically , as @xmath139 and @xmath140 , for @xmath141 and @xmath138 of opposite sign with @xmath142 the @xmath143 coefficient can effectively be reduced by the shape fluctuations . if , simultaneously , the invariant @xmath144 is also reduced by fluctuations , which as we checked is easily achieved in the parameter space , the range of stability of the biaxial phase in ( @xmath145 ) space gets enhanced as compared to the case without shape fluctuations .",
    "that is , a sufficient condition to observe a constructive role of shape fluctuations in stabilizing the biaxial nematic phase is the simultaneous fulfilment of two inequalities @xmath146 ) stabilize biaxial nematic phase of maximal biaxiality ( @xmath147 ) , without intermediate uniaxial phase .",

    "[ diagrams1]-[diagrams3 ] .",
    "in particular , we found that the class of parameters where the biaxial nematic phase enhances its stability is much more reacher that the condition ( [ inequalities ] ) may suggest .",
    "however , we are unable to find numerical limitations on the model parameters in a compact form , except for some limiting cases . but",
    "even in these limiting cases we recover all observed classes of the phase diagrams .",
    "the simplest case occurs when one of the dispersions , say @xmath148 , vanishes .",
    "this corresponds to the gaussian distribution for @xmath149 and @xmath84 ( @xmath150 ) , and dirac delta distribution for @xmath151 .",

    "the triple points are connected by the line of the first order transition between the isotropic and biaxial phases . moreover , as expected , the transition temperature , @xmath154 , of the isotropic - nematic phase transition increases with increasing value of @xmath155 , fig .",
    "[ tlandau1 ] .",
    "subsequent case to consider is the full gaussian distribution .",

    "before , the transition temperature , @xmath154 , between the isotropic- and nematic phases is higher than that of the mr model and increases with increasing @xmath158 , fig .",

    "f the biaxial phase is practically eliminated being reduced to a line @xmath159 .",
    "it is interesting to follow reduction of stability of the biaxial phase by comparing diagrams b , h , g and f , where changes of @xmath160 from zero to @xmath155 , for fixed @xmath155 , correspond to successive phase diagrams .",
    "numerical estimates of low - temperature part of the phase diagrams have been checked to stay consistent with asymptotic expansion ( @xmath161 ) of the selfconsistent equations @xmath162 for @xmath130 .",
    "we have studied the influence of the variable molecular shape anisotropy on stability of the biaxial nematic phase . to make the analysis as simple as possible we generalized the exact mean field solution obtained by mulder and ruijgrok @xcite for biaxial molecules to the case when the quadrupole tensor is a dynamical variable .",
    "we assumed that at equilibrium , the molecular shape anisotropy can be approximated by the ( annealed ) distribution , @xmath9 , of the molecular parameters @xmath163 . in the mean - field approximation",
    "the natural choice for @xmath9 , consistent with the maximum entropy principle applied in the isotropic phase , is the two - dimensional gaussian distribution .",
    "the nonzero second moments of the gaussian distribution lead to important remodeling of the original mr phase diagram .",
    "we observe that polydispersivity changes the range of stable biaxial phase and that behavior of the system can qualitatively differ from its mono - dispersive counterpart characterized by the average shape parameters @xmath136 .",
    "generally , the transition between the isotropic and the nematic phases occurs at higher temperatures when molecular shape changes are allowed .",
    "the phase diagram is modified , for instance , by showing the quadruple landau point being splitted into two triple points connected by a line of first order transitions between the isotropic and biaxial phases . by comparing diagrams",
    "b , d and e we can conclude that strong correlations between shape fluctuations along main molecular axes ( @xmath164 ) , or fluctuations along two of the three molecular principal axes lead to particularly large region of stable biaxial phase .",
    "importantly , fluctuations about isotropic shape give rise to stable biaxial nematic without intermediate uniaxial phase , while fluctuations about fixed @xmath165 , diagram g , show on the temperature axis two uniaxial phases separated by the biaxial nematic .    in some cases",
    "the biaxial phase can be destabilized in the vicinity of the isotropic phase giving only the uniaxial nematic phases and first - order phase transitions between them ( class f , fig .  [ diagrams3 ] ) .",
    "similar case has recently been observed by bates @xcite in his computer simulation of a generic , flexible v - shaped molecules on a lattice .",
    "the only difference between our predictions and that of @xcite is that we do not observe a biaxial nematic phase at low temperatures , shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) of @xcite .",
    "a reason for that is our neglecting of temperature dependence in the isotropic distribution ( [ pdf ] ) at low temperatures @xcite . clearly , to be consistent with general thermodynamics at @xmath166 the distribution ( [ pdf ] ) should approach dirac delta function about @xmath167 . in our studies",
    "we have disregarded any temperature dependence in ( [ pdf ] ) , being primarily interested in system s behavior close to the isotropic phase .",
    "however , the diagram predicted in @xcite can also be obtained within our model if we replace @xmath168 by @xmath169 in ( [ pdf ] ) .",
    "then the ground state of ( [ f - mf ] ) for @xmath170 would always be the biaxial nematic phase and , consequently , the phase diagrams of the class f , fig .",
    "[ diagrams3 ] , would go into generic diagrams found by bates .",
