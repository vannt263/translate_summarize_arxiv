    "the spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) is commonly accepted to have been generated by the amplification of vacuum fluctuations in light fields during an inflationary epoch of the early universe .",
    "observations of the cmbr @xcite are in agreement with the prediction based on the simplest , single - field inflationary models of a nearly scale invariant , highly gaussian spectrum of adiabatic cosmological perturbations , see i.e.  @xcite for reviews ; the validity of the inflationary framework has withstood the tests of time since its inception in @xmath0 .",
    "our interest in density perturbations , commonly characterized by the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath1 , stems from the fact that one can differentiate between models by considering higher order correlation functions , which will be probed in upcoming experiments @xcite , such as planck @xcite .",
    "the non linearity parameters @xmath2 @xcite , characterizing the three - point correlation function , and @xmath3 @xcite , characterizing the four - point correlation function , are widely used to estimate non - gaussianities ( ng ) .",
    "even though primordial ng , i.e.  a non - zero three - point function , have not yet been observed , analysis of the 5-year wmap data provides strong indications for their presence , @xmath4 at @xmath5cl @xcite or @xmath6 at @xmath5 cl in the re - analysis by k. smith et.al .",
    "the recently launched planck satellite @xcite will be sensitive enough to detect ng in the next years with @xmath7 , if they are indeed present at the currently expected level ; further , bounds on @xmath3 will be considerably improved .",
    "simple single - field models have typically tiny non - gaussianities @xcite . however , more complicated models warrant the possibility of allowing for larger ng within the inflationary framework ; examples are features in the potential @xcite , preheating @xcite , modulated preheating @xcite , the presence of additional light fields , and thus isocurvature perturbations , as in the curvaton - scenario @xcite , trapped fields @xcite , dbi - inflation / k - inflation @xcite , nonlocal inflation @xcite , among others .",
    "alternative proposals , such as the new - ekpyrotic scenario @xcite , have usually quite strong ng signals too @xcite , see @xcite for a review .    in this article",
    ", we further investigate the possibility to generate ng in multi - field inflationary models .",
    "the generation of ng in multi - field models was considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite for hybrid / multi - brid models , and @xcite for related work ) , where it was found that the non - linearity parameters are usually slow roll suppressed .",
    "the presence of isocurvature modes in multi - field models @xcite can cause fourier - modes of the curvature perturbation @xmath8 to evolve even after horizon exit , provided that the trajectory in field space is curved .",
    "hence , ng can be sourced @xcite , but a sharp turn , and thus violation of the slow - roll conditions , is usually required to give rise to large ng . a computation of @xmath2 involving two fields , a separable potential , and the slow - roll approximation was made by vernizzi and wands @xcite , which was later extended to an arbitrary number of fields in @xcite and the tri - spectrum ( @xmath3 ) in @xcite .",
    "however , slow roll can be temporarily violated during inflation , i.e.  if a bump in the potential is encountered , if fields start to decay during inflation as in staggered / cascade inflation @xcite , and it is necessarily violated at the end of inflation and during ( p)re - heating .",
    "unfortunately , almost all analytic studies based on the ( non - linear ) @xmath9-formalism @xcite - formalism @xcite , and needed to deal with higher order correlation functions . ] are based on the slow roll approximation , rendering them unapplicable in these cases ( see however @xcite ) ; other computational techniques that do not involve the slow roll approximation are much more involved and analytic results for higher order correlation functions become unfeasible .",
    "recently , byrnes and tasinato @xcite found a class of inflationary models that are amendable to an analytic computation of ng within the @xmath9-formalism , without imposing the slow - roll or the horizon - crossing approximation , but requiring a separable hubble parameter @xmath10 .",
    "they focused on two - field models with canonical kinetic terms and computed an expression for @xmath2 . in this paper",
    ", we generalize this framework to an arbitrary number of fields and provide expressions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we demonstrate the applicability of the formalism in a concrete toy model with up to six inflaton fields that allows for the generation of large ng towards the end of inflation .",
    "due to the assumption of a separable hubble parameter , the potential necessarily contains cross couplings between the inflatons .",
    "thus , simple models of assisted inflation @xcite do not fall into the class of models amendable to our treatment .",
    "however , the absence of cross couplings does in fact constitute fine tuning , and more realistic models of multi - field inflation in string theory are closer to the ones we consider .",
    "furthermore , the presence of cross couplings should render the framework at hand applicable to an analytic computation of ng during ( p)reheating , a project we plan to come back to in the future .",

    "however , discriminating between @xmath109 and @xmath201 appears to be hopeless in the absence of a compelling reason for choosing one set of initial conditions over the other even if ng are observed .",
    "if one can choose starting points for the fields freely , any level of ng of a two - field case can be mimicked by a model with more fields .",
    "for instance , modest changes of the initial values in fig .",
    "[ pic : ng_multi ] similar to the ones in fig .",
    "[ pic : ng_byrnes_inichanges ] would allow for a tuning of the non - linearity parameters at @xmath192 .",
    "based on the assumption of a separable hubble parameter @xmath202 , we computed analytically non - gaussianities ( ng ) , that is the non - linearity parameters characterizing the bi- and tri - spectrum , in multi - field inflationary models with an arbitrary number of fields and without using the slow roll approximation , the horizon crossing approximation , or a separable potential , extending the work of byrnes and tasinato @xcite .",
    "based on the @xmath9-formalism , we derived analytic expression for @xmath115 , @xmath111 and @xmath164 for @xmath113 , which are easily computed once the background evolution of the fields is known .    to show the applicability of the formalism",
    ", we considered a simple exponential dependence of the hubble parameter on the fields .",
    "this model has the advantage of being analytically solvable at the background level , but it comes at the price of being unrealistic once inflation comes to an end .",
    "if initial conditions are fine tuned , observably large ng can be produced towards the end of inflation , but the general prediction of this class of models are negligible ng .",
    "further , even if ng are produced when @xmath203 , it remains to be seen if they are imprinted onto radiation after inflation , because the sudden increase of the non - linearity parameters appears to be a transient phenomenon .",
    "we note that the formalism should be well suited for a computation of ng during ( p)reheating , because the number of fields is not restricted , the slow roll approximation is not required and cross couplings between the fields are allowed .",
    "indeed , in light of the example studied here , it appears mandatory to follow the non - linearity parameters through the era of inflaton decay , until fluctuations are imprinted onto radiation .",
    "we postpone a study of ng from ( p)reheating to a forthcoming publication .",
