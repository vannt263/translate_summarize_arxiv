    "quantum metrology , also known as quantum parameter estimation , aims at studying the ultimate measurement precision of physical parameters that is limited by the laws of quantum theory  @xcite . in general ,",
    "the quantum precision depends on the properties of the probing quantum states , the interaction of the states with the target , and the strategy of measurement . for quantification , the quantum cramr - rao bound ( qcrb )  @xcite , which sets the lower bound of the estimation uncertainty with any possible measurement strategy ,",
    "is customarily employed . under this circumstance ,",
    "the goal of the studies on quantum parameter estimation is to reduce the qcrb and hence achieve super - sensitivity .",
    "using classical light sources , the qcrb can reach the standard quantum limit ( sql ) of precision with a scaling @xmath0 , in which @xmath1 is the mean photon number of the quantum probe .",
    "on the other hand , by taking advantages of quantum properties such as entanglement and squeezing  @xcite , one can beat the sql and approach the heisenberg limit with a scaling @xmath2 , which has a @xmath3 benefit over the classical counterpart .",
    "extensive theoretical and experimental research work has been conducted for the estimation problem of a single parameter  @xcite . in particular , the noon state  @xcite is customarily considered to show the ability of breaking the sql  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there has been recently increasing interest in the study of multi - parameter estimation in view of the potential advantage of increased estimation efficiency in simultaneous multiple parameter determination . in cases where there are couplings among the different parameters or the underlying generators are non - commutative , it was found that quantum entanglement may not necessarily be advantageous  @xcite .",
    "for the other class of problems where the parameters do not couple to each other , certain entangled states have been studied in order to reach the heisenberg limit .",
    "especially , the latter situation is applicable to optical phase imaging in which the unknown parameters represent the phase shifts at different spatial pixels induced by a phase object . in such context , humphreys _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the multi - parameter estimation using a multi - mode noon state can approach the heisenberg limit with an @xmath4 advantage over the independent estimation of @xmath5 phase shifts using @xmath5 copies of two - mode noon states .",
    "it should be noted that such an advantage is due to the large photon number variance in the single modes of the multi - mode state and can be reproduced using only local strategies  @xcite . aside from the noon state , other quantum probes have also been considered , such as the cat state @xcite , the holland - bernett state  @xcite , entangled coherent state  @xcite , gaussian state  @xcite , etc .",
    "besides the quantum probe , another significant factor determining the ultimate precision in quantum imaging is how the state interacts with the target object , which is usually represented by a unitary operator  @xcite . for the estimation of a single unknown parameter @xmath6",
    ", the interaction operator can be written as @xmath7  @xcite , with @xmath8 linear in the photon number operator .",
    "this linear characterization is more common in experiments  @xcite and hence more often considered than the nonlinear cases with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , even though the latter can potentially reduce the uncertainty with a degree @xmath11 and reach @xmath12  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we presented a class of quantum entangled states for the study of multi - parameter quantum metrology in optical phase imaging .",
    "it is generalized from the multi - mode noon state , where the non - vacuum mode can have arbitrary photon statistics instead of a fixed number of photons ( fock state ) .",
    "we obtained an analytical form of the qcrb using this balanced state , i.e. , the probability amplitude of the reference component is the same as that of the components probing the quantum system .",
    "specifically , we studied the imaging performances when the probe state is a multi - mode noon state , entangled coherent state , entangled squeezed coherent state , and entangled squeezed vacuum state .",
    "comparisons were made among these different probe states and it was proven that , with the same mean number of photons , the entangled squeezed vacuum state has the lowest estimation uncertainty and hence leads to the best imaging precision , followed by squeezed coherent state , entangled coherent state , and noon state .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that for the squeezed coherent state scenario , the higher the squeezing degree is , the lower the uncertainty will be .",
    "in addition , we showed that the balanced entangled state can perform better than its unbalanced counterpart adopted in the previous works  @xcite under the squeezed vacuum scenario .",
    "finally , we described an experimental setup that can produce a two - mode entangled state , which has the ability to beat noon state with respect to the ultimate sensitivity .",
    "parameters . ( b ) discretized phase imaging model.,width=264 ]    in the following , we study the simultaneous estimation problem for @xmath5 independent phases .",
    "the schematic of the setup follows  @xcite and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the quantum probe we choose is a balanced @xmath13-mode entangled pure state , which can be written as @xmath14 it is a superposition of @xmath15 multi - mode quantum states , each of which has arbitrary photon statistics in mode @xmath16 denoted by state @xmath17 and no photons in the other modes .",
    "the normalization coefficient is given by @xmath18 by convention , the @xmath19 mode is chosen as the reference .",
    "note that the state has balanced weights between the reference mode and the other information modes , which will be shown below to perform better than the unbalanced case under certain circumstance .",
    "the total mean photon number for this state is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mean photon number for the single mode state @xmath22 .",
    "it is noticeable that @xmath23 is always true , which is due to a finite probability of state @xmath22 containing no photons .",
    "the equality is satisfied only when @xmath24 as in the case , for example , of a noon state . in practical sensing problems",
    ", @xmath25 may be more meaningful than @xmath26 since it characterizes on average how many photons are used for the simultaneous parameter estimation .    in this paper , we assume that the phase object induces linear phase shifts to the probe .",
    "therefore the unitary operator is denoted as @xmath27 where @xmath28 represents @xmath5 independent phases and @xmath29 is the photon number operator for the mode @xmath16 . in writing eq .",
    "( [ eq_unitary_operator ] ) , we have assumed that the reference mode has a phase set to zero , which practically can be achieved by phase - locking the reference arm with some external reference  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the reference mode is to make the comparison with the multi - mode states considered in the previous works more explicit  @xcite .",
    "the output state after the propagation process then reads as @xmath30 .",
    "given the probe state and the evolution operator , we can now calculate the quantum cramr - rao bound , which is inversely proportional to the quantum fisher information .",
    "then , we get the lower bound of the estimation uncertainty @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath33 quantum fisher information matrix . the condition for the qcrb being saturated is @xmath34  @xcite , where @xmath35 is the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) and @xmath36 denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath37 . since @xmath38 and @xmath39 , it is straightforward to find out that the saturation condition is always true for our scenario .",
    "finally , by calculating the quantum fisher information matrix as  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes @xmath42 with the mode number index @xmath16 in @xmath43 omitted for simplicity , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively represent the @xmath33 identity matrix and the matrix with all elements equal to 1 , we obtain the expression of the quantum cramr - rao lower bound , @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq_qcrb_function ] ) gives the analytical form of the qcrb for any quantum probe with the form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq_generalized_state ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath48 is strictly positive here , for if it were zero , the required condition would be @xmath49 which contradicts the nonnegativity of the variance @xmath50 .",
    "it is remarked , as also mentioned previously , that local strategies can reproduce the performance of the multi - mode quantum states  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mode - separable state for eq .",
    "( [ eq_generalized_state ] ) is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the normalization .",
    "this local mode - separable state can perform similarly to the multi - mode state  ( [ eq_generalized_state ] ) in phase estimation when @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "it has the advantages of being easier to create and more resilient to loss , despite of its large vacuum component that makes it increasing inefficient with a larger @xmath5 .",
    "since the main focus of this paper is to study the properties of the multi - mode noon - like states , the mode - separable forms will not be elaborated in the subsequent discussion .",
    "in this section , we consider four specific scenarios , which are the multi - mode noon state @xmath54 ( @xmath55 )  @xcite , the entangled coherent state ( ecs ) @xmath56 ( @xmath57 )  @xcite , the entangled squeezed vacuum state ( esvs ) @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , and the entangled squeezed coherent state ( escs ) @xmath60 ( @xmath61 )  @xcite .",

    "the mean photon numbers for the balanced multi - mode entangled states above are @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .    for the balanced multi - mode noon state",
    ", its minimum uncertainty takes a simple form : @xmath71 where the number of phases @xmath5 and the photon number @xmath1 are independent parameters .    to compare the qcrb with respect to different quantum probes , we first need to set the different probes under the same footing .",
    "a natural choice is the mean total photon number @xmath25 given by eq .",

    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq_qcrb_function ] ) as a function of a defined factor @xmath72 : @xmath73 it is remarked that @xmath74 is related solely to the expectations with respect to the single mode state @xmath22 , whereas @xmath5 and @xmath25 are the features of the entire multi - mode state @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath5 and @xmath25 are fixed , @xmath48 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath74 , where @xmath76 and the equality for the upper bound holds for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , i.e. , noon state .",
