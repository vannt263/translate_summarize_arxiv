    "in order to search for correlation between various characteristics of the hard x - ray emission from the source the original data were regrouped according to the source intensity in the following way .",
    "the entire range of the 40 - 150 kev flux variations was divided into number of bins of the same width . for each individual dataset",
    "the bin number was determined according to its intensity .",
    "the mean energy and power density spectra corresponding to each intensity bin were calculated by averaging over all individual datasets with intensity falling into the given bin intensity range .    for cyg x-1 16",
    "intensity bins were chosen covering the 1.9 to 6.9 cnt / sec/@xmath10  ( 0.5 - 1.8 crab ) intensity range .",
    "the regrouping procedure was applied to the data of individual si exposures ( 4 - 8 hours long - the highest time resolution providing both spectral and timing information ) each exposure being treated as a separate dataset .    in the case of 1e1740 - 294 , having 5 to 20 times lower signal to noise ratio the data averaged over single observations ( comprised of 1 - 6 si exposures with total duration of 4 - 34 hours ) were treated as individual datasets to be regrouped .",
    "the intensity range 0.3 to 5.6 cnt / sec/@xmath11(80 - 1500 mcrab ) was divided into 10 intensity bins .",
    "in order to quantify the hardness of the spectrum the optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung model was chosen .",
    "although likely having no direct physical relation to the origin of the hard x - ray emission from the source , it provides a good approximation to the observed spectra and quantifies the spectral shape in terms of a single parameter - the best - fit temperature .",
    "the relative error of the observed spectrum approximation by this model is less than 10% in the 40 - 300 kev energy range .",
    "the approach to timing analysis of the sigma data was described in vikhlinin et al .",
    "the dependence of the best - fit bremsstrahlung temperature on the 40 - 200 kev luminosity for both sources is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the similarity in the behaviors of the two sources is apparent .",
    "approximation of the points for cyg x-1 by a broken constant is shown by a dashed line .",
    "surprisingly , the same curve describes very well the data for 1e1740 - 294 .",
    "2 shows a dependence of the best - fit bremsstrahlung temperature upon the @xmath7 of the short - term flux variations for cyg x-1 ( the individual datasets were grouped in the same way as in fig.1 ) .",
    "it should be noted , that shown in fig .",
    "1 and 2 are parameters derived from averaged energy and power density spectra for each intensity bin and the error bars are statistical only .",
    "the analysis of individual datasets , corresponding to the given intensity bin reveals considerable dispersion of the best - fit parameters above the level of statistical fluctuations .",
    "this dispersion is of the order of @xmath1215% of the values of the best - fit temperature shown in fig .",
    "therefore , dependencies , shown in fig . 1 and 2 are not point - to - point correlations , but rather represent some averaged pattern of the behavior of the parameters .",
    "there are two major possibilities to explain observed behavior .",
    "the first one is that softening of the source spectrum corresponds to the beginning of the transition to the soft spectral state known as a common feature of black hole candidates .",
    "it is known also that the @xmath7 of the short - term flux variations is considerably smaller during soft spectral state which explains the pattern in fig .",
    "2 . note , that in this case the decrease of the hard x - ray luminosity does not reflect at all the behavior of the overall x - ray luminosity which is increasing .",
    "the second possibility is that the change of the spectral hardness reflects changes of conditions in the hard x - rays production site having no connection with transition to the soft spectral state . in this case pattern in fig .",
    "2 hints on close relation between the hardness of the emergent spectrum and level of the short - term flux variations ."
