    "since the very beginning of the pioneer work by watts and strogatz @xcite , the interest toward small - world networks - an interplay between random and regular networks - has been growing `` exponentially '' .",
    "mainly , there are two reasons that have caused such a `` diffusion '' .",
    "the first reason is due to the topological properties of the small - world network . in synthesis , if @xmath8 is the size of the system , for any finite probability @xmath9 of rewiring , or for any finite added random connectivity @xmath4 ( the two cases correspond to slightly different procedures for building a small - world network ) one has : a `` short - distance behavior '' , implying that the average shortest distance between two arbitrarily chosen sites grows as @xmath10 , as in random networks , and a large clustering coefficient , @xmath11 , as in regular lattices .",
    "the interplay between these two features makes small - world networks representative of many realistic situations including social networks , communications networks , chemical reactions networks , protein networks , neuronal networks , etc .",
    "the second reason is due the fact that , in models defined over small - world networks , despite the presence of an underlying finite dimensional structure - a lattice @xmath0 of dimension @xmath12 - the existence of short - cut bonds makes such models mean - field like and - hopefully - exactly solvable .",
    "however , even if such a claim sounds intuitively correct , the complexity of these models turns out to be in general quite high and , compared to numerical works , there are still few exact results for small - world networks @xcite-@xcite ( for the percolation and synchronization problem see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in particular , for @xmath13 a mean - field critical behavior",
    "is expected and has been also supported by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "some natural questions then arise .",
    "are we able to prove analytically such a behavior ?",
    "if for example @xmath14 , does the mean - field critical behavior hold for any situation ? yet , does the correlation length diverge at the critical temperature ?    furthermore , even if for @xmath7 an exact analytical treatment has been developed at the level of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) @xcite and one step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) @xcite , the calculations are quite involved and the solutions of the coupled equations to evaluate the order parameters require a certain numerical work , which becomes rapidly hard in the 1rsb case . in any case , even if these methods are able to give in principle exact results at any temperature , they are not in general suitable to provide a clear simple and immediate physical picture of the model , even within some approximations .",
    "the main problem in fact resides in the presence of short loops : as soon as @xmath13 these loops can not be neglected and the `` traditional '' cavity and replica methods seem hardly applicable .",
    "in particular , we are not able to predict what happens , for example , if we set @xmath2 negative .",
    "should we still expect a second - order phase transition ? and what about the phase diagram ?    in this paper , we present a general method to study random ising models defined on small - world graphs built up by adding a random connectivity @xmath4 over an underlying arbitrary lattice @xmath0 having dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that this method - in a very simple and physically sound way - provides an answer to the above questions as well as to many others .    roughly speaking , as an effective field theory",
    "the method generalizes the curie - weiss mean - field equation @xmath15 to take into account the presence of the short - range couplings @xmath2 besides the long - range ones @xmath16 . as we will show , the magnetization @xmath17 of the model defined over the small - world network , shortly the _ random model _",
    ", behaves as the magnetization @xmath18 of the model defined over @xmath0 , shortly the _ unperturbed model _ , but immersed in an effective external field to be determined self - consistently .",
    "even if the exactness of this method is limited to the paramagnetic regions ( p ) , it provides the exact critical behavior and the exact critical surfaces , as well as simple qualitative good estimates of the correlation functions in the ferromagnetic ( f ) and spin glass regions ( sg ) .",
    "furthermore , in unfrustrated systems , the method becomes exact at any temperature in the two limits @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the consequences of such a general result are remarkable from both the theoretical and the practical point of view .",
    "once the explicit form of the magnetization of the unperturbed model , @xmath21 , is known , analytically or numerically , as a function of the couplings @xmath2 and of the external field @xmath22 , we get an approximation to the full solution of the random model , which is analytical or numerical , respectively , and becomes exact in the p region . if we do not have @xmath23 but we know at least some of its properties , we can still use these properties to derive certain exact relations and the critical behavior of the random model .    in the first part of the paper , after presenting the self - consistent equations , we focus on their application for a general study of the critical surfaces and of the critical behavior . in the second part ,",
    "we apply the method to study models of interest which can be solved analytically ( and very easily ) as for them we know @xmath24 : the viana - bray model ( which can be seen as a @xmath6 dimensional small - world model ) , the one - dimensional chain small - world model , and the spherical small - world model in arbitrary @xmath1 dimension .",
    "we stress that the critical surfaces as well as the correlation functions in the p region provided by the present method are exact and not based on any special ansatz as the replica - symmetry and the tree - like ansatz .",
    "we prove in particular that : independently of the added random connectivity @xmath4 , of the underlying dimension @xmath1 , of the structure of the underlying lattice @xmath0 , and of the nature of the phase transition present in the unperturbed model ( if any ) , for @xmath3 we always have a second - order phase transition with the classical mean - field critical indices but with a finite correlation length if calculated along the `` euclidean distance '' defined in @xmath0 ; on the other hand , for @xmath5 we show that , as soon as @xmath4 is sufficiently large , there exist at least two critical temperatures which , depending on the behavior of @xmath25 - the susceptibility of the unperturbed system - correspond to first- or second - order phase transitions .",
    "this phenomenon will be explicitly shown in the example of the one - dimensional small - world model .",
    "note that , as it will result from the detailed analysis of the self - consistent equation ( sec .",
    "iiib ) , in any case , the critical behavior of the unperturbed model - if any - can never influence the behavior of the random model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the class of small - world networks over which we define the random ising models , stressing some important differences concerning the definition of the correlation functions with respect to those usually considered in `` ordinary '' random models . in sec .",

    "the starting point of the proof is given in sec .",
    "vii and is based on a general mapping between a random model and a non random one @xcite-@xcite suitably adapted to the present case .",

    "ix , the derivations of the equations presented in sec .",

    "x we draw some conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we generalize the method to inhomogeneous external fields to make clear the subtle behavior of the correlation functions in small - world models .",
    "the family of models we shall consider are random ising models constructed by super - imposing random graphs with finite average connectivity @xmath4 onto some given lattice @xmath0 whose set of bonds @xmath27 and dimension will be indicated by @xmath28 and @xmath1 , respectively . given an ising model ( _ the unperturbed model _ ) of @xmath8 spins coupled over @xmath0 through a coupling @xmath2 with hamiltonian @xmath29 and given an ensemble @xmath30 of unconstrained random graphs @xmath31 , @xmath32 , whose bonds are determined by the adjacency matrix elements @xmath33 , we define the corresponding small - world model as described by the following hamiltonian @xmath34 the free energy @xmath35 and the averages @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , being defined in the usual ( quenched ) way as ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the partition function of the quenched system @xmath42 @xmath43 the boltzmann - average of the quenched system ( @xmath44 depends on the given realization of the @xmath45 s and of @xmath31 : @xmath46 ; for shortness we later will omit to write these dependencies ) @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two product measures given in terms of two normalized measures @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively : @xmath52 @xmath53    the variables @xmath54 specify whether a `` long - range '' bond between the sites @xmath55 and @xmath56 is present ( @xmath57 ) or absent ( @xmath58 ) , whereas the @xmath59 s are the random variables of the given bond @xmath27 . for the @xmath59 s we will not assume any particular distribution , while , to be specific , for the @xmath60 s we shall consider the following distribution @xmath61 this choice leads in the thermodynamic limit @xmath62 to a number of long range connections per site distributed according to a poisson law with mean @xmath63 ( so that in average there are in total @xmath64 bonds ) .",
    "note however that the main results we report in the next section are easily generalizable to any case in which eq .",
    "( [ pg ] ) holds , or holds only in the thermodynamic limit due a sufficiently small number of constrains among the matrix elements @xmath60 .",

    "( [ dpsg ] ) @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "the quantities of major interest are the averages , and the quadratic averages , of the correlation functions which for shortness will be indicated by @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "for example , the following are non connected correlation functions of order @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and the indices @xmath73 are supposed all different . for shortness we will keep on to use the symbols @xmath68 and @xmath69 also for the connected correlation function since , as we shall see in the next section",
    ", they obey to the same rules of transformations .",
    "we point out that the set of indices @xmath73 is fixed along the process of the two averages .",
    "this implies in particular that , if we consider the spin with index @xmath55 and the spin with index @xmath56 , their distance remains undefined , or more precisely , the only meaningful distance between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , is the distance defined over @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the euclidean distance between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which we will indicate as @xmath74 .    therefore , throughout this paper",
    ", it must be kept in mind that , for example , @xmath75 is very different from the correlation function @xmath76 of two points at a fixed distance @xmath77 , @xmath77 being here the distance defined over both @xmath0 and the random graph @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the minimum number of bonds to join two points among both the bonds of @xmath28 and the bonds of the random graph @xmath31 .",

    "if we now use @xmath76 @xmath81 @xcite ( in the p region holds the equality ) and the fact that the average of @xmath77 with respect to @xmath80 is of the order @xmath82 , we see that the two point connected correlation function ( [ cf1 ] ) goes to 0 in the thermodynamic limit",
    ". similarly , all the connected correlation functions defined in this way are zero in this limit .",
    "note however , that this independence of the variables holds only if @xmath78 .",
    "this discussion will be more deeply analyzed along the proof by using another point of view , based on mapping the random model to a suitable fully connected model .",
    "depending on the temperature t , and on the parameters of the probability distributions , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the random model may stably stay either in the paramagnetic ( p ) , in the ferromagnetic ( f ) , or in the spin - glass ( sg ) phase . in our approach for the f and sg phases",
    "there are two natural order parameters that will be indicated by @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "similarly , for any correlation function , quadratic or not , there are two natural quantities indicated by @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and that in turn will be calculated in terms of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "to avoid confusion , it should be kept in mind that in our approach , for any observable @xmath89 , there are - in principle - always two solutions that we label as f and sg , but , as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "iiid , for any temperature , only one of the two solutions is stable and useful in the thermodynamic limit .    in the following",

    "in this paper we have presented a novel and general method to analytically face random ising models defined over small - world networks . the key point of our method is the fact that , at least in the p region , any such a model can be exactly mapped to a suitable fully connected model , whose resolvability is in general non trivial for @xmath13 , but still as feasible as a non random model . as a main result",
    "we then derive a general self - consistent equation , eq .",
    "( [ theoa ] ) , which allows to describe effectively the model once the magnetization of the unperturbed model in the presence of a uniform external field , @xmath91 , is known .",
    "the physical interpretation of this general result is straightforward . from eqs .",
    "( [ theoa ] ) we see that , concerning the magnetization @xmath85 , the effect of adding long range poisson distributed bonds implies that the system - now perturbed - feels , besides the coupling @xmath2 , also an effective external field @xmath96 shrunk by @xmath85 itself . concerning @xmath86 , the effect is that the system now feels a modified effective coupling @xmath99 and an effective external field @xmath97 shrunk by @xmath86 itself .",
    "we are therefore in the presence of an _ effective field theory _ which , as opposed to a simpler _ mean - field theory _ , describes @xmath85 and @xmath86 in terms of , not only an effective external field , but also through the non trivial function @xmath24 which , in turn , takes into account the correlations due to the non zero short - range coupling @xmath2 or @xmath99 felt by the unperturbed system .",
    "the combination of these two effects gives rise to the typical behavior of models defined over small - world networks : the presence of a non zero effective external field causes the existence of a phase transition also at low @xmath1 dimension .",
    "however , the precise determination of both the critical surface and the correlation functions is obtained in a non trivial way via the unperturbed magnetization @xmath91 .",
    "we have used the method introduced to analyze the critical behavior of generic models with @xmath3 and @xmath5 and showed that they give rise to two strictly different phase transition scenarios . in the first case , we have a mean - field second - order phase transition with a finite correlation length . whereas , in the second case , we obtain multiple first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the combination of the f and sg solutions results in a total of four possible kinds of phase diagrams according to the cases * ( 1 ) * @xmath291 , * ( 2 ) * @xmath292 , * ( 3 ) * @xmath710 , and * ( 4 ) * @xmath711 .",
    "one remarkable difference between systems with @xmath712 and those with @xmath713 , is that in the latter case we have , in principle , also first - order p - sg phase transitions and , moreover , re - entrance phenomena are in principle possible even for @xmath3 .    in secs .",
    "iv , v , and vi we have applied the method to solve analytically those models for which the unperturbed magnetization @xmath91 is known analytically , _",
    "i.e. _ , the small - world models in dimension @xmath714 , corresponding to an ensemble of non interacting units ( spins , dimers , etc ... ) , the one dimensional chain , and the spherical model , respectively . in particular , we have studied in detail the small - world model defined over the one dimensional chain with positive and negative short - range couplings showing explicitly how , in the second case , multicritical points with first- and second - order phase transition arise .",
    "finally , the small - world spherical model - an exact solvable model ( in our approach ) with continuous spin variables - has provided us with an interesting case study to explore what happens as @xmath1 changes continuously from 0 to @xmath715 .",
    "as expected from general grounds , unlike the non random version of the model , the small - world model presents always a finite temperature phase transition , even in the limit @xmath460 .",
    "this latter result - besides to be consistent with what we have found in the @xmath6-dimensional discrete models - has a simple physical explanation in our approach .",
    "in fact , it consists on mapping the small - world model ( a random model ) to a corresponding non random model ( no long - range bonds ) but immersed in an effective uniform external field which is active as soon as the added random connectivity @xmath4 is not zero ( see eqs .",
    "( [ theoa])-([theoc ] ) ) .",
    "many interesting variants of the above models can be considered and are still analytically solvable by our approach ( see also the generalizations considered in sec .",
