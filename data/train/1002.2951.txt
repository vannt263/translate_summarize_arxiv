    "magic ( _ _ m__ajor _ _ a__tmospheric _ _ g__amma - ray _ _ i__maging _ _ c__herenkov ) is currently a system of two 17 m telescopes located atop the roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma at 2200 m a.s.l .",
    "the observations refered to in this study were obtained during the years 2004 - 2009 when magic was still a single - dish telescope .",
    "its 234@xmath2 tessellated parabolic mirror allows observations of vhe ( _ _ v__ery _ _ h__igh _ _ e__nergy ) @xmath3-rays between @xmath150gev and 10tev .    one key goal of the magic telescope project is to determine the properties of extragalactic vhe sources , among which the high - frequency peaked bl lacertae objects are the most numerous .",
    "blazars are a subclass of radio - loud agn and belong to the most extreme and powerful objects in the universe .",
    "they are characterized by a non - thermal broad - band continuum emission which is highly variable on time scales from years down to minutes @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is characterized by two bumps in a @xmath4f@xmath5 representation .",
    "the first component peaks at energies between ir and hard x - rays , and is assumed to originate from leptonic synchrotron radiation .",
    "the maximum of the second peak lies in the @xmath3-ray energy regime .",
    "the origin of this peak can be explained by different and partially concurring models either relying on inverse compton scattering of electrons @xcite or proposing hadronic interactions inside the jet @xcite . in the case",
    "the synchrotron peak occurs at energies above @xmath6hz , ( according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) these blazars are called hbls ( high - frequency peaked bl lacertae objects ) and for peak energies of @xmath7hz ibls ( intermediate bl lacertae objects ) .",
    "as of april 2010 , altogether 29 blazars were established as vhe sources ( 24 of them hbls including m87 as misaligned blazar)rwagner / sources/ for an up - to - date list . ] , compared to six hbls , when the magic telescope began its regular observations in december 2004 .",
    "the sample presented here comprises 21 x - ray selected objects which were not detected in the vhe regime prior to the magic observations .",
    "nine of the objects were already observed between december 2004 and february 2006 and the upper limits of these observations are reported in @xcite .",
    "as there have been improvements within the magic analysis , the data of these objects were re - analyzed and the new results are presented in this work . since no significant detection was attained , upper limits on a 3@xmath8 ( 99.7% ) confidence level will be presented .",
    "none of the observed sources showed any variability on diurnal timescales in the vhe regime . assuming a positive detection in the case of a flaring state , the observations presented here",
    "provide a means of investigating the baseline emission of these objects .",
    "therefore , a stacking method applied to the blazar sample can reveal such an emission below the sensitivity limit for each individual object .",
    "together with veritas @xcite this is the second stacking analysis which turns out to be successful in the vhe @xmath3-ray regime .",
    "former experiments like hegra failed in detecting a significant signal in a stacking analysis due to their limited sensitivity ( cf .  for instance",
    "* ) .    in section [ sec : sample ]",
    "the selection criteria for the objects will be presented .",
    "the observations and the data analysis technique are described in section [ sec : obsanal ] .",
    "the analysis results are shown in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , a discussion of the results and inherent implications can be found in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we selected blazars from the compilations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , some objects were chosen based on the synchrotron peak luminosity from @xcite and one from the sedentary survey by @xcite .    the main selection criteria are the measured x - ray flux at 1kev and the distance of the objects . according to @xcite ,",
    "the synchrotron flux in the x - ray regime is connected to the flux in the vhe regime by @xmath9 assuming comparable synchrotron and compton peak luminosities .",
    "therefore objects with high x - ray fluxes are promising candidates for tev emission . as the absorption of @xmath3-rays within the extragalactic background light ( ebl , see e.g.",
    "* ) is energy dependent , it is particularly important in the vhe regime to avoid strong attenuation of @xmath3-rays by limiting the redshift range . according to @xcite , at a redshift of @xmath10 , the expected cutoff energy lies well above 200gev , allowing magic to observe still with its highest sensitivity .",
    "therefore all objects with a maximum redshift @xmath10 where considered .",
    "the energy threshold of the observations increases with the zenith distance @xmath11 . accounting for this effect",
    ", the selection of sources with higher @xmath11 ( @xmath12)during culmination should be limited to @xmath13 .",
    "the increasing effect of ebl absorption should , however , imprint itself by a net steepening on the spectrum of the stacked excess .",
    "all criteria are described in detail below .",
    "they have been chosen to enhance the probability to detect the sources , hence we selected objects with high fluxes and inverse compton peaks as well as allowing for the lowest possible energies to be measured with magic .    compared to @xcite , the selection criteria have been extended .",
    "the reason is the enhancement of the sample by taking a wider redshift or zenith distance range into account and including sources whose fitted synchrotron peak flux is high enough even if they show a lower x - ray flux level at 1kev .",
    "the sample is divided into four parts :    * * i. * x - ray selected hbls obtained from @xcite and @xcite : ( i ) redshift @xmath14 , ( ii ) x - ray flux @xmath15 , and ( iii ) zenith distance @xmath16 during culmination . assuming the same luminosities at 1kev as at 200gev ( following the argumentation of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , the x - ray flux @xmath17 corresponds to a @xmath3-ray flux at 200gev of @xmath18 .",
    "this criterion applies to 15 sources including nine sources already observed during cycle 1 of regular magic observations .",
    "the sources are listed in table  [ sample ] . *",
    "* ii . * two hbls obtained from the same compilations taking a wider range in declination and a lower maximum of the redshift into account : 1es 0033 + 59.5 and rxs j1136.5 + 6737 .",

    "selection criteria : ( i ) redshift @xmath20 , ( ii ) synchrotron peak frequency @xmath21 , ( iii ) flux at the peak @xmath22 , and ( iv ) zenith angle @xmath23 during culmination .",
    "this is valid for three sources : b2 1215 + 30 , pks 1424 + 240 , and b3 2247 + 381 .",
    "all of them can also be found in @xcite but with an x - ray flux at 1kev below 2@xmath0 .",
    "b2 1215 + 30 is listed there as lbl . in return",
    "it is included in the tev candidate list in @xcite .",
    "* one hbl from the sedentary survey @xcite with the same selection criteria as applied for point one of the sample : 1rxs j044127.8 + 150455 .",
    "as several other blazars fulfilling these selection criteria were already detected with magic or other vhe instruments , a post - priori selection was done using only the objects which were not yet detected in the vhe regime in advance of the magic observations leaving 21 objects as discussed herein .",
    "all blazars in the magic agn observation program that fulfill these selection criteria either have been detected ( or were known in advance ) or they are listed here as non - detections .",

    "the later detections show that the x - ray selection of possible targets is a reasonable approach .    in order to compare the measured integral fluxes with the upper limits presented here they are extrapolated to the individual energy thresholds as reported in table  [ results ] . in all cases except for pks 1424 + 240",
    "the upper limits are compatible with the extrapolated reported integral fluxes .      taking a look at the calculated significances of the blazar sample",
    "it is evident that most of the individual objects show positive values .",
    "plotting the distribution of the significances , the mean value is not located at 0 as expected for sky regions where no @xmath3-rays are expected to originate .        in figure  [ signdistr ] the significance distribution for the blazar sample is shown together with the result of a cross - check as described below .",

    "if the positive signal in the blazar sample originates from a systematic effect of the observations or analysis chain , we also cross - checked this result with data sets obtained as off pointings associated to different on source observations not treated in this paper .",
