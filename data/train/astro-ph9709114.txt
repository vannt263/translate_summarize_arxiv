    "recent observations have shown us that many ly @xmath2 clouds are contaminated with metals .",
    "associated civ absorption lines indicate that these clouds are likely to have about 1/100 solar metallicity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this puzzles us how such intergalactic clouds are metal - enriched , since metals must be synthesized in stars , i.e. in galaxies .",
    "another question is whether ly @xmath2 clouds with lower hi column densities are metal - enriched or not .    in this work",
    "we examine galactic wind driven by supernova explosions to provide metals to the igm , in order to find answers for above questions .",
    "we have examined three models to investigate how a galactic wind propagate and bring metallic gas to the igm on the minihalo model : a spherical cloud model , a grid toy model , and a 3d cdm model .",
    "assumptions over these models are summarized as follows : gas and dark matter are in a flat universe ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "stars are formed at high density and low temperature region .",
    "eleven percent of stars in mass become supernovae with releasing @xmath6erg and @xmath7 metallic gas per an average supernova which mass is @xmath8 .",
    "uniform uv background radiation is assumed with power - law spectrum of @xmath9 .",
    "the flux evolution model is assumed similarly to haardt & madau s model @xcite and @xmath10 at @xmath1 , where @xmath11 .",
    "for the spherical model the constant flux model with @xmath12 is also considered .",
    "this will change the formation epoch of stars .",
    "ionization equilibrium is assumed , and radiative cooling and uv heating are taken into account .",
    "first we examine propagation of a galactic wind from a minihalo with a simple spherical model .",
    "a system of dark matter and gas ( @xmath13 ) evolves from a gaussian density fluctuation @xcite .",
    "star formation criterion is set as @xmath14 , and @xmath15 stars are formed with the timescale , @xmath16 .",
    "an expanding shell due to supernova explosions propagates into the expanding region , being accumulated all gas which is collapsing onto the minihalo .",
    "the expansion is accelerated by the pressure gradient .",
    "the expanding velocity of the shell when it is propagating into the igm region is @xmath17km / s ( @xmath18yr ) . in this spherical model the metallic gas",
    "is confined in the hot cavity region .",
    "when @xmath16 is long such as @xmath19yr , supernovae do not produce an expanding shell",
    ". lasting period of the star formation is short @xmath20 .",
    "the stellar component ( @xmath21 ) distributes at @xmath22 kpc ( depending on the initial density fluctuation ) .",
    "average metallicity of the system is @xmath23 at @xmath24 .      to examine how metals expand in a space where voids ( low density region ) and gas sheets or wall ( high density region ) exist , we consider a toy model with grid geometry of walls and voids .",
    "here we consider a @xmath25 mpc box ( comoving ) with @xmath26 mesh and @xmath26 cdm particles .",
    "walls separate 8 void regions in the simulation box .",
    "the void under - density is assumed as @xmath27 and the wall over - density , @xmath28 .",
    "the wall width is put as @xmath29 mpc . a galaxy ( @xmath30 ) which is put near the center",
    "has supernova explosions at @xmath31 to spread out metallic gas into the igm .",
    "shocked hot gas shell following cool and dense gas shell expands in the igm .",
    "the wall prevents the shell expansion which propagates toward the voids with the expanding velocity , @xmath32km / s , at @xmath33 .",
    "most metallic gas is accumulated in the dense shell , where civ number density is high as well as hi number density .",
    "the unperturbed walls are not metal enriched .",
    "the igm metallicity is almost uniform from the central region to the dense shell . beyond the shell",
    "the metallicity decreases with decreasing gas density .",
    "we have performed 3d simulations in the cdm model to examine metal distribution of the igm .",
    "we take a @xmath34mpc ( comoving ) box with @xmath26 mesh and @xmath26 cdm particles .",
    "we assume @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for the cdm model .",
    "galaxies are assumed to form at a cell where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40k , and all gas in the cell is converted to stars .",
    "( e.g. @xcite . )",
    "supernovae are assumed to explode soon after galaxies are formed .",
    "first we find that supernova feedback acts to suppress galaxy formation near galaxies .",
    "the galaxy formation rate ( mass per unit redshift ) becomes nearly constant at @xmath41 , contrary to a model without supernova feedback , which rate show a peak around @xmath42 .",
    "the igm is heated by supernovae during @xmath43 , and by gravitational collapse at @xmath44 , in average .",
    "the metallicity distribution mostly traces the high density regions where galaxies are formed and metals are produced .",
    "some low density regions caused by galactic winds and bulk motion are found to have high metallicity .",
    "the metallicity is less than 1/100 @xmath45 at more than 90 % region at @xmath1 .",
    "supernova explosions produce two trends in plots of the metallicity vs. the gas density .",
    "the metallicity keeps high near galaxies with wide range of the gas density . on the other hand",
    ", expanding gas towards void regions makes a trend of lower metallicity with lower density .",
    "these trends are clearly seen in the toy grid model in  2.2 and were not found by models without supernova feedback @xcite .",
    "the civ column density , n(civ ) , spreads widely for a fixed hi column density , because of wide range of the metallicity . at @xmath1 all @xmath46",
    "n(hi)@xmath47 clouds seem to have n(civ)@xmath48 similarly to observations @xcite .",
    "the results of these models show that : ( 1 ) galactic winds from minihalos and galaxies carry metallic gas to the igm but are not powerful enough to pollute all the igm . even at @xmath49 only 30 % region has metallicity larger than @xmath0 ; and ( 2 ) civ absorption lines would be associated at high density regions .",
    "the civ column densities and metallicity are likely to show similar tendency to the observations .",
    "these models are still preliminary and we need more improvements . for example , simulations with higher spatial resolution would make a change of galaxy formation rate , because the formation criterion might allow to form more galaxies but increased number of supernovae would prevent succeeding formation of galaxies .",
    "the change of the galaxy formation rate will affect the precise metallicity distribution .",
    "improved models are being planed to examine , which will give us more realistic information on the metallicity of the igm .    99 bond j. r. , szalay a. s. , & silk j. , 1988 , 324 , 627 cen r. , miralda - escud j. , ostriker j. p. , & rauch m. , 1994 , 437 , l9 cowie l. l. , songaila a. , kim t .- s .",
