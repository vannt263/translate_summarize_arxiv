    "in march 2008 , christian marois noticed one ( figure 1 , left panel ) , and then two , faint point sources located at a projected separation of 68 and 38 au from the nearby , dusty a5 star hr 8799 .",
    "follow - up observations in july ",
    "september 2008 confirmed that these objects were bound companions and added a third at @xmath2 @xmath3 24 au ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ma08 ) .",
    "two years later , @xcite announced the discovery of a fourth companion at @xmath2 @xmath3 15 au : hr 8799 e ( figure 1 , right panel ) . given the estimated age of the system ( @xmath4 @xmath3 30 @xmath5 , ma08 , baines et al .",
    "2012 ) , hr 8799 bcde s low luminosities imply masses of @xmath0 57 @xmath6 , below the deuterium - burning limit ( @xmath0 13 @xmath6 ) nominally separating planets from brown dwarfs .",
    "analyses focused on atmospheric modeling ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cu11 ) , dynamical stability ( @xcite ; cu11 ) , and formation ( @xcite ; cu11 ) likewise corroborate the conclusion that hr 8799 bcde are bona fide planets , not brown dwarfs .",
    "the hr 8799 planetary system resembles a scaled - up version of our outer solar system . the planets orbit in between a warm dust belt ( @xmath7 @xmath0 6 - 12 au ) and a cold kuiper belt - like structure at @xmath8 @xmath0 90145 au @xcite . due to",
    "hr 8799 s higher luminosity , the planets and dust belt populations receive about as much energy as the solar system s gas / ice giant planets and asteroid belt / kuiper belt receive from the sun .",
    "hr 8799 harbors arguably not just the _ first _ directly - imaged planets and thermal emission at longer wavelengths @xcite , later work cast doubt on its existence ( janson et al .",
    "2012 ) and then showed that instead fomalhaut b is made visible entirely by circumplanetary dust emission @xcite .",
    "thus , it is on slightly shakier ground and instead , as noted in @xcite , is likely a  planet [ of unknown mass ] _ identified by direct imaging _ but not a _ directly - imaged _ planet . \" while other planet - mass objects were announced prior to hr 8799 bcd ( e.g. 2 m 1207 b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their lower mass ratios ( compared to the primary ) and/or wider separations suggest that they represent the low - mass tail of the substellar mass function . ] but among the best studied ones .",
    "photometry and/or low - resolution spectroscopy for hr 8799 bcde span 15 @xmath9 ( e.g. cu11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "hr 8799 bc have 1.42.5 @xmath9 medium - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "after the reported discovery of hr 8799 bcd , multiple studies revealed at least one of the hr 8799 planets from data between 1998 and 2007 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the planets have been imaged by nearly all other 58 m telescopes with adaptive optics systems ( e.g. cu11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this wealth of data makes hr 8799 a benchmark system for studying the atmospheres , orbital properties , dynamical stability , and formation of young superjovian planets .",
    "hr 8799 bcde provide the first glimpse at how the atmospheric properties of young , self - luminous planets compare to both old field brown dwarfs and younger , lower - mass brown dwarfs .",
    "typical luminosity evolution models ( e.g.  hot start \" models ) predict that directly - imaged , superjovian ( 510 @xmath6 ) planets between 10 and 100 @xmath5 old cover a temperature range of @xmath0 600 to 1800 @xmath10 characteristic of field early l to late t dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "coarsely speaking , the l to t transition at @xmath0 12001400 @xmath10 ( for the field ) covers a transition from an object with a near - infrared spectrum lacking methane absorption and a cloudy atmosphere to an object with near - infrared methane absorption and weaker / negligible clouds @xcite . for ages of @xmath3 30 @xmath5 and masses of 57 @xmath6",
    ", standard luminosity evolution models predict that the hr 8799 planets should , if like field objects , have temperatures of @xmath11 @xmath0 8501100 @xmath10 characteristic of mid / late field t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "ma08 found hints of differences between the hr 8799 planets infrared ( ir ) colors and the field l / t dwarf sequence .",
    "subsequent studies that focused on a wider range of hr 8799 planet colors reveal clear departures from the field sequence ( @xcite ; cu11 ) . compared to mid / late t dwarfs , hr 8799 b(cd ) are up to 2.5 ( 1.5 ) magnitudes redder ( cu11 ) . generally speaking , hr 8799 bcde appear to lie on a reddened extension of the l dwarf sequence past the field l / t transition to fainter magnitudes , a sparsely populated region whose other members are almost unanimously young , low ( planetary ) mass , and low gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the hr 8799 planets ir spectral shapes likewise reveal differences with field objects but ( imperfect ) similarities with young , dusty , and low - gravity / mass brown dwarfs .",
    "although formally no object appears well matched to hr 8799 bc s combined near - ir spectra and thermal ir photometry , reddened versions of the youngest t0 dwarf spectra reproduce their spectra well @xcite .",
    "hr 8799 de appear best matched by particularly red and dusty / low gravity l6-l8 dwarfs which likewise deviate from the field sequence .",
    "however , fitting near ir and thermal - ir data simultaneously remains challenging .    as shown in cu11",
    ", the hr 8799 planets appear different than field brown dwarfs of the same effective temperatures in large part because they have thicker clouds ( figure 2 ) .",
    "thicker clouds change the optical depth profile as a function of wavelength , making it more uniform in and out of major molecular opacity sources ( e.g. water ) since the @xmath12 = 1 surface is achieved at a more uniform altitude .",
    "the planet spectrum appears redder and more blackbody like .",
    "furthermore , the clouds may be non - uniformly distributed or ",
    "patchy \" ( cu11 ) with 10 - 50% of the visible surface covered by thinner clouds / cloudless regions .",
    "additionally , at least some hr 8799 planets show clear evidence for non - equilibrium carbon chemistry @xcite .",
    "in addition to the absence of strong @xmath13 absorption in hr 8799 b s low - resolution near - ir spectrum , at longer wavelengths at least some of the planets exhibit weak to negligible methane absorption at 3.3 @xmath9 and enhanced @xmath14 absorption at 5 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "medium - resolution near - ir spectra for hr 8799 bc reveal molecular species in the planets atmospheres and additional evidence for non - equilibrium carbon chemistry @xcite .",
    "the planets low surface gravities ( and , thus , their youth and low mass ) explain both thick clouds and non - equilibrium carbon chemistry . lower gravities ( log(g ) @xmath3 4 instead of @xmath3 5 for field objects ; cu11 , konopacky et al .",
    "2013 ) yield temperature - pressure profiles more characteristic of hotter , cloudier l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "lower gravities also move the depth at which carbon - based chemical reactions ( i.e. co+3h@xmath15 @xmath16@xmath17 ch@xmath18 + h@xmath150 ) are quenched deeper in the atmosphere , resulting in an overabundance of co @xcite .",
    "other young , directly - imaged 513 @xmath1 planetary - mass objects with a range of temperatures also show evidence for thicker clouds and/or non - equilibrium carbon chemistry ( e.g. roxs 42bb and 2 m 1207 b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the lowest mass , coldest and oldest imaged planets have very different spectra @xcite .",
    "hr 8799 bcde s orbits provide crucial input for studying the configuration of multi - planet systems and a limit on the planets masses .",
    "soon after hr 8799 bcd were announced , @xcite noted that for nominal face - on orbits and nominal masses , the system would be dynamically unstable in 0.1 @xmath5 , far less than the system age .",
    "placing these planets in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance makes the system dynamically stable for tens of @xmath5 up to masses of 1020 @xmath6 .",
    "however , a 4th planet at 15 au makes dynamical stability more challenging , favoring masses of 5 ( 7 ) @xmath6 or less for hr 8799 b ( cde ) and precluding masses above 13 @xmath6 ( marois et al .",
    "2010 ; cu11 ) .",
    "assuming different orbital properties ( e.g. inclined orbits ) further lowers the maximum allowable planet masses ( e.g. less than 10 @xmath6 * ? ? ?",
    "hr 8799 bcde are not in face - on orbits but instead are inclined between 20 and 45@xmath19 from face - on @xcite , similar to hr 8799 a s rotation axis and the inclination of the star s cold debris disk @xcite .",
    "circular orbits are formally consistent with the data for all planets @xcite .",
    "hr 8799 bcd s allowable orbits include a stabilizing 4:2:1 resonance , a possible outcome of the planets formation / migration histories ( figure 3 , konopacky et al .",
    "2016 ; gozdziewski & migazewski 2014 ) .",
    "however , it is unclear whether a 2:1 or 3:2 resonance is favored between hr 8799 d and e @xcite .",
    "the planets relative inclinations are uncertain .",
    "@xcite argue that coplanar orbits comprise a small fraction of acceptable orbits drawn from 1998 - 2010 measurements but are still possible ; @xcite suggest that the planets orbits are not coplanar . while konopacky et al .",
    "( 2016 ) find no evidence for non - coplanarity from a set of self - consistently reduced data sets originating from the same telescope / instrument configuration , they do not consider astrometry for hr 8799 d ( bc ) prior to 2007 ( 2004 ) , measurements largely responsible for favoring non - coplanarity .",
    "hr 8799 bcde are important tests of jovian planet formation .",
    "forming 57 @xmath6 planets at 2570 au in situ by core accretion is extremely difficult , consistent with the fact that hr 8799-like planetary systems are extremely rare ( e.g. galicher et al .",
    "the mass ratios and separations of the hr 8799 planets are contiguous with the population of radial - velocity / transit detected planets , at least some of which formed by core accretion ( cu11;@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , uncommon conditions  a particularly massive disk , very rapid and efficient build up of protoplanetary cores , and/or scattering of massive cores to wider separations prior to runaway gas accretion ( e.g. @xcite ; cu11 ; @xcite) are likely required to explain hr 8799 bcde .",
    "atmospheric chemistry may also provide clues to hr 8799 bcde s formation . if the planets formed by disk instability , their atmospheres should have solar c / o ratios ; if they formed by core accretion near their current locations with a modest intake of solids , they should have enhanced c / o @xcite . while hr 8799 c may have an enhanced c / o ratio ,",
    "hr 8799 b s c / o ratio is less constrained @xcite .",
    "many challenges remain in better understanding the atmospheres , orbits , and formation of the hr 8799 planets . for example , hr 8799 b remains a sort of  kobayashi maru \" test for planet atmosphere models , as not a single one has reproduced all of the planet s spectrophotometry while yielding parameters ( e.g. mass , radius ) that are physically plausible and consistent with other constraints ( planet cooling models ; dynamical stability limits ) . likely",
    "( partial ) solutions to this problem include updated near - ir opacities and a better understanding of clouds at low gravities . by 2019",
    ", we will have astrometric points for roughly 20% of hr 8799 d and e s orbit .",
    "new data combined with a self - consistent reanalysis of older astrometry will be needed to better constrain key orbital properties ( e.g. resonances , eccentricities , and coplanarity ) .",
    "the next generation of extremely large telescopes will provide powerful probes of the hr 8799 planets chemical abundances , gravity , and formation history .",
    "for example , the _ iris _ integral field spectrograph on the _ thirty meter telescope _ covers 0.82.5 @xmath9 and should be capable of providing high signal - to - noise spectra of all four planets at @xmath20 = 40008000 , building upon previous keck / osiris studies of hr 8799 bc at @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands @xcite .",
    "such data should resolve multiple gravity sensitive lines and better determine abundances of multiple species . as a result",
    ", we may better constrain the c / o ratio and formation environment for planets of comparable mass from 15 au to 70 au .",
