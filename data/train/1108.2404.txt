    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos produced in collisionless cosmological @xmath6-body simulations follow a nearly universal mass - density profile that diverges toward the center as @xmath7 with @xmath8 , forming a so - called ` cusp ' ( @xcite , @xcite ( ` nfw ' hereafter ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "many observations aim to test this scenario by using the measured motions of dynamical tracers in individual galaxies to constrain slopes of the underlying dark matter density profiles ( e.g. , @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) .",
    "however , comparisons to cosmological models tend to be inconclusive for the simple reason that while most cosmological n - body simulations consider only dark matter particles , one observes only baryons .",
    "baryons complicate not only the measurement of a dark matter density profile but also its interpretation within the context of the cdm paradigm . complicating the measurement is the fact that any uncertainty ( e.g. , uncertain stellar mass - to - light ratios ) in the baryonic mass profile propagates to the inferred dark matter profile , as the latter is merely the difference between dynamical and baryonic mass profiles . complicating",
    "the interpretation of even a clean measurement is the possibility that various poorly - understood dynamical processes involving baryons might alter the original structure of a dark matter halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one mitigates both of these complications at once by considering the milky way s ( mw s ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites , which have the smallest sizes ( @xmath9 pc ) , smallest baryonic masses ( @xmath10 ) and the largest dynamical mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath11/[m / l_v]_{\\odot}\\ga 10 $ ] ) of any observed galaxies ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , @xcite ) .",
    "dark matter dominates even at the centers of dsph gravitational potential wells , implying that uncertainties in baryonic mass profiles have negligible impact on inferred dark matter profiles .",
    "furthermore , dynamical processes that invoke baryon physics to alter the central structure of dark matter halos are subject to strong constraints in dsphs , where one finds the smallest baryon densities and infers the largest dark matter densities of any galaxy type @xcite .",
    "recent work identifies several mechanisms that in principle are capable of altering the central structure  i.e .",
    ", of transforming primal ` cusps ' into ` cores ' of constant density  of cold dark matter halos on dsph - like scales .",
    "such mechanisms typically invoke either the dynamical coupling of the dark matter to rapid baryonic outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the transfer of energy and/or angular momentum to the dark matter from massive infalling objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while both channels for baryon - driven core creation are physically plausible , their application to real dsphs must eventually satisfy a large body of observational constraints .",
    "it is therefore instructive to consider recent high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these cosmological simulations broadly reproduce the observed distributions of luminosities , metallicities and stellar kinematics exhibited by local group dsphs .",
    "both groups conclude that the baryon - physical processes driving the formation and evolution of their simulated dsphs leave the cuspy central structure of dsph cdm halos intact . taking these results at face value",
    ", it seems then that the local group dsphs represent the most pristine dark matter halos to which we have observational access . measurements of the slopes ( i.e. ` cusp ' versus ` core ' ) of dsph mass profiles can therefore provide a uniquely direct test of structure formation within the cdm paradigm .",
    "pressure - supported stellar components provide the only available kinematic tracers in dsphs , but thus far stellar kinematic data have figured only indirectly in core / cusp investigations .",
    "for example , @xcite detect kinematically cold stellar substructure in the ursa minor dsph and argue that its survival against tidal disruption is more likely in a cored as opposed to a cusped host potential . @xcite and @xcite argue that the wide spatial distribution of the five globular clusters in the fornax dsph again favors a cored host potential , as dynamical friction within a centrally cusped potential would have caused the clusters to sink to fornax s center in less than a hubble time ( unless those clusters had much wider orbits initially ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite argue that the mass  size relation traced by the milky way s dsph population favors evolutionary scenarios that invoke cusped as opposed to cored halos .",
    "in contrast to the studies mentioned above , here we devise a method for measuring the slopes of dsph mass profiles directly from stellar spectroscopic data .",
    "we proceed by combining two recent results .",
    "first , for a spherically symmetric dsph in dynamic equilibrium , the product of halflight radius and ( squared ) velocity dispersion provides an estimate of the mass enclosed within the halflight radius @xcite .",
    "second , some dsphs contain at least two chemo - dynamically distinct stellar populations @xcite , each presumably tracing the same dark matter potential .",
    "here we formulate a mathematical model that uses measurements of stellar positions , velocities and spectral indices to distinguish two dsph stellar subcomponents and to estimate their individual halflight radii and velocity dispersions . for a dsph with",
    "two detected stellar subcomponents , we obtain estimates of masses enclosed at two discrete points in the same mass profile .",
    "two points define a slope .      in principle",
    "the collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe , equation 4.6 of @xcite ) relates the 6-dimensional phase - space distribution function , @xmath12 , of a tracer component to the underlying gravitational potential , thereby governing the joint distribution of stellar positions and velocities for a pressure - supported galaxy in dynamic equilibrium . in practice",
    "the available dsph data provide information in only three dimensions  two spatial dimensions orthogonal to the line of sight and one velocity dimension along the line of sight .",
    "implementation of the cbe with dsph data then requires transformations between 6d and 3d ( or 2d with spherical symmetry ) phase - space distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , often at significant computational expense .",
    "many dsph kinematic studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) rely instead on the jeans equations , obtained by integrating the cbe over velocity space .",
    "the spherically symmetric jeans equation specifies the mass profile @xmath13including the contribution from any dark matter component  in terms of the stellar density profile , @xmath14 , and stellar velocity dispersion profile , @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are components of the velocity dispersion in radial and tangential directions , respectively .",
    "confinement of dsph stellar velocity data to the component along the line of sight leaves the velocity anisotropy  usually quantified by the ratio @xmath19poorly constrained , ultimately precluding model - independent constraints on the mass profile in analyses based on equation [ eq : jeans ] .",
    "for example , the top panel of figure [ fig : for_profiles ] demonstrates that the projected velocity dispersion profile observed for the fornax dsph can be fit equally well by jeans models that assume either cored or nfw - cusped dark matter halos , or if the shape of the dark matter halo is unspecified , by models that assume the velocity distribution is either isotropic , radially anisotropic or tangentially anisotropic .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : for_profiles ] demonstrates that despite this well - known degeneracy between mass and anisotropy , the various successful jeans models tend to have the same mass enclosed within approximately the dsph halflight radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , given the general flatness of dsph velocity dispersion profiles @xcite , the value of this mass relates simply to the product of velocity dispersion and the halflight radius of the adopted surface brightness model .",
    "assuming that the stellar component follows a plummer profile ( @xmath20^{-5/2}$ ] ) and has an isotropic ( @xmath21 ) velocity distribution with constant dispersion , @xcite derive from equation [ eq : jeans ] the simple estimator @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the projected halflight radius and @xmath24 is the square of the velocity dispersion . equation [ eq : walker ] provides estimates of @xmath25 that agree well with formal constraints from searches of many - dimensional parameter spaces often invoked in jeans models ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "this agreement follows from the fact that for flat velocity dispersion profiles and the adoption of a plummer surface brightness profile , the two observables @xmath23 and @xmath24 already contain all of the empirical information that enters equation [ eq : jeans ] .",
    "thus equation [ eq : walker ] provides reasonably model - independent estimates of masses enclosed within dsph projected halflight radii ( see section [ subsubsec : masses ] for an examination of bias ) .",
    "@xcite show that an alternative estimator , which can be expressed as @xmath26 , gives model - independent estimates of dsph masses at slightly larger radii ( approximately the deprojected halflight radius ) where good - fitting mass profiles intersect with slightly less scatter . for our purposes here , all estimators of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is some constant , are equivalent .",
    "the ability to make a robust estimate of the mass enclosed within the halflight radius of a dsph stellar population takes on additional significance given recent discoveries that at least some dsphs have multiple stellar populations , each of which can serve as an independent tracer of the underlying gravitational potential . using vlt / flames spectroscopy of @xmath29 stars in the sculptor dsph , @xcite find evidence for two ancient stellar subcomponents that follow distinct distributions in position , velocity and metallicity . imposing a metallicity cut to divide their spectroscopic sample into relatively ` metal - rich ' and ` metal - poor ' subcomponents ,",
    "@xcite find that the metal - rich subcomponent is more centrally concentrated and kinematically colder than the metal - poor subcomponent .",
    "@xcite and @xcite report similar discoveries for the fornax and sextans dsphs based on vlt / flames samples of @xmath30 and @xmath31 member stars , respectively  in both galaxies a relatively metal - rich subcomponent is again more centrally concentrated and has smaller velocity dispersion than a metal - poorer , kinematically hotter , more extended subcomponent .",
    "@xcite report similar phenomenology based on keck / deimos observations of 44 members of the cvni dsph (",
    "although follow - up keck / deimos observations by @xcite do not reproduce this result ) .",
    "several other dsphs , including carina , tucana and some m31 satellites display evidence for distinct stellar subcomponents in the form of differing spatial distributions of blue- and red - horizontal branch stars @xcite , but these separations have not yet been linked to stellar kinematics .",
    "there are two previously - published efforts to model dsphs as superpositions of two dynamically independent stellar subcomponents tracing the same dark matter potential .",
    "@xcite find that the spatial and velocity distributions of several dsphs , including satellites of both the milky way and m31 , are compatible with the presence of dynamically distinct stellar subcomponents embedded within cuspy nfw halos . @xcite",
    "apply more general dark matter halo models , considering cored as well as cuspy nfw halos .",
    "@xcite find that while both types of halos can plausibly host the two stellar subcomponents they detect in sculptor , the cored halo gives a better fit to the falling velocity dispersion profile they measure for sculptor s metal - rich subcomponent .",
    "in contrast to these previous studies , here we do not adopt a dark matter halo model . nor do we use rigid color / metallicity cuts to separate metal - rich and metal - poor subcomponents ( c.f .",
    "instead we devise a statistical technique for the purpose of separating and quantifying the radius , metallicity and velocity distributions followed by two distinct dsph stellar subcomponents that independently trace the same gravitational potential . where we can resolve a dsph into two distinct stellar subcomponents and measure the halflight radii and velocity dispersions of both subcomponents , we effectively resolve two discrete points in a mass profile dominated by dark matter .",
    "the slope then follows directly .",
    "we use the spectroscopic data published by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* w09 hereafter ) for three of the milky way s ` classical ' dsph satellites : carina , fornax and sculptor .",
    "these data were compiled over five years ( 20042008 ) of observations with the magellan / clay ( 6.5 m ) telescope and michigan / mike fiber spectrograph ( mmfs , pi : mario mateo , co - i : ed olszewski ) at las campanas observatory , chile .",
    "mmfs spectra cover the range @xmath32   ",
    "@xmath33   at high resolution ( @xmath34 ) , including the prominent magnesium triplet ( mgt ) absorption feature ; see ( * ? ?",
    "* w07 hereafter ) and w09 for details of observations and data reduction .",
    "the resulting data set includes line - of - sight velocities and spectral indices measured individually for @xmath35 red giant candidates in the three dsphs . for the present study",
    "we exclude the @xmath36 stars for which w09 measure a velocity but do not report a value for the magnesium index ( due to insufficient signal ) .",
    "table [ tab : mmfs ] gives central coordinates , heliocentric distances and integrated luminosities @xcite for these three galaxies and lists the numbers of stars ( including foreground interlopers ) in the mmfs spectroscopic samples used here .    for three reasons we exclude from the present study the available mmfs data for the sextans dsph .",
    "first , the mmfs data set for sextans is relatively small , containing velocities for just @xmath37 stars , of which only @xmath38 are sextans members .",
    "second , the method we introduce below requires calibrated broad - band photometry ( section [ subsec : velocities ] ) , and as reported by w09 , poor observing conditions precluded accurate calibration of the photometry used to select sextans targets .",
    "third , in order to compensate for this shortcoming , w09 report calibrated photometry for @xmath39 of their sextans targets ( @xmath40 members ) using the catalog of @xcite .",
    "however , this catalog covers only a few percent of the total surface area of sextans , complicating the correction for sampling bias that we discuss in section [ subsec : selection ] .",
    "thus a comparable analysis of sextans , which we leave for future work , would require more complete photometry and/or careful accounting for these deficiencies .",

    ", pseudo - equivalent widths of resolved fe and mg absorption lines  measured from mmfs spectra correlate with stellar atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity ( see figures 19 - 20 of w07 ) .",
    "w07 combine indices measured separately for magnesium - triplet lines at @xmath57   and @xmath58   into a composite mgt index , denoted @xmath59 , that is qualitatively similar to the composite calcium - triplet index , @xmath60 , often used to infer stellar metallicities from near - infrared calcium - triplet spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    like the @xmath60 index ,",
    "the @xmath59 index provides a measure of stellar - atmospheric metal abundance , provided that empirical calibrations adequately remove the dependences of mg opacity on effective temperature and surface gravity . for red giant stars that brighten and cool",
    "as they expand , these dependences translate ( for stars of a given metallicity ) into a nearly linear empirical relationship between @xmath59 and luminosity .",
    "w09 ( their figure 3 ) quantify this relationship using mmfs observations of red giants in six globular clusters that span the metallicity range @xmath61 } \\la -0.5 $ ] and have negligible ( for our purposes ) internal metallicity spreads .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , w09 simultaneously fit the data for each cluster with straight lines sharing a common slope , obtaining @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the offset in @xmath64band luminosity from the horizontal branch .",
    "the slope quantifies the dependence of opacity on effective temperature and surface gravity , using luminosity as a proxy .",
    "the intercept , or ` reduced ' index @xmath65henceforth denoted @xmath66represents the value of @xmath59 that the star would have if it had the surface gravity and temperature of a horizontal branch star .",
    "then taking the empirical calibration given by equation [ eq : wprime ] at face value , red giants of similar metallicity should have similar @xmath66 .",
    "using the horizontal - branch magnitudes listed in table [ tab : mmfs ] , we apply equation [ eq : wprime ] to obtain reduced magnesium indices @xmath66 for all dsph stars in the magellan / mmfs sample . since we are concerned with stellar - atmospheric chemistry only as a diagnostic with which to distinguish stellar subcomponents independently of their velocity distributions , we do not require further calibration of @xmath66 values onto an absolute metallicity scale . in what follows we shall use @xmath66 as an indicator of _ relative _ metallicity and we shall refer to subcomponents distinguished by @xmath66 as ` metal - rich ' and ` metal - poor ' .",
    "w07 ( see their figure 1 ) chose dsph stellar targets from selection boxes overlaid on red giant branches ( rgbs ) apparent from @xmath67 , @xmath68 photometry of each system .",
    "these selection regions include contamination from foreground milky way stars ( typically late - type dwarfs ) and background point sources ( unresolved galaxies , quasars ) .",
    "fortunately , bona fide dsph members follow conspicuous distributions in velocity , spectral index and position , which helps to distinguish them from contaminant populations .",
    "the mmfs data published by w09 include for each star a probability of dsph membership that is derived from an expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm @xcite , similar to algorithms previously used to determine membership in open clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the em algorithm used by @xcite adopts the foreground velocity distribution given by the besanon milky way model @xcite and assumes a single dsph stellar component . because the latter assumption obviously is at odds with the two - subcomponent models we shall consider here , we use w09 s membership probabilities only to provide non - parametric estimates of position , velocity and mg - index distributions followed by non - members ( section [ subsec : foreground ] ) .",
    "the accuracy with which we recover the input member fraction in tests of our method ( section [ subsec : mcmcresults ] ) indicates that these estimates are not unduly influenced by the subtle differences between foreground probabilities derived from single and multi - component dsph models .",
    "finally , in light of the fact that here we use the positions of stars in the mmfs samples to estimate halflight radii of the stellar populations to which they belong , we must consider the fact that the spatial distributions of mmfs - observed stars may differ from those of the populations from which they are drawn .",
    "each mmfs configuration is limited to @xmath69 targets within a @xmath70 field of view , and therefore the distribution of stellar positions is not sampled randomly .    in order to compensate for selection effects due to the inevitable peculiarities of spectroscopic spatial sampling ,",
    "we assign a selection probability to each star according to the local ratio of the number of observed stars , @xmath71 , to the number of target candidates , @xmath72 , selected according to w07 s photometric criteria ( the latter number includes both observed and unobserved stars ) .",
    "we estimate this ratio as a function of projected radius by smoothing the data and target catalogs with gaussian kernels : @xmath73}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\mathrm{cand}}}\\exp\\biggl[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(r_i - r)^2}{k_1 ^ 2}\\biggr ] } ,      \\label{eq : weight}\\ ] ] where the hat ( @xmath74 ) symbol denotes a quantity estimated via kernel smoothing .",
    "figure [ fig : weightbandwidth ] displays @xmath75 curves for each dsph and for possible choices of bandwidth over the range @xmath76these smoothing scales are smaller than the scale radius of the composite stellar component and larger than the ( projected ) mean free path of sampled stars . for the present work we adopt @xmath77 arcmin ( dotted red curves in figure [ fig : weightbandwidth ] ) , but we have confirmed that our results and conclusions are not qualitatively sensitive to this choice .",
    "we model each dsph mathematically as the superposition of two chemo - dynamically distinct stellar subcomponents observed through foreground contamination . for ` metal - rich ' and",
    "` metal - poor ' stellar subcomponents we adopt simple parametric models to describe the distributions of projected radius , line - of - sight velocity and magnesium index ( sections [ subsec : rdist ] - [ subsec : mgdist ] ) . for the foreground contamination",
    "we estimate these distributions non - parametrically by smoothing the spectroscopic data according to the published probability of ( non- ) membership for each star ( section [ subsec : foreground ] ) .",
    "we constrain model parameters using a standard markov - chain monte carlo algorithm ( section [ subsec : mcmc ] ) .",
    "the algorithm returns estimates of parameters including halflight radii and velocity dispersions for the two stellar subcomponents , which simultaneously provide estimates of the mass enclosed at the halflight radius of each subcomponent ( equation [ eq : walker ] ) as well as the slope of the mass profile : @xmath78}{\\log [ r_{\\mathrm{h,2}}/r_{\\mathrm{h,1}}]}\\approx 1+\\frac{\\log [ \\sigma^2_{v,2}/\\sigma^2_{v,1}]}{\\log [ r_{\\mathrm{h,2}}/r_{\\mathrm{h,1}}]}.    \\label{eq : slope}\\ ] ] the last expression on the right - hand side follows from equation [ eq : walker ] or , more generally , from any mass estimator of the form @xmath79 where @xmath28 is some constant ( e.g. @xcite ) , and makes explicit the fact that the only physical quantities relevant to our estimate of the slope @xmath5 are the sizes and velocity dispersions of the two stellar subcomponents .",

    "this lack of a dependence on anisotropy can be understood phenomenologically upon re - examination of figure [ fig : prof_vdisp ] .",
    "there we find that for fixed @xmath209 and @xmath195 , projected velocity dispersion profiles corresponding to isotropic and anisotropic distribution functions intersect at approximately the luminous scale radius , @xmath258 .",
    "this is also the radius where the differential spatial distribution @xmath252 reaches a maximum ( top panel of figure [ fig : prof_vdisp ] ) .",
    "therefore , samples drawn from both isotropic and the anisotropic distribution functions tend to be dominated by stars at radii where the difference in velocity dispersion between the two cases is negligible . as a result",
    ", we measure similar velocity dispersions and therefore obtain similar mass estimates for isotropic and anisotropic cases .",
    "second , figure [ fig : jorgetest ] shows that while the magnitude of the error depends on whether the dark matter halo is cored or cusped , for both types of halo the error varies with the embeddedness of the stellar component ( as quantified by the ratio @xmath195 ) in the same way .",
    "specifically , values of @xmath259 ) obtained from equation [ eq : walker ] are more strongly over - estimated for stellar components that are more deeply embedded ( smaller @xmath195 ) in their respective dark matter halos .",
    "these tests indicate that this bias is inherent in mass estimators of the form @xmath260 ( where @xmath261 is the global velocity dispersion ) .",
    "having identified biases inherent in our mass estimator itself , we now examine how those systematic errors propagate through our mcmc analysis . in order to see how our errors depend not only on the central slope of the dark matter density profile , but also on velocity anisotropy and embeddedness of the stellar subcomponent , we now stack error distributions corresponding to input models that have the same values of @xmath209 , @xmath202 and @xmath195 .",
    "we do not break results down further according to the input values of @xmath262 because we find no significant dependence of the mass errors on this parameter ( see , e.g. , figure [ fig : jorgetest ] ) .",

    "this peculiarity follows from the fact that for these particular models , the input ` global ' ( i.e. , calculated from a large sample of velocities drawn randomly from the subcomponent s distribution function ) velocity dispersions are @xmath268 km s@xmath55 ( see figure [ fig : prof_vdisp ] ) , similar to the mmfs velocity errors adopted for our tests",
    ". we resolve these small dispersions only marginally and our resulting estimates are biased toward values that are smaller than the input global dispersions .",
    "the corresponding masses are therefore not overestimated as strongly as would be expected from the bias that is inherent in the mass estimator .",
    "this complication does not affect the velocity dispersions ( or masses ) we measure for subcomponents in real dsphs ( section [ sec : results ] ) , which are all @xmath269 km s@xmath55 and thus well resolved with mmfs data .",
    "for the present study we are concerned primarily with the error associated with our measurement of the slope @xmath5 .",
    "the most important result from our tests with synthetic data is the finding that regardless of whether the dark matter halo is cored or cusped , isotropic or anisotropic , our method tends to return more strongly over - estimated masses when the stellar subcomponent is more deeply embedded within the dark matter halo ( figures [ fig : jorgetest ] and [ fig : jorge2compnojeansflatpmpmem_masses ] ) .",

    "the fact that we tend to underestimate @xmath5 implies that inequalities [ eq : inequality1 ] and [ eq : inequality2 ] continue to hold if the true value of @xmath5 is replaced by our estimate .",
    "we note that the tests described in this section cover a finite range of dynamical models . in principle",
    "there is no limit to the number and variety of models that might be applied to dsphs .",
    "in addition to the models described in this section , we have performed a similar set of tests using dynamical models that allow for either constant radial ( @xmath283 ) or constant tangential ( @xmath284 ) velocity anisotropy .",
    "the corresponding distribution functions were sampled by mark wilkinson ( private communication ) , as described by @xcite . in response to a request from the referee , we have also tested a model that reproduces the velocity dispersion profiles ( particularly the steeply falling profile of the inner component ) measured by @xcite for metal - rich and metal - poor subcomponents in the sculptor dsph .",
    "we find that we can reproduce these profiles with a model in which inner ( outer ) subcomponents follow @xcite surface density profiles with core radii @xmath285 pc ( @xmath286 pc ) , tidal radii @xmath287 ( @xmath288 ) , osipkov - merritt anisotropy radii @xmath289 pc ( @xmath290 pc ) , and are embedded in a cored ( @xmath176 ) dark matter halo with central density @xmath291 and scale radius @xmath292 pc . in our tests of these additional dynamical models",
    "we continue to find the same tendency to over - estimate @xmath25 according to the degree to which the stellar component is embedded within the dark matter halo , and thus the same tendency to underestimate @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we note that while the test models that we have considered include complexities ( rising / falling velocity dispersion profiles and non - plummer stellar density profiles ) that violate the assumptions of our method and give rise to the systematic errors that we have identified , there is no doubt that real dsphs have additional complexities that we have not simulated in our tests .",
    "examples may include non - sphericity of stellar and dark matter distributions , non - equilibrium kinematics , internal rotational components , binary stars , the presence of _ three _ or more distinct stellar subcomponents , etc . in section [ sec : discussion ]",

    "we now apply our method to the published mmfs data for the carina , fornax and sculptor dsphs .",

    "table [ tab : mcmcresults ] lists for each parameter the median value from the posterior pdf , with error bars indicating intervals that enclose the central @xmath293 ( and @xmath294 ) of values .",
    "our method returns no compelling evidence for chemo - dynamically distinct stellar subcomponents in carina , for which we obtain @xmath295 ( the 95% error is consistent with @xmath296 ) .",
    "this non - detection may be surprising given carina s episodic star formation history as evidenced by its two horizontal branches @xcite and three main - sequence turn - offs @xcite .",
    "however , a previous analysis by @xcite of an independent vlt / flames data set uncovers only a weak metallicity gradient in carina , a result qualitatively reproduced using mmfs data @xcite .",
    "thus while carina may in fact have independent stellar populations , the apparently weak coupling of chemical and dynamical properties prevents a clear separation using our method .",
    "as we do not clearly separate two stellar subcomponents , we obtain no meaningful estimate of @xmath5 for carina .    for the single stellar component that includes a fraction @xmath297 of stars in the carina field , our method returns estimates of the halflight radius ( @xmath298 pc ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath299 km s@xmath55 ) that agree with previously published values based on analyses that assume a single stellar component ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the proper motion returned by our method ( @xmath300 mas / century , @xmath301 mas / century ; see also @xcite ) is weakly constrained but agrees with the hst astrometric measurement @xcite .      for the remainder of this section we shall consider only fornax and sculptor , for both of which our method clearly distinguishes two stellar subcomponents .",
    "we find that a fraction @xmath302 of fornax members belong to a relatively metal - rich subcomponent ( @xmath303  ) with @xmath304 pc and velocity dispersion @xmath305 km s@xmath55 , while the metal - poor ( @xmath306  ) subcomponent has @xmath307 pc and velocity dispersion @xmath308 km s@xmath55 . for sculptor",
    "we find that a fraction @xmath309 of members belong to a metal - rich ( @xmath310  ) subcomponent with @xmath311 pc and velocity dispersion @xmath312 km s@xmath55 , while the remaining metal - poor ( @xmath313  ) subcomponent has @xmath314 pc and velocity dispersion @xmath315 km s@xmath55 .",
    "thus we recover the results of @xcite and @xcite , who show that the metal - rich inner subcomponents of sculptor and fornax have smaller velocity dispersions than the metal - poor outer subcomponents ( furthermore , the scale radii of @xmath316 pc and @xmath317 pc that @xcite derive for inner and outer scale radii , respectively , are broadly consistent with our measurements ) .",
    "the constraints on fornax s proper motion stand in excellent agreement with independent astrometric measurements made with hst @xcite .",
    "our measurement of sculptor s proper motion disagrees with astrometric measurements by @xcite and @xcite , which also disagree with each other .",
    "if either of the astrometric measurements is correct , then the velocity gradient that is present in sculptor may indicate a small rotational component @xcite .    for both galaxies the estimates of halflight radii and",

    "the right - most panel of figure [ fig:2mass_signif ] displays the corresponding posterior pdfs for @xmath5 for both fornax and sculptor .",
    "formally , we obtain @xmath321 for fornax and @xmath1 for sculptor .",
    "recall from section [ subsec : meaning ] that because we estimate masses at two finite points @xmath218 , the resulting slope @xmath213 corresponds to a region where the instantaneous slope @xmath211 is smaller than the central value of @xmath322 ( figure [ fig : prof_slope ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the amount by which it is smaller depends on the scale radius of the dark matter halo , a quantity that we do not attempt to constrain here . as a result ,",
    "a particular value of @xmath5 is strictly inconsistent only with central logarithmic density slopes @xmath209 that are _ larger _ than @xmath323 ( inequality [ eq : inequality2 ] ) .",
    "this means that measured values in the range @xmath324 are consistent with cores ( @xmath176 ; @xmath325 at all nonzero radii ) , but inconsistent with nfw and steeper cusps ( @xmath326 ) at all nonzero radii ) .    on these grounds we can use the posterior pdfs for @xmath5 , denoted @xmath327 , to calculate the significance , @xmath328 , with which our measurements exclude dark matter density profiles with central slopes equal to or steeper than a particular value of @xmath209 : @xmath329 our measurements exclude nfw and steeper cusps at @xmath330 ( fornax ) and @xmath331 ( sculptor ) significance levels . for several reasons we regard these formal exclusion levels as conservative .",
    "first , for the equilibrium dynamical systems that we consider as test cases in section [ sec : tests ] , our method tends to overestimate the mass of the inner subcomponent more strongly than it overestimates the mass of the outer subcomponent ( section [ subsubsec : masses ] ) , resulting in an underestimate of @xmath5 ( section [ subsubsec : slope ] ) .",
    "the only counter - examples to this trend that we find in our tests result from poorly resolved velocity dispersions ( sections [ subsubsec : masses ] - [ subsubsec : slope ] )",
    ". this resolution problem does not affect our results for fornax and sculptor , where even the smallest velocity dispersion that we measure ( @xmath312 for sculptor s inner subcomponent ) is several times larger than the median velocity error in the mmfs data set .",
    "second , by setting the lower limit of the integration in equation [ eq : significance ] at the value of the central slope @xmath212=2 $ ] , we extend maximum generosity to models with @xmath332 , which have instantaneous slopes @xmath333 at all nonzero radii ( section [ subsec : meaning ] and figure [ fig : prof_slope ] ) . at the radii ( @xmath334 ) where we evaluate @xmath5 for fornax and sculptor",
    ", the highest - resolution aquarius simulations predict that dsph - like cdm halos have @xmath335 , or equivalently , @xmath336 ( see figure 23 of @xcite ) .",
    "our measurements rule out these slopes with significance @xmath337 ( fornax ) and @xmath338 ( sculptor ) .",
    "third , we have assumed that the stellar subcomponents contribute negligibly to the gravitational potential .",
    "this assumption generally holds for dsphs , but least so for fornax , where the dynamical mass - to - light ratio is @xmath339 in solar units @xcite . if we attempt to remove the stellar contribution to the enclosed mass at each radius using the best - fit plummer profiles to both stellar subcomponents , we find that for any plausible stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath340_{\\odot}\\la 5 $ ] , our estimates of @xmath5 increase by a few percent ( because the stars contribute a larger fraction of mass to the inner than to the outer point ) , again exacerbating the discrepancy with halo models having @xmath332 . in summary , all systematic errors that we have identified",

    "let us review the assumptions that enter into our measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "in formulating our method we assume that a dsph consists of either one or two spherically symmetric , equilibrium stellar subcomponents that independently trace the same spherical dark matter potential . in order to quantify probability distributions for observed quantities",
    ", we further assume that both stellar subcomponents have plummer surface brightness profiles , gaussian mg - index distributions , and gaussian line - of - sight velocity distributions with constant dispersions that receive negligible contributions from ` non - thermal ' phenomena such as rotational support and/or binary - orbital motions .",
    "the tests described in section [ sec : tests ] indicate that for a range of models that explicitly violate our assumptions about plummer surface brightness and constant velocity dispersion profiles , our method tends to underestimate @xmath5 , implying that the stated nfw exclusion limits are conservative . here",
    "we discuss the potential for sensitivity to several assumptions inherent in our method that are _ not _ violated in the tests of section [ sec : tests ] but might be violated by real dsphs .",
    "fornax and sculptor both have projected minor - to - major axis ratios of @xmath400 @xcite and are among the roundest of the milky way s dsph satellites . in order to investigate the degree to which the observed flattening of fornax and sculptor might affect our measurements of @xmath5",
    ", we repeated our analysis using elliptical instead of circular radii , where a star s ` elliptical radius ' is the semi - major axis of the ellipse ( with center listed in table [ tab : mmfs ] , position angle and ellipticity listed in table 2 of @xcite ) that passes through the position of the star .",
    "use of elliptical instead of circular radii gives constraints of @xmath401 for fornax ( exclusion significance @xmath402 ) and @xmath403 for sculptor ( exclusion significance @xmath404 ) .",
    "thus the nfw exclusion level for fornax is relatively robust while the exclusion level for sculptor shows mild sensitivity to whether or not we adjust for sculptor s elliptical morphology .",
    "we measure @xmath5 by twice applying a mass estimator ( equation [ eq : walker ] ) derived from the spherical jeans equation ( equation [ eq : jeans ] ) , which holds for spherical systems in dynamic equilibrium .",
    "we must therefore consider the fact that nearby dsphs are vulnerable to disruptive tidal forces as they orbit within the potential of the milky way .",
    "tides can temporarily inflate dsph velocity dispersions  and thus dynamical masses  by ` heating ' the stellar component during a close pericentric passage and/or by stripping stars that , thence unbound , linger sufficiently near the dsph to be observed and counted as bound members ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both phenomena affect the outer more than the inner parts of a satellite  thus tidal heating is the only process we identify that may cause our method to return an _ over_-estimate of @xmath5 .",
    "however , measurements of their systemic distances and velocities imply that neither fornax ( @xmath405 kpc , @xcite ) nor sculptor ( @xmath406 kpc ) experience strong tidal encounters with the milky way .",
    "fornax s line - of - sight velocity and proper motion ( @xcite , supported by this work ) imply a pericenter distance of @xmath407 kpc ( @xcite , error bars give 95% confidence intervals ) , and sculptor s imply @xmath408 kpc ( with 95% confidence intervals allowing values as low as @xmath409 kpc ) for either of the two astrometric proper motion measurements @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations by @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that for satellite halos that follow the generic density profile given by equation [ eq : rho ] , the instantaneous tidal radius at pericenter is @xmath410^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath411 is the dsph mass enclosed within the tidal radius and @xmath412 is the enclosed mass of the milky way within the pericentric distance . @xcite have recently used a sample of tracers ( halo stars , globular clusters and satellite galaxies ) in the outer galactic halo to estimate a mass of @xmath413 .",
    "we obtain conservative lower limits for the pericentric tidal radii of fornax and sculptor by considering only the _ stellar _ mass of each dsph ( dynamical masses are @xmath414 times larger , @xcite ) and taking @xmath415 as an upper limit for the mass enclosed within the pericentric radius of each satellite : @xmath416^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath417 is the stellar mass - to - light ratio . using the pericentric distances quoted above , the luminosities listed in table [ tab : mmfs ] and assuming @xmath418 , we obtain @xmath419 kpc for fornax and @xmath420 pc for sculptor .",
    "these lower limits are larger than the halflight radii that we measure for the outer subcomponents of both galaxies .",
    "nearly all member stars lie inside these radii and thus  particularly if both galaxies additionally have dark matter halos  we can expect that tides do not profoundly alter the structure and kinematics of fornax and sculptor during their pericentric passages .",
    "even if fornax and sculptor have orbital pericenters much smaller than indicated by their measured proper motions , both systems are now sufficiently far from the milky way that they will have reached new equilibrium configurations and shed any stripped stars .",
    "that unbound tidal debris lingers near a tidally stripped satellite only for a time similar to the satellite s internal crossing time , which for the milky way s ` classical ' dsphs is @xmath421 myr , or the amount of time required to travel @xmath422 kpc at constant speed @xmath423 km s@xmath55 .",
    "this duration is much smaller than the amount of time required by either fornax or sculptor to travel to their present locations from pericentric distances compatible with significant tidal disruption .",
    "mass estimates for stellar subcomponents identified by our method are directly proportional to the corresponding estimates of stellar velocity dispersions . in principle , any contribution to these velocity dispersions by ` non - thermal ' motions such as rotational support or unresolved binary orbital motions ( next section ) might introduce a bias in our mass estimates beyond those that we have already identified in section [ subsubsec : masses ] .    a stellar subcomponent that receives significant support against gravity from rotation about an axis not aligned with the line of sight will exhibit a smooth variation in mean velocity as a function of position . for the simplest ( solid body )",
    "rotation models , rotation introduces a gradient in mean line - of - sight velocity .",
    "all three of the dsphs studied here exhibit statistically significant gradients in their velocities as measured in the heliocentric and milky way rest frames @xcite . however",
    ", our method attributes any such gradient not to rotation ( which we implicitly assume is insignificant ) , but wholly to the perspective effect induced by the dsph s systemic motion transverse to the line of sight ( section [ subsec : veldist ] ) .",
    "since we account for this effect in our likelihood function , our method effectively removes the contribution of any apparent velocity gradient from our estimates of the subcomponent velocity dispersions",
    ".    one might object that such gradients can arise due to a combination of perspective effects _ and _ rotation , and that by attributing any detected gradients entirely to perspective effects , we unduly ignore what might be real and dynamically significant rotation .",
    "this concern is particularly relevant for sculptor , where the proper motion that we estimate disagrees with both published astrometric measurements @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the gradients in question are sufficiently small that our estimates of @xmath5 are insensitive to our assumptions about the relative importance of rotation and perspective effects .",
    "if we assume that fornax and sculptor have zero proper motion in the heliocentric rest frame , such that any velocity gradient is allowed to contribute maximally to our velocity dispersion estimates , then we estimate @xmath424 for fornax and @xmath425 for sculptor ; both values are statistically indistinguishable from our original constraints .",
    "it has long been recognized that dsph mass estimates derived from stellar velocity dispersions may be vulnerable to the inflation of those dispersions by stellar binary orbital motions . @xcite and @xcite independently demonstrate that unless dsphs have binary orbital distributions that are pathologically different from those observed among field stars , binary motions do not contribute significantly to the velocity dispersions of @xmath426 km s@xmath55 measured from red giants in ` classical ' dsphs .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite have recently shown that binaries may contribute significantly to ( and in some cases dominate ) the velocity dispersions of @xmath427 km s@xmath55 that have been measured from fainter stars in some of the least luminous milky way satellites ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of @xcite show that susceptibility to inflation by binary motions increases as the measured velocity dispersion decreases  i.e .",
    ", for smaller dispersions it becomes more likely that binary motions contribute significantly to the signal . according to these simulations ( and independent simulations by @xcite ) it is highly unlikely that binary motions contribute significantly to the velocity dispersions we estimate in this study , since the smallest dispersion we estimate is @xmath428 km s@xmath55 ( for sculptor s inner subcomponent ) .",
    "furthermore , even if binary motions are significant in our sample , they would contribute more significantly to the smaller dispersions that we measure for the inner subcomponents of fornax and sculptor than they do to the larger dispersions that we measure for outer subcomponents .",
    "thus binaries would affect our measurement of the slope @xmath5 in the same sense as the bias that is already inherent in our mass estimator ( section [ subsubsec : masses ] ) , causing us to overestimate the mass of the inner component to a larger degree than we overestimate the mass of the outer component .",
    "therefore , to the extent that binary motions are relevant at all , they join the other sources of error that cause us to underestimate @xmath5 systematically , again implying that our formal exclusion levels are conservative .",
    "our method allows for up to two stellar subcomponents .",
    "deep photometric surveys suggest that sculptor probably has exactly two stellar subcomponents that are sufficiently bright to observe in large numbers ( sculptor also has extremely metal - poor stars similar to those found in the faintest dsphs @xcite , which may correspond to a third , ` ultrafaint ' subcomponent ) , as indicated by the different spatial distributions of its blue- and red - horizontal - branch stars @xcite .",
    "fornax exhibits the same sort of bimodal horizontal branch morphology , but while sculptor stopped forming stars as long as @xmath426 gyr ago , fornax has a young main sequence population with age of order @xmath429 myr @xcite .",
    "the young main sequence stars are more centrally concentrated than either of the subcomponents traced by evolved giants , so fornax appears to have at least three distinct stellar subcomponents @xcite . while the presence of three subcomponents offers the possibility of measuring the slope of fornax s mass profile using three resolved points , it is unlikely that our spectroscopic sample of stars selected from fornax s red giant branch includes a significant number from the young and relatively unevolved population .",
    "finally , we note that the local group hosts several more dsphs for which similar measurements are feasible in the short term .",
    "although its large angular size presents observational challenges , there is already spectroscopic evidence that the sextans dsph contains chemo - dynamically distinct stellar subcomponents @xcite .",
    "furthermore , star formation histories measured by comparing observed and synthetic color magnitude diagrams indicate that the milky way dsphs draco , leo i , leo ii and ursa minor all have intermediate ( @xmath430 ) as well as old ( @xmath431 gyr ) stellar populations @xcite .",
    "@xcite identify spatially segregated blue- and red - horizontal branch populations in andromeda satellites and i and and vi , and @xcite find similar photometric evidence for distinct stellar subcomponents in and ii . the ability to separate these objects statistically into chemo - dynamically distinct stellar subcomponents",
    "will depend on a combination of spectroscopic sample size and the individual properties of the dsphs , particularly regarding the inherent contrast between stellar subcomponents .",
    "a large and comprehensive survey of dsphs that are separable into stellar subcomponents will help to evaluate the generality of our results for fornax and sculptor .",
    "we have introduced a method for measuring the slopes of mass profiles for dsphs that have chemo - dynamically distinct stellar subcomponents .",
    "the method operates directly on spectroscopic data and invokes neither a dark matter halo model nor any assumption about velocity anisotropy .",
    "rather , it exploits the basic principle that two resolved points in the same profile are sufficient to define a slope .",
    "given measurements of stellar positions , velocities and spectral indices , our method can measure halflight radii and velocity dispersions simultaneously for up to two stellar subcomponents in the same dsph . for any mass estimator of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is some constant , these measurements immediately provide an estimate of the slope @xmath282 as defined by two points .    applying our method to published magellan / mmfs data ,",
    "we distinguish two stellar subcomponents each in the fornax and sculptor dsphs , for which we measure @xmath321 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with cored dark matter halos of constant density over the central few hundred parsecs and rule out nfw - like ( @xmath2 ) cusps with significance @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "tests with synthetic data drawn from physical distribution functions demonstrate that these exclusion levels are conservative .",
