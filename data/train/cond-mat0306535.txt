    "spatial disorder is a generic feature of pattern formation . whereas the simplest patterns that appear in numbers of physical or chemical systems driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium are periodic structures ( such as stripes , squares or hexagons ) , in practice , many steady patterns observed in spatially extended systems are more complex and disordered at large scale @xcite .",
    "why disordered configurations spontaneously form ( without the help of impurities or any quenched disorder ) and do not asymptotically evolve with time toward more ordered states is still not fully understood .",
    "for instance , systems where various ( say , two ) patterns of different symmetries coexist can easily lead to disordered states . a basic example is rayleigh - bnard convection of non - boussinesq fluids , where hexagonal patterns bifurcate subcritically and are stable along with the uniform conductive state within a whole interval of rayleigh numbers . in bistability regions , asymptotic configurations may be either homogeneous ( containing a single phase ) or heterogeneous , with both phases present and distributed in a non - regular way .",
    "heterogeneous states have been identified experimentally in rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite , vibrated granular materials @xcite , or turing patterns and related gas - discharge systems @xcite .",
    "spatial disorder has been also proposed as a generic feature of pattern formation in ecosystems , as illustrated by vegetation patches in arid regions @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the usual nonlinear model equations for periodic patterns often predict metastable disordered states as well .",
    "regarding bistable / subcritical patterns , a lot of attention has been devoted in the past years to localized structures , that are axisymmetric isolated structures of well - defined shape and size immersed in a uniform quiescent background ( of vanishing order parameter ) @xcite .",
    "localized structures have been identified as a possible origin of disorder in bistable systems , as asymptotic steady states are in some case composed of many localized structures randomly distributed in space @xcite .",
    "the stability of these spatially chaotic \" states , as opposed to periodic , can be explained by the particular nature of the effective pair interaction between two localized structures @xcite .    in the present paper , we consider the swift - hohenberg model for hexagonal patterns in the bistability zone mentioned above and study spatially more extended objects , namely , islands with hexagonal order surrounded by the quiescent background .",
    "a localized structure can be seen as a limiting case where such an domain is of very small size ( of order @xmath0 , the wavelength of the base pattern ) .",
    "an interesting question to ask is up to what point localized structures and large islands differ from each other , although they probably share closely related features .",
    "we therefore analyze in the following the dynamics of a planar interface separating an extended domain of hexagons and a uniform phase in the bistability region .",
    "although interfaces have been relatively less studied than localized structures in this context @xcite , we show that they play a central role in the large time evolution of two - dimensional extended systems , and in the formation of heterogeneous disordered states .    after recalling a few known results on the weakly nonlinear regime ( section [ recall ] ) , we show that in the nonlinear regime interfaces can either move ( with two modes : expanding or shrinking domains ) , or be pinned , depending on the value of the main control parameter ( section [ ampeq ] ) .",
    "the theoretical treatment is based on an extension of the usual amplitude equation formalism to include non - adiabatic `` effects , according to some ideas presented in @xcite .",
    "some analogies of this system with interfaces in solid crystals are pointed out .",
    "the results are further confronted with numerical resolution of the swift - hohenberg equation in section [ numerical ] , where a dynamical diagram for interfaces is drawn in parameter space . in section [ disorder ] , we discuss the stability of heterogeneous frozen states .",
    "we show that the stability region of localized structures only partially overlap the pinning regime of interfaces .",
    "we deduce that the existence of steady disordered configurations ( and therefore of localized structures of infinite life - time ) is possible in practice only in that pinning regime .",
    "disordered frozen configurations obtained from random initial conditions can be of various types : they can contain localized structures , or localized structures and extended domains of hexagons ( mixed '' disorder ) , or extended domains and no localized structures .",
    "changing the control parameters can drive the system outside of the pinning zone , keeping localized structures stable : these are absorbed by growing domains and therefore become metastable .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a system described by a dimensionless local order parameter @xmath1 , representing , for example , the mid - plane vertical velocity in convection problems .",
    "the spatio - temporal evolution of @xmath2 in non - boussinesq convection can be described by a generalized swift - hohenberg equation @xcite , @xmath3 the parameter @xmath4 is the main control parameter and represents the reduced rayleigh number @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the critical rayleigh number .",

    "( plotted below in fig.[fig : pth ] as a function of @xmath14 ) is proportional to the difference of free - energy density @xmath55 between the regular hexagonal state and the uniform state .",
    "therefore , the sign of @xmath43 is such that the domain with the lower free - energy expands at the expense of the other . from eq.([v0 ] ) , @xmath10 being fixed , the velocity changes sign at @xmath56 , a value located in the coexistence region .",
    "the uniform phase spreads if @xmath57 , whereas the hexagonal phase does in the much wider interval @xmath58 .",
    "the interface is stationary only at @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , except at the marginal value @xmath60 , the amplitude equation formalism at leading order predicts that spatially heterogeneous distributions of hexagonal and conductive regions should eventually evolve toward a single state , either hexagonal or conductive , through interface motion .",

    "domains can contain dislocations in the bulk , and even vacancies .",

    "the quantity @xmath161 can be seen as a measure of the pattern strength `` , a weak '' pattern yielding the phase @xmath21 .",

    "note that one must eliminate among the eligible products those that are resonant in any of the leading order amplitude equations ( [ amp10])-([amp30 ] ) or their complex conjugates .",
    "these resonant terms , added to similar ones coming from the linear operator @xmath207 in ( [ solvc ] ) , constitute one of the 6 standard amplitude equations : the sum of these terms cancels out at order @xmath208 ( the order of the terms in the brackets of eq.([solvc ] ) ) , and thus would contribute in non - adiabatic effects at the following order , not considered here . for example , in deriving the nonadiabatic contributions of the equation for @xmath209 , one finds an eligible term ( [ i ] ) involving a product @xmath210 , characterized by @xmath211 . but this term is resonant in the equation for @xmath212 , and hence needs to be discarded",
