    "the hard x - ray spectra of galactic black holes ( gbh ) and radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are generally thought to form through thermal comptonisation process , i.e. , multiple up  scattering of soft seed photons in a hot plasma .",
    "this process indeed , leads generally to a power law hard x - ray spectrum with a nearly exponential cut - off at an energy characteristic of the plasma temperature .",
    "the spectral slope depends both on the temperature @xmath2 and the thomson optical depth of the plasma @xmath3 .",
    "the spectra are generally harder when both @xmath3 and @xmath2 are larger ( e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) .",
    "spectral fits indicate @xmath4  kev and @xmath5 ( see reviews by zdziarski et al .",
    "1997 , poutanen 1998 ) .",
    "the nature of the comptonising plasma is still unclear",
    ". this could be the hot inner part of the accretion disc powered by viscous dissipation ( e.g. shapiro , lightman & eardley 1976 ) .",
    "another possibility would be a patchy corona lying atop an accretion disc and powered by magnetic reconnection ( e.g. bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ; haard , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "see beloborodov 1999b ( b99b ) for a recent review . in both cases",
    "the main dominant cooling mechanism of the hot plasma is compton cooling .",
    "the soft cooling photons may be generated internally ( e.g. by cyclo / synchrotron processes , see however wardzinski & zdziarski 1999 ) , or more likely be produced by a cold medium in the vicinity of the hot plasma .",
    "in addition the spectra exhibit reflection features , in particular , the compton bump and the fluorescent iron line which are the signatures for the presence of cold matter which reflects the primary hard radiation ( george & fabian 1991 ; nandra & pound 1994 ) .",
    "this cold matter could take the form of standard accretion disc or be constituted of cold clouds in the vicinity the hot source .",
    "a correlation between the amplitude of the reflection component , @xmath1 , and the photon index , @xmath0 , is observed both in sample of sources and in the evolution of individual sources .",
    "this correlation is reported both in agn and gbh ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 , hereafter zls99 ; gilfanov , churazov & revnitsev 2000 , hereafter gcr00 ) .",
    "the existence of a correlation strongly support models where the cooling of the plasma is due to thermal radiation from the same medium that produces the reflection component ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ; zls99 ) .",
    "it is an evidence against models where the soft photons are generated internally and independently of the reflection component .",
    "it is also an evidence against models where most of the reflection is produced very far from the hot source ( e.g. on a torus ; ghisellini , haardt & matt 1994 ; krolik , madau & ycki 1994 ) .",
    "it could also be an argument against the patchy corona scenario which , in its simplest version , produces an anti - correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( e.g. malzac , beloborodov & poutanen 2001 , hereafter mbp ) .",
    "however , the energetics of the source may be strongly modified by mildly relativistic bulk motions in the corona ( beloborodov 1999a ) .",
    "the effects of bulk motion enable to reproduce both individual spectra and the observed @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation in agn as well as in gbh ( b99b ; mbp ) .",
    "the alternative model is a hot quasi - spherical plasma , surrounded by a cold accretion disc which can overlap with the hot inner region ( e.g. poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ) .",
    "this latter model seems to fit well the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation observed in galactic sources ( gcr00 , see however beloborodov 2001 ) .    in the case of seyfert galaxies the measured @xmath1 values",
    "should be taken with caution since they may be affected by the larger uncertainties in the spectrum measurement .",
    "it is however striking that the hot - sphere plus cold - disc model can not account for the whole range of observed @xmath1 in seyfert galaxies ( zls99 ) .",
    "in particular , since the outer disc is always present , very low reflection coefficients ( @xmath6 ) , observed in many sources , can not be produced ( unless the disc is strongly ionized ) . due to the low covering fraction of the cold material , large observed reflection amplitudes ( @xmath7 )",
    "can not be reached .",
    "a simple geometry for the cold material that may produce both large and very low covering fraction is a spherical geometry where cold clouds are distributed spherically , around the central hot plasma .",
    "the possibility for the existence of cold clouds in the innermost part of the accretion flow was suggested by guilbert & rees 1988 .",
    "it has been further studied in details and shown to be physically realisable ( celotti , fabian & rees 1992 ; kuncic , blackman & rees 1996 ; kuncic , celotti & rees 1997 ) .",
    "the particular spherical geometry considered here was proposed by collin - souffrin et al .",
    "different variations on this model have been further studied , in the context of multi wavelength variability and line formation .",
    "it has been shown to present a range of advantages regarding to the observations ( e.g. czerny & dumont 1998 ; abrassart & czerny 2000 , hereafter ac00 ; collin et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in all these studies the authors focussed on the cold blobs themselves and not on the problem of energy balance in the hot phase .",
    "the influence of the cold matter distribution on the primary emission was not considered . indeed , a fraction of the cold clouds thermal radiation enters the central hot region .",
    "the heating of the hot plasma is thus balanced by the compton cooling due to the incoming soft photon flux .",
    "the resulting equilibrium temperature @xmath2 , ( and thus the emitted the spectrum ) then depends mainly on the cloud distribution .    here",
    "we will show that taking into account these latter effects enable to reproduce the range of observed @xmath1 and @xmath0 as well as the correlation that is observed seyfert galaxies .",
    "with some additional assumptions , the distribution of @xmath1 , and @xmath0 as well as the uv to x - ray flux ratios , may be explained by darkening effects .    in section  [ sec : estimates ] , we present our assumptions and provide analytical estimates for @xmath1 and @xmath0 as predicted by the spherical accretion model .",
    "then , we will use these estimates to constrain the model with observations . in section  [ sec : closeclouds ] , we consider the case where the clouds thermal emission is due only to reprocessing of the hard x - ray radiation . in section  [ sec : remoteclouds ] , we study the effects of an eventual additional internal energy dissipation process in the clouds .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : consideration ] , we comment on several observational issues .",
    "for the purpose of computing the spectral characteristics , the exact nature of the cold clouds does not need to be specified .",
    "they could consist in radially infalling material as well as the residual fragments from the inner part of a disrupted disc orbiting around the central object .",
    "we require the accretion flow to be spheric only in its inner parts .",
    "this does not preclude the existence of an outer accretion disc .",
    "the clouds are even not required to be accreting and they could be part of an outflow or a wind .",
    "they are however powered by accretion through reprocessing of the primary hard x - ray radiation .    as long as the number of clouds is large enough the observed spectrum",
    "does not depend much on the particular cloud distribution or line of sight .",
    "rather , it depends on general intrinsic characteristics of the source such as the cloud covering fraction and the average relative distance between the clouds and the hot comptonising plasma .",
    "the shape of the individual clouds is then indifferent .",
    "let us consider that the hot phase constitutes a sphere with radius @xmath8 .",
    "we note @xmath9 , the power dissipated inside this hot sphere .",
    "we assume that the cold clouds are all at the same distance @xmath10 from the centre of the sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) .",
    "we model their effects by assuming that a fraction @xmath11 of the radiation impinging on the sphere of radius @xmath10 is intercepted .",
    "@xmath11 is thus the covering fraction of the clouds .",
    "a fraction @xmath12 of the intercepted flux is reflected while the rest is absorbed , reprocessed and reemitted as soft ( uv ) radiation .",
    "@xmath12 is the energy and angle integrated hard x - ray albedo .    for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that all the _ reprocessed _ power is emitted by the _",
    "clouds surface , i.e. _ toward the inner part of the accretion flow_. this assumption is reasonable if the clouds are compton thick and highly absorbing and thermal conductivity can be neglected .",
    "then , most of the impinging energy is absorbed close to the inner surface and reemited locally .",
    "in addition to reprocessed emission it is possible that the clouds radiate due to some additional internal dissipation process ( see section  [ sec : remoteclouds ] ) . we will allow for this possibility .",
    "we note @xmath13 the total power dissipated in the cold clouds and radiated as uv radiation .",
    "half of it is emitted outward , the other half is emitted toward the hot plasma .",
    "the virtual sphere of radius @xmath10 receives a total power @xmath14 .",
    "it arises from three contributions : @xmath15 respectively the comptonised luminosity , the reflected luminosity , the soft luminosity .",
    "a fraction @xmath16 is intercepted by the reflector and then reprocessed / reflected toward the inner direction .",
    "an important quantity is the fraction of luminosity emitted inwardly by the reflector surface which is not comptonised ( i.e. emitted toward the reflector without interacting with the hot plasma ) : @xmath17 @xmath3 is the hot plasma thomson optical depth , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the solid angle subtended by the hot source as seen from the surface of the reflector . in our spherical approximation",
    ", we have : @xmath20    in reality , one expects to have clouds radially distributed around the source , rather than at a given distance .",
    "actually quantities such as @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 should be regarded as _ average quantities _ , indicative of the characteristic distance where most of the reprocessing takes place .",
    "we expect that for most of possible radial distributions one can find an effective @xmath21 that provides a reasonable approximation to the high energy spectrum",
    ". the only important effect of a very extended radial distribution would be that a significant fraction of the radiation reprocessed by the outer clouds , rather than feeding the hot phase , escapes trough reflection on the dark side of the innermost clouds .",
    "taking into account this effect would require to introduce a transmission factor for reprocessed radiation which would depend on the specific cloud distribution . in order to limit the number of model parameters and for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will not consider this possibility .      in the next sections we will link the intrinsic physical and geometric properties of the source to observable quantities .",
    "similar estimates for the luminosity ratios and the amplification factor can be found in a different form in ac00 .",
    "we extend their results to the case where some dissipation occurs in the cold phase .",
    "but the main improvement brought by the present work is to provide estimates for the two measured quantities that are commonly used to describe the hard x - ray spectra , namely the spectral slope @xmath0 and the reflection coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "these spectral characteristics are fully determined by 6 parameters : the covering factor @xmath11 , the relative cloud distance @xmath21 , the relative dissipation in the clouds @xmath24 , the hot plasma scattering optical depth @xmath3 and the cloud albedo @xmath12 and the characteristic energy of the soft seed photons , which may be quantified using an effective blackbody temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the albedo depends mainly on the ionization state of matter and also on the shape of the incident spectrum . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the cold matter in the clouds is neutral .",
    "the characteristic values of the albedo for typical comptonisation spectra in agn is then @xmath26 ( see mbp ) .",
    "our results are insensitive to its actual value as long as it is low ( @xmath27 .",
    "since this condition is always realized for neutral matter we will fix @xmath12@xmath280.1 without considering any dependence on the spectral parameters . on the other hand",
    ", there is a complication due to our particular geometry which make possible multiple reflections inside the spherical cavity .",
    "the neutral albedo for a reflection - like spectrum differs significantly from that for the primary comptonisation spectrum .",
    "we will thus consider a different albedo , noted @xmath29 , for the reflected luminosity .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation , considering a typical reflection spectrum incident on neutral matter , provided the value @xmath30 used below .",
    "precise estimates of @xmath3 from spectral analysis are quite model dependent . in the same object",
    "one can infer @xmath3 being as low as a few tenth , and up to a few , depending on the fitting model ( petrucci et al .",
    "2000 ) and may differ from source to source .",
    "however the 2 - 10 kev spectral slope @xmath0 depends only weakly on @xmath3 ( see section  [ sec : spectralslo ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : ampli ] ) .",
    "the main effect of @xmath3 is on the reflection amplitude @xmath1 due to the destruction of the reflection component crossing the hot phase ( mbp ) .",
    "this effect is important only when the clouds are extremely close to the source ( i.e. @xmath31 ; see section  [ sec : rdec ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdec ] ) . since",
    ", @xmath3 is generally found to be of order unity , we will fix the optical depth to the standard value @xmath3=1 .    the value of the effective blackbody temperature",
    ", @xmath25 affects @xmath0 ( and also slightly @xmath12 ) .",
    "changes in @xmath32 have however almost no effects , as long as they are kept inside the observed range where the bulk of the soft luminosity emerges in agn ( 5 - 50 ev ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : ampli ] ) .",
    "we will thus assume that @xmath25 lies somewhere in that range .",
    "the number of effective parameters is thus reduced to 3 , namely : @xmath21 , @xmath11 and @xmath33 .      the reflected luminosity @xmath34 impinging on the sphere of radius @xmath10 has been emitted by the reflector itself from a fraction of the impinging x ray luminosity and crossed the system without being compton scattered , we can thus write : @xmath35 the additional @xmath36 term on the right hand side of equation  [ eq : lr ] accounts for multiple reflections in the cloud system .",
    "the amplitude of reflection @xmath1 is usually defined by the ratio of an observed reflection component to that expected from an isotropic point source with the same luminosity illuminating an infinite slab : @xmath37 in our case the latter can be estimated as : @xmath38    indeed , in the disc illumination framework , half of the hard x - ray luminosity is emitted toward the disc , of which a fraction @xmath12 is then reflected .",
    "the angle @xmath39 is the assumed inclination of the slab .",
    "the factor @xmath40 represents the angular dependence of reflection in the reference slab model .",
    "we estimate the @xmath41 function using the approximation given by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) : @xmath42.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is then straightforward to relate the observable @xmath1 to the physical parameters of the spherical model : @xmath43    usually @xmath39 is a frozen parameter of the fitting model enabling to measure @xmath1 from comparison to the slab reflection model ( cf pexrav model in xspec , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) . in sections  [ sec : closeclouds ] and [ sec :",
    "remoteclouds ] , we will compare the model predictions with the the observational @xmath1 values given by zls99 .",
    "these data have been fitted with @xmath39@xmath28@xmath44 .",
    "we will thus adopt this value in most of our numerical estimates .",

    "the total soft luminosity emitted by the reflector is thus @xmath50 .",
    "the soft luminosity entering the hot phase is then : @xmath51 the total luminosity escaping from the hot phase is the sum of the power dissipated internally and the total power received from the cold phase : @xmath52 then using equation  [ eq : globalenergybalance ] , it is straightforward to show that @xmath53 finally , combining equation  [ eq : lhot ] with [ eq : luv ] and [ eq : ls ] , we derive an estimate for the amplification factor : @xmath54}{\\xi c(\\omega - a)l_{h}+\\xi(\\omega - ac)l_{\\rm d}/2}. \\label{eq : spherampl}\\ ] ]      a commonly measured quantity is the photon index @xmath0 .",
    "it represents the spectral slope of the _ intrinsic _ comptonisation power law spectrum ( i.e. not including reflection ) .",
    "it is generally measured in the energy range 210 kev for a flux given in units of photon per energy ( e.g. photon kev@xmath55  @xmath56  s@xmath55 ) .",
    "the amplification factor is directly related to the photon index .",
    "the @xmath0 versus @xmath57 relation may be derived from numerical simulations .",
    "we use the monte - carlo code of malzac & jourdain ( 2000 ) based on the non - linear method proposed by stern et al .",
    "we consider a sphere of thermal plasma with optical depth @xmath3 defined along its radius .",
    "the sphere is homogeneously heated with a power @xmath9 .",
    "soft photons are _ externally _ injected at the sphere surface with a black body spectrum of temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the injected soft luminosity is @xmath58 .",
    "the density is homogeneous inside the sphere .",
    "it is however divided in 10 radial zones in order to account for temperature gradients . for a fixed ratio @xmath59=@xmath57-@xmath60",
    ", the code computes the equilibrium temperature structure as well as the spectrum of escaping radiation .",
    "we then use a least - square fit to the 2 - 10 kev spectrum to determine the photon index @xmath0 .",
    "simulations were performed for several values of @xmath57-@xmath60 in the range 11000 , for @xmath25@xmath28 5 and 50 ev , @xmath3@xmath280.2 and 1 .",
    "we then discarded simulations resulting in a volume averaged electron temperature larger than 400 kev , i.e. larger than what is inferred from the observations of the high energy cut - off .",
    "we also discarded simulations resulting in @xmath0 outside of the range of interest regarding to the observations ( 1.42.2 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ampli ] , this sample of numerical results can be represented by the functional shape proposed by b99b : @xmath61 with @xmath62=@xmath63 and @xmath64=@xmath65 .",
    "the largest error is about 7 per cent , arising for @xmath25@xmath2850 ev , @xmath59@xmath286 and @xmath3@xmath280.2 ( @xmath2@xmath28360 kev ) . if one except this high temperature case the error is less than 5 per cent .",
    "we conclude that , at least for @xmath3 in the range 0.21 , and all the other parameters being in the observed range , @xmath0 depends ( almost ) only on the amplification factor . this dependence can be represented with a good accuracy by equation  [ eq : total ] .",
    "the value of the coefficient differs slightly from those originally given by b99b ( @xmath62@xmath282.33 , @xmath64@xmath28@xmath66 ) .",
    "the reasons for these small differences could be that we performed a detailed radiative transfer for the sphere geometry , while beloborodov s results are based on a simple escape probability formalism in a one zone approximation ( coppi 1992 ) , and photons injected at the centre .",
    "another possible cause for the discrepancy , is that we fitted numerical results allowing temperature to adjust while temperature was fixed in the calculations of b99b and @xmath3 was varied according to the amplification .",
    "relation  [ eq : total ] , used together with equation  [ eq : spherampl ] relates the observable @xmath0 to the model parameters .",
    "the observed uv to x - ray flux ratio can be estimated as follow : @xmath67 then , using equations  [ eq : luv1 ] and [ eq : luv ] , one can link the luminosity ratio to the model parameters :    @xmath68l_{\\rm d}/2 } { \\omega\\left[(1-kc)l_{\\rm h } + ( 1-k)l_{\\rm d}/2\\right ] } \\label{eq : fuvsfx}.\\ ] ]    when comparing to observations one should keep in mind that this relation gives actually only a lower limit on the observed uv to x - ray flux .",
    "indeed , there may be other sources of uv radiation in real objects ( like an external accretion disc ) .",
    "in this section , we will assume no dissipation in the blobs ( @xmath13=0 ) .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdec ] show @xmath1 ( left panel ) and @xmath0 ( right panel ) as function of @xmath11 for different ratios @xmath21 .",
    "the reflection amplitude grows almost linearly with @xmath11 , starting from @xmath1@xmath280 where there is no reflector ( @xmath11=0 ) , and reaching values of order @xmath69 for fully obscured source ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "indeed , as seen from the source , the reflector then covers a solid angle @xmath71 .",
    "as the observed reflection component is produced on the inner side of the clouds , a fraction of the reflected photons may be compton scattered in the hot plasma before escaping to the observer .",
    "the net effect is to decrease the apparent amount of reflection in the observed spectrum ( see mbp ) .",
    "this compton smearing effect is obviously stronger at low @xmath21 , when the hot source subtends a larger solid angle .",
    "the maximum @xmath1 value is then lower , as shown on left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdec ] .",
    "this maximum value depends on the plasma optical depth @xmath3 . for an optically thin plasma",
    "there is no significant reduction of @xmath1 , while for very thick plasma and very close clouds ( @xmath72 ) the reflection component can be almost totally destroyed .    on the other hand at large @xmath21 ( @xmath73 ) , this effect can be neglected . for large covering factors , multiple reflections on the inner side of the clouds",
    "tend to increase @xmath1 up to values larger than 2 . in this limit of @xmath21 larger than a few ,",
    "the shape of the relation @xmath1 vs @xmath11 becomes fully independent of @xmath21 .    in any case , for reasonable optical depths , the range of achievable @xmath1 when @xmath11 varies from 0 to 1",
    ", is comparable to the range of observed @xmath1 ( from 0 up to a few ) .      for very low covering factors ( @xmath74 ) the amplification factor is huge and the spectrum is thus very hard .",
    "it softens very quickly with increasing @xmath11 . at @xmath75 the growth rate decreases and",
    "@xmath0 then evolves slowly and almost linearly .",
    "the spectral slope softens by @xmath76 between @xmath11=0.1 and @xmath11=0.8 .",
    "then , for higher covering factors , the soft radiation emitted by the clouds remain trapped inside the reflector sphere .",
    "this effect is non linear , a small increase in @xmath11 then increases dramatically the amount of soft cooling radiation @xmath58 entering the hot plasma . as a consequence the emitted spectrum softens",
    "very quickly and @xmath0 diverges again for @xmath70 .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath21 does not change significantly the global shape described above . increasing @xmath21 simply shift the curve downward .",
    "indeed , the feedback from the clouds decreases , as they are more distant , and the spectra are harder on average .    for clouds distances in the range @xmath8@xmath77@xmath10@xmath77@xmath78",
    "the plateau of the curve falls in the range @xmath79 .",
    "the observed range of @xmath0 values is then produced with intermediate @xmath11 values ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "as both @xmath1 and @xmath0 increase with @xmath11 , it is obvious that changes in the covering factor will produce a correlation between these two spectral parameters .",
    "it is then interesting to compare this correlation with the observed one .",
    "the solid lines in fig .  [ fig : spher_ldproptoc ] show the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation obtained when varying the covering factor of the source .",
    "the data points ( from zls99 ) are also plotted in this figure .",
    "the different curves are for different fixed values of the distance @xmath10 from the centre . clearly , the overall shape of the correlation is well reproduced as long as the reflector is closer than 3 times the size of the x - ray source .",
    "most of the data points lie in this range .",
    "this range of distances could be the dispersion of the average distance of the reprocessor in different sources .",
    "it is also probable that most of the apparent spread is simply due to errors in the measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "if the reflector is located at distance larger than @xmath81 the feedback from reprocessing becomes too low and this produces very hard spectra .",
    "the distance is thus strongly constrained to be below @xmath82 . if some dissipation occurs , however , a wider range of distances is allowed , see section  [ sec : remoteclouds ] .",
    "the prediction of a correlation , as well as its general shape , are insensitive to our model assumptions .",
    "the system formed by equation  [ eq : spherr ] , [ eq : spherampl ] and [ eq : total ] , giving @xmath1 and @xmath0 as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath11 is , in general , invertible analytically .",
    "it is thus possible to transpose the @xmath1-@xmath0 data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spher_ldproptoc ] into the @xmath21-@xmath11 plane .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",

    "several data points of our sample fall into this unphysical case .",
    "the probable reason is that the reflection component was too weak to be detected .",

    "concerning @xmath89 , at larger @xmath10 , the average @xmath0 is harder , and the distribution is slightly narrower .    unlike the @xmath11-distribution , the theoretical @xmath0 distribution depends somewhat on the exact relation between @xmath0 and the amplification factor @xmath57 .",
    "different approximations used to represent this exact relation may give different results .",

    "the shape of the distribution is still in qualitative agreement with the data .",
    "we conclude that the spread in @xmath21 is actually negligible and the @xmath11-distribution plays a major role for the observed @xmath1 and @xmath0 distributions . simply by setting the only significant parameters ( namely @xmath21 ) to a value relatively close to 1.7",
    ", the model qualitatively reproduces three observational pieces of information that we have on the sources : the correlation @xmath1-@xmath0 , and the respective distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .      using equation  [ eq : fuvsfx ]",
    ", one can derive the distribution of the @xmath92 that is predicted by the model with the @xmath11-distribution given by equation  [ eq : pdec1 ] .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : luvtolx ] shows the theoretical distribution which is compared with the observed one ( data from walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "this kind of comparisons should be taken with caution , since the expression for @xmath92 given by equation  [ eq : fuvsfx ] refers to _ integrated quantities _ while the measurements of walter & fink were performed at a fixed uv and x - ray wavelengths ( respectively 1375  and 2 kev ) . moreover , as shown by kuncic et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , small clouds probably emit in the euv , rather than in the uv .    despite these uncertainties , fig .  [",
    "fig : luvtolx ] clearly shows that the modeled and observed distributions do not match . for @xmath92 larger than a few ,",
    "the model probability density is very close to 0 .",
    "in contrast , the observed distribution extends up to quite large large uv to x flux ratios ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "clearly , the inner clouds do not emit enough uv radiation to reach the highest observed uv to x luminosity ratios .",
    "note that , in principle , the model can produce arbitrarily large @xmath92 ( see equation  [ eq : fuvsfx ] ) , by setting @xmath11 and @xmath23 close to unity .",
    "the problem is that it produces a too small amount of large @xmath92 sources .",
    "fitting the observed @xmath92 distribution would require a distribution of covering factor which would be a growing function of @xmath11 , in contradiction to what is inferred from the x - ray data .    in an attempt to solve the problem , one can think about considering that a fraction of the reprocessed flux is transmitted through the cloud instead of being fully emitted toward the hot plasma ( see ac00 ) .",
    "however , this does not increase the observed @xmath92 ratio .",
    "in fact , the opposite occurs . due to the additional losses , amplification of the uv field in the cloud cavity is less efficient and , for a given covering factor , the observed @xmath92 ratio is lower .",
    "this apparent discrepancy can be overcomed if one consider that we assumed that all the soft radiation is produced trough reprocessing of the hard x - rays , _ without any additional source of uv radiation_. the data simply suggest that such additional sources of uv radiation are present in real sources .",
    "these sources of uv radiation could be external , and not directly related to the central cloud system .",
    "for example , an external disc could be responsible for a significant ( if not the largest ) fraction of the observed uv emission .",
    "then , the expected distribution uv to x luminosity ratio will depend on additional parameters such as the disc inner radius or inclination . estimating the @xmath92 distribution would require additional assumptions and several physical complications . from a qualitative point of view",
    "however , it is obvious that the resulting distribution would extend up to larger @xmath92 , as required by the data .",
    "such an outer source of uv radiation is unlikely to contribute sensibly to the cooling of the central source neither to the reflected component .",
    "thus , our estimates for @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are still valid , as well as our conclusion drawn from the comparison with data : the present model enable to explain the main properties of the hard x - ray continuum observed in seyfert galaxies provided that the passive clouds are distributed at distances @xmath10 , in the range @xmath83@xmath8 from the central hot plasma region of radius  @xmath8 .",
    "another possibility is that the additional source of uv luminosity would be located in the cold clouds themselves .",
    "then , the excess soft luminosity may affect the radiative equilibrium and subsequently the emitted spectrum .",
    "we thus have to take it into account when computing the spectral characteristics and distributions .",
    "this , in turn , requires some additional assumptions on the energy dissipation process presumed to be active in the clouds . then however , it makes it possible to build a simple self - consistent model accounting for the uv to hard x - ray spectral properties of the continuum emitted in seyfert galaxies .",
    "this is the aim of the next section .",
    "there may be some mechanism providing a substantial dissipation in the cold medium , even if we consider spherical accretion .",
    "an example of such mechanism is turbulent dissipation at shocks ( chang & ostriker 1985 ) that are likely to form due to the development of spatial instabilities ( kovalenko & eremin 1998 ) .",
    "it is out of the scope of this paper to discuss or model accurately the dissipation mechanism .",
    "the only assumption that we will make about the dissipation process , is that the total relative power dissipated in the cold phase grows linearly with the covering factor i.e. : @xmath94    it is indeed quite natural to assume that dissipation increases with the amount of matter in the cold phase .",
    "this is also required by the existence of the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation .",
    "our prescription consists in choosing the simplest ( linear ) function enabling to produce a @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation .",
    "the @xmath95 coefficient represents the highest relative dissipation possible in the cold phase .",

    ", we will assume that @xmath95 is a ( nearly ) universal constant .",
    "we will consider it as a free parameter and try to get some constraints with the data .",
    "it is obvious that increasing the internal dissipation parameter @xmath95 , will have a similar effect on @xmath0 , as decreasing the distance ratio @xmath21 . in both cases , the cooling soft radiation flux entering",
    "the hot phase becomes larger , the amplification factor diminishes and the spectrum softens .",
    "as the effects of both parameters almost compensate , very similar @xmath96 curves may be obtained for very different values @xmath95 and @xmath21 provided they are adjusted together in order to keep @xmath96 unchanged .",
    "one can derive a simple relation between @xmath95 and @xmath21 enabling to conserve @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , expression  [ eq : spherampl ] for the amplification factor can be rewritten using the prescription of equation  [ eq : bigprescription ] :    @xmath97 } { \\xi\\left(1+\\eta/2\\right)c}. \\label{eq : amplificationsimp}\\ ] ]    for simplification , in this expression , second order effects due to reflection have been neglected ( i.e. we set @xmath12@xmath280 ) .",

    "solid and dashed curves are very close from each other .",
    "there are only minor differences due to effects of reflection .",
    "the global properties of the @xmath0 vs @xmath11 relation are thus unchanged when dissipation in the cold clouds is taken into account .",
    "only the distance - scale is different .    from equation  [ eq : reflection ]",
    ", one can see that @xmath1 is fully independent of @xmath95 . and , as quoted in section  [ sec : closeclouds ] , @xmath1 is almost independent of @xmath10 , specially when @xmath10 is large .",
    "this can be seen on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rgdec ] , the dashed curves show the @xmath1 versus @xmath11 relation for different distances ( @xmath21@xmath834 ) , corresponding to those of the right panel .",
    "they are almost indistinguishable from each other .",
    "the model will always produce the correct range of @xmath1 values .",
    "then , the shape of the predicted @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation at constant @xmath21 , appears to be nearly unchanged provided that @xmath10 and @xmath95 are tuned simultaneously according to equation  [ eq : constantgammac ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spher_ldproptoc ] , the dashed lines show the model @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation for @xmath95@xmath2860 .",

    "the strong dissipation in the cold phase cools the plasma down to very low temperatures and the spectra are too soft , on the other hand , large @xmath10 values produce too hard spectra .      when dissipation is assumed , the data points , considered in the @xmath21-@xmath11 plane , shift toward larger @xmath21 .",
    "the shift in distance can be estimated using equation  [ eq : constantgammac ] .",
    "indeed , we know from section  [ sec : closeclouds ] that for @xmath95@xmath280 the average distance is @xmath21@xmath281.7 .",

    "it may also tell us that the dissipation process has to provide a fixed amount of dissipation per unit surface of reflector .",
    "the numerical constant in front of the relation is close to unity .",

    "we conclude that fixing the universal relative dissipation to be roughly @xmath116 , and the distance @xmath117 , enable to explain the @xmath1 and @xmath0 distribution , their correlation and , independently the observed distribution of @xmath92 .",
    "this result is not very sensitive to the exact value of the parameters : a qualitative agreement can be achieved in a quite large region of the parameter space .",
    "the observed column density of absorbing cold material on the line of sight of seyfert 1 galaxies is usually quite weak ( @xmath118 @xmath56 ) . as already quoted by celotti et al .",
    "( 1992 ) this may indicate that the cloud column density is low .",
    "a larger amount of absorbing material would induce a characteristic hardening of the spectral slope in the soft x - ray , since the lower energy photons are more likely to be absorbed than harder ones .",
    "such an absorption feature would be easily detected .",
    "however , our comparisons with the data have shown that , at least for some sources , large covering factors are required .",
    "a low absorbing column density is not compatible with a large fraction of primary radiation being intercepted ( up to 8090  per cent ) .",
    "a possibility would be , on the contrary , to have the clouds optically _ very _ thick ( i.e. highly absorbing , @xmath119 ) .",
    "so that , the fraction of escaping x - ray luminosity intercepting the clouds would be fully blocked , while the rest would escape without any spectral alteration .",
    "the constraints on the clouds column density are less stringent at low covering factor .",
    "then , the effects of absorption on the observed spectrum are weak in any case .",
    "the observed @xmath1 and @xmath0 distributions suggest that most of the sources are observed with a low covering factor . according to the distribution  [ eq : pdec1 ]",
    ", 75  per cent of the observed objects would have @xmath120 .",
    "thus , for most of the observed sources the cloud optical thickness may be low .",
    "when the amount of darkening material is increased , it is likely that the additional matter spreads in the three dimensions , so that its radial optical depth grows together with the surface covered .",
    "still , the absorption effects might be observable in some sources , with large covering fractions i.e. very steep power law spectrum . at low energy",
    "( @xmath77 10 kev ) the radiation escapes only through the uncovered parts of the source . above 20 kev",
    "the clouds are transparent to radiation , the observed 20 - 30 kev flux could be larger than the extrapolation of the 2 - 10 kev one , by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "this would induce a strong hardening of the spectrum similar to what is observed in some obscured seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "since such a characteristic is specific to the quasi - spherical accretion scenario , a detailed investigation of the soft gamma - ray spectrum of the softest seyfert 1 galaxies would be of great interest .",
    "however , even at high energy , the radiation still suffers compton down scattering on the cold matter .",
    "if the cloud thomson optical depth is large , the energy loss is important and the down scattered radiation is absorbed before escaping from the cloud .",
    "this may limit the observability of the absorption features .",
    "if , as suggested in section  [ sec : absfea ] , the clouds are highly absorbing , it may arise that in some objects , the x - ray source is completely hidden , either because one large cloud is on the line of sight , or because a particular cloud distribution happens to fully cover the x - ray source as seen from earth .",
    "obviously such sources would be very unlikely to be detected .",
    "such an effect may explain that according to the @xmath11 distribution derived from the data , we observe much more sources with a low covering factor than highly covered ones .    indeed , for a nearly homogeneous intrinsic @xmath11-distribution , and if , for the observer , the angular size of an individual cloud , is much larger than the hot source size ( i.e. in the limit of extended clouds at large distances ) , the probability of detecting a source decreases exactly like its uncovered fraction @xmath121 .",
    "in the general case , the exact @xmath11-distribution depends on the average number of clouds , and their distance and size distributions .",
    "in addition , both size and number are likely to be a function of @xmath11 . depending on the details",
    ", one can reasonably get a distribution decreasing more or less according to @xmath122 with @xmath109 in the required range .",
    "this kind of extinction effects are more likely to occur if the cloud distance is large .",
    "simple geometrical considerations show that a complete extinction is possible only when @xmath123 . even above this limit ,",
    "strong departure from spherical geometry may be required .",
    "such effects are thus unlikely to be important at low @xmath21 ( i.e.if there is no dissipation in the clouds ) . on the other hand , the observed @xmath11-distribution may be strongly affected by such selection effects if the clouds are at a larger distance , i.e. @xmath124 , as considered in section  [ sec : remoteclouds ] .    in the case",
    "where the source of primary emission is hidden , it might be detected in the x - rays through the reflected radiation coming from the clouds themselves .",
    "thus , if obscuring effects are important , we can expect to detect some very faint sources with infinite reflection coefficient .",
    "such detections have not been reported . however , at least one previously known and usually bright source ( ngc4051 ; guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 ) has been observed in a very faint state dominated by reflection .",
    "such spectrum can be interpreted as being due to a obscuring event .",
    "the obscuring clouds of the present model can not be identified with the obscuring material that hide the broad line region ( blr ) in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the blr is at large distance from the black hole ( @xmath125 gravitational radius @xmath126 ) , so the obscuring material is , at least , at a similar distance . on the other hand",

    "therefore , the source statistic is expected to be different .",
    "it is not clear if such a spherical model could explain the complex temporal behavior of galactic sources , whose interpretation generally requires the presence of a disk very close to the central object .",
    "actually , the striking spectral similarities between gbh sources and seyfert galaxies ( similar hard x - ray spectra , correlation r-@xmath0 ) , are probably due to the universal properties of compton self - regulated plasma",
    ". the underlying heating process and geometry could be however very different .",
    "we focussed on the properties of the continuum spectra and did not attempt to model any line emission .",
    "it is however worth mentioning the iron k@xmath109 fluorescence line at 6.4 kev .",
    "such lines are indeed commonly observed in seyfert galaxies ( nandra & pounds 1994 ; nandra et al .",
    "they generally present a broad , possibly red - shifted profile .",
    "the usual interpretation is that the line forms trough illumination of the innermost part of an accretion disc .",
    "the line profile then appears broadened and red shifted due to special and general relativistic effects ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ; tanaka et al .",
    "it seems however that some alternative mechanisms may produce the broad line profiles without a disc ( see karas et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "such mechanisms include :    1 .",
    "radiative transfer effects , like reflection by a ionized medium with an intermediate temperature ( @xmath129 kev ) .",
    "this warm medium could be the transition region located between the hot phase and the cold clouds .",
    "doppler effects due to cloud motions .",
    "for example , if the clouds form an out - flowing wind .",
    "the line is formed by reflection on the inner side of the clouds traveling away from the observer .",
    "it is then doppler red - shifted and broadened due to the spread in the clouds radial velocities .",
    "3 .   gravitational red - shift , if the size the system is small enough .    or a combination of these different effects .",
    "note also that a recent reanalysis of the _ asca _ data ( lubinski & zdziarski  2000 ) indicates that in most of sources , the broadening is much less important than previously thought .",
    "we assumed that the clouds are dense enough so that the ionization parameter is low ( @xmath130 ) and the ionization effects are weak ( e.g. ycki et al .",
    "1994 ) . then",
    ", the cloud albedo is low @xmath26 and most of the hard x - rays impinging on the clouds are absorbed .    for large ionization parameter a ionized skin forms on the irradiated surface of the clouds .",
    "such ionization may have important effects on the radiative equilibrium ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kalman 2000 ) and change many observational parameters such as the hard x - ray spectral slope , the amplitude of the reflection component or the uv to x - ray luminosity ratio .",
    "despite we restricted our considerations to neutral clouds , most of our analytical estimates , given in section  [ sec : estimates ] , may be used to study ionized cases , simply by setting the cloud albedo to a convenient value .",
    "only equation  [ eq : spherr ] , giving the reflection amplitude , would breakdown .",
    "indeed , the @xmath1 parameter , as measured in spectral fits gives the amount of reflection on a nearly neutral matter .",

    "the distance is constrained to be lower than @xmath135 , by the maximum observed uv to x flux ratios .",
    "fixing @xmath136 ( and @xmath137 ) enables us to understand the bulk of the uv emission as being emitted by the spherical reflector itself .",

    "the distribution of @xmath92 ratios derived from this @xmath11-distribution is consistent with the observed one .",
    "if the cloud distance is lower than 8.5@xmath8 , the @xmath92 data suggest that part of the observed uv flux is emitted by some additional source , external to the cloud system .",
    "this simple model , with a limited number of parameters , enables us to understand the bulk of the phenomenological properties of the continuum emitted in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
