    "in the mid - twentieth century , @xcite published a work which would be the basis of the halo model . in that paper",
    "the authors proposed a novel model for the spatial distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "to build up their model they imposed four main assumptions : ( i ) galaxies in the universe lie inside galaxy clusters ; ( ii ) the number of galaxies belonging to a cluster obeys a probabilistic law ; ( iii ) there is a probabilistic law which describes the distribution of galaxies inside such galaxy clusters ; and ( iv ) the cluster centres are placed in the space under a quasi - uniform probabilistic law .",
    "although this formalism was originally thought to describe the distribution of galaxies it was later generalized to describe the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in its standard form",
    "the model assumes that all the matter in the universe reside in matter haloes which have a spherical density profile .",
    "in addition the halo - halo self - correlation at large scales is governed by the linear power spectrum . in this sense",
    ", the standard halo model does not include any assumption about alignments in the halo - halo distribution .",
    "however , it is well known from numerical simulations , that haloes exhibit mildly aspherical shapes , with a slight preference towards prolate forms ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) . moreover",
    ", it has been shown that their orientations are related to the surrounding structures such as filaments and large - scale walls @xcite .",
    "this results are also supported by observations showing a good agreement with those obtained from the galaxy group shapes alignment with the galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "most of these studies perform statistics on the inclinations of halo axes with respect to directions defined by the surrounding structure .",
    "this structure is characterized by the particle distribution through various topological signatures such as filaments , walls or voids ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "while these studies agree about the presence of alignments within the @xmath0cdm context , the magnitude of the alignment effect depends strongly on the geometrical definition of the surrounding structure . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have introduce a new approach which is independent of any definition of surrounding structure .",
    "this approach uses a modified version of the classical two - point cross - correlation function to quantify the alignment between centre objects and the large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "furthermore , this modified cross - correlation function allows a robust comparison between numerical simulations and observational data .",
    "this approach has successfully characterized alignments between galaxy shapes , group shapes and simulated dark matter haloes with surrounding structure traced by galaxies or simulated structures @xcite .",
    "relevant to this work are the studies by @xcite .",
    "these authors investigated the effects of halo triaxiality and lss alignment on the isotropic power spectrum .",
    "they found that the effect of halo triaxiality manifests a small suppression of power at the 1-halo term , whereas in the 2-halo regime they found an upper limit of @xmath1% of clustering increment , by imposing perfectly aligned haloes .",
    "these correlations on halo triaxiality can affect cosmic shear studies used to analyse weak lensing @xcite .",
    "moreover , an intrinsic alignment in the structure traced by galaxies could result in a spurious contribution to the shear power spectrum .",
    "in this paper we derive an analytical model for the anisotropic halo - matter cross correlation function .",
    "we implement an extension of the classical halo model for the large - scale matter distribution , that includes triaxial modelling of halo profiles ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their alignments ( described in  [ sec : anisotropic - halo - model ] ) .",
    "the use of the correlation function instead of the power spectrum allows a straightforward implementation of alignment effects and triaxiality of the haloes .",
    "furthermore , this anisotropic cross - correlation functions can be easily measured from observations and numerical results as showed in previous works @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main goal of the present work is to obtain a suitable analytic model for these functions in order to compare with numerical .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follow . in  [ sec : anisotropic - halo - model ] we introduce the anisotropic halo model and we describe some assumptions performed . in  [ sec : implementation ] we describe the numerical implementation . in  [ sec : comparison ] we compare the halo - matter cross - correlation functions obtained from our model with those estimated from n - body simulations . finally , we discuss and summarize our results in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the analytic development of a new halo model which takes into account the triaxial nature of the haloes and its alignment with the environment . as in the standard halo model",
    ", we will assume that the matter distribution is made up of distinct haloes in a wide range of masses .",
    "we characterize each dark matter halo in terms of its mass normalized density profile @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the position respect to the centre of an halo of mass @xmath4 , the components of @xmath5 are the eigenvalues of the shape tensor of the halo ( with @xmath6 ) , and @xmath7 indicates the direction of the eigenvectors ( i.e. its components are the tree euler angles of the shape ellipsoid orientation ) . assuming that all dark matter lies inside haloes , the density field @xmath8 can be computed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of haloes in the universe .",
    "similarly , the number density of haloes @xmath11 can be expressed as follow @xmath12 where the factor @xmath13 is the selection function , and @xmath14 is the dirac delta function centred at the halo position .    the probability distribution @xmath15 of haloes with mass @xmath4 , shape vector @xmath5 and orientation @xmath7 can be computed using the equation @xmath16 where the angle brackets denote the average over an ensemble of realizations . in case that shapes and orientations",
    "are not taken into account , this function reduces to the standard mass function . from the above definitions , the mean dark matter density and the mean number density can be computed as : @xmath17 @xmath18    hereafter the integration limits should be understood as taken over the whole range where the integrand is valid .",
    "the @xmath19 function allows us to impose some restrictions on the mass range , shape and orientation of the centre haloes .    using these function we are able to compute the halo - matter cross correlation function as follow :",
    "@xmath20 where we have assumed the ensemble average can be replaced by an space average : @xmath21 and similarly @xmath22    replacing [ rho ] and [ nc ] in equation [ xihm ] we obtain : @xmath23    it is possible to split this equation in two terms , those where @xmath24 ( hereafter 1-halo term ) , and those where @xmath25 ( hereafter 2-halo term ) . consequently we define : @xmath26 @xmath27    rewritting equation [ xi1h ] as : @xmath28    using equation [ massfuncgen ] , the final expression for the 1-halo term results : @xmath29    a similar procedure can be used to derive the 2-halo term from equation [ xi2h ] : @xmath30    the joint probability to have a pair of haloes with a given set of properties ( mass , shape and orientation ) at a distance @xmath31 , can be written @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , are the probabilities to have a halo with a given set of properties ( mass , shape and orientation ) , and @xmath35 is the join probability to have a pair of haloes with the given properties separated by a distance @xmath36 . in the right hand side we have assumed that the probability of halo properties ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and the join probability to have a pair of haloes separated by a distance @xmath39 are independent . therefore , using this last equation , the final expression for the 2-halo term is given by : @xmath40    unlike standard models , equations [ xi1hf ] and [ xi2hf ] give a halo model for the two - point anisotropic cross - correlation function taken into account the shape and the orientation of haloes .",
    "we will devote the next two sections to explain our implementation of this model in order to compare with the corresponding measured correlations in the simulation .      in order to estimate the 1-halo term ( equation [ xi1hf ] )",
    ", we need to adopt models for the halo normalized density profile ( @xmath41 ) and for the distribution of halo parameters ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "regarding the density profile , we use the triaxial model described by @xcite ( hereafter js ) .",
    "this model assumes that isodensity surfaces of dark matter can be described by triaxial ellipsoids with a shape vector @xmath5 and an orientation @xmath7 .",
    "a simple way to parametrize those surfaces is through the radial parameter @xmath43 as defined by @xcite : @xmath44 accordingly to js , the former definition allows to express the halo density profile similarly to that in @xcite ( nfw profile ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a characteristic density and @xmath47 is a scale radius .",
    "analogously to the scale radius in nfw profile , js define @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the concentration parameter and @xmath50 is the characteristic radius .",
    "js also provides the relations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the virial concentration and radius , respectively .",
    "it is possible to relate the characteristic density @xmath46 with the concentration parameter by requiring that the mean density inside an ellipsoid with major axis @xmath50 to be @xmath55 times the critical density , obtaining : @xmath56 js provides a relation involving this the equivalent density @xmath55 as function of the virialization density in a spherical nfw : @xmath57 a value of @xmath58 was obtained by the authors fitting numerical simulations .",
    "we found that a @xmath59 value of @xmath60 , is also consistent with simulation data and provides a better agreement between the nfw profile and the js profile at the spherical shape limit . in this limit case ,",
    "our choice for the @xmath59 parameter gives similar values for the @xmath46 and the characteristic density of the nfw profile in a mass range of @xmath61 to @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "once the normalized density profile has been established , we must set up the probability distribution @xmath64 . for simplicity , we assume that the orientation @xmath7 and the mass @xmath4 of a given halo are independent random variables , whereas the halo shape vector @xmath5 is only dependent on the mass .",
    "consequently the probability distribution can be written as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the halo mass function , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the orientation and shape probability distributions , respectively .",
    "for instance , in case of a uniform probability for the halo orientation on the sphere , the density function @xmath67 takes the form : @xmath69 where the euler angles are restricted to the ranges : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . +",
    "given that equation [ isodef ] can be written in term of the ratios @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we define the @xmath68 conditional probability distribution as a function of these quotients @xmath75 , where both arguments are restricted to the interval @xmath76 . with this simplification , we are able to exchange @xmath77 in equations [ xi1hf ] and [ xi2hf ] .",
    "we approximate this distribution by a product of two gaussian laws and quadratic factors that ensure null probability in the interval limits . ) or an ellipsoid with a null semi - axis have a null measurement ] consequently , the shape distribution takes the following form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are two mass dependent parameters which must be estimated , whereas a fixed value @xmath81 is adopted . a theoretical approach to this function",
    "was made by @xcite .",
    "however , their results are not in good agreement with the numerical simulation . on the other hand",
    ", js used a direct measurement of the axis ratios on dark matter haloes extracted from n - body simulations with the aim to find the density distribution . in our work , we adopt the analytical form given by equation [ eq : forma ] , which resembles the shape distribution obtained from the simulations .",
    "the two free parameters of the adopted distribution are used to fit the cross - correlation function .    the last ingredient required in order to estimate",
    "the 1-halo term is the mass function @xmath66 , which describes the abundance of dark matter haloes in a mass interval around @xmath4 .",
    "this function is estimated using the analytical formulae provided by @xcite .      in the current section",
    "we will set the corresponding functions for the 2-halo term . to compute equation [ xi2hf ] we need to specify the function @xmath82 . on large scales",
    "the relation between haloes and matter overdensity is deterministic , therefore , as in the standard halo model , we can approximate @xmath83 by the following equation : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the bias factors for the centre and tracer haloes , respectively , and @xmath87 is the fourier transform of the linear power spectrum ( lps ) .",
    "we have explicitly introduced the factor @xmath88 to take into account the different alignments .",
    "we have adopted the analytical expression of the bias function given by @xcite whereas the lps is computed using the approach given by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath89 function defined above can be used to describe two types of alignments : ( i ) the alignment between the position of tracer haloes and the major - axis direction of centre halo , ( ii ) the alignment between the orientations of centre and tracer haloes .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the last kind of alignment has a second order effect on the model .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that our model , and previous works ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are insensitive to the halo shapes in the 2-halo term .",
    "this is expected given that the difference between the major and minor axes of a halo is small compared to the distances , at these scales , between centre and tracer haloes .",
    "consequently , for the sake of simplicity , we have assumed that the alignment function does not depend on the alignment between the major axes of centre and tracer haloes .",
    "furthermore , we will consider this function as independent of halo shapes . based on the previous considerations we adopt the following expression : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the polar and azimuth angle of @xmath36 in a spherical coordinate system defined by the directions given by @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the first ( second ) term in the preceding equation can be understood as the excess of correlation along the major ( intermediate ) axis .",
    "as the alignment function is a probability density distribution , the constant of proportionality is defined by its normalization .",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath95 factors are free parameters that we will determine in  [ mlm ] .",
    "figure [ fig : sabana ] shows an illustrative example of the alignment function with parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it should be noticed that even when @xmath91 approach to @xmath98 and @xmath92 tend to be undetermined , the alignment nicely becomes constant by construction , avoiding any undesirable behaviour on its evaluation .",
    "the increment of the function towards low @xmath91 values represents the alignment of the matter distribution around the major shape axis , whereas the increment towards @xmath99 and @xmath100 represents the corresponding alignment with the intermediate axis .",
    "= 0.5    = 1.0",
    "in this section we first describe the numerical method used to compute the integrals [ xi1hf ] and [ xi2hf ] .",
    "secondly , we show the results for the three - dimensional anisotropic cross - correlation function .",
    "given the high order integrations involved in the 1-halo and 2-halo terms of our model , standard numerical methods ( e.g. quadrature rules ) are not feasible to implement . in order to compute the multidimensional integrals",
    "we have employed a monte carlo technique ( mc ) . according to this method , the @xmath101dimensional integral @xmath102 of a given function @xmath103 in the volume @xmath104 can be approximated by means of the following expression : @xmath105 where @xmath106 , are @xmath10 uniform random vectors within the computational volume @xmath107 .",
    "it can be shown that the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath102 decreases as @xmath108 independently of the dimension of the integrand .",
    "it is possible to improve the precision of the mc integration by using the importance sampling method .",
    "this method requires the specification of a density function @xmath109 for the random variable @xmath110 .",
    "thus , in the right hand side of equation [ imc ] , @xmath111 must be replaced by @xmath112 .",
    "it is worth to mention that using standard integration methods , for a fixed number of subdivisions @xmath10 of the volume @xmath113 , the error @xmath114 quickly increases as the number of dimensions increase ( @xmath115 ) . + as stated in the preceding paragraph , to estimate the integrals [ xi1hf ] and [ xi2hf ] we should generate as many random numbers as possible .",
    "the monte carlo integration is an embarrassingly parallel problem , so we have employed the nvidia cuda extension for c language in order to compute the integrals .",
    "this choice allows us to increase the amount of random numbers and consequently to enhance the precision of the results while the total running time grows moderately .      before comparing our halo model with results obtained from numerical simulations",
    ", we compute the cross - correlation function along the shape axis directions of the centre halo in order to give a qualitatively analysis of the parameter dependence . for this purpose , we fix the orientation of the centre halo such that the directions of the shape axes correspond to cartesian axes ( denoted by @xmath116 , respectively ) . accordingly to this choice , the integral in equation [ xi1hf ] ( [ xi2hf ] ) is reduced to a 3-d ( 12-d ) integration .",
    "we define three correlation functions by taking @xmath117 where @xmath118 .    with the aim of describing qualitatively the behaviour of our model for different values of @xmath79",
    ", @xmath80 , @xmath94 & @xmath95 , figure [ fig : direction ] shows the anisotropic cross - correlations for haloes in the mass range @xmath119 .",
    "the three directions , major , intermediate and minor axis are shown with solid , dotted and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "each panel corresponds to a different set of parameters .",
    "upper panels show the correlation function behaviour when the shape parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 are changed . as can be seen in panel @xmath120 when @xmath121 and @xmath94 & @xmath95 are properly set , the three functions show roughly constant differences .",
    "panel @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) shows the results for prolate ( oblate ) halo shapes @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) whereas panel @xmath126 shows the behaviour for a nearly spherical halo shape , i.e. @xmath127 .",
    "regarding to the alignment function , lower panels in figure [ fig : direction ] illustrate the effect of changing @xmath94 and @xmath95 parameters .",
    "panels @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) show the influence when assuming low and high values of @xmath95 ( @xmath94 ) , respectively .",
    "as can be appreciated , for large values of the @xmath94 parameter the alignment vanishes because the alignment distribution function is nearly constant . from this qualitative analysis",
    ", it can be seen that the behaviour of the model shows a large versatility with the parameters variation .",
    "furthermore , as expected , the parameters @xmath79 & @xmath80 mainly affect the 1-halo term whereas the parameters @xmath94 & @xmath95 are involved only in the 2-halo computation .",

    "in this work we have developed a formalism to compute the anisotropic halo - matter cross - correlation function .",
    "main ingredients added to the classic halo model are the triaxial nature of halo profiles , their probability distribution on axis ratios and the probability of alignments between two haloes .",
    "since we are interested to quantify the anisotropic alignment of dark matter haloes through the cross - correlation functions , we have chosen to develop this formalism on real space opposite to the standard halo model which is computed on fourier space .",
    "this choice impose the calculation of multidimensional integrals in both , 1-halo and 2-halo terms , which were estimated by implementing a monte carlo integration technique .    as mentioned in the previous paragraph ,",
    "we have introduced two probability functions .",
    "one of them characterising halo shape distribution and the other describing the alignment between dark matter haloes .",
    "each of these functions has two free parameters which allow to quantify the influence of halo alignment and halo shape on the anisotropic cross - correlation function .    as a first test of our algorithm ,",
    "we have compared the isotropic cross - correlation functions obtained from a numerical simulation with the results of the anisotropic halo model averaging on a spherical volume .",
    "we have found that taking the triaxial nature of dark matter haloes into account improves at least @xmath132 the predictions of the standard halo model , as can be seen on figure [ fig : iso ] .",
    "this improvement is more noticeable on scales corresponding to the 1-halo regime .",
    "this is in the same direction as pointed by @xcite in the sense that triaxial averaging of halo shapes produce small but noticeably deviation from the classic model .",
    "further comparison in a quantitative way are difficult to perform since we compute anisotropic cross - correlation functions whereas these authors only calculate the isotropic power spectrum .",
    "we have compared the predictions of our model with the results obtained from a numerical simulation , and we have estimated the best fitting parameters of the alignment and shape probability functions by means of a maximum likelihood method . we have found that our model is able to reproduce the numerical measurements over a wide range of scales , particularly in the 2-halo regime .",
    "moreover , the model parameters obtained by fitting these numerical results recover , as expected , the well known mass dependence of halo shapes and the alignment of dark matter haloes with the surrounding structure . the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 describe , in a intuitive way , the effect on the cross - correlation function of the possible alignment configuration between haloes at large scales .",
    "on the other side , the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 reflect the halo triaxiality at small scales , nevertheless the simplicity of the adopted profile does not allow a fit as good as in the case of the 2-halo regime .    in a forthcoming paper",
