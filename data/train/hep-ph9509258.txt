    "this corresponds to a typical selection cut on the diffractive hadron for identifying pomeron exchange events .",
    "the same cut on the incoming partons was made for the estimate of the inclusive jet cross sections .",

    ", we have verified that their cross sections are at least a few orders of magnitude smaller . also for the ndpe case , by a simple hand calculation of the total cross section using eqs .",
    "( [ dsig2 ] ) and ( [ forcx ] ) one can confirm the order of magnitudes quoted above . from this exercise ,",
    "the factor 4 increase at @xmath155 compared to @xmath156 is seen to arise primarily from the same factor increase in the accessible region of jet rapidity .",
    "we will comment on the implications of these calculations in the next section .",
    "we have estimated jet production in dpe processes , by a mechanism in which the whole of the momentum of the pomerons goes into the jets .",
    "the process has a quite dramatic signature : the final state consists of the two diffracted hadrons , two high-@xmath7 jets , and _ nothing _ else .",
    "it is a leading - twist contribution , not suppressed by a power of @xmath7 , despite the fact that the pomeron is a composite object .",
    "this is permitted because the factorization theorem does not apply to diffractive processes .",
    "moreover , the cross section is an order of magnitude larger or more than the obvious ingelman - schlein type process .",
    "the lack of pomeron beam jets is presumably the reason why we are able to get such large cross sections .",
    "our model is , of course , quite primitive .",
    "however , by being a complete and consistent calculation in lowest order perturbation theory , it does establish an important principle : that one can not treat the exchanged pomeron as a particle with associated parton densities .",
    "the approximations we have made are concerned only with extracting the leading power behavior in the appropriate kinematic limit .",
    "since gauge - invariance causes some quite non - trivial cancellations before the final result is obtained , the exact gauge invariance and consistency of our model is critical to establishing the general principles .",
    "we have also a new relation , eq .",
    "( [ forcx ] ) , which relates the dpe - to - jets cross section at zero momentum transfer to the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "this relation is independent of all details of the hadronic form factor , and depends only on the use of a two - gluon - exchange model .",
    "there are at least two obvious sources of large corrections to our model :    *  absorptive corrections due to extra exchanges of pomerons and gluons between those objects in our model that have very different rapidities .",
    "recent work by gotsman , levin and maor @xcite gives one way of tackling this problem .",
    "*  sudakov corrections that suppress the process of two gluons of low virtuality going into a hard process .",
    "standard qcd methods can presumably be applied here .    from ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , we expect that the true dpe - to - jets cross section will be an order of magnitude or more smaller than the values we have calculated . but remember that absorptive corrections will reduce all dpe cross sections , including fdpe .",
    "more precise modeling of the hadron form factor is also needed .",
    "but this is presumably a less important matter .",
    "we plan to return to these issues in a later paper .",
    "in addition , a comparison with existing data @xcite from the ua1 detector would be useful .",
    "since more experimental and phenomenological work is necessary to obtain correctly normalized cross sections , we will merely note here some orders of magnitude . at @xmath157 , ref .",
    "@xcite quotes a cross section for detected dpe events of @xmath158 , whereas streng s @xcite estimate for the same quantity is quoted as @xmath159 .",
    "this discrepancy is attributed to the stringent cuts imposed on the data .",
    "moreover , the experiment finds that @xmath160 of their events have one or more jets with @xmath7 above @xmath161 .",
    "normally , in a hadron - hadron collision , such a jet fraction would be impossibly high .",
    "for example , our fdpe cross section , in eq .",
    "( [ sigma.630 ] ) , after reduction by absorption and experimental cuts , is much smaller than the data .",
    "but our ndpe cross section is tens of @xmath162 , so until we apply absorption and sudakov corrections this partial cross section is in danger of being larger than the full dpe cross section .",
    "what we may reasonably conjecture is that hard scattering cross sections in dpe may be surprisingly high .",
    "although our cross sections are about an order of down from the fully inclusive jet cross section ( with the same cuts ) , it should be remembered that the dpe cross section ( without the jet requirement ) is itself much smaller than the total cross section @xcite .",
    "we suggest that a qualitative understanding of the large cross sections can be obtained by observing that , in our model , fig .",
    "[ fig.ndpemodel ] , we really do not have pomerons exchanged between the hadrons and the jets , but only single gluons . so that we get a color singlets coupling to the hadrons",
    ", it is sufficient to add one extra gluon exchanged between the two diffracted hadrons .",
    "if further examination supports the sizes of cross sections we predict , then the mechanism we are using could be very important for all kinds of studies .",
    "for example , one can produce the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "although the cross section would be a lot lower than the total higgs cross section , the lack of a background event could make up for the lower rate in terms of the usefulness of the signature , at least for certain ranges of parameters .",

    "<S> we treat hadron - hadron collisions where the final state is kinematically of the kind associated with double - pomeron - exchange ( dpe ) and has large transverse momentum jets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in addition to the conventional factorized ( fdpe ) contribution , there is a non - factorized ( ndpe ) contribution which has no pomeron beam jet . within a simple model we compute dpe - two - jet total and differential cross sections at tevatron energy scales , and </S>",
    "<S> show that the ndpe contribution is dominant .    </S>",
    "<S> when two hadrons collide at high energy , there is about a 10% chance that one of the incoming hadrons will survive into the final state , while losing only a small fraction of its energy . </S>",
    "<S> such events are called diffractive . </S>",
    "<S> the object that is exchanged in diffractive processes is called the `` pomeron '' . </S>",
    "<S> a primary characteristic is that cross sections with pomeron exchange are approximately independent of energy at high energy ; the pomeron has spin close to unity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there has been growing experimental evidence that within diffractive events , hard qcd processes can also occur , i.e. , processes with a large momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> such `` diffractive hard scattering '' has been been seen not only in hadron - hadron scattering by the ua1 and ua8 experiments @xcite , but also in electron - proton scattering at the h1@xcite and zeus@xcite experiments , both in the deep - inelastic regime and in photoproduction .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting class of diffractive hadron - hadron collisions , is where _ both _ hadrons survive unscathed , but leave a remnant system in the central region of final - state rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> such events are called double - pomeron exchange ( dpe ) events @xcite . in effect </S>",
    "<S> , one can try to consider such processes as pomeron - pomeron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose in this paper is to explore the properties of jet production in dpe events , and in particular the breakdown of hard - scattering factorization . </S>",
    "<S> jet production by dpe has been reported @xcite in the ua1 detector .    </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model for diffractive hard scattering is due to ingelman and schlein @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they treat each exchanged pomeron as a particle , in the same manner as one obtains photoproduction cross sections from electron - hadron scattering at small momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> diffractive hard scattering is then obtained by the use of parton densities in the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> the model is used in much phenomenology @xcite , and has been applied to dpe@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as collins , frankfurt and strikman ( cfs ) @xcite explained , the ingelman - schlein model is not valid in qcd , even though the model forms a useful phenomenological benchmark @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cfs also predict a specific signature of the breakdown of factorization , that at the leading twist level all the momentum of the pomeron can go into the hard scattering  the process is `` super - hard '' or `` lossless '' . </S>",
    "<S> ua8 @xcite data gives experimental support to this result .    </S>",
    "<S> our present paper shows how the mechanism of collins , frankfurt and strikman applied to dpe at the level of lowest - order feynman graphs provides a striking mechanism for the breakdown of factorization , and we turn it into a quantitative , if crude , model the model is in effect a version of the low - nussinov - gunion - soper model @xcite , and the same model was used by berera and soper @xcite to understand properties of the pomeron s structure function . </S>",
    "<S> we will calculate the cross section for jet production in dpe . </S>",
    "<S> the important free parameter in our model is an overall normalization which can be determined from elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> pumplin @xcite has done some calculations in the same model , but without the strongly dominant gluon - gluon subprocess . </S>",
    "<S> we call the model non - factorizing double - pomeron - exchange ( ndpe ) , to contrast it with the ingelman - schlein model applied to dpe , which we call factorized double - pomeron - exchange ( fdpe ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the dramatic feature of our model is that the pomerons have no beam jets ; the final state is then exceptionally clean , because it consists of the two isolated , diffracted hadrons , the high transverse - momentum jets , and nothing else . </S>",
    "<S> not only are such processes theoretically interesting in their own right , but they have advantages for certain kinds of new particle searches , provided the cross section is high enough , because a lot of the background event is no longer present . </S>",
    "<S> production processes of heavy flavors and higgs are two such examples . </S>",
    "<S> but studies of hard scattering in dpe should surely start with the simplest processes , jet production .    </S>",
    "<S> schfer , nachtmann and schpf @xcite have characterized the final states we calculate as `` exclusive '' production , with the ingelman - schlein process being a corresponding `` inclusive '' process .    </S>",
    "<S> although there has been a significant amount of work on hard processes with dpe , almost all of it has concerned production of heavy quarks and higgs bosons  see , for example , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , much of it has used the ingelman - schlein method , the fdpe process , which , as we will see , is much smaller than the ndpe process . the only work on the dpe - to - jets process that we know of is by pumplin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he used the same model as we did , but restricted his attention to the production of quark jets . as we will show in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec.zero ] , production of quark jets is very much smaller than the production of gluon jets , because it has a zero at zero momentum transfer . on the other hand , pumplin paid more attention to good modeling of the proton s elastic form factor .    </S>",
    "<S> donnachie and landshoff @xcite have developed an extensive phenomenology of a two - gluon model for the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> bialas and landshoff @xcite used this model to calculate higgs production by dpe . </S>",
    "<S> this model has many similarities to ours , and it includes better modeling of the non - perturbative part of the process . in particular , it has a more precise treatment of the pomeron - proton vertex and of the pomeron trajectory .    </S>",
    "<S> however , there is one important principle that our model establishes . </S>",
    "<S> this is that the exclusive processes of dpe to jets is leading twist . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite non - trivial , since in proving factorization , there are some very non - trivial cancellations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed some of our graphs are a power law larger than the final answer . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of the necessary cancellation relies on ward identities applied to the hard part , as we demonstrate around eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ afterwi ] ) below . to show that general principles do not imply some other cancellation </S>",
    "<S> , it is important to have a complete , consistent and gauge - invariant model . </S>",
    "<S> this is provided by our model , which consists of all the lowest - order feynman graphs that follow from a certain toy lagrangian .    </S>",
    "<S> our work also shows that one only has to be concerned about this kind of cancellation in the hard scattering part of the graphs . </S>",
    "<S> it also indicates what principles need to be applied in a general process . without taking the cancellations into account , </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the feynman graphs is much less efficient than it need be . </S>",
    "<S> of course , once these results have been established , one is free to do more precise modeling of the bound state .    </S>",
    "<S> lu and milana @xcite have also calculated higgs production by dpe , but they did not realize that there is a factorization - breaking mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> hence their cross section is too small , by orders of magnitude . </S>"
