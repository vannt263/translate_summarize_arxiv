    "in the most studied lattice model for the collapse transition ( also called coil - globule transition ) of polymers @xcite , the chains are represented by self - avoiding walks , so that the bonds of the chain are placed on lattice edges and the monomers are located on the sites .",
    "an attractive interaction between monomers on nearest - neighbor sites which are not linked by bonds is added .",
    "the competition between the repulsive excluded - volume interactions and the attractive interactions leads to a change in the polymerization transition of sasaw ( self - attracting self - avoiding walks ) in a grand - canonical formalism .",
    "experimentally , as the temperature of a polymer solution is lowered , the chain changes its configuration from extended ( coil ) to collapsed ( globule ) , as the temperature crosses a particular value , called the @xmath0-point . for weak attraction ,",
    "the transition between a non - polymerized and a polymerized phase in the monomer fugacity - temperature plane is continuous , becoming discontinuous as the attraction is increased , so that the collapse transition is a tricritical point in this model .",
    "the nature of this transition was studied through a mapping of the polymer model onto a ferromagnetic @xmath1 model in the limit @xmath2 , due to de gennes @xcite .",
    "the contributions to the high - temperature series expansion of the magnetic model are represented by self - avoiding walks on the lattice .",
    "mean field tricritical exponents are found in three dimensions , with logarithmic corrections .    in two dimensions ,",
    "non - classical exponents are expected , and a major result is due to duplantier and saleur ( ds ) , who managed to derive the exact tricritical exponents for the sasaw model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the proposal of this model , which requires some fine tuning to allow it to be solved , as a generic result for the collapse transition has been discussed in the literature soon after its proposal , and lead to numerical results which seem to support its robustness @xcite .",
    "another aspect of the problem are the phase diagrams of the variety of models related to the problem of the collapse transition .",
    "even a slight change in the sasaw model , if we assume that the attractive interactions are between polymer bonds on opposite sides of elementary squares of the square lattice , leads to a phase diagram which is different from the one found when the interactions are between monomers on nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites . in this model ,",
    "an additional polymerized phase appears , besides the non - polymerized and the regular polymerized phases , and the critical polymerization line ends at a critical endpoint @xcite .",
    "the self - avoidance constraint may also be changed , allowing for more than one monomer at the same site , but still restricting the number of polymer bonds on each lattice edge to at most one @xcite .",
    "this generalization of saw s , usually called trails , has the distinctive feature that the interactions are now between monomers _ at the same site_. on two - dimensional lattices , the trails may collide or cross at each site , and in the original model , which we will call the isat ( interacting self - avoiding trails ) model , the statistical weights of both configurations are the same . if , the trails are not allowed to cross themselves , so that only collisions of the trails on sites exist , we have a model called visaw ( vertex interacting self - avoiding walks ) , which was exactly solved by blte and nienhuis ( bn ) @xcite and has critical exponents for the collapse transition distinct from the ones found in the ds model .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature on which of the two distinct sets of exponents ( ds or bn ) is the generic result for the collapse transition of polymers .",
    "the bn exponents seem to be difficult to find in simulations , since numerical results for the exponents of the bn model seem to be closer to the ds values @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of stiffness in the visaw model , associating a bending energy to elementary bends of the chain , leads to an even richer phase diagram @xcite , with the tricritical points from both integrable models ( ds and bn ) residing on a multicritical line .",
    "the robustness of the ds exponents has also been discussed in a recent paper @xcite , where it has been shown that if crossings of the trails are included in the bn model , so that the lattice is no longer planar , the universality class is changed .",
    "although of course the analytic results mentioned above are of inestimable value , details of the phase diagrams of the different models are not always easily found with these techniques , and this is also true for simulations , in particular in the grand - canonical formalism , where the nature of the collapse transition was recognized to be tricritical by de gennes .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to study these phase diagrams with approximate analytic tools , among them solutions on hierarchical lattices such as the bethe and the husimi lattice .",
    "indeed , the isat model was recently studied on a four - coordinated husimi lattice built with squares and on a four and six - coordinated bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "rich phase diagrams were found in these studies , with the coil - globule transition for four - coordinated cases ( which are mean - field approximations for the square lattice ) being associated with a bicritical point . such behavior was confirmed in a recent study by pretti @xcite , where the isat model was generalized by including an attractive interaction between nn monomers on single occupied sites not linked by a polymer bond and solved on bethe and husimi lattices with @xmath3 . the visaw model ( when the crossings are forbidden and nn interactions vanish ) , the sasaw ( when crossings and collisions are not allowed ) , the model by wu and bradley @xcite ( when collisions and crossings have the same weight ) and the simple isat model ( when the nn interaction vanishes ) are recovered as particular cases .",
    "given the relevance of the semi - flexible extension of the visaw model @xcite in the discussion about the differences between the ds and the bn critical behaviors for the collapse transition , we investigate another generalization of trail models by including an energy associated to elementary bends .",
    "this is done here for bethe lattice , with different statistical weights associated to crossings and collisions , so that semi - flexible visaw and semi - flexible isat are obtained as particular cases of our model .",
    "it is shown that the inclusion of semi - flexibility does not change the nature of the collapse transition when compared with the flexible isat model studied before @xcite , but an additional polymerized phase appears inside the regular polymerized phase , which is both dense and nematic , since all lattice sites are visited and all bonds are in the same direction . for saw ,",
    "the semi - flexible and the self - attracting cases were studied on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "when both effects are present , studies on bethe and husimi lattices show the appearance of a second polymerized phase , which is dense and anisotropic in the sense that bonds in one particular direction are favored @xcite .",
    "the nature of the collapse transition is changed when the stiffness is sufficiently high , so that in this case also the appearance of a second polymerized phase signals the change of the nature of the collapse transition .",
    "the model we study is defined in more detail in section [ defmod ] and its solution on a bethe lattice is presented in section [ sbl ] .",
    "final discussions and the conclusion may be found in section [ conc ] .",
    "we consider a semi - flexible generalized self - avoiding trail ( sisat ) model . in this model ,",
    "each lattice edge can be occupied by at most one polymer bond , which has an activity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the chemical potential of a bond .",
    "the bonds connect monomers , which are placed on the sites of the lattice . for a lattice with coordination number @xmath7 , each lattice site",
    "can be occupied by up to @xmath8 ( for even @xmath7 ) and @xmath9 ( for odd @xmath7 ) monomers . in two dimensions ,",
    "walks meeting at a lattice site may either cross or collide , as is apparent in the generalized isat model on a square lattice depicted in fig .",
    "[ figmodrq ] . in higher dimensions",
    ", however , the distinction between collisions and crossings is no longer clear .",
    "we will restrict our attention to lattices with @xmath3 here , whose solutions may be compared with results for the square lattice .",
    "statistical weights @xmath10 and @xmath11 will be associated for each crossing and collision of the chains , respectively .",
    "note that when @xmath12 we recover the classical isat model , while in the case @xmath13 ( crossings forbidden ) the visaw model is obtained . in order to analyze the effects of the polymer stiffness in such models ,",
    "an additional weight @xmath14 is introduced , associated to one polymer bend .",
    "if the energy @xmath15 associated to an elementary bend of the trails is positive ( @xmath16 ) , we say that the walks are semi - flexible .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figmodrq ] .",
    "the grand - canonical partition function of the model is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the numbers of bonds , collisions and crossings in the system , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 is the number of bends in sites with a single monomer , since the bends in double visited sites are accounted for in the weight @xmath11 , so that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the weight of the collision itself , i. e. , of the _ on - site _ monomer - monomer interaction at colliding sites .",
    "we will mostly restrict ourselves in the discussions to @xmath24 , so that the monomer - monomer interaction energy @xmath25 is the same for crossings and collisions , but it is easy to consider @xmath26 , and this will be done in part of the comments below . the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eqpartfunc ] ) is over all allowed configurations of the walks on the lattice we are considering , which will be the four coordinated bethe lattice here .     and @xmath10 , respectively , while bends at sites with two incoming bonds are indicated by @xmath27.,width=264 ]",
    "we solve the model on a four coordinated bethe lattice , which corresponds to the core of a cayley tree as shown in fig .",
    "the extremal monomers of each chain are placed on the surface of the tree .",
    "one possible configuration of three chains on a cayley tree with four generations of sites is shown in fig .",

    ".,width=264 ]    to solve the model on the bethe lattice we consider sub - trees , defining partial partition functions ( ppf s ) for them for a fixed configuration of the root edge @xcite . for the bethe lattice ,",
    "usually only two root configurations are needed , corresponding to the possibilities of empty or occupied ( by chain bonds ) root edges . however , as discussed above , in the semi - flexible case one may expect the appearance of anisotropic phases , which display orientational ( nematic ) ordering , so that bonds in one or more directions are favored . the study of models which present nematic ordering on such hierarchical lattices presents some difficulties , particularly for @xmath28 .",
    "one way to avoid them is to solve these models on other treelike lattices for which the exact solution is the bethe approximation on regular lattices with the same coordination number .",
    "one of such lattices is the random locally treelike layered ( rltl ) lattice introduced by dhar , rajesh and stilck @xcite to study nematic ordering of monodispersed rigid rods . here",
    "we will follow a simpler option , assuming that at each site of the @xmath3 bethe lattice two incoming bonds are in one direction and the two remaining ones are in a perpendicular direction .",
    "actually , one should keep in mind that in the thermodynamic limit this lattice is effectively infinite dimensional , as was shown by baxter @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , to correctly measure the euclidean distance between two sites on an even - coordinated bethe lattice , one may embed it in a hypercubic lattice whose dimension increases with the number of generations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will define partial partition functions for four root configurations : @xmath29 for a root edge in direction @xmath30 not occupied by a bond , @xmath31 for a empty root edge in direction @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 for subtrees with occupied root edges in directions @xmath30 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we now may obtain recursion relations for the ppf s of a sub - tree with an additional generation , considering the operation of attaching a new root site and edge to three sub - trees of the preceding generation .",
    "the results are :    @xmath35 , \\\\",

    "we note that we include the possibility of bonds in the two directions having different activities , although we will discuss the thermodynamic behavior of the model only for @xmath37 .    here",
    ", @xmath38 and @xmath39 are ppf s of sub - trees with @xmath40 and @xmath41 generations , respectively . usually , the ppf s diverge in the thermodynamic limit ( when @xmath42 ) .",
    "thus , it is suitable to define the ratios :    @xmath43    which should remain finite for non - dense phases , where a finite fraction of the lattice sites is empty .",
    "the recursion relations for these ratios are :    @xmath44    [ rrrb ]    we find four distinct fixed points for these recursion relations when @xmath37 , which are stable in distinct regions of the parameter space @xmath45 .",
    "they are :    * a non - polymerized ( * np * ) phase : @xmath46 , @xmath47 . * a regular polymerized ( * p * ) phase : @xmath48 and finite . * a dense polymerized ( * dp * )",

    "the edges corresponding to the direction of the ratio which diverges are all occupied by bonds .",
    "it is useful to define the reciprocal ratios @xmath54 to study the fixed points which are associated to these phases . for the * dp * phase we may rewrite the recursion relation eqs .",

    "if we consider the fixed point with bonds in the 1 direction , the recursion relations may be written in terms of the variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so that the fixed point again is located at the origin .",
    "the result is :    @xmath59    we notice that the product @xmath60 attains a finite value at the * an * fixed point , given by : @xmath61    the region of the parameter space where each fixed point is stable may be found by studying the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the recursion relations : @xmath62 where the @xmath63 s are the appropriate ratios in each case . in the * np * fixed point @xmath64 , the secular equation of the recursion relation ( [ rrrb ] ) is @xmath65 so that this fixed point is stable for : @xmath66 the secular equation associated to the * dp * fixed point @xmath67 is : @xmath68 and thus the region where this phase is stable will be : @xmath69 the secular equation for the * an * fixed point @xmath70 , @xmath46 is : @xmath71 from which it follows that this fixed point is stable if @xmath72 since @xmath73 ( as well as @xmath74 and @xmath27 ) are non - negative , the * an * phase is stable for allowed values of @xmath73 if @xmath75 , so that it exists only when @xmath76 .",
    "this is expected since the chains should be sufficiently stiff to generate nematic order .",

    "note that @xmath86 when @xmath87 , so that the * p * phase disappears in this limit . as will be shown below ,",
