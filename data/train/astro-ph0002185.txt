    "the majority of stars in giant ellipticals found in the cores of rich galaxy clusters are old ; photometric and spectroscopic studies of cluster galaxies out to @xmath2 suggest a formation redshift , , greater than 2 , with little variation within a cluster , and that secondary bursts of star formation account for a small fraction of the stellar mass (   aragn - salamanca  1993 ; ellis  1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson  1998 ; van dokkum  1998 ; poggianti  1999 ) .",
    "however , to understand the process of galaxy formation it is necessary to know where the stars were formed as well as when . in the traditional view of early - type galaxy formation  a `` monolithic '' collapse at high redshift (  eggen , lynden - bell & sandage  1962 ; larson  1969)all the stars were formed in situ , in direct contrast to the merger - driven growth of galaxies predicted by semi - analytical  models for hierarchical cosmologies , such as cdm (  kauffmann & white  1993 ; baugh , cole & frenk  1996 ) .",
    "since the ages of the stars are similar in both scenarios , it is the change in mass with look - back time that separates the two pictures observationally .",
    "the current data are inconclusive ; for example , the hierarchical models are favored  by the enhanced merger fraction seen in the @xmath3 cluster ms1054.4 - 0321 ( van dokkum  1999 ) , whilst de propris  ( 1999 )  show no evidence for mass evolution of bright ellipticals in clusters out to @xmath2 .",
    "in general it is difficult to follow the evolutionary history of ellipticals since selection methods can seriously bias the samples , c.f .",
    "the discussions of progenitor bias in van dokkum & franx  ( 1996 ) , the effect of preferential selection of the most massive objects at each epoch in kauffmann & charlot  ( 1998 ) , and the use of color  selection in jimenez  ( 1999 ) .",
    "one approach to minimising such problems is to study the evolution of a particular class of ellipticals ",
    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs)because of their unique location , close to the center  of the cluster s potential well",
    ". bcgs do not appear to be drawn from the same luminosity function as other cluster galaxies (  dressler  1978 ) , which suggests that they have a distinct formation history . knowledge of bcg evolution can therefore provide different constraints on galaxy formation models to studies of the general cluster population .",
    "the k - band hubble diagram for bcgs has recently been extended to @xmath2 by both collins & mann  ( 1998 ; hereafter cm98 )  and aragn - salamanca , baugh & kauffmann ( 1998 ; hereafter abk98 ) : these observations provide the opportunity to measure the luminosity evolution of bcgs since evolutionary and pass - band corrections are insensitive to the recent star - formation history of a galaxy at near - ir wavelengths (  bershady  1995 ; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson  1998 ) .",
    "the conclusions drawn are contradictory , despite the use of the same cosmology and a common assumption that the stellar populations of bcgs are old and passively evolving ; cm98  assert that the stellar populations of bcgs in the most massive clusters have not grown significantly since @xmath2 , whilst abk98  argue that their results are in good agreement with the mass increase of bcgs  by a factor of four in an einstein - de sitter cosmology  predicted by semi - analytical   models over the same redshift range .",
    "the two samples have almost no overlap ",
    "cm98  having used an x - ray  selected cluster catalogue whilst abk98  used a heterogeneous compilation that was mainly optically selected  and it is the aim of the present work to show that the results can be reconciled by considering the properties of the clusters in the two samples . section  [ data ] describes the bcg sample used an extension of that of cm98and the reduction methods employed , whilst section  [ results ] presents the results of the analysis and a comparison to those of abk98 . throughout this letter an einstein - de sitter cosmology with h@xmath4  km is assumed , and x - ray  luminosities ( ) are quoted for the 0.33.5  kev pass band .",
    "the data presented here comprise k - band observations of 76  bcgs . this sample , which incorporates that of cm98 , spans a redshift range of 0.05 to 0.83 , and is drawn from the following x - ray  selected cluster catalogues : the einstein emss ( gioia & luppino 1994 ; nichol  1997 ; henry 1999 ) , the southern and bright sharc catalogues ( burke  1997 ; romer  2000 ) , and the rosat nep survey ( henry  1997 ) .",
    "x - ray  selection is to be preferred , since both x - ray  luminosity and x - ray  temperature should be more closely related to cluster mass than optical richness .",
    "the x - ray  luminosity - redshift coverage of the cluster sample is shown by the circles in figure  1 .",
    "the additional symbols show those clusters from abk98  with a measured x - ray  flux or upper limit , except for cl  2155 + 0334 ( also known as cl  2157 + 0347 ) , which has been removed because photometric and spectroscopic observations show no evidence for a cluster ( thimm & belloni  1994 ; oke , postman & lubin  1998 ) , and cl  0016 + 16 , since it is in both samples .",

    "the dashed line , at @xmath9  , shows the luminosity used by cm98  to separate their sample into high- and low-  clusters .",
    "the k - band bcg observations were made using the ircam3 and ufti cameras on the ukirt and nsfcam on the irtf , with some of the data being provided by the service programs  of both telescopes .",
    "ircam3 and nsfcam are 256x256 pixel insb devices with a field of view close to 70  by 70  ( the ircam3 and nsfcam pixel scales are 0.281 and 0.3  pixel@xmath10 respectively ) , and ufti is a 1024x1024 pixel hgcdte array with a pixel scale of 0.091  pixel@xmath10 , giving a field of view of 92  by 92 .",
    "the observing strategy is the same as presented in cm98 : the bcgs were imaged using a jitter pattern and separate sky exposures were taken for those objects which filled the field of view .",
    "the data reduction system improves upon that presented in cm98 , and incorporates elements from the methods described in stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson  ( 1995 ) and hall , green & owen  ( 1998 ) .",
    "an outline is presented below as the method will be fully described in a later paper .",
    "the individual frames were masked for bad pixels , dark subtracted and divided by the exposure time .",
    "a flat field image was created by median combination of the object images  or separate sky exposures if these were available  and applied to the object frames .",
    "masking of cosmic ray events was performed on the flattened images before they were mosaiced together , which completed the processing of those objects with sky exposures .",
    "otherwise the mosaic  which is substantially deeper than the individual exposures  was used to create an object mask , which was then applied to the individual images before they were median - combined to form a flat .",
    "the flattened exposures were then processed as above to create the final image .",
    "observations of stars from the ukirt faint standards list ( casali & hawarden  1992 ) were used to calibrate the photometry onto the ukirt system assuming an extinction of 0.088 mag airmass@xmath10 , the median value for k - band observations at mauna kea .",
    "comparisons of the results from repeat observations , both within and between observing runs , show that the magnitudes agree to 0.05  mag .",
    "aperture magnitudes were measured using a 50  kpc diameter aperture and have been corrected for galactic absorption using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis  ( 1998 ) : the correction is small , mostly being less than 0.05  mag , but reaching 0.1  mag in several cases .",
    "the position of the aperture was chosen so as to maximise the flux contained within it whilst remaining close to the center  of the cluster x - ray  emission .",
    "those pixels contaminated by stars and obvious non - cluster galaxies were excluded from the calculation , being replaced by values chosen from regions at the same distance from the aperture center .",
    "no attempt has been made to remove flux due to other cluster galaxies falling within the aperture , and so the results are directly comparable to those of abk98 .",

    "the models have been normalised to match the low - redshift , x - ray selected , bcg sample of lynam  ( 1999 ) , following the method used in abk98 , assuming a growth curve , @xmath13/@xmath14 , of 0.7 for the aperture corrections and a color  of @xmath15 .",

    "the bottom panel shows the sample of abk98 , where the crosses are for those clusters without a measured x - ray  flux .",
    "the no - evolution prediction , assuming a 10  gyr old stellar population , is shown by the solid line ; passive - evolution models , in which the stars form at a single epoch , are shown as dashed ( @xmath11 ) and dotted ( @xmath12 ) lines .",
    "the result remains qualitatively the same as figure  6 of cm98 ; bcgs in high-  clusters form a homogeneous population which is brighter , and has a smaller scatter , than that of low-  clusters .",
    "this can be more clearly seen in figure  3 , which shows the scatter around the model predictions as a function of cluster x - ray  luminosity .",
    "it is this relationship between bcg and cluster properties that leads to the contradictory conclusions of cm98  and abk98 : out of the eleven @xmath5 clusters in the latter sample , nine have x - ray  flux measurements or upper limits , with all but two of these having a low x - ray  luminosity ( figure  1 ) .",
    "it is unsurprising that these clusters are not similar to rich , local clusters , as they were discovered on the basis of their optical properties (  castander  1994 ; holden  1997 ) .",
    "the squares in figure  2 represent the bcgs in the two @xmath17 clusters discussed by rosati  ( 1999 ) : the high-  cluster ( solid square ) was discovered by means of its x - ray  emission , whereas the low-  cluster ( open square ) was detected by its galaxy population .",
    "although based on only two points , this suggests that the correlation with environment holds at this redshift .",
    "the semi - analytic  models discussed in abk98  predict a factor of @xmath1845 increase in the stellar masses of bcgs in massive clusters since @xmath19 , for an einstein - de sitter universe . to test whether the data presented here supports this level of evolution ,",
    "a correlation between redshift and the bcg residuals ( @xmath20 ,  figure  4 ) has been sought .",
    "passive - evolution models with @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been used to calculate the residuals  since they provide a conservative range for the formation epoch of massive cluster ellipticals (  ellis  1997)and separate fits made to the high- and low-  cluster subsamples . since the form of any evolution is unknown a priori , a non - parametric rank - order statistic  kendall s @xmath23was used ; it also has the advantage that it is insensitive to the choice of normalisation adopted for the bruzual & charlot models .",
    "all save one of the fits showed no significant ( @xmath24 ) evidence for evolution ; the exception , at a significance of @xmath25 , was the high-  subsample with @xmath21 . to find the maximum formation epoch that is still compatible with evolution of the high-  subsample ,",

    "the lines show the expected locus of the residuals for the three models shown in figure  2 .    to quantify the amount of evolution allowed by the data , the same parametric form as employed by abk98namely @xmath28was used to estimate the growth in the stellar mass content of bcgs .",
    "fitting for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 indicates that , in the high-  sample ( which best approximates the cluster selection adopted for the semi - analytic  models ) , the typical bcg mass has increased by a factor of @xmath31 ( for @xmath21 ) or @xmath32 ( @xmath22 ) between @xmath19 and the present .",
    "these growth factors are substantially lower than either the factor of @xmath3345 predicted by the semi - analytic  models , or the measured values of 4.6 ( @xmath21 ) and 3.2 ( @xmath22 ) , of abk98 .",
    "the growth factor can also be estimated by fitting for @xmath29 alone if one assumes a low - redshift normalisation for the model predictions .",
    "however , this currently involves applying a color - correction to low - redshift optical bcg data , which introduces further uncertainty : applying a single @xmath34 correction to the x - ray - selected sample of lynam  ( 1999 )  changes the measured growth factor of the high-  sample by less than 20% , whilst using the normalisation adopted by abk98based on an optically - selected sample  increases the growth factor by 50% .",
    "k - band observations of the lynam  ( 1999 )   sample are being obtained to circumvent this problem in future work .",
    "the k - band luminosities of bcgs are correlated with their environment : clusters with a high x - ray  luminosity contain bcgs which are brighter , and have a smaller scatter , than those bcgs in clusters with a low x - ray  luminosity .",
    "the bcg evolution seen by abk98  has been shown to be an artifact of a selection bias in their cluster sample ; at high redshifts , their clusters are systematically less x - ray  luminous than their low - redshift sample , and so their bcgs are systematically fainter .    under the assumption of an einstein - de sitter universe ,",
    "non - parametric tests show that the only significant evidence for bcg mass evolution over the range @xmath35 occurs when the dominant stellar population formed relatively recently ( @xmath26 ) . using the same parametric form as abk98 ,",
    "the masses of bcgs in high-  clusters are found to have , at most , doubled since @xmath19 , compared to the factor of @xmath36 increase predicted , for bcgs in massive clusters , by the semi - analytic  models discussed by abk98 .",
