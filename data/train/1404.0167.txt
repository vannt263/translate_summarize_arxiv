    "force - driven translocation through a nanopore in a membrane is one of the fastest growing single - molecule manipulation technique @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of this highly nonequilibrium , transient process is mainly based on the tensile ( pincus ) blob picture and the notion of a propagating front of tensile force along the chain backbone @xcite . in order to simplify the analysis it was assumed @xcite that the moving portion of the chain on the _ cis _ side of the membrane ( moving domain ) could be characterized by an average time - dependent velocity @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the velocity of monomers is the same for every cross - section of the moving domain ; this approximation can therefore be referred to as an _ iso - velocity _ model .",
    "we have earlier pointed out @xcite the fact that this approximation , although violating the local material conservation law ( continuity equation ) , could still be used for the integral ( or global ) conservation law formulation ( see the appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "this then provides a way for a self - consistent calculation of the chain velocity @xmath2 which decreases as the tensile front propagates .",
    "moreover , the resulting scaling relationships for the mean translocation time is compatible with the corresponding result obtained on the basis of the so - called _ iso - flux _ model @xcite where the flux of monomers is constrained to be the same through every cross - section of the moving domain .",
    "in this paper we suggest a consistent generalization of the tensile force propagation model by taking into account the dynamical effects on the _ trans _ - side of the membrane where a strong crowding of monomer*s * can be seen @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the osmotic pressure caused by the crowding ( which could be quantified in terms of the de gennes concentration blobs @xcite ) leads to a counterbalance of the driving force acting in the pore and could result to a slowing down of the translocation process @xcite .",
    "recently the role of crowding has been investigated by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the so - called `` _ no trans _ '' model where a polymer bead is eliminated from the _ trans _ side as soon as a new bead arrives there @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such elimination has a very small impact on the translocation dynamics . moreover ,",
    "the role of the polymer - pore friction has been thoroughly studied @xcite using md - simulations as well as the brownian dynamics tension propagation ( bdtp ) model .",
    "it was demonstrated that this friction might be a reason for the nonuniversality of the mean translocation time @xmath3 scaling behavior .",
    "more precisely , the mean translocation time @xmath4 which is generally assumed to scale with chain length @xmath5 as @xmath6 with @xmath0 the translocation exponent , was shown to have a value @xmath0 that decreases with pore friction  @xcite .",
    "this of course translates in a dependence of @xmath0 on the pore size , since a smaller pore size correponds to a larger pore friction coefficient @xcite .",
    "based on the bdtp - model the finite chain effect and its impact on the exponent @xmath0 has been discussed in full details by ikonen _",
    "_ @xcite . as a result for the force - driven translocation ( i.e. for the case that the driving force @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the temperature , @xmath9 is the effective bond length and @xmath10 is the flory exponent @xcite ) for chain lengths @xmath5 which typically used in the simulation or experiments the translocation exponent @xmath0 satisfies the inequality @xmath11 , where the value @xmath12 corresponds to the value of @xmath0 in the absence of pore friction .",
    "we recall that for unbiased translocation ( i.e. translocation without an external driving force ) this exponent is much larger than @xmath12 namely @xmath13 @xcite ( see also appendix [ app_1 ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the tensile force propagation model by explicitly takes into account the dynamics on the _ trans _ - side ( crowding ) as well as the polymer - pore friction which affect the resulting force in the pore and leads to a more diverse translocation behavior . in doing",
    "so we treat the problem _ _ s__elf - consistently .",
    "that is , the _ _ e__ffective resulting force in the pore , @xmath14 , has an impact on the integral material balance of polymer segments . on the other hand ,",
    "force @xmath14 is affected by the dynamics on _ cis _ and _ trans _ sides in a reciprocal manner as it is discussed in sec .",
    "our approach extends the bdtp - model @xcite where the time - dependent friction coefficient of the _ cis _ side moving domain was taken from the tension - propagation ( tp ) model without crowding @xcite supplemented with the pore friction .    in sec .",
    "ii we derive the governing set of equations for this self - consistent translocation model based on the tensile blobs on the _ cis_-side and concentration blobs on the _ trans_-side picture . depending on driving force",
    "one can discriminate between the  trumpet , `` stem - flower '' and `` stem '' scenarios . in sec .",
    "iii we solve the resulting equations numerically and discuss in detail how the translocation exponent depends on driving force , pore friction and chain length .",
