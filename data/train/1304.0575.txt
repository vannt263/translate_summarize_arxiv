    "materials that are able to control and modify light propagation are very promising for photonic applications @xcite . among these ,",
    "photonic bandgap ( pbg ) crystals , which consist of materials having different dielectric constants arranged in a periodic structure @xcite , have been the subject of intensive research during the last few decades .",
    "pbg crystals can be fabricated by exploiting the self - assembly of polymers , block co - polymers , and colloidal particles into different morphologies@xcite . in pbg crystals formed by the self - assembly of colloidal particles ,",
    "the geometry of the particles has been envisioned as one of several possible factors that can modify , and possibly enhance , the optical properties of the materials @xcite .",
    "clearly , the colloidal particles used for this purpose should have specific and well defined shapes and low particle - size polydispersity @xcite . advances in new routes of synthesis have made possible the fabrication of such anisotropic particles in large quantities @xcite , so it has become possible to produce materials with specific properties by tailoring the individual particles .",
    "several examples of crystals formed by the self - assembly of anisotropic particles have been reported in the literature .",
    "dimers , formed by fusing two lobes of either equal ( symmetric ) or different ( asymmetric ) diameters , constitute one of the simplest geometries to model anisotropic colloids .",
    "pbg crystals formed by symmetric @xcite and asymmetric dimers @xcite have been reported .",
    "the theoretical pgb for this geometry has also been studied @xcite , showing that the optical properties of the material can change by modifying the symmetry and the degree of interpenetration of the lobes .",
    "the influence of particle shape on pbg has also been studied in a system consisting of spherical silica particles , whose shape can be modified into ellipsoids using ion radiation@xcite .",
    "assuming that the material of the particles before and after the radiation is not modified , the pbg was found to change as a consequence of the anisotropic shape and the lattice spacing of the new structure .    over the years",
    ", geometrical confinement of colloidal particles has been used as a method to control their self - assembly into well defined crystals structures @xcite .",
    "for example , in systems formed by spherical particles confined between two planar walls or in a wedge , a cascade of different phases is observed as a function of the degree of confinement .",
    "experiments @xcite and computer simulations @xcite of spherical particles concur that as the confinement is reduced ( i.e. as the separation between the confining planes is increased ) the crystal structures follow the sequence : @xmath10 , where the symbols @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 denote triangular , buckled , square , rhombic , and prismatic lattices , respectively ( see note in reference ) .",
    "similar research has been carried out by several groups for anisotropic particles , under conditions of strong confinement that approached or enacted a behavior in ( quasi- ) two dimensional geometry .",
    "examples of such experimental and computational investigations include studies of two - dimensional ( monolayer ) systems for hard dimers @xcite , hard spherocylinders @xcite , hard polygons @xcite , superdisks @xcite , and studies of systems confined between parallel walls for thin hard - rods @xcite and octapod - shaped colloids @xcite .",
    "recently , anisotropic particles whose shape resembles the form of a mushroom cap , have been the object of several recent studies @xcite .",
    "the cross section of an idealized model of these particles is show in figure [ figmodel](a ) .",
    "it has been observed experimentally that under strong confinement such mushroom cap - shaped particles exhibit the formation of the following sequence of crystal structures as the confinement is reduced @xcite : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes a side rotator hexagonal crystal phase , and the subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to the orientations of the particles in each layer ; the former describes lattices having all the particles oriented in the same direction , while the latter denotes random orientations of the particles .",
    "although the crystal lattices formed by mushroom cap - shaped and spherical particles might appear similar , important differences can be observed as a consequence of the orientation of the particles in the crystals . in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 crystal structures , for example",
    ", the particles in each layer are placed in a triangular lattice with random orientations that can be either dimple - up or dimple - down , while in the @xmath22 crystal phase a bifurcation in the particles orientation ( bpo ) is observed with the formation of alternating stripes of particles oriented dimple - up and dimple - down with either straight or zig - zag buckling .",
    "the bpo of the alternating stripes in the @xmath23 maximizes the packing of the crystal structure @xcite . as in the case of confined hard spheres ,",
    "the @xmath22 transforms into a @xmath24 crystal phase showing also a bpo as the confinement is decreased . in both @xmath22 and @xmath24",
    "the orientation of the particles in each layer is such that the dimples always face towards the walls . in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 rotator crystal phases , the particles in each layer",
    "are placed in a triangular lattice with the particles rotating in their lattice positions , but keeping the dimples mostly oriented parallel to the walls . as a consequence of the orientation and shape of the particles in the @xmath25 phase ,",
    "the hexagonal order is weaker than that in @xmath11 phases .",
    "recently , the same group studied the self - assembly of similar mushroom - cap shaped particles synthesized using seed emulsion polymerization @xcite .",
    "the phase behavior of the new particles was found to be slightly different from that previously reported @xcite , in particular , in the buckled monolayer @xmath27 the particles were now mainly oriented parallel to the walls , and in the square bilayer @xmath28 the particles in the bottom layer were oriented parallel to the walls while the particles in the upper layer are dimple - up oriented .",
    "these results suggest that the phases formed by the particles are sensitive to the shape of the particles and , possibly , kinetic traps near metastable states .",
    "computer simulation can be used to systematically study the effect of particle shape , particularly of orientational degrees of freedom , on the self - assembly and phase behavior of anisotropic particles .",
    "simulation studies of anisotropic particles having curved surface area have mostly focused on bulk behavior .",
    "for example , cinnacchi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , reported the bulk phase behavior of contact lens - like particles using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . for large values of the radius of curvature , approaching the limit of infinitely thin hard platelets",
    ", the system exhibits the formation of a nematic phase at high densities , consistent with the phase behavior of hard platelets @xcite , while for small values of the radius of curvature the system shows the formation of clusters with spherical - like shape . the phase behavior of bowl - shaped particles ( a shape intended to model experimental colloidal particles concurrently studied @xcite ) has also been reported based on mc simulations and free energy calculations @xcite .",
    "simulations of the bowl - shaped model reveal the formation of several crystal and liquid crystal structures depending on the thickness of the bowls which ranged from thin hard - bowls to hard - hemispheres .",
    "in this work , we present the phase behavior of an idealized model of mushroom - cap shaped colloidal particles , which are modelled as spherical caps interacting only via excluded volume , and confined between two parallel hard walls . using this model",
    "we address the effect of particle shape ( as the fraction of curved surface area varies ) on the self - assembly and phase behavior for conditions of strong confinement .",
    "specifically , our study encompasses three different hard - core particle shapes : ( a ) three - quarter height spherical caps , ( b ) one - half spherical caps ( hemispheres ) , and ( c ) one - quarter height spherical caps the rest of the paper is organized as follow : in section ii the simulation model is presented , in section iii the results for the three different particles shapes , including some general remarks are described . in section",
    "iv the main conclusion are summarized , followed by an appendix where a summary of the simulation techniques are described , including the algorithm to determine particle - particle and particle - wall overlaps .",
    "the particle model consists of spherical caps ( sc ) , that is , hard spheres of diameter @xmath1 cut - off by a plane at a height @xmath2 . particles",
    "only experience excluded volume interactions and are confined between two parallel hard walls separated by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "a schematic representation of the cross section of the particles is depicted in figure [ figmodel](b ) .",
    "the particle model is fully characterized by its reduced height ( aspect ratio ) @xmath3 , and its orientation is completely described by the unit vector @xmath29 along the principal axis of symmetry . note that @xmath30 is also equal to the _ spherical surface fraction _ defined as the ratio of the curved surface area of the particle to the surface area of the complete sphere , while @xmath31 is the ratio of flat to curved surface areas . in order to address the effect of @xmath30 on the phase behavior of the system , three different values of the aspect ratio @xmath30 are analysed : ( a ) three - quarter height sc ( @xmath6 ) , ( b ) one - half height sc or hemispheres ( @xmath7 ) , and ( c ) one - quarter height sc ( @xmath8 ) . throughout this work ,",
    "structural and thermodynamic properties are reported in reduced units , where the pressure , packing fraction , and separation between the walls are given by : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the pressure , @xmath36 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath37 is the absolute temperature , @xmath38 is the total number of particles , @xmath39 represents the volume of one particle , and @xmath40 is the total volume of the system .",
    "details of the simulation techniques used to calculate the phase behavior of sc are presented in the appendix .",
    "the phase diagram for sc with @xmath6 under confinement is shown in figure [ phase075 ] .",
    "the phase behavior for this system is richer that the one displayed by confined hard - spheres @xcite . for the highest possible confinements , corresponding to @xmath42 ( the upper limit corresponds to @xmath43 )",
    ", the particles translate in a quasi - two dimensional fashion adopting only two possible orientations : either face - up or face - down .",
    "the first two stable phases observed at these conditions are a buckled monolayer @xmath22 with bpo and a random orientated hexagonal monolayer @xmath20 .",
    "representative configurations are shown in figures [ snap075](a - b ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , confined hard spheres also exhibit the formation of buckled and hexagonal monolayers , however , the main difference is that sc can adopt several orientations depending of the degree of confinement .    for @xmath44",
    ", high - density systems exhibit the formation of a dimer phase @xmath45 , in which the particles orient parallel to the walls pairing up in dimers that can take on several configurations @xcite . in figure",
    "[ snap075](c ) one of the dimer crystal phases with a herringbone configuration is shown . upon expansion",
    "the @xmath45 crystal melts into a fluid side phase monolayer @xmath25 in which the particles remain oriented mainly parallel to the walls . for @xmath46 ( a confinement corresponding to hard walls separated by a distance @xmath47 ) , the system exhibits a re - entrant hexagonal ordering behavior upon lowering the concentration :",
    "the hexagonal order first drops ( forming a @xmath25 phase ) , then climbs up and finally drops down again .",
    "while the @xmath48 phase occurs for @xmath49 , the hexagonal- order re - entrant behavior is only apparent for @xmath50 values near 1.35 . the phase behavior at these conditions is shown in figure [ sidep ] , where the equation of state ( eos ) and hexagonal order parameter @xmath51 are plotted as a function of the packing fraction @xmath52 .",
    "the only discontinuity observed in the eos is for the @xmath53 transition .",
    "the low - density branch of the eos , that encompasses the @xmath25 phase , decreases monotonically showing no evidence of additional phase transitions .",
    "however , figure [ sidep](b ) reveals that for @xmath46 a peak in hexagonal order occurs that spans @xmath54 . for these states ,",
    "very long runs were carried out to rule out the possibility of artifacts due to slow relaxation and mobility ; also , additional compression runs started from an isotropic state reproduced the same re - entrant behavior .    to explore the correlation between side orientation and hexagonal order , the fraction of particles oriented parallel to the walls @xmath55 is shown in figure [ sidep](c ) .",
    "a particle @xmath56 was considered to be oriented parallel to the wall if @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the unit vector perpendicular to the walls ; this angle ensures that the rim of the sc curved surface faces the walls .",
    "it can be observed in figure [ sidep](c ) that for @xmath49 the fraction of particles side - oriented decreases when the system expands .",
    "figure [ sfactor ] shows snapshots and corresponding two - dimensional structure factors @xmath59 for @xmath46 in the @xmath54 range ; it is observed that when most particles remain oriented parallel to the walls ( e.g. , at @xmath60 ) the resulting anisotropic shape presented for particle - particle interactions frustrates the establishment of hexagonal order , while when about half particles orient perpendicularly to the walls , they effectively interact as spheres which can enhance the hexagonal order if the volume fraction is sufficiently high .",
    "it is then a combination of high volume fraction and low enough @xmath55 that promote hexagonal order .",
    "the peak - behavior ( and strong fluctuations ) in @xmath51 values observed in the re - entrant region for @xmath46 can be explained by its proximity to the @xmath20 phase that occurs ( in the same @xmath52 range ) for @xmath50 just below @xmath61 ( see figure [ phase075 ] ) ; indeed , re - entrant states around @xmath46 could be considered to still be `` part '' of the @xmath20 phase domain .",
    "of course , hexagonal order gets accentuated once @xmath50 is not large enough ( @xmath62 ) to accommodate side orientations hence leading to smaller @xmath55 values .",
    "re - entrant behavior notwithstanding , it is also difficult to pinpoint the limits of stability of the @xmath25 phase , but an approximate phase boundary can be sketched based on the @xmath55 vs. density plot ( see figure [ sidep](c ) ) .",
    "a threshold of @xmath63 is used to draw the approximate phase boundary represented by thick dashed lines in figures [ phase075 ] and [ sidep ] .",
    "when the confinement is decreased , the @xmath45 phase transforms into a square bilayer @xmath24 .",
    "this @xmath64 transformation seems to occurs with a @xmath65 intermediate , which is formed by the separation of some of the dimers in the @xmath45 phase , and their reorientation to face toward the walls ( see figure [ snap075](e ) ) . as in the case of confined hard spheres ,",
    "the @xmath24 phase transforms into a @xmath66 mediated by a rhombic phase @xmath67 .",
    "likewise @xmath22 , these three phases show bpo .",
    "as @xmath50 increases at intermediate densities , the @xmath66 transforms continuously into a hexagonal bilayer with random particle orientations @xmath21 , which then transforms into a hexagonal bilayer @xmath26 with particles acquiring orientations parallel to the walls .",
    "these three phases are shown in figures [ snap075](g - i ) .",
    "this sequence of transformations @xmath68 seems to occur continuously as no signs of first - order transitions were observed during the simulations .    at high densities",
    ", the @xmath66 phase transforms into a dense dimer side bilayer @xmath69 structure ( shown in figure [ snap075](l ) ) as @xmath50 is increased .",
    "the @xmath70 transformation seems to occur through two intermediaries @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are shown in figures [ snap075](j - k ) . in the @xmath71",
    "phase the dimers are intercalated between stripes formed by particles with opposite orientations facing toward the confining walls . in the second intermediary structure @xmath72 , the particles forming the dimer in the @xmath71 detach and reorient to adopt a side configuration , while the particles facing toward the confining walls ( in @xmath71 ) remain in a similar configuration .",
    "finally , the particles that were facing the walls reorient to form the @xmath69 structure . upon expansion at constant confinement @xmath50 ,",
    "the @xmath71 and @xmath72 structures transform into a @xmath21 phase , while the @xmath69 crystal transforms into a @xmath26 phase .",
    "these transformation are marked in figure [ hex ] , where the equation of state , bond order parameters @xmath73 and @xmath51 , and fraction of particles oriented parallel to the walls @xmath55 are shown for three different confinements : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the densest crystal structures for each of these confinements are @xmath66 , @xmath77 , and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the transformation observed upon expansion are : @xmath78 for @xmath74 ( figure [ hex](a ) ) , @xmath79 for @xmath75 ( figure [ hex](b ) ) , and @xmath80 for @xmath76 ( figure [ hex](c ) ) .",
    "the three structures @xmath66 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 show large values of the bond order parameter @xmath51 revealing their hexagonal order .",
    "however , the @xmath55 profiles are different for each of the confinements . for the @xmath74 and @xmath81",
    ", @xmath55 vanishes indicating that there is a bpo in the structure ( see figure [ snap075](g ) ) ; however , @xmath55 increases once that the fluid region has been reached . for the @xmath75 system",
    "the @xmath55 profile shows that approximately half of the particles are oriented parallel to the walls , confirming that in the hexagonal structures @xmath21 particles have random orientations as shown in figure [ snap075](h ) .",
    "note that while in the @xmath20 phase the particles can take only face - up or face - down orientations , in the @xmath21 they can adopt any possible orientation .",
    "finally , in the @xmath76 system most of the particles are oriented parallel to the walls , as revealed by the large values of @xmath55 , confirming the existence of the @xmath26 phase .",
    "it can also be observed that both the @xmath21 and @xmath26 phases show moderate values of the order parameter @xmath51 , while the @xmath66 phase exhibits larger values for this parameter .",
    "this effect is mainly caused by the particles oriented parallel to the wall perturbing the hexagonal order @xcite .",
    "the sc model with @xmath6 presented in this section resembles closely the shape of the mushroom cap - shaped particles reported in reference .",
    "the comparison of the structures formed by such sc with those found experimentally reveals that the model is appropriate to describe the phase behavior of the real system .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , mushroom cap - shaped particles reported in references and exhibit the following crystal sequence : @xmath82 ( or @xmath83 ) @xmath84 ( or @xmath28 ) @xmath85 .",
    "our model of sc with @xmath6 encounters the sequence @xmath86 for the horizontal band of packing fractions between @xmath87 in figure [ phase075 ] , suggesting that the crystal structures in references and are in equilibrium .",
    "figure [ experimental ] shows the experimental structures for @xmath20 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath24 , @xmath21 , and @xmath90 formed by mushroom caps , revealing good agreement with those found in simulation ( see fig .",
    "[ snap075 ] ) with one exception : in the experimental buckled monolayer @xmath27 the particles orient with the dimples parallel to the walls , while in the simulated @xmath91 the particles orient perpendicular to the walls .",
    "moreover , the simulations reveal six additional phases that have not been observed in experiments , most of which occur at higher densities and whose structure may not be accessible to experiments due to kinetic trapping . indeed , the phases observed experimentally appear to be the first ordered structures encountered in our phase diagram ( for a given @xmath50 ) while going up in concentration .",
    "it is remarked , however , that the boundaries of the simulated phases are only approximate and ( non - trivial ) free energy calculation would be needed to refine them and to determine the stability of the additional phases .",
    "the phase diagram of confined sc with aspect ratio @xmath7 , corresponding to hard hemispheres , is depicted in figure [ phase050 ] . as in the previous case ,",
    "the first stable crystal structures observed for this system is a @xmath22 phase , which is now stable for @xmath93 . over a very small region in the phase diagram , it is also observed the formation of a random hexagonal monolayer @xmath20 , characterized by random face - up and face - down orientations of the particles .",
    "as in the case of sc with @xmath6 , this system exhibits the formation of three bilayer structures @xmath24 , @xmath67 , and @xmath94 . in figure [ snap050 ] representative snapshots for these phases are presented . for high densities and @xmath95 , which correspond to wall separations larger than the diameter of the particles ,",
    "a rectangular plastic bilayer phase @xmath96 is formed , which is characterized by alternating arrays of face - to - face sphere - like dimers , and column - like dimers . at high densities",
    "the orientations of the sphere - like dimers are frozen as shown in figure [ snap050](e ) ; however , when the system is expanded the dimers start to freely rotate around their centres of mass as in a plastic rotator phase as seen in figure [ snap050](f ) .",
    "the @xmath97 phase resembles the @xmath98 structure seen for @xmath6 , in which the dimers are intercalated between stripes formed by particles with opposite orientations facing towards the confining wall .",
    "however , in the @xmath98 structure the dimers can not rotate as in the case of hemispheres .",
    "the @xmath99 phase also resembles the face - centered cubic rotator phase formed by hard - hemispheres at bulk conditions @xcite .",
    "the phase behavior of hard hemispheres suggest that the stabilization of hexagonal monolayers over large densities and strong confinement is attained only for systems comprised of particles with large spherical surface fraction or @xmath30 .",
    "this effect can be explained using figure [ buckledphase ] and the following geometrical arguments .",
    "if @xmath30 is increased , the sc bases ( capping discs ) are pushed apart making the monolayers more stable ( see figure [ buckledphase](b ) ) . in this case",
    ", the distance @xmath100 between circumferences of nearest discs in alternating stripes increases and the contact angle @xmath101 between nearest particles in adjacent stripes reduces : the limit values for a perfect monolayer are @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "likewise , it is expected that in sc with @xmath104 under strong confinement , the bases of nearest particles in alternating stripes can come closer increasing the stability of bilayers over that of monolayers .",
    "in particular , it is expected that for infinitely thin spherical caps ( @xmath5 ) the system would form bilayers directly without being preceded by monolayers .",
    "the same arguments also suggest that the stability of the buckled phase should be reduced as @xmath105 .",
    "these trends are consistent with the results presented in the following subsection for @xmath106 particles .",
    "the phase diagram for sc particles with @xmath8 under different confinements , shown in figure [ phase025 ] , is simpler than those of the other two particle shapes considered in this work . as in the two previous cases , the first crystal phase observed for this system at high densities and strong confinement",
    "is the buckled monolayer @xmath22 .",
    "however , this phase is only observed over a very small region of the phase diagram : @xmath108 and at high densities .",
    "this behavior is different from the one observed in confined hard spheres and in the previously described sc with @xmath7 and @xmath6 , where the buckled phases are stable over a wide range of densities and confinements . as a consequence of the small degree of buckling , at high densities the @xmath22 phase shows either straight or zig - zag stripes @xcite . in further contrast with hard spheres , sc particles with @xmath109",
    "do not exhibit the formation of an hexagonal monolayer , which confirms the destabilization of monolayers for small @xmath2 as discussed before in reference to figure [ buckledphase ] .",
    "the small island of @xmath22 observed in figure [ phase025 ] is expected to get reduced if @xmath30 is further decreased . for @xmath110",
    "the most stable crystal phases observed are the @xmath24 and @xmath66 structures and , as in the case of the previous systems , the phase transition @xmath111 is through a rhombic bilayer @xmath67 intermediary .",
    "all these bilayer structures , as in the previous cases , also exhibit a bpo in such a way that the base of the sc always face towards the confining walls , allowing them to pack efficiently .",
    "representative snapshots for the @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath67 , and @xmath66 phases are shown in figure [ snap025 ] .",
    "for @xmath112 the system shows an abrupt change in phase behavior where the number of layers increases from two to four and the structure adopts a square symmetry ( @xmath113 ) . in the @xmath113",
    "phase the two middle layers can either align to form dimers as in figure [ snap025](e ) or overlay halfway as in figure [ snap025](f ) . in this region , it is difficult to pinpoint which crystal structure corresponds to a particular confinement unequivocally . as in the case of the bilayer structures , the @xmath113 if formed by alternating layer of particles with same orientations , with the outer layers having only particles oriented facing towards the walls .",
    "our results are summarized in the qualitative @xmath30 vs. @xmath50 phase diagram presented in figure [ global ] for the main ordered phases and the @xmath114 range only ; they are presented in the context of the results of the confined hard - sphere system ( @xmath115 ) from reference .",
    "note that hard spheres particles no longer have an orientational degree of freedom and hence the phase @xmath20 simply becomes @xmath116 , @xmath22 becomes @xmath117 @xcite ( denoted as @xmath118 and i1 in reference ) , @xmath67 becomes @xmath119 , @xmath24 becomes @xmath120 , and phases @xmath66 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 fuse into @xmath94 .",
    "the following trends can be observed :    * two phases that occur in all cases are the bilayers @xmath24 and @xmath66 , which are mediated , at very high densities only , by the also common phase @xmath67 .",
    "the lower @xmath50 bound in the range where the @xmath24 occurs tends to shift to higher values as @xmath30 increases , while its upper bound remains almost unchanged ( at @xmath121 ) . * for @xmath122 ,",
    "as @xmath30 increases the @xmath24 phase gives way to the triangular monolayer @xmath20 ( or @xmath116 for @xmath115 ) .",
    "this process seems to always be mediated at high densities by the buckled phase @xmath22 ( or @xmath117 for @xmath115 ) .",
    "it appears that the @xmath25 and @xmath45 monolayers observed for @xmath6 system merge into the @xmath116 and the @xmath117 , respectively , as @xmath30 approaches 1 .",
    "* for @xmath123 , the @xmath113 phase seen at @xmath8 with dimer formation ( see figure [ snap025](e ) ) appears to be the precursor of the @xmath97 phase observed for @xmath7 , which in turn would be the precursor of the @xmath98 phase observed for @xmath6 , which ( together with @xmath124 and at high densities only ) would give way to the @xmath125 phase observed for @xmath115 .",
    "for intermediate densities , the @xmath21 phase observed for @xmath6 likely originates from the @xmath66 phase already occurring for @xmath7 ; finally , the @xmath66 and @xmath21 seen for @xmath6 merge into @xmath94 phase as @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath66 phases are readily rationalized based on considerations of ordered packing of particles that ( due to confinement ) interact laterally with their rounded peripheries .",
    "the absence of a @xmath20 monolayer for the @xmath8 case occurs because even for @xmath126 the system can accommodate two layers ( @xmath24 ) by the alternating flipping of particle orientations .",
    "the @xmath22 phase can be seen as the best packing of particles at high densities when the system confinement is such that neither a monolayer nor a bilayer would fit well .",
    "likewise , the @xmath113 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98-@xmath124 phases can be seen as variants of a common motif ( where an intermediate layer made of `` dimers '' is sandwiched between two monolayers facing toward the walls ) that occurs as the system tries to pack densely when the confinement ( @xmath123 ) is such that neither bilayers nor higher multilayer arrangements would work well .",
    "the phase behavior for sc under strong confinement inside a slit has been mapped out using mc simulations . depending on the particle aspect ratio and concentration , different ordered structures have been observed .",
    "the system comprising of sc with @xmath8 forms stable bilayers with square and triangular symmetry , and four - layer structures with square symmetry .",
    "these systems do not exhibit the formation of stable monolayers , with the exception of a very small region where a buckled monolayer is observed .",
    "the stabilization of the monolayers is only observed when the spherical surface fraction of the particles @xmath30 is increased . indeed , stable buckled monolayers are observed over a wide range of densities for sc with @xmath7 ( hemispheres ) and @xmath6 , while stable random hexagonal monolayers are only observed for the system with @xmath6 .",
    "a common feature of the three particle shapes studied is that for confinements where the particles can fully rotate , the system tends to form dimers to maximize the packing of the structures .",
    "the progression of phases resulting from changes in confinement and particle aspect ratio , can be traced and fully integrated in a global phase diagram ( figure [ global ] ) , which further provides a seamless connection to the known phase behavior of confined hard spheres .",
    "the system of sc with @xmath6 shows a phase behavior similar to the one found experimentally for mushroom cap - shaped particles reported in reference , including the formation of mono and bilayers with particles having orientations parallel to the walls ( side phases ) .",
    "the formation of these structures is only possible when the particles have a shape close to spherical .",
    "the sequence of structures observed for this system is : @xmath127 .",
    "our study reveals that such sc can form other structures ( at higher densities ) that have not been observed in experiments yet .",
    "some of the phase boundaries are difficult to pinpoint , and future free energy calculations can help elucidate more completely the phase diagram for these systems , and the stability of some of the structures .",
    "attempts to obtain the structures by compression runs have met with partial success only , revealing the presence of potential kinetic traps .",
    "elucidating the kinetics of some of these order - disorder phase transitions using specialized simulation techniques is part of our ongoing efforts .",
    "the phase diagrams for each particle shape are obtained using mc simulations , and consist of two stages .",
    "the first stage corresponds to the prediction of the densest crystal structures for each pair of parameter values ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the second stage consists of expansion runs ( in the isobaric - isothermal ensemble ) from the crystal structures obtained in the previous stage , and analysing the different structures observed in the system to assign their phase identity .",
    "the calculation of the crystal structures is carried out using the so - called floppy - box monte carlo algorithm @xcite . in this method",
    ", systems comprised of a small number of particles are simulated using isothermal - isobaric ( @xmath129 ) ensemble mc runs , allowing the area and shape of the box in the @xmath130-@xmath131 plane to change , keeping the height @xmath50 along the @xmath132-direction constant @xcite .",
    "the methodology entails first the generation of a low density configuration , with particles in random positions and orientations .",
    "the system is then equilibrated at the pressure of @xmath133 , and subsequently compressed in steps of @xmath134 until the a value of @xmath135 is reached , and subsequent values increased by a factor of 10 until a value of @xmath136 is reached . in some systems , the compression between @xmath135 and 100 was carried out using steps of @xmath137 , to allow more time for the particles to reorganize , which is particularly important for confinements close to the boundaries between different crystal phases .",
    "the need of a gradual compression was also pointed out in reference for the study of the crystal structures of hard - hemispheres at bulk conditions .",
    "a set of 50 to 100 of such compressions with different initial configurations are performed , and the last configuration in each compression series is recorded for post - processing analysis .",
    "several system sizes were tested in order to ensure that the crystal structures are not affected by an insufficient number of particles during the calculation , however it was observed that using at least 4 particles per layer was enough to obtain reliable results : larger systems ( more particles per layer ) show similar structures as those with system of 4 particles per layer . in the post - processing analysis",
    "several order parameters were used to characterize the crystal phases .",
    "the symmetry of each layer is obtained using bond order parameters , defined as : @xmath138 , for @xmath1394 , 6 , and , 8 , where @xmath140 is the angle made by the bond between particles @xmath141 and its nearest neighbor with respect to an arbitrary axis , and @xmath142 is the total number of nearest neighbors of particle @xmath141 .",
    "the calculation of the nearest neighbors is carried out using the voronoi tesselation @xcite , except for the case @xmath143 , where only the four closest neighbors are used .",
    "the reason of this is to avoid the well - known problem of degeneracy in the voronoi tessalation in square lattices .",
    "the square symmetry is easily characterized using the order parameters @xmath144 taking into account all the nearest neighbors @xcite ; however @xmath73 , calculated with the above definition , in combination with @xmath51 are useful to characterize layers with rhombic ( oblique ) and rectangular symmetries . in addition , the following angular order parameters were calculated : @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the angle between the orientation of particles @xmath148 and the main director . the main director of the system is obtained from the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of the so - called saupe tensor defined as : @xmath149 , with @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "the order parameters @xmath151 and @xmath152 are useful to determine whether or not a system shows a bifurcation in the particles orientation .",
    "for example @xmath152 allows to distinguish between @xmath66 ( large values of @xmath152 ) and @xmath21 ( low or moderate values of @xmath152 ) .",
    "the structures showing the higher order , measured by the aforementioned order parameters , are selected as the crystal structures , which in most of the cases also correspond to the densest structures .",
    "however , non - trivial free energy calculations may be required to unambiguously determine the most stable crystal structures for each confinement , especially to pinpoint the boundaries between different phase domains .",
    "once the crystal structures are determined , we proceed to perform expansion runs to obtain the phase diagram for each particle shape and confinement . as in the previous calculation ,",
    "the expansion runs were carried out using @xmath129 mc simulations . during the simulations involving ordered structures",
    "the shape of the box is allowed to change , keeping the values of @xmath50 constant .",
    "the number of particles @xmath38 used for each system range between 600 and 700 .",
    "the system is started at high pressures and subsequently expanded until the system is completely isotropic .",
    "one mc cycle is defined as @xmath38 moves consisting of translation moves , rotations and inversions of the particle orientations , as well as changes of the volume and/or shape of the system box .",
    "each move is randomly selected using the following probabilities : 35% of translation moves , 35% of rotations , 25% of orientation flips , and 5% of volume change ( 50% of which correspond to isotropic changes and 50% for simultaneous changes of the volume and shape of the simulation box ) . for each state",
    ", @xmath153 mc cycles are used to equilibrate the system , and additional @xmath154 cycles , divided in 10 blocks , are used to collect ensemble averages and estimate uncertainties . once the equilibration run for a specific state",
    "is finished , that configuration is used as a starting point for the next run at a different pressure .",
    "the location of phase transitions are identified based on discontinuities and inflexion points found in the equation of state , and in the order parameters previously defined .",
    "the heart of the mc simulation program is the algorithm to check for the particle - particle and particle - wall overlaps . to perform these tests ,",
    "each particle is modeled as a void sc ( bowl ) capped with a circular disc , thus the particle - particle overlap algorithm consists of three elementary tests : bowl - bowl @xcite , disc - disc @xcite , and bowl - disc .",
    "the particle - wall algorithm can also be separated in two elementary tests : bowl - wall and disc - wall .",
