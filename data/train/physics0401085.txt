    "alice ( a large ion collider experiment ) has a dedicated detector systems to study the collective properties of the hot and dense matter created in nucleus - nucleus collisions using the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the year @xmath9 .",
    "the alice detectors will measure and identify mid - rapidity hadrons , leptons and photons produced in the interactions @xcite .",
    "the design parameters of the alice detectors are optimized to cope with multiplicities up to @xmath10 charged particles per unity rapidity ( the theoretical prediction of @xmath11 at mid - rapidity for pbpb collison at @xmath12 a tev may lie between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , resulting in @xmath15 charged primary and secondary tracks in the acceptance of the central detector systems that covers mid - rapidity @xmath16 and full azimuth .",
    "based on current physics simulations , the central event size in pb - pb interaction is expected to be about @xmath17 mb before compression out of which about @xmath18 mb of raw data is generated by the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , which is the main tracking device of the alice detector ( a brief description of the alice detector systems is given in the appendix and also can be found in alice ppr @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "several data compression algorithms have been tried on simulated tpc data @xcite . using huffman compression and an optimized frequency distributioni",
    "we have also shown that it is possible to achieve a lossless compression ratio of @xmath19 on the realistic tpc rawdata that includes read out overheads @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the total bandwidth needed for the data transfer requires evaluation of the rawdata throughput for each type of trigger .",
    "the number of events required to accumulate enough statistics in one year period of data taking ( which has an effective time of @xmath20 ) is a few @xmath21 events for hadronic physics , a few @xmath22 events for minimum bias , hadronic charm and electron physics and at least @xmath23 for dimuon physics .",
    "the needed rates are then of the order of a few hz for hadronic physics , a few tens of hz for minimum bias , hadronic charm and elctrons and a few hundreds of hz for dimuons for the l2 triggers . at",
    "a read out frequency of @xmath24 hz , a total band width of @xmath25 gb / s coming out of the detector has to be handled ( this rate roughly coincides with the tpc limitation , the minimum bias rate ( assuming @xmath26 barn total cross section ) for pbpb collison is @xmath26 khz out of which @xmath27 khz may be considered as central events . at this event rate , ( @xmath28 events / s ) , and with drift time @xmath29 , the fraction of pbpb double events in the tpc is @xmath30=0.76 $ ] , where @xmath31 accounts for the past and present memory of the tpc .",
    "the clean minimum bias pbpb events thus reduces to about @xmath32 hz and the central rate to about @xmath33 hz . ] ) .",
    "thus , the amount of data which needs to be written to mass storage will be about a few pbytes per year .",
    "one of the major objective of the alice experiment is to measure rare processes such as jet transverse energy spectra up to @xmath34 gev and the pattern of medium induced modifications of charmonium and bottomium bound states .",
    "these low cross section rare events ( which range down to one in @xmath22 pp and to one in @xmath35 pbpb events ) , require full exploitation of all the available luminosity in order to attain the desired event statistics and will generate data volume which will far exceed what can be tarnsferred to the permanent storage system .",
    "alice would not be able to acquire sufficient statistics for many rare probes without rejecting many unwanted events by sharpening the momentum cut through a high level trigger ( hlt ) mechanism .",
    "therefore , the hlt system is one of the important aspect of the alice detectors which controls the data flow between the front end electronics of the detectors and the event builder of the data acquisition system . using simulated rawdata ,",
    "all the present hlt studies examine the possibility of having a fast cluster finder ( using techniques like hough transformation etc ) leading to a fast pattern recognition algorithm primarily for the tracks in the tpc sectors @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider the possibility of generating a high @xmath0 trigger using the hit informations only from the its sectors of the alice detectors where all high @xmath0 charged particle tarjectories are mostly linear .",
    "as will be shown later , using a simple road - finder algorithm based on a narrow ( @xmath2 ) search window , it has been possible to reject significant amount of low @xmath0 backgrounds .",
    "it has been possible to extract the momentum of these tracklets through a @xmath36 minimization procedure which agree well ( within @xmath37 ) with the actual momentum .",
    "the computation is also fast enough as the track density is very low within a small @xmath38 bin of @xmath39 radian , thus reducing the number of combinatorics .",
    "further , it is found that with proper choice of the input track co - ordiates ( a track is represented by a 12-dimensional hit vector in @xmath40 space ) , a principal component transformation can be carried out which leads to a parametric space with only two independent variables when the track momentum becomes large so that all the trajectories are nearly linear .",
    "this aspect has been utilised further to reject the false tracks particularly when the track density is very high .",
    "it is shown in this work that this simple road finder with a pca or ica cut can be used to reject low momentum tracks and select @xmath41 gev quite efficiently with less computational efforts .",
    "this has been demonstrated using hijing generator with jet options @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the extracted momentum is close to the true value within @xmath37 , it can also be used as a seed finder for high @xmath0 tracks which can be further prolonged into the tpc using kalman filter technique or even , its as a stand - alone detector , can also be used to know the origin of a high @xmath0 track which might otherwsise gets lost in the tpc - trd dead zones .",
    "the inner tracking system ( its ) consists of @xmath6 cylindrical layers of silicon detectors , located at radii , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 cm .",
    "it covers the rapidity range of @xmath48 for all vertices located within the length of the interaction diamond @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 cm along the beam direction .",
    "the number , position and segmentation of the layers are optimized for efficient track finding and high impact parameter resolution . in particular , the outer radius is determined by the necessity to match tracks with those from the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , and the inner radius is the minimum allowed by the radius of the beam pipe ( @xmath51 cm ) .",
    "the first layer has a more extended coverage @xmath52 to provide , together with the forward multiplicity detector ( fmd ) , a continuous coverage in rapidity for the measurement of charged particles multiplicity .",
    "because of high particle density , pixel detectors have been chosen for the inner most two layers , and silicon drift detectors for the following two layers .",
    "the outer two layers have double sided silicon microstrip detectors . with the exception of inner most pixel layers",
    ", all others layers will also provide energy loss information in the non - relativistic region .",
    "thus , the its has a stand - alone capability as a low @xmath0 particle spectrometer .",
    "the simulation is carried out using aliroot , the standard alice simulation and reconstruction package based on the root object oriented data analysis framework @xcite .",
    "we use hijing generator for background simulation .",
    "although , analysis is confined only to the its sector , we include all the alice detectors and passive materials in aliroot simulation with the option of magnetic filed @xmath53 in the solenoidal region . in the present work",
    ", we use a fast simulator to get reconstructed points ( recpoints ) from the hits .",
    "we also neglect the vertx smearing and set vertices to @xmath54 for all the tracks in the aliroot simulation .",
    "we consider only those tracks which have hits in all the six its layers . to minimize the dispersion , we begin with all the reconstructed points in the @xmath55 layer with a given ( @xmath40 ) and look for the corresponding points in the remaining five layers within a search window of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 co - ordinate in the @xmath55 layer is considered to be the seed for a good track candidate if it has entries in all the follwing and subsequent layers within that search window .",
    "therefore , the efficiency ( @xmath59 ) is defined as the ratio of good tracks ( as defined above ) divided by the total number of seeds or the reconstructed points in the @xmath55 layer . since , we have considered only those tracks which have entries in all six layers , the total number of rec - points in the @xmath55 layer also corresponds to the total number of tracks or trcaklets that pass through the its .",
    "figure 1 shows the efficiency @xmath59 as a function of @xmath60 bin width for different @xmath0 . as can be seen from the figure , at a bin width of @xmath39 radian , it is possible to reject most of the low @xmath0 tracks below @xmath61 or @xmath62 gev . for this plot ,",
    "we have considered only @xmath13 charged pions generated randomly at a fixed @xmath0 within the full its acceptance . we have also taken @xmath63 , although the spread in @xmath4 direction is slightly smaller than the @xmath5 dispersion and can be optimized further .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath64 only increases the number of combinatorics marginally and does not affect the analysis . within this",
    "( @xmath2 ) window , we consider all the combinatorics and extract the radius of curvature ( @xmath65 ) by a simple curvature fitting and by accepting the one for which the @xmath36 is minimum . finally , we estimated the momentum ( in gev ) from the relation @xmath66 .    to see",
    "how well we can reconstruct the transverse momentum by only a @xmath36 minimization , we generate charged pions between @xmath67 to @xmath68 gev . however , this time , we chose @xmath69 , but restrict to only @xmath70 over full azimuth so that the data volume is not too high and also the number of primaries chosen corresponds to @xmath71 . if the fitted value of @xmath0 is within @xmath37 of the true @xmath0 , we consider the estimate as true . otherwise , it is a false estimate although the estimated @xmath36 is still a minimum .",
    "figure 2 shows the plot of number of true and false tracks as defined above as a function of @xmath0 for three different bin widths of @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 radians respectively .",
    "although the original @xmath0 distribution is uniform , the extracted momentum distribution shows non - uniformity due to poor momentum resolution .",
    "note that for @xmath75 gev , the contribution of the false tracks remain below @xmath76 .",
    "however , it is not possible to extract @xmath0 below @xmath1 gev as the false estimate increases sharply particularly when bin width increases .",
    "it is also noticed that the contributions of the true estimates depend on the bin width to some extent . for larger bin width , the contribution of the true estimate decrases while the false estimate goes up at low momentum below @xmath77 gev .",
    "similarly , if the bin width is too small , some of the high @xmath0 tracks may get rejected .",
    "therefore , it is very crucial to use proper bin width .",
    "however , as will be shown below , the dependency on the bin width can be reduced by incorporating additional techniques like principal component or independent component analysis .",
    "for multivariate data analysis , suitable representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data into a lower dimensional parametric space .",
    "well known linear transformation methods are principal component analysis ( pca ) , factor analysis , and projection pursuit . independent component analysis ( ica ) is relatively a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non - gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent , or as independent as possible .",
    "such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications , including feature extraction and signal separation @xcite",
    ". basically , two random variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 are said to be independent if information on the value of @xmath78 does not give any information on the value of @xmath79 , and vice versa .",
    "mathematically , if @xmath78 and @xmath79 are said to be independent if and only if the joint probability distribution function ( pdf ) is factorizable so that p(y_1,y_2)=p_1(y_1)p_2(y_2 ) .",
    "this definition extends naturally for any number of @xmath80 random variables , in which case the joint pdf must be a product of @xmath80 terms .",
    "therefore , given any two functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the independent random variables should have the property e[f_1(y_1)f_2(y_2)]=e[f_(y_1)]e[f_2(y_2 ) ] , where @xmath83 stands for an average .",
    "a weaker form of independence is uncorrelatedness .",
    "two random variables are said to be uncorrelated if their covariance is zero : e[y_1y_2]=e[y_1]e[y_2 ] . thus ,",
    "if the variables are independent , they are also unclorrelated . on the otherhand , uncorrelatedness does not imply independence for non - gaussian random variables .",
    "there are many ica techniques that lead to independent estimation of the parameters in the feature space .",
    "common to all ica analysis is the pca transformation which is generally used as a first step to achieve uncorrelatedness .",
    "however , in the present application , we will show that by choosing the proper input parameter space , it is possible to achive independence only through a pca transformation although the input variables are known to be non - gaussian .",
    "the principal component analysis does a simple co - ordinate transformation to principal axes such that the variances of the new co - ordinates are equal to the eigen values of the covariance matrix , which is generated out of a large sample space @xcite .",
    "we consider only the its layers and a single track is chracterized by a @xmath84-dimensional hit vector @xmath85 whose average @xmath86 and covariance @xmath87 are h_i=_n=1^n ( h_i)_n , a_ij= _",
    "n=1^n [ ( h_i)_n - h_i][(h_j)_n - h_j ] , where @xmath88 is the number of hit vectors of the @xmath89 dimensional sample space .",
    "consider the following linear transformation : x_j=_i=1^m _ ijh_i it can be proved @xcite that the variances of @xmath90 are the eigenvalues @xmath91 of the dispersion matrix @xmath92 , when @xmath93 represents the eigenvectors of @xmath94 .",
    "hence , var(x_j)=e^2 = e(_j^2)=_j , where @xmath83 stands for average over @xmath88 and @xmath95 is given by _",
    "ij(h_i - h_i ) .",
    "therefore , the pca is tuned with a training data set in order to calculate the average and the dispersion matrices @xmath96 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the experiment records a set of @xmath60 pair from each layer when a charged particle enters the its detector .",
    "we consider all possible combinations @xmath97 and estimate the generalized distance : _ j=_i=1^m _",
    "ij(c_i - h_i ) , .",
    "d= _ j=1^m _",
    "it is now required that for a track candidate , @xmath98 is less than some maximum value @xmath99 .    in the following ,",
    "we carry out the pca test with different training set . as in figure 1 , we generate @xmath13 charged pions at different @xmath0 . first , we consider a hit vector in @xmath60 space for which @xmath100 as a good its track has @xmath6 pairs of @xmath58 coordiantes .",
    "figure 3 shows the plot of efficiency of accepting good tracks after a pca cut as a function of @xmath0 . as in figure 1 , here the efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of track candidates for which @xmath101 to the total number of good tracks @xmath88 .",
    "the pca is tuned with training data set generated at different @xmath0 .",
    "the symbols in figure 3 show the pca efficiency when the training set is chosen at different @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the pca is tuned with the training data set at @xmath102 gev , all track candidates above @xmath103 gev pass the pca test ( see the filled circle ) . however ,",
    "if the pca is tuned with a training set at higher momentum , say @xmath104 gev ( see open traingles ) , then most of the low @xmath0 tracks , do not pass the pca test .",
    "this is an interesting property which can be utilised to reduce the tracks of low @xmath0 momentum by appropriate choice of the training data set .",
    "we ahve also carried out similar exercise by considering a hit vector in @xmath105 co - ordinates .",
    "figure 4 shows the corresponding plot as that of figure 3 .",
    "however , with the choice of the cartesian co - ordinates , pca does not have any discriminating power .",
    "this aspect can be understood if we examine the number of independent variables which can be obtained through a pca transformation .",
    "figure 5 shows the plot of number of independent variables ( out of @xmath106 , we consider only those variable whose values are significant and are above a given threshold ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "notice that as @xmath0 increases , the number of independent variables reduces to two which is a characteristic of all straight trajectories which can be described by only two independent variables .",
    "such behaviour we do not find , if the input variables are chosen from the cartesian space . therefore , pca transformation in @xmath60 space is nearly equivalent to an ica transformation and can be used as a high pass filter for high @xmath0 tracks .",
    "in the follwoing , we consider the road finder with the combined action of pca and @xmath36 minimization .",
    "the steps are as follows : ( a ) first , we consider all the reconstructed points in the @xmath55 layer . starting with a given @xmath58",
    ", we pick up all the points in the remaining @xmath107 layers within a search window of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "( b ) second , we consider all the combinatorics and accept those which qualify a pca test with @xmath108 .",
    "the pca parameters are tuned with a training set generated at @xmath109 gev . at @xmath110 gev for training so that low @xmath0 tracks below @xmath111 gev can be rejected . ]",
    "( c ) next , we extract the best radius parameter ( @xmath65 ) through a minimum @xmath36 curvature fitting . therefore , at this stage , only one combination is retained for which the @xmath36 is minimum .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 ( in gev ) is extracted through the relation @xmath112 where @xmath53 . as in figure 2",
    ", figures @xmath113 now show the contributions of true and false estimates at different track densities both with ( steps @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) and without pca cut ( steps @xmath114 and @xmath116 ) . with inclusion of pca ,",
    "the true estimates become independent of bin widths as can be seen prominently in figure 8 where the track density is very high .",
    "this is an attractive feature as we need not optimize too much on the bin width as long as it is close too @xmath72 radian or higher .",
    "although , slight higher in bin width increases the number of combinatorics , it still safer to allow little larger width so that we do not loose too much low @xmath0 tracks .",
    "another important aspect of the inclusion of pca test is that the false @xmath0 estimation below @xmath1 gev reduces drastically . in short , with a pca cut ( @xmath108 ) and a bin width of @xmath39 radian , it is possible to extract most of the high @xmath0 tracks above @xmath1 gev with good efficiency .",
    "in the following , we carry out more realistic analysis using hijing event generator .",
    "figure 9 shows the @xmath0 distribution of a single hijing event for @xmath70 over full azimuth with jet options .",
    "these @xmath0 distribution corresponds to the simulated @xmath0 of the rec - points found only at the @xmath55 layer . for the present purpose",
    ", we may consider it as a respresentation of the track density distribution inside the its .",
    "figure 10 shows the @xmath0 distribution which is obtained after the hlt cut as discussed before with a bin width of @xmath72 radian and @xmath117 .",
    "note that in figure 10 , we have only ploted those tracks having a @xmath75 gev obtained using the hlt algorithm as discussed before .",
    "these tracks are mostly due to the jet events .    .",
    "in this report , it is shown that the innner tracking system ( its ) of alice detector can be used for triggering high @xmath0 particles as stand - alone device .",
    "the seed for the trigger road can be selected some where from the middle layer in order to have minimum dispersion both in @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions .",
    "it is found that most of the background low @xmath0 tracks can be rejected by confining the search window to a narrow bin width of @xmath118 radian . in order to estimate the transverse momentum , it is required to consider all the combinatorics inside a given search window which may go up when the track multiplicity is high .",
    "however , it is shown that the number many false combinatorics can be reduced to an acceptable levels through a pca test followed by a least square minimization . using hijing event generator ,",
    "it is shown here that the its can be used to trigger charged particles for @xmath0 above @xmath1 gev or more . the proposed hlt algorithm with its",
    "can be used to trigger high @xmath0 jet particles with good efficiency .",
    "the alice detector consists of a central detector system , covering mid - rapidity @xmath119 over the full azimuth , and several forward systems .",
    "the central system includes , from the interaction vertex to the outside , six layers of high resolution silicon detectors ( inner tracking system - its ) , a time projection chamber ( tpc)-the main tracking device of the experiment , a transition radiation detector for electron identification ( trd ) , and a particle identification array ( time of flight - tof ) .",
    "the central system which is installed inside a large soleniodal magnet with field of @xmath120 also includes an ring imaging cherenkov detector ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 azimuthal coverage ) for the identification of high momentum particle ( high momentum particle identification detector hmpid ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 azimuthal coverage ) consisting of arrays of high density crystals ( photon spectrometer - phos ) .",
    "the large rapidity systems include a muon spectrometer ( @xmath125 ) , a photon counting detector ( photon multiplicity detector - pmd , on the opposite side ) , an ensemble of multiplicity detectors ( fmd ) in the forward rapidity region ( up to @xmath126 ) .",
    "a system of scintillators and quartz counters ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) will provide fast trigger signals , and two sets of neutron and hadron calorimeter , located at @xmath129 and about @xmath130 away from the interaction vertex , will measure the impact parameter ( zero degree calorimeter - zdc ) .",
    "an absorber positioned very close to the vertex shields the muon spectrometer .",
    "the muon spectrometer consists of a dipole magnet , five tracking stations , an iron wall ( muon filter ) to absorb remaining hadrons , and two trigger stations behind the muon filter .",
