    "when non - central collision occurs in heavy ion collision ( hic ) experiment , it is expected that strong electric ( @xmath0 ) and magnetic fields ( @xmath1 ) are generated  @xcite .",
    "such fields would induce the electromagnetic and axial current , and these currents contain information on the properties of the medium , which is quark - gluon plasma at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest components of these currents are , ohmic current and the current generated by the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite , which are linear in terms of the electric / magnetic field , and local .",
    "the effect of these currents has been broadly discussed theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . however ,",
    "when the electromagnetic field becomes strong enough , it is likely that higher order components of the current in terms of the field  @xcite are not negligible compared with the linear component .",

    "nevertheless , the nonlocal and the higher order components of the current have not well investigated systematically .",
    "for this reason , it is an interesting task to analyze what kind of current exists , and which component becomes dominant in hic , in which the inhomogeneous and strong electromagnetic field is expected to be generated , in a systematic way .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the linear and mainly quadratic components of the current in terms of the external electromagnetic field in the quark - gluon plasma , systematically with hic in mind .",
    "there are two reasons why we focus on the quadratic component and do not consider other components that are higher order than the quadratic one : one is that , as we will see later , the quadratic component is the most sensitive term to the chemical potential @xmath3 when @xmath4 is not so large , which is realized in hic .",
    "the other is that , as will be seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : kb ] , the components that is higher than quadratic one , e.g. , cubic or quartic , do not appear if we truncate a systematic expansion , which is called gradient expansion , at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "we work in the following two regimes : one is that the inhomogeneity of the electromagnetic field is so small that the collision effect can not be neglected , which is treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : collision ] . in this case , the current is local , so we can list all the possible form of the current , some of which are found to be forbidden by discussing the charge conjugation and the parity property .",

    ", we calculate the quadratic current explicitly with the vlasov equation .",
    "we also systematically calculate the current by applying the gradient expansion to the kadanoff - baym equation . as a result",
    ", we show that the quadratic current at the nlo in the gradient expansion agrees with the one calculated with the vlasov equation , while it has been known that the calculation at the leading order ( lo ) reproduces  @xcite the result of the hard thermal / dense loop ( htl / hdl ) approximation  @xcite , and the linear current at the nlo is equal to the cme current  @xcite .",
    "we also show that at the nlo order , the currents that are higher than quadratic current do not appear .",
    "we demonstrate that the quadratic current can have the same order of magnitude as that of cme current , by using a possible field configuration realized in hic in sec .",

    "we note that , in general , the inhomogeneities in space and time are independent quantities , so their orders of magnitude can be different . in this paper , we assume that they have the same order of magnitude , for simplicity .",

    "some properties of the currents above can be determined by looking at how these quantities transform under the discrete transformations , which is summarized in table  [ tab : cpt ] .",
    "since the p property of the current operator is different from those of @xmath1 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , these components can not exist and only @xmath14 remain as long as @xmath5 , which violates the p symmetry , is zero .",
    "also , the c property of the remaining terms is the same as that of the current operator , so these terms can exist in @xmath15 case , in which the c symmetry is not broken .",
    "this property implies that , in @xmath16 case , which is realized in hic , these terms approximately do not depend on @xmath3 .",

    "the results in this paper suggest that the quadratic current is the most sensitive term to @xmath3 , so it could be useful to analyze the experimental effect of this current in hic , in order to measure indirectly @xmath3 realized in hic .",
    "especially , the low - energy scan done in relativistic heavy ion collider can be relevant since @xmath3 is expected to be relatively large .",
    "also , the results suggest that , when the configuration of the electromagnetic field satisfies @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we can neglect the currents that are higher order than the quadratic one .    in this work , we computed the current around the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "however , in hic , the system expands , so taking into account this effect is one way to proceed the analysis further .",

    "( [ eq : boltzmann - result-1st ] ) and ( [ eq : boltzmann - result-2nd-1st ] ) , are expected to appear .",
    "also , the flow vector appears as a vector quantity with which we can construct the current , so we expect that there appears more terms  @xcite in the current than those in our paper .    another way of improving the analysis in this paper is , to calculate the next - to - next - to - leading order terms with the kadanoff - baym equation .",
    "in such analysis , we expect that the gradient expansion is more difficult to apply , and the htl resummation  @xcite becomes necessary due to the following reason : as was discussed before , the dominant contribution to the current at the nlo comes from the region @xmath114 .",
    "by contrast , in the next - to - next - to - leading order calculation , we expect that integral like @xmath162^{-1}$ ] appears instead of @xmath113^{-1}$ ] , and this integral contains infrared singularity . after removing the singularity with the htl resummation , which generates the infrared cutoff that is of order debye mass",
    ", the dominant contribution comes from the region @xmath163 . in this case",
    ", the assumption @xmath67 , which justifies the gradient expansion , is replaced with @xmath164 , so the gradient expansion is more difficult to apply .",
    "finally , we remark that the calculation of the quadratic current in this paper is also relevant to analysis of photon splitting process  @xcite induced by finite density , since the quadratic current contains the information of the three - point function of the photon  @xcite .",
    "we leave the investigation of the photon splitting process in future work  @xcite .",

    "<S> we perform the first systematic study of the nonlinear electromagnetic currents induced by external electromagnetic field in quark - gluon plasma , both in the two cases that the inhomogeneity of electromagnetic field is small ( large ) so that the collision effect is important ( negligible ) . in the former case , we list and classify possible components of the currents in a systematic way , and make an order estimate of each component by using the boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation . in the latter case , we explicitly calculate the quadratic current by using the vlasov equation , and find that the current generated by the chiral magnetic effect and the quadratic current can have the same order of magnitude by using the kadanoff - baym equation . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate this property by using a possible configuration of electromagnetic field realized in heavy ion collision . </S>"
