    "neutron captures are the main way for the building up of the nuclei heavier than iron . according to the seminal work by burbidge et al .",
    "( 1957 ) , in order to reconstruct the galactic evolutionary history of heavy elements one has to consider two major mechanisms of neutron addition : the @xmath2-process ( slow neutron - captures ) and the @xmath4-process ( rapid neutron - captures ) . for the @xmath2-process",
    ", the abundance distribution in the solar system was early recognized to derive from a non unique site .",
    "indeed , the phenomenological approach of @xmath2-process studies , or _",
    "classical _ analysis , was shown to require three components to account for the abundances of all @xmath2-nuclei from fe to bi : the _ weak _ , the _",
    "main _ , and the _ strong _ component ( seeger , fowler , & clayton  1965 ; clayton & rassbach  1967 ; kppeler et al .  1982 ; kppeler , beer , & wisshak  1989 ) .",
    "the weak component , responsible for the @xmath2-process nuclides up to @xmath5 90 , was ascribed to neutron captures occurring in advanced evolutionary phases of massive stars , through the activation of the @xmath6ne(@xmath7,n)@xmath8 mg reaction ( lamb et al .",
    "1977 ; prantzos et al .",
    "1990 ; raiteri et al .  1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the main component , feeding the heavier @xmath2-process nuclides up to @xmath9 208 , is known to originate in agb stars of galactic disk metallicity during recurrent thermal pulses , hereafter tp .",
    "many theoretical and observational works ( see busso , gallino , & wasserburg  1999 for a review ) converge on the idea that low - mass stars ( hereafter lms , @xmath10 @xmath11 4 @xmath12 ) play the dominant role in @xmath2-processing , and that neutrons are released in radiative conditions in the interpulse phase via the @xmath13c(@xmath7,n)@xmath14o reaction ( straniero et al .",
    "a tiny @xmath13c _ pocket _ is thought to develop in the top layers of the he- and c - rich zone ( called he intershell ) as a consequence of the penetration of a small amount of protons from the envelope , to burn locally and to produce neutrons before the development of the next tp . during advanced tps a second small neutron burst",
    "is released by the marginal activation of the @xmath6ne(@xmath7,n)@xmath8 mg reaction . finally , the strong component was advanced on theoretical grounds by the classical analysis of the @xmath2-process ( clayton & rassbach 1967 ) , in order to reproduce more than 50% of @xmath3pb , the most abundant pb isotope in the solar system , although the astrophysical site for this process remained unknown .    in this work we study the galactic enrichment of pb in the light of agb nucleosynthesis results presented by straniero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gallino et al .",
    "one of the main goals of these works was the development of a new set of model calculations for agb stars with different masses and metallicities , to provide stronger evolutionary supports to nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "the results demonstrated in detail the dependence of the @xmath2-process yields on stellar metallicity , and introduced the idea that a separate astrophysical site for the strong component might be unnecessary ( gallino et al .",
    "1998 ) , because a large production of @xmath3pb derives from agb stars of low metallicity .",
    "this expectation must however be substantiated with a detailed model for the galactic enrichment , to verify whether the production of pb isotopes is really adequate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   2 we discuss the sensitivity of pb production ( in particular @xmath3pb ) to metallicity and to different assumptions on the @xmath13c pocket in low - mass agb stars .",
    "we also analyze the role of intermediate - mass agb stars in the pb production at different metallicities . in ",
    "3 we present spectroscopic estimates by synthetic spectra of the pb abundance on a limited sample of field metal - poor stars using the pb line at 3683.48     and outline the difficulties and the aims of such an analysis . in ",
    "4 we briefly introduce the galactic chemical evolution ( hereafter gce ) model adopted , present our predictions for the @xmath2-components of the pb isotopes in the solar system , and compute the [ pb / fe ] = log ( pb / fe ) @xmath1 log ( pb / fe)@xmath15 trend vs. metallicity in the three galactic zones in which the gce model is organized ( halo , thick disk and thin disk ) .",
    "then we compare our model predictions with the above new spectroscopic determinations and with a few other published data , outlining the need of a dedicate observational effort .",
    "finally , in   5 we summarize the main conclusions and point out a few aspects deserving further analysis .",
    "we compute stellar yields for @xmath2-processing of pb in agb stars as a result of post - process calculations on the basis of stellar evolutionary models obtained with franec ( frascati raphson - newton evolutionary code ; see chieffi & straniero  1989 ) and presented in straniero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gallino et al .",
    "additional models have been discussed by vaglio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and straniero et al .",
    "the detailed evolutionary computations were performed at [ fe / h ] = 0.0 , @xmath10.3 and @xmath11.3 for the agb stars of mass 1.5 and 3 @xmath12 .",
    "for the 5 @xmath12  case the metallicities were [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and @xmath11.3 , while for the 7 @xmath12  star only models of solar metallicity were calculated .",
    "the @xmath2-process results has then been obtained with post - process runs span over the metallicity interval from @xmath16 down to @xmath17/4000 for 1.5 , 3 , 5 and 7 @xmath12 .",
    "the results of the franec stellar structures are extrapolated to the whole metallicity range adopted for the @xmath2-process calculations ( more details are available in straniero et al .",
    "1997 ,  2000 , and gallino et al .",
    "mass loss was taken into account by adopting the parameterization of reimers  ( 1975 ) .",
    "the values adopted for this work are @xmath18 0.3 for 1.5 @xmath12  , and @xmath18 1.5 for 3 @xmath12  ( straniero et al .",
    "calculations for 5 @xmath12  and 7 @xmath12   are instead performed with @xmath18 10 and @xmath18 3 , respectively ( straniero et al .",
    "the models self - consistently reproduce the so - called _ third dredge up _ episode ( tdu ) , defined as the penetration of the convective envelope below the h - he discontinuity .",
    "tdu was found to occur after a limited number of tps and to cease when the envelope mass decreases by mass loss below a limiting mass of @xmath0 0.5 @xmath12 .",
    "the cumulative mass for the he intershell dredged up into the envelope of agb models of 1.5 , 3 , 5 , and 7 @xmath12  according to franec models and eventually ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds is reported in table  1 .",
    "different treatments for convection with respect to the one adopted in franec , where the convective / radiative borders are followed according to the schwarzschild criterion , may provide larger tdu efficiencies , as e.g. discussed by frost & lattanzio ( 1996 ) , herwig et al .",
    "1997 ; langer et al .  1999 ;",
    "herwig  2000 ) .",
    "moreover , the criterion adopted for the mass loss during the agb phase introduces a second major source of uncertainty , and at the present moment only the comparison with observations is expected to provide constraints on these points .",

    "( 1999 ) with the outcome of our gce , one can notice that there is a good agreement for all pb isotopes , with the exception of @xmath3pb .",
    "in fact arlandini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained an @xmath2-process contribution of 10% to @xmath3pb ( 19% to elemental pb ) .",
    "they instead estimated a higher 34% of the @xmath2-process contribution to @xmath3pb ( and 46% to elemental pb ) from their single agb model ( `` stellar model '' ) with the st choice and [ fe / h]= @xmath10.3 ( actually a mean of 1.5 and 3 @xmath12  agb models ) , which also reproduces the main component . the discrepancy of the two above predictions on @xmath3pb by the classical analysis and by the `` stellar model '' was already a clear indication that not a unique agb stellar model , nor the classical analysis , were able to explain the main component in the solar system , which must be considered as the outcome of different generations of agb stars prior of the solar system formation .",
    "as a matter of fact , our gce calculations provide 89% of @xmath3pb abundance , thanks to the contribution of different generations of agb stars and in particular to those at low metallicities , which are the main contributors to @xmath3pb .",
    "the proper account of gce confirms in a quantitative way what was anticipated by gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , i.e. that the role previously attributed to the strong component is actually played by agb stars of low metallicity .    a remarkable result of introducing the agb yields at different metallicities ( as shown in fig .",
    "1 for @xmath3pb ) as input data of gce computations is that the predicted chemical compositions in the interstellar medium at any epoch are grossly independent of the particular @xmath13c _ profile _ adopted inside the @xmath13c pocket .",
    "for example , the results presented in the last column of table  3 remain essentially the same even assuming a constant @xmath13c mass fraction in the pocket .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere , including the gce trends of all pb isotopes .",
    "the @xmath2-process yields discussed in   2 and shown in fig .  1 allow us to estimate the chemical enrichment of pb in the galaxy at different epochs .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the resulting @xmath2-fraction of lead in the thick and in the thin disk .",
    "this has been obtained by considering agb stars in the mass range 2 @xmath1 8 @xmath12 , but the dominant production of pb comes in the mass range 2 @xmath1 4 @xmath12  ( see discussion in   2 ) .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath2-process contribution dominates the gce of pb , starting from [ fe / h ] @xmath241.5 , both in the thick and thin disk .",
    "this is mostly due to the coincidence between the peak of pb production in lms ( in the range @xmath25 [ fe / h ] @xmath261 ) with the peak of the star formation rate in the thick and thin disk . at lower values of [ fe / h ] , independently of the characteristics of the gce model , the contribution of @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis rapidly decreases as a result of the long lifetimes of agb stars .",
    "this confirms previous results of the gce evolution of elements from ba to eu ( travaglio et al .",
    "at very low metallicities , as suggested by spectroscopic observations ( in particular of ba and eu ) and pointed out by travaglio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the @xmath2-contribution by agb stars is by far too small .",
    "instead , as anticipated by spite & spite  ( 1978 ) on observational grounds and by truran  ( 1981 ) on theoretical grounds , the heavy element abundance pattern in very metal - poor stars is compatible with an @xmath4-process origin .",
    "this point was recently sustained by observations of low metallicity halo stars ( sneden et al .",
    "1998 ; mcwilliam  1998 ; sneden et al .  2000",
    "; westin et al .",
    "2000 ; ryan et al .  2000b , and references therein ) .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , despite a large number of recent works , the astrophysical site of the @xmath4-process is still a debated problem ( e.g. , wheeler , cowan , & hillebrandt  1998 ; freiburghaus et al .",
    "1999 ) . in order to quantify the @xmath4-contribution , as described in more detail by travaglio et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we treat the @xmath4-process as a typical primary mechanism occurring in a subset of type ii sne ( those in the mass range 8 @xmath1 10 @xmath12 ) .",
    "recent theoretical simulations by wheeler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) support this choice . our estimate of @xmath4-process abundances at @xmath27 was simply derived by subtracting from the solar abundances the @xmath2-fractions .    in fig .",
    "4 the predicted galactic evolutionary trend for the @xmath28 contribution to pb is shown . in the figure",
    "we also compare our model to recent spectroscopic data for halo and disk field stars at different metallicities , discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is clear that a larger set of observations is desirable , and we underline that these are the first available observational data of pb .",
    "the star with [ fe / h ] = @xmath13.1 and [ pb / fe ] = + 1.3 is the very peculiar cs  22893 - 052 ( recent observations of pb in this star has been presented by sneden et al .",
    "this star shows exceptionally high abundances of all heavy elements , with @xmath4-process / fe enrichment of @xmath040 times the solar ratios .",
    "therefore it was probably born in an environment strongly polluted by sn debris with respect to the average interstellar gas in the halo .",
    "this supports the current idea of an incomplete mixing of the gas in the galactic halo at early epochs , which would allow the formation of stars both very deprived , or very enriched , in @xmath4-process elements ( for recent studies of this problem see e.g. tsujimoto , shigeyama , & yoshii  1999 ; raiteri et al .",
    "1999 ; argast et al .",
    "2000 ; travaglio , galli , & burkert  2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied the evolution of pb in the interstellar gas of the galaxy , adopting a new set of models for @xmath2-processing in agb stars of different metallicities , and new observational constraints of unevolved field stars for pb abundances .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath2-process yields with post - process calculations based on agb models and applied these yields in the framework of a galactic model that follows the gce of the halo , thick and thin disk . taking into account the important role played by different generations of low - metallicity agb stars for the production of pb in the galaxy , we obtain at @xmath27 a pb @xmath2-fraction of 91% , together with a sharp increase at [ fe / h ] @xmath241.5 .",
    "confirming the prediction by gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we also found that the production of the most abundant pb isotope , @xmath3pb , is matched when the @xmath2-process occurring in low - metallicity agb stars is properly considered in the context of the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "only a small portion of @xmath3pb can be attributed to the @xmath4-process , even accounting for decays of transuranic isotopes .",
