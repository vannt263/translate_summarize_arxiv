    "thirtyfive years have passed since brent tully and rick fisher advocated the use of the relation between optical luminosity @xmath0 and 21 cm hi linewidth @xmath1 , previously discovered by mort roberts , as a tool to obtain redshift - independent distances of spiral galaxies ( roberts 1969 ; tully & fisher 1977 ) . since then",
    ", the tully - fisher relation ( hereafter tfr ) has been used extensively in the measurement of @xmath2and that of deviations from smooth hubble flow , to distances approaching @xmath3 . over the range of linewidths @xmath4 km  s@xmath5 , typically used in those applications ,",
    "the tfr exhibits a tight power - law behavior , where the linewidth is to first order equal to twice the maximum rotational velocity of the disk within galactocentric radii populated with detectable hi , and @xmath0 a proxy for total mass within that radius .",
    "a tfr template will have a slope of between 3 and 4 in @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 and a scatter between 0.14 and 0.18 dex in @xmath6 ( 0.35 to 0.45 mag ) , which translates to a distance uncertainty for a single galaxy between 15% and 20% . these values vary somewhat depending mostly on the adopted optical band .",
    "the quality of a tfr template , i.e. the accuracy with which it can accurately provide a distance prediction , depends on a variety of parameters , including primarily those pertaining to the selection criteria for membership in the sample used to define that template and the reliability of the corrections applied to the observed quantities . improvements to that quality should result from a clear understanding of the sources of scatter and of the physical basis of the tfr .",

    "the luminosity is then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the central disk surface brightness .",

    "the shape of the rotation curve , its maximum value and its value at the virial radius ( indicated by the short , thick line at the left of each box ) , vary widely from each other , illustrating the uncertainty that can be associated with the determination of the tfr linewidth parameter .",
    "because now @xmath30 is not constant , it matters at which radius @xmath31 it is measured .",
    "it is sensible to measure it at a radius near which the gradient of @xmath32 is small , e.g. the radius within which 80% of the light is produced , or a few disk scale lengths @xmath33 out ( a value of @xmath34 is often used , and @xmath35 is near @xmath36 ) .",

    "finally , to convert the disk mass relation into a tfr look - alike , @xmath37 is divided by a stellar mass  to  luminosity ratio ; a star formation efficiency factor @xmath41 is also introduced , which accounts for the fraction of the disk baryon mass which has been converted to stars . thus : l_d = 1.710 ^ 11h^-1 m _   _ sf   ( m_d0.05 )  ( ml)^-1 _ *   ^3 ^-1f_v [ eq : tfr ] accurately modeling @xmath42 is difficult , and so is measuring @xmath43 .",

    "the signature of weak lensing was identified in the stacked images , thus yielding averaged halo masses out to @xmath21 .",

    "interestingly , the corresponding stellar masses , as fractions of the total baryon mass @xmath51 , computed assuming baryons are present with the cosmic abundance within the halo , are 0.15 , 0.26 and 0.23 for the three stellar mass bins , where @xmath52 is the cosmic baryon mass fraction .",
    "disk galaxies in the three stellar mass bins fall short of converting their baryons into stars by factors of between 4 and 5 .",

    "the mismatch between the observed baryon mass in disks and that which would be expected if the baryons were present within the halo in the fraction @xmath53 is thought to be mainly due : ( a ) for low halo masses : to the inability of the halos to hold on to their baryons , which increases with decreasing halo mass ; ( b ) for galaxies near the peak of the curve : likely to the fact that in those systems most baryons are in hot galactic coronae , rather than in disks . the reyes ( 2012 ) data are identified by the three circles near the top of the curve in the left panel .",

    ", it is not possible to derive the intrinsic @xmath65 scatter .",
    "however , as huang  point out , it is apparent in figure 3 that the mean value of @xmath56 remains nearly constant along lines of constant @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the typical tfr target galaxies are extracted from a sample with much tighter variance than the hi - selected lot shown in the figure .",
    "it appears safe to assume that the scatter in @xmath65 in galaxies of a tfr sample is smaller by at least a factor of 2 than that in any sample representative of the global halo mass function resulting from numerical simulations , estimated to be about 0.22 dex .",
    "the less than initially feared impact of @xmath56-scatter on the rv law makes the latter a desirable complement to tfr .",
    "* saintonge & spekkens ( 2011 ) ) find that the scatter of the i  band rv relation can be reduced to @xmath71 dex on the linear size parameter , if @xmath8 is replaced with an isophotal radius measured at a large enough galactocentric distance so that the disk is transparent and the isophotal radius requires no correction for opacity .",
    "such an rv relation is comparable in predictive quality with the tfr .",

    "* giovanelli  1998 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dale & giovanelli 2000 ) ) . combined with their clustering properties , an uneven distribution of galaxies in the template sample can produce tfr template relations with an incorrect zero - point , simulating inflating or deflating , local group - centered hubble bubbles . * * sample selection : basket of clusters . *",
    "photometric parameters of galaxies , such as inclinations to the line of sight and disk scale lengths , are best measured for relatively nearby objects .",
    "peculiar velocities of galaxies can contribute a measurable fraction of tfr scatter at distances up to @xmath74 mpc . in the case of a cluster with n measured members ,",
    "the offset from a template due to the cluster motion can be gauged with an accuracy about @xmath75 times better than for a single galaxy .",
    "thus , if the tfr template sample consists of galaxies in clusters , the component of the scatter introduced by each cluster s peculiar velocity is removable .",
    "this can be achieved by adding cluster galaxies to the template after their offset from the mean tfr , due to the peculiar velocity of their parent cluster , has been removed .",
    "a template relation built from galaxies in a basket of clusters will thus have smaller scatter than one obtained for a field galaxy sample . *",
    "* photometric band .",
    "* because a good estimate of the kinematical parameter in the tfr requires that galaxies be sufficiently inclined to the line of sight , corrections to the optical flux for internal extinction are an important source of tfr scatter .",
    "this advises for selecting a photometric band within which internal extinction corrections are small , a concern that needs to be weighed against the requirement that the photometry be as representative as possible of the stellar population .",
    "major tfr surveys of the last two decades chose either r or i optical bands as a compromise between the two requirements . more recently , the wide field coverage of the _ spitzer space telescope _ archival data in the 3.8 @xmath76 m band has offered the opportunity to build substantial tfr samples for which extinction corrections  very small  and homogeneity of the photometric source offer the possibility of reduced scatter .",
    "the recent work of sorce  ( 2012 ) indicates that , while the reliance in a consistent photometric scale over the whole sky is a definite plus , improvements in tfr scatter by going to the mid  ir are not yet substantial : the scatter of a preliminary 3.8 @xmath76 m template is 0.49 mag , which can be reduced to 0.42 mag after introducing a color correction .",
    "contamination by emission from hot dust and pahs may play a role in the relatively high scatter of this relation .",
    "+ as just indicated , a color correction can have an important impact in reducing the tfr scatter . until recently ,",
    "large tfr samples were monochromatic .",
    "a dependence of the tfr template attributed to morphological type has often been found in monochromatic tfr templates ( e.g. figures 3 and 4 of giovanelli  1997 ) : that is in fact a color dependence .",
    "availability of multicolor photometry can thus be a good asset towards building a good scaling relation template . * * stellar vs. baryonic .",
    "* in the tfr , disk luminosity is considered a proxy for stellar mass , and the relation becomes significantly noisier for disks with rotational velocities smaller than 50 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "however , the power law character of the tfr is preserved through slower rotators if disk luminosity is replaced with the baryon mass , defined as the sum of the ism mass , as obtained via the 21 cm hi line , and the stellar mass as inferred from the disk luminosity and color .",
    "figure 4 ( after mcgaugh 2012 ) shows the baryonic tfr behavior as a single power law to rotational velocities as low as 20 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the usefulness of this relation can apply to the determination of distances to nearby dwarf systems , as an economical substitute for techniques such as the measurement of the trgb .",
    "* * line widths vs. resolved rotation curves . *",
    "the two panels of figure 4 differ in the adoption of the kinematic parameter : the scatter in the baryonic tfr is significantly reduced if the rotational velocity is inferred from a resolved rotation curve ( the label @xmath77 indicates that the velocity was measured at a radius at which the rotation curve becomes `` flat '' ) . a template that uses single - dish hi",
    "line widths is economical , but it can be improved if replaced with h@xmath78 rotation curves and , even more so , if hi synthesis maps are available , for the hi can be typically detected to larger galactocentric radii than h@xmath78 and therefore provide a better sampling of the large - scale dynamics of the galaxy . *",
    "* the cost of reduced scatter . * several of the recommendations in this section require more data than does the  basic `` tfr .",
    "for the added value , there is a cost penalty .",
    "since we live in times of fiscal austerity , it can be useful to quantify the cost of reduced scatter .",
    "the more ' ' expensive \" observational parameter is the kinematical one .",
    "consider three versions of the latter , more often used , and the operating costs of telescopes needed to obtain them .",
    ", and see how they would impact a tfr project budget : * * single dish hi line widths ; cost : @xmath79 gal@xmath5 ; feasible sample size : @xmath80 * * h@xmath78 rotation curve ; cost : @xmath81k gal@xmath5 ; feasible sample size : @xmath82 * * hi synthesis map ; cost : @xmath83k gal@xmath5 ; feasible sample size : @xmath84 + these are very rough numbers . perhaps better deals can be had after careful shopping . * * invitation to harvest .",
    "* by the way , the alfalfa hi survey is now complete and nearly half of the extragalactic hi sources are in the public domain .",
    "the final catalog will contain more than 30,000 sources , including optical identifications , hi masses and line widths .",
