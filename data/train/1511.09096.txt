    "in the many processes considered in biological , engineering or physical sciences normal diffusion or subdiffusion occurs in a system composed of two media , separated by a partially permeable thin membrane ; in each part of the system different parameters characterizing diffusion may occur . as an example , we mention the transport of various substances ( glucose , pyruvate , lactate , alanine ) between blood and a cell @xcite , diffusion of various substances ( medications , cosmetics ) through the skin @xcite , diffusion of various substances in the brain @xcite , diffusion between extracellular brain space and cells @xcite , diffusion of large molecular drugs into the brain @xcite , nisin diffusion into agarose gel @xcite . a list of similar examples can be significantly expanded , see also the problems discussed in @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion is usually defined as a random walk process in which @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean square displacement of a random walker , @xmath5 is a subdiffusion parameter ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is a subdiffusion coefficient , measured in units @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes the gamma function",
    ". the process of subdiffusion can occur in media in which particles movement is greatly hindered due to the internal structure of a medium such as , for example , in gels @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion is usually described by the following subdiffusion equation with the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional time derivative ( here @xmath6 ) @xcite @xmath10 the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional derivative is defined as being valid for @xmath11 ( here @xmath12 is a natural number which fulfils @xmath13 ) @xmath14 for @xmath15 one obtains a normal diffusion equation .",
    "we consider subdiffusion in a system which consists of two media separated by a thin partially permeable membrane . in each part of the system , bounded by the membrane",
    ", there may be different subdiffusion parameters .",
    "we assume that the system is homogeneous in a plane perpendicular to the @xmath16 axis , thus the system is effectively one  dimensional .",
    "the thin membrane is treated here as a partially permeable wall .",
    "a diffusing particle which tries to pass through the membrane can be stopped by the membrane with some probability or can jump through the membrane to another part of the system .",
    "the membrane is assumed to be so thin that the particle s random walk inside the membrane is not considered . to solve the subdiffusion equation in a membrane system ,",
    "two boundary conditions at the membrane are needed . however , until now , various boundary conditions which are not equivalent to one another have been assumed at the membrane , see for example @xcite .",
    "we present the method of deriving the probability @xmath17 ( the green s function ) of finding a particle at point @xmath16 at time @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the initial position of a particle in the composite system with a thin membrane .",
    "we derive the green s functions using a simple random walk model with both discrete time and spatial variables .",
    "next we move to the continuous variables by means of the procedure presented in this paper . from the green s functions we derive boundary conditions at a thin membrane . in the paper",
    "@xcite the method based on the random walk model on a lattice was used to determine the green s functions for a system with a thin membrane in which the homogeneous medium is divided by a thin membrane into two parts .",
    "however , this method is not applicable to the system in which the subdiffusion parameters are different at each part of the system . in this paper",
    "we present a new method of deriving the green s functions for the composite system with a thin membrane .    a random walk model with a discrete time and space variable appears to be a useful tool in modeling anomalous or normal diffusion @xcite .",
    "this model is particularly conducive in determining the green s function for a system in which the uniformity of a system is disturbed at one point @xcite ; the point represents a membrane which is located perpendicularly to the @xmath16 axis in a one  dimensional system . in order to move from discrete to continuous time in a homogeneous system one assumes that the time which is needed for a particle to take its next step is ruled by the distribution @xmath20 .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated in a system which consists of two parts with different transport properties since the two distributions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which describe the time which a particle needs to take its next step in the regions @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 denotes the position of a membrane ) , respectively , are required . in order to incorporate correctly these distributions into the green s function obtained for a discrete time ,",
    "it is desirable to know how many particle s steps are performed in each region . in this paper we will show the new method of calculating the green s functions for a membrane system , which omits the difficulties described above and is relatively simple to use .",
    "this method is based on the ` mathematical trick ' , which consists of considering the random walk of a particle @xmath26 in a system with two kinds of reactions with static particles @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the first reaction , @xmath29 , can occur with probability @xmath0 in the region @xmath23 , the second reaction , @xmath30 , can occur with probability @xmath1 , in the region @xmath24 . supposing that the particles @xmath27 and @xmath28 are distributed homogeneously in the appropriate parts of the system , the reaction probabilities do not depend on a space variable . solving the difference equations describing the random walk with reactions ( more specifically finding the generating functions for these equations ) and connecting the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 with the reaction probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , we finally obtain the green s functions in which the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are correctly incorporate in the model .",
    "following this , in order to obtain the green s functions for the system without recations , we place @xmath2 . in the last step ,",
    "we move from a discrete to continuous space variable .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "[ seciii ] , we find the green s functions for the following cases .",
    "the first one , when a particle starts its random walk in a ` faster ' medium , the second one in which a particle starts its random walk in a slower medium , and the third one in which both media have the same subdiffusion parameters but different subdiffusion coefficients .",
    "the ` faster ' medium is defined as a medium having a larger parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the properties of the green s functions and boundary conditions at the membrane are also discussed . in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] , we discuss the ` memory effect ' created both by the membrane and by the discontinuity occurring at a point in which media become joined .",

    "we will conclude that the long memory effect caused by the junction of two media with different subdiffusion parameters @xmath5 is stronger than the effect created by a thin membrane .",
    "in this paper we present the new method of deriving the green s function for a system in which two different media are separated by a thin partially permeable membrane . within this method",
    "we first consider a particle s random walk in a system with a discrete time and space variable in which the particle may vanish due to reactions with constant probabilities defined separately for each medium .",
    "the reactions fulfil the supporting role .",
    "since we link the reaction parameters to subdiffusion parameters , the presence of reactions allow us to include the subdiffusion parameters of both media into the green s functions derived from a random walk model .",
    "so , we move from discrete to continuous variables in the obtained formulae and eliminate the reactions .",
    "finally , we obtained the green s functions for the system without reactions .",
    "the functions obtained were used to determine the boundary conditions at the thin membrane .",
    "the results presented in this paper are also valid when normal diffusion occurs in the system .",
    "we obtain the green s functions and boundary conditions for a normal diffusion case by placing @xmath265 and/or @xmath266 into the obtained formulae .",
    "the model based on the random walk model with a discrete time and space variable seems to be oversimplified .",
    "however , it provides somewhat nontrivial results which have a simple physical interpretation .",
    "we add that such models were used to model subdiffusion processes in membrane systems @xcite , as was mentionad earlier in this paper , as well as in the system with reactions @xcite .",
    "the presence of a fractional derivative in the equation describing a certain process testifies that this is a process with a relatively long memory . in this paper",
    "we show that the probability of finding a particle at the membrane surface is dependent on the history of residence of the particle at the opposite membrane surface .",
    "there are two main reasons which create this long memory process .",
    "the first reason is that the media separated by a membrane have a different diffusion character which means here that the media have different subdiffusion parameters @xmath154 .",
    "the second reason is the presence of a thin membrane . when @xmath159 , the memory effect is represented by the second term occuring on the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq75 ] ) , which can be omitted over a long time limit .",
    "thus , the first reason dominates the second in creating a ` long memory effect ' over a long time limit at a plane at which the system is discontinuous .",
    "we note that this ` long memory effect ' can play an important role if we are considering subdiffusion or normal diffusion in the membrane system in which particles can react with static particles located at the membrane surface .",
    "the green s functions differ qualitatively depending on whether a particle starts its subdiffusive random walk from a faster or slower medium , which is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2][fig7 ] .",
    "if the particle starts from a faster medium , then its random walk in this medium is performed just as in the medium with an absorbing membrane , whereas when the particle starts from a slower medium , then its random walk in this medium is similar to subdiffusion occurring in a system with a reflecting membrane over a long time limit . in both cases ,",
    "the probability of finding the particle in the slower medium significantly increases over time .",
    "we have considered the process in which @xmath267 .",
    "the green s functions obtained in this paper can be easily transformed for the case of @xmath268 using the symmetry argument , which , in practice , means that the following conversion is made : @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , and @xmath277 .",
    "if we consider a system with many particles and if the particles move independently of each other , the concentration of particles @xmath278 can be calculated by means of the following formula @xmath279 .",

    "( 78)(90 ) in the above cited paper ) , where subdiffusion in a system in which a thin membrane separates two identical media is taken into account .",
    "the results presented in this paper agree in part with the results obtained in @xcite , in which subdiffusion in a system which consists of two different subdiffusive media are joined at point @xmath25 . however , in these papers , only the green s function for the case of @xmath281 was found .",

    "below , we add the comments concerning the technical aspects of the calculations presented in this paper .",
    "the moving from a discrete to continuous spatial variable is interpreted slightly differently from mathematical or physical points of view .",
    "mathematically , this moving consists of calculating the limit @xmath282 in the green s functions already obtained for a discrete spatial variable .",
    "physically , supposing that @xmath109 is very small but finite , one may expand the green s functions in the series with respect to @xmath109 and then omit the terms of the order equal to or larger than 1 with respect to @xmath109 .",
    "the difference between both approaches is caused by the fact that in the limit @xmath120 , the probability distribution @xmath20 of the waiting time for a particle to take its next step loses its physical interpretation ; this problem is briefly discussed just below eq .",
    "( [ eq34 ] )",
    ". however , these two approaches lead to the same result ; so , in practice , it is possible to use both in order to find the functions for a continuous spatial variable .",
    "one of the criteria that provides the utility of the used approximation is that the green s functions obtained for a membrane system should depend on the parameters of membrane permeability including the case of @xmath283 ( see the discussion presented in @xcite ) .",
    "however , when @xmath154 , several leading terms in the series which approximate the functions ( [ eq38 ] ) and ( [ eq39 ] ) with respect to @xmath111 , are dependent on the ratio @xmath284 alone ; the number of leading terms increases when @xmath285 becomes smaller . when @xmath283 , in order to include the membrane permeability parameters in the approximate green s functions , we have to include a relatively large number of terms , especially when @xmath286 .",
    "this problem does not occur in the system with @xmath159 . in this paper",
    ", we consider the subdiffusion in the composite membrane system for the case of @xmath154 , assuming @xmath173 .",
    "we presume that the last condition is not significantly limiting in our considerations .",
    "although from the mathematical point of view , the cases @xmath283 and @xmath173 should be treated ` equitably ' , from the physical point of view , the case of @xmath173 is preferable .",
    "the case of @xmath283 naturally occurs when a symmetrical thin membrane is located in a homogeneous system in which @xmath159 .",
    "the green s functions for such a system are a special case of the functions obtained in sec . iiic .",
    "for the system in which @xmath154 , the coefficients @xmath287 and @xmath288 , which are given in different physical units , are equal for a very particular combination of parameters which reads @xmath289 .",

    "<S> we consider subdiffusion in a system which consists of two media separated by a thin membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the subdiffusion parameters may be different in each of the medium . using the new method presented in this paper we derive the probabilities ( the green s functions ) describing a particle s random walk in the system . within this method we firstly consider the particle s random walk in a system with both discrete time and space variables in which a particle can vanish due to reactions with constant probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , defined separately for each medium . </S>",
    "<S> then , we move from discrete to continuous variables . </S>",
    "<S> the reactions included in the model play a supporting role . </S>",
    "<S> we link the reaction probabilities with the other subdiffusion parameters which characterize the media by means of the formulae presented in this paper . calculating the generating functions for the difference equations describing the random walk in the composite membrane system with reactions , which depend explicitly on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we are able to correctly incorporate the subdiffusion parameters of both the media into the green s functions . finally , placing @xmath2 into the obtained functions we get the green s functions for the composite membrane system without any reactions . from the obtained green s functions , </S>",
