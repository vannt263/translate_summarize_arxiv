    "entanglement is the quintessence of nonclassicality in composite quantum systems . as a physical resource",
    "it finds many applications especially in quantum information theory , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "entangled states are exactly those states that can not be modelled within the classical paradigm of locality and realism @xcite .",
    "contrary to states of classical composite systems , they allow better knowledge of the system as a whole than of each component of the system  @xcite .",
    "the notion of entanglement is therefore of interest within areas of both application and interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the problem of distinguishing entangled states from nonentangled ( separable ) states is a fundamental issue .",
    "pure separable states of a bipartite system are exactly the pure product states , they are easily recognized by singular value decomposition , also known as schmidt decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the situation is much more complicated for mixed states .",
    "a separable mixed state is a state mixed from pure product states  @xcite .",
    "the separability problem of distinguishing mixed separable states from mixed entangled states has received attention along two lines . on the one hand , operational or computational tests for separability are constructed  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometry of the problem is studied , with the aim of clarifying the structures defining separability @xcite .",
    "two results , one from each approach , deserve special attention .",
    "an operationally simple necessary condition for separability was given by peres  @xcite .",
    "he pointed out that the partial transpose of a separable state is again a separable state , therfore we know that a state is entangled if its partial transpose is not positive semidefinite . states with positive partial transpose , so called ppt states , are interesting in their own right  @xcite .",
    "a significant geometrical result is that of yczkowski  _ et al .  _",
    "that the volume of separable states is nonzero  @xcite .",
    "they prove the existence of a ball of separable states surrounding the maximally mixed state .",
    "the maximal radius of this ball was provided by gurvits and barnum  @xcite .",
    "the well known necessary and sufficient separability condition in terms of positive linear maps or entanglement witnesses connects these two lines of thought  @xcite .",
    "there exists a set of linear maps on states , or equivalently a set of observables called entanglement witnesses , that may detect , or witness , entanglement of a state .",
    "this result is the point of departure for almost all research into the problem , be it computational , operational or geometrical .",
    "the major obstacle in the application of positive linear maps and entanglement witnesses is that they are difficult to identify , in principle as difficult as are the entangled states themselves .",
    "our contribution falls in the line of geometrical studies of entanglement .",
    "the ultimate goal is to classify the extremal points of the convex set of entanglement witnesses , the building blocks of the set , in a manner useful for purposes in quantum mechanics .",
    "positive linear maps , and the extremal positive maps , were studied already in 1963 by strmer in the context of partially ordered vector spaces and @xmath8  algebras  @xcite . since then",
    "the extremal positive maps and extremal witnesses have only received scattered attention  @xcite .",
    "here we combine and apply basic notions from convex geometry and optimization theory in order to study the extremal entanglement witnesses .",
    "we obtain computationally useful necessary and sufficient conditions for extremality .",
    "we use these ideas to analyse previously known examples and construct new numerical examples of extremal witnesses .",
    "the extremal witnesses found in random searches are generic , by definition .",
    "it turns out that the previously known examples of extremal witnesses are very far from being generic , and the generic extremal witness is of a type not yet published in the literature .",
    "we discuss what we learn about the geometry of the set of witnesses , and also the set of separable states , by studying extremal witnesses .",
    "other topics we comment on are the relation bewteen extremal and optimal witnesses  @xcite , and the so called structural physical approximation ( spa ) of witnesses relating them to physical maps of states  @xcite .",
    "numerical methods play a central role in our work .",
    "an important reason is that the entanglement witnesses we want to study are so complicated that there is little hope of treating them analytically .",
    "numerical work is useful for illustrating the theory , examining questions of interest and guiding our thoughts in questions we can not answer rigorously .",
    "the methods we use for studying extremal witnesses are essentially the same as we have used previously for studying extremal states with positive partial transpose ( ppt states )  @xcite .",
    "the work presented here is also based in part on the master s thesis of one of us @xcite .",
    "this article consists of three main parts .",
    "section  [ sec : intro ] is the first part , where we review material necessary for the appreciation of later sections .",
    "the basic concepts of convex geometry are indispensable .",
    "we review the geometry of entanglement witnesses , and formulate the study of extremal witnesses as an optimization problem where we represent the witness as a positive semidefinite biquadratic form and study its zeros .",
    "the second part consists of section  [ sec : constraints ] and section  [ sec : extremal ] , where we develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the extremality of a witness .",
    "the basic idea is that every zero of a positive biquadratic form representing a witness imposes strong linear constraints on the form .",
    "the extremality condition in terms of the zeros of a witness and the associated constraints is our most important result , not only because it gives theoretical insight , but because it is directly useful for numerical computations .    in the third , last , and most voluminous part ,",
    "the sections  [ sec : decompwitnesses ] to  [ sec : real ] , we apply the extremality condition from section  [ sec : extremal ] . as a first application we study decomposable witnesses in section  [ sec : decompwitnesses ]",
    "these are well understood and not very useful as witnesses , since they can only detect the entanglement of a state in the trivial case when its partial transpose is not positive .",
    "but they serve to illustrate the concepts , and we find them useful as stepping stones towards nondecomposable witnesses .",
    "in section  [ sec : knownexamples ] we study examples of extremal nondecomposable witnesses .",
    "first we study two examples known from the literature , and confirm their extremality by our numerical method .",
    "then we construct numerically random examples of extremal witnesses in order to learn about their properties .",
    "we find that the generic extremal witnesses constructed numerically belong almost without exception to a completely new class , not previously noticed in the literature .",
    "they have a fixed number of isolated quadratic zeros , whereas the previously published extremal witnesses have continuous sets of zeros .",
    "the number of zeros depends on the dimensions of the hilbert spaces of the two subsystems .    in section  [ sec : dshapedi ]",
    "we show examples of a special d - shaped type of faces of the set of witnesses in the lowest nontrivial dimensions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . these faces are `` next to extremal '' , bordered by extremal witnesses plus a straight section of decomposable witnesses .    in section  [ sec",
    ": separable ] we study faces of the set of separable states , using the duality between separable states and witnesses .",
    "we classify two different families of faces , generalizing results of alfsen and shultz  @xcite , and present some statistics on randomly generated maximal simplex faces .",
    "we point out that the facial structure is relevant for the question of how many pure product states are needed in the convex decomposition of an arbitrary separable state , and suggest that it may be possible to improve substantially the trivial bound given by the dimension of the set  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : optimal ] we compare the notions of optimal and extremal witnesses  @xcite . in low dimensions we find that almost every nondecomposable optimal witness is extremal , whereas an abundance of nondecomposable and nonextremal optimal witnesses exist in higher dimensions .",
    "in section  [ sec : spa ] we comment on a separability conjecture regarding structural physical approximations ( spas ) of optimal witnesses  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has since been refuted  @xcite . we have tried to test numerically a modified separability conjecture .",
    "it holds within the numerical precision of our separability test , but this test with the available precision is clearly not a definitive proof .    in section  [ sec : real ] we point out that it is possible , and maybe even natural from a certain point of view , to treat the entanglement witnesses on a complex tensor product space as a subset of the witnesses on a real tensor product space .    in section  [ sec",
    ": conclusion ] we summarize our work and suggest some possible directions for future efforts .",
    "some details regarding numerical methods are found in the appendix .",
    "in this section we review material necessary as background for the following sections .",
    "convex geometry is the mathematical basis of the theory of mixed quantum states , and is equally basic in the entanglement theory for mixed states .",
    "we introduce the concepts of dual convex cones , entanglement witnesses , positive maps , and biquadratic forms .",

    "@xmath370 is the estimated minimum number of zeros required for a quadratic witness to be extremal , assuming maximal independence of constraints .",
    "@xmath369 is the actual number of independent constraints from @xmath370 random product vectors .",
    "note that for @xmath371 there is an intrinsic degeneracy causing the number of constraints from @xmath370 zeros to be @xmath385 , so the actual minimum number of zeros is @xmath386 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the question whether the spa @xmath387 of a witness @xmath1 is a separable state is interesting because separability simplifies the physical implementation of the map @xmath388 . since the original separability conjecture of korbicz _ et al .",
    "_ fails , a natural question is whether the spa is always separable when it is a ppt state .",
    "again there are counterexamples , as mentioned  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these counterexamples are rather special , and there remains a possibility that the spa of a generic extremal witness with only quadratic zeros could be separable if it is a ppt state .",
    "for this reason , in our numerical examples we have tried to check the separability of the spa whenever it is a ppt state .",
    "we find that it is always very close to being separable , in no case are we able to conclude that it is certainly not separable .",
    "unfortunately , our numerical separability test is not sufficiently precise that we may state with any conviction the opposite conclusion that the state is separable .    in conclusion , we do not know to what extent a modified spa separability conjecture holds , which excludes the states that are not ppt states . on the other hand ,",
    "if we regard separability as an essential property of the spa , it seems that the natural solution would be to define the spa by the parameter value @xmath389 , where @xmath390 first becomes separable , rather than by the value @xmath391 , where @xmath390 first becomes positive .",
    "we want to outline here a different approach to the problem of describing the convex cone @xmath94 of entanglement witnesses , where we regard it as a real rather than a complex problem .",
    "this means that we treat @xmath99 as a subset of a higher dimensional compact convex set .",
    "we are motivated by the observation that the problem is intrinsically real , since @xmath51 is a real vector space , @xmath392 is a real valued function , and some of the constraints discussed in section  [ sec : constraints ] are explicitly real . in particular , the second derivative matrix , the hessian , defining constraints at a quartic zero of a witness is a real and not a complex matrix .",
    "another motivation is the possibility of expressing the extremal points of @xmath99 as convex combinations of extremal points of the larger set . as an example",
    "we show how a pure state as a witness is a convex combination of real witnesses that are not of the complex form .    in order to arrive at an explicitly real formulation of the problem we proceed as follows .",
    "define @xmath393 and @xmath394 as @xmath395 and define @xmath396 then if @xmath397 and @xmath398 we have that @xmath399 since @xmath400 is a hermitian matrix , its real part is symmetric and its imaginary part antisymmetric .",
    "the expectation value @xmath401 is real because only the symmetric part of @xmath400 contributes .",
    "furthermore , only the part of @xmath400 that is symmetric under partial transposition contributes .",
    "hence @xmath402 when we define @xmath403 since @xmath404 is an @xmath405 matrix , @xmath400 is a @xmath406 matrix , @xmath407 where @xmath408 is a @xmath409 matrix , @xmath410 the partial transposition of @xmath400 transposes submatrices of size @xmath411 .    we may now replace the complex biquadratic form @xmath392 by the real form @xmath412 , and repeat the analysis in section  [ sec : constraints ] almost unchanged . we therefore see that complex witnesses in dimension @xmath413 correspond naturally to real witnesses in @xmath414 .",
    "write the matrix elements of @xmath1 as @xmath415 in this notation , @xmath416 is an @xmath417 submatrix of the @xmath418 matrix @xmath1 .",
    "then we have that @xmath419 the complex matrix @xmath416 may always be decomposed as @xmath420 where @xmath421 are real matrices , and @xmath422 are symmetric , @xmath423 are antisymmetric .",
    "the hermiticity of @xmath1 means that @xmath424 or equivalently , @xmath425 in particular , @xmath426    we finally arrive at the following explicit relation between the complex witness @xmath1 and the real witness @xmath427 , @xmath428 with @xmath429 note that the @xmath411 matrices @xmath430 and @xmath431 are symmetric by construction , @xmath432 and @xmath433 .",
    "this means that @xmath427 is symmetric under partial transposition , @xmath434 .",
    "it also follows from the equations  ( [ eq : uikvik ] ) and  ( [ eq : abcdikki ] ) that @xmath435 and @xmath436 .",
    "this means that the @xmath409 matrix @xmath437 is symmetric , @xmath438 because @xmath439 whereas @xmath440 is antisymmetric , @xmath441 because @xmath442 this means that @xmath427 is symmetric , @xmath443 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a pure state , @xmath444 with @xmath445 , then @xmath446 with @xmath447 we have seen that @xmath1 is extremal in @xmath99 , but we see now that it is not extremal in the larger set of real witnesses that are not of the complex form given in equation  ( [ eq : wuv ] ) .",
    "write @xmath448 with @xmath449 real , and @xmath450 with @xmath451 here @xmath452 is a @xmath453 matrix , and if we write @xmath454 with @xmath455 for the submatrices of size @xmath456 , we have that @xmath457 with @xmath458 we now have that @xmath459 with @xmath460 these two matrices are symmetric , @xmath461 and @xmath462 , but we should also make them symmetric under partial transposition . therefore we replace them by the matrices @xmath463 where @xmath464",
    "in this article we have approached the problem of distinguishing entangled quantum states from separable states through the related problem of classifying and understanding entanglement witnesses .",
    "we have studied in particular the extremal entanglement witnesses from which all other witnesses may be constructed .",
    "we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a witness to be extremal , in terms of the zeros and hessian zeros of the witness , and in terms of linear constraints on the witness imposed by the existence of zeros .",
    "the extremality conditions lead to systematic methods for constructing numerical examples of extremal witnesses .",
    "we find that the distinction between quadratic and quartic zeros is all important when we classify extremal witnesses .",
    "nearly all extremal witnesses found in random searches are quadratic , having only quadratic zeros .",
    "there is a minimum number of zeros a quadratic witness must have in order to be extremal , and most of the quadratic extremal witnesses have this minimum number of zeros . to our knowledge , extremal witnesses of this type",
    "have never been observed before , even though they are by far the most common .    the number of zeros of a quadratic extremal witness increases faster than the hilbert space dimension .",
    "since a witness is optimal if its zeros span the hilbert space , this implies that in all but the lowest dimensions witnesses may be optimal and yet be very far from extremal .",
    "the facial structures of the convex set of separable states and the convex set of witnesses are closely related .",
    "the zeros of a witness , whether quadratic or quartic , always define an exposed face of the set of separable states .",
    "the other way around , an exposed face of the set of separable states is defined by a set of pure product states that are the zeros of some witness , in fact , they are the common zeros of all the witnesses in a face of the set of witnesses . the existence of witnesses with quartic zeros is the root of the existence of nonexposed faces of the set of witnesses .",
    "it is unknown to us whether the set of separable states has unexposed faces .",
    "one possible way to test whether or not a given state is separable is to try to decompose it as a convex combination of pure product states .",
    "in such a test it is of great practical importance to know the number of pure product states that is needed in the worst case .",
    "the general theorem of carathodory provides a limit of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dimension of the set , but this is a rather large number , and an interesting unsolved problem is to improve this limit , if possible .",
    "we point out that this is a question closely related to the facial structure of the set of separable states , which in turn is related to the set of entanglement witnesses .",
    "another unsolved problem we may mention here again is the following . we have found a procedure for constructing an extremal witness from its zeros and hessian zeros , but an arbitrarily chosen set of zeros and hessian zeros does not in general define an extremal entanglement witness .",
    "how do we construct an extremal witness by choosing a set of zeros and hessian zeros we want it to have ?",
    "clearly this is a much more complicated problem than the trivial problem of constructing a polynomial in one variable from its zeros .    in conclusion , by studying the extremal entanglement witnesses we have made some small progress towards understanding the convex sets of witnesses and separable mixed states .",
    "but this has also made the complexity of the problem even more clear than it was before .",
    "the main complication is the fact that zeros of extremal witnesses may be quartic , since this opens up an almost unlimited range of variability among the quartic witnesses .",
    "a full understanding of this variability seems a very distant goal .",
    "nevertheless we believe that it is useful to pursue the study of extremal witnesses in order to learn more about the geometry of the set of separable states , and it is rather clear that a combination of analytical and numerical methods will be needed also in future work .",
    "given a zero @xmath182 , let @xmath465 for @xmath466 be the column vectors of the matrix @xmath467 .",
    "we construct them for example from an orthonormal basis @xmath468 of @xmath469 , taking @xmath470 , @xmath471 for @xmath472 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath473 for @xmath474 be the column vectors of @xmath475 .",
    "then the equations @xmath238 , @xmath239 may be written as @xmath476    with @xmath250 @xmath477 and @xmath256 , @xmath257 , for @xmath478 , the constraints @xmath479 given in equation   may be written explicitly as follows , @xmath480    system @xmath263 can be written as follows .",
    "for any linear combinations @xmath481 with real coefficients",
    "@xmath482 and @xmath483 as above , we have @xmath484 this is one single constraint for each set of coefficients @xmath482 .",
    "the minimum number of different linear combinations that we have to use is given by the binomial coefficient @xmath485",
    "in this section we describe some possibilities for solving the optimization problem . this question has received little attention in the physics community , and in the optimization literature focus shifted towards a rigorous rather than towards an `` applied '' approach .",
    "two comments are in place . in  @xcite and",
    "@xcite simple algorithms were presented which in our experience work fine in most situations . however , when applied to algorithm  [ alg : findextrwitn ] we repeatedly observe poor convergence , presumably due to degeneracies of eigenvalues . in @xcite it is stated that a straight forward parametrization of problem can not be solved in an efficient manner .",
    "instead they present a formalism which again , in our view , is unnecessarily complicated for low dimensions .",
    "the conceptually simplest approach is to perform repeated local minimization from random starting points , thus heuristically ( though sufficiently safe ) obtaining all global optimal points .",
    "below we describe different possible approaches for local minimization , either applying available optimization algorithms or implementing simple ones ourselves .    in the case",
    "that only the optimal value @xmath163 and not the optimal solution @xmath486 is sought for , a positive maps approach is fruitful . given an operator @xmath63 one can define the linear map @xmath137 such that @xmath487 problem is then equivalent to minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath488 as a function of normalized @xmath6 , and hence to the unconstrained minimization of @xmath489 with a real parametrization @xmath397 as in equation this function is readily minimized by the nelder ",
    "mead downhill simplex algorithm , listed _",
    "e.g.  _ in @xcite and implemented _ e.g.  _ in matlab s `` fminsearch '' @xcite function or mathematica s `` nminimize '' @xcite .    in the case that also the optimal point @xmath486 is sought for several possibilities exist .",
    "an approximate solution is easily found by feeding the real problem given by to a sqp - algorithm @xcite , _",
    "e.g.  _ the one provided in matlab s `` fmincon '' function @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to apply the infinity norm in and perform box - constrained minimization in each face of the @xmath490-ball .",
    "since the hessian of the function is readily available trust - region algorithms are suitable ( also provided in matlab s `` fmincon '' ) .",
    "if @xmath65 is known to be a witness , even the box - constraints on each face of the @xmath490-ball can be removed , since in that case the objective function is bounded below .",
    "the problem has then been reduced to unconstrained minimization in a series of affine spaces , one for each face of the @xmath490-ball . with this latter formulation",
    ", we have had success with a quasi - newton approach @xcite performing exact line search , see @xcite for details .",
    "further , we have had promising results with a complex conjugate gradient algorithm also performing exact line search @xcite , though further development is necessary .",
    "given a quadratic witness @xmath1 situated in the interior of a face defined by @xmath491 product vectors , and a perturbation @xmath109 , we define a family of functions as follows .",
    "consider problem with @xmath492 . given all local minima , sort these in ascending order according to function value .",
    "then the function @xmath493 is the value of local minimum number @xmath494 if this exists and 0 otherwise .",
    "function @xmath495 , @xmath496 is the smallest positive eigenvalue of @xmath497 evaluated at zero number @xmath498 .",
    "now each @xmath495 , @xmath499 is a function with a single simple root in @xmath500 which can be easily located using any standard rootfinding technique .",
    "another possible approach to finding the boundary of the face is as follows . rather than locating all local minima of problem , aim only at locating the global minimum value",
    "this global minimum value as a function of @xmath1 will be called the face function .",
    "the face function is zero on a face , positive in the interior of @xmath94 and negative outside of @xmath94 .",
    "finding some initial @xmath501 then allows for one - sided extrapolation towards @xmath502 .",
    "if we employ the 2-norm for the constraints in the face function is concave as a function of @xmath503 . to see this , note that the optimal value of problem is equal to the optimal value of @xmath504",
    "let @xmath505 denote the optimal value .",
    "since @xmath505 is defined as a point - wise minimum @xmath505 is a concave function of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "projection of @xmath1 on some face is an affine operation , an operation preserving concavity .",
    "accordingly the face function is a concave function once the new local minimum exists .",
    "this fact makes either approach for locating the boundary of a face simpler , since the qualitative form of the function whose root to find is known .",
