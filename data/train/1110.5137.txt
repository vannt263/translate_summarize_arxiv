    "in physical chemistry , thermodynamics and condensed matter physics , a critical point specifies the conditions ( temperature , pressure and concentration ) at which distinct phases do not exist @xcite .",
    "there are multiple types of critical points such as vapor - liquid or liquid - liquid critical point .",
    "a single fluid has a unique critical point associated with given temperature , pressure and density . for binary mixtures of fluids , in the space of temperature , pressure , concentration ,",
    "critical points are represented by a curve in a convenient domain @xcite ; to each temperature we can associate a critical pressure and two critical densities corresponding to the mixture components @xcite .",
    "an important thermodynamical potential is related to the mixture volume free energy @xcite . at a given temperature ,",
    "the volume free energy is associated with the _ spinodal _ curve connecting the two different phases of the binary mixture .",
    "due to conditions of equilibrium of phases , it is possible to form a general expansion of the free energy near a critical point .",
    "this form is known in the literature by means of physical chemistry considerations @xcite and is the form we use in our calculations .    by calculations in molecular theories ,",
    "the densities of the components fluctuate near a critical point @xcite . in the following , we use a continuous model to investigate how the average variations of densities are related to molecular interactions .",

    "the correlation lengths are assumed to be greater than intermolecular distances @xcite ; this is the case when at a given temperature @xmath1 the parameters are close to the ones of a critical state @xcite.@xmath2  the binary mixture is considered in the framework of a mean - field theory .",
    "this means , in particular , that the free energy of the mixture is a classical so - called `` gradient square functional '' .",
    "this kind of landau - ginzburg model consisting of a quadratic form of the density gradients comes from maxwell and van der walls original ideas korteweg , maxwell , vdw , widom . at given critical conditions ,",
    "the coefficients of the quadratic form are constant .",
    "this point of view that , in non - homogeneous regions , the mixture may be treated as bulk phase with a local free - energy density and an additional contribution arising from the non - uniformity which may be approximated by a gradient expansion truncated at the second order is most likely to be successful and perhaps even quantitatively accurate near a critical point @xcite . the approximation of mean field theory does provide a good understanding and allows one to explicitly calculate the magnitude of the coefficients of the model .",
    "these non - linear equations are able to represent interface layer and bulks and consequently allow to build a complete theory of the mixtures in non - homogeneous domains in dynamics .",
    "in section 2 we recall the equations of motion in a pure mechanical process obtained through the hamilton variational principle .",
    "section 3 is devoted to travelling waves without dissipation . due to the fact that the equations are galilean invariant , the case of equilibrium and the case of motion",
    "are analyzed together .    in section 4 by means of a rescaling process taking the vicinity of a critical point into account , we integrate the equation for equilibrium as well as for motions with dissipation .",
