    "uplink co - ordinated multi - point ( comp ) is a promising technique for increasing the capacity of 4 g networks @xcite .",
    "the uplink is gaining increasing attention due to the dramatic increase of user - generated data in the form of photos , videos and file - sharing . in practice ,",
    "sharing of uplink received signals across cells is limited by backhaul bandwidth .",
    "in addition , the receiver _ aperture _ , or number of signals from antennas at neighboring cell sites that can be processed at a particular cell , may be limited due to hardware constraints .",
    "several approaches for signal sharing and combining have been proposed for uplink comp .",
    "a performance analysis of different combining methods with different backhaul bandwidth requirements is presented in @xcite . to reduce",
    "the amount of sharing , dynamic clustering of cells has been proposed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "in addition to limiting the amount of information that can be shared across cells , the limited backhaul bandwidth also introduces latency , which is addressed in @xcite .",
    "previous work on comp has generally assumed that the set of cells that share information is fixed _ a priori _ by the topology and the bandwidth of the backhaul links . in this paper",
    "we relax this assumption and consider the problem of _ optimizing _ _ sets _ of _ helper _ cells that pass along their uplink signals to other cells .",
    "( a cell can both share its signals as a helper cell and receive signals , or help from other cells . )",
    "we account for architectural constraints that limit the set of potential helper cells ( which differs from cell to cell ) , backhaul constraints that limit the number of cells to which a helper cell can send its received signals ( _ egress _ constraint ) , and hardware constraints at the cell site , which may limit the number of incoming signals the cell can combine ( _ ingress _ constraint ) .",
    "related work in @xcite has considered the problem of mmse receiver estimation under compression and backhaul constraints .",
    "we focus here instead on a simpler sharing formulation that introduces explicit constraints on egress bandwidth , to arrive at a convex weighted sum rate formulation with guaranteed convergence . imposing these explicit egress bandwidth and ingress aperture constraints",
    "captures important architectural limitations in centralized or distributed co - operative networks .",
    "our problem is then to maximize a sum rate objective subject to these architectural constraints .",
    "since the cell sites are assumed to have multiple antennas , we refer to this problem as _ multi - antenna aperture selection ( maas ) _ for joint reception ( jr)-comp ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the optimization of sets of helper cells is an integer program . assuming max - ratio combining of received signals and relaxing the integer constraints",
    ", the optimization problem becomes convex .",
    "we present a distributed algorithm in which each helper cell announces an _ egress price _ , indicating the demand for its signals to help other cells , and each assisted cell computes an _ ingress price _ , indicating the potential improvement from adding a helper cell .",
    "the prices are used to compute an ordering of users / cells , which is then used to allocate the helper antennas across assisted cells .",
    "this assignment is iterated with updates for the prices .",
    "we refer to this algorithm as _ liquidmaas _ due to its ability to flexibly allocate help based on network load conditions , and show that it converges to the optimal allocation of helper cells across the network .",
    "numerical results are presented that show that the algorithm converges in relatively few iterations even for a system with a large number of cells .",
    "furthermore , the gains relative to an _ a priori _ fixed allocation of helper cells can be substantial .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 cells , each with multiple antennas .",
    "each cell @xmath1 serves a set of users @xmath2 .",
    "the uplink signal from each user @xmath3 is typically strongest at its serving cell ; however , the signal could also be received with significant strength at other cells depending on the user location and network topology .",
    "we assume the antenna - combined signal for a particular user @xmath3 can be shared with other cells , and is , of course , provided to that user s serving cell for comp combining .",
    "figure ( [ cell - topology ] ) shows an example of a network with uplink data sharing .",
    "there are four cells with seven users , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the set of cells with data that can be requested by the cell serving user @xmath9 ( _ ingress _ neighborhood ) .",
    "that typically corresponds to the set of cells where the user s sinr is above a minimum threshold value ( usually -10 db ) .",
    "that is , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the sinr at cell @xmath12 for a user @xmath9 in cell @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 is the serving cell for user @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath8 may not be the actual set of helper cells for user @xmath9 due to backhaul and aperture constraints .    also shown in",
    "figure ( [ cell - topology ] ) are the possible sharing variables along with the inter - connect .",
    "note that cells 1 and 3 , and cells 2 and 4 do not exchange information .",
    "the sharing variable @xmath15 indicates whether or not cell @xmath12 shares data for user @xmath9 in cell @xmath1 over the backhaul link @xmath16 .",
    "for the example shown in figure ( [ cell - topology ] ) , the local neighborhood sets for the different users are @xmath17    the maximum receiver aperture size , or number of helper cells , for user @xmath9 is denoted as @xmath18 , and is the number of cells in the neighborhood @xmath19 . for a cell @xmath12 , its _ egress _ neighborhood to cell @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath20 , and is the set of users in cell @xmath1 it can potentially help , ignoring backhaul and aperture constraints .",
    "that is : @xmath21 for the example in figure ( [ cell - topology ] ) , @xmath22 .",
    "the egress neighborhoods are : @xmath23 note that if there is no possibility of sharing between two cells , then the corresponding egress set is null , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath24 .",
    "the notation is summarized in table [ table ] .",
    ".variable definitions [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    users were allocated bandwidth equally based on the number of users connected to a given cell .",
    "a user s sinr to all cells in the network was calculated based on this bandwidth allocation , and open - loop fractional power control @xcite was assumed .",
    "the update for @xmath25 and @xmath26 used a step - size of @xmath27 .",
    "four algorithms were evaluated : _ ( 1 ) no comp , ( 2 ) maas without egress constraints , ( 3 ) maas with a randomized egress bandwidth control mechanism , and ( 4 ) liquidmaas_. in case _",
    "( 2 ) _ , each cell requests help based on their aperture limit , and helper cells grant any requested help . in _ ( 3 ) _ , helper cells randomly grant requests for help until their egress constraint limit is reached .",
    "the ingress aperture constraint limit was set to @xmath28 , so that each user being gets a maximum of @xmath29 helper cells data .",
    "the egress bandwidth limit @xmath30 was varied to see the effect on performance and convergence .",
    "the top part of figure ( [ fig2 ] ) shows the convergence behavior of all cells egress bandwidth demand ( for @xmath31 ) , from which we observe that the algorithm converges in @xmath32 iterations .",
    "the convergence time is dependent on the step - size for updating the prices .",
    "it was observed that if the aperture and egress limits are similar , the step - size should be reduced to enable smoother convergence .",
    "the bottom part of figure ( [ fig2 ] ) shows the distribution of weighted sum rate ( wsr ) gain obtained by the various comp approaches .",
    "this shows that liquidmaas gives substantial gain over no comp and also over the randomized egress bandwidth control strategy .",
    "figure ( [ fig3 ] ) shows the distribution of the egress bandwidth and ingress apertures at convergence .",
    "we observe that the liquidmaas algorithm maintains tight control over the egress bandwidth , and adapts the ingress aperture to ensure that the constraints are met .",
    "finally , figure ( [ fig4 ] ) shows the average wsr gain ( over no comp ) as a function of the egress limit ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "liquidmaas gives significant gains across the range of egress limits compared to the randomized strategy , and converges to the unconstrained maas solution for larger values of @xmath30 .",

    "in this paper , we presented an approach for joint algorithm and architecture optimization for co - operative communication networks .",
    "we considered the problem of uplink joint reception comp with backhaul bandwidth constraints , and showed that the resulting network utility maximization problem is convex . a distributed algorithm to solve this problem",
    "was presented , which consisted of local nodes computing their desired helper requests , followed by helper cells computing and updating an egress price for their bandwidth . at convergence ,",
    "these iterations give a set of connections between helper and recipient cells , such that egress and ingress constraints are met at all cells , and overall network utility is maximized .",
    "simulation results for a 57-cell system were presented to illustrate the efficacy of the approach , and show that the distributed dual decomposition - based gradient algorithm converges within tens of iterations .",
