    "the development and progress of the techniques to study ultra - cold atomic systems has made them an ideal and clean platform to investigate condensed matter systems . they allow to tune the relevant interactions in a large range and consequently to explore the phase diagrams of these many - body systems .",
    "more recently , the spin - orbit interaction has been implemented in cold atoms@xcite revealing still richer phase diagrams .",
    "this interaction allows for quantum phase transitions which do not present the usual symmetry - breaking phenomenon of the landau paradigm and are best characterized in terms of topological transitions .",
    "this work focus on the study of asymmetric superconductors  @xcite , where different types of quasi - particles , the electrons arising from different orbitals , coexist at a common fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "these may also be atomic systems , with atoms in different nuclear states  @xcite or colored superconductors , as found in the core of neutron stars  @xcite , where the particles are different quarks .    a common parameter that characterizes asymmetric superfluids is the mismatch @xmath1 between the fermi wave - vectors associated with different quasi - particles .",
    "the quantum phase diagram of these superfluids in the limit of very large mismatches where , even at @xmath2 , they are in the normal phase has been previously investigated  @xcite . as the mismatch is _ reduced _ they present an instability to an inhomogeneous superfluid state characterized by a space modulated order parameter , known as fflo phase  @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the opposite limit of small mismatches where the ground state is a homogeneous superfluid .",
    "we consider a two - band metal with inter - band attractive interactions and hybridization between them . in the case",
    "these bands are spin - up and down bands of a system polarized by a uniform magnetic field , we show that under certain conditions , a @xmath0-dependent hybridization is formally equivalent to a spin - orbit interaction between the polarized bands .",
    "our results on the influence of hybridization on superconductivity have remarkable implications .",
    "whenever hybridization occurs among orbitals with different parities , as @xmath3 or @xmath4 orbitals , we show that it enhances superconductivity and promotes a crossover from pure bcs to a strong coupling bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of pairs .",
    "the case of @xmath3 hybridization is relevant for the high-@xmath5 superconductors  @xcite and that of @xmath4 for heavy fermion materials  @xcite .",
    "since hybridization can be controlled by doping or pressure our results have exciting consequences for these systems .",
    "the problem of superfluidity in the presence of spin orbit interaction has recently received a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "the general approach is to introduce the _ helicity basis _ in which the kinetic part of the hamiltonian together with the zeeman and spin - orbit terms are diagonal .",
    "next a bcs decoupling is used to deal with the many - body attractive interaction which is written in the helicity basis  @xcite . the superfluid order parameter now contains _ triplet _ and _ singlet _ contributions arising from pairing states with the same or opposite helicities , respectively  @xcite . here",
    "we treat all terms of the hamiltonian , that consist of the kinetic part , the hybridization or soc , the bcs decoupled attractive interaction and the zeeman term on the same footing .",
    "this allows us to consider a single order parameter instead of several pairing amplitudes that arise in the helicity basis  @xcite .",
    "of course both methods should yield equivalent results , as we discuss below . furthermore , as a mathematical tool , instead of using generalized bogoliubov transformations , we use green s functions and the equations of motion method .",
    "we consider a model with two types of quasi - particles , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , arising from different atomic orbitals with an attractive inter - band interaction @xmath8 , and a hybridization term @xmath9 that mixes different quasi - particles states  @xcite .",
    "this one - body mixing term @xmath10 is related to the overlap of the wave functions on the same or neighboring sites and can be tuned by external parameters , like pressure or doping .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are creation operators for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 quasi - particles , respectively and @xmath14 .",
    "the dispersion relations @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , where we allow for different masses and chemical potentials .",
    "we set @xmath17 .",
    "the motivation for considering inter - band attractive interactions is that , as argued by many authors , in heavy fermions the main contribution to superconductivity is due to hybrid or inter - orbital pairs involving f - electrons and conduction electrons , which arise from the dominant kondo interaction  @xcite . for the copper oxides in some versions of the @xmath18 model  @xcite",
    ", it is argued that the @xmath18 interaction has a predominant role  @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of the above hamiltonian is that if the bands @xmath6 and @xmath7 are taken as the up - spin and down - spin bands of a single band system polarized by an external magnetic field @xmath19 , the hybridization term now mixes different spin states .",
    "then , depending on the symmetry properties of @xmath10 , this problem becomes formally similar to that of a non - centrosymmetric system in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction  @xcite as we discuss below .",
    "thus , hamiltonian , eq .  [ eq01 ] describes either a hybridized two - band system or a polarized single band material with spin - dependent tunneling . in both cases",
    ", there is an attractive interaction between the different quasi - particles .",
    "notice that in spite of the formal similarity , spin degrees of freedom are important and distinguish the two - problems : the hybridization problem , which mixes fermions in different bands with the same spin and the spin - orbit rashba interaction that mixes fermions in the same orbital band but with different spins .",
    "this distinction becomes most important in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we will consider here the ground state phase diagram and topological properties of a 3d s - wave superfluid described by eq .",
    "the order parameter that characterizes the superfluid phase is , @xmath20 .    within the bcs approximation , eq .",
    "[ eq01 ] can be exactly diagonalized , either using a generalized bogoliubov transformation or using the equations of motion for the green s function  @xcite . here",
    "we use the latter method and obtain the anomalous correlation functions @xmath21 from the corresponding anomalous greens function , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the poles of the green s function also yield the spectrum of excitations in the superconducting phase .",
    "excitonic types of correlations that simply renormalize the hybridization @xcite are neglected .",
    "finally , the anomalous frequency dependent propagator , from which the order parameter can be self - consistently obtained , is given by @xcite ,  @xmath23 as we will see below , the values of the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on a crucial manner in the symmetry properties of the hybridization @xmath10 under space inversion symmetry .",

    "anti - symmetric hybridization can occur when one mixes orbitals with angular momenta _",

    "the new quasi - particle operators that diagonalize the kinetic energy terms plus the hybridization involve also a linear combination of the original band operators but _ with the same spin_. a direct consequence of this difference is that in the spin - orbit problem , when the interaction terms of the bcs mean field hamiltonian , @xmath180 are written in terms of the new quasi - particle operators , triplet correlations immediately arise .",

    "the correct bose - einstein condensation temperature is obtained in the strong coupling limit of the bcs - bec crossover only if one goes beyond mean - field and includes the self - energy , which enters in the calculation by considering fluctuations corrections @xcite .",

    "however , the main point here is that we showed that even for a _ fixed weak - coupling interaction _ , where fluctuations are negligible , the bcs - bec crossover can be reached by varying the strength of hybridization , as shown in fig .  [ fig9 ] .",
    "here we mention briefly the case with attractive intra - band interactions , in the narrow @xmath7-band only , and for odd parity hybridization .",
    "the condition for zero modes is given by  @xcite , @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the superconducting order parameter in our notation .",
    "then , in this case there are no zero modes unless the hybridization vanishes at the fermi wave - vector of the @xmath6-band .",
    "it turns out from the calculations that the energy of the excitations in the superconducting phase for symmetric and anti - symmetric ( odd parity ) hybridizations are formally the same and differ only by the specific functional form of @xmath183 .",
    "furthermore , considering just the intra - band attractive interaction and a hybridization term , we find induced inter - band pairing correlations due to the hybridization in the form  @xcite , @xmath184 .",

    "notice that induced gaps do not appear in the zero mode equations .",
    "instead of diagonalizing the full hamiltonian , eq .",
    "[ eq01 ] , with the attractive interaction treated in the bcs approximation , it is a common approach in the literature @xcite to use the helicity basis and write the attractive interaction in this basis .",

    "we have studied the effects of hybridization on superconductivity in a two - band system with inter - band interactions .",
    "we focused in the limit of small mismatches between the fermi wave - vectors of these bands , where the system is always a superfluid at @xmath2 .",
    "hybridization is a key concept in chemistry and solid state physics . in the latter case",
    "it arises from the mixing of different orbitals by the crystalline potential .",
    "it can occur locally , at an atomic site , for non - orthogonal wave - functions , as in the case of @xmath204 and @xmath205 mixing . here",
    "the @xmath206-state is a plane wave containing all the harmonics .",
    "also , it takes place between orbitals in neighboring sites and in this case mixing can involve generic orbitals .",
    "most interesting , as we have shown here , is when it occurs in neighboring sites between orbitals with different parities , as for these with angular momentum _",

    "the @xmath0-dependent hybridizations like @xmath207 and @xmath177 are not invariant under space inversion symmetry , with the anti - symmetric property , @xmath208 or @xmath209 even for inversion symmetric lattices . as we have shown this property of the hybridization",
    "has dramatic effects on superconductivity where the bcs interaction mixes states with opposite momenta  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that anti - symmetric hybridization enhances superconductivity and drives the bcs - bec crossover even at weak coupling . as mixing among the orbitals",
    "can be tuned by doping or external pressure , this turns out to be a controllable mechanism for enhancement of superconductivity . besides , this provides an important parameter to explore the quantum phase diagrams of systems where hybridization is anti - symmetric .",
    "this includes classes of systems which are of great interest as the transition metal oxides in the case of @xmath210 and heavy fermions for @xmath29 hybridization .",
    "we have also shown that the two - band problem with anti - symmetric hybridization is formally equivalent to that of a single band system polarized by an external magnetic field with a spin - orbit rashba coupling between the spin up and down bands .",
    "this is a useful analogy as many concepts from one field can be easily brought to the other .    for completeness",
    ", we have also studied the effect of symmetric hybridization in two - band superconductivity in both weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "we have shown this acts in detriment of superconductivity and gives rise to quantum phases transition from the superfluid to a normal state .",
