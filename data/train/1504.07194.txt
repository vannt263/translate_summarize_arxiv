    "luminous masers which are observed at extragalactic distances are termed _ megamasers _ , and widely appear in either hydroxyl ( oh ; mostly 1665 mhz and 1667 mhz from the hyperfine levels in the ground rotational state @xmath2 ) or water ( 22.23508 ghz ; @xmath3 ) molecules , and are typically associated with mergers , starbursting and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity ( for a review , see lo 2005 ) .",

    "hydroxyl ( oh ) megamasers have been utilized to trace star formation and to estimate the galaxy merger rate ( e.g. darling 2002 ) .",
    "unfortunately , megamasers are rare and the precise relationship between megamasers and global galactic processes remains enigmatic .",
    "so far , over 4000 galaxies have been searched for 22 ghz water emission with only 150 detections and nearly 500 galaxies have been surveyed for hydroxyl emission with 120 detections ( see wagner 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "many attempts to link megamasing of either molecular species to other galaxy observables have largely been met with only modest success ( e.g. darling & giovanelli 2006 ; zhang 2012 ; zhu 2011 ) , but significant connections have been achieved , linking oh megamasers to large dense gas fractions ( darling 2007 ) and water emission to high column densities ( zhang et al .",

    "2013 ) , large x - ray luminosities ( kondrakto e al . 2006 ) and high corrected [ oiii]/h@xmath4 ( constantin 2012 ) .",
    "luminous oh emission is frequently powered by starbursting in lirg / ulirg galaxies while water megamasers are usually associated with agn ( lo 2005 ) .    though agn and starbursting activity frequent the same galactic nucleus ( e.g. dixon & joseph 2011 ; wild et al . 2010 ) , very luminous oh and h@xmath1o emission were not until recently observed in the same galaxy ( wagner 2013 ; tarchi et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter t11 ) .",
    "this observation led to the hypothesis that oh and h@xmath1o exclude each other due to the different and respectively restrictive conditions each molecule demands for masing ( see lo 2005 , lonsdale 2002 ) . however , water emission has since been discovered in multiple regions in arp 299 including arp 299-a ( ic 694 ) , a galactic nucleus also hosting an oh megamaser ( t11 ) . another possible dual megamaser candidate ,",
    "iizw96 , was found in a tentative water detection by wagner ( 2013 ) .",
    "it is thus unclear whether galaxies hosting dual megamasers are experiencing a brief phase of galaxy evolution ( such as a transition from starburst nucleus to an agn ) or whether the relationship between the two megamaser species is more complicated than previously believed .    the frequency of simultaneous oh and h@xmath1o has previously been somewhat badly constrained as many masing galaxies have yet to be searched for emission in the remaining molecule . of the nearly 4500 galaxies searched for maser emission in either molecule ,",
    "@xmath5 have been searched for masers of both species ( see tarchi 2012 ; wagner 2013 ) . of those which have been searched and",
    "have emission in at least one molecule ( @xmath6 ) , the majority ( 38 ) only emit in water while 18 are only oh emitters .",
    "the number of extragalactic oh megamasers surveyed for h@xmath1o emission is thus somewhat under - sampled in the literature .    where previous work has attempted to link megamaser luminosities with galaxy observables ,",
    "ours is the first survey of which we are aware which aims to exclusively address the question of the relationship between the two megamaser species .",
    "here we present results of a survey of known oh megamaser hosts for 22 ghz water emission to probe the dependency of h@xmath1o emission on conditions sufficient for oh megamasers .",
    "our sample is taken from t11 and consists of the subset of their galaxies which are established oh emitters observable by the gbt which had never been observed for h@xmath1o emission or for which significantly tighter upper limits on 22 ghz emission might be obtained . due to observing time limitations , rise times of objects , and rfi , we carried out observations for 22 ghz emission for 47 galaxies hosting oh masers .",
    "figure [ ff ] summarizes nuclear activity and distribution in redshift @xmath7 of sample members .",
    "nuclear activity types are fairly well - represented in @xmath7 , mitigating sensitivity biases for detections in a particular group .",
    "we note that oh megamasers are fairly uniformly distributed in galaxy activity type ( i.e. hii , liner , seyfert ) , occupying roughly the same optical population as ( u)lirg galaxies ( darling & giovanelli 2006 ) , so our sample is decently representative of the oh maser / megamaser population .",
    "observations were carried out at the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) between the dates of feb 27 and april 6 , 2014 under project code agbt14a_381 .",
    "we utilized the gbt spectrometer backend and observed with two 200 mhz bands , the first band being centered on systemic velocity and the second offset by 180 mhz toward lower frequencies .",
    "each band contained 8192 spectral channels giving a velocity resolution of 0.366 km s@xmath8 at 20 ghz .",
    "spectra were taken by nodding between beams 3 and 4 of the kfpa receiver every 2.5 minutes for a 5 minute nod cycle .",
    "the telescope was pointed and focused every 30 - 60 minutes or whenever the telescope slewed more than a total of 10 degrees on the sky .",
    "system temperatures were typically 40 - 60 k. with few exceptions , observations were carried out above elevations of 30@xmath9 over the horizon with objects closer to the horizon experiencing increases in system temperatures and compromises in rms sensitivity .    the project was granted @xmath6 hours of telescope time divided into 8 epochs .",
    "good observing conditions and zenith opacities ( 0.02 - 0.03 ) were enjoyed over the course of the observations .",
    "all objects were observed in ll and rr circular polarizations which were averaged to produce final spectra . to test our setup",
    ", we successfully observed the bright water megamaser in mrk 1029 .",
    "we encountered a bright rfi source from a pair of satellites which prevented observations of all the galaxies on our source list .",
    "we were the first observers to encounter this rfi which likely arose from detecting the side lobes of one or both of these satellites which had recently began servicing nearby locales .",
    "the rfi persisted over our @xmath10 months of observations .",
    "these effects were mitigated by restricting observations to certain portions of the sky .",
    "most data reduction was carried out with gbtidl on nrao green bank computing platforms .",
    "local weather conditions were determined from the gbt cleo tool , which estimates zenith opacities by averaging weather data over 3 surrounding stations .",
    "amplitude calibration was carried out with appropriate calibrators in ott et al .",
    "spectra were then examined band by band and flagged for obvious signs of rfi .",
    "15 of our 61 observed sources were sufficiently damaged by rfi that no constraints on 22 ghz water emission could be achieved .",
    "each of our nod scans in a given observation ( including those across multiple nights of observation ) were then averaged .",
    "non - emitting portions of the averaged spectrum were fit with 3rd order polynomial to flatten baselines . during inspection ,",
    "reference spectra were smoothed with 16 channel boxcar routine to bring out weaker features , though we found that this sometimes introduced spurious spikes in the data .",
    "all apparent signals were verified against the spectrum without reference spectral smoothing .",
    "all spectra were immediately smoothed with a 4 channel boxcar scheme which was successful in eliminating about half the noise .",
    "because masers detected in this paper had a distinctly non - gaussian character , line fluxes were first calculated within gbtidl using their ` stats ` procedure , and then subsequently calculated using a numeric integrator based on simpson s rule .",
    "we assume our survey is sufficiently sensitive to detect the flux from a @xmath11 peak with a fwhm of 2 km s@xmath12 ( approximately 5 channels ; see wagner 2013 ) .",
    "upper limits for isotropic luminosities of masers can then be estimated with the method in bennert et al .",

    "we estimate our errors in calibration to be between @xmath16% .",
    "our observations are summarized in table 2 .",
    "we include all observed sources in this table , including 15 sources badly damaged with rfi , for which upper limits on emission could not be achieved .",
    "note that rms sensitivities reported are 1 @xmath17 for the entire band after boxcar smoothing .",
    "of the 46 uncompromised sources observed , we detect confident water emission toward one source and we set new upper limits for water emission on 45 galaxies , 40 of which have yet to be observed for 22 ghz emission .",
    "we now discuss our sole maser detection .",
    "iizw96 is a complex merger between at least two galaxies .",
    "the oh megamaser is offset from obvious galactic nuclei ( migenes et al .",
    "2012 ) , in a @xmath18 reddish clump of gas .",
    "soft x - ray emission and strong ir emission lines ( goldader et al . 1997 ) suggests this clump is an extra - nuclear , obscured starburst , similar to that found in arp 299 , regions c and c in t11 ( imani et al .",
    "iizw96 resembles arp 299 morphologically : goldader et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observes that both galaxies possess similar projected size ( 10 - 15 kpc ) , and are composed of distinct nuclei which are strongly interacting and are in a similar , very short ( @xmath19 myr )  intermediate \" stage of merging .",
    "water emission toward iizw96 was tentatively detected by wagner ( 2013 ) but could not be confirmed above 5@xmath17 as integration time was only 12 minutes . in figure",
    "[ fig21 ] , we present the iizw96 feature after approximately an hour of integration .",
    "this generous observation time was sufficient to resolve the finer features of the water maser which were not previously detected .",
    "the @xmath20 km s@xmath8 profile exhibits a double - humped character in agreement with wagner ( 2013 ) but we do not detect his two side - lobes .",
    "we also obtain an isotropic luminosity somewhat smaller than wagner ( 2013 ) at @xmath21 but the maser remains very luminous .",
    "this difference might be attributed to wagner s possible inclusion of tentative side bumps in the maser luminosity in addition to uncertainties in wagner s measurement arising from short integration times and possibly to short - term maser variability .",
    "our observation confirms this detection beyond doubt ( @xmath22 ) and establishes iizw96 as the second system to host formal megamasers in both oh and h@xmath1o species .",
    "ripples in the baseline of the spectrum of iizw96 persist after baseline removal .",
    "the residual baseline structure is a time and frequency dependent ripple caused by some combination of rfi and system instability .",
    "wagner ( 2013 ) drew connections between iizw96 and the water feature in ngc 2146 which is associated with star formation . with larger integration times , the line in iizw96 better resembles the profile of arp 299 itself ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we should carefully note , however , that arp 299 s profile contains water emission from several regions within the merger ( not just ic 694 ) and a similar situation could be the case with iizw96 .",
    "because of this and the fact that water emission profiles are time - variable , no conclusive connections between the systems can be made without radio interferometric followups .",
    "as with arp 299 , we do not detect high velocity line emission in iizw96 .",
    "our observations reveal narrow features in the water spectrum of iizw96 . though iizw96 is among the most powerful starbursts known ( inami et al .",
    "2010 ) , there is a possibility it also hosts an obscured agn ( migenes et al .",
    "2012 ) which could provide a pumping mechanism for the maser .",
    "if water emission arises from more than one location in iizw96 , it may make the maser more difficult to detect via interferometric measurements , especially with vlbi , because if the already somewhat low flux is broken up into multiple spatial regions , longer integration times will be required to detect emission from any single region .",
    "however , the narrow lines in the water maser emission may suggest the presence of compact emission which would render such followup worthwhile .",
    "a survey for h@xmath1o emission among oh megamaser hosts poses a problem in that oh megamasers are spread more widely in @xmath7 , rending maser emission more difficult to constrain . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot detection limits of our survey as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath23 gaussian peak with 2 km s@xmath8 fwhm assuming a 1 , 2 and 4 mjy rms noise over the entire 200 mhz band .",
    "superposed on this are the individual upper limits of the masers in our sample , variations in upper limits being derived from system temperatures and differing integration times ( @xmath24 minutes ) .",
    "the location of our megamaser detection is indicated with a cross .",
    "one will note that at very high @xmath7 ( @xmath25 ) , our survey will only be effective in observing masers with @xmath26 .",
    "though such water masers are inherently rare ( see bennert et al . 2009 ) , very luminous water megamasers at high @xmath7 have been detected . with only a few exceptions ( iras 10039 - 3338 , iras 11010 + 4107 , iras 11506 - 3851 , iras 12243 - 0036 , iras 15065 - 1107 , iras",
    "15247 - 0945 ) , our survey does not provide upper bounds on water emission below @xmath27 .",
    "very luminous water masers tend to be associated with agn activity and masers appearing on molecular disks may have velocities far ( 1000s of km s@xmath8 ) displaced from the systemic . at 20 ghz",
    "our 200 mhz bands span a velocity of range of @xmath28 km s@xmath8 centered on the systemic velocity .",
    "our second 200 mhz band offers similar velocity coverage toward lower frequencies covering a total velocity coverage of about ( -4500 km s@xmath8 , + 1500 km s@xmath8 ) . in this particular",
    "regard , our observations are identical to water observations of e.g. braatz ( 2008 ) . in some cases",
    ", rfi prevented full use of the band , so upper bounds on emission were determined from portions of the band near the systemic velocity ( see notes on table 2 ) . in these special cases , our upper bounds do not constrain emission of possible high velocity features .",
    "maser luminosities of agn - pumped water masers can vary dramatically on the timescale of years .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that a fraction of our nondetections arose from missing maser flares .    simply integrating the water megamaser luminosity function ( bennert et al .",
    "2009 ; mckean 2011 ) over the volume of our survey as characterized by our bandwidth of @xmath29 mhz , number of pointings ( 46 ) and field of view ( 2.5 arcmin ) with upper and lower isotropic luminosity limits of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , i.e. assuming the survey is blind , predicts @xmath32 masers with luminosities @xmath33 in our survey volume .",
    "12% of 100,000 monte carlo simulations which treated maser luminosities with our detection limits predicted we would detect at least one maser .",
    "however , with a global detection rate of @xmath34 across all galaxies surveyed in the literature and @xmath35 detection rates among seyfert 2 galaxies , we might estimate the number of detections to be @xmath36 maser detections with @xmath37 detection toward a seyfert 2 type nucleus .",
    "previous to this study , approximately 61 galaxies had been searched for both oh and h@xmath1o emission which also showed emission in one of the two molecules . with 43 observations of galaxies which have never previously been observed , our study nearly doubles this number . in particular , previous to the present study , 35 objects which had been searched in both molecules showed emission in only water while only 18 galaxies showed only hydroxyl .",
    "now a total of 103 galaxies have been searched for emission in both molecules and show emission in at least one maser species , 60 of these being established oh maser hosts .",
    "previous studies have included ugc 5101 as a possible dual megamaser .",
    "a very luminous water maser was detected toward ugc 5101 ( martin 1989 ) , which has not been detected in followup observations ( baan et al . 1992 ) .",

    "of the tentative detections discussed , ugc 5101 is the only maser observation where follow up observations were unsuccessful in detecting a signal . for these reasons ,",
    "we omit ugc 5101 in our analysis , but will provide some discussion on how our results change if the questionable case of ugc 5101 is considered .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] , we plot a `` baldwin , phillips & terlevich '' ( bpt ) diagnostic panel for as many galaxies in our sample as have values for optical spectroscopy line values available in the literature ( lozinskaya et al .",

    "<S> questions surround the connection of luminous extragalactic masers to galactic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the observation that water and hydroxyl megamasers rarely coexist in the same galaxy has given rise to a hypothesis that the two species appear in different phases of nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of simultaneous hydroxyl and water megamaser emission toward ic694 has called this hypothesis into question but , because many megamasers have not been surveyed for emission in the other molecule , it remains unclear whether ic694 occupies a narrow phase of galaxy evolution or whether the relationship between megamaser species and galactic processes is more complicated than previously believed . in this paper , we present results of a systematic search for 22 ghz water maser emission among oh megamaser hosts to identify additional objects hosting both megamaser . </S>",
    "<S> our work roughly doubles the number of galaxies searched for emission in both molecules which host at least one confirmed maser . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm with high degree of confidence ( @xmath0 ) the detection of water emission toward iizw96 , firmly establishing it as the second object to co - host both water and hydroxyl megamasers after ic694 . </S>",
    "<S> we find high luminosity , narrow features in the water feature in iizw96 . </S>",
    "<S> all dual megamaser candidates appear in merging galaxy systems suggestive that megamaser coexistance may signal a brief phase along the merger sequence . </S>",
    "<S> a statistical analysis of the results of our observations provide possible evidence for an exclusion of h@xmath1o kilomasers among oh megamaser hosts . </S>"
