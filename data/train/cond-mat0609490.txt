    "the use of echoes is a standard technique in spin resonance experiments @xcite , where a large number of echo pulse sequences are used .",
    "echo sequences typically consist of a number of high - frequency pluses that induce controlled rotations on the precessing spin .",
    "the objective is to remove or reduce dephasing due to inhomogeneities in the external magnetic field which give a variation of the precession rate across the sample ( known as inhomogeneous broadening ) .",
    "since any two - level quantum system can be mapped on a spin-@xmath0 in a magnetic field , similar operations can be performed on any such system , including a qubit .",
    "for example , there are recent experiments on superconducting qubits @xcite ( were it is called charge echo , since the physical degree of freedom is two charge states of a superconducting grain ) and electron spins in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "common to the existing echo techniques is the restriction that in order to apply the proper sequence of control rotations one must know the direction of the magnetic field . in other words ,",
    "the sequences are able to remove dephasing due to inhomogeneities in the field amplitude , but not the field direction ( the randomness in the direction of the magnetic field is indeed negligible if a strong external field is applied ) .",
    "starting with the experiments @xcite that showed long spin coherence times of electrons in bulk gaas there has been interest in using electrons confined in quantum dots as qubits .",
    "it appears that the limiting decoherence factor in these systems is the hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "as long as no special preparation is made , the nuclear spin system will give rise to an effective random magnetic field seen by the electron .",
    "this field will be random both in strength and direction , and in the absence of an external strong permanent magnetic field the usual echo sequences can not be applied . because the response of the nuclear spin system is much slower than the precession of the electron spin we can in a certain approximation assume the nuclear field to be constant . motivated by this we will in this paper investigate the problem of finding an echo sequence that is applicable in the case of a constant effective field with an arbitrary and unknown magnitude and direction .",
    "the goal of this sequence is to return the spin to its starting position at the end of the sequence , independently of the magnetic field .",
    "consider a spin-@xmath0 particle precessing in a constant magnetic field .",
    "let @xmath1 be the unit vector along the precession axis and @xmath2 be the precession angular frequency .",
    "the rotation of the spin state during time @xmath3 is then given by the unitary operator    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the identity and pauli matrices , and @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 rotations about the coordinate axes are denoted @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest form of a spin echo is for the situation where the spin is precessing in a field with known direction , say along the @xmath12-axis , but with unknown magnitude .",
    "then @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while @xmath15 is arbitrary . the usual echo sequence then consists in waiting for the time @xmath3 , applying an @xmath16 rotation , waiting time @xmath3 and applying a final @xmath16 rotation .",
    "the success of the procedure is expressed by the fact that @xmath17 is the identity ( up to a global sign , which is unimportant ) , independently of @xmath18 . by symmetry ,",
    "the same is true if @xmath16 is replaced by a @xmath8 rotation around any axis in the @xmath19-plane ( perpendicular to the precession axis ) .",
    "in particular we have @xmath20 .",
    "we want to extend this to the case were @xmath1 is not known .",
    "that is , we want to find a sequence of control rotations @xmath21 such that    @xmath22    for any @xmath18 .",
    "we make the following assumptions : i ) the control pulses are effectively instantaneous , meaning they can be performed in a time much less than the precession period .",
    "ii ) the external magnetic field is unknown but constant , so that the precession operator @xmath18 does not change in time .",
    "note that we have written eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) as if the time @xmath3 between the pulses is fixed .",
    "different time intervals between the pulses are achieved by choosing some of the @xmath21 to be the identity .",
    "this is sufficient if all intervals are integer multiples of a smallest unit .",
    "intervals with irrational ratios will require a more general form than eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) . in this paper",
    "we only use equal intervals .",
    "as was explained above , if we know the direction @xmath1 of the external field we can create an echo by applying two @xmath8 pulses around any axis perpendicular to @xmath1 .",
    "the sequence @xmath23 can be used if @xmath24 , and similarly we may use @xmath25 if we know that @xmath26 . consider the longer sequence @xmath27 for which , using the general @xmath18 of eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , we get    @xmath28    we see that @xmath29 for either @xmath24 or @xmath26",
    ". this may seem like a small gain , but this sequence is the key to the full solution . let us construct the mapping    @xmath30    the idea is that @xmath31 , being composed of the arbitrary @xmath18 and the fixed control rotations , will be `` less arbitrary '' than the original @xmath18 . iterating this mapping",
    "we then construct the set @xmath32 , @xmath33 , ... of pulse sequences that will be better and better approximations to the identity . since @xmath34 contains @xmath35 four times",
    "the time needed for the sequence @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "that is , the length of the sequence grows exponentially in @xmath37 .",
    "this is of course unfortunate as the sequences quickly will become impractically long .",
    "however we will see below that for a large portion of the space of parameters determining @xmath18 , a few iterations @xmath37 are sufficient to reach a good approximation to the identity .",
    "the domain of `` bad '' parameters shrinks exponentially with the increase of @xmath37 .    to illustrate this we represent a rotation by the polar angle @xmath38 and azimuth angle @xmath39 of the rotation axis ( so that @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and the rotation angle @xmath15 .",
    "+   +    figure [ f1 ] shows the evolution of the parameters @xmath43 upon successive transformations given by eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) .",
    "the set of initial rotations fills this space uniformly , see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ( a ) .",
    "figures [ f1 ] ( b)-(f ) show the successive iterations @xmath44 - @xmath45 of these points , illustrating the convergence of the mapping .    from eq .",
    "( [ it ] ) we can write down explicit formulas for the parameters @xmath46 of @xmath47 in terms of @xmath48 ,    @xmath49 we see that @xmath50 , @xmath14 is a fixed point , and this represents the identity operator .",
    "the stability of the fixed point can be analyzed by expanding close to the fixed point in the independent small quantities @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we get    @xmath54 were the primed quantities refer to the transformed rotation @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath56 are small quantities , then @xmath57 are even smaller and the fixed point is locally stable .",
    "we studied numerically the convergence of the mapping @xmath31 for points that are not close to the fixed point .",
    "looking at figure [ f1 ] we see that although most points converge to the vicinity of the fixed point in a few iterations , there are some points that do not converge fast . to get a better understanding we do as follows .",
    "let us choose some initial rotation angle @xmath15 and for each point in the @xmath58 plane construct the sequence @xmath44 , @xmath59 , ... stopping when @xmath35 is within a specified distance from the identity ( we used the stopping criterion @xmath60 ) .",
    "+   +   +    figure [ f2 ] shows the @xmath58 plane for various @xmath15 , the shades of gray representing the number @xmath37 of iterations needed for convergence .",
    "we see that for small @xmath15 convergence is fast and the pattern is simple , but for larger initial @xmath15 the pattern of convergence time is quite complex , and that there exist `` hard '' points , i.e. initial rotations @xmath48 that need a large number @xmath37 if iterations to converge .    to estimate the fraction of initial rotations that need a certain number of iterations to converge to the fixed point we do the following .",
    "we start with an ensemble of random initial rotations @xmath18 characterized by a unit vector @xmath1 distributed uniformly on a sphere and by an angle @xmath15 distributed uniformly from in the inerval @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "we proceed with the iterations , eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , until @xmath60 is reached .",
    "the logarithm of the fraction @xmath62 of initial rotations @xmath18 that needs @xmath37 iterations to converge is shown in figure [ f5 ] as a function of n.     of the initial random set of rotations which did not reach the condition @xmath63 till the @xmath37-th iteration .",
    "[ f5],width=302 ]    we find that about 74% of the initial rotations will converge after applying the third iterate @xmath64 and about 91% do so after the iterate @xmath65 .",
    "observe that except for the first points , all points fall on a straight line which means that the fraction @xmath62 of `` difficult '' initial rotations decays exponentially with the number of iterations , @xmath66 if @xmath67 is the number of repetitions of @xmath18 in @xmath31 ( for the mapping ( [ t ] ) we have @xmath68 ) , the total time of the sequence @xmath35 is @xmath69 , where @xmath3 is the time between the pulses . the relation ( [ a ] )",
    "can then also be written as the fraction @xmath70 of the initial rotations which did not converge till time @xmath71 , @xmath72 the relations eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ t ] ) are established by running a simulation with the use of a specific convergence criterion , @xmath73 .",
    "changing the criterion affects the proportionality coefficients in these relations , but does not change the values of exponents @xmath74 and @xmath75 .     of initial rotations that do not converge in nine iterations , according to the criterion @xmath76 .",
    "[ f3],width=302 ]    let @xmath77 denote the set of initial rotations that do not converge in @xmath37 iterations .",
    "[ as an example , the domain @xmath78 of `` difficult '' initial rotations ( according to the criterion @xmath76 ) is presented in fig .",
    "the sequence of sets @xmath77 is such that each set is contained in the previuos one , @xmath79 , and the fraction of points @xmath62 in figure [ f5 ] is proportional to the difference in the volumes of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the set @xmath82 of `` infinitely hard '' points appears to be a fractal with fractal dimension @xmath83 according to the box - counting algorithm we used .",
    "we considered the possibility of constructing an echo pulse sequence that does not require applying a high permanent field to the system .",
    "the advantage of such a method is that between the pulses the dynamics of the system is not influenced by external perturbations . in the context of esr of a quantum dot",
    ", this method may help distinguishing between different effects of the hyperfine interaction : this interaction creates some random effective magnetic field acting on the electron spin , but may also lead to electron spin relaxation .",
    "the absence of the external permanent field in this problem is crucial , as its application definitely suppresses the spin relaxation part of the hyperfine interaction effects @xcite .",
    "we have provided a solution to the general echo problem in terms of a set of longer and longer pulse sequences that give successively better approximations to the identity operator .",
    "we have tested several longer sequences _ e.g _ @xmath84 . in all cases we found that the exponent @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) is independent of the particular mapping chosen .",
    "whether this represents some inherent property of the problem or only is the case for the limited class of mappings we have studied is not known .",
    "for example , we have not studied sequences with control pulses other than @xmath8 rotations about the coordinate axes .",
    "we have also not ruled out the possibility of a solution that will yield an ideal echo with the help of a finite number of control pulses .",
    "the idea of using iterated mappings to generate pulse sequences has been used in nmr applications @xcite but as far as we know this particular problem or the mapping we study was never discussed .",
    "the mapping we have used was also proposed in ref . in the context of dynamical decoupling of a qubit .",
