    "a question regarding an isoperimetric problem about simple polygons was asked by brass , moser and pach ( see problem 3 on p. 437 in @xcite ) .    for @xmath1 odd ,",
    "what is the maximum perimeter of a simple @xmath0-gon contained in a euclidean unit disk ?",
    "the authors of @xcite remarked that for @xmath0 even , the supremum of the perimeters is the trivial upper bound @xmath3 , as it can be approached by simple @xmath0-gons in which the vertices alternate between some small neighborhoods of two antipodal points of the disk . this argument can not be applied if @xmath0 is odd . in 2009 , audet , hansen and messine @xcite showed that for @xmath0 odd , the supremum is attained as the perimeter of an isosceles triangle inscribed in the disk , with an edge of multiplicity @xmath2 .",
    "the author of @xcite gave a shorter proof of the same statement , and proved that for hyperbolic disks of any radius , the supremum is attained as the perimeter of an @xmath0-gon of the same kind ; that is , that of an isosceles triangle with a multiple edge inscribed in the disk .",
    "he noted that for @xmath0 even and for any plane convex body @xmath4 in the euclidean plane @xmath5 or in the hyperbolic plane @xmath6 , the supremum of the perimeters of the simple @xmath0-gons contained in @xmath4 is the trivial bound @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the diameter of @xmath4 .",
