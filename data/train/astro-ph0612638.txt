    "for more than two decades astrophysicists have struggled to compute the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal produced by rotating stellar iron core collapse and the subsequent supernova evolution . besides the coalescence of black hole and neutron star binaries , core - collapse events are considered to be among the most promising sources of detectable gws .",
    "theoretical predictions of the core - collapse supernova gw signature are still hampered by three major problems : ( i ) the rotational configuration prior to gravitational collapse is still uncertain since multi - d evolutionary calculations of rotating massive stars have not yet been performed ; ( ii ) reliable waveform estimates require a general relativistic ( gr ) treatment , since both high densities and high velocities in combination with strong gravitational fields are encountered in this problem ; and ( iii ) an adequate treatment of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and the neutrino microphysics / radiative transfer is crucial for obtaining realistic collapse , bounce , and postbounce dynamics and waveforms .",
    "gw emission from core - collapse supernovae may arise from rotating collapse and bounce , postbounce neutrino - driven convection , anisotropic neutrino emission , nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities of the protoneutron star ( pns ) , or from the recently proposed pns core g - mode oscillations  @xcite .",
    "previous estimates of the gw signature of core - collapse supernovae have relied either on newtonian simulations  @xcite ( to some extent approximating gr effects  @xcite ) , or gr simulations with simplified analytic ( so - called hybrid ) eoss and no neutrino treatment  @xcite .",
    "depending on the rotation strength , the softness of the eos at subnuclear densities , and the inclusion of gr effects , the collapse dynamics and , accordingly , the gw signatures can differ significantly .    in previous studies ,",
    "at least three `` types '' of dynamics and resulting gw signatures of rotating collapse were identified : type  i dynamics is characterized by little influence of centrifugal effects during collapse and bounce .",
    "type  i models undergo core bounce governed by the stiffening of the nuclear eos at nuclear density and `` ring down '' quickly into postbounce equilibrium .",
    "their waveforms exhibit one pronounced large ( negative ) spike at bounce and then show a gradually damped ring - down wave signal at early postbounce times .",
    "type  ii models , on the other hand , are rotation dominated and undergo core bounce at densities below ( or slightly above ) nuclear matter density under the strong influence of centrifugal forces .",
    "their dynamics generally exhibits multiple harmonic - oscillator - like damped slow cycles of coherent bounce  re - expansion ",
    "collapse ( `` multiple bounces '' ) , which is reflected in the waveform by distinct signal peaks associated with every bounce .",
    "type  iii dynamics is characterized by fast collapse ( owing to very efficient electron capture for instance in accretion - induced collapse or large artificial initial pressure reduction in polytropic core - collapse models ) , extremely small masses of the homologously collapsing inner core , and low - amplitude gw emission .    in this article",
    "we present new results from gr simulations , focussing on the rotating collapse , bounce , and early postbounce phases . as a first stage",
    "we perform 2d ( axisymmetric ) and 3d calculations with polytropic initial models and a hybrid eos in order to compare results obtained in the conformally - flat approximation to gr ( cfc ; conformal - flatness condition  @xcite ) with results from full cauchy free evolutions in @xmath1 gr . the second stage encompasses the first ever multi - d simulations of rotating stellar iron core collapse in gr with presupernova models from stellar evolution calculations , a finite - temperature nuclear eos , and a simple , but effective treatment of electron capture and neutrino radiation effects during collapse . in this way",

    "the grids extend to a maximum outer diagonal radius of @xmath48 and the finest grid has a linear zone size of @xmath49 .      in the coconut code",
    "we employ the cfc approximation to gr introduced by isenberg  @xcite and first used in a pseudo - evolutionary context by wilson et al .",

    "the extrinsic curvature becomes a function of these variables and the shift is to leading order ( for matter - dominated spacetimes ) identical to the minimal distortion condition  @xcite .",

    "electron capture during collapse reduces @xmath68 ( i.e.  `` deleptonizes '' the collapsing core ) and consequently decreases the size of the homologously collapsing inner core that roughly has a @xmath73 dependence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the material of the inner core is in sonic contact and determines the dynamics and the gw signal at core bounce and in the early postbounce phases .",
    "hence , it is important to include deleptonization during collapse .",
    "since multi - d gr radiation - hydrodynamics calculations are still computationally infeasible , in the simulations using the shen eos we employ a recently proposed scheme  @xcite in which deleptonization is parametrized based on data from detailed 1d radiation - hydrodynamics calculations . for this",

    "in addition , we perform calculations with the `` rotating '' presupernova model e20a of  @xcite , which we map onto our computational grids under the assumption of constant rotation on cylindrical shells of constant coordinate radius .",
    "we point out that due to their 1d nature , none of the considered models are in rotational equilibrium .",
    "this should not limit the quality of our results , since the collapse proceeds slowly on a timescale of more than @xmath94 and , hence , the star has sufficient time for the adjustment to the appropriate angular stratifications for its rate of rotation  @xcite .",
    "initial curvature data in ccw are obtained via the newtonian metric approximation  @xcite and in coconut via the cfc adm equations .    in this study , we focus on the collapse of massive presupernova iron cores with at most moderate differential rotation and maximum precollapse rotation rates that lead to pnss that are likely spinning too fast to yield cold ns spin periods in agreement with observationally inferred injection periods of young pulsars into the @xmath95 diagram  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , and in agreement with previous results  @xcite , our calculations indicate a natural centrifugal barrier that limits the maximum value of @xmath105 that can be reached during core collapse when a microphysical eos and presupernova models from stellar evolution calculations are employed .    in , we present gravitational waveforms of models with varying initial degree of differential rotation @xmath82 and rotation rate @xmath83 .",
    "this figure demonstrates that largely independent of the initial rotational configuration in the parameter space considered here , the gw signal of core bounce in rotating collapse has a _ generic shape _ :",
    "a slow signal increase in the prebounce phase , a large negative amplitude at core bounce when the motion of the quasi - homologously collapsing inner core is reversed , followed by a ring - down .",
    "this is a clear type  i signature corresponding to a baryonic pressure - dominated bounce .",
    "all our microphysical models undergo core bounce dominated by the stiffening of the eos at nuclear density , and most of them radiate the largest fraction of their gw energy in a relatively narrow band ( with @xmath109 ) centered in the range between about @xmath110 and @xmath111 . with increasing influence of centrifugal effects ,",
    "the peaks of the gw energy spectra get shifted to lower frequencies , reaching @xmath112 for the axisymmetric emission in model s20a2b4 .",
    "the above is in stark contrast to the studies using the hybrid eos  @xcite ( see also ) , where several initial models with rotation rates in the range investigated here develop sufficient centrifugal support during contraction to stop the collapse at subnuclear densities , resulting in several consecutive centrifugal bounces separated by phases of coherent re - expansion of the inner core . while in gr such models exhibiting a multiple centrifugal bounce and the corresponding type  ii gw signals are only rarer compared to newtonian gravity  @xcite if a hybrid eos is used ( which is identical to a polytrope before bounce ) , we do not observe _ any _ such model in our microphysical models .",
    "an evident example is model s20a2b4 : in previous studies without microphysics , the corresponding model with identical initial rotation parameters and a subnuclear @xmath89 close to 4/3 like a2b4g1 with @xmath113 ( or a2b4g2 with @xmath114 not presented here ) showed clear type  ii behavior in both newtonian and gr calculations  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the multiple centrifugal bounce scenario is due to two physical effects : on the one hand , gr results in a stronger gravitational pull as compared to a purely newtonian treatment , thus forming a smaller , more compact pns with higher maximum density",
    ". this _ effectively stronger gravity _ in gr severely limits the region in rotational parameter space which permits multiple centrifugal bounces  @xcite . additionally , and even more importantly , in contrast to the simple hybrid eos , in our case the mass and dynamics of the inner core ( which is most important for the gw emission ) is not merely determined by the adiabatic index @xmath115 ( at constant entropy ) of the eos , but also by deleptonization during collapse .",
    "this leads to _ considerably smaller inner cores _ with less angular momentum and weaker pressure support  @xcite , which again suppresses multiple centrifugal bounces in a very efficacious way . however , even when including the effects of deleptonization , the mass of the inner core is still substantially larger than when a hybrid eos with @xmath116 at subnuclear densities is used",
    ". this explains why we do not observe any type  iii waveforms in the microphysical models , as these require an extremely small mass of the inner core  @xcite .",
    "an instructive example for the impact of deleptonization and gr on the collapse dynamics is the type  ii model  d from the newtonian study of mnchmeyer & mller  @xcite , where a microphysical finite - temperature eos and an approximate deleptonization scheme were employed ( including only electron capture on protons and neglecting captures on heavy nuclei which leads to larger @xmath68 and inner core masses at core bounce than observed in our models ) .",
    "when abandoning the restrictions of the deleptonization scheme or gravity in that work by using a more modern prescription for electron capture  @xcite or including gr effects ( and certainly by combining both ) , we now find that their model  d exhibits unambigous pressure - dominated collapse dynamics with a type  i gw signal .",
    "a detailed analysis of the interplay and quantitative influence of the above two effects responsible for the elimination of multiple centrifugal bounces in the rotating stellar core - collapse scenario is discussed in  @xcite and will be presented in a future publication  @xcite .      in recent studies dynamical rotational instabilities of @xmath117 and/or @xmath118 character where found in equilibrium polytropic stellar models ( in newtonian gravity and gr ; see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) and in simplified postbounce pns models  @xcite at low @xmath105 in the range of @xmath119 .",
    "in contrast to the classical high-@xmath108 instability , this new kind of dynamical instability appears to be related to resonant amplification of azimuthal fluid modes at corotation points , where the pattern speed of the mode @xmath120 ( where @xmath121 is the mode frequency ) , coincides with the local angular velocity  @xcite .",
    "+ [ 1em ]    in the light of the previous results on low-@xmath108 corotation instabilities , we continue the postbounce evolution of models e20a and s20a2b4 in order to investigate the development of nonaxisymmetric structure in the pns and postshock regions of our physically more realistic models .",
    "models e20a and s20a2b4 are both relatively quickly spinning and bracket a range of postbounce @xmath105s of @xmath122 .",
    "we perform an analysis of azimuthal density modes @xmath123 in the equatorial plane by computing the complex fourier amplitudes @xmath124 on rings of constant coordinate radius . in the top panels of we display the normalized mode amplitudes @xmath125 extracted in the two models at @xmath126 radius . without adding artificial seed perturbations to our calculations , discretization errors and the finite accuracy of the newton ",
    "raphson scheme employed in the eos routines trigger @xmath127 modes , which rise to a level of @xmath128 during the collapse phases lasting @xmath129 and @xmath130 in models s20a2b4 and e20a , respectively .    in both models",
    ", the @xmath118 mode grows fastest and with a dynamical rate at core bounce , and surpasses the ambient cartesian @xmath131 grid mode at @xmath132 after bounce , reaching maximum normalized amplitudes of up to @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134 modes grow as well , but at a lower rate , and reach smaller amplitudes than the @xmath118 mode .",
    "note that both models remain dynamically stable to the @xmath131 grid mode .",
    "in the lower half of the two panels of we plot the gw strains @xmath135 and @xmath136 as seen by an observer located on the polar axis at @xmath137 distance .",
    "the rotational symmetry prevailing at bounce and early postbounce times is apparent from the fact that @xmath135 as well as @xmath136 at the pole are essentially zero until the models develop considerable nonaxisymmetry at @xmath138 ( in e20a ) and @xmath139 ( in s20a2b4 ) after bounce .",
    "the gw emission along the polar axis is entirely due to the quadrupole components of the nonaxisymmetric dynamics and , hence , the time at which the gw signals become strong is correlated with the evolution of the @xmath117 mode amplitude .",
    "this fact is most clearly portrayed by model s20a2b4 whose gw emission sets in at the time when the @xmath117 mode amplitude crosses that of the background @xmath131 mode .",
    "the gw emission is in a very narrow frequency band ( with @xmath140 ) .",
    "the energy spectra peak at @xmath141 for model e20a and at @xmath142 for model s20a2b4 .",
    "in remarkable agreement with expectations for a simple spinning - bar model , @xmath135 and @xmath136 in both models oscillate at the same frequency and are phase - shifted by a quarter cycle .    by analyzing the nonaxisymmetric mode structure in both models we find ( i ) that the pattern speeds of the @xmath134 modes agree with that of the @xmath118 mode , indicating non - linear mode coupling and ( ii ) that the gw emission occurs at a frequency corresponding to twice the pattern speed of the @xmath118 mode . in",
    ", we compare the @xmath118 pattern speed with equatorial angular velocity profiles in model e20a .",
    "the @xmath118 mode is in corotation with the fluid throughout the postbounce phase at the edge of the pns core at @xmath143 , where the shear energy stored in differential rotation is large .",
    "this is evidence for the corotation low-@xmath108 nature of the rotational instability observed here  @xcite .",
    "the study presented in this article relies on @xmath1 full gr and @xmath0 cfc - gr calculations of the collapse of rapidly rotating stellar iron cores to pnss .",
    "the @xmath1 calculations are the first of their kind that are carried out in fully self - consistent fashion on mesh - refined cartesian grids .",
    "our calculations are the first ever multi - d calculations of core collapse in gr that include a finite - temperature nuclear eos , presupernova models from stellar evolutionary studies , deleptonization during collapse , and neutrino pressure effects .    by comparing results from fully gr and cfc collapse calculations",
    "we observe no significant deviations that could be attributed to systematic deficiencies of the cfc approximation in the stellar iron core collapse context . by means of the cotton ",
    "york tensor ( which vanishes on conformally - flat spacelike slices ) we find that the prebounce and early postbounce spacetimes do not deviate from conformal flatness by more than a few percent .",
    "the cfc approximation employed in coconut is , hence , an excellent choice for the modeling of rotating core collapse . in addition , we point out that the capability of coconut to perform the evolution in spherical coordinates combined with its high computational efficiency in axisymmetry makes it particularly well suited for studying matter - dominated spacetimes in rotational symmetry .",
    "our results show that the gw signature of the collapse , core bounce , and early postbounce phases of the core - collapse supernova evolution is much more generic than previously thought .",
    "we find that the dynamics of core bounce is dominated by gravity and microphysics , reducing the relevance of centrifugal support for the wide range of initial rotation rates and degrees of differential rotation considered here .",
    "importantly , for our model set we do not observe rotationally - induced multiple core bounces as proposed by previous studies that did not include a microphysical finite - temperature nuclear eos and a deleptonization treatment in combination with gr .",
    "all models stay axisymmetric throughout collapse , bounce , and the very early postbounce phase , and none of them reach the limit in @xmath144 for the classical dynamical maclaurin - type rotational instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent study and references therein ) .",
    "however , models s20a2b4 and e20a , which we evolve to later postbounce times , exhibit the dynamical growth of a nonaxisymmetric low-@xmath108 corotation - type @xmath118 instability  @xcite .",
    "we also observe @xmath134 daughter modes that apparently grow to significant amplitudes via non - linear mode coupling .",
    "strong gws are emitted by the quadrupole components of the nonaxisymmetric dynamics . while we carried out long - term postbounce evolutions only for models s20a2b4 and e20a , we point out that other models with similar postbounce pns structures and rotational configurations are likely to experience the same kind of instability .",
    "our results , which remove the limitations of previous studies , demonstrate that the development of nonaxisymmetric structures is neither limited to newtonian gravity , simple matter models , equilibrium configurations , nor high values of @xmath105 above the classical instability thresholds , but may rather be a phenomenon occurring generically in differentially rotating compact stars .    for an assessment of the detectability of the gw emissions from our models by initial and advanced ligo detectors , we consider the characteristic gw strain spectra @xmath145 @xcite and compare them to the optimal ligo rms noise curves  @xcite in .",
    "considering only the axisymmetric gw burst from core bounce , @xmath146 reaches values up to @xmath147 and has its maximum between 300 and 800  hz . the gw emission from the nonaxisymmetric dynamics tracked in models e20a and s20a2b4 occurs at lower gw amplitudes than that from core bounce , but over a prolonged period of many tens of milliseconds and in almost monotone fashion centered around @xmath148 . in total",
    "emitted energy and in @xmath146 the gw emission from the nonaxisymmetric instability dwarfs that associated with the axisymmetric core bounce and greatly enhances the gw detectability of these models .",
    "importantly , we point out that at the end of our simulations the nonaxisymmetric dynamics in models e20a and s20a2b4 show no sign of decay .",
    "they could potentially continue for hundreds of milliseconds until the supernova explosion puts an end to the infusion of high angular momentum material through the stalled shock and sufficient angular momentum is redistributed by the instability to break corotation .",
    "based on we conclude that the gw signal from axisymmetric core bounce of all models investigated here is likely to be detectable by current and future ligo - class detectors from anywhere in the milky way .",
    "models that become nonaxisymmetrically unstable may be detectable out to much larger distances if the instability persists for a sufficiently long time .",
    "we point out that owing to the nature of the approximate deleptonization treatment employed in this study we are unable to capture postbounce neutrino effects and can not track the sudden drop in electron fraction inside the pns core associated with the neutrino burst at shock breakout a few milliseconds after bounce .",
    "hence , our treatment of the late - time postbounce evolution is of limited quality , but will be improved in future work .",
