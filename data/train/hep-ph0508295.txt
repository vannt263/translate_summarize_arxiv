    "one of the important unsolved problems in obtaining bound - state solutions in quantum field theories such as quantum chromodynamcs is how to implement ultraviolet renormalization nonperturbatively .",
    "the central difficulty is that any truncation or approximation of the theory which breaks lorentz symmetries , such as the truncation of the fock space , introduces spurious divergences .",
    "quadratic divergences can occur in the approximated theory , even when the renormalizable perturbative feynman theory has only logarithmic divergences .",
    "such problems arise even when one uses light - front quantization methods which retain the maximal set of kinematical lorentz symmetries .",
    "a systematic light - front approach to renormalization , developed by glazek , harindranath , perry , and wilson  @xcite , is to introduce new effective interactions which act as counterterms to control the ultraviolet behavior of the approximated theory .",
    "however , this method is challenging to implement in practice , because the large set of new effective interactions , some of which have a nonlocal structure , can require so much input data that the ability to make predictions is seriously compromised .",
    "another important nonperturbative approach is to cast the bound - state problem in the form of an effective bethe ",
    "salpeter equation and use schwinger  dyson methods to construct the effective renormalized quark and gluon propagators of the theory , including running quark masses consistent with chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite . in principle , this method could be used to predict the light - front wave functions needed for qcd phenomenology , if one evaluates the minkowski - space bethe ",
    "salpeter wave functions at fixed light - front time .",
    "however , it has been difficult to carry out this program in practice since the analyses have only been done in ladder gluon - exchange approximation and in euclidean space .",
    "the full structure of nonperturbative renormalization will require consideration of higher - order kernels .",
    "lattice gauge theory  @xcite is currently the most successful method for solving gauge theories ; it has a systematic gauge - invariant regularization procedure despite the fact that nonlinear gauge interactions are introduced and the lattice structure itself violates lorentz symmetries at finite lattice size .",
    "however , unlike light - front methods , wave function information for bound states and other physical features of hadron dynamics have to be obtained indirectly through moments , because the lattice theory is formulated in euclidean space .    in our work",
    "@xcite on light - front quantization , we have shown that the technique of pauli  villars ( pv ) regularization  @xcite of ultraviolet divergences can be implemented in nonperturbative light - front calculations of field - theoretic bound states . until now this",
    "has been limited to light - front fock - space truncations where the resulting wave functions could be computed analytically  @xcite or to numerical calculations using discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite with limited precision  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will test the pv method in some detail and present accurate results for the dressed - fermion state in yukawa theory with a fock basis which includes three - particle states .    in order to perform our calculations using pv regularization",
    ", we first introduce a sufficient number of pv fields in the underlying lagrangian in order to render perturbation theory finite .",
    "however , we must also make sure that our nonperturbative result , if expanded in a power series in the coupling constant , would give agreement with the usual feynman series for processes that can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "obtaining such assurance may require the introduction of additional pv fields or counterterms , or both .",
    "paston and franke  @xcite have given a general set of rules which determine exactly what combination of pv fields and counterterms are needed to assure perturbative equivalence with feynman methods . in that paper they apply their methods to the case of yukawa theory ; in @xcite , paston , franke and prokhvatilov apply the methods to give the same information for qcd . in the case of the yukawa theory that we study here ,",
    "one pv fermion and one pv boson are sufficient to assure perturbative equivalence with feynman methods without the need for counterterms .",
    "the pv regulators always preserve lorentz invariance and may preserve gauge invariance , or at least the ward identity . in the theories studied to date ,",
    "the pv fields alone have been sufficient to give a finite theory , perturbatively equivalent to feynman theory , without breaking lorentz or gauge invariance ; in future work we expect to include counterterms , along with the pv fields , in order to restore symmetries broken by the pv fields .",
    "we must truncate the fock space in order to be able to perform a numerical calculation of the spectrum and the wave functions .",
    "so far , all of our calculations have been for the ground state .",
    "the truncation breaks the symmetries of the theory , but since this introduces only finite breaking , we argue that if our answer is close , numerically , to the answer without truncation , then the approximated result should yield a useful result .",
    "this was shown to be the case in a nonperturbative calculation of the electron s magnetic moment in qed  @xcite .",
    "we will work with the theory in light - cone coordinates  @xcite , in order to have a well defined fock expansion and a simple vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the field - theoretic bound - state problem for the dressed fermion is then reduced to integral equations for the wave functions which appear in the fock expansion .",
    "the expansion is truncated to include states in three sectors : the bare fermion , the one - boson  one - fermion states , and the two - boson  one - fermion states .",
    "we neglect fermion - pair contributions .    in yukawa theory and in qed , both without fermion loops , it is adequate to include one pv fermion and one pv boson to regulate the ultraviolet divergences . at the end of the calculation , we wish to take the pv masses large , and there is an ambiguity as to how to do that .",
    "we can take the fermion pv mass much larger than the pv boson mass , take the pv masses to be about equal , or take the pv boson mass to be much larger than the pv fermion mass .",
    "the answer that one obtains depends on the choice of this mass ratio  @xcite . in the case of qed , restoration of gauge invariance requires that the pv fermion mass be taken to infinity while the pv boson mass remains finite  @xcite .",
    "( although both types of pv particles must be included to render the theory finite , once the calculations are complete the limit of the pv fermion mass going to infinity exists . )",
    "of course , since the limit of the pv fermion mass going to infinity is finite , taking the fermion mass sufficiently large but finite will be adequate .",
    "we believe that taking the fermion mass to infinity first is the physical limit in yukawa theory as well , but we have no argument as strong as the one in the case of qed ; in the present paper we shall show results for taking the pv fermion mass large first and also for keeping the pv masses equal . due to the truncation of the representation space , there always remain uncancelled divergences , so at least one pv mass must remain finite .    unlike qed , where the wave function and vertex renormalizations cancel , yukawa theory has a logarithmically divergent charge renormalization even without considering fermion loops and vacuum polarization .",
    "thus in our truncation we must consider renormalization of both charge and fermion mass . to handle these renormalizations",
    "nonperturbatively , we regulate the theory and then fix the bare coupling and bare fermion mass by imposing conditions on the mass and dirac radius of the dressed - fermion eigenstate .",
    "there are three objectives for the present work : one is associated with the need to take the limit of the pv fermion mass to infinity first , leaving the theory regulated by just the pv boson mass . while the answer for infinite pv fermion mass exists , an explicit solution is not known , and for now we must settle for taking the fermion mass very large compared with the pv boson mass .",
    "that choice of masses raises a strong possibility of numerical trouble .",
    "numerical methods work best in problems with a single scale , but here we have three scales : the physical mass scale , the pv boson mass scale , and the pv fermion mass scale . in this paper we present techniques which allow us to make accurate calculations even when the three mass scales are very different .",
    "a further objective of the present work is associated with the need to keep one pv mass , usually the pv boson mass , finite , and therefore the need to choose a value for it . in",
    "@xcite we proposed a method for choosing the pv boson mass based on the idea that there are two types of error associated with a finite pv mass , and that we should choose a value for which neither type of error is too large .",
    "( if no such value exists then our method will not work . )",
    "two elements of the proposed method of choosing a final pv mass are examined in the present paper .",
    "one proposal is that one can obtain a reasonable estimate of the weight of the true wave function on the lowest excluded fock sector by performing a perturbation calculation using the calculated wave function as the unperturbed state .",
    "the other proposal is that the weight of the wave function on the first excluded sector provides a useful estimate of the percent by which physical parameters would shift if the first excluded sector were to be included .",
    "we use the results of a calculation including only up to two particles to perform a perturbative estimate of the weight of the true wave function on the three - particle states and then compare that result with the weight of the wave function in the three - particle sector when that sector is included in the calculation .",
    "we also calculate a number of physical quantities for both the two - particle truncation and the three - particle truncation and compare the percent by which they change with the percent of the wave function that is in the three - particle sector .",
    "the final objective of the present work is just to study the effects of adding an additional sector to the calculation .",
    "this extends earlier work  @xcite where a truncation to two particles allowed analytic solutions .",
    "we can see whether properties of the solutions persist with inclusion of the three - particle sectors and whether new physics appears .",
    "the pv fermion and pv boson are introduced to the theory in such a way that the interaction term in the modified lagrangian is a coupling between zero - norm combinations of the physical and pv fields .",
    "this guarantees that instantaneous - fermion terms do not appear in the light - cone hamiltonian and only ordinary three - particle vertices remain .",
    "the negative - metric particles also cancel infinities from integrals over transverse momenta .",
    "the numerical approximation is then applied to a finite theory at fixed pv masses , and the behavior of the solution is studied as the pv masses are increased .",
    "the structure of the problem is simpler than in the case of quantum electrodynamics  @xcite , not only because the bosons are massive scalars but also because the kernels of the integral operators are not plagued by singularities caused by spurious thresholds . here",
    "the bare fermion mass is driven to large values rather than the small values seen in qed ; this prevents the singularities .",
    "the solution to the eigenvalue problem for the dressed - fermion state is obtained by first rearranging the coupled set of integral equations for the mass eigenvalue problem into a set of effective equations for the one - boson  one - fermion wave functions .",
    "the kernels of these equations have contributions from intermediate states containing a single bare fermion and states containing two bosons and a fermion , including self - energy terms .",
    "the effective equations can be considered an eigenvalue problem for the bare coupling at fixed bare and dressed fermion masses .",
    "the numerical solution provides the wave functions as well as the bare coupling .",
    "we can use these to compute various properties of the dressed fermion , including the magnetic moment and axial coupling , as well as structure functions .",
    "the traditional dlcq method  @xcite has limited accuracy in the present case , because the solution is sensitive to regions of small longitudinal light - cone momentum fractions , on the order of the reciprocal of the pv mass squared in units of the physical mass .",
    "the equal spacings in momentum used in dlcq must then be so large in number as to be impractical .",
    "here we use coordinate transformations and gauss  legendre quadrature to capture these important regions .    the calculation of the solution",
    "is simplified by working in transverse polar coordinates .",
    "the fock expansion is constructed to be an explicit eigenstate of @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of the wave functions on the azimuthal angle can then be determined exactly and removed from the numerical calculation .",
    "this reduces the effective dimension of the numerical problem from three to two .",
    "the notation that we use for light - cone coordinates is @xmath3 the time coordinate is @xmath4 , and the dot product of two four - vectors is @xmath5 the light - cone momentum component conjugate to @xmath6 is @xmath7 , and the light - cone energy is @xmath8 .",
