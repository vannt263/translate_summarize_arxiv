    "superconducting quantum bits  @xcite have recently achieved a breakthrough by demonstrating excellent gate fidelities and long coherence times in a fully scalable architecture  @xcite , placing the realization of an integrated quantum computing chip within reach .",
    "the solid - state approach however bears the burden that the material of the quantum device itself may host parasitic defects that give rise to two - level systems ( tls ) acting as a sparse decohering bath .",
    "first signatures of coherent tls in phase qubits were found in spectroscopy data , where observed avoided level crossings manifest the defects two - level quantum character  @xcite . often , these defects show longer coherence times than the qubit itself  @xcite and thus might be useful as quantum memories  @xcite and resources for quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "phase qubits were employed in several attempts to identify the physical origin of those tls , for example by obtaining statistics on frequencies and coupling strengths  @xcite , estimating their density  @xcite , measuring the temperature dependence of their coherence times  @xcite , or verifying theoretical models describing their origin  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a direct interaction between tls has been invoked in the past to explain the line width broadening and spectral diffusion of ultrasonically excited ensembles of tls in glasses  @xcite as well as various other low - temperature properties of disordered solids@xcite .",
    "tls are furthermore a widely accepted model to explain noise in superconducting circuits , and mutual tls coupling was recently suggested as the origin of the low frequency noise observed in microwave resonators  @xcite .",

    "interpretation of the measurement based on atomic tunneling systems fully accounts for all observations .",
    "to explain the microscopic origin of the tls in superconducting electronics , several models@xcite have been proposed .",
    "however , all experimental results obtained so far , including the recent demonstration that the energy of the tls is tunable by static mechanical strain@xcite , are readily explained assuming that they originate from atomic tunneling systems .",
    "as in the well studied model describing the low temperature thermal , dielectric , and acoustic properties of disordered solids@xcite , it is assumed that some atoms or small groups of atoms are able to tunnel between two energetically almost equivalent sites within the disordered oxide material of the device .",
    "these systems give rise to two - level excitations in a wide energy range of up to the order @xmath41k or @xmath5 ghz . in bulk disordered solids , tls are found in large numbers but , in contrast to their counterparts present in superconducting qubits , can not be addressed individually .    according to the tunneling model ,",

    "the energies of the two wells differ by the asymmetry @xmath1 and the tunneling amplitude between them is denoted as @xmath6 , resulting in a level splitting of the two eigenstates given by @xmath7.tunneling systems couple to the environment predominantly by variation @xmath8 of their asymmetry energy with @xmath8 depending linearly on strain fields and , if the tunneling entity moves a non - zero charge , as well on electric field  the latter serving as an apparent explanation for the observed coupling of the tls to the qubit circuit .",
    "a variation @xmath9 of the tunneling amplitude induced by strain or external fields is generally believed to be negligible@xcite .",

[ fig : figure1]c .",
    "the qubit s level splitting and their population are controlled by externally applied flux bias and resonant microwave pulses , respectively , and a dc - squid is used for qubit readout .    in order to trace the energies of individual tls while applying strain to the qubit chip , we use a spectroscopy scheme based on the pulse protocol depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]a .",
    "the qubit is first biased at a frequency far away from the intended spectroscopy region and excited by a resonant microwave @xmath11-pulse . applying appropriate flux bias ,",
    "it is then tuned to the probing frequency @xmath12 where it resides for the holding time @xmath13 .",
    "if at this frequency the qubit is in resonance with a certain tls , the excitation is shared between the systems@xcite .",

    "dark traces indicate the resonance frequencies of individual tls , which are tuned by strain as expected for atomic tunneling systems .",
    "some tls have a tunneling energy @xmath19 that falls within the frequency range accessible by the qubit ( about 6.5 - 10 ghz for our sample ) , while also their asymmetry energy @xmath1 is tuned through zero in the investigated strain range .",
    "accordingly , for those tls we can clearly observe the hyperbolic strain - dependence of their resonance frequencies around minima given by @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the distribution of tls resonances changes completely once the sample is warmed to room temperature , see supplementary figure 1 for various examples .",
    "this can be explained by a modification of the atomic configuration changing the tls environment locally , and also by an offset in the applied strain due to thermal dilatation of the sample fixture .",
    "as long as the temperature is kept below about 10 - 20 k , the properties of the majority of tls remain constant over several months of measurements .    for tls that are strongly coupled to the qubit , the chosen interaction time @xmath13 may exceed the duration of one swap operation .",
    "since the latter also depends on the detuning , a fringe - like interference pattern occurs around the traces , see supplementary figure 2 .",
    "more details on this effect and other artefacts in such defect spectra are discussed in supplementary note 1 .",
    "in the defect spectroscopy example shown in fig .  [ fig : figure2]d , two different effects of interactions between tls can be identified : i ) the resonance frequency of certain tls is observed to switch between two values in a random , telegraph - signal like fashion , with a switching frequency that depends on the applied strain .",
    "this effect is explained by assuming that the observed tls couples non - resonantly to an incoherent defect which fluctuates between its positions .",
    "ii ) much less frequently observed are non - hyperbolic strain responses in the tls resonance frequency as well as level splittings that are the typical signature of two resonantly coupled coherent quantum systems .    in the remainder of this article",
    ", we discuss a particularly clear manifestation of a system of two coupled tls , whose defect spectroscopy signature revealed the _ s_shaped trace with avoided level crossings shown in fig .",

    "also inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ) . qualitatively speaking , we observe that tls1 couples only weakly to the applied external strain so that the step - like increase of its resonance frequency is almost exclusively due to its non - resonant coupling to tls2 . in the region",
    "shown , the double - well potential of tls2 is strain - tuned through its symmetry point @xmath21 at @xmath22 such that the probability density of its ground state is shifted gradually from one potential well to the other .",
    "the accompanied shift in atomic positions is mediated via internal strain or electric field to tls1 , which responds by modifying its energy splitting , here from 6 to 6.8 ghz . eventually , the applied strain tunes tls2 into resonance with tls1 and their coherent interaction gives rise to the associated and observed level repulsions .     * exploring the energy level structure for the coupled defect system . * * a * level scheme of the resonantly coupled defect system for an applied strain near the right avoided level crossing of fig .",

    "* was obtained in the experimental run in which we characterized the coupled defect system as discussed in the main text .",
    "about one year later , the same sample revealed a similar system of two coupled defects shown in the red box in  [ fig : spectra]*b * , having comparable longitudinal coupling strength but different resonance frequencies and opposite symmetry .",
    "it may well be that both observations involve the same tunneling systems which however experience slightly different local potential configurations .",
    "in supplementary figure  [ fig : spectra]*b * , one can notice that the frequency of the coupled defect system switched while the spectrum was measured around a voltage of about -25 v ( the dashed red arrow indicates the shift in frequency ) .",
    "such spontaneous changes in the resonance frequencies of some tls are observed frequently and occur most often shortly after the sample was cooled to milikelvin temperatures .",
    "this is readily explained by a coupling of the observed coherent tls to incoherent tls , also called `` two - level fluctuators '' , which may be of same physical origin but have a small rate of tunneling between their potential wells .",
    "if such a fluctuator is strongly asymmetric , it may be found in its higher energy state soon after the cool - down while it would remain in its ground state once tunneling occurred .",
    "experimentally , we found that the number of spontaneously switching tls is reduced by repeatedly cycling the applied strain through the complete range , hereby `` annealing '' the sample in the sense that fluctuators are stimulated to tunnel to their more stable ground state .",

    "2  d * of the main text has been measured in the same cool - down as [ fig : spectra ]  * b * , but 3 weeks later .",

    "fringes or shadow - like replica of some tls traces , such as shown in supplementary figure  [ fig : fringes]*a * , may appear for tls whose coupling strength to the qubit exceeds @xmath72 . in this case , the chosen interaction time @xmath13 exceeds the duration of one swap operation such that the excitation is transferred back to the qubit , and this lowers the defect signal @xmath14 ( see also fig .",
    "2b in main article ) .",
    "since the frequency of swap oscillations increases with the detuning between qubit and tls , a minimal qubit population ( maximal signal @xmath73 ) thus occurs only in the vicinity of the exact resonance as shown in supplementary figures  [ fig : fringes]*b * and * c*.    fringes may also occur due to residual entanglement between the qubit and tls .",

    "accordingly , the @xmath11-pulse prepares some entangled state between the systems , whose phase is then modified in dependence of the subsequent qubit detuning during the interaction time  @xmath13 .",
    "qubit drift due to uncontrolled slow changes in its bias flux leads to deviations in the defect signal s frequency dependence . for supplementary figure  [ fig : spectra]*c * , in total about 140,000 data points were measured , of which each was averaged 1000 times at a repetition rate of about 500 hz , resulting in a total measurement duration of @xmath75 3.5 days .",
    "an example of qubit drift can be seen in supplementary figure  [ fig : spectra]*c * around a piezo voltage of about 7 v , which was measured while feeding liquid helium to the dilution refrigerator .",
    "this resulted in a small change of the qubit flux bias because of temperature variations in its bias line filters that are installed at the 1k - pot of the cryostat .",
    "qubit drift can be distinguished from tls resonance frequency fluctuations since all tls signals are shifted equally .",
    "we note that the measurement time could be easily reduced by at least one order of magnitude if one employs a dispersive qubit readout method  @xcite instead of the dc - squid switching - current measurements employed here  @xcite .",
    "assuming the tlss interact with their environment via their electric dipole moment with the qubit circuit , the corresponding coupling operator is @xmath76 , whose expectation values identify the position of the particle .",
    "the interaction of an individual tls with the electric fields inside the qubit s junction is then described as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the electric dipole interaction strength and we used the fact that for a phase qubit in its eigenbasis , the electric field operator is @xmath79  @xcite . rewriting supplementary eq .",
    "( [ eq : hiq ] ) in the tls eigenbasis , we retain two terms , of which the transversal coupling term @xmath80 with @xmath81 describes the resonant interaction between the jj qubit and the tls @xmath82 .",
    "it is this term in particular which causes the exchange of excitations between the two systems .",
    "we obtained the electric coupling strength between qubit and tls1 , @xmath83 , by fitting time - domain oscillations of the initially excited qubit tuned into resonance with tls1 , far away from the tls1-tls2 anti - crossing , where @xmath83 is independent of the state of tls2 .",
    "we performed the same experiment also with both , lower and upper branches , in the vicinity of the tls1-tls2 anti - crossing ( the pulse sequence is shown on the inset in supplementary figure  [ fig : figure4_app ] ) .",
    "the result is plotted in supplementary figure  [ fig : figure4_app]*a * , green for the lower and red for the upper branch .",
    "the panels in supplementary figure  [ fig : figure4_app]b and c show the observed oscillations in the qubit population .",
    "since tls2 is very weakly coupled to the qubit , the oscillation frequency decreases quickly with voltage when following a branch turning into tls2 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the crossing point of the two curves is not at the voltage of 7 v where tls1 and tls2 are in exact resonance .",
    "this would be expected if the qubit - tls2 coupling was zero , as indicated by the dashed curves .",
    "a non - zero @xmath84 explains this shift , because the coupling between the qubit and the @xmath85 states scales as @xmath86 .",
    "then , the theory shows a very good agreement with the experiment and we obtain @xmath87 mhz and @xmath88 mhz at an applied strain where the tls are in resonance @xmath89 .    with the already known @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 mhz and @xmath93 mhz can be calculated from supplementary equation  ( [ eq : ham_full_param ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the very small @xmath84 is not attributed to a smaller dipole moment in direction of the qubit electric field , but can be simply explained by a strong asymmetry @xmath94 resulting in a very small dipole moment of the tls eigenstates .",
    "this analysis is restricted to the assumption that both tlss interact purely electrically .",
    "we write the full hamiltonian describing the jj - qubit coupled to two interacting tlss as @xmath95 with the qubit hamiltonian @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the level - splitting of the two lowest qubit states and @xmath98 is a pauli - matrix describing the qubit eigenstates .",
    "@xmath99 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath100 tls , while @xmath101 describes its interaction with the qubit , and @xmath102 the tlss mutual interaction as described in the main manuscript .",
    "diagonalizing the hamiltonian in supplementary eq .",
    "( [ eq : hfullsupp ] ) introduces several new terms .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian , @xmath103 , can be significantly simplified by ignoring all coupling terms of the form @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "they represent a coupling where one partner changes its state depending on the instantaneous state of the other subsystem and contribute only as small energy offsets . neglecting these minor energy shifts ,",
    "we can write the significant parts of the full hamiltonian as @xmath106 with @xmath107 here the relationship between the longitudinal and transversal coupling factors @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which are easily identifiable in experiment , and the tls mixing angles @xmath110 becomes clear . in our case , the @xmath64 dependence of @xmath25 can not be observed because when tls2 is detuned from tls1 , the perpendicular coupling @xmath111 becomes irrelevant we can interpret the term @xmath112 as representing the expectation value of the position operator in the double - well potential @xmath113 , so that @xmath114 . as explained in the main manuscript ,",
    "when tuning through the tls2 symmetry point , @xmath115 changes its sign , corresponding to reversing the direction of tls2 s dipole moment . due to the strong dipole - dipole interaction , tls1 adjusts its energy splitting accordingly , and",
    "this results in the observed _",
    "s_-shaped signature .",
    "additionally , the angles @xmath64 also change the qubit - tls coupling strength @xmath116 which determines the visibility of tls in our defect spectroscopy .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath116 is maximal when the tls is at its symmetry point @xmath117 , and it is strongly suppressed for largely asymmetric tlss with @xmath118 .",
    "these considerations allow us to obtain a close fit of the theoretical model to the experimental data , with the results displayed in supplementary figure  [ fig : figure3_app ] and table  i , respectively .    during our measurements ,",
    "we occasionally observe abrupt jumps of individual tls resonance frequencies on a time - scale of days or weeks . from defect spectroscopic data obtained before and after such events , we found that the defects experience changes of both their asymmetry and tunneling energies , while the strain dependence of @xmath1 remains very similar .",
    "a sudden change in tls parameters also occurred between measurements of the defect spectrum and that of the fully excited tls1-tls2 system ( see appendix b ) , by which the tls1 energy shifted by approximately 100  mhz towards lower frequencies . since after the jump",
    ", the theoretical spectrum is found to still coincide with the anti - crossing on the left side of the `` s '' ( data not shown ) , we can conclude that @xmath119 did not change appreciable in comparison to @xmath120 at the tls1-tls2 anti - crossing .",
    "the aim of the experiment discussed here is to measure the transition energies of the coupled tls1-tls2 system around the anti - crossing at @xmath62  v on the right side of the `` s''-shaped signature shown in supplementary figure  [ fig : figure3_app ] .",
    "the energies of the four levels @xmath121 , @xmath85 and @xmath56 are illustrated in fig .",
    "4  a. while the splitting size equals @xmath25 , the energetic shift of the anti - crossing from @xmath122 , which corresponds to the unperturbed tls energies @xmath57 and @xmath58 , yields @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "fig .  4  b visualizes the pulse sequence for this experiment .",
    "the upper image of fig .",
    "4  c shows a zoom of the right anti - crossing with the two branches . after exciting the qubit with a @xmath11-pulse ,",
    "the excitation is swapped to one of the branches by tuning the qubit for the swap time to the corresponding energies around @xmath123 or @xmath124 .",
    "afterwards , the qubit is excited a second time and tuned to lower frequencies in order to search for the transition that fully excites the tls system .",
    "this occurs at energies around @xmath125 or @xmath126 , respectively , and the qubit will loose its excitation yielding an additional dark trace in the spectrum image ( data not shown ) .",
    "the two plots obtained in this way , one for each branch into which the first excitation was swapped , are subtracted from each other yielding peaks or dips at the relevant energies and zero for the background ( fig .",
    "4  d , lower plot ) . for better visibility ,",
    "a color - map has been chosen such that peaks in fig",
    ".  4  c , which correspond to first exciting the lower branch , appear in green and the dips , arising if the qubit excitation was first swapped to the upper branch , show up red .",
    "the coupling constants between the two tlss , and also the tls energies in the uncoupled case , can now be directly extracted from the data : @xmath127 with the known ratio of the tunneling and asymmetry energies of tls2 , @xmath91 , @xmath44 and @xmath90 ( supplementary eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_full_param ] ) ) can be calculated ( see tab .",
    "in order to obtain a rough estimate of the distance between the coupled tls , several assumptions have to be made .",
    "first of all , for the calculation we assume that the mutual tls interaction is solely due to electrical dipole coupling , i.e. we neglect any contribution due to elastic coupling .",
    "the interaction strength can then be written as  @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the relative position vector from tls1 to tls2 and their electrical dipole moments @xmath130 are decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of the tls electrical dipole moments by their components parallel to the electric field in the josephson junction , which can be determined as described in supplementary note 3 .",
    "the qubit - tls coupling strength @xmath131 is the product between the tls dipole moment and the electrical field in the junction  @xcite , @xmath132 where @xmath133 2 nm is the thickness of the junction s tunnel barrier , @xmath134 ff the qubit s capacitance and @xmath135 ghz the qubit s energy level splitting at resonance with the tls . using the values of table  i , we obtain @xmath136 e   and @xmath137 e .",
    "finally , we assume @xmath138 and use supplementary eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdd - perp - par ] ) with @xmath139 ( saphhire ) to estimate the maximal distance between the tls , which results in r = 4.1 nm and r = 5.2 nm , for horizontal and vertical arrangements of the tlss , respectively .",
    "we note that this maximal vertical distance exceeds the thickness of the tunnel barrier .",
