    "many astrophysical phenomena ( snrs , @xmath0-ray bursts - grbs , agn hot spots , etc . ) are believed to involve radiative shock waves .",
    "these shocks accelerate particles which emit the observed radiation . in particular , it is widely accepted that the recently discovered grbs afterglow results from an emission by relativistic shocks , created by the interaction between an initial ejecta and the interstellar medium .",
    "the recent observations of grb afterglow have lead to numerous attempts to model this phenomena .    if the radiative mechanisms are slow compared to hydrodynamics time scale , the blast wave evolution is adiabatic .",
    "the propagation of such a blast wave is described be a self similar solution : the sedov - taylor solution ( @xcite ) describes the newtonian regime and the blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) solution describes the extreme relativistic regime .",
    "we call the solution radiative if the radiative mechanisms are fast compared to the hydrodynamic time scale .",
    "a fully radiative solution is one in which all the energy generated by the shock is radiated away . @xcite",
    "have shown that if a fully radiative blast wave emits its energy only in the vicinity of the shock , it can be described by one of two possible self - similar solutions : the pressure driven snow - plow ( pds ) or the momentum conserving snow - plow ( mcs ) solution . in the pds solution a thin shell `` snow plows '' through the external medium , driven by the pressure of its hot , roughly isobaric , interior . in the mcs solution the interior has been cooled and a thin shell slows down while conserving momentum . @xcite have found an extreme relativistic fully radiative solution .",
    "this solution describes a thin shell with a cold interior and it can be considered as the relativistic generalization of the newtonian mcs solution .",
    "however , momentum is not conserved in this solution , as in the relativistic case one has to consider the momentum carried by the emitted radiation .",
    "these solutions are either adiabatic or fully radiative .",
    "it is likely that in some cases not all the energy would be radiated away , even though the cooling is fast .",
    "such is the situation if the shock distributes the internal energy between the electrons and protons and there is no coupling between the two afterwards .",
    "since only the electrons cool , only a fraction of the internal energy will be radiated .",
    "it is likely that at least in the initial phases of a grb afterglow this would be the case .",
    "we consider here this `` partially radiative '' scenario .",
    "the goal of our paper is to find an analytic solution for the evolution of newtonian and relativistic partially radiative blast waves .",
    "this , we believe , will eventually lead to a physical description of the evolution of grb afterglows in their non - adiabatic stage , and of other astrophysical phenomena .",
    "we find a self similar solution under the assumption that the radiative mechanism is fast ( compared to the hydrodynamics time scale ) .",
    "we parameterize the radiation by a dimensionless ( the non dimensionality is essential for a self - similar solution ) parameter , @xmath1 , which describes the fraction of the energy produced by the shock that is radiated away .",
    "we recover the extreme relativistic adiabatic blandford - mckee solution and the newtonian sedov - taylor solution in the corresponding limit when @xmath2 . in the newtonian case when @xmath3 we recover the pds solution , but we do not reproduce the mcs solution . similarly in the relativistic limit of @xmath4 the solution approaches a new relativistic pds solution which is different from the radiative blandford - mckee solution .",

    "we consider the regime where the influence of the initial mass is negligible and that the pressure of the surrounding medium is small compared to the energy density of the flow .",
    "these assumptions are necessary and sufficient to obtain a self similar solution , see e.g. @xcite , pg . 404 .",
    "this solution corresponds in the adiabatic limit to the well known newtonian sedov - taylor solution or to the relativistic blandford - mckee solution .",

    "we assume that the radiation does not alter the shock itself , which remains adiabatic , and that a radiative layer follows it . however , the shock jump conditions ( rankine - hugoniot in the newtonian case and taub in the relativistic case ) are derived from the same conservation equations . thus , even though we divide the process into a shock and a radiative layer we effectively use the conservation equations between the unshocked matter and the shocked matter after it has been cooled .",

    "we assume that all the matter is concentrated in a narrow shell , and look for a self similar solution .",

    "this behavior is consistent with our assumption that new matter accretes only on the expanding shell .",
    "the existence of two possible solutions with the same boundary conditions is unusual .",
    "therefore , one should recognize the physical conditions which leads to each of the self similar solutions .",
    "@xcite have found numerically that a supernova remnant ( snr ) evolves initially according to the adiabatic sedov - taylor solution , becomes pds when the energy loss near the shock becomes important , and finally becomes mcs when other processes cool the blast wave interior .",
    "@xcite has investigated blast waves with power - law cooling functions , @xmath159 .",
    "he has found that @xmath160 leads to the mcs solution , @xmath161 leads to the pds solution and other values of @xmath162 do not lead to self similar solutions . since lower values of @xmath162 correspond to less effective cooling in lower temperature ( i.e. , to a more adiabatic interior ) , no interior cooling results , asymptotically , in the pds solution .",
    "approaching the limit @xmath3 , without taking into account interior cooling , results in the pds solution . during the pds expansion",
    "no matter enters the interior which expands adiabatically .",
    "incorporating even an infinitesimal interior cooling will cool the interior down eventually , and the blast wave will asymptotically approach the mcs solution .",
    "therefore , the limit of a fully radiative blast wave with adiabatic interior results in the mcs or pds solution depending on the way we reach the limit of an adiabatic interior .. our self similar solution reaches the pds solution in the @xmath89 limit .",
    "this is due to the adiabatic interior assumption , which , following the previous arguments , forbids a mcs solution .",
    "@xcite have calculated the dynamics of a fully radiative relativistic blast wave with an impulsive supply of energy , treating the swept - up matter as lying in a thin , cold shell adjacent to the shock and assuming a cold interior ( similarly to the newtonian mcs solution ) .",

    "an analytic treatment of the validity of the mcs and pds solution does not exist in the relativistic case .",
    "however , in view of the newtonian solution we expect that interior cooling is needed in order to obtain the mcs solution .      using the conditions at the shock , and our radiation model with parameter @xmath1 , we have found the energy loss rate for the newtonian ( eq .

    "this result differs from @xcite due to a missing factor of @xmath90 in his lorentz transformation of the energy density ( see footnote [ four_thirds ] ) .",
    "we conclude by noting that in the newtonian and in the extreme relativistic limits , the change in the blast wave evolution causes the energy to decrease slower than what was calculated earlier using adiabatic estimates .",
    "we have solved the hydrodynamical evolution of blast waves in which each shocked particle emits a fixed fraction of the energy it gains in the shock .",
    "we have divided the blast wave into three regions : the adiabatic shock , the radiative layer , and the adiabatic interior . the adiabatic shock and the radiation layer",
    "were combined to form a `` radiative shock '' , which set the boundary conditions for the adiabatic interior .    for fast cooling cases",
    "we have obtained a solution for a planar radiative layer with arbitrary shock velocities , independent of the cooling process .",
    "we have found that in the shock frame the fluid cools , slows down and its pressure _ increases _ during the cooling process .",
    "we have obtained self similar solutions for adiabatic interior for the newtonian and the extreme relativistic cases .",
    "we find that radiation can change the hydrodynamics considerably . because of this change in the blast wave evolution the luminosity decays slower ( in time ) than what was estimated earlier assuming that the self similar profiles are independent of the radiated energy .",
    "we have also found that as a blast wave becomes more radiative , its matter concentrates near the shock and forms a dense shell .",
    "however , the internal pressure does not drop to zero . in the fully radiative limit of newtonian blast waves",
    "we have reached the pressure - driven solution .",
    "we have obtained a new extreme relativistic solution for fully radiative blast wave , which resembles the newtonian pds solution .",
    "our self similar solutions reach this modified solution in the fully radiative limit .",
    "this solution does not correspond to the blandford - mckee radiative solution .",
    "the pressure must be continuous within the adiabatic interior and it can not develop self a similar shock or a rarefraction wave ( apart from the main strong shock with the ism ) .",
    "therefore , even in the newtonian pds limit with isobaric interior , the solution contains a self similar transition layer between the `` radiative shock '' conditions and the internal pressure .",
    "the recently discovered x - ray , optical and radio emission following a grb , so called `` afterglow '' is widely believed to be the result of the deceleration of a relativistic material that collides with the surrounding matter . according to the common model , the shock wave produced by the collision accelerates electrons to relativistic velocities",
    ". these electrons , that carry a fixed fraction of the internal energy produced by the shock emit synchrotron radiation which is the observed afterglow . for reasonable parameters , the electron cooling is fast ( at least in the early stages of the afterglow evolution ) , so that the electrons loose most of their energy .",
    "since the density behind the shock is low , the coupling between the electrons and the protons is negligible .",
    "therefore , the protons energy is not radiated away .",
    "this leads to a partially radiative rather than a fully radiative shock , followed by an adiabatic flow .",
    "this is _ exactly _ the scenario that leads to the partially radiative blast waves derived in this paper .",
    "our new self similar partially radiative blast wave can serve as the basic hydrodynamic solution from which spectra and light curves of the afterglow can be calculated .",
    "in particular we derive a new @xmath185 relation ( eqs .",
    "[ r : m_of_eps ] , [ g_of_t ] ) between the lorentz factor and the radius .",
