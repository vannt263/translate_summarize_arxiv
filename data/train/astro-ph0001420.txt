    "when a magnetic accretion disk surrounds a black hole , the magnetic field lines frozen in the disk drift toward the black hole as the disk plasma is slowly accreted onto the black hole . after the accreted plasma particles get into the black hole ,",
    "the magnetic field lines which were frozen to the plasma are released and then thread the black hole s horizon .",
    "so the black hole is magnetized and an approximately stationary and axisymmetric magnetic field is formed around it ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) . the existence of a disk is necessary for confining the magnetic field lines threading the black hole .",
    "if the black hole is rotating , the magnetic field lines threading it are twisted and toroidal components of magnetic field and thus poloidal electric currents are generated . if the other ends of the magnetic field lines connect with remote non - rotating astrophysical loads , the rotating black hole exerts a torque on the astrophysical loads and the rotational energy of the black hole is extracted and transported to the astrophysical loads via poynting flux .",
    "this is the so - called blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) . for a long time",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism has been considered to be a plausible way to power the extragalactic jets ( rees et al 1982 ; begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ; ferrari 1998 ) .",
    "[ recently some people have argued that the blandford - znajek mechanism may be less efficient since the electromagnetic power from the accretion disk may dominate the electromagnetic power from the black hole ( ghosh & abramowicz 1997 ; livio , ogilvie , & pringle 1999 ; li 1999 ) .",
    "blandford and znajek have also mentioned this possibility in their original paper ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "but the situation may be different for a black hole with a geometrically thick disk ( armitage & natarajan 1999 ) . ]    for magnetic field configurations with both poloidal components and toroidal components , the screw instability plays a very important role ( kadomtsev 1966 ; bateman 1978 ; freidberg 1987 ) . if the toroidal magnetic field is so strong that from one end to the other end the magnetic field lines wind around the symmetry axis once or more , the magnetic field and the plasma confined by it become unstable against long - wave mode perturbations , and the plasma column quickly twists into a helical shape . to maintain a stable magnetic field structure around the black hole , which is necessary for the working of the blandford - znajek mechanism , the toroidal components of the magnetic field and the poloidal currents can not exceed the limits set by the kruskal - shafranov condition which is the criterion for the screw instability ( kadomtsev 1966 ; freidberg 1987 ) .",
    "recently gruzinov has shown that if some magnetic field lines connect a black hole with an accretion disk , the black hole s rotation twists the magnetic field lines sufficiently to excite the screw instability .",
    "this can make the black hole to produce quasi - periodical flares , and is argued to be a new mechanism for extracting the rotational energy of black hole ( gruzinov 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the screw instability of magnetic field play a very important role in the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "to make the magnetic field and the plasma confined by it safe against the screw instability , the toroidal components of the magnetic field and thus the poloidal electric currents can not be too big , which significantly lower the power of the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "the screw instability puts a stringent upper bound to the power of the blandford - znajek mechanism if the distance from the black hole to the astrophysical loads exceeds some critical value .",
    "the implications of the results for the scenario of extragalactic jets powered by the blandford - znajek mechanism are discussed .",
    "it s argued that jets powered by the blandford - znajek mechanism can not be dominated by poynting flux at large scales and can not be collimated by their own toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "the power of the blandford - znajek mechanism is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the angular velocity of the black hole , @xmath2 is the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines , @xmath3 is the radius of the black hole horizon , @xmath4 is the poloidal magnetic field on the black hole horizon ( on the horizon the poloidal magnetic field has only normal components ) , and @xmath5 is the magnetic flux through the northern hemisphere of the black hole horizon ( macdonald & thorne 1982 ) .",
    "( throughout the paper we use the geometric units with @xmath6 . )    on the horizon of the black hole , the toroidal magnetic field @xmath7 is related to the poloidal electric current @xmath8 flowing into the horizon by @xmath9 suppose the magnetic field is aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "the current is related to the poloidal magnetic field on the horizon by @xmath10 inserting eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ bt ] ) , we obtain a relation between the toroidal magnetic field and the poloidal magnetic field on the horizon @xmath11 which can also be written as @xmath12    inserting eq .",
    "( [ btp ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) and using @xmath13 , we get @xmath14",
    "for a cylindrical magnetic field with both poloidal and toroidal components ( the so - called screw pinch configuration ) , the kink safety factor is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the length of the cylinder , @xmath17 is the radius of the cylinder , @xmath18 is the poloidal component of the magnetic field which is parallel to the axis of the cylinder , and @xmath19 is the toroidal component of the magnetic field which is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder .",
    "the screw instability turns on when @xmath20 which is called the kruskal - shafranov criterion ( kadomtsev 1966 , freidberg 1987 ) .",
    "though this criterion is usually proved only in flat spacetime , gruzinov has shown that it also holds for the force - free magnetosphere around a kerr black hole ( gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "the screw instability is very important for tokamaks and pinches ( bateman 1978 ) . since it is a kind of long - wave mode instability , the screw instability can quickly disrupt the global structure of magnetic field .",
    "now consider a quasi - cylindrical magnetic field configuration above the northern hemisphere of the black hole horizon .",
    "then the kink safety factor is given by eq .",
    "( [ safe1 ] ) .",
    "if the magnetic flux and electric current in the cylinder are conserved , we have @xmath21 then the kink safety factor can be expressed with @xmath22 and @xmath7 @xmath23 from eq .",
    "( [ safe ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ insta ] ) , for the magnetic field to be safe against the screw instability ( thus we require @xmath24 ) , we must require @xmath25 eq .",
    "( [ btu ] ) gives an upper bound on the toroidal components of the magnetic field for a stable magnetic configuration .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ bt ] ) , the constraint on the induced poloidal electric current is @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ btu ] ) , the constraint on the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is required by that energy is extracted from the black hole .",
    "the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines ( and thus the toroidal components of the magnetic field and the induced poloidal electric current ) is determined by the rotation of the black hole and the inertia of the remote astrophysical loads . in the optimal case ,",
    "i.e. when the power takes its maximum , @xmath29 ( which is called the impedance matching condition ) ( macdonald & thorne 1982 ) .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ wfu ] ) , for the impedance matching case the magnetic field is stable only if @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath32 is the angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole [ @xmath33 . in other words",
    ", the impedance matching condition can be achieved only if @xmath34 .",
    "from eq .  ( [ powera ] ) , eq .  ( [ btu ] ) , and @xmath35 , we obtain an upper bound on the power of the blandford - znajek mechanism immediately : @xmath36 . with more detailed analysis [ using eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) for @xmath2 instead of simply replacing @xmath2 with @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ powera ] ) ] , we obtain @xmath37 where @xmath38 which measures the distance that the blandford - znajek process can work on ; @xmath39 which is the power of the blandford - znajek process in the optimal case ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "( [ pzero ] ) differs from the result of macdonald et al ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) by a factor of @xmath41 but this is not important for our current purposes . ]",
    "when @xmath42 [ i.e. @xmath43 , the impedance matching condition can be achieved and thus the upper bound on the power is given by @xmath44 [ eq .  ( [ pzero ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , we obtain the upper bounds on the power of the blandford - znajek mechanism @xmath45 if @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the power of blandford - znajek mechanism is significantly lowered by the screw instability of magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the power limit arising from the screw instability can also be stated as follow : for a given power @xmath48 the blandford - znajek process can only operate within the distance @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the efficiency of the blandford - znajek mechanism ( @xmath51 always ) .",
    "( [ lmax ] ) shows an interesting anti - correlation between the power of the central engine ( black hole ) and the maximum distance that the central engine can work at .",
    "for the blandford - znajek process to work efficiently ( i.e. @xmath52 ) , the distance @xmath16 can not be larger than @xmath53 ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "extragalactic jets are usually thought to be associated with very powerful energetic processes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the blandford - znajek process associated with a rapidly rotating supermassive black hole has been considered to be a possible mechanism for powering extragalactic jets since it provides a practical way for extracting the vast rotational energy of the black hole ( rees et al 1982 ; begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ) .    from the discussions in previous sections ,",
    "the screw instability of magnetic field prevents the blandford - znajek mechanism from working at large distances from the black hole . for the blandford - znajek mechanism to work efficiently ( i.e. @xmath54 )",
    ", the distance within which the blandford - znajek mechanism works must satisfy [ see eq .",
    "( [ lmax ] ) ] @xmath55 typical extragalactic jets have lengths from several kiloparsecs to several hundred kiloparsecs ( bridle & perley 1984 ) , which are much larger than the limit given by eq .",
    "( [ length ] ) .",
    "if the blandford - znajek process really works in agn , it can only work within the distance limited by eq .",
    "( [ length ] ) unless it has an extremely low efficiency . beyond that distance , either magnetic flux or poloidal",
    "current ( or both ) must fail to be conserved within the tube of fluid lines .",
    "[ remember that as we move from eq .",
    "( [ safe1 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ safe ] ) we have only used the conservation of magnetic flux and poloidal current . ]",
    "this implies that the magnetic field and poloidal current originating from the central black hole can not extend to large distances in the jets , the astrophysical loads in the blandford - znajek mechanism have to be located at a very short distance from the central black hole [ the distance is limited by eq .",
    "( [ length ] ) ] .",
    "so , the bulk of poynting flux from the central black hole is converted into the kinetic energy of plasma particles at the very beginning of jets  in fact the distance given by eq .",
    "( [ length ] ) is too close to the black hole to be resolved with current observations ( junor , biretta , & livio 1999 ) .",
    "the jets so produced can not be dominated by poynting flux at large radii and can not be collimated by their own magnetic fields . therefore",
    ", the screw instability of magnetic field gives significant constraints on the scenario of jets powered by the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "the transition from a poynting flux dominated jet to a matter dominated one could happen very close to the central black hole , but the collimation of such a jet at large radii might be problematic . though current observations can not tell if extragalactic jets are poynting flux dominated , some observations show that much of the particle acceleration occurs at @xmath56  pc from the central black hole ( heinz & begelman 1997 )",
    "considering the screw instability of magnetic field , the blandford - znajek mechanism can only work within a finite distance from the black hole . beyond that distance ,",
    "either the conservation of poloidal current or the conservation of magnetic flux ( or both ) must break down  otherwise the screw instability comes in and the global magnetic field structure is disrupted .",
    "the distance from the black hole to the boundary within which the blandford - znajek mechanism can work is @xmath57 where @xmath58 always .",
    "if @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the blandford - znajek mechanism can only work efficiently in the close neighborhood of the black hole .    in applying our results to extragalactic jets",
    ", we have found that the screw instability significantly constrains the scenario of extragalactic jets powered by the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "the jets produced by the blandford - znajek mechanism can not be dominated by poynting flux at large distances from the central engine and can not be collimated by their own magnetic fields .",
    "though people have discussed various magnetohydrodynamic instabilities for the propagation and acceleration of jets ( appl & camenzind 1992 ; begelman 1998 and references therein ) , nobody has considered the constraint on the power of the central engine .",
    "the results in this paper have shown that the screw instability of magnetic field significantly constrains the power of the central engine .",
    "the discussions can also be extended to the case when jets are produced by electromagnetic processes associated with an accretion disk ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "since the radius of disk is usually larger than the radius of black hole , and jets produced by disk is less likely to be poynting flux dominated due to that the coronae of accretion disk are full of mass , the jets produced by accretion disk seem to be less vulnerable to the screw instability than the jets produced by black hole ."
