    "an effective area of 8032degree@xmath30 was assumed ( see simard et  al .",
    "unfortunately , we have no direct test to assess whether the sdss masses and sizes are on the same system as the 3d - hst data .",
    "there is no evidence to the contrary : as shown in bezanson et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) there are no obvious systematic differences in sizes or masses between this sdss sample and the extrapolation to @xmath5 of distant galaxy samples analyzed in the same way as done here .",
    "the parent sample constitutes all galaxies in the five 3d - hst / candels fields that have a photometric `` use '' flag of 1 ( see skelton et al .",
    "2014 ) and a structural parameter fit flag of 0 or 1 ( see van der wel et  al . 2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "for all these galaxies ( essentially the entire 3d - hst v4.0 catalog ) we calculated the stellar mass that is contained within a radius of 1kpc .",
    "following bezanson et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) we first deprojected the best - fitting sersic profile using an abel transform : @xmath41 with @xmath42 the 3d luminosity density in a particular filter , @xmath43 , @xmath44 the circularized effective radius , @xmath45 the sersic index , and @xmath46 the @xmath45-dependent normalization parameter of the sersic profile ( see , e.g. , peng et  al .",
    "this deprojection is important as the projected mass within 1kpc is influenced by the properties of the galaxy at larger radius .",
    "in particular , for a given density ( in m@xmath47kpc@xmath15 ) within a sphere of radius 1kpc , larger and more massive galaxies have a higher projected density ( in m@xmath47kpc@xmath48 ) .",
    "we note that this methodology may lead to errors for galaxies that are far from spherical symmetry , in particular for flat disks .",
    "we return to this in  5.3 .",
    "next , the mass within @xmath1kpc was calculated by integrating the 3d luminosity profiles . a small ( typically @xmath49% ) correction to the masses",
    "was applied to take into account that the total magnitude in the catalog is not identical to the total magnitude implied by the sersic fit ( see taylor et  al . 2010 ) .",
    "this same correction was applied to the total masses used in later sections .",
    "we also assume that mass follows light .",
    "this assumption is probably reasonable in a relative sense , as there is no evidence that color gradients ( and hence @xmath39 gradients ) are a strong function of redshift ( see szomoru et  al .",
    "combining all these aspects , the core mass is given by @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the mass of the galaxy in the 3d - hst catalog , @xmath52 is the total , aperture - corrected luminosity of the galaxy in a particular filter in the 3d - hst catalog , and @xmath53 is the total luminosity implied by the sersic fit .",
    "finally , the measurements for @xmath54 derived from the @xmath28 fit and from the @xmath29 fit were interpolated so that the final value corresponds to a rest - frame wavelength of 6000  for @xmath55 .",
    "at @xmath56 we use @xmath28 and at @xmath57 we use @xmath29 . we note that this interpolation is not a critical step : the effect on the derived masses is typically @xmath58% , and using the core mass derived from either @xmath28 or @xmath29 throughout does not change the results significantly .    the difference between total mass and core mass is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ examples.fig ] .",
    "the figure shows @xmath29 images of three galaxies at @xmath59 , along with a graphical representation of their surface density . the galaxy on the left is a massive elliptical galaxy with a dense core .",
    "not all massive galaxies have a high central density : the middle galaxy has a mass that is nearly identical to the galaxy on the left and a relatively low mass core .",
    "the galaxy on the right is an example of a galaxy whose total mass is only slightly higher than its core mass ; this galaxy resembles the compact quiescent galaxies that are relatively common at high redshift .",
    "the galaxies on the left and right are included in our @xmath21 sample ( see  [ ndens.sec ] ) , and the galaxy in the middle is not .",
    "we note here that we do not measure the ( deprojected ) light in the central regions directly , but use the best - fitting sersic profiles as a proxy for the light at @xmath60kpc .",
    "the central kpc covers @xmath61 drizzled wfc3 pixels , and we could have used a direct measurement of the flux within this aperture . using the sersic fits instead takes the effects of the psf into account , and enables the deprojection described above . as described in van der wel et al .",
    "( 2012 , 2014 ) these fits are stable even for galaxies with @xmath62kpc ; the total uncertainties in @xmath45 and @xmath44 are @xmath63% and @xmath49% respectively , for @xmath64 ( see van der wel et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , it is possible that our results are affected by ( large ) galaxies whose surface brightness profiles deviate strongly from a sersic profile .",
    "the procedures followed for the ultravista / zrich galaxies at @xmath35 and for the sdss galaxies at @xmath65 were similar to those described above .",
    "the only difference in procedure is that the ultravista masses were not corrected for the difference between total catalog magnitudes and the total fluxes implied by the gim2d fit . in appendix [ uvista.sec ]",
    "we compare the ultravista masses to the 3d - hst masses for objects that are in both catalogs .",
    "a redshift - dependent offset was applied to the ultravista masses so they are consistent with the 3d - hst masses .",
    "the origin of this offset is not understood ; we conservatively increase the formal uncertainty in the ultravista masses by the same amount so that an offset of zero , or of twice the applied offset , are within the @xmath66 errorbars in all plots . after applying",

    "the amount of mass loss is a strong function of the mass and surface gravity of the stars that are present in the population , and therefore a strong function of both the age and the imf .",
    "previous studies have considered the effects of mass loss on the evolution of the mass - size relation , particularly in the context of the size growth of quiescent galaxies ( damjanov et  al .",
    "as mass loss leads to adiabatic expansion , passively evolving galaxies become both less massive and larger with time ; however , these effects are small compared to the observed evolution of the sizes and masses of quiescent galaxies ( damjanov et  al .",

    "the second effect is that the matter in galaxies can be redistributed as a result of adiabatic expansion .",
    "this effect is only important if the material in the winds mixes with the hot halo gas , which in turn depends on the details of the interaction of the wind material with the ambient gas ( e.g. , bregman & parriott 2009 , conroy et al .",

    "we briefly consider several other explanations for the apparent negative evolution of the number density of dense cores .",
    "one possibility is that the structure of galaxies changes in such a way that the deprojected core masses change systematically with redshift .",

    "the function is offset to lower masses , as expected , but there is no significant redshift - dependent effect .",

    "the presence of flat density profiles in the centers of massive , slowly rotating elliptical galaxies ( faber et  al .",

    "perhaps the most important alternative explanation is systematic error .",
    "a redshift - dependent error in the stellar masses of @xmath129 dex per unit redshift could fully explain the evolution .",
    "combined with the ( inevitable ) effects of mass loss , the ( small ) effects of black hole scouring , and the ( uncertain ) effects of merging , we conclude that the uncertainties allow a factor of @xmath106 evolution in the number density , in either direction .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the dense cores studied in this paper are extreme environments by local universe standards .",
