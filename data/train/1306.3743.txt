    "however , an isolated , single first star is too faint to be observed @xcite .",
    "detecting supernova ( sn ) explosions of the first stars is an interesting possibility worth pursuing .",
    "a single sn explosion can give rise to a luminosity of @xmath8 , powered by the radioactive energy or the kinetic energy of the explosion .",
    "note that the luminosity of sne is comparable to high - redshift galaxies recently discovered with hubble space telescope ( hst , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is more than a few orders of magnitude higher than the luminosity of a single very massive star ( @xmath9 for a 500 @xmath10 star , @xcite ) .    because of this advantage",
    ", detectability of sne at high redshift have been studied in the past literature ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies revealed , however , that normal core - collapse sne are too faint to be detected at @xmath11 .",
    "detection of normal sne at @xmath12 requires observations deeper than 30 ab mag in near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , which can be reached only with a long exposure of jwst ( @xmath13 seconds for 5 @xmath14 significance ) .    in this circumstance ,",
    "several literatures @xcite have examined the detectability of pair - instability sne ( pisne , see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "pisne give rise to an extremely high luminosity ( @xmath15 ) powered by @xmath16 1 - 10 @xmath10 of @xmath17ni , and , they can be as bright as @xmath18 ab mag in nir at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "these works in part were motivated by the discovery of a pisn candidate sn",
    "2007bi @xcite .",
    "it is noted that there is ongoing debate on typical masses of population iii stars .",
    "theoretically , both very massive stars ( @xmath20 , as massive as progenitor of pisne , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and ordinary massive stars ( @xmath21 , e.g. ,  @xcite ) might have existed in the early universe .",
    "observationally , the existence of ordinary massive stars are corroborated by chemical abundances of metal poor stars ( e.g. ,  @xcite , see @xcite for ongoing search of pisn signature ) .",
    "the recent discovery of superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) opens a new window to observe sn explosions of the first stars .",
    "slsne are thought to be powered by a huge amount of @xmath17ni  @xcite and/or strong interaction with the circumstellar material ( csm ) .",
    "the latter is supported by characteristic type iin spectra , e.g. ,  narrow hydrogen emission lines , in some slsne - ii ( slsn with hydrogen , according to the classification by @xcite ) , such as sne 2006gy @xcite and 2008fz @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of radiation hydrodynamics of sn explosion with dense csm have been performed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m13 ) , who found that their models can reproduce the light curve of sn 2006gy . thanks to the high luminosity , slsne are ideal targets at high redshift universe .",
    "in fact , a few slsne and luminous type iin sne have been detected at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite ; m13 ; @xcite that slsne and luminous type iin sne are bright enough to be detected at @xmath23 .",
    "however , slsne are known to be extremely rare ( @xmath24 of core - collapse sne , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , an important question still remains ; is there enough number of high - redshift sne in the limited observational area that can be observed with realistic observational resources ?     10 ( top ) , 15 ( middle ) , and 20 ( bottom ) .",

    "we showed about 100 slsne up to @xmath25 can be detected with upcoming subaru / hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) deep survey , which reaches 24.5 mag depth in @xmath26-band . by using ultra deep survey for 3.5 deg@xmath0 ( 25.6 mag in @xmath26-band ) ,",
    "the maximum redshift can be as high as @xmath27 .",
    "we also showed that deep nir survey can detect slsne even at @xmath28 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the study of paper i to redshifts beyond @xmath29 , which is near the end of reionization of the universe , with a special emphasis on @xmath5 , the era of the first star formation .",

    "paper i performed detailed simulations with realistic , planned observational strategy for subaru hyper suprime - cam ( hsc , @xcite ) survey . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in section [ sec : optimization ] , it is useful to study a wide range of parameters to find the optimized survey strategy . in this section ,",
    "we present simpler simulations for optical surveys , but with a wider parameter space .    with optical surveys , detection of slsne up to @xmath27 is expected ( paper i ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to adopt a shorter duration of the survey and a higher cadence than those of nir surveys .",
    "here we simply adopt ( 1 ) 0.5-year survey and ( 2 ) 10-day cadence . for simplicity , simultaneous observations in the optical @xmath34 bands with the same limiting magnitudes are assumed .",
    "figure [ fig : area_depth_opt ] shows the expected total number of slsne at @xmath35 ( left ) and 4 ( right ) as a function of survey area and limiting magnitude per visit .",
    "all the simulations have been performed for case b sfr density ( better calibrated at @xmath36 than case a sfr density ) and model 08es .",
    "our simulations are also applied for planned survey with large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , @xcite ) .",
    "lsst will perform 20000 deg@xmath0 survey in the optical @xmath34 bands .",
    "each visit consists of a short exposure ( 15 seconds ) , giving following limiting magnitudes ; 23.9 ( @xmath37 ) , 25.0 ( @xmath38 ) , 24.7 ( @xmath39 ) , 24.0 ( @xmath40 ) , 23.3 ( @xmath26 ) , and 22.1 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "each patch of the sky is visited about 100 - 200 times for 10 years .",
    "thus , the parameters of the survey using the single visit can be roughly approximated as ( 1 ) 3-month survey for each year ( repeating for 10 years ) and ( 2 ) 10-day cadence ( see table [ tab : param_opt ] ) .",
    "the black line in figure [ fig : hist_opt ] shows the expected number of slsne using the single visits of lsst .",
    "lsst will be able to discover about @xmath42 of slsne up to @xmath43 . in this overwhelming sample",
    ", some slsne ( @xmath44 ) may be discovered as extremely luminous sources because of the magnification by gravitational lensing ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    by appropriately stacking the data , giving a deeper limiting magnitude , the maximum redshift will be higher .",
    "one promising strategy is using `` deep drilling '' fields of lsst .",
    "about 10 % of the observing time will be devoted to observe several deep fields .",
    "even with 10 % of the observing time , if we limit the survey area to 100 deg@xmath0 and the survey duration to 0.5 year , deep observations ( with about 100 images stacked ) can be performed with 10-day cadence .",
    "such a deep image will give limiting magnitudes of about 26 mag ( table [ tab : param_opt ] , lsst deep drilling ) .",
    "simulations with these parameters show that lsst deep drilling observations will be able to detect about @xmath45 slsne up to @xmath46 ( pink line in figure [ fig : hist_opt ] ) ."
