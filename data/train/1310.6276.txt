    "a well - known open problem in fourier analysis is the bochner - riesz operator conjecture , which asserts the @xmath2-boundedness of the fourier multipliers @xmath3 on @xmath4 , so long as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the fourier transform in @xmath8 .",
    "the problem is well understood in dimensions @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but in higher dimensions , although there are several interesting results by many authors , it remains open .",
    "its relevance is due , on the one hand , to the very natural question being asked , but also because of its close connection with some other basic objects , namely the so - called kakeya maximal function , the restriction properties of the fourier transform , or the covering properties satisfied by parallelepipeds in @xmath8 having arbitrary directions and eccentricities .",
    "there is also the hope that obtaining deep understanding of the bochner - riesz operators could be a first step in the project of extending the classical caldern - zygmund theory of singular integrals , or pseudodifferential operators , going beyond kernels whose singularities are located only at the origin or at infinity , as is demanded in several areas of number theory or pdes .    in the extreme case , @xmath11 , the multiplier @xmath12 is given by the indicator function of the unit ball . by a remarkable result of c.  fefferman @xcite we know that it is bounded only in the obvious case @xmath13 , disproving the conjecture about the boundedness of @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 .    in its proof fefferman made use of the properties of the kakeya sets in the plane ( for every @xmath16 there is a set whose measure is less than @xmath17 but containing a rectangle of dimensions @xmath18 on every direction ) , but also of a previous result due to y.  meyer , who observed that the @xmath2-boundedness of @xmath14 implies a vector - valued control for hilbert transforms in different directions of the space . more concretely :    let @xmath19 then @xmath14 bounded on @xmath4 implies @xmath20 ( throughout this paper the symbol @xmath21 means that there exists @xmath22 independent of @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "we will also write @xmath27 to denote that the involved constant depends upon the parameter @xmath28 ) .",
    "it was precisely that vector - valued inequality , the one disproved by fefferman with the help of an appropriated kakeya set , which one may now describe as the main enemy of the bochner - riesz conjecture .",
    "one way of defeating the enemy was introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite for an independent proof ) : @xmath29 where the norm in @xmath0 is given by the integral @xmath30 with @xmath31 the uniform measure in the unit sphere and @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the polar coordinates in @xmath8 .    throughout this paper the proof given in @xcite will be revisited , improving some of the arguments and estimates .",
    "in particular we will show that meyer s lemma holds in the expected range @xmath15 so long as we substitute @xmath34 by @xmath0 .    for every @xmath35 , singular integrals ( i.e. integral operators whose",
    "kernels are given by @xmath36 , with @xmath37 ) yield bounded operators on @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is somehow surprising to realize that directional hilbert transforms @xmath38 defined by are bounded on @xmath0 if and only if @xmath15 .    to see that @xmath39 must necessarily lie in this range for the boundedness of @xmath38 it suffices to check the action of @xmath38 over the indicator function of a unit cube . however , the other implication is more involved and we will present two different proofs .",
    "one of them is on the spirit of meyer s lemma and makes use of the main result in @xcite .",
    "the second is based on properties of the _ universal kakeya maximal function _ : @xmath40 with the help of kakeya sets it is easy to see that @xmath41 can not be bounded on any space @xmath4 , @xmath42 .",
    "however we will present a geometric argument to show that , acting on radial functions @xmath23 , we have the estimate @xmath43 this was first proved in @xcite . here",
    "we will present a new proof using the old bush `` and brush '' methods of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . throughout this paper several weighted estimates for singular integrals play a crucial role .",
    "in particular the fact , discovered in @xcite , that for any @xmath44 , and any locally integrable function @xmath23 , we have that @xmath45 is a weight in the class @xmath46 such that @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the hardy - littlewood maximal function .",
    "however , this should not be a big surprise , because the main reason to ask the question raised in @xcite ( circa 1973 ) was to produce a functional machine to reduce the bochner - riesz multiplier problem to the boundedness properties of the kakeya maximal function , that is to the covering properties of parallelepipeds in @xmath8 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the formula @xmath49 yields perhaps the most interesting examples of @xmath50 weights .",
    "the other known cases are the radial powers @xmath51 , and in this paper we will make use of both classes . in particular we use that @xmath52 if and only if @xmath53 .",
    "but we also present an argument showing how the theory for the weights @xmath51 can also be deduced from the estimate    @xmath54    * acknowledgement .",
    "* i am grateful to diego crdoba , fernando chamizo and keith rogers for their useful comments and help in the preparation of the manuscript .",
    "consider the singular integral operator @xmath56 where @xmath57 is smooth enough and has zero mean value @xmath58 .    [ singular ]",
    "@xmath14 extends to a bounded operator from @xmath0 to itself when @xmath35 .",
    "it suffices to prove the theorem when @xmath59 because then the case @xmath60 will follow by duality .",
    "given @xmath61 and @xmath62 , let us consider @xmath63 by @xcite , we have @xmath64 for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denotes the hardy - littlewood maximal operator applied to the function @xmath67 . but",

    "again the other bound @xmath82 follows by duality .    to prove the if  part let us observe first that the @xmath55 norm is well - behaved under dilations and it is preserved under multiplication by characters @xmath83 :    if @xmath84 then @xmath85 therefore if @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the ball of radius @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 which produces the estimate @xmath90 uniformly on @xmath91 , so long as @xmath15 .",
    "next we consider the multiplier , @xmath92 , corresponding to the hilbert transform @xmath38 and we observe that its boundedness properties are equivalent to those of the fourier multiplier operator associates to the indicator function of hyperplanes @xmath93 .    given a function @xmath23 ( chosen so that its fourier transform @xmath94 has compact support ) the expression @xmath95 corresponds to the fourier multiplier given by the indicator function of the ball of radius @xmath96 centered at @xmath97 . choosing a convenient sequence of points @xmath97 and radius @xmath96 we can write @xmath98 then dominated convergence , together with the uniform bounds of @xmath99 in @xmath55 , @xmath15 , allows to finish the proof .",
    "a different proof of theorem  [ hbounded ] is the following :    we start with the integral @xmath100 we have @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the one - dimensional hardy - littlewood maximal function in the direction of @xmath103 and @xmath44 .",
    "as @xmath104 is radial one may consider its universal kakeya maximal function , defined in , to get the upper bound @xmath105 that is @xmath106 where @xmath71 .",
    "to finish we make use of the fact that @xmath41 is bounded on @xmath107 , @xmath108 , when restricted to radial functions @xcite :    observe that @xmath15 yields @xmath109 therefore given @xmath110 we choose @xmath44 so that @xmath111 to obtain @xmath112 which coincides with @xmath113 .",
    "[ meyer ] given @xmath114 , a countable family of directions in @xmath8 , and the corresponding directional hilbert transforms , @xmath115 , the following inequality holds : @xmath116 where @xmath15 .",
    "once more it is enough to prove it when @xmath117 and then use duality to cover the other cases .    given @xmath62 we consider the integrals @xmath118 that is @xmath119 and @xmath120 and the proof follows for the same reasons given in theorem  [ hbounded ] .",
    "we finnish this section by presenting a new proof , using old techniques , of the boundedness of the general kakeya maximal function acting on radial functions .",
    "related with these problems are maximal functions associated to vector fields in @xmath8 . given a continuous field of directions , @xmath121 , and a positive valued real function @xmath122 , let us consider @xmath123 as it is usual in differentiation theory , the behavior of those maximal operators produces quantitative versions of the lebesgue s differentation theorem . in general",
    "the problem is rather difficult but e.  stein and s.  wainger @xcite , and also several other authors @xcite , have created a theory which yields sufficient conditions for boundedness .",
    "however , for our discussion the following two examples are of special relevance :    1 .",
    "@xmath124 , @xmath125 . in this case",
    "@xmath48 is bounded on @xmath4 if and only if @xmath126 .",

    ". then @xmath48 is of weak - type ( 1,1 ) .",
    "2 .   in @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath125 . then @xmath48 is bounded on @xmath130 , @xmath35 .",

    "but @xmath138 is the result of translating the fixed curve @xmath139 to the point @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath141-plane , the maximal function is realized as @xmath142 where @xmath143 . in this",
    "setting we can apply the results of e.  stein and s.  wainger @xcite to finish the proof .    the result for the vector field * 2 ) * can be extended to higher dimensions if we restrict our attention to radial functions , because , in that case , we can take any direction perpendicular to the position vector @xmath26 without changing the value of the maximal function there .",
    "that is , considering the product structure @xmath144 the evaluation of the maximal function at the point @xmath145 can be obtained as the evaluation of its @xmath146-dimensional version acting on the slice @xmath147 .",
    "then an induction argument together with fubini s theorem gives the boundedness for every @xmath148 .",
    "our proof for @xmath41 will be then modeled upon these two extreme examples * 1 ) * and * 2 ) * , and it will make use of the geometry of parallelepipeds in @xmath8 to treat the intermediate case :    in @xmath8 , @xmath149 , the universal kakeya maximal function is unbounded on every @xmath4 , @xmath42 , as an appropriated kakeya set argument easily shows . however , acting on radial functions @xmath23 we have    [ urad ] @xmath150 if @xmath108 and @xmath23 is radial .    fixing a radial function @xmath23 and a positive number @xmath151",

    "furthermore , for a given @xmath26 and @xmath160 we will choose @xmath161 satisfying the inequality above and such that its sum @xmath162 is the biggest possible ; then among all such @xmath73 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , we select those maximizing the projection of the segment @xmath165 into the radial direction .    taking advantage of the radial symmetry and after some elementary geometrical considerations , the set @xmath166 is contained in an almost disjoint  union of annuli : @xmath167 satisfying the following properties :    1 .   for each annulus",

    "throughout this paper we have taken advantage of the fact that @xmath409 is a weight in the class @xmath46 , for every integrable function @xmath103 , whose @xmath50 bounds are estimated independently of @xmath103 .    this property was discovered ( see @xcite ) with the disc multiplier problem in mind , as an efficient manner of relating functionally the boundedness properties of singular integrals to maximal functions involving different directions of @xmath8 .    to our knowledge , the family @xmath410 is the more extended class of known weights ; the other known examples given by powers @xmath51 which have also played an important role in several proofs of this paper .",
