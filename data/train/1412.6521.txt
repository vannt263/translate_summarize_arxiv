    "consider a system at finite charge density and temperature .",
    "if momentum is conserved then a non - zero overlap between the electric current and the momentum operator leads to an infinite dc electrical conductivity .",
    "this feature is indeed observed in the simplest holographic model of such a system : the reissner - nordstrm - ads ( rn ) black brane .",
    "a natural way to build more realistic holographic models that allow momentum to dissipate is to modify the rn geometry such that translational invariance is broken explicitly along the boundary directions .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing spatially - dependent sources for ( neutral ) matter fields in the bulk .",
    "the backreaction of such sources typically leads to an inhomogeneous solution .",
    "examples include a spatially - periodic massive neutral scalar @xcite or chemical potential @xcite . in these studies",
    "the dc conductivity is indeed finite , in good agreement with the field theory calculation of @xcite , and the delta function is resolved into a drude peak of the form @xmath0 however , the study of such setups is technically involved because one must solve non - linear pdes .",
    "it is thus desirable to have a simpler holographic model that incorporates dissipation . in this way",
    "one may hope to uncover , in a computationally simple way , universal properties of field theories with holographic duals in which momentum can relax .",
    "one can obtain such a model with a homogeneous bulk geometry by exploiting the presence of a symmetry in the matter sector .",
    "for example , a set of massless scalar fields that are linear in the boundary coordinates were added to the usual einstein - maxwell system in @xcite .",
    "the shift symmetry of the scalars leads to a homogeneous bulk stress tensor .",
    "we shall refer to such scalars as axions . moreover , by choosing the axion configuration in a particular way it is also possible to render the geometry isotropic , allowing for the existence of an analytical black brane solution .",
    "the finite dc conductivity can be expressed analytically and , in four bulk dimensions , turns out to be independent of temperature .    at finite chemical potential , a transition from a coherent ( i.e.  drude - like ) metallic behaviour to an incoherent one as the parameter that controls the amount of momentum relaxation",
    "is increased was identified in this model by @xcite .",
    "a similar transition was observed in the thermal conductivity of this system at zero chemical potential in @xcite , wherein this feature was nicely explained in terms of the structure of the quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) of the black brane .",
    "there it was observed that the black brane conducts coherently when there is a purely - dissipative mode parametrically separated from the rest of the qnm .",
    "this model can be generalized in a number of ways .",
    "one is to introduce a further neutral scalar field , this time with a potential and couplings to the axions and maxwell field .",
    "we shall refer to such a scalar as a dilaton .",
    "momentum - dissipating black brane solutions to such theories were constructed in @xcite and referred to as ` q - lattices ' .",
    "the dc conductivity of these solutions is again finite and determined in terms of the horizon properties of the background @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite identified metallic and insulating phases , the latter of which being characterized by a vanishing dc conductivity at zero temperature . in the metallic phase , drude behaviour is observed for a large range of temperatures , while in the insulating phase the low frequency region is not described by drude physics .",
    "metal - insulator transitions were observed in similar models in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for further studies of such models and also @xcite for alternative generalizations .",
    "a conceptually distinct approach was considered in @xcite , wherein the theory of massive gravity @xcite was employed to remove translational invariance on the boundary as a result of breaking ( a subset of ) diffeomorphisms in the bulk .",
    "the resulting solutions possess a finite dc conductivity for which an analytical expression was provided in @xcite adapting a calculation in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was argued that there is a qualitative connection between massive gravity and a perturbative inhomogeneous lattice generated by a neutral scalar with spatially modulated boundary conditions .",
    "more precisely , the authors found that , at leading order in the lattice strength , the equations of motion that govern the conductivity are those of massive gravity if the radially - dependent graviton mass is proportional to the square of the neutral scalar .",
    "see @xcite for further studies of massive gravity in this context .",
    "the simplicity of these models makes them amenable to generalization , allowing us to conveniently study different field theory phenomena in setups in which translational invariance is broken .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study superconductivity in the presence of momentum relaxation , focusing on the axion model and a particular axion - dilaton model .",
    "to do so , we shall generalize the by now canonical model of holographic superconductivity of @xcite , consisting of an einstein - maxwell - charged scalar theory , by coupling it to the neutral scalar sectors of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the condensation of the charged order parameter is dual to the appearance of charged scalar hair on the black brane ( for scale invariant boundary conditions that set the source of the dual operator to zero ) as we lower the temperature below a critical value @xmath1 .",
    "superconducting inhomogeneous lattices were constructed in @xcite in an einstein - maxwell - charged scalar system with spatially - modulated chemical potential . below the critical temperature",
    ", the optical conductivity behaves at low frequencies as a two - fluid model consisting of a pole in the imaginary part plus a normal drude component : @xmath2 note that the appearance of a pole in the imaginary part demands there must be a delta function in the real part with strength set by @xmath3 in order to satisfy the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "as the temperature is decreased below @xmath1 , it was observed that the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 grow rapidly while @xmath5 quickly decreases .",
    "in addition , other simplified models of momentum relaxation have been utilized in the study of holographic superconductors .",
    "the condensation of a charged scalar was studied in a massive gravity theory in @xcite .",
    "where @xmath6 is the reference metric .",
    "this is different to the massive gravity theory whose optical conductivity coincides with that of @xcite . ]",
    "their results qualitatively agree with those in @xcite ; namely , they find a two - fluid model with a drude normal component . in @xcite , a charged scalar",
    "was coupled to the model of @xcite , which only has one neutral massless scalar .",
    "there it was observed that the critical temperature decreases as the scale of momentum dissipation increases and that a pseudo gap appears in the optical conductivity in the direction in which the breaking of translational invariance is introduced .",
    "see @xcite for work on the dynamical formation of a condensate in the same model .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied a holographic superconductor in an axion - dilaton model as we also do below , although with a different mass for the dilaton .",
    "there it was observed that the critical temperature is reduced by the presence of momentum relaxation and that breaking the @xmath7 from the metallic phase results in a two - fluid model behaviour with drude normal component .",
    "this is not so in the insulating phase , for which the normal component is not well described by a drude peak . see also @xcite for an alternative approach .    in this paper",
    "we construct superconducting solutions and observe the transition from all the unbroken phases we have considered ; namely , the exact solution of @xcite in the axion model and one choice of metallic and insulating solutions in the axion - dilaton model of @xcite .",
    "crucially , we first demonstrate that the broken phases are indeed thermodynamically preferred , confirming their physical relevance .",
    "our main result is the observation of a zero - frequency pole in the imaginary part of the electrical conductivity , confirming that our solutions are indeed superconducting .",
    "moreover , in cases in which the normal phase possesses a drude behaviour at low frequencies ( namely , in the axion model with small momentum dissipation parameter and the metallic solution in the axion - dilaton model ) , the broken phase can be described as a two - fluid model whose low - frequency conductivity is given by .",
    "we find that this can be explained by the structure of the lowest qnms : drude peaks arise when there is a purely - dissipative mode that is well - separated from the rest of the excitations , resembling the picture of @xcite .",
    "when this ceases to be true , we observe departures from the drude behaviour in the real part of the conductivity and thus the first term in must be modified .",
    "we study the temperature dependence of the parameters in for the broken phase of the metal of the axion - dilaton model .",
    "as we lower the temperature from @xmath1 , we find that @xmath4 first decreases slowly and then increases quickly , @xmath5 is monotonically decreasing reaching a small value , and @xmath3 monotonically increases approaching a constant .",
    "we find that @xmath3 exhibits the same behaviour in the broken phase of the insulator and also in the broken phase studied in the axion model .",
    "we also check the ferrell - glover - tinkham ( fgt ) sum rule @xcite , which relates ` missing ' spectral weight to the strength of the zero - frequency pole .",
    "we verify that the sum rule holds for the broken metallic phase and the broken phase in the axion model , as was also demonstrated for the inhomogeneous lattice of @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : axion ]",
    "we study the axion model coupled to a charged scalar .",
    "we describe a general class of solutions which implement momentum relaxation and discuss the calculation of the optical conductivity for such configurations . after a review of the normal phase and its conductivity , we move on to explore the broken phase . in section",

    "the charged scalar @xmath13 is dual to a scalar operator @xmath14 of dimension @xmath15 charged under a global @xmath7 .",

    "our main goal here is to study the optical conductivity in the broken phase of this model .",
    "both the normal phase and broken phase are described by black brane solutions .",
    "we make the following isotropic ansatz for the bulk fields : @xmath16 note that the metric is isotropic and homogeneous but the full solution is not due to the presence of the spatial dependence in the axion fields @xmath17 . the parameter @xmath18 is the strength of the translational symmetry breaking in the dual theory , and setting @xmath19 restores translational invariance .    in order to work at non - zero temperature in the field theory",
    "we demand a regular non - degenerate horizon at @xmath20 .",
    "this implies @xmath21 and that the temperature is given by @xmath22 we find the following asymptotic expansion near the ads@xmath10 boundary at @xmath23 : @xmath24 we consider the standard quantization of the charged scalar , in which @xmath25 is interpreted as the source and @xmath26 as the expectation value of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , a bulk solution with @xmath27 and @xmath28 corresponds to the broken phase in the dual theory .",
    "such solutions have been thoroughly investigated in the literature in the special case of @xmath19 , but in section  [ sec : brokenaxion ] we turn on @xmath29 , allowing us to study the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath7 symmetry in the presence of dissipation .",
    "the remaining parameters in this expansion have the following interpretation in the dual theory : @xmath30 is the chemical potential , @xmath31 is the total charge density and @xmath32 is proportional to the total energy density .",
    "the phase space of the dual theory is parametrized by the dimensionless quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in order to compute the optical conductivity",
    ", we consider fluctuations of the gauge field of the form @xmath35 .",
    "this couples to fluctuations of the metric and the axion fields , which we write as @xmath36 the equations that govern these fluctuations are @xmath37 note that the only difference when a charged scalar @xmath13 is turned on is an additional mass term for @xmath38 .",
    "near the conformal boundary , the linearized fields behave as @xmath39 the optical conductivity is defined via @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the retarded green s function for the current operator @xmath42 in the dual theory . in order to compute it",
    ", we need to turn on the source @xmath43 with all other sources set to zero .",
    "this can be achieved in a gauge - invariant way by requiring ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath44 in addition , to obtain the retarded correlator the linearized fields must satisfy ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon , which amounts to @xmath45 where the ellipses denote regular power series in @xmath46 .",
    "the leading order coefficients satisfy the relation @xmath47 imposing these conditions , we use a shooting method to read off the optical conductivity .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it will often be useful to study the quasi - normal frequencies of the black brane associated with such fluctuations .",
    "these are given by the poles in @xmath41 @xcite , which from are located at frequencies for which @xmath48 .    before moving forward to discuss our results for the broken phase ,",
    "first we review known results for both the dc and ac conductivity in the normal phase .",
    "we choose the following black brane solution as the normal phase @xcite : @xmath49 the parameter @xmath32 is determined by solving @xmath50 . the temperature of the black brane is simply @xmath51 it is clear that we recover the rn solution by setting @xmath52 .",
    "the dc conductivity in this phase was shown in @xcite to take the temperature - independent value @xmath53 the ac conductivity was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "its real part interpolates between the dc value at zero frequency and unity at high frequency with a minimum at intermediate frequencies whose depth and location depends on @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the imaginary part has a peak at low frequencies then goes to zero as the frequency goes to zero .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that this behaviour is well - described by a slight modification of the drude form when @xmath34 is small but not when @xmath34 is large .",

    "we demonstrated that the optical conductivity in a broken phase could often be described by a two - fluid model with a normal drude component and a zero - frequency superfluid pole . in some cases , however , the normal component was non - drude , which was attributed to the lack of an isolated purely - dissipative qnm",
    ". it would be useful to study more points in the phase diagram , particularly in the axion - dilaton model , in order to obtain a complete picture .",
    "there are many similarities between our results and those found in other models , including the two - fluid model behavior at small frequencies , the rapid growth of the relaxation time as we lower the temperature , the pseudo gap in the broken metallic phase at low temperatures and the missing spectral weight manifested in the fgt sum rule .",
    "however , some differences are apparent . for example , whilst @xmath55 in the axion model decreases initially , we found that it increases for large enough values of @xmath34 , thus extending the results of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the relaxation time in the broken metallic phase is not monotonic with the temperature , as opposed to the result presented in @xcite",
    ". also , unlike the inhomogeneous cases of @xcite and @xcite , we did not observe any resonances in the conductivity .",
    "as explained in @xcite , such resonances are due to coupling of the current perturbations to the sound mode in the stress tensor correlators . in our homogeneous setups , however , we consider spatially - independent perturbations that decouple from the sound mode , accounting for the absence of resonances in this case",
    ". it would be interesting to study the optical conductivity at finite momentum .",
    "next we discuss the interpretation of @xmath5 and @xmath3 appearing in . in @xcite ,",
    "these parameters were identified with the density of the normal and superfluid components of the fluid , respectively . with this in mind , it is interesting to ask whether the system is fully condensed at zero temperature .",

    "this suggests that a normal component remains at zero temperature .",
    "furthermore , we observe that a greater normal component remains for larger @xmath34 .",
    "however , whilst this identification is tempting to make , one must be careful that the normalization of the superfluid density is correct .",
    "furthermore , the connection with the quantity that appeared as the superfluid density in the model of a holographic superfluid with finite supercurrent density in @xcite is not clear .",
    "we expect that one must compute the optical conductivity in that model in order to resolve this issue .",
    "if the normalization and interpretation can indeed be fixed , then the axion - dilaton models studied here may provide a laboratory with sufficiently many parameters available in order to test ` homes ' law  a universal relation between the superfluid density at zero temperature and the dc conductivity in the normal phase at the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "this relation was first considered in a holographic context by @xcite .",
    "we leave these interesting open questions for further work .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the generalizations that could be considered in the future . we have chosen two examples from a general family of bulk actions with neutral sector @xmath148",

    ", it would be interesting to explore the superconducting phase transition in the model studied in @xcite in which the normal phase at low temperatures is governed by a novel non - trivial fixed point in the ir . in that model one could also study the effect on the broken phase when the normal phase is taken through a metal - insulator transition",
    ". moreover , alternative boundary conditions for the charged scalar could lead to additional effects , such as those described in @xcite .",
    "it would also be interesting to work directly with a more general model in order to understand which features are independent of the details of the model .",

    "<S> momentum relaxation can be built into many holographic models without sacrificing homogeneity of the bulk solution . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study two such models : one in which translational invariance is broken in the dual theory by spatially - dependent sources for massless scalar fields and another that features an additional neutral scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we turn on a charged scalar field in order to explore the condensation of a charged scalar operator in the dual theories . after demonstrating that the relaxed superconductors we construct are thermodynamically relevant , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the finite dc electrical conductivity of the normal phase is replaced by a superfluid pole in the broken phase . moreover , when the normal phase possesses a drude behaviour at low frequencies , the optical conductivity of the broken phase at low frequencies can be described by a two - fluid model that is a sum of a drude peak and a superfluid pole , as was found recently for inhomogeneous holographic superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we also study cases in which this low - frequency behavior does not hold . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the drude description is accurate when the retarded current - current correlator has a purely - dissipative pole that is well - separated from the rest of the excitations . </S>"
