    "<S> while the jrm has been originally conceived as a parametric converter and afterwards employed @xcite as a tool to generate a chemical potential for photons , we suggest to use it as a nonlinear element that controls a time - dependent coupling between a transmission line and a qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the jrm is to produce an analogue of the parametric down conversion , such that one of the modes becomes classical and can be driven periodically by an external classical current . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the system in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this allows us to demonstrate the quantum chopper as a tool for pulse shaping of individual photons .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that for weakly coherent incident pulses a time - periodic modulation of the coupling between photons and the cavity causes considerable modifications to envelopes of the scattered photons . in some driving protocols </S>",

    "<S> we also find a significant effect of the modulation on the photon s statistics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for reflected photons on resonance we observe alternating patterns of bunching and antibunching which periodically change in time  this contrasts with the purely antibunching behavior in the case of constant coupling .    _ </S>",
    "<S> setup. _ we propose a scheme for realizing quantum optical chopping ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scheme ] ) consisting of a transmission line with linear dispersion of propagating microwave photons , a parametric coupler , and a transmon qubit . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , @xmath19 becomes classical and fixed to the value @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the mode @xmath32 coincides with the flux variable of the qubit , which is characterized by the josephson ( @xmath33 ) and capacitive ( @xmath34 ) energies . in the transmon limit @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> , the qubit is represented by a nonlinear single - mode cavity in terms of the cavity operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with a cavity frequency @xmath38 and a kerr nonlinearity @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mode @xmath17 coincides with the flux variable of the transmission line in its middle . quantizing the transmission line </S>",

    "<S> here we elaborate on the floquet scattering formalism , particularly adapting it to problems of multi - particle scattering of microwave photons in transmission lines interacting with nonlinear cavities . </S>",

    "<S> let us briefly review the basic ideas of scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that at time @xmath65 we inject @xmath62 photons into the transmission line , while the cavity is empty . in the second quantization , this incoming state is given by @xmath66 , where the vacuum state @xmath67 of the transmission line is defined by @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the photon number state of the cavity , @xmath70 . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the energy - dependent @xmath79 matrix containing all the information about scattering off the cavity . a systematic way of computing @xmath80 has been developed in @xcite for scatterers with an arbitrary level structure and transition matrix elements .    </S>",
    "<S> for a time - periodic interaction , @xmath57 , elements of the @xmath81 matrix are modified  @xcite to @xmath82 , where now the energy of an incoming state is conserved modulo an integer number of the drive frequency quanta . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62-photon @xmath79 matrix bears an additional integer - valued floquet index @xmath83 , and its elements are found from the equation @xmath84_{q'q}^{n ' n } v_{qp}^{nm } \\label{tvv}\\ ] ] for the operator @xmath85 , which is defined in the floquet - extended hilbert space , by setting @xmath86 . in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> 1 ) `` on - off '' @xmath121 ; and 2 ) `` sign change '' @xmath122 . in the `` on - off '' protocol the coupling strength is periodically quenched to zero [ fig .  [ fig : g1](a ) ] , while in the `` sign change '' protocol , the sign of @xmath123 changes after crossing zero [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g1](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the major difference between the two protocols is that the former yields a @xmath124-periodic modulation of a field s amplitude [ fig .  [ fig : g1](b ) ] , while the latter yields a @xmath125-periodic one [ fig .  </S>",

    "<S> should the adiabaticity condition @xmath132 be fulfilled at every time @xmath133 for a time periodic interaction , we would expect the reflection amplitude @xmath134 to follow @xmath135 instantaneously , also showing ( almost ) full reflection in the resonant case ( the small fraction @xmath136 of the transmitted photon s probability density can be obtained from the first adiabatic correction ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the adiabaticity condition is strongly violated for the two protocols . moreover , at certain time instants the coupling strength in both of them is quenched , implying a momentary decoupling of microwave photons from the cavity and hence full transmission at these time instants . </S>",
    "<S> since we are dealing with an open quantum system , this qualitative picture becomes even more complicated due to memory effects , and the non - adiabatic behavior can be explained as a sum over histories . </S>",
    "<S> each history has the photon entering the cavity at some initial time , @xmath137 , and leaving at some later time , @xmath138 , with an amplitude @xmath139 , and a weight determined by the decay probability of the photonic state in the cavity , @xmath140 . the reflection coefficient at @xmath138 , given by the sum over initial times @xmath137 , is highly influenced by the evolution within a memory window set by the decay rate of the cavity .    </S>",
    "<S> in the `` on - off '' protocol the memory window is largest for final times after the @xmath141 node , meaning that the photon remains longer in the cavity and is released shortly after when the coupling strength is sufficiently increased , producing a spike in the reflection coefficient that overshoots unity [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g1](b ) ] . in </S>",
    "<S> the `` sign change '' protocol memory effects create an additional node , that is absent in @xmath123 , close to @xmath142 for slow drive and moving towards @xmath143 for faster drives [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g1](d ) ] . for times shortly after the @xmath144 node of @xmath123 the memory window includes histories with amplitudes of opposite signs , and their competition creates this additional node . </S>",
    "<S> all this shows how different protocols not only chop the wavepacket of the incoming photon , but also significantly alter its form .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting envelopes strongly depend on the normalized frequency @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the zeroth harmonic of @xmath147 . for the fast drive @xmath148 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath149 in the `` on - off '' protocol , which means that the reflected pulse follows @xmath150 , not @xmath151 ; and @xmath152 following @xmath153 in the `` sign change '' protocol . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath154 is negligibly small , so that we have ( almost ) full transmission despite the resonance  this effect is in sharp contrast to its non - driven counterpart . for the slow drive @xmath155 </S>",
    "<S> , the adiabaticity condition is fulfilled at least within some range around @xmath156 , and this accounts for the formation of the plateau @xmath157 , resembling full reflection in the non - driven resonant case .    the second order coherences manifest nonlinear effects quantified by the value of @xmath158 . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , the `` sign change '' protocol induces huge bunching effects due to the additional node in the single - photon reflection , as can be clearly seen in fig .  [ fig : g2](a ) . </S>",

    "<S> summary. _ we have proposed the quantum analogue of an optical chopper , operating at a few - photon level and realizable by a time - periodic modulation of the light - matter coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed an exact floquet scattering approach based on diagrammatic scattering theory and applied it to quantitatively describe scattering of microwave photons from the transmon qubit in two driving protocols of the coupling : `` on - off '' and `` sign change '' . in both of them </S>",
    "<S> we have observed interesting non - adiabatic memory effects arising due to the driving . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the `` on - off '' protocol produces periodic compressions of the photon s wavepacket , while the `` sign change '' protocol gives rise to the additional nodes in the envelope at which the field is completely quenched . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in both cases the optical chopping is realized at the quantum single - photon level . </S>",
