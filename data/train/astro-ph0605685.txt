    "the space experiment  will provide us with stellar oscillation data ( frequencies , amplitudes , line widths ) for stars of various masses and chemical compositions  mainly main sequence solar type stars and @xmath0 scuti stars  with an expected accuracy on the frequencies of @xmath1hz @xcite .",
    "such an accuracy is needed for the determination of the position of the external convection zone in solar type stars or the extent of the convective core of intermediate mass stars @xcite as well as for the inversion of the stellar density profile @xcite and of the rotation profile or for the separation of multiplets .",
    "however , studies in helioseismology have taught us that in order to probe fine details of the solar internal structure , we need both the constraints of high quality seismic data and very accurate solar models @xcite .",
    "therefore , to be able to draw valuable information from the future  data , we have to ensure now that we will be able to interpret them with models having reached the required level of accuracy .    within the  seismology working group ,",
    "the esta group has been set up , with the aim to extensively test , compare and optimise the numerical tools used to calculate stellar models and their oscillation frequencies .",
    "our goals are ( i ) to be able to produce theoretical seismic predictions by means of different numerical codes and to understand the possible differences between them and ( ii ) to bring stellar models at the level of accuracy required to interpret the future  seismic data .    up to now",
    ", the esta group has focused on specific tasks .",
    "the first one  task  1  has consisted in comparing stellar models and evolution sequences produced by seven participating evolution codes , presented in section  [ sec : tools ] . in this context",
    "we have calculated models for several specific study cases , presented in section  [ sec : task1 ] , corresponding to stars covering the range of masses , evolution stages , and chemical compositions expected for the bulk of  target stars .",
    "the main comparisons made for task  1 are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : task1-results ] . the second ",

    "the major source of the differences is the use , or not , of richardson extrapolation , but different codes react differently to the mesh as some are second order schemes while other used fourth order integration schemes ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a further step on the analysis on the sensitivity of the codes to the mesh of the models and the treatment of the boundary conditions is in progress @xcite .",

    "the comparisons undertaken under task  1 have shown that stellar models calculated by seven different codes are to first order consistent .",
    "differences in the global parameters and in the internal hydrogen abundance and sound - speed profiles are generally in the range 1 - 10 percents except for the age and the extent of the convective core that may differ by 30% or more .    for codes that have followed",
    "precisely the reference set of physics defined for the exercise , the agreement is much better with differences of the order of 1 percent or less , which gives us confidence for future modelling of  targets by these codes .",
    "nevertheless , even if the reference set of physics is fixed , differences in the models remain due to different implementations of physics in the codes , different ways of interpolating in the tables , different choices of input parameters ( isotopic ratios , atomic masses ) , etc . in a detailed comparison of the  and  codes ,",
    "@xcite have tried to identify these remaining inconsistencies showing that it should be possible to limit the differences to the order of 0.5% or less .",
    "concerning the global parameters , the source of the sometimes still large differences in age have to be examined which will imply the adoption of a common definition for the age zero . concerning the seismic parameters , the differences in the total radius and in the structure of the surface layers are responsible for the main differences in the frequencies , thus requiring a more detailed comparison of these zones",
    ".    task  2 must be further developed before we can assess if the seismic codes are providing precise frequencies .",
    "further work on the mesh of the model , the numeric scheme used to solve the oscillations equations and the boundary conditions implemented is in progress .",
    "a detailed evaluation of the numeric precision and of the implementation of physics in the codes will continue to be necessary as the physics is improved and the methods and assumptions in the calculation become more complex .",
    "an example is the inclusion of diffusion to calculate the evolution ",
    "how this is implemented requires a detailed study .",
    "consequently , the work initiated by esta will proceed after  flies .",
    "as long as we need to calculate new stellar models with better physics , the need for a regular consistency analysis of the codes remains ."
