    "this is in contrast to the three  dimensional case , where the density of charges in a harmonic potential is uniform and , therefore , where the eigenmodes are phononic - like waves . in the coulomb chain the non - uniformity of the density of ions combined with the long - range interaction result in excitations that are fundamentally different from the phonons in solids and lead to interesting thermodynamic properties .",

    "the ions are localized at the classical equilibrium positions @xmath17 , that satisfy the equations @xmath18 , and such that the potential energy is minimal .",

    "the stability of these points with respect to the transverse vibrations depends on the number of ions @xmath1 and on the ratio @xmath24 , and it is discussed in section  [ sec : tr ] . in this section , we assume that the configuration is stable and approximate the potential by its second order taylor expansion around the points @xmath17 .",

    "the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath33 and describe a system of coupled oscillators , with long range interaction and position - dependent coupling strength . in this paper eigenmodes will be calculated . for this",
    "we assume @xmath34 . to simplify notations",
    "we replace @xmath35 by @xmath36 .",
    "this results in equations for the eigenmodes of frequency @xmath37 that are similar to ( [ eq : ax ] ) , but with @xmath38 replaced by @xmath39 .",
    "the same replacement will be performed for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "clearly , the center - of - mass mode , which we denote by @xmath53 , is an even mode characterized by equal displacements at the positions @xmath54 of the chain .",
    "this property and the orthogonality between the normal modes lead to the relation @xmath55 for all normal modes with @xmath56 .",
    "it is remarkable that also the lowest axial odd mode ( stretch mode ) and its frequency can be exactly determined .",
    "in fact , taking @xmath57 and substituting into ( [ eq : ax ] ) one finds @xmath58 where we have used relation  ( [ eq : discrete ] ) .",

    "we remark that the invariance under reflection imposes different boundary conditions than the ones that are usually chosen for a crystal with uniform ion distribution . in a crystal that is translationally invariant even and odd modes are degenerate and one may choose periodic boundary conditions  @xcite . in presence of an external potential with central symmetry this invariance",
