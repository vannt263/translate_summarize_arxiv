    "the kek - to - kamioka ( k2k ) long baseline neutrino experiment @xcite is designed to explore , with laboratory neutrinos , the mechanism of @xmath7 disappearance indicated by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite , macro @xcite , and soudan  2 @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "such mechanism appears to be dominated by @xmath0 oscillations @xcite with mass - mixing parameters @xmath8 close to @xmath9 .",
    "the pathlength @xmath10 and typical energies ( @xmath11 ) of k2k @xmath7 s are well suited to study @xmath7 disappearance effects for such parameter values @xcite .    the recent data released by the k2k experiment @xcite ( 44 observed neutrino events _ vs _ 63.9 expected ) are already inconsistent with the no - oscillation hypothesis at about 97% c.l.@xcite , and suggest disappearance of the muon neutrino flavor in the path from kek to kamioka .",
    "the k2k collaboration is being understandably rather conservative on the oscillation explanation of the data , pending more accurate estimates of the k2k neutrino spectrum and interaction uncertainties by means of the near detector @xcite .",
    "however , it is tempting to use just the minimum amount of spectrum - integrated data ( i.e. , the total event rate , for which the error estimate appears to be relatively stable ) , in order to study the compatibility of k2k and sk data @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to investigate such a compatibility issue , by comparing predictions and data in both k2k and sk , within the simplest ( two - family ) @xmath0 oscillation framework .",
    "we show that the k2k and the sk data are consistent , and that their combination starts to be useful in constraining further the oscillation parameters . in particular , the 99% c.l .",
    "range for @xmath2 allowed by sk only , @xmath3\\times10^{-3}$ ] ev@xmath4 , is reduced to @xmath5\\times 10^{-3}$ ] ev@xmath4 by including k2k data .",
    "finally we show that , by halving the k2k total rate error , the @xmath2 range would be ulteriorly reduced to @xmath6\\times10^{-3}$ ] ev@xmath4 .",
    "analyses of k2k data have to consider the energy spectrum of parent neutrinos at the far detector @xmath12 , i.e. , the spectrum of neutrino that have produced a detected interaction at the kamioka site .",
    "such spectrum is , in general , given by the product of the unoscillated neutrino energy spectrum @xmath13 at the far ( sk ) detector , times the interaction cross section @xmath14 , times the detection efficiency @xmath15 ( all in differential form ) , integrated over all the final state parameters ( simbolically , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the spectrum @xmath12 is important since , in the presence of neutrino mass and mixing , the oscillated event rate can be expressed as @xmath17 [ to be compared with the unoscillated rate , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath7 survival probability .    at present",
    ", there is enough public information on @xmath13 @xcite , but not yet on the product @xmath20 relevant for the far detector specifications .",
    "therefore , a direct and accurate reconstruction of the spectrum @xmath12 and of its uncertainties is not possible outside the k2k collaboration , at least at present .",
    "however , an indirect , approximate reconstruction can be made , by considering that : ( a ) the neutrino spectrum is practically zero above 5 gev @xcite ; and ( b ) according to the k2k montecarlo ( mc ) simulation , for the current exposure ( @xmath21 p.o.t . )",
    "one has @xmath22 events , while @xmath23 , 27.4 , and 23.1 events for @xmath24 , 5 , and @xmath25 ev@xmath4 , respectively , assuming maximal mixing @xcite .",
    "we have then introduced an empirical functional form for the spectrum , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , which is found to reproduce well the above mc results for @xmath28 . in the following analysis",
    "we use such interacted neutrino spectrum , since it gives  by construction  results close to the k2k mc simulation , after integration over @xmath29 .",
    "a more accurate ( and less tentative ) parametrization of @xmath12 shall be possible after the experimental specifications and selection cuts ( relevant to determine @xmath30 and its uncertainties ) will be measured and described in detail .    concerning the uncertainties , the current systematic error on the total rate",
    "is estimated to be 10% by the k2k collaboration @xcite .",
    "spectral bins may be affected by larger ( and correlated ) errors @xcite , which , however , do not affect our spectrum - averaged analysis .",
    "therefore , we attach a @xmath31 fractional error to the oscillated number of events @xmath32 , while the statistical ( poisson ) error @xmath33 is attached to the number of observed events , @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 statistics for k2k is then simply given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "with such definition , the no oscillation hypothesis ( @xmath38 ) is disfavored at 97% c.l .",
    "( @xmath39 for @xmath40 ) , consistently with the current claim of the k2k collaboration @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows the number @xmath41 of k2k events for the current exposure ( @xmath42 p.o.t . ) , as a function of @xmath2 , for maximal mixing @xmath43 . the solid curve , corresponding to our calculation of @xmath44 , starts from @xmath45 events in the no - oscillation limit ( @xmath46 ) , and tends to the asymptotic value of 63.9/2 in the fast oscillation limit ( @xmath47 ) , after a few `` wiggles '' associated to the first oscillation cycles .",
    "the curve is very close to the four k2k mc points used to benchmark our calculation .",
    "the horizontal gray band represents the @xmath48 interval for the total number of observed events in k2k .",
    "the allowed band disfavors no oscillations at @xmath49 , and the first deep oscillation minimum at @xmath50 .",
    "it is instead in very good agreement with the oscillated predictions for @xmath51 ev@xmath4 , the best fit being reached at @xmath52 ev@xmath4 .",
    "such a value is very close to the one independently quoted by the sk collaboration as the current best fit to their atmospheric neutrino data ( @xmath53 ev@xmath4 ) @xcite , under the same @xmath0 oscillation hypothesis .",
    "ev@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "] therefore , it makes sense to combine k2k and sk data , as we do in the following section .",
    "given the very good agreement between the k2k and sk allowed ranges for @xmath2 at maximal mixing , it is interesting to study their compatibility for unconstrained @xmath54 mixing . concerning the sk atmospheric @xmath54 analysis , we make use of the results recently reported by us in @xcite ( for 79.5 kty sk data ) , specialized to the simplest scenario of pure @xmath0 oscillations . to draw iso-@xmath55 contours , while we used @xmath56 for the more general @xmath57 and @xmath58 cases considered in @xcite .",
    "]    figure  2 shows the regions allowed at 90% and 99% c.l .   by sk , k2k , and their combination , in the @xmath54 mass - mixing plane @xmath8 .",
    "the upper left panel corresponds to sk atmospheric data only , for which we find two degenerate best - fit points ( stars ) at @xmath59 ev@xmath4 and at octant - symmetric mixing values , @xmath60 , corresponding to slightly nonmaximal oscillation amplitude , @xmath61 .    the upper right panel in fig .",
    "2 shows the fit to k2k only . the locus of best - fit points is a continuous , octant - symmetric curve ( not shown ) passing through @xmath62 .",
    "the k2k constraints in the mass - mixing plane are weaker than those placed by sk , especially on @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , one can not expect a significant improvement on @xmath63 limits from the sk+k2k combination .",
    "concerning @xmath2 , the no - oscillation limit @xmath64 is still allowed at 99% c.l . , while values around @xmath65 ev@xmath4 are excluded ( for large mixing ) .",
    "such values correspond to the first ( deep ) oscillation minimum in fig .  1 , which is disfavored by the data at @xmath50 , as previously noted .",
    "therefore , in the sk+k2k combination , we expect `` high '' values of @xmath2 to be more disfavored than `` low '' values .    the lower left panel in fig .",
    "2 shows the combination of sk and k2k data .",
    "the best - fit points are located at the same values of @xmath63 as for sk alone and , in general , the bounds on @xmath63 are not significantly modified , as expected . the best - fit value of @xmath2 is only slightly lowered ( @xmath66 ev@xmath4 ) but , most importantly , the 90% and 99% c.l",
    ".  ranges of @xmath2 are appreciably reduced both from below and ( more strongly ) from above .",
    "such results show that the k2k experiment is already having a nonnegligible impact in the determination of the neutrino squared mass difference @xmath2 relevant for the @xmath0 channel and for the leading oscillations in ( very ) long baseline experiments .    the lower right panel in fig .",
    "2 shows a prospective sk+k2k combination , with the same sk data and k2k data but with k2k total uncertainty hypothetically reduced by a factor of two .",
    "the @xmath2 range is significantly narrowed , while the @xmath63 range is still basically unchanged . in summary ,",
    "the various panels of fig .  2 demonstrate that k2k data are relevant for the determination of @xmath2 , rather than of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to discuss in more detail the results of fig .  2 in terms of @xmath2 only , with @xmath63 unconstrained .",
    "figure  3 shows the results of such an exercise , in terms of the function @xmath67 .",
    "the 90% and 99% c.l .",
    "ranges for @xmath2 ( @xmath68 ) are explicitly shown for the sk and sk+k2k fits .",
    "numerically , we find that the 99% c.l .  range for @xmath2 allowed by sk only , @xmath3\\times10^{-3}$ ] ev@xmath4 , is reduced to @xmath5\\times 10^{-3}$ ] ev@xmath4 by including k2k data . by halving the uncertainties of the k2k total rate , the @xmath2 range would be ulteriorly reduced to @xmath6\\times10^{-3}$ ] ev@xmath4 ( 99% c.l . ) .",
    "the reduction of the minimum values of @xmath2 in fig .  3 ( at a given c.l . ) is relevant for future ( very ) long baseline experiments .",
    "for instance , in the opera experiment @xcite downstream the cern - to - gran sasso neutrino beam , the @xmath69 appearance rate is approximately proportional to @xmath70 @xcite ; therefore , the increase of @xmath71 from @xmath72 ev@xmath4 ( sk ) to @xmath73 ev@xmath4 ( sk+k2k ) at 99% c.l",
    ".  implies an increase of the minimum expected @xmath69 event rate by a factor @xmath74 ( at the same c.l . ) ; the increase would be as high as a factor @xmath75 for the case with halved k2k errors ( @xmath76 ev@xmath4 ) .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath2 allowed range is also important to refine the energy or baseline optimization in future neutrino factory experiments , where the current @xmath2 uncertainty plays an important role ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "finally , the increase of @xmath71 strengthens the accuracy of approximations based on the hierarchy of squared mass differences , which have long been used in global solar+terrestrial neutrino analyses ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a final remark is in order .",
    "our current analysis is based on initial k2k data and on an approximate description of the k2k detector specification .",
    "therefore , it can not be a substitute of the ( joint ) official oscillation analysis that will be performed by the k2k ( sk+k2k ) collaboration(s ) .",
    "however , we think that our results , although necessarily approximate , are sufficiently indicative of the k2k potential in improving our current knowledge of @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "we have shown that , within the simplest ( two - family ) @xmath0 oscillation scenario , the initial evidence for a @xmath7 flux suppression in k2k is perfectly consistent with the atmospheric @xmath7 flux anomaly .",
    "the range of the neutrino squared mass difference indicated by the sk atmospheric @xmath77 experiment is reduced by including the k2k data .",
    "as a consequence , k2k starts to be important in narrowing the range of predictions for future ( very ) long baseline experiment .",
