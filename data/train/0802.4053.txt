    "this paper is the third in a series investigating the use of `` counter - propagating wave methods '' ( cpwms)@xcite for solving the  equation exactly .",
    "cpwms are a particular variant of the more general multipolar decomposition methods , wherein the wavefunction @xmath1 is decomposed into two or more components , @xmath4 .",
    "thus , for a two - term , or `` bipolar '' decomposition , @xmath0 .",
    "this rather trivial - seeming procedure can be quite advantageous in the context of quantum trajectory methods ( qtms),@xcite i.e. trajectory - based numerical techniques for performing exact quantum dynamics calculations , based on bohmian mechanics.@xcite conventional qtms use a single - term or `` unipolar '' representation of the wavefunction from which all other quantities , such as the quantum trajectories themselves , are uniquely determined .",
    "multipolar decomposition , on the other hand , can lead to radically different qtm behavior for the individual @xmath4 components , owing to the fact that the bohmian equations of motion are non - linear.@xcite    as applied to wavepacket dynamics for reactive scattering systems , qtms suffer from a significant and well - known numerical drawback , which to date , precludes a completely robust application of these methods .",
    "namely , qtms are numerically unstable in the vicinity of amplitude nodes and `` quasi - nodes '' ( i.e. rapid oscillations),@xcite owing to singularities in the `` quantum potential , '' @xmath5 , which together with the classical potential , @xmath6 , determines the quantum trajectories . in the reactive scattering context , such behavior",
    "is always observed , due to interference between the incident and reflected waves . on the other hand ,",
    "if the latter two contributions to the total @xmath1 were somehow separated , and associated with two different interference - free @xmath4 components , the node problem might well be circumvented .",
    "if , in addition , the @xmath4 component field functions were smooth and slowly - varying , far fewer qtm trajectories and time - steps might be required than for @xmath1 itself  although the latter could be reconstructed at any desired time simply via linear superposition of the components .",
    "these numerical advantages thus provide significant motivation for consideration of the bipolar approach .",
    "a much more detailed discussion may be found in the first two articles of this series , paper  i ( ref .  ) and paper  ii ( ref .  ) .",
    "the most obvious aspect of any bipolar decomposition , including those restricted along the lines of the preceding paragraph,@xcite is that it is not unique .",
    "the covering function method,@xcite for instance , treats @xmath1 as the difference between two very large - amplitude components , thus `` diluting '' the effects of interference .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) cpwm approach,@xcite on the other hand , regards the bipolar decomposition = _ + +",
    "_ - [ psitot ] as a superposition of right- and left - traveling counter - propagating waves , @xmath7 . for stationary states at least",
    ", the decomposition is defined such that the @xmath7 components correspond to semiclassical wkb approximations , @xmath8 , in the large - action limit .",
    "in addition to providing pedagogical value ( semiclassical and bohmian mechanics can not be so reconciled in a unipolar context ) , the semiclassical field functions are typically smooth and slowly - varying , i.e. the semiclassical - like cpwm components @xmath7 provide the desirable numerical advantages described in the preceding paragraph .    in paper",
    "i ( ref .  ) , a _",
    "unique _ cpwm bipolar decomposition was determined for bound stationary eigenstates of arbitrary 1d hamiltonians .",
    "the resultant @xmath7 field functions are smooth and interference - free , and approach the wkb approximations in the large - action limit ( within the classically allowed region of space ) as desired .",
    "moreover , the quantum potentials @xmath9 become vanishingly small in this limit , so that the bipolar quantum trajectories approach classical trajectories , and only a small number are required for a numerical propagation , regardless of excitation energy , @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the unipolar @xmath1 exhibits _ motionless _ trajectories , and an arbitrarily increasing number of nodes in the large - action / energy limit .",
    "results were presented for both the harmonic and morse oscillator potentials .    in paper",
    "ii ( ref .  ) , the 1d cpwm ideas were modified somewhat for stationary scattering states of discontinuous potentials .",
    "although the cpwm decomposition of paper  i is uniquely specified for any arbitrary 1d eigenstate  bound or scattering  and in the bound case , always satisfies the correspondence principle , the non-@xmath11 nature of the scattering states is such that the paper  i decomposition generally does _ not _ satisfy correspondence globally . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] , this requires that global modifications must be made in order to enable a correspondence between @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "these are such as to lead to substantial differences between the density _ functions _ @xmath12 and @xmath13 , although the _ trajectories _ are identical .",
    "moreover , the resultant @xmath7 are found to correspond to the familiar `` incident , '' `` transmitted , '' and `` reflected '' waves of traditional scattering theory@xcite in the appropriate asymptotic limits . from the time - dependent standpoint ,",
    "reflection was found to be due to trajectory _ hopping _ from one cpwm component to the other , as can be naturally understood using a simple ray optics analogy .",
    "the method was applied to several elementary discontinuous potential systems , including the square barrier / well .    in the present paper ( paper  iii ) , the ref .",
    "formulations are generalized to incorporate both continuous _ and _ discontinuous potential systems . once again",
    ", an analogy is drawn from semiclassical mechanics , albeit a `` sophisticated '' version@xcite less frequently considered ( sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] ) . as in paper  ii , a time - dependent method based on ray optics is developed for computing stationary states of any desired energy and boundary conditions .",
    "for the most part , the discussion of the preceding paragraph still applies , but some additional key points should be emphasized .",
    "first , the bipolar decomposition now provides a sensible definition of `` incident , '' `` transmitted , '' and `` reflected '' waves _ throughout all space _ , not just asymptotically .",
    "second , the explicit hopping of trajectories from one cpwm component to the other is replaced with a _ coupling term _ in the time - evolution equations .",
    "third , the trajectories become _ completely classical_. finally , an alternative methodology is also developed , based on the use of _ constant velocity trajectories _ , which can be readily applied to barrier tunneling situations .",
    "the new methods are found to be remarkably efficient , accurate , and robust across a diverse range of 1d test potentials and system energies ( sec .  [ results ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a derivation and discussion of the time - evolution equations for the cpwm bipolar components @xmath7 , both for classical and constant velocity trajectories , are presented in sec .",
    "[ theory ] and the appendices .",
    "[ numerical ] provides numerical details of the various bipolar algorithms used to compute stationary states .",
    "results are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] for four benchmark applications : eckart barrier ; square barrier ; uphill ramp ; double - gaussian barrier . for the first three ,",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "let @xmath14 be the potential energy for a 1d scattering system , and @xmath10 the energy of some stationary state @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 . in reality",
    ", @xmath15 always manifests some reflection , even though the energy is above the potential barrier .",
    "however , basic wkb theory predicts _ zero _ reflection in this case , as the classical trajectories do not turn around .",
    "this is also evident from the form of the two basic wkb counter - propagating wave solutions , ^(x ) = r_(x ) e^i s_(x)/ , [ scsoln ] where r_(x ) = s_(x ) = , [ scrs ] @xmath18 is the mass , @xmath19 is the invariant flux ( paper  i ) , and primes denote spatial differentiation . note that since scattering solutions are non - square - integrable , the choice of @xmath19 is arbitrary ; however , throughout this paper we shall adopt the usual left - incident wave normalization convention , @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 . the positive and negative momentum functions , @xmath22 , specify the classical trajectories and semiclassical lagrangian manifolds@xcite ( lms ) associated with the @xmath23 solutions",
    ". clearly , the classical trajectories do not change direction , as there are no turning points along the real @xmath17 axis . therefore , for an arbitrary linear combination solution , = _ + _ + ^+ _ - _ -^ , [ alphaeq ] the entire reflected wave must be due to the @xmath24 contribution .",
    "the boundary conditions presume that the left - traveling wave contribution vanish in the @xmath25 limit , implying that @xmath26 and @xmath27i.e .",
    ", there _ is _ no reflected wave .",
    "various strategies have been developed to deal with the above difficulty of the basic wkb method.@xcite the most common involve analytic continuation into the complex plane .",
    "specifically , if no turning point is located along the real axis , then one is found elsewhere in the complex plane .",
    "the path of the incident wave is deformed so as to give rise to a reflected wave upon encountering the complex turning point .",
    "an analysis of the stokes and anti - stokes lines@xcite that emanate from the complex turning point and cross the real @xmath17 axis , enables one to effectively recast the above procedure in terms of purely real - valued @xmath17 . the net effect ( as interpreted in this paper )",
    "is the introduction of _ coupling _ from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , resulting in an @xmath30 value that _ changes _ over @xmath17 , thus yielding meaningful semiclassical partial reflection probabilities .",
    "alternatively , there is an approach due to bremmer@xcite that from the start is formulated entirely on the real @xmath17 axis .",
    "this approach is preferred for the present purpose , as it provides a common bipolar foundation not only for basic wkb and `` sophisticated '' ( i.e. capable of predicting partial reflection ) semiclassical methods , but also for _ exact quantum _ scattering applications , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ classicaltraj ] .",
    "bremmer s idea is to model the continuous potential @xmath14 using a collection of discontinuous steps .",
    "solutions are determined for an arbitrary step size , which is then made infinitesimally small .",
    "locally , along any given step , the two `` exact ''  solutions ( for the model step potential ) are plane waves , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the ( constant ) potential value along the @xmath34th step ( appendix  a ) . a viable global solution , @xmath15 , must match boundary conditions appropriately at each of the step edges .",
    "in reality , a pure positive momentum local plane wave in one step would be joined to some linear combination of positive and negative momentum plane waves in the adjacent step , corresponding to partial reflection and transmission off of the local step .",
    "if the reflection contribution is _ ignored _ , e.g. so that only _ positive _ momentum local plane waves are involved , then the resultant approximate global solution can be easily shown to be just @xmath35 in the limit of infinitesimal step size . similarly , @xmath24 is obtained from the negative momentum local plane waves .",
    "this approximation thus leads to the uncoupled basic wkb solutions of .",
    "the above approach clearly demonstrates how `` continuous reflection''@xcite  i.e . that arising from continuous potentials  may be interpreted in more familiar discontinuous terms .",
    "it also suggests that _ reflection requires coupling between positive and negative momentum wavefunction components_. this approach has been used to develop a sophisticated wkb approximation , similar to the stokes / anti - stokes approach described above , wherein one - way reflection from @xmath36 to @xmath37 is retained , but back reflection is ignored.@xcite on the other hand , if _ all _ reflection is retained , one can derive a coupled pair of first order differential equations for @xmath7 that _ exactly _ describes the quantum scattering solution @xmath1 of .",
    "although the @xmath7 components are not themselves stationary solutions , they do correspond to the familiar incident / transmitted / reflected interpretations as discussed in paper  ii .        in paper  ii ,",
    "an exact quantum , cpwm bipolar decomposition scheme for stationary scattering states was presented such that a suitable @xmath7 could be constructed for a solution @xmath1 with any desired boundary conditions , using a simple time - dependent approach .",
    "the classical trajectories and lms were found to be identical to those of the basic wkb approximations , @xmath23thus satisfying the correspondence principle , and giving rise to smooth , well - behaved , interference - free cpwm component functions , @xmath7 .",
    "although the method formally applies only to discontinuous potentials , sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] suggests that it ought to be extendible to continuous potentials as well , simply by modeling the latter using infinitesimally small steps .",
    "this idea is indeed quite straightforward to implement , as discussed in appendix  a and fig .",
    "[ derivefig ] . as in paper  ii",
    ", the result is a trajectory - based scattering methodology that is both _",
    "local _ and _ exact _ in its treatment of reflection and transmission , due to the time - dependent nature of the approach .",
    "in contrast , the global character of reflection and transmission in conventional time - independent exact quantum methods is well - recognized . of the time - independent semiclassical approximations ,",
    "the most sophisticated depend on the relative placement of local potential features such as discontinuities and turning points,@xcite although the more approximate methods treat such features independently .",

    "continuous potential reflection is thus described in more pedagogical discontinuous terms . ]    from appendix  a , the hydrodynamic ( lagrangian ) time - evolution equations for the cpwm bipolar components are found to be = , [ pdotgwf ] where @xmath38 are the momenta , which define the @xmath7 lm and trajectories .",
    "note that as expected , these are identical to those of @xmath23 , i.e. _ the trajectories are completely classical _ even though the solutions are exactly quantum mechanical ( appendix  b ) .",
    "all of the other desirable properties , as described in the preceding paragraph and in paper  ii , are also found to be true .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare with the usual unipolar evolution equations of bohmian mechanics.@xcite both are exact qtms , but quantum effects are incorporated in very different ways . in unipolar bohmian mechanics ,",
    "the trajectory evolution is determined by the modified potential @xmath39 , where the quantum potential correction @xmath5 is responsible for all quantum effects .",
    "evaluation of @xmath5 requires explicit double spatial differentiation of the wavefunction @xmath1 , which in turn requires specialized numerical techniques ( sec .",
    "[ lowlevel ] ) . also , @xmath5 diverges at nodes , and is otherwise numerically unstable in the presence of interference .",
    "in contrast , the present bipolar qtm scheme avoids interference difficulties as desired , owing to the semiclassical correspondence .",
    "quantum effects do _ not _ manifest in the trajectories themselves ( as these evolve completely classically ) , and there _ is _ no quantum potential in .",
    "so where do quantum effects come from in ? as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] , these must be due to inter - component coupling , i.e. the last term in the equation . note that the amount of coupling is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the coupling vanishes in the limit that @xmath41 which is reasonable , considering that this is also the usual wkb condition and that the basic wkb solutions are uncoupled .",
    "note that _ no _ wavefunction spatial derivatives are required in a decided advantage over the unipolar approach . in principle , every trajectory `` splits '' into a forward and backward moving trajectory pair at every point in space and time ( paper  ii ) .",
    "the forward - moving trajectory remains on the same lm as the source , whereas the backward trajectory `` hops '' onto the other lm .",
    "however , unlike the situation in paper  ii , this splitting , hopping , and subsequent recombining need not be considered explicitly , as it is all implicitly dealt with at the differential equation level .",
    "nevertheless , conceptually , one may regard trajectory hopping as the _ source _ of coupling and quantum effects .",
    "note that for scattering systems , @xmath42 in the asymptotic limits of @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that there is no asymptotic coupling ( or trajectory hopping ) between the two @xmath7 components  an essential feature from the perspective of computing scattering quantities such as global reflection and transmission probabilities ( which according to normalization and boundary conventions discussed in sec .",
    "[ semiclassical ] , are obtained respectively via @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ pdotgwf ] ) also ensures that the asymptotic @xmath45 solutions are the desired _",
    "plane waves _ , and not some arbitrary linear superposition such as a sine wave . note that in this regard , the hydrodynamic time - derivative aspect of is _ essential _",
    ", e.g. the ordinary  equation would not preclude asymptotic sine wave solutions .    although @xmath7 and @xmath23 are identical in the asymptotic limits ( apart from the constant scaling factor @xmath46 ) , they differ in the interaction region [ i.e. @xmath47 depends on @xmath17 in this region ] , even though the trajectories and lms are the same throughout .",
    "this raises some interesting questions vis - a - vis the interpretation of standard bohmian quantities in a coupled bipolar context , which will be explored more fully in sec .",
    "[ additional ] . here , we consider the bipolar quantum potential , which in the conventional sense would be obtained via @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 real .",
    "but , it is not clear that such a definition should apply in the case where the @xmath7 are coupled and do not individually evolve according to the  equation . indeed , such a definition would be inconsistent with the time evolution of @xmath52 , which in any event is itself inconsistent with the classical trajectory evolution ( @xmath53 ) . in this context , it is perhaps more natural to define @xmath9 such that @xmath54 determines the trajectory evolution .",
    "according to this definition , @xmath55 for the present bipolar cpwm formulation , even throughout the interaction region .",
    "as in paper  ii , the desired stationary state solution , as obtained from the evolution equations , is not observed at all times , but only asymptotically in the large @xmath56 limit .",
    "the same ray optics and continuous wave cavity ring - down interpretations that apply in paper  ii also apply here .",
    "thus , at @xmath57 , one starts with a left - incident asymptotic plane wave truncated outside the interaction region .",
    "it can be shown ( paper  ii , appendix  b ) that as @xmath58 , within any finite @xmath17 interval that includes the interaction potential , the resultant @xmath59 converges exponentially quickly to the correct time - dependent stationary state solution with appropriate @xmath17 boundary conditions .",
    "a proof is provided in appendix  b , which , for comparison with the time - dependent  equation , relies on the eulerian ( partial time derivative ) version of , i.e. =  + [ pdot ] . note that involves a single spatial derivative of the wavefunction , unlike .",
    "equation  ( [ pdot ] ) above can be employed to derive a very useful flux relationship , = - j_ , [ fluxrel ] where @xmath60 is the density , and @xmath61 is the flux , defined in terms of the actual classical trajectory velocities .",
    "taken individually , the @xmath62 do not obey continuity ( except when @xmath63 ) , implying that the total probability for each @xmath7 component is not conserved .",
    "together , however , they do satisfy a kind of continuity relation , in that @xmath64 , implying that the _ total probability for both @xmath36 and @xmath37 is conserved_. this is an important , nontrivial result  quite distinct from the usual probability conservation of @xmath1 itself . as described in fig .",

    "components for the cpwm bipolar decompositions considered in this paper .",
    "all probability that leaves the @xmath37 component must flow into the @xmath36 component .",
    "consequently , @xmath67 is conserved for all time . ]",
    "it should be stated that the classical trajectory cpwm bipolar decomposition scheme , in the form described above , is not viable for computing stationary eigenstates below the potential barrier maximum .",
    "per se _ is not the issue , since one can in principle apply in the tunneling regime using analytic continuation ( in a manner similar to that applied in paper  ii ) as has been confirmed in numerical tests .",
    "however , a difficulty arises when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , i.e. in the vicinity of the real @xmath17 axis turning points . for discontinuous potentials ,",
    "this only occurs for energies near a piece - wise barrier energy @xmath33 , manifesting as substantially increased propagation times ( paper  ii ) . for continuous potentials , all energies below the barrier height exhibit turning points along the real @xmath17 axis , and are therefore problematic .",
    "specifically , the @xmath70 terms in lead to numerical instabilities near the turning points .",
    "it should be noted that turning point / caustic issues similar to those described in sec .",
    "[ additional ] are also faced by semiclassical methods .",
    "thus , similar remedies may presumably be applied here ( e.g. complex plane path deformation ) , although these are not considered further in this paper .",
    "instead , we are guided by one of our original motivations,@xcite to develop methods that avoid such semiclassical difficulties altogether . to this end",
    ", we turn once again to the ray optics interpretation of the bipolar approach , as discussed in paper  ii .",
    "note that in classical optics , the `` ray '' interpretation of a given time - evolving electromagnetic field is not necessarily unique ; one has a certain freedom to define rays as convenient for a given application.@xcite consider the case of total internal reflection , for instance , at the boundary between two materials with different indices of refraction .",
    "quantum mechanically , this corresponds to a single - step discontinuous potential at an energy below the barrier height ( paper  ii ) . according to the usual ray interpretation , the incident rays refract to the extent that they become parallel to the interface , and",
    "therefore do not penetrate at all into the second medium .",
    "this picture is physically somewhat incorrect however , in that it does not capture the exponentially - damped evanescent wave.@xcite quantum mechanically , this corresponds to tunneling into the discontinuous step , which is simply not described using the bipolar classical trajectory method as presented in sec .",
    "[ classicaltraj ] .",
    "on the other hand , a simple , alternative ray interpretation can be applied to total internal reflection that _ does _ predict the evanescent wave correctly . according to this interpretation , _ the incident ray velocities remain _ constant _ across the interface_. these rays",
    "are reflected within the second medium , giving rise to the evanescent wave , and also providing an explanation for the goos - hnchen phenomenon.@xcite the quantum - mechanical analog would be _ constant velocity _ bipolar trajectories , for which the incident wave asymptotic velocities remain constant _ throughout _ the interaction region . presumably , the time evolution equations derived from such a choice of trajectories would not depend very sensitively on the energy @xmath10 , even in the vicinity of the barrier height , so that tunneling , and classical turning points / caustics would pose no special difficulties .      the semiclassical - like cpwm discussed in sec .  [ classicaltraj ] and",
    "the appendices does not generalize in any straightforward manner for trajectories other than classical .",
    "however , there is an alternative time - independent formulation , conceptually similar to the bremmer ( b ) approach but differing in the details , which does allow for such a generalization .",
    "this approach is due to frman and frman ( f),@xcite who use it to define generalized semiclassical approximations , although it can also be used to derive corresponding exact quantum bipolar decompositions .",
    "the guiding principle of the f approach ( as interpreted here ) is that semiclassical solutions should satisfy the invariant flux property@xcite  i.e . , the left side of with @xmath71 essentially arbitrary .",
    "if @xmath72 is chosen classically , then the usual basic wkb solutions result for @xmath23 . curiously , however , the corresponding exact quantum @xmath73 are _ not _ the same as in sec .",
    "[ classicaltraj ] . in the f case",
    ", the decomposition of is uniquely defined via the time - independent  equation and the relation thus , in comparing to , the @xmath46 coefficients behave in the derivative _ as if _ they were @xmath17-independent constants , though , in fact , they are not ( except when there is no coupling ) .",
    "although not identical , the f and b bipolar decompositions are somewhat similar in the classical trajectory case [ compare to ] , and both are plagued by similar numerical instabilities near turning points , as has been confirmed in numerical testing . however , the main advantage of the f approach is that it can be applied to arbitrary trajectories , @xmath74 . in particular , we choose _ constant velocity _",
    "trajectories obtained from the left - incident plane waves , i.e. @xmath75 [ with @xmath76 .",
    "this gives rise to exact quantum cpwm components @xmath7 that are smooth and well - behaved everywhere , even near turning points and barrier maxima .",
    "note that for constant velocity trajectories , imply that @xmath7 are linear combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath77 .      in analogy with sec .",
    "[ classicaltraj ] , the goal is to develop a time - dependent method to compute the f constant velocity cpwm bipolar decomposition in the large @xmath56 limit . however , since the f construction of the @xmath7 is radically different from that of b , a substantially different approach than that of appendix  a must be used .",
    "we have developed several different derivations , all of which yield the same final results .",
    "the simplest strategy is to `` work backwards '' through appendix  b , but using for constant velocity trajectories instead of .",
    "however , a more pedagogical approach may also be employed , as presented below .    as in",
    ", the basic idea is to presume that the coefficients @xmath46 act as constants , but with respect to _ time _",
    "derivatives rather than spatial derivatives .",
    "in particular , it seems more natural here to refer to _ total _ rather than partial time derivatives , given the trajectory - based nature of the methodology .",
    "less obvious at this stage is the fact that the linear combination @xmath78 must be used rather than @xmath79 itself , in order to be consistent with the time - independent f results .",
    "we thus obtain the condition together with the time - dependent  equation ( converted to total derivative form ) , as applied to the linear combination , above gives rise to a unique set of time - evolution equations for @xmath80 . in the constant velocity trajectory case , for which @xmath81 , these are found",
    "to be = i - i v [ pdotunigwf ] .      using a procedure analogous to that described at the start of appendix  b , one can show that for stationary states , is in fact consistent with the time - independent f constant velocity cpwm bipolar decomposition .",

    "what is not so clear , however , is whether starting with a truncated asymptotic plane wave , one necessarily approaches the stationary solution in the large @xmath56 limit ( sec .",

    "although this has not yet been proven , it is a reasonable assumption , given both the counter - propagating trajectory nature of the method and flux properties similar to the b classical trajectory case ( discussed below ) .",
    "moreover , for all of the numerical applications considered in sec .  [ results ] , exponentially fast convergence is in fact observed .",
    "the f constant velocity time - evolution equations [ ] offer some decided advantages over the classical trajectory approach .",

    "thus , one may compute reflection and transmission probabilities , @xmath92 and @xmath87 , simply by evaluating @xmath93 and @xmath94 at sufficiently large times .    from a purely numerical point of view , the above scheme offers many advantages  e.g .",

    "is also anticipated .",
    "most importantly however , since @xmath95 , there is no need to compute on - the - fly numerical spatial derivatives . with regard to parallel computation , therefore , there is no need for trajectories to communicate _ within _ a lm , although the coupling requires position - dependent communication between positive and negative lm trajectories .      in order to solve the time - evolution equations numerically ,",

    "we have found it convenient to modify the ray optics picture somewhat from the form described above and in paper  ii .",
    "first , we define an initial negative lm grid , even though @xmath37 itself is zero initially .",
    "the idea here is that unlike paper  ii , we wish to avoid explicit trajectory hopping .",
    "consequently , both sets of grid points exist for all time and evolve independently of each other ( though the component wavefunctions do interact ) .",
    "second , to avoid unnecessary computational effort , no propagation is done outside of the interaction region of interest . instead , at uniform time intervals , new @xmath36 trajectories are fed in at @xmath91 , with an initial @xmath36 value consistent with the positive momentum asymptotic plane wave solution .",
    "later , as these upper grid trajectories reach @xmath96 , they are discarded .",
    "the @xmath37 situation is similar , except that the initial @xmath97 value is set to zero , and the trajectories are discarded as they reach @xmath91 .",
    "the most substantial difference from the ray optics picture , however , is found in our implementation of the constant velocity method , for which the grids are distributed uniformly throughout the interaction region _",
    "at all times_. at the initial time , the upper and lower grids coincide .",
    "the initial @xmath36 is taken to be the asymptotic plane wave solution _ throughout _ the interaction region , and the initial @xmath37 is set to zero .",
    "the above modification , which we call the `` non - wavefront '' approach , is certainly not necessary , and is introduced simply for convenience .",
    "calculations performed both ways reveal that both converge exponentially to the correct stationary solution . however , the initial convergence of the non - wavefront calculations is faster , owing to the fact that the coupling takes effect immediately .",
    "the numerical algorithm is also easier to implement .",

    "the primary advantage of fixed - grid propagation is that the two grids remain commensurate for all time , thus avoiding the need for interpolation .",
