    "blazars are radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) viewed at small angles between the jet axis and the line of sight . due to relativistic beaming",
    ", they are the brightest and most variable high energy sources among agns . bl lacertae objects , a subclass of blazars @xcite ,",
    "are completely dominated by nonthermal emission and show only faint or no emission lines at all .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) extends over more than 15 orders of magnitude and exhibits two pronounced peaks when plotted as @xmath1 versus @xmath2 .",
    "high - peaked bl lacertae objects ( hbls ) are characterized by the first peak being located in the uv to x - ray range , whereas the second peak appears at @xmath3-ray energies ( gev to tev ) .",
    "the non - thermal , beamed emission detected from hbls is commonly ascribed to synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation from ultrarelativistic charged particles , accelerated at shocks in jets moving with relativistic bulk speed .",
    "progress in understanding the roles of shocks and plasma turbulence for particle acceleration and the interplay with the dynamics of the jet expansion is expected from modelling the sed of blazars . at present , it is unclear whether the observed emission is entirely due to accelerated electrons , as in synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , or whether the high - energy emission is due to pions produced by accelerated protons and ions and subsequent pion decay ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "owing to their strong spectral and flux variability at all wavebands down to minutes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , simultaneous multi - wavelength ( mwl ) campaigns are essential to study the sed of hbls . of paramount importance are hereby the x - ray and @xmath3-ray regimes , where the two sed peaks are located for hbls . in former mwl campaigns ,",
    "the minimum time scale of truly simultaneous observations was restricted by the low sensitivity of the participating vhe telescopes , enabling the investigation of transient events only in high flux states . with the advent of a new generation of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes with improved sensitivity and lowered energy threshold such as magic , h.e.s.s .  and veritas ,",
    "the detection of hbls in a few hours becomes feasible also during low flux states .    in this proceedings we present magic ( @xcite , @xcite ) observations of the well - known tev blazars mrk421 and mrk501 in 2006 .",
    "for individual nights , these were conducted ( quasi-)simultaneously with h.e.s.s .",
