    "the introduction of large - size nanoparticles of different shapes has emerged as the best practical way to improve the current performance of high - temperature superconductors . while in the first superconducting cables",
    "the critical currents were limited by weak links , in the second - generation superconducting wires based on aligned yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) films this problem has been mostly resolved and critical currents are determined by vortex pinning .",
    "impressive progress has been made to enhance critical currents in these films using both isotropic @xcite and columnar @xcite inclusions . in spite of this progress ,",
    "our understanding of strong pinning mechanisms is far from satisfactory .",
    "theoretical estimates describing the pinning of vortex lines by an array of strong pins at low temperatures were elaborated by ovchinnikov and ivlev.@xcite this theory was applied to describe the behavior of the critical currents in the real ybco films in refs .. in particular , frequently observed power - law decay of the critical current as a function of the magnetic field with a power slightly larger than @xmath3 is naturally explained by this theory .",
    "more recently , it was also argued that strong pins of unknown origin determine critical currents at low magnetic fields in several iron pnictide compounds.@xcite it is not clear , however , to what extent available qualitative estimates describe the real situation . due to the obvious importance of strong pinning by large - size inclusions for real superconducting materials , it is desirable to elaborate a quantitative theory describing pinning in such situations . moreover , the very important issue of pinning suppression by thermal fluctuations does not have any theoretical description in the strong - pinning regime .",
    "in this paper we consider the pinning of vortex lines in a superconductor containing insulating inclusions with lateral sizes larger than the coherence length .",
    "we focus on the pinning of individual vortex lines corresponding to small magnetic fields .",
    "pinning occurs via the trapping of finite - size segments of a vortex line@xcite with a typical length @xmath4 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - trappedline ] .",
    "the critical current is determined by the length of the trapped segment @xmath4 and the pin - breaking force @xmath5 , @xmath6 therefore , in the strong - pinning regime the critical - current problem is mostly reduced to evaluation of the trapped - segment length @xmath4 . in general , trapping of the vortex lines is a complicated dynamic process controlled by the competition between the pinning energy , line tension , and intervortex interactions .",
    "different approaches may be used to evaluate the trapped - segment length .",
    "one can assume that the pinning center always grabs a piece of the vortex line when it is energetically favorable .",
    "this assumption implies that thermal fluctuations facilitate local equilibration . in this case",
    "the parameters of the trapped configurations can be obtained from the energy - balance estimates .",
    "we will call this type of trapping the equilibrium regime .",
    "this energy - balance consideration determines trapped configurations of static vortex lines prepared by cooling in finite magnetic field",
    ". however , such consideration is not applicable to the more typical dynamic scenario when moving lines are trapped after the driving force is slowly reduced down to the critical value . in this case",
    "the line motion close to the critical force is a continuous trapping - detrapping process limited by local instabilities .",
    "the driven vortex can be captured when the line either directly collides with a strong pin or passes sufficiently close to it . in the second case trapping",
    "may occur due to the long - range pin - vortex interaction as a result of local instability.@xcite the line remains trapped until the force acting from the pin does not exceed the pin - breaking force . when the line finally stops , the pinned configuration is expected to be very anisotropic because the transverse pin - to - pin displacements which are determined by trapping events are much smaller than the longitudinal displacements limited by the pin - breaking criteria .    to develop a quantitative picture and verify analytical estimates , we explore in this paper the pinning of the vortex lines by nanoparticles with extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we study the dependence of the critical force on the density of pins , the statistical properties of trapped lines including average values , and the distributions of trapping length and pin - to - pin displacements .",
    "we study long - range behavior of line displacements in the direction of the driving force and in the transverse direction .",
    "we also study in detail the suppression of the apparent critical force by thermal fluctuations and the temperature dependence of the trapping parameters .",

    "in contrast to small defects , the pin - breaking force for large - size defects is limited by the line tension of the vortices . with increasing external force , the tips of the vortex line slide along the surface of the insulating inclusion until they meet near the equator and reconnect leading to the depinning of the vortex . for the in - plane current in the anisotropic layered material , the upper estimate for such a line - tension - limited force can be obtained by considering the simple geometry of equally spaced pins aligned along the @xmath11 axis and neglecting the interaction between vortex tips at the pin surface . in this case , evaluating the external force at which the tips meet , we obtain the following estimate @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the anisotropy factor , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the c - axis coherence length , and @xmath16 is the interlayer period of a layered superconductor .",
    "this force only weakly depends on the size and shape of the pinning center .",
    "the interaction of the vortex line with a remote pin is long ranged , due to the perturbation of the supercurrent flow around the vortex by the pin , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume of the pinning center and @xmath19 are `` depolarization factors '' , which depend on the parameter @xmath20 . in particular , in the case @xmath21 which includes close - to - spherical inclusions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that magnetic force microscopy can be effectively used not only for imaging but also for the manipulation of individual vortices @xcite .",

    "however , it is clear that they can not be applied to the vortex lines in the critical state at low temperatures when moving lines are trapped after the driving force drops below the critical value and equilibration does not take place .",

    ", the value of @xmath176 found for the longitudinal displacements implies that the assumed elastic approximation is not self - consistent in the thermodynamic limit , the average local stress @xmath177 increases with the line length @xmath126 as @xmath178 . in this case",
    "the longitudinal line displacements grow quadratically @xmath175 ^ 2\\rangle= c_l z^{2}$ ] with the coefficient increasing with the line length as @xmath179.@xcite this provides a natural explanation for the strong size dependence of the longitudinal pin - to - pin displacement @xmath51 in the lower plot of fig .  [ fig - trap - param - np ] .",
    "the negative size effects for the trapping lengths in the upper plot of the same figure can also be understood . growing local stress with increasing @xmath139 forces the line to travel longer distances in the longitudinal direction which increases the probability of finding a pin separated by a smaller distance in the @xmath143 direction .",
    "the found exponents are slightly different from the values @xmath180 and @xmath181 obtained in ref .   from the approximate functional renormalization group calculations .",
    "however , a similar situation was found for elastic lines in a plane where the numerically computed index @xmath182  @xcite also exceed the predicted value @xmath183",
    "we see that the transverse displacements somewhat reduce the exponent value in the 3d case .",
    "since the small-@xmath170 exponents are expected to be universal , i.e. , independent of the pinning mechanism , our results suggest that the elastic description will also break down for the weak pinning case .",
    "although we have considered the linear approximation for the elastic forces , this conclusion is expected to hold for the full non - quadratic energy of the deformed vortex line.@xcite    at larger @xmath170 s we observe the regime where both components behave as @xmath184 giving the short - scale indices @xmath185 .",
    "this corresponds to displacements induced by a short - range - correlated random force , and such behavior is actually similar to the static larkin regime for weak pinning .",
    "however , the random forces in our case clearly have a very different origin .",
    "the crossover between different regimes occurs at a wave vector that scales approximately as @xmath186 .",
    "this allows us to approximately collapse the structure factors at different pin densities into a single curve using the scaling @xmath187 .",
    "we found @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "these scaled dependencies are shown on the right - hand side of fig .",

    "we can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig - sqt0](left ) that both structure factors increase with the pin density for all wave vectors .",
    "this means that , in contrast to elemental pin - to - pin displacements @xmath193 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - trap - param - np ] , the line displacements at fixed @xmath143 _ grow _ with increasing pin density .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood .",
    "the displacements at small distances are determined not only by the behavior of @xmath193 but also by the behavior of the trapping length @xmath142 .",
    "all these parameters decrease with increasing pin density , meaning that smaller displacements occur on a smaller length scale .",
    "the net increase of the line displacements at fixed @xmath143 coordinate with increasing @xmath150 is a consequence of a faster @xmath194 decrease than that of @xmath195 , as can be seen from fig .",

    "figure [ fig - ivtrapparamtn20nz2048 ] presents the temperature evolution of the velocity - force dependences and trapping parameters in the critical region for two very different pin densities , @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "we remind that we use the pinning energy of a single pin as the temperature unit . at finite temperatures",
    "the critical force does not have an exact meaning , because the line velocity is finite at all forces due to the thermal creep .",
    "nevertheless , we can introduce a typical force corresponding to the crossover between the flow and creep regimes , similar to the voltage criterion widely used in experiment .",
    "we use the criterion @xmath198 for this force .",
    "the first important observation is that , independently of criterion , the apparent critical force is quite strongly suppressed by the thermal noise .",
    "for example , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig - ivtrapparamtn20nz2048 ] , for the small pin density @xmath196 at the temperature only 5% of the pinning energy , the apparent critical force is already suppressed about fourfold .",
    "as one can see from the trapping - parameter plots , the longitudinal pin - to - pin displacement @xmath51 in the critical region very rapidly decreases with the temperature while the transverse displacement @xmath49 slightly increases with the temperature . as a consequence , at some temperature they become of the same order .",
    "the longitudinal displacement typically has a nonmonotonic dependence on the driving force and reaches a maximum at some force in the critical region ( the maximum - stress force ) .",
    "the trapping length decreases with decreasing line velocity and its value at @xmath198 slightly increases with the temperature .",
    "figure [ fig - fc - t](a ) shows the temperature dependences of the apparent critical forces for a wide range of pin densities .",
    "we can see that these dependences are quite similar .",
    "however , plots of the relative critical forces in fig .",
    "[ fig - fc - t](b ) clearly show that thermal suppression weakens with increasing pin density .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate for the temperature renormalization of the effective pin - breaking force , eq.([renormfp ] ) , due to the @xmath150 dependence under the logarithm . for illustration",
    ", we also present the real - temperature scales on the top axes of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig - fc - t](a , b ) computed for spherical particles with @xmath199 nm and typical ybco parameters .",
    "this scale , however , is very sensitive to the value of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the liquid nitrogen temperature @xmath200k corresponds to the reduced temperature @xmath201 in the plot . for particles with @xmath202 nm",
    "the same real temperature would correspond to the much smaller value @xmath203 .    as we found approximately @xmath204 at @xmath205 , according to the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ crcurrmet_b ] ) we also expect the relation @xmath206 .",
    "this means that , according to eq .",
    "( [ renormfp ] ) , we expect the dependence @xmath207^{2/3}=1-(\\beta_{dp } \\tilde{t})^{2/3}$ ] with @xmath208 .",
    "this is directly verified in fig.[fig - fc - t](c ) where we observe the approximate linear dependencies of @xmath207^{2/3}$ ] versus @xmath209 .",
    "moreover , as shown in the inset , the coefficient @xmath210 found from the linear fits for different pin densities indeed has a logarithmic dependence on @xmath150 , @xmath211 .",
    "these observations provide justification for our assumption that the reduction of the typical pin - breaking force is the main source of thermal suppression of the effective critical force .",
    "we consider now the influence of thermal noise on the long - range behavior of the line displacements .",
    "figures [ fig - sl - ul2-t](a , c ) present the evolution of the structure factor with increasing temperature for the pin density @xmath212 .",
    "we can see that the slope of the small-@xmath170 dependences does not change indicating that the roughening indices @xmath213 and @xmath214 are temperature independent .",
    "however , the coefficient is significantly reduced for the longitudinal displacements and is enlarged for the transverse displacements . correspondingly , as one can see from the line wandering plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sl - ul2-t](b , d ) , the components of displacements in the critical region have opposite tendencies : the longitudinal displacements decrease and the transverse displacements increase with increasing temperature .",
    "as the longitudinal displacements dominate , the lines become more straight in the critical region .",
    "another important observation is that the random - force regime @xmath215 at large @xmath170 is rapidly washed out by thermal noise for both components and is replaced by the isotropic fluctuational line wandering @xmath216 .",
    "using the square - root fit of the pin - density dependence of critical force in fig .",
    "[ fig - fc - np ] , we can restore the @xmath41 dependence of the critical force in real units @xmath217 this coincides with the estimate ( [ crcurrmet_b ] ) which is obtained assuming that the transverse trapping distance @xmath49 is on the order of the pin size @xmath7 . this does not contradict too much our numerical results , because our average values of @xmath49 only slightly exceed the pin size .",
    "note that in our simulations the pin - breaking force @xmath218 is fixed by interaction with the pin while in real superconductors for large - size inclusions it is determined by the in - plane line energy , see eq .",
    "( [ pinbreakfrc ] ) . substituting this estimate",
    ", our result leads to the following estimate for the critical force @xmath219 where , assuming @xmath220 , we estimated @xmath221^{3/2}[\\ln(l_t / s)]^{-1/2}$ ] . for preliminary comparison with experiment",
    "we use results of the recent paper in which approximately spherical ( y - gd)@xmath222o@xmath223 particles with radii @xmath224 nm were embedded into the ybco films .",
    "the typical concentration of particles was @xmath225@xmath119 . for estimates , we assume the temperature - dependent london penetration depth as @xmath226nm@xmath227 with @xmath228k and the anisotropy @xmath115 .",
    "such parameters correspond to the reduced concentration @xmath229 . from the above zero - temperature result , we estimate @xmath230 and the critical current @xmath231 amp/@xmath232 which is close to the low - field experimental value at @xmath233k , @xmath234 amp/@xmath232 .",
    "the reduced temperature can be evaluated as @xmath235 $ ] . at 55 k",
    "this gives @xmath236 . according to fig .",
    "[ fig - fc - t](b ) , at this temperature thermal suppression of the critical current is expected to be around 50% .",
    "taking this factor and the temperature dependence of the parameters into account , we expect a critical current @xmath237 amp/@xmath232 , which again is quite close to the experimental value of @xmath238 amp/@xmath232 .",
    "we can conclude that the our strong - pinning result for the critical current is in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "our results show that the wandering of dynamically pinned lines is strongly anisotropic , displacements in the direction of motion are much larger than displacements in the transverse direction . in principle , experimentally this can be directly demonstrated using flux visualization techniques , such as a scanning squid or hall probes . with these techniques individual vortices",
    "can only be resolved at small fields .",
    "usually statically pinned vortices are visualized after cooling in fixed magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , it should also be possible to visualize shapes of the dynamically - pinned vortices near the boundary of the bean profile , which is formed when the magnetic field is applied after cooling of a superconducting sample in zero field .",
    "we expect the vortex field profiles to be strongly elongated along the direction of motion .",
    "the elongation length along the direction of motion is given by the longitudinal displacement @xmath51 at a distance on the order of the london penetration depth .",
    "this length is expected to decrease with increasing temperature .    in conclusion",
    ", we developed a quantitative description of individual vortex lines pinned by an array of nanoparticles .",
    "we found that the critical force grows roughly as the square root of the pin density .",
    "this result is consistent with qualitative estimates assuming that for our pin - density range trapping events mostly occur as a result of direct collisions with pinning centers .",
    "the apparent critical force is strongly suppressed by thermal noise .",
    "the relative suppression reduces with increasing pin density .",
    "the configurations of pinned lines are strongly anisotropic , displacements in the drive directions are much larger than those in the transverse direction .",
    "the displacement anisotropy is rapidly reduced by thermal noise mostly due to the rapid reduction of the longitudinal displacements .",
    "this leads to straightening of the lines in the critical region . analyzing the behavior of the structure factors at small wave vectors",
    ", we found that the roughening index for the longitudinal displacements exceeds one .",
    "this means that the local stresses in the critical region increase with the line length indicating a breakdown of the elastic description in the thermodynamic limit .",
