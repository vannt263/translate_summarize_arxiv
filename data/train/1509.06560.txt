    "<S> we note that the topological channel can be created electrically in the bulk of the bg sample , completely avoiding sharp sample edges , the main source of intervalley scattering @xcite , which could reduce the splitting efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , using an electrically tunable channel geometry ballistic beamsplitters could be created to prove the spin entanglement via noise @xcite , so far an elusive goal . </S>",
    "<S> the spin relaxation and decoherence in bg are expected to be weak due to the small spin - orbit coupling @xcite and the sparsity of nuclear spins .    </S>",
