    "the galaxy malin 1 has remained a singularly unusual and puzzling object for nearly two decades . as described in the discovery paper by @xcite and in later work by @xcite ,",
    "it has the largest radial extent of any known spiral galaxy , with low - surface brightness emission extending out to @xmath5 kpc , and its disk was found to have an extrapolated central surface brightness of only @xmath6 mag arcsec@xmath2 , far fainter than any galaxy previously known .",
    "the exponential scale length of this disk was determined to be @xmath7 kpc . despite the faint surface brightness of its disk ,",
    "malin 1 is a massive galaxy with a total optical luminosity of @xmath8 mag @xcite .",
    "based on these properties , it is considered the prototypical giant low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy . even in comparison with other giant lsb galaxies discovered subsequently @xcite , the properties of malin 1 are unusual ; no other galaxy disk has been found with a surface brightness and scale length that approach these extreme values .",
    "furthermore , it is one of the most gas - rich galaxies known , with an mass of @xmath9 @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the rotation curve measured by @xcite reaches an asymptotic value of @xmath11 km s@xmath12  and extends to radii as large as 110 kpc from the galaxy center , implying a dynamical mass of order @xmath13 @xmath10although the disk inclination is uncertain and the velocity structure shows some warping and noncircular motions .",
    "the implications of this object for understanding the overall population of disk galaxies are significant .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite , galaxies like malin 1 would likely be underrepresented in magnitude - limited galaxy surveys because of surface brightness selection effects .",
    "even if such extreme giant lsb galaxies are rare , which appears to be the case ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the properties of malin 1 pose interesting challenges to theories of galaxy formation .",
    "models of disk formation in cold dark matter halos are not easily able to reproduce the properties of such enormously extended disks , although scenarios have been proposed which might account for the formation of malin 1-type galaxies as rare density peaks in voids @xcite or by secular evolution and radial mixing in ordinary disk galaxies @xcite . as the most diffuse and gas - rich giant lsb galaxy known , malin 1 is also a particularly interesting laboratory for understanding issues of disk stability and thresholds for the onset of star formation @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a reexamination of an archival _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) image of malin 1 , which reveals that the galaxy s optical morphology is rather different from what had previously been determined based on ground - based imaging .",
    "it is shown that malin 1 actually contains a fairly normal stellar disk typical of an early - type barred spiral , and that based on the presence of this disk malin 1 does not satisfy the standard criteria for being classified as an lsb galaxy despite its having the most extended low surface brightness outer regions of any known disk galaxy .",
    "this is not merely a semantic distinction , as this new observation significantly truncates the range of parameter space ( in terms of central surface brightness and scale length ) populated by real galaxy disks by removing an extremely aberrant data point from the observed galaxy population . a new optical spectrum of the galaxy is also used to derive its bulge velocity dispersion and to reexamine the classification of its active nucleus .",
    "malin 1 has a redshift of 0.0825 @xcite , corresponding to a luminosity distance of @xmath14 mpc and a projected angular scale of 1.53 kpc arcsec@xmath12  for a cosmology with @xmath15 km s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . for consistency ,",
    "observed quantities taken from the literature and listed in this paper have been rescaled to this cosmology .",
    "images of malin 1 were obtained with the wfpc2 camera as part of _",
    "hst_program go-5946 ( pi : impey ) on 1996 march 10 .",
    "the galaxy was observed for one orbit each in the f300w ( @xmath18-band ) and f814w ( @xmath0-band ) filters , with the galaxy placed on the wf3 ccd near the center of the full wfpc2 field of view .",
    "each orbit was split into four individual exposures for removal of cosmic - ray hits .",
    "the f300w exposures were read out with @xmath19 pixel binning on the ccd , while the f814w images were read out in the standard unbinned mode .",
    "total exposure times were 2100 s in each filter .",
    "this dataset was previously analyzed by @xcite , who studied the properties of faint galaxies in the same wfpc2 field as malin 1 , but they did not discuss the structure of malin 1 itself .",
    "the images were retrieved from the _ hst _  data archive and individual exposures were combined using standard tasks in iraf / stsdas . figure [ fig - image ] shows a portion of the f814w wfpc2 mosaic centered on malin 1 .",
    "an image of the entire wfpc2 mosaic is shown by @xcite .",
    "if the full _ hst _  image is viewed with extremely high contrast , some of the very low surface brightness outer spiral structure can just barely be seen at radii of up to @xmath20 from the galaxy center , and the faint spiral features match the structures visible in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "however , the s / n in the wfpc2 image at these large radii is too low to perform useful measurements of the surface brightness of the outer disk .",
    "the f300w image also has very low s / n and will not be discussed further in this paper .",
    "a new optical spectrum of malin 1 was obtained at the keck ii telescope on 2005 may 16 ut with the esi spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the exposure time was 1800 s with a 075-wide slit , yielding a spectrum with @xmath21 over the range 380010000   and s",
    "/ n @xmath22 per pixel in the continuum at 5100  .",
    "the slit was oriented at the parallactic angle for the midpoint of the observation .",
    "spectral extraction was done using a 1  width , and the extracted echelle orders were wavelength - calibrated using observations of hgne , xe , and cuar lamps and flux - calibrated using an observation of the standard star bd  + 284211 .",
    "the ten individual echelle orders were combined into a single spectrum , weighted by the s / n in the overlap regions between orders .",
    "several k - giant stars were also observed on the same night during twilight for use as velocity templates .",
    "the wfpc2 image clearly reveals the morphology of malin 1 at small angular scales where previous ground - based images were unable to discern the details of its structure .",
    "the galaxy is seen to have a compact bulge dominating the light profile out to @xmath23 , a bar of length @xmath24 , and a nearly face - on disk with a hint of spiral structure that can be traced out to @xmath25 .",
    "the disk morphology appears smooth and there are no obvious dust lanes , knots , or star - forming complexes .",
    "apart from the remarkable but nearly invisible outer lsb structure , malin 1 has the morphology of an sb0/a galaxy .    to decompose the galaxy s structure into its subcomponents",
    ", model fits to the wfpc2 image were performed using the 2-dimensional fitting package galfit @xcite .",
    "the components used in the model fit included an exponential disk , a srsic - law bulge , and a bar .",
    "since galfit does not include bar models such as a freeman ( 1966 ) bar or a flat bar @xcite , the bar component was modeled using a srsic profile with the index @xmath26 constrained to be @xmath27 to approximate a bar with a flat core , and with this constraint the bar has @xmath28 in the best - fitting model .",
    "in addition , a central point source component was added to allow for the possibility of unresolved emission from the active nucleus .",
    "the point - spread function for the f814w filter was generated using the tinytim software package @xcite .",
    "figure [ galfit ] shows the results of the galfit modeling .",
    "the structure of the galaxy is reproduced well overall , although there are systematic residuals around the bulge and inner bar region .",
    "these residuals could be reduced somewhat if the constraint on the srsic index of the bar were relaxed , at the expense of having an unrealistic bar profile with a very centrally peaked structure . however , whether the bar profile is constrained or not in the fit has almost no effect on the central surface brightness or scale length of the disk component , since the disk parameters are mainly determined from the region around @xmath29 where it dominates the galaxy profile .",
    "figure [ radprof ] shows the galaxy s radial profile as measured from the wfpc2 image and from the galfit model .",
    "the radial profiles were measured using the iraf task ellipse , which fits elliptical isophotes to the image at a series of fixed semimajor axis lengths , following the methods described by @xcite .",
    "conversion from _ hst _",
    "f814w filter magnitudes to standard cousins @xmath0-band vega - based magnitudes was done using the synphot package in iraf , assuming an s0-type spectrum from the spectral atlas of @xcite .",
    "the brightness profiles include a correction for galactic extinction ( @xmath30 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a @xmath31-correction of 0.08 mag for the @xmath0 band , determined using the @xcite s0 template spectrum , and a correction for cosmological surface brightness dimming of 0.34 mag .",
    "brightness profiles derived from 02-wide slices along the major and minor axes of the bar are shown in figure [ cuts ] . aside from small deviations in the disk due to the spiral arms , the major and minor axis brightness profiles are very symmetric about the nucleus .",
    "another issue to consider is the effect of inclination on the disk surface brightness .",
    "one simple method that is commonly used to correct for inclination is to apply the relation @xmath32 = @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the major and minor axis lengths of the disk , and @xmath36 is a parameter whose value ranges from 0 for an optically thick disk to 1 for the optically thin case @xcite . from the galfit decomposition , the disk axis ratio @xmath37 is 0.858 , consistent with the mean ellipticity of @xmath38 measured by the ellipse routine over the disk - dominated region from @xmath39 to 6 arcsec .",
    "this corresponds to a surface brightness correction of @xmath40 mag in the optically thin case .",
    "given the approximate nature of this method and the small magnitude of the correction , we choose not to apply this correction to the measured quantities , but we consider it as a minor effect that would tend to increase the central surface brightness by a small amount .",
    "the structural parameters derived from the galfit modeling are listed in table 1 . while the formal fitting uncertainties from galfit are negligibly small , the actual uncertainties on the derived model parameters are predominantly systematic due to real deviations of the galaxy components from the simple fitting functions used by galfit and are therefore difficult to estimate .",
    "trial galfit runs with slightly different fitting models ( i.e. , without constraints on the bar srsic index @xmath26 or without including a point source component ) yielded magnitude differences of order @xmath41 mag for the bulge and bar components relative to the best - fit model listed in table 1 , which gives some indication of the likely systematic uncertainties in the decomposition .",
    "different choices of bulge and bar models or omission of the nuclear point source led to relatively small changes in the exponential disk parameters , at the level of @xmath42 mag in total magnitude and @xmath43 in scale length .",
    "as previously shown by @xcite , the bulge spectrum is consistent with a predominantly old stellar population .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge was measured from the keck spectrum by direct fitting of broadened and diluted stellar spectra in the wavelength domain , following the methods described by @xcite .",
    "the fit was performed over the rest wavelength range 52105480  , which contains fe @xmath445270 and several other reasonably strong features .",
    "the mg@xmath35  lines were excluded from the fit since the galaxy spectrum has a lower fe/@xmath45 abundance ratio than typical nearby k giant stars , as is generally found for high - dispersion galaxies .",
    "weak [ ] @xmath46 emission appears to be present as well .",
    "fits were performed using nine template stars with spectral types between g8 iii and k3 iii were .",
    "the best fit was found with a k0 star , giving @xmath47 km s@xmath12 , where the final uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of the fitting uncertainty from the best - fitting template ( 10 km s@xmath12 ) and the standard deviation of the results from fitting all nine templates ( 11 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "figure [ figdispersion ] shows the fit of the broadened ko star to the spectrum of malin 1 over this region .",
    "the velocity dispersion fitting code was also used to generate starlight - subtracted spectra in the regions surrounding the h@xmath48and h@xmath45  emission lines . using the best - fitting k - type stellar template and allowing for a featureless continuum dilution yielded an adequate continuum subtraction over these regions , giving a pure emission - line spectrum ( figure [ figspectrum ] ) .",
    "reddening - corrected emission line flux ratios measured from the nuclear spectrum are [ ] @xmath49 / [ ] @xmath50 = 3.1 , [ ] @xmath50 / h@xmath48  = 1.9 , [ ] @xmath51 / h@xmath45  = 0.3 , and [ ] @xmath52 / h@xmath45  = 0.85",
    ". these measurements are consistent with a liner classification @xcite .",
    "@xcite had previously found [ ] / h@xmath48  = 4.8 and classified malin 1 as a high - excitation seyfert galaxy ; presumably this resulted from not having performed a starlight subtraction and therefore missing most of the h@xmath48  flux .",
    "approximately 30% of s0sa galaxies contain liner nuclei @xcite so malin 1 is not unusual in exhibiting this type of activity .",
    "there is at best weak evidence for a broad component to the h@xmath45  emission line .",
    "model fits including 3 gaussian components for the three narrow emission lines are somewhat improved by the addition of a broad component ( having a best - fitting width of fwhm = @xmath53 km s@xmath12 ) , but the relatively low s / n of the spectrum precludes any definitive conclusions regarding the possible presence of a broad - line component .",
    "the measurements described above indicate a very different structure for malin 1 than that which has previously been found .",
    "@xcite fit the galaxy profile with a model consisting of an @xmath54-law bulge and an exponential disk , and determined that the bulge had @xmath55 , which corresponds to 4.4 kpc for the cosmology assumed in this paper .",
    "@xcite found similar results from newer ground - based imaging data .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "image shows that the bulge radius is smaller than this value by nearly an order of magnitude , and it seems likely that the bulge region described by @xcite was actually the combined light from the bulge , bar , and normal disk of the galaxy . since the surface brightness of the disk within several arcseconds of the nucleus is much fainter than the surface brightness of the bulge or bar , it is not surprising that it would be difficult to recognize the disk in ground - based imaging of average seeing .",
    "interestingly , @xcite note that the nucleus `` appears to be surrounded by extended nebulosity of somewhat high surface brightness '' .",
    "in retrospect , this `` nebulosity '' must have been starlight from the disk itself .",
    "recent work by @xcite on the @xmath0-band photometric properties of sb0 galaxies provides an ideal comparison sample to examine the structure of malin 1 in the context of galaxies of similar hubble type .",
    "based on a sample of 14 nearby galaxies , they found that sb0 galaxies generally have nearly exponential bulge profiles with @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the range 0.3 to 1.0 kpc with a mean of 0.6 kpc , so malin 1 s bulge properties are typical for its hubble type . with a bulge absolute magnitude of @xmath58 mag and @xmath59 km s@xmath12",
    ", malin 1 also falls within the normal range of sb0 galaxies in the faber - jackson relation ( see fig . 5 of aguerri et al.2005 ) .",
    "the disk of malin 1 also has properties similar to the sb0 sample .",
    "figure [ sb0 ] plots the central @xmath0-band surface brightness against disk scale length .",
    "while malin 1 falls toward the lower end of the sample in terms of its surface brightness , it is still consistent with the normal range for this hubble type .",
    "the only aspect of malin 1 s structure that appears different from the sb0 sample is the ratio of bulge to disk radius .",
    "@xcite find a surprisingly tight coupling with @xmath60 for their sample , while malin 1 has @xmath61 .",
    "a portion of this difference could be the result of the different bar model adopted for the galfit analysis , however , since @xcite used freeman bar or flat bar models in their 1-dimensional radial profile fits , and different assumptions for the bar profile will directly affect the flux inferred to arise from the outer part of the bulge . in any case , a bulge - to - disk scale length ratio of 0.13 is well within the normal range for low or high surface brightness spiral galaxies of a range of hubble types @xcite .",
    "overall , these results indicate that out to @xmath62 kpc , the optical structure of malin 1 does not deviate very significantly from the general population of early - type barred galaxies .    the low - surface brightness structure at large radii appears to be a photometrically distinct component of the galaxy s structure rather than a smooth extension of the normal inner disk . for a disk scale length of 4.8 kpc , the extrapolated surface brightness of the inner disk at @xmath63 ( equivalent to @xmath64 kpc",
    ") would be undetectably faint : 36.1 mag arcsec@xmath2  in the @xmath65 band , which is far fainter than the actual outer disk brightness of @xmath66 mag arcsec@xmath2  at this radius @xcite",
    ". there may be a break in the exponential light profile of the disk at radii greater than @xmath67 , but deeper images would be needed to trace the surface brightness profile in the transition region between the inner disk and the extended outer disk .    given the presence of this newly identified disk in malin 1 , should it still be considered an lsb galaxy ?",
    "lsb galaxies are generally classified as such based on the extrapolated central surface brightness of their disk components .",
    "a crucial point is that the lsb classification applies only to the disk component .",
    "giant lsb disk galaxies have high surface brightness bulges that dominate the light of the central regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the _ total _ light profiles of giant lsb galaxies apparently always have high surface brightness central regions , and a radial profile decomposition is required in order to determine whether a galaxy should be classified as having a giant lsb disk or not . clearly , to perform such classifications in a meaningful way , observations with sufficient spatial resolution to decompose the bulge and inner disk components accurately are required .    while there is perhaps no universal agreement on the surface brightness threshold for a galaxy disk to be considered an lsb disk ,",
    "a common criterion is a central surface brightness fainter than @xmath68 mag arcsec@xmath2  @xcite . as noted by @xcite , a galaxy with a central surface brightness fainter than this level would represent a @xmath69 deviation from the distribution of surface brightness found by @xcite and",
    "would therefore be a very unusual outlier if the actual distribution of disk surface brightnesses were described by freeman s law . to compare the disk properties of malin 1 with this criterion ,",
    "the @xmath65 magnitude of the malin 1 disk was estimated by performing synthetic photometry on the s0 template spectrum from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath70 color index for this spectrum is 2.2 mag . assuming this @xmath70 color for the disk of malin 1 , it has an estimated @xmath71 mag arcsec@xmath2 , which would not qualify it as an lsb disk color of 2.0 mag for s0 galaxies ; using this value instead of the synphot color would yield @xmath72 mag arcsec@xmath2 . ] . in the classification system of @xcite ,",
    "malin 1 would have an `` intermediate surface brightness '' disk .",
    "another related criterion that has been applied to distinguish low and high surface brightness galaxies is a `` diffuseness index '' for the disk , which combines central surface brightness and scale length into a single parameter .",
    "the diffuseness index criterion given by @xcite is @xmath73 for a galaxy to be classified as a giant lsb disk .",
    "based on the galfit results and the assumed @xmath70 color index of 2.2 mag , the disk in malin 1 has @xmath74 , which lies well inside the high surface brightness range for this parameter .",
    "thus , based on either central surface brightness or diffuseness , the disk of malin 1 out to @xmath75 kpc should _ not _ be considered an lsb disk according to conventional criteria .",
    "malin 1 still might be considered an lsb galaxy based on the average surface brightness over its _ entire _ disk area , however .",
    "according to @xcite , the galaxy s total luminosity is @xmath76 mag .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "measurements yield @xmath77 mag for the combined bulge , bar , and normal disk components . assuming @xmath78 mag for an s0 galaxy as determined from synphot",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath79 mag .",
    "thus , the comparison between the _ hst _  and ground - based measurements indicates that the majority of the galaxy s total optical luminosity lies in the extended disk region beyond the normal disk .",
    "it would be useful to confirm this result with new ground - based imaging data and a single profile decomposition over the entire radial range of the galaxy ; the _ hst _  image could be used to exclude background galaxies and improve the measurement accuracy for the outer disk brightness profile .    in comparison with",
    "all other known disk galaxies , malin 1 has always appeared as a unique and distant outlier in plots of central surface brightness against disk scale length ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the previously measured disk scale length and central surface brightness ( @xmath80 kpc ; @xmath81 mag arcsec@xmath2 ) from @xcite are far outside the ranges found for normal spirals or even for other giant lsb galaxies . in the giant lsb sample of @xcite , for example",
    ", the disk scale lengths range from 5 to 13 kpc and the faintest disk has @xmath82 mag arcsec@xmath2 . clearly , however , when the _ normal _ disk of malin 1 is compared with the disk properties of other galaxies in these diagrams , it is no longer an outlier .",
    "it might be argued that the extended outer structure in malin 1 still has the form of a disk with a very low extrapolated central surface brightness and large scale length and that this extended disk remains an outlier relative to all other known galaxies .",
    "however , it seems more reasonable and consistent to compare the normal , central disk of malin 1 with those of other galaxies , and to consider its extended outer disk in the context of the extreme outer disks of other nearby spiral galaxies , which sometimes display structures similar to ( albeit less extended than ) that of malin 1 .",
    "recent work has revealed a great deal of detail and a diversity of properties among the extreme outer disk regions of some nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "deep narrow - band observations of some late - type spirals have detected regions far beyond the galaxies optical radii @xcite , and _ galex _",
    "observations of the nearby spiral m83 have detected uv - bright stars in the outer disk at distances of greater than 20 kpc from the galaxy center @xcite . in these examples , the regions of recent star formation have filamentary , spiral - like structures with an appearance similar to the outer disk regions of malin 1 .",
    "@xcite noted that the distant outer regions of spiral disks have physical properties ( such as low column densities of gas and high gas mass to stellar mass ratios ) that are very similar to the inferred properties of malin 1 .",
    "it is now apparent that this similarity is not merely a coincidence the parameters previously found for malin 1 were precisely those of its extreme outer disk region .",
    "extended outer disk structure has recently been found out to @xmath83 kpc in m31 as well @xcite , but in the case of m31 the extended outer structure appears to be a smooth continuation of the exponential profile of the main disk , in contrast to the photometrically decoupled outer structure of malin 1 .",
    "the stellar disk of the late - type spiral ngc 300 also follows a single exponential profile from its inner regions to the outer disk at distances up to 10 scale lengths @xcite .",
    "new observations of early - type barred galaxies have revealed surprising outer disk structures as well .",
    "@xcite have found that at least 25% of sb0-sbb galaxies have photometric profiles characterized by an outer exponential disk component with a larger scale length than the inner , main disk component .",
    "the transition from the inner to outer disk occurs at 36 scale lengths of the inner disk and at surface brightnesses of 22.625.6 mag arcsec@xmath2 , and spiral structure is often seen in the outer disk region .",
    "erwin et al .",
    "call such structures `` antitruncated '' disks .",
    "malin 1 appears to fit within this category , although deeper images would be needed to determine the structure of the transition region between the inner and outer disks .",
    "simulations by @xcite have explored one possible mechanism that could form such highly extended outer disks , by the tidal shredding of dwarf galaxies in the outskirts of an m31-sized galaxy . with an initial apocenter of @xmath84 kpc ,",
    "the dwarf satellites were tidally distorted into extended disks having spiral - like filamentary structure , extending to over 100 kpc from the center of the larger galaxy .",
    "the tidal debris tends to evolve into a nearly exponential profile , with scale lengths of up to 50 kpc , depending on the compactness of the original stellar distribution in the dwarf galaxy .",
    "could other giant lsb galaxies possess inner , high surface brightness disks that have gone undetected ?",
    "several of the other known giant lsb galaxies lie at distances comparable to that of malin 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and inadequate spatial resolution could cause a normal disk to be missed in a bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "this would be a natural pitfall of fitting a simple 2-component model to a galaxy with a bright central region ( including a bulge and disk ) and a very diffuse and extended outer disk that was brighter than a simple extension of the inner disk profile at large radii .",
    "the outer disk would dominate the fit at large radii and therefore determine the scale length and central surface brightness of the exponential disk component in the fit , and the inner , high surface brightness disk , if present , would be subsumed in the outer part of the bulge profile .",
    "deep , high - resolution imaging of a representative sample of giant lsb galaxies would be useful to clarify the nature of these objects .",
    "the stellar disk of malin 1 has long been thought to be an extreme and distant outlier compared to the disk properties of all other known spiral galaxies .",
    "the archival _ hst _  data demonstrates that the central structure of malin 1 is that of a normal early - type barred spiral galaxy , and the central surface brightness of its disk is @xmath85 magnitudes brighter than the value originally found by @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to consider malin 1 not as an lsb galaxy , but rather as a galaxy with the normal structural components of an early - type barred spiral , which is embedded in a remarkably extended , optically faint , and gas - rich outer structure beyond its normal disk .",
    "@xcite remark that giant lsb galaxies such as malin 1 are `` truly enigmatic in that normal formation processes were at work to create the bulge component but no conspicuous stellar disk ever formed around this bulge . ''",
