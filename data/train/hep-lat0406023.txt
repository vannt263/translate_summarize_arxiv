    "according to the renormalization group theory , it is possible to classify continuous phase transitions into universality classes , determined by few global properties , such as space dimensionality , number of components of the order parameter , the range of interaction , symmetry group and symmetry - breaking pattern @xcite .",
    "some physical quantities , called universal , are independent from the microscopic structure of the interaction : models belonging to the same universality class have the same critical exponents , scaling functions and universal amplitude ratios .",
    "one of the most important universality classes are the @xmath0 classes , which are characterized by a @xmath9-component order parameter , and a symmetry group @xmath0 which is spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath12 in the low - temperature phase .",

    "this universality class can describe the critical behavior of many physical systems , which undergo a second order phase transition .",
    "for instance , the liquid - vapor transition in simple fluids and the magnetic transition in uniaxial ( anti-)ferromagnets belong to the ising universality class ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the xy model , which corresponds to @xmath14 , describes the helium superfluid transition and the meissner transition in type - ii superconductors . if the order parameter has @xmath15 components , we get the heisenberg universality class , which describes the critical behavior of isotropic magnets .",
    "the three - dimensional @xmath16 model is related to the finite - temperature phase transition in qcd with two light flavors @xcite .    in this article , we study the critical equation of state and universal quantities for the @xmath0 three - dimensional universality class , with @xmath17 .",

    "the @xmath18-@xmath19 @xmath20 model is relevant for the so - called @xmath5 theory of high-@xmath6 superconductivity @xcite , since , according to this theory , the @xmath5 symmetry should be approximately realized at a multicritical point of the phase diagram multicritical fixed point is in fact unstable : this implies that the @xmath5 symmetry is not realized asymptotically at the multicritical point , but it controls the critical behavior in a preasymptotic region for @xmath21 . ] . according to universality arguments",

    "for all these @xmath0 models , we first analyze the perturbative series available , in both fixed - dimension scheme @xcite and @xmath8-expansion @xcite ; by resumming these series we determine the critical exponents and the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the small - magnetization expansion of the critical equation of state in the high - temperature phase . in fixed - dimension",
