    "the rare - earth pyrochlore magnets , with chemical formula r@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , exhibit a variety of low - temperature phenomena , from magnetic ordering in er@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  [ ] , to spin ice states in ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  [ ] and dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and possible spin liquid behaviour in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  [ ] . in each case , the magnetic properties are due to the magnetic moments of the rare earth ions , which are proportional to @xmath3 , the total angular momentum of the ion , and to interactions between them . in spite of rather large values of @xmath3 derived from hund s rules ,",
    "the rare - earth pyrochlores are essentially quantum magnets : a strong crystal electric field ( cef ) lowers the @xmath4-fold degeneracy of the rare earth ions into singlets and doublets , with rather large energy differences between the levels . in many cases ,",
    "the cef ground state is a doublet , which is treated as a basic two - level quantum mechanical system .",
    "recently , there has been a great deal of effort to describe these various rare earth pyrochlores within the same phenomenological model , the spin-1/2 nearest - neighbour exchange interaction .",
    "this modeling process is straightforward for materials such as er@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  and yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , whose cef ground state doublets are in fact spinors .",
    "however , tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  has proven to be especially difficult to model , for two reasons .",
    "first , the cef ground state doublet of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  is not a spinor .",
    "second , tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  is complicated by the presence of a low - lying cef excited state just 17.9 k above the ground state , which tends to mix into the ground state because of the exchange interaction .",
    "the rare earth ions in pyrochlore crystals are located at the 16d wyckoff position of the space group @xmath5 .",
    "there are four 16d sites in the _ primitive _ unit cell , located on the vertices of a tetrahedron . the local site symmetry ( cef symmetry )",
    "is @xmath6 .",
    "the 3-fold ( @xmath7 ) axes point in different directions for the different sites : @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 $ ] for sites # 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "these directions define a local @xmath12-axis for each site on a tetrahedron . for non - kramers ions ( such as tb@xmath0 or ho@xmath0 ) , the cef states are singlets or doublets belonging to the @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 representations of @xmath16 . for kramers ions ( such as er@xmath0 , yb@xmath0 or dy@xmath0 ) , the cef states are doublets belonging to either the @xmath17 or @xmath18 representations of @xmath19 , the double group of @xmath16 .",
    "the cef ground states for er@xmath0 in er@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  and yb@xmath0 in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2belong to @xmath17 , which is isomorphic to spin-1/2",
    ". therefore cef ground state doublets of er@xmath0 and yb@xmath0 can be easily mapped to a spin-1/2 spinor by an appropriate renormalisation of the matrix elements for the operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "here we are concerned with finding a map between the non - kramers ( @xmath15 ) doublet and a spin-1/2 ( @xmath17 ) doublet .",
    "because these two kinds of doublets transform differently under rotations , such a map must be constructed with care .",
    "in fact , a symmetry - preserving map exists if these doublets are considered in groups of 4 ( the four vertices of a tetrahedron in the pyrochlore lattice ) .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe the cef ground state of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , and the map between tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  and spin-1/2 single tetrahedron states is defined .",
    "the exchange interaction is treated in section iii , for the general case , the spin-1/2 case , and for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",

    "the magnetisation is discussed in section v. section vi contains concluding remarks .",
    "the cef hamiltonian for the rare earth sites in r@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 are stevens operators , @xmath24-th order polynomials of the operator @xmath25 , the total angular momentum .",
    "@xmath26 are constants determined experimentally",
    ". there have been several determinations of @xmath26 for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ; all@xcite but the most recent@xcite are consistent with each other .",
    "the differences in these constants do not affect the symmetries of the cef states , but they are eventually reflected in the exchange constants ( see section v ) .    according to hund s rules ,",
    "the total angular momentum of the tb@xmath0 ion is @xmath27 .",
    "the cef lifts the 13-fold degeneracy into singlets and doublets .",
    "the cef ground state of tb@xmath0 in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  is a doublet,@xcite @xmath28 where the quantisation axis points along the @xmath7 axis , which points in a different direction at each site .",
    "the quantisation axis defines a local @xmath12-axis . in this way , a different set of local axes",
    "is defined for each site on a tetrahedron ( see appendix a for a detailed description ) .",
    "the matrix elements for the operators @xmath29 within the @xmath30 doublet are zero , while @xmath31 here @xmath32 subscripts are used to denote local axes , while superscripts will be used to denote global axes .      in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , the first excited cef state ( also a doublet ) lies only @xmath33  k above the ground state . therefore , as was recognised long ago,@xcite there is a significant admixture of this excited state to the lowest energy states",
    ". however , the symmetry of the lowest energy states can not be affected by this admixture .",
    "the first excited cef state is@xcite @xmath34 the matrix element for @xmath20 within this doublet is @xmath35 and the matrix elements for @xmath21 are again zero .",
    "the mixing of the first cef excited state to the ground state will depend on the matrix elements @xmath36 and @xmath37      with four sites per tetrahedron , there are sixteen tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  tetrahedron states of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a non - kramers doublet on the @xmath40th site . in a similar fashion , we can also define sixteen spin-1/2 tetrahedron states , which will be denoted as @xmath41 .",
    "each of these kets represents a classical state where each spin can be visualised as pointing into or out of the tetrahedron .",
    "there are two anti - ferromagnetic states , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with all four spins pointing into ( @xmath44 ) or out of @xmath45 ) the tetrahedron (  all - in / all - out \" states ) , while the six states of the form @xmath46 are ferromagnetic , with two spins pointing in and two spins pointing out of the tetrahedron (  2-in-2-out \" spin ice states ) .",
    "in addition , there are eight  3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out \" states .",
    "the symmetry group of a tetrahedron in the pyrochlore lattice is @xmath47 , with representations @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "both the tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2   and the spin-1/2 tetrahedron states can be used as basis functions to generate a ( reducible ) representation of @xmath47 . in both cases , _ in spite of different transformation properties of the individual site states _ , the decomposition is @xmath50 .",
    "this finding allows us to define a map between the tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  ( non - kramers ) tetrahedron states and spin-1/2 tetrahedron states .",
    "the map between the tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  and spin-1/2 tetrahedron basis states is @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for time reversal ( represented in the standard way as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is complex conjugation ) and the exponent @xmath55 for the 2-in-2-out states and the 3-in-1-out spin-1/2 states ( but not the 1-in-3-out states ) ; @xmath56 otherwise .",
    "the phase @xmath57 is a reflection of the non - triviality of the map .",
    "it is worth noting that the tetrahedron states formed from the third kind of doublet ( belonging to the @xmath18 representation of @xmath19 ) generate a representation with decomposition @xmath58 .",
    "therefore there is no map between @xmath18 tetrahedron states and spin-1/2 tetrahedron states that is generally valid .",
    "the cef ground state of dy@xmath0 in dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  belongs to this case .",
    "the exchange interaction is a phenomenological model that describes the energy dependence of different relative orientations of neighbouring magnetic moments .",
    "the general form of the exchange hamiltonian is governed by the symmetry of the crystal . in a highly symmetric crystal ,",
    "the number of free parameters of the hamiltonian is small .",

    "note that in the special case when @xmath68 , the exchange interaction is isotropic , @xmath69 .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath70 .",
    "then the eigenstates of @xmath71 are classical states in which every spin is parallel to its local @xmath12-axis , pointing either into or out of each tetrahedron .",
    "since each spin sits on the vertex of two vertex - sharing tetrahedra , a spin which points out of one tetrahedron necessarily points into the other .",
    "when @xmath72 , the ground state is doubly degenerate : all four spins point into or out of each tetrahedron in the lattice .",
    "when @xmath73 , the ground state is the highly degenerate 2-in-2-out  spin ice \" state .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath60 will be reserved for effective spin-1/2 models .",
    "the coupling constants for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2  will be denoted @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xmath76 ( [ hex ] ) and @xmath77 ( [ htbex ] ) have exactly the same form , but with different coupling constants .",
    "also , @xmath76 acts on spin-1/2 states , while @xmath77 acts on @xmath27 states .",

    "the exchange constants @xmath60 in @xmath78 will be expressed in terms of the constants @xmath74 in @xmath77 .",
    "we will now analyse the models @xmath76 and @xmath77 in more detail .",
    "pairs of nearest neighbours can be visualised as lines that connect nearest neighbour sites on the lattice . in the pyrochlore lattice , these lines are precisely the edges of the tetrahedra .",
    "the tetrahedra occur in two orientations , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus the sum over nearest neighbours can be split into two parts : the set of all @xmath79 tetrahedra and the set of all @xmath80 tetrahedra .",
    "then the exchange hamiltonian can be written as @xmath81 let @xmath82 index the @xmath79 tetrahedra .",
    "for example , @xmath83 is the @xmath20 operator ( using the local @xmath12-axis ) for the @xmath40th ( @xmath40=1,2,3,4 ) site on the @xmath82th @xmath79 tetrahedra .",

    "there are two orientations of tetrahedra , which we call @xmath79 ( green ) and @xmath80 ( pink ) .",
    "the lines connecting the ions ( the edges of the tetrahedra ) are the exchange paths .",
    "the labels on the ions ( 1 - 4 ) and the @xmath79 tetrahedra ( @xmath82 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) illustrate how each ion on a @xmath80 tetrahedron also belongs to an @xmath79 tetrahedron .",
    "[ fig1 ] , height=230 ]    the operator @xmath90 can also be expressed as a sum over a tetrahedra . consider a particular b tetrahedron .",

    "then @xmath94 where , for example , @xmath95    the exchange hamilton for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , @xmath96 ( [ htbex ] ) , can be split into a and b parts in a similar way , @xmath97      first we consider a simple model involving the exchange paths on a single tetrahedron ( the @xmath82th a tetrahedron ) , @xmath98 this can be represented as a @xmath99 matrix , which can be block diagonalised using the kets described in appendix  b. exact eigenfunctions can easily be found .",
    "the solutions to @xmath100 ( [ ha ] ) are the direct product ( over tetrahedra ) of the single tetrahedron solutions of @xmath101  ( [ han ] ) , which is why it is called the  independent tetrahedra model \" . because it is exactly solvable , @xmath100 is often used to model experiments instead of the full hamiltonian @xmath76 ( [ hex]).@xcite @xmath100 is a model that omits half of the exchange paths in @xmath76 , which suggests that the exchange constants of @xmath100 are approximately twice as large as those of @xmath76.@xcite we also note that @xmath100 has a lower symmetry than @xmath76 : instead of the full space group @xmath5 , it is @xmath102 , with point group @xmath47 instead of @xmath103.@xcite        when non - kramers spins are restricted to the cef ground state , the exchange interaction is greatly simplified because the matrix elements for @xmath21 vanish within this restriction .",
    "then the eigenvectors are the classical states @xmath104 .",
    "the ground state is either the doubly degenerate all - in - all - out state ( @xmath105 ) or a highly degenerate spin ice state ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this model maps to a spin-1/2 model with @xmath107 and @xmath70 .",
    "this model describes the spin ice material ho@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , but it is insufficient for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , for which higher cef levels must be included .",
    "perturbation theory is used to determine the mixing of the first excited cef level to the cef ground state manifold .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is @xmath108 ( [ hcef ] ) restricted to the cef ground and first excited states , while the exchange interaction @xmath96 ( [ htbex ] ) is the perturbation .",

    "_ however , for second order perturbation theory , we need only consider contributions to @xmath111 where one or two spins are excited because @xmath96 is bilinear in the spin operators and can only excite up to two spins at a time via the operators @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",

    "therefore this calculation reduces to a single tetrahedron hamiltonian @xmath124 .",
    "the results of the single tetrahedron calculation were found previously.@xcite by comparing a matrix representation of @xmath124 to a matrix representation of the spin-1/2 single tetrahedron @xmath101 , a map between the tb@xmath0 exchange constants and the spin-1/2 exchange constants was found .",
    "the basis functions that were used to find the matrix representations are given in appendix b ( [ astate ] - [ t2zstatehalf ] ) .",
    "here we follow a slightly different approach to the same result : instead of representing @xmath125 ( [ htbeff ] ) and @xmath126 ( [ hex ] ) in the basis given by ( [ astate ] - [ t2zstatehalf ] ) , we use the basis @xmath127 for the spin-1/2 states and the corresponding tb@xmath0 tetrahedron states determined by ( [ eq : map ] ) .",
    "the two approaches differ in the following way .",
    "when the basis ( [ astate ] - [ t2zstatehalf ] ) is used , matrix elements of the hamiltonian are real , while ( two of ) the basis functions are complex . when the @xmath128 basis is used , the basis functions are real but the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are complex .",
    "when the map ( [ eq : map ] ) is applied , the hamiltonian matrix must be complex - conjugated .      in the spin-1/2 case",
    "the following operators are replaced by the matrices : @xmath129 the product of operators associated with different sites is replaced by the kronecker product of matrices . in this way , both the full spin-1/2 exchange hamiltonian @xmath76  ( [ hex ] ) and the spin-1/2 independent tetrahedra hamiltonian @xmath100 ( [ ha ] ) can be expressed as matrices by simply using the replacements ( [ jz]-[jminus ] ) .      in order to compare the matrix representation of the tb@xmath0 exchange hamiltonian to the matrix representation of the spin-1/2 exchange hamiltonian , the basis states @xmath130 that are used to generate",
