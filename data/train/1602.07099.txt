    "the three neutrino mass and mixing scheme has been established as the standard solution to lepton flavor violation in neutrino propagation observed by various experiments .",

    ", an extensive experimental program is being developed .",
    "for example three setups have been suggested to determine sign(@xmath7 ) : i ) long baseline superbeam experiments ; ii ) medium baseline reactor experiments , juno @xcite and reno-50 @xcite and iii ) studying the energy and zenith angle dependence of atmospheric neutrinos by giant neutrino detectors such as pingu @xcite or ino @xcite .",

    "the state - of - the - art dune @xcite and t2hk @xcite long baseline experiments which employ conventional superbeams from pion decay will be the champions to determine the value of @xmath1 .",

    "this experiment is called moment which stands for muon - decay medium baseline neutrino beam .",
    "the goal of moment is also measuring the cp - violating phase @xcite . in @xcite , the potential of moment for determining @xmath1 , the octant of @xmath4 and",
    "the mass ordering has been discussed and it is shown that the results of moment combined with those of no@xmath9a and t2k can help to rule out wrong solutions and dramatically reduce uncertainties .",

    "new physics can give rise to new interaction of neutrinos with matter fields @xcite which in turn leads to modification of propagation of neutrinos in matter .",
    "in fact , the analysis of solar neutrino provides a 2 @xmath10 hint in favor of nsi @xcite . since we can not rule out the existence of such new physics before experiments are carried out @xcite , it is imperative to reexamine the discovery potential of these setups @xcite in the presence of nsi .",
    "@xcite shows that the claimed preference for @xmath12 in the present data can be mimicked by neutrino nsi even if cp is conserved in the neutrino sector ( _ i.e. , _ even if both @xmath1 and the phases of new neutrino couplings vanish ) .",
