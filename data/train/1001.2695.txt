    "the density of states ( dos ) measured by tunneling experiments in the @xmath6 ( ybco ) family of high temperature superconductors is complicated .",
    "several experiments on superconducting samples have measured densities of states with multiple energy scales.@xcite some experiments find a subgap feature@xcite while others do not,@xcite and all experiments near optimal doping find satellite features at energies larger than the gap energy . many of these studies find that the spectra change qualitatively with doping and can vary significantly at different points on the sample surface.@xcite spectral features have been interpreted in terms of band structure,@xcite competing order,@xcite and coupling to bosonic modes.@xcite    in this work , we explore reasons why the ybco single - particle spectrum is so complicated , particularly when compared to that of the related superconductor @xmath5 ( bscco).@xcite in bscco , there is a clear @xmath7-wave - like gap in the density of states , and it has been possible to reproducibly extract detailed information about the band structure@xcite and superconducting state.@xcite at present , there is no consensus on how to interpret the tunneling dos in ybco . in this work",
    ", we focus on two specific structural differences between bscco and ybco , namely that ybco is a polar material while bscco is not , and that ybco has metallic one - dimensional cuo chains while bscco does not .",
    "we show that the confluence of these two factors explains some features of the experimentally - measured dos .",
    "in particular , our results suggest that some features that were previously thought to indicate charge - ordering actually come from peculiarities of the ybco band structure .",
    "the polarity of the ybco unit cell is important for several reasons . unlike bscco",
    ", ybco has no natural cleavage plane ( i.e.  no plane along which ionic forces vanish ) , making it difficult to prepare surfaces that are clean enough for experiments .",
    "more importantly for this work , there is a charge transfer between ybco surfaces as a result of the electric fields generated by the polar unit cell .",
    "this charge transfer leads to the formation of surface states that can differ significantly from states in the bulk .",
    "in contrast , it is widely believed that the surface layers in bscco are representative of the bulk .",
    "surface charging in polar crystals has recently become prominent in the context of @xmath8/@xmath9 interfaces.@xcite the essential idea is that , since the opposite faces of a polar unit cell have opposite charge , there is a potential difference between them . in a thin film ,",
    "the potential difference between the top and bottom surfaces of the film is equal to the potential difference across a single unit cell times the number of unit cells spanning the film .",
    "the potential difference between the surfaces of the film is thus proportional to the film thickness , much like a parallel plate capacitor , and is typically large when the sample is more than a few unit cells thick .",
    "a `` polar catastrophe '' ( i.e.  a divergent electrostatic energy as the sample becomes macroscopically thick ) is avoided by a transfer of charge between the two surfaces .",
    "this screening charge eliminates the potential difference across the film , but changes the doping at the surfaces and leads to the formation of surface states .",
    "the existence of surface states in ybco has recently been confirmed by angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments.@xcite    the second aspect of ybco that makes it distinct from bscco is the presence of layers of one - dimensional cuo chains , in addition to the cuo@xmath2 plane bilayers .",
    "the nave view is that these chains carry charge in parallel to the cuo@xmath2 bilayers , but have little direct impact on the cuo@xmath2 layers .",
    "the chains are , therefore , generally ignored in models of ybco . for in - plane transport experiments , this point of view",
    "appears justified since it is possible to eliminate the effects of the chains ( which run parallel to the @xmath10 axis ) by measuring transport in the @xmath11-axis direction ; however , the chains are not easily disentangled from most other types of experiment . for example",
    ", @xmath12-axis currents ( perpendicular to the planes ) must pass through the cuo@xmath2 and cuo layers in series , so that the @xmath12-axis resistivity is dominated by the fermi surface mismatch between plane and chain layers.@xcite as another example , cuo chains have been argued to cause an anomalous vortex core expansion at low magnetic fields in ybco,@xcite which is connected to a small superconducting energy scale in the chains.@xcite in a similar vein , we find in this work that the effects of the chains are subtle , but are important for understanding some details of the density of states in the cuo@xmath2 layers .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the tunneling dos for a tight - binding model of ybco that is based on recent experimental arpes measurements of the band structure",
    ". there have , over the years , been many attempts to measure the ybco spectrum using arpes but , for reasons discussed above ,",
    "it is difficult to do reliably . some of the first successful measurements were made by schabel et al,@xcite who found a complicated set of bands , not all of which could be easily related to bands predicted by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "later work by lu et al@xcite identified an anisotropic spectrum consistent with the presence of cuo chains , and measurements in @xmath13 confirmed the existence of a pair of chain fermi surfaces in that material.@xcite recent experiments by zabolotnyy et al,@xcite and nakayama et al@xcite mapped out the fermi surfaces of the surface states in some detail .",
    "most recently okawa et al@xcite have succeeded in imaging states in the bulk , and were able to partially map the fermi surface and superconducting gap near the middle of the brillouin zone .",
    "the goal of this work is to develop a self - consistent model for surface and bulk states in y@xmath0ca@xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , and to use this model to understand details of the tunneling dos .",
    "we remark that ybco is sufficiently three - dimensional that it is not possible to model surface states by considering a single isolated cuo@xmath2 layer , as is frequently done to model bscco .",
    "instead , we develop a model for a @xmath12-axis oriented film of thickness @xmath14 unit cells .",
    "the approach we take is phenomenological . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we develop a model hamiltonian for ybco from least - squares fits of a tight - binding dispersion to the surface states measured in ref .  .",
    "we focus on optimal and overdoped ybco , where we hope to avoid complications arising from competing phases or quantum critical points .",
    "the arpes spectrum gives us the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dispersion curves for the surface states ; we assume that these dispersions are rigid , meaning that dispersions for bulk cuo@xmath2 layers may be obtained by shifting the surface dispersions up or down in energy .",
    "this process allows us to infer the structure of the bulk bands based on the measured surface states .",
    "we find that the inferred bands agree with the measured bulk fermi surface from ref .  .",
    "we then perform self - consistent calculations for the electrostatic potential in a finite - thickness film ; this gives us the band - bending profile near the surfaces .",
    "we add superconductivity to the cuo@xmath2 layers by hand , using a phenomenological relationship between the magnitude of the order parameter and the charge density . in this way",
    ", it is found that the order parameter is smaller on cuo@xmath2-terminated surfaces than in the bulk .",
    "finally , we calculate the superconducting dos and normal state spectral functions for both surface and bulk layers . we discuss the results of these calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] . in this section ,",
    "we conclude that , unlike in bscco , the density of states is sensitive to details of the band structure , and that these details naturally explain some of the features seen experimentally .     unit cells thick , and each unit cell contains two superconducting cuo@xmath2 and one metallic cuo layer , for a total of @xmath15 conducting layers .",

    "the total number of conducting layers is therefore @xmath15 .",
    "experimentally , it is known that ybco cleaves at the bao layer , so that the top conducting layer may be either a cuo chain layer or a cuo@xmath2 plane layer . to study both cases , we assume that the first layer ( @xmath17 ) is composed of cuo chains , and the last layer ( @xmath18 ) is a cuo@xmath2 plane .    of the three nonconducting layers , two ( the bao layers ) are nominally neutral and are not explicitly considered in the model .",

    "[ fig : simpledos ] ) is thus due to the weak hybridization of the surfaces chains with the underlying cuo@xmath2 planes . in the bulk ,",
    "the chain dos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simpledos ] has a main gap of about 20 mev , and a small gap of about 4 mev .",
    "the small gap originates from sections of the chain fermi surface that are only weakly coupled to the planes ( namely , @xmath136 ) while the large gap comes from sections of the fermi surface that are strongly coupled to the planes ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the small gap was discussed previously as a possible source for the subgap structure measured in some tunneling experiments.@xcite    having discussed general features of the dos and spectral function , we now discuss how these are affected by changes in specific model parameters .",
    "first , we allow for the possibility that the surface layers of the ybco thin film are doped by the adsorption of atoms or molecules onto the surfaces .",
    "adsorption happens naturally , for example , when ybco is exposed to air , and deliberate potassium adsorption has been used to control the electron concentration in cuo@xmath2 surface states.@xcite in this work , we are interested in the possibility that the adsorbate layers partially screen the electric fields at the ybco surfaces .",
    "we model this by assuming that the adsorbed layer has an average charge density of @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) at the cuo@xmath2 ( cuo ) surface , where @xmath140 . in our self - consistent calculations ,",
    "the effect of the adsorbate charge is to reduce the charge transfer between the chain and plane surfaces .    .",
    "columns are for ( a ) plane and ( b ) chain dos , ( c ) plane and ( d ) chain spectral function .",
    "the adsorbate layer has a 2d charge density of @xmath138 for the cuo@xmath2 surface and @xmath139 for the cuo surface .",
    "rows correspond to @xmath141 , 0.1 , 0.15 , and 0.2 ( top to bottom ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig : surfacecharge_1 ] shows the effect of @xmath142 on the density of states and spectral function .",
    "we see that even a relatively small adsorbate charge density has a significant effect on both @xmath126 and @xmath121 at the surfaces .",
    "in particular , @xmath126 and @xmath121 at the surfaces are increasingly similar to the bulk as @xmath142 increases .",
    "this follows directly from the fact that the charge densities at the surfaces approach their bulk values as @xmath142 increases . in the cuo@xmath2 layers , this results in a larger @xmath43 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : simple_gap ] ) , while in the cuo layers , this results in an increased hybridization between the surface chains and the adjacent cuo@xmath2 plane .",
    "the cuo@xmath2 spectrum for @xmath143 shown in fig .  [ fig : surfacecharge_1 ] is consistent with existing tunneling experiments on optimally - doped ybco . for this case , we obtain coherence peaks at the cuo@xmath2 surface at @xmath144  mev and a satellite peak at @xmath145  mev , in approximate agreement with refs .",
    "( when comparing with experiments , recall that a peak at negative energy in the dos corresponds to a peak at positive voltage bias in a tunneling experiment ) .",
    "we note that having a charged adsorbate layer is not the only way to obtain agreement with experiments ; a different value for the dielectric constant , for example , will affect the surface charge density , and consequently the dos . whether or not our model is correct in all details",
    ", it demonstrates that existing tunneling measurements on optimally - doped ybco can be explained within a band picture .",
    "columns are for ( a ) plane and ( b ) chain dos and ( c ) plane and ( d ) chain spectral function .",
    "the adsorbate charge density is @xmath146 .",
    "rows correspond to @xmath147 ( top to bottom ) . ]    throughout this work , we have assumed that the plane - chain coupling parameter is @xmath148  mev .",
    "this is the hardest of the model parameters to establish , and was chosen because it gives reasonable results for @xmath126 and @xmath121 .",
    "figure [ fig : tpc_2 ] shows the effect of varying @xmath23 on the density of states and spectral function .",
    "not surprisingly , chain - plane coupling has little effect on the dos at the cuo@xmath2 surface , apart from a shift of a weak negative - energy satellite peak away from the fermi energy with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , the chain surface is strongly influenced by coupling to the cuo@xmath2 layer ; the cuo chains are metallic when @xmath149 , and an induced gap appears when @xmath23 is nonzero .",
    "the induced gap grows approximately linearly with @xmath23 and has both a subgap and a main gap , as discussed earlier .",

    "rows are for @xmath151 ( top to bottom ) . ]    finally , we look more closely at the effects of ca doping . in ngai",
    "et al,@xcite samples with up to 20% ca substitution for y were studied , while in yeh et al@xcite , 30% ca - doped samples were studied . in fig .",
    "[ fig : change_ca ] , we show a series of calculations for the surface dos of a y@xmath0ca@xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath106 thin film .",
    "results are shown for both @xmath153 and @xmath143 .",
    "the corresponding spectral functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpes ] .    as discussed above ,",
    "the dos exhibits subgap , main gap , and satellite features . in ngai",
    "et al , the three features were attributed to superconductivity on different regions of the fermi surface .",
    "this is generally consistent with our findings here although we have found it difficult to attribute some satellite peaks to specific fermi surface elements .",
    "experimentally , the ratio between the satellite , main gap , and subgap energies was found to be approximately constant as a function of ca doping , and this was argued to show that there is a common pairing mechanism for all three features . in our model the energies of the satellite and subgap features in fig .",
    "[ fig : change_ca ] also scale with the main gap .    in some cases ,",
    "our calculations reproduce the detailed structure of the experimental spectra . for @xmath127 ,",
    "ngai et al showed two types of spectrum .",
    "the first is remarkably similar to that shown for @xmath127 in fig .",
    "[ fig : change_ca](c ) , having pronounced coherence peaks and satellite features resembling shoulders .",
    "spectra of this type are also measured in optimally - doped ( @xmath110 ) samples.@xcite the good agreement between our calculations and the measured spectra suggests that our model captures the essential physics of the surface states in optimally - doped ybco .",
    "the second type of measured spectrum qualitatively resembles that shown for @xmath154 in fig .",
    "[ fig : change_ca](d ) , having weak coherence peaks , a subgap feature , and satellite peaks ( indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : change_ca ] ) .",
    "however , there is a discrepancy between our calculations and the experiments ; at higher ca doping levels , the measured spectra continue to exhibit three sets of peaks while the satellite peaks in our calculations become less prominent .",
    "given the sensitivity of the dos to small changes in the model parameters , it is plausible that this discrepancy can be corrected by small changes to the model .",
    "it is also possible that extrinsic effects not considered here , for example tunneling matrix elements that emphasize the @xmath130 and @xmath155 regions of the brillouin zone,@xcite could increase the prominence of the satellite features in tunneling experiments .",
    "however , we also can not rule out the possibility that our simple model for ca substitution is overly nave .",
    "another feature of the dos that is not explained by our model is the large residual dos measured experimentally ; the dos is never seen to vanish at @xmath134 in the superconducting state , and is often 50% of the normal state dos .",
    "it is not clear whether the residual dos is intrinsic ( for example , due to pair breaking at the surface ) or extrinsic ( coming from surface states in an adsorbate layer ) .",
    "it is possible that a full description of the ybco surface states will require a proper accounting of this residual dos .",
    "we have studied the surface and bulk states of y@xmath0ca@xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath106 with @xmath156 within a tight - binding model .",
    "the model parameters for the cuo@xmath2 planes are extracted from photoemission experiments , and self - consistent calculations are used to relate the surface and bulk states .",
    "we have calculated the density of states @xmath126 and spectral function @xmath129 as functions of adsorbed surface charge density , chain - plane coupling , and ca doping .",
    "our main findings are that    * our model produces results which are in simultaneous agreement with surface and bulk arpes measurements .",
    "this supports two key assumptions of the model , that the surface and bulk bands are connected by a simple chemical potential shift and that the coulomb potential can be treated in a planar approximation . * the dos in optimally - doped ybco",
    "can be quantitatively explained by our model .",
    "in particular , shoulders measured in the density of states that were previously attributed to pairing or to competing order are found to be band structure effects . *",
    "the superconducting dos is sensitive to small changes in the model parameters .",
    "this suggests that , in materials with cuo chains , small changes in doping of the surface states can have a qualitative effect on the density of states , purely as a result of changes to the band structure .",
    "this should be contrasted with bscco where it is believed that the doping dependence of the dos is primarily due to strong correlations .",
    "* we can understand some features of ca - doped ybco ; for example , our calculations find densities of states at the chain surface with subgap , main gap , and satellite features similar to experiments .",
    "however , we have not understood the dependence of this spectrum on ca concentration .",
