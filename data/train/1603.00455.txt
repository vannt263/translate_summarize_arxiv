    "the second step is to find the translation and rotation that minimize the reduced @xmath251 ( @xmath252 is defined as the separation of the matches divided by the total positional uncertainty ) for @xmath253 matches that have the smallest values of @xmath252 . here",
    "@xmath254 represents the percentage of the matches used to calculate the @xmath251 and is adopted to exclude possible spurious or bad matches .",

    "we have assumed @xmath255 throughout the paper .",
    "the translation and rotation obtained for the astrometric correction have uncertainties , increasing the positional uncertainties of the aligned sources .",
    "we estimated the additional positional uncertainties of the aligned sources associated with the astrometric correction procedure , based on 200 simulations . in each simulation , we first simulated the positions of the sources that have matches around the positions of the matches in the reference frame , with positional uncertainties following the combined positional uncertainties from the reference frame and the frame to be aligned .",
    "then the @xmath251 minimization for the @xmath253 matches that have the smallest values of @xmath252 was repeated . the corrected positions for each source from the simulations",
    "are then used to calculate the uncertainty associated with the astrometric correction , which is added to the original positional uncertainty of the source in quadrature ."

    "<S> we report the discovery of an off - nuclear ultrasoft hyper - luminous x - ray source candidate 3xmm  j141711.1 + 522541 in the inactive s0 galaxy sdss  j141711.07 + 522540.8 ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 gpc ) in the extended groth strip . </S>",
    "<S> it is located at a projected offset of @xmath210 ( 5.2 kpc ) from the nucleus of the galaxy and was serendipitously detected in five _ xmm - newton _ observations in 2000 july . </S>",
    "<S> two observations have enough counts and can be fitted with a standard thermal disk with an apparent inner disk temperature @xmath3 kev and a 0.2814.2 kev unabsorbed luminosity @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 in the source rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the source was still detected in three _ chandra _ observations in 2002 august , with similarily ultrasoft but fainter spectra ( @xmath6 kev , @xmath7 erg  s@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was not detected in later observations , including two by _ chandra _ in 2005 october , one by _ </S>",
    "<S> xmm - newton _ in 2014 january , and two by _ chandra _ in 2014 september  october , implying a long - term flux variation factor of @xmath814 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the source could be a transient with an outburst in 20002002 . </S>",
    "<S> it has a faint optical counterpart candidate , with apparent magnitudes of @xmath9 ab mag and @xmath10 ab mag in 2004 december ( implying an absolute @xmath11-band magnitude of @xmath2@xmath12 ab mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss various explanations for the source and find that it is best explained as a massive black hole ( bh ) embedded in the nucleus of a possibly stripped satellite galaxy , with the x - ray outburst due to tidal disruption of a surrounding star by the bh . </S>",
    "<S> the bh mass is @xmath13 , assuming the peak x - ray luminosity at around the eddington limit . </S>"
