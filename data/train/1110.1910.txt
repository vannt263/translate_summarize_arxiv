    "the large hadron collider will collide protons with planned bunch spacing of 25 nanoseconds and center - of - mass energy of 14 tev . at an instantanous luminosity of @xmath6 @xmath2 s@xmath3 , each collision on average produces 75 minimum - bias interactions that result in high detector occupancy and",
    "create a challenging environment for event readout and reconstruction .",
    "on one hand , limited data store bandwidth demands a significant online rate reduction of 5 - 6 orders of magnitude . on the other hand , events with interesting physics signatures must be selected very efficiently from the vast lhc background .",
    "the primary role of the trigger system in the atlas experiment is to search for interesting but extremely rare processes in proton collisions at the lhc that are hidden in much larger background levels and initiate an archive of detector data for such processes .",
    "only a tiny fraction of the produced collisions can be stored on tape and an enormous real - time data reduction is needed .",
    "this requires massive computational power to minimize the online execution time of complex algorithms .",
    "a multi - level trigger is an effective solution for an otherwise intractable problem .",
    "the rate of recorded events is limited to about 300 hz due to technology and resource limitations .",
    "since the proton - proton interaction rate at design luminosity is 1 ghz , the trigger must maintain an overall rejection factor of 5 million against minimum - bias processes while retaining maximum efficiency for the new physics sought by atlas .",
    "the level-1 ( lvl1 ) trigger system uses a subset of the total detector information to make a decision in less than 2.5 microseconds regarding whether or not to continue processing an event , reducing the data rate to approximately 75 khz ( limited by the detector readout system , which is upgradeable to 100 khz ) .",
    "the level-2 ( lvl2 ) and event filter ( ef ) together form the high - level trigger ( hlt ) .",
    "they provide the reduction to a final data - taking rate of approximately 300 hz .",
    "the lvl1 trigger is implemented using custom electronics , while the hlt is almost entirely based on commercially available computers and networking hardware .",
    "the lvl1 trigger searches for signatures from high pt muons , electrons / photons , jets , and -leptons decaying into hadrons",
    ". it also selects topologies with large missing transverse energy ( @xmath7 ) and large total transverse energy @xmath8 .",
    "the lvl1 trigger uses reduced - granularity information from a subset of detectors : the resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) and thin - gap chambers ( tgc ) for high pt muons , and all the calorimeter sub - systems for electromagnetic clusters , jets , @xmath5-leptons , @xmath7 , and large @xmath8 .",
    "the lvl1 decision time must be less than 2.5 microseconds given the maximum readout rate of 75 khz .",
    "although adding tracking information at this stage would be extremely beneficial to discern certain physics objects , it is not currently possible given the small timing window ( 2.5 @xmath9 ) available to lvl1 .",
    "moreover , even projected cpu farms that constitute the lvl2 trigger can not perform global track reconstruction within their time budget of approximately 10 ms",
    ". instead , at lvl2 does limited tracking inside regions of interest ( roi ) identified by the lvl1 trigger .",
    "these are regions of the detector where the lvl1 trigger has identified lvl1 trigger objects of interest within the event .",
    "the lvl2 trigger uses roi information on coordinates , energy , and type of signatures to limit the amount of data that must be transferred from the detector readout .",
    "it uses dedicated algorithms to analyze full - granularity and full - precision data from all detectors .",
    "the lvl2 trigger reduces the event rate to below 3.5 khz , with an average event processing time of approximately 10 milliseconds .",
    "the ef uses offline analysis procedures on complete events to further select events down to a rate that can be recorded for subsequent offline analysis .",
    "it reduces the event rate to approximately 300 hz , with an average event processing time of order one second .",
    "an important lesson from past experience at high - luminosity hadron collider experiments is that controlling trigger rates can be extremely challenging as the luminosity increases , physics goals change in response to new discoveries , and the detector ages .",
    "it is thus essential that the trigger system be flexible and robust , with sufficient redundancy and operating margin . providing high quality track reconstruction over the full atlas detector by the start of processing in the lvl2 computer farm is an important element in achieving these goals",
    "this has certainly been the case in cdf run ii , where the availability of near offline - quality tracks at the trigger hardware level using chamber and silicon hit information has significantly extended the physics capabilities of the experiment ( e.g. triggering on displaced tracks which are rich in @xmath4-hadron decays ) .    as the instantaneous luminosity increases ,",
    "the trigger task becomes more difficult since the signal rates grow linearly but the background rates grow more quickly . at @xmath6 @xmath2 s@xmath3 ,",
    "each bunch crossing contains  75 pile - up interactions ( on average ) that need to be distinguished by the trigger from a hard scattering processing of interest .",
    "the computational load on the lvl2 system will significantly increase due to both the need for more sophisticated algorithms to suppress backgrounds and more rois to process .",
    "until the new physics processes that will be seen at the lhc are known , it is not obvious how to best deal with this challenge since we do not know the momentum scale of the trigger objects that need to be considered or what mix of lepton , jets , and @xmath7 in the trigger menu will be optimal . increasing",
    "the amount of information available at the start of lvl2 processing through early track reconstruction will enhance the trigger flexibility needed during high luminosity lhc running .",
    "we can reasonably expect third - generation fermions to play an important role in lhc physics given central role that mass plays in electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "an example of the utility of early track reconstruction is the selection of events containing third - generation fermions , either a @xmath4-quark or a @xmath5-lepton . for @xmath4-quarks",
    ", the lvl1 trigger selects a generic jet . for hadronic",
    "@xmath10-lepton decays , the lvl1 trigger selects a narrow jet .",
    "the challenge comes from the enormous background from qcd produced light quark and gluon jets , which can be suppressed using tracking information .",
    "tracks coming from a secondary vertex or not pointing to beamline identify @xmath4-quark jets , while @xmath5 jets ( from hardronic @xmath5 decays ) .",
    "while we do not yet know what nature has in store for the lhc , we do know that efficient triggering on final states involving electrons , muons , missing transverse energy ( met ) , and/or @xmath11-generation fermions will be crucial for achieving the physics goals of the atlas experiment .",
    "bottom quarks and @xmath5-leptons produce very specific tracking signatures which can be exploited in triggering . at high luminosity ,",
    "sophisticated algorithms run at lvl2 will be needed to suppress backgrounds . in the current system ,",
    "the lvl2 farm is burdened with reconstructing tracks with the rois .",
    "also , global tracking will be important for maintaining reasonable trigger rates and signal efficiency at high interaction pile - up ( large luminosity ) .",
    "in particular , the use of primary vertexing and subsequent charged lepton association for improved isolation will improve hadronic jet background rejection . with global tracking , we can also use @xmath4-decay events with final state hadrons identified outside of rois and construct additional combined triggers ( e.g. lepton + track ) .",
    "finally , it is possible to construct track - based met and jet objects , possibly combined with calorimeter information , that utilize primary vertexing to maintain stable and efficient triggering under high luminosity running conditions .",
    "we describe a system to enable early rejection of background events and more lvl2 execution time for sophisticated algorithms by moving track reconstruction into a hardware system ( ftk )  @xcite with massively - parallel processing that produces global track reconstruction with nearly offline resolution close to the start of lvl2 processing .",
    "the ftk system is inspired by the success of the silicon vertex trigger ( svt )  @xcite in the cdf detector .",
    "ftk operates in parallel with the normal silicon detector readout following each lvl1 trigger and reconstructs tracks over the entire detector volume ( up to @xmath12 of 2.5 ) in under a millisecond .",
    "having tracks available by the beginning of lvl2 processing allows reduced lvl1 @xmath13 thresholds since the lvl2 trigger is able to reject non - interesting events more quickly .",
    "furthermore , since the lvl2 system is freed of it heavy tracking load , the extra processing time becomes available for more advanced online algorithms .      in order to perform tracking with good efficiency and resolution ,",
    "ftk uses data from the two inner - most subsystems of the atlas inner detector  @xcite .",
    "pixel sensors provide a two - dimensional measurement of hit position and include over 80 million readout channels .",
    "sct layers are arranged in pairs of axial and narrow - angle stereo strips and consist of 6 million channels . a typical track passes through 11 detector layers and",
    "can be reconstructed from the 14 coordinate measurements ( @xmath14 from two - dimensional pixels and @xmath15 from sct ) .",
    "custom designed splitters duplicate data output by the sct and pixel readout drivers ( rods ) and send it to ftk . since ftk non - invasively eavesdrops on the inner detector data , it easily integrates with the current atlas trigger system ( fig .",
    "[ trigger_system ] ) .        in order to increase the overall throughput of the system ,",
    "ftk splits incoming data into 8 or more _ regions _ in @xmath16 with sufficient overlap to account for inefficiencies at the edges .",
    "each region is served by a separate crate that consists of the subsystems shown in fig .",
    "[ data_flow ] . raw pixel and sct data",
    "are first received by the data formatter that uses fast fpga s to perform clustering  @xcite . clustered hits",
    "proceed into one of six data organizers depending on which of six @xmath17 towers the hits reside , where they are buffered and merged into coarse superstrips to be used in pattern recognition .",
    "the superstrips are then sent into a pipelined array of associative memory ( am ) that perform fast pattern finding using a pre - calculated table of particle trajectories .",
    "matched patterns are reconnected with their corresponding full - resolution hits in their corresponding data organizer and sent to the track fitters . after removal of duplicate tracks , with each phi - region a read - out buffer ( rob ) is associated that receives the track data ( formatted as a rod fragment ) .",
    "the robs transfer the output on request to the lvl2 trigger .",
    "luminosities above @xmath18 combined with 86 million readout channels create a unique combinatorial challenge for tracking .",
    "ftk overcomes this with the help of specialized am hardware that implements a massive , ultra - fast lookup table that enumerates all realistic particle trajectories ( patterns ) through the 11 detector layers  @xcite . in order to keep the size of the trajectory lookup under control ,",
    "detector hits are merged into coarse - resolution _ superstrips _ having a width of a few millimeters .",
    "the pattern bank is precalculated either from single track monte - carlo or from real data events ( fig .",
    "[ am_bank](a ) ) and stored in the am .",
    "each pattern in the am includes its own comparison logic .",
    "when hits from a given event enter the am , they are simultaneously compared with millions of pre - stored patterns . in order to account for inefficiencies in individual detector layers , ftk also matches patterns with one missing layer ( fig .",
    "[ am_bank](b ) ) .",
    "ftk computes five track helix parameters ( curvature , @xmath19 etc ) and a @xmath20 quality of fit from the _ full resolution _ hits within each matched pattern .",
    "since patterns are constructed from reduced - granularity superstrips , multiple full - resolution hits can belong to a given superstrip .",
    "this results in some ambiguity , which is resolved by fitting all combinations within the superstrips .",
    "performing full @xmath20 minimization with respect to five parameters is an extremely slow procedure .",
    "instead , ftk reduces the track fitting problem to a set of scalar products , which can be computed efficiently using dsp units in modern commercial fpga s .",
    "this is done by arranging geometrically similar patterns into a number of groups ( called _ sectors _ ) , so that within each sector the relationship between hit positions ( @xmath21 ) and track parameters ( @xmath22 ) is approximately linear : @xmath23 the fitting coefficients for each sector are precomputed from the same training data that was used in pattern generation .",
    "an added advantage of this approach is that when real detector hits are used in training , misalignments and other detector effects are automatically taken into account .",
    "overall , the linearized approach allows ftk to achieve near - offline resolution as shown in figure  [ resol ] , with a fitting rate of about 1 fit per nanosecond .     1 gev in @xmath24 ( @xmath25 )",

    "an important consideration the ftk design is the execution time for typical events at high luminosity .",
    "the expected execution time of the current atlas trigger system and the ftk system for @xmath24 events simulated at @xmath6 @xmath2 s@xmath3 was evaluated .",
    "the preliminary results are that while the current system requires @xmath26 msec per jet roi ( and there will be several of these per event at an realistic jet @xmath8 threshold ) , global tracking of the entire detector can be done by the ftk system in @xmath27sec per event for a track @xmath28 threshold of 1 gev .",
