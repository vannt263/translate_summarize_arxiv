    "photon and electron induced reactions provide a useful tool to probe particle properties in the nuclear medium . in the nucleon resonance region ,",
    "meson production can be used to learn about the in - medium properties of nucleon resonances . among other processes , measurements of eta photoproduction",
    "were performed @xcite in order to obtain information about the @xmath3 .",
    "this channel is particularly interesting because of the strong coupling between the eta and the @xmath3 in the energy region from the @xmath4 threshold up to invariant masses of about 1.6 gev . in photoproduction",
    "the momentum transfer and the mass of the created resonance are directly related to each other : in the vacuum , a @xmath5 with pole - mass of @xmath6 gev can only be excited by a real photon with energy @xmath7 gev ; inside the nucleus this condition is somewhat softened due to fermi motion .",
    "only recently , we have calculated @xmath8 photoproduction on different nuclei in the region of the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the available data is good when a momentum dependent resonance potential is applied .",
    "we have found collisional broadening for the @xmath5 of only about 30 mev that had almost no visible effect on the cross section .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see whether this holds over a larger range of resonance momenta . for a review of",
    "photon induced processes within our model we refer to @xcite .    in electroproduction experiments ,",
    "the electron interacts with the nucleus by the exchange of a single virtual photon ( one - photon exchange approximation ) .",
    "this yields an additional degree of freedom , because photon energy and momentum can now be chosen independently from each other .",
    "therefore , the resonance self energy can be probed over a full range of mass and momentum .",
    "electroproduction of mesons in the resonance region at low @xmath9 gev@xmath1 was already addressed in the framework of the coupled - channel buu model in @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of electron induced processes is the decrease of the cross sections with increasing @xmath2 . especially the resonant structure becomes less pronounced due to the @xmath2 dependence of the photocoupling helicity amplitudes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , fermi motion becomes the more effective the larger @xmath2 is @xcite , resulting in a smearing of the resonant structure over a wide energy range and an even stronger decrease of the cross section maxima .    in this work",
    "we calculate eta electroproduction on nuclei within a semi - classical coupled - channel buu transport model ; the same model was used in @xcite to calculate photon induced eta production . in this work ,",
    "we investigate eta production mechanisms in electroproduction in the kinematical regime accessible at jlab and compare with findings from eta photoproduction .",
    "this makes it possible to study the transition from low resonance momenta at @xmath10 to larger momenta at @xmath11 gev@xmath1 , i.e. probing the momentum regime of a pole - mass resonance from 0.8 gev up to more than 3 gev .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly discuss the buu model , our approach to the @xmath12 reaction and the treatment of the final state interactions ( fsi ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we qualitatively compare differences between eta photo- and electroproduction .",
    "we treat the electron - nucleus reaction in the one - photon exchange approximation .",
    "therefore , the process can be described in the same way as in photoproduction .",
    "the model then contains two aspects : the reaction of the ( virtual ) photon with the nucleus and the treatment of the final state interactions ( fsi ) .      for the elementary reaction",
    ", we assume that the photon is absorbed by a single nucleon . in the nucleon resonance region",
    "the relevant processes are @xmath13 for photoproduction , also the @xmath14 has to be taken into account @xcite , but the helicity amplitude of this resonance decreases rather quickly with increasing @xmath2 @xcite , especially compared to the @xmath5 , so that its contribution to the second resonance region becomes small for @xmath15 gev@xmath1 . moreover , the @xmath16 couples only very weakly , if at all , to the eta @xcite . as an input for our model , we need cross sections for the different channels displayed in ( [ eq : elem_reactions ] ) . unlike the case of photoproduction , where a large body of data can be exploited @xcite , at finite @xmath2 only few processes have been measured .",
    "we present calculations for @xmath0 and 3.6 gev@xmath1 , because we then can use the recently measured cross sections for the primary reaction @xmath17 by armstrong _",
    "we assume that in the considered energy regime the reaction proceeds by the excitation and subsequent decay of a @xmath3 resonance ; background contributions are negligible @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use a breit - wigner parametrization similar to that applied in eta photoproduction @xcite : @xmath18 with @xmath19 and the total and partial resonance widths @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for the latter two we use the parametrizations from @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the photon center of mass ( cm ) momentum and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the resonance pole mass . the transversal photocoupling helicity amplitude @xmath25 is determined from the fit to the exclusive data in @xcite ; it thus contains the form factor of the resonance . the longitudinal contribution to the resonant cross section",
    "is neglected , which is a reasonable assumption @xcite .",
    "the obtained values are shown in tab . [",
    "tab : helicity - ampl ] and are in line with the findings in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_proton ] we show the parametrization in comparison with the data .",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "note that the energy dependence of the curves is strongly influenced by the energy parametrization of the resonance widths .",
    "it is not sufficient to account only for this direct process , because via the fsi all other elementary channels may contribute to eta production .",
    "due to the absence of data for the other exclusive channels in ( [ eq : elem_reactions ] ) it is difficult to determine the respective contributions unambiguously . for the total cross section",
    "@xmath26 we make use of the data compilation by brasse _",
    "the cross section @xmath27 can be obtained from ( [ eq : gamma_proton_eta ] ) by substituting the partial decay width in the numerator with the total width : @xmath28 the remaining resonance contributions of the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 are determined by making breit - wigner parametrizations according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_proton_eta ] ) .",
    "the used transversal helicity amplitudes are also displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab : helicity - ampl ] .",
    "the @xmath31 amplitudes are close to those cited in @xcite . for the @xmath32 much larger values ( factor of @xmath33 ) were necessary in order to saturate the whole resonant structure in the third resonance region suggested by the inclusive data in @xcite .",
    "the background contributions @xmath34 and @xmath35 were fixed by absorbing the remaining strength after summing all contributions incoherently to the total cross section .    in the neutron sector , there is no experimental information at all .",
    "therefore , we use the same cross sections as for the protons , except for the channel @xmath36 . here",
    "we use , as in photoproduction , the relation @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that the data situation does not allow a more refined separation of the total cross section into the different channels . on the other hand ,",
    "the very important primary eta source @xmath38 is well under control and the total cross section also is described by our parametrization .",
    "moreover , the details of the separation of strength into the different pionic channels do not influence the more qualitative issues we will discuss in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the vacuum cross sections @xmath39 discussed so far are connected to the experimentally measured cross sections for the electron - nucleon reaction . using the hand convention @xcite ,",
    "we have @xmath40 here @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the energies of the incoming and outgoing electrons and the degree of longitudinal polarization of the virtual photons , respectively .",
    "@xmath44 refers to the scattering angle of the electrons in the lab frame and @xmath45 denotes the equivalent photon momentum , where @xmath46 is the cm energy of the @xmath47 pair .    in order to measure the excitation function of the @xmath3 as a function of the photon energy at fixed",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath2 , one has to vary the electron scattering angle and the energy of identified outgoing electrons .",
    "the eta data on the proton @xcite were obtained at fixed electron scattering angle , so that actually a certain finite @xmath2 range was covered .",
    "this was accounted for by correcting the data accordingly .",
    "we use electron energies @xmath48 and 4 gev for @xmath0 and 3.6 gev@xmath1 , respectively , as in @xcite .",
    "the nucleons are distributed in the nucleus according to a woods - saxon distribution .",
    "we apply the local density approximation with local fermi momenta to generate the momentum distribution if the nucleons . for the binding of the nucleons we use a density and momentum dependent potential described in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the kinematics of the nucleons and hence the cm energy of the initial photon - nucleon pairs differ from the vacuum case .",
    "the kinematical situation in the considered processes is such that shadowing effects in the photon - nucleus reaction are negligible .",
    "the aspect of the fsi is treated within a coupled - channel buu transport model , which is based upon the buu equation .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of the phase space density @xmath49 of a certain particle type @xmath50 : @xmath51\\ ] ] the left - hand side describes the particle propagation under the influence of a hamilton function @xmath52 , which in the case of baryons includes an effective scalar potential @xmath53 . besides the nucleon , our model contains nucleon resonances and the relevant mesonic degrees of freedom @xmath54 , @xmath8 , @xmath55 , ...",
    "we use the set of 29 nucleon resonances and parameters from manley and saleski @xcite . the collisional integral on the right - hand side accounts for the coupling to the phase space densities of other particles due to reactions such as collisions , decay and resonance formation .",
    "the collision reactions are usually of binary type .",
    "the eta meson couples to the three resonances @xmath3 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "as already described above , we only account for the first of these resonances in the @xmath47 reaction .",
    "relevant fsi for eta production may be @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "the reactions at large @xmath2 with large momentum transfer in the elementary reaction involve collisions in the fsi partially with invariant masses above 2 gev . for such reactions we use the string model fritiof @xcite to determine the particle content of the final states and the kinematics .",
    "relevant final states in the considered energy range contain mainly the @xmath8 and @xmath61 along with nucleons , @xmath62 resonances and pions . for more model details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "we now present our results for the reaction @xmath63 for @xmath0 and 3.6 gev@xmath1 and compare with eta photoproduction @xmath64 .",
    "we do not take into account any medium modifications for resonances .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsi_nofsi ] we discuss the influence of the fsi on pion and eta photo- and electroproduction .",
    "first , we focus on the calculations obtained without fsi ( dashed curves ) .",
    "that is , only the effects of fermi motion , pauli blocking and nuclear binding on the elementary reaction are studied . in the case of pions",
    "( left panels ) the whole resonance region is shown .",
    "it is seen that the resonant structure , clearly visible in photoproduction , is totally washed out at larger values of @xmath2 . in particular , the peak of the first resonance region has disappeared .",
    "the remaining , flat contribution of the @xmath29 is shown as dotted curves .",
    "the behavior is caused by the strong decrease of the resonance helicity amplitudes compared to the background processes and the more effective fermi smearing at large @xmath2 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : srts_spec ] , where the the cm energy of the primary photon - nucleon pair is shown for different values of @xmath2 . here",
    "the photon energy in each case is chosen such that a cm energy of @xmath65 gev is obtained for a nucleon at rest .",
    "it is seen that the spectrum becomes very broad for @xmath11 gev@xmath1 , covering actually the whole resonance region , wheras the spectrum at @xmath10 is confined to the second resonance region .",
    "therefore , at fixed photon energy a much wider cm energy range is probed than in photoproduction .    in eta production , the resonance peak structure of the @xmath3 is visible in fig . [",
    "fig : fsi_nofsi ] for each @xmath2 value , because no other processes contribute to this channel in the absence of fsi .    when the fsi are turned on ( solid curves ) , we observe at @xmath10 , that the curves drop for both pions and etas : the particles that stem from the elementary reaction can be absorbed . in the pionic channel this happens by collisional reactions such as @xmath66 ( see @xcite ) , whereas in the eta channel this is only of small importance @xcite . here",
    "the main absorption mechanism is @xmath67 .",
    "with increasing @xmath2 , the picture changes drastically : the curves for the pions are larger than the results without fsi for photon energies @xmath68 gev . for @xmath11 gev@xmath1",
    "this happens already at the beginning of the first resonance region .",
    "the reason is that the particles stemming from the elementary reaction ( [ eq : elem_reactions ] ) are produced at larger momentum transfer ( @xmath69 gev for @xmath0 gev@xmath1 and @xmath70 gev for @xmath11 gev@xmath1 on top of the @xmath5 resonance peak ) .",
    "therefore the background pions and decay products of the resonances are capable of producing even more particles in the fsi .",
    "this effect is missing in photoproduction , where the pion kinetic energies are not large enough at lower photon energies .",
    "the result is that the particle loss by absorption , which is of course also present at finite @xmath2 , becomes dominant .    in eta production",
    "we observe the same effect .",
    "for the higher @xmath2 values the curves with and without fsi lie essentially on top of each other in the threshold region . for @xmath11 gev@xmath1",
    "the effect is even more pronounced .",
    "note also that at finite @xmath2 the cross section close to the threshold is larger than in the calculations without fsi due to secondary processes .",
    "such contributions are also absent in photoproduction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : prim_sek ] we analyze the origin of the observed etas again for photo- and electroproduction .",
    "it is seen that with increasing @xmath2 the relative importance of the primarily produced etas ( from the reaction @xmath71 ) decreases .",
    "this is partially caused by the decrease of the helicity amplitudes and the fermi smearing already mentioned . on the other hand , the contribution of secondary etas produced in the fsi increase and become more important for @xmath11 gev@xmath1 .",
    "it is remarkable that the production mechanism changes to such a degree .",
    "this also influences the information content of eta production with respect to the @xmath3 properties in medium , because one is less sensitive to the resonances produced in the first reaction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contributions ] we discuss the different sources the detected eta actually stem from .",
    "the processes @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 denote etas resulting from the decay of @xmath5 resonances that were produced in such reactions .",
    "the high energy contributions denote etas resulting from baryon - baryon or baryon - meson collisions at larger energies determined by the fritiof model either directly or by the decay of @xmath5 and @xmath61 resonances produced in such events or elastic scattering at higher energies .",
    "we see that the main contribution still consists of etas that did not get absorbed and re - emitted after their first production via the @xmath5 decay .",
    "however , as already described above , at higher @xmath2 secondary processes become more important , especially the high energy contributions and reactions from @xmath76 .",
    "the latter are also responsible for the subthreshold contributions for energies below the threshold of the @xmath77 channel .",
    "we have calculated eta production in photon and electron induced reactions on nuclei for several values of @xmath2 .",
    "this is of particular interest , because at large @xmath2 the physics of the resonance region ( i.e. reactions with invariant masses below 2 gev ) is mixed with fsi at larger energies than encountered in photoproduction .",
    "we have found that the fsi mechanisms change with increasing @xmath2 from an essentially absorptive character at @xmath10 to a source of relevant contributions .",
    "this is due to the increasing momentum transfer in the elementary reaction and an opening of secondary eta production channels in the fsi .",
    "it is clear that the inclusion of such side - feeding effects is important for the interpretation of eta electroproduction in terms of possible in - medium modifications of the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the fsi also lead to an increase of the cross sections for pion and eta production .",
    "a similar effect has been seen in high - energy photo production of @xmath78 @xcite and of @xmath55 mesons @xcite on nuclei .",
