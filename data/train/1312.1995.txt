    "collinear perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) at leading twist in the operator product expansion successfully describes the quark and gluon substructure of the proton observed in high energy scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "the parton distribution functions , @xmath6 , constitute the number densities of partons of flavor @xmath7 in the proton .",
    "they depend on the partonic momentum fraction , @xmath8 , and on the momentum transfer scale , @xmath9 .",
    "two similar sets of distribution functions parametrize the spin dependent parton distributions in protons polarized either longitudinally or transversely with respect to the proton momentum direction  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinally polarized structure has been successfully described using pqcd at leading twist  @xcite .",
    "initially , transverse - single - spin asymmetries or the analyzing power ( @xmath0 ) of hadrons @xmath10 produced in the transversely polarized @xmath11 reaction were expected to be small  @xcite , but experiments instead measured large asymmetries of up to @xmath12 .",
    "these asymmetries have been measured at increasing center - of - mass energies @xmath4 over the past three decades , from 4.9 to 200  gev  @xcite , recent results from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) show that large asymmetries persist even up to @xmath13  gev  @xcite . unlike at the low to intermediate energies ,",
    "the measured unpolarized cross section at high energies is well reproduced by pqcd calculations  @xcite , indicating that unpolarized collisions can be described by the standard collinear factorized theory , while transversely polarized collisions can not .    to better describe the large @xmath0 measurements ,",
    "the theoretical framework has been extended to include transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distributions and multi - parton dynamics ( higher twist effects ) . because the intrinsic partonic transverse momentum scale is set by the mass of the proton , these effects dominate for hadrons with low momenta transverse to the beam axis , @xmath14  gev/@xmath15 .",
    "at least two tmd effects have been proposed to explain the observed nonzero asymmetries .",
    "the first of these , known as the sivers effect , correlates the proton spin with the partonic transverse momentum @xmath16",
    "it has been measured in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) experiments with sensitivity mainly to the quarks  @xcite .",
    "previous results in @xmath1+@xmath1 collisions  @xcite have been used to constrain the gluon sivers function  @xcite .",
    "recently , this function has received intense theoretical attention based on questions of universality and an expected sign change of @xmath0 in sidis compared to drell - yan production  @xcite .    a second transverse",
    "momentum dependent effect , known as the collins effect , describes the coupling of a transverse quark polarization ( transversity ) and a transverse spin dependent fragmentation from a struck quark into a hadron  @xcite .",
    "the spin dependent fragmentation part has been measured in @xmath17+@xmath18 annihilation for charged pions  @xcite and serves as input for collins asymmetries in proton scattering to access the transversity distribution  @xcite .",
    "the full integral over all partonic momenta @xmath19 of the transversity distribution can be compared to the flavor - singlet tensor charge @xmath20 , which is calculable in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "this will be a fundamental test of the theory .    at large transverse momenta the collinear",
    "higher twist effects are thought to become more important in the creation of transverse spin asymmetries  @xcite . for drell - yan production",
    "it has been shown that both initial state tmd and multi - parton dynamics provide equivalent descriptions of transverse asymmetries in an overlap region at intermediate transverse momenta  @xcite . with increasing @xmath21",
    "the asymmetries are expected to fall off and vanish in the strictly collinear regime , which has not been observed experimentally yet .",
    "it is best probed at high center - of - mass energies , where the range of transverse momenta is wider .",
    "this paper reports on measurements of @xmath0 at @xmath3 and 200  gev .",
    "the data were taken by the phenix experiment at rhic in the years 2006 ( @xmath3  gev ) and 2008 ( @xmath13  gev ) with integrated luminosities of 42  nb@xmath22 and 4.3  pb@xmath22 , respectively .",

    "the phenix midrapidity spectrometer is used to detect neutral pions and @xmath26 mesons via their decay into two photons .",
    "the spectrometer covers a pseudorapidity range of @xmath23 and is split into two approximately back - to - back arms each covering @xmath27 in azimuth .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) is highly segmented with @xmath28 .",
    "events are selected using an emcal based high tower energy trigger in coincidence with a minimum bias trigger .",
    "the trigger , digitization electronics , and details of the hardware have been discussed previously  @xcite .",
    "the trigger efficiency starts at about 5% for neutral pions with @xmath29  gev/@xmath15 and rises to and saturates at about 90% at @xmath30  gev/@xmath15 .",
    "a multi - wire proportional chamber with pad readout  @xcite is situated in front of the calorimeter face , and is used to veto charged particles .",
    "the minimum bias trigger was defined as the coincidence of signals from two beam beam counters ( bbc ) covering the full azimuthal angle and the pseudorapidity range @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the bbcs are used to reconstruct the collision time and the collision ( vertex ) position along the beam direction .",
    "each bbc is situated 144  cm from the nominal interaction point and comprises an array of 64 counters arranged around the beam pipe .",
    "each counter comprises a erenkov quartz - radiator of hexagonal cross section with a mesh dynode photomultiplier tube for read - out .",
    "the phenix muon piston calorimeter ( mpc ) is an electromagnetic calorimeter which was designed to measure photons and neutral mesons at forward - rapidity .",
    "the detector comprises two separate devices placed along the beamline to the north and to the south of the nominal interaction point , labeled n - mpc and s - mpc .",
    "the s - mpc was first installed in 2006 and the n - mpc followed a year later .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the 2006 data set ( @xmath4=62.4  gev ) uses only the s - mpc while the 2008 data set ( @xmath4=200  gev ) includes both detectors .",
    "both mpcs are located in cavities of the steel piston which is part of the phenix muon detector magnet yoke .",
    "the diameter of each cavity limits the detector s outer diameter to 45  cm , while the beampipe requires an inner diameter of no less than 8  cm ( n - mpc ) or 10  cm ( s - mpc ) .",
    "the mpcs are placed @xmath32220  cm from the nominal interaction point and are composed of 192 ( s - mpc ) or 220 ( n - mpc ) towers stacked to form an annulus around the beampipe .",
    "the detector acceptance covers the full azimuthal angle and a pseudorapidity range of @xmath33 south and @xmath34 north of the nominal interaction point .",
    "each tower combines a pbwo@xmath35 scintillating crystal wrapped with tyvek@xmath36 , aluminized mylar and monokote@xmath36 , with a hamamatsu s8664 - 55 avalanche photodiode for read - out .",
    "each crystal measures 2.2@xmath372.2@xmath3718  @xmath38 , corresponding to a depth of 21.2 radiation lengths and 0.844 nuclear interaction lengths .",
    "independently of the minimum bias trigger , the mpc is equipped with its own high energy cluster trigger .",
    "the trigger and digitization electronics are identical to those of the emcal and are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "for the presented data , the trigger efficiency starts at 5% for photon energies @xmath39  gev and reaches a plateau at 90% above @xmath40  gev .    a test - beam measurement , carried out at the meson test beam facility at the fermi national accelerator laboratory confirmed the calorimeter s linear energy response and measured the electromagnetic shower shapes .",
    "these shower shapes were then used to tune a geant 3.21  @xcite based full detector simulation .",
    "the absolute energy scale of the detector is determined _ in situ _ using a two - step process .",
    "first , minimum ionizing particles are used .",
    "yields of charged tracks in the calorimeter are enhanced by requiring a correlated hit in the bbc that is located in front of the mpc .",
    "additionally , the tower multiplicity of the cluster is required to be small compared to a typical electromagnetic shower to increase the hadronic contributions .",
    "a sample minimum ionizing particle peak is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpc_mip_fit ] with an expected mean energy of 234  mev .",
    "the initial mip calibration is then used as the seed in an iterative and converging procedure for individual towers that is based on the @xmath24 peak in the invariant mass distribution .",
    "time dependencies in the tower gains are tracked and corrected for by a monitoring system of leds , whose intensities are monitored by pin diodes . finally , the overall calibration is verified and the energy resolution is determined by comparing the masses of the @xmath24 and @xmath26 peaks in the two - cluster invariant mass distributions between data and a monte - carlo simulation .",

    "rhic accelerates and stores polarized proton beams at energies up to 255  gev in two independent rings .",
    "the beams collide at several interaction points along the ring .",
    "each ring can be filled with up to 120 bunches with different transverse polarization directions .",
    "these directions alternate to reduce systematic effects from slow variations in luminosity or detector acceptances and efficiencies .",
    "additionally , the patterns are chosen from four predefined basic patterns to reduce time dependent correlations and detector effects .",
    "previous publications describe in detail the necessary accelerator instrumentation for producing the colliding polarized beams  @xcite .",
    "the polarization is measured with a set of polarimeters external to the phenix experiment using elastic scattering from a hydrogen gas jet or a carbon fiber target . for the determination of the absolute polarization of both proton beams , the hydrogen jet polarimeter with a known polarization of the atomic jet",
    "is used  @xcite . due to the low density of the gas jet a polarization measurement with good accuracy",
    "requires many hours of data taking .",
    "therefore , the relative polarization is measured several times per fill with high precision by fast @xmath1+c polarimeters for each of the two storage rings  @xcite .",
    "these relative measurements are then normalized using results from the jet polarimeter .",
    "while both of the rhic beams are polarized during the measurement of the single spin asymmetries presented in this paper , summation over the bunches of one beam effectively averages the polarization to zero .",
    "this procedure is applied to one of the two beams at a time and can therefore be used as a cross check of two uncorrelated measurements of the asymmetry .",
