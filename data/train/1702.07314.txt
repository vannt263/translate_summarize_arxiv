    "@xmath1 ) ; however , high eccentricities may have a strong effect on the climate of exoplanets or exomoons ( _ e.g. , _ stability of liquid water between seasonal extremes ) .",
    "this is a very important effect to consider since 75% of all exoplanets with known orbits have orbital eccentricities larger than earth .",
    "the effects of orbital eccentricity on planetary habitability is a complex problem that has been explored by one- and three - dimensional climate models .",
    "the suitability for planets to maintain surface liquid water can be constrained by their orbital location as defined by the habitable zone ( hz ) , the circular region around a star in which liquid water could exist on the surface of a rocky planet @xcite .",
    "estimates on the occurrence of earth - like worlds around stars @xmath2 depend on recognizing those in the hz @xcite .",
    "the conservative inner edge of the hz is given by the runaway of liquid water ( _ i.e. , _ surface temperatures above @xmath3340 k ) , corresponding to a rapid increase in stratospheric water vapor content , which leads to loss of an earth - like ocean inventory within four to five billion years .",
    "the conservative outer edge is given by the maximum greenhouse necessary to keep temperatures above freezing ( _ i.e. , _ surface temperature above 273 k ) .",

    "the hz for circular orbits can be defined either in terms of orbital distance , stellar flux , or equilibrium temperature .",

    "the equilibrium temperature is useful for comparing the temperature regimes of planets , but is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their climate .",
    "surface temperatures are controlled by a complex interaction of albedo and greenhouse effects .",
    "planetary albedo can be estimated from equilibrium temperatures determined spectroscopically or from planet / star flux ratios @xcite . in practice",

    "the derivations presented in this paper use solar and terrestrial units from now on as shown in equations [ eq : f ] and [ eq : t ] .    surface temperatures , though , depend on the equilibrium temperature and greenhouse effect of the planets .",

    "the normalized greenhouse is very convenient since it summarizes a complex planetary property in a unitless quantity , as the planetary albedo does .",

    "for example , the annual global average surface temperature of mars is @xmath34 202 k , but its effective surface temperature is @xmath35 214 k @xcite .",

    "recognized that the temporal average of the equilibrium temperature is lower than the equilibrium temperature computed from the temporally averaged flux , although they did not calculate it .",
    "thus , the expressions @xmath39 ^ \\frac{1}{4},\\ ] ] @xmath40 ^\\frac{1}{4},\\ ] ] are incorrect interpretations that have been used extensively in the literature .",

    "the hz can be defined either in terms of distance , stellar flux , or equilibrium temperature for circular orbits , using equations [ eq : f ] and [ eq : t ] to convert from one another .",
    "this is not trivial for elliptical orbits because these quantities diverge differently with eccentricity .",
    "the usual approach is to compare the average stellar flux of the planet in an elliptical orbit ( equation [ eq : ft ] ) with the stellar flux limits of the hz , the so called ` mean flux approximation ' .",
    "equivalently , @xcite suggested an hz definition for elliptical orbits based on the mean flux approximation , but in terms of orbital distance .",
    "their eccentric habitable zone ( ehz ) is the range of orbits for which a planet receives as much flux over one orbit as a planet on a circular orbit in the hz .",
    "this consists of comparing the semi - major axis of the planet with the hz limits for circular orbits scaled by @xmath67 .",
    "here we prefer to avoid redefining the limits of the hz , which adds a complication for multiplanetary systems ( _ i.e. _ , each planet having a different hz ) . instead , we suggest to define some effective distance for planets in elliptical orbits , not necessarily equal to their average orbital distance as given by equations [ eq : rs ] or [ eq : rt ] . based on the mean flux approximation , the effective flux distance @xmath68 , the equivalent circular orbit with the same average stellar flux @xmath53 as the elliptic orbit is given by @xmath69 alternatively , using equation [ eq : tt ] we define a new effective thermal distance @xmath70 , the equivalent circular orbit with the same average equilibrium temperature @xmath36 as the elliptic orbit , given by @xmath71 ^ { -2 } \\\\ & \\approx a \\left [ 1 + \\tfrac{1}{8}e^2 + \\tfrac{21}{512}e^4 + o(e^6 ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effective distance based on the mean flux approximation ( equation [ eq : mfd1 ] ) and our _ mean thermal approximation _",
    "( equation [ eq : mfd2 ] ) are not equivalent , one decreasing while the other increasing with eccentricity , respectively .",
    "the difference between these two solutions are less than 5% for eccentricities below 0.7 , so our solution is a small correction that is more significant for high eccentric orbits",
    ". nevertheless , we argue that the mean thermal approximation provides a better characterization of the limits of the hz than the mean flux approximation for elliptical orbits since the hz is constrained by the thermal regime of the planet . therefore , we suggest that equation [ eq : mfd2 ] is better to determine whether planets in elliptical orbits are within the hz limits .",
    "our temporal solution shows that the average equilibrium temperature of planets slightly decreases with eccentricity until converging to a value about 10% less than for circular orbits .",
    "this result might seem contradictory because the average stellar flux strongly increases with eccentricity ; however , the average distance also increases with increasing eccentricity .",
    "the net effect is a small decrease in the equilibrium temperature with eccentricity as long as the planetary albedo stays constant throughout the orbit .",
    "that might be the case for bodies without atmospheres ; however , the bond albedo of planets with condensables ( _ e.g. _ , oceans ) in elliptic orbits might change significantly from the hot periastron ( _ e.g. _ , due to the absorption from water vapor ) to the cold apastron ( _ e.g. _ , due to the reflectivity of ice ) .",
    "we were able to reproduce well known expressions for the average distance and average stellar flux ( equations [ eq : rs ] , [ eq : rt ] , and [ eq : ft ] ) among our analytic solutions .",
    "the complete elliptic integral of the second kind were calculated using the gnu scientific library function ` gsl_sf_ellint_ecomp ` @xcite and the mathematica function ` elliptice ` ( note that the mathematica implementation of this function requires the square of the argument ) .",
    "our results were also validated with numerical solutions .",
    "the equations [ eq : f ] and [ eq : t ] were independently numerically integrated for a full orbit in idl using the ` rk4 ` procedure , which is a fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "both the analytic and numerical solutions agree as shown in figures [ fig.s ] and [ fig.t ] .",
    "as discussed in the introduction  [ sec : intro ] , there are different and incorrect interpretations in the literature of the equilibrium temperature of planets in elliptical orbits ( equations [ eq : twrong1 ] and [ eq : twrong2 ] ) .",
    "they might introduce large errors especially for large eccentricities ( figure [ fig.temp ] ) .",
    "the most common interpretation is one based on the average stellar flux ( equation [ eq : twrong1 ] ) , also known as the ` mean flux approximation ' .",
    "this interpretation gives errors larger than 5% for the average equilibrium temperature of planets with eccentricities higher than 0.48 , and over 10% for @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the interpretation based on the average distance ( equation [ eq : twrong2 ] ) is more consistent with our result ( _ i.e. _ , also decreases with eccentricity ) . in any case ,",
    "average values should always be between the corresponding minimum orbital distance at periastron @xmath73 and maximum at apastron @xmath74 .",
    "a similar , but incorrect analytic solution to our average equilibrium temperature from equation [ eq : tt ] was proposed by @xcite ( equation 13 in their paper ) .",
    "their solution suggests that the equilibrium temperature increases instead with eccentricity , but it is not self - consistent and for eccentricities below 0.8 gives values larger than the equilibrium temperature at periastron ( _ i.e. _ , the maximum value ) .",
    "for example , the solution of @xcite gives 230 k for the average equilibrium temperature for mars based on its orbital parameters and assuming a 0.25 bond albedo .",
    "this average value is outside the possible range of 200 k to 220 k between apastron and periastron , respectively .",
    "our solution gives 210 k , which is consistent with the nasa ames mars general circulation model @xcite .",
    "our calculated values are also in agreement from those in the literature for other solar system objects ( table [ table : planet ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , previous studies on the climate of planets in elliptical orbits did not include equilibrium temperature estimates to directly compare with our results .",
    "nevertheless , our results might explain previous conflicting studies , using surface temperature as a proxy .",
    "there are different ways to study the effect of eccentricity on the climate of planets ( _ e.g. _ , at constant semi - major axis , stellar flux , etc . ) .",
    "studied the effect of eccentricity on the climate of tidally - locked ocean planets using a global climate model lmdz under constant stellar flux .",
    "they showed that the higher the eccentricity of the planet and the higher the luminosity of the star , the less reliable is the mean flux approximation .",
    "a similar conclusion was previously obtained by @xcite for earth - like planets in high eccentric orbits with a one - dimensional energy balance climate model ( ebm ) .",
    "our equilibrium temperature estimates positively correlate with the surface temperature results of , which show that temperature decreases with eccentricity , contrary to the mean flux approximation ( table [ table : gcm ] ) . in this case ,",
    "our results characterize the decreasing thermal response with eccentricity and corresponding increase in effective orbital distance .",
    "our results are more relevant for planets in very eccentric orbits @xmath75 and constant albedo ( _ e.g. _ , hot - jupiters ) . in any case",
    ", they seem better to describe the thermal regime of planets than the mean flux approximation ( figure [ fig.temp ] ) . temperatures could increase with eccentricity as also shown by climate models @xcite .",
    "planets with condensable species ( _ e.g. _ , earth - like ) could experience strong variations on their albedo and heat redistribution during their elliptical orbit .",
    "@xcite showed that the planetary albedo not only depends on the surface and atmospheric properties of a planet , but it is also affected by both the stellar flux and the spectrum of the star .",
    "for example , it could go below 0.2 for earth - like planets receiving over 20% the stellar flux that earth receives around a sun - like or cooler star .",
    "heat redistribution is also more efficient in longer period tidally - locked planets .",
    "future studies will consider these important dynamical corrections .",
    "here we determined analytic solutions of the spatial and temporal averages of orbital distance , stellar flux , and equilibrium temperature for planets in elliptical orbits and constant albedo .",

    "the potential stability of surface liquid water on rocky planets in elliptical orbits is better characterized by a mean thermal approximation rather than the mean flux approximation .",

    ", planets move farther outside the hz ( _ i.e. _ , become colder ) with increasing eccentricity if all other conditions stay constant ; however , orbital variations of albedo , greenhouse , and heat redistribution might accentuate or invert this trend .",

    "the results of this paper might be used to reevaluate the effective location in the hz of many exoplanets with known eccentricity ( using equation [ eq : mfd3 ] ) , especially those small enough to be considered potentially habitable .",
