    "these large samples enable statistical studies of correlations between the properties of members of multi - planet systems .",
    "one result from these studies is that many planets appear to be close to mean - motion resonances , that is , their orbital periods are close to the ratio of two small integers ( see below for a more precise definition ) . in particular :    * @xcite comment that about one - third of the multi - planet systems studied by radial - velocity measurements contain near - resonant planet pairs , with about half of these near the 2:1 resonance .",
    "this is probably an underestimate because of a detection bias : there is an approximate degeneracy between the signal from an interior planet near the 2:1 resonance and harmonics arising from non - zero eccentricity in the outer planet orbit , which makes it difficult to detect low - mass planets in resonance with exterior companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite find that _ kepler _ planet pairs with orbital period ratios within a few percent of 2:1 or 3:2 are preferentially found just wide of the resonance ( i.e. , period ratio slightly larger than 2 or 1.5 ) and tend to avoid spacings just narrow of the resonance . *",

    "* in the gj 876 system , planets 2 , 3 , and 4 have periods close to the ratio 1:2:4 ; planets 2 and 3 are close to a secular resonance ; and there are other probable near - resonances ( see @xcite and references therein ) . because of these near - resonances , gravitational interactions between the planets are detectable in the radial - velocity data , and these can be used to constrain the mutual inclinations and determine whether various critical arguments librate or circulate . * within the solar system , jupiter and saturn are within 1% of a 5:2 resonance ( the `` great inequality '' ) , uranus and neptune are within 2% of a 2:1 resonance , and pluto is in a 3:2 resonance with neptune .",
    "there are also many resonances among the satellites of jupiter and saturn .",
    "another notable near - resonance occurs between the two outer planets of the pulsar psr b1257 + 12 , which are within 2% of a 3:2 resonance .",
    "this near - resonance produces gravitational interactions large enough to be easily detectable , which allowed the existence of the planets to be confirmed and their inclinations to be measured shortly after their discovery @xcite .    loosely speaking",

    "the case @xmath9 is sometimes called a corotation or co - orbital resonance ; examples in the solar system include the trojan asteroids ( 1:1 resonance with jupiter ) and the saturnian satellites janus and epimetheus , but no extrasolar co - orbital resonances are known . when @xmath10 it is called the order of the resonance , since for planets on nearly circular , coplanar orbits the strength of the resonance potential is proportional to @xmath11 or @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the eccentricities and inclinations of the resonant planets .",

    "the existence of near - resonant planet pairs is often ascribed to convergent migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there are problems with this hypothesis :    * the fraction of planets in resonance is quite small : @xcite find peaks at the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances of @xmath16 planet pairs each , out of a total sample of @xmath17 planet pairs ; this small fraction is noteworthy since capture into the 2:1 resonance is certain during convergent migration if the planets cross the resonance slowly enough and their initial eccentricities and inclinations are small enough .",
    "`` slowly enough '' means a migration timescale larger than @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the migrating planet s mass and orbital period ;",
    "`` small enough '' means initial eccentricity smaller than @xmath21 ( see appendix ) .",
    "typical type i migration times for _ kepler _ planets in a low - mass protoplanetary disk are @xmath22@xmath23 @xcite , in which case migrating planets might avoid resonance capture according to this criterion , but orbit integrations by @xcite that include eccentricity damping show that most _ kepler _ planets are captured even if the migration time is as short as @xmath24 .",
    "* convergent migration typically leads to capture into a 2:1 resonance .",
    "capture into resonances with smaller separations , such as 3:2 or 4:3 , becomes increasingly difficult : for example , to capture a planet into the 3:2 resonance requires either that the initial conditions are fine - tuned so that the planets form in the narrow interval between the 2:1 and 3:2 resonance ( only 13% of the outer planet s semi - major axis ) , or that the migration rate is fast enough that the planet jumps the weaker 2:1 and is captured at the 3:2 resonance . yet",
    "@xcite find that the excess of planet pairs near the 3:2 resonance is at least as strong as the excess at the 2:1 resonance ( see @xcite for a detailed numerical study of these issues ) .",
    "* in the sample of _ kepler _ multi - planet systems examined by @xcite , the excess of planet pairs at period ratios just larger than 2 is accompanied by a deficit at period ratios just smaller than 2 .",
    "both the peak and the trough have an equivalent width of about 20 planets .",
    "this strongly suggests that the features at this resonance arise from rearranging the periods of planets near the resonance , rather than by capturing planets at the resonance , which should produce a peak but no trough .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have pointed out that dissipation due to tides from the host star or the protoplanetary disk tends to repel near - resonant planets , in the sense that their period ratios evolve away from unity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if migration is common , dissipation could explain why there are so few near - resonant planet pairs ; and if there is little or no migration , dissipation could explain why planet pairs that initially happen to lie near a resonance are now preferentially found wide of the resonance .",
    "this hypothesis is discussed further in  [ sec : previous ] .    although these and other analyses in the literature shed considerable light on the behavior of near - resonant planets in the presence of dissipation and/or migration",
    ", our view is that they put the cart before the horse : the question that should be addressed first is , what is the distribution of mean motions or period ratios expected near a resonance in the _ absence _ of dissipation or migration ?",
    "efforts to address this question have a long and rich history , mostly in the context of the asteroid belt , in which the distribution of mean motions contains gaps at the 4:1 , 3:1 , 5:2 , 7:3 , and 2:1 resonances with jupiter ( the kirkwood gaps ) and peaks at the 3:2 and 1:1 resonances ( the hilda family and the trojan asteroids ) .",
    "most of these features can be largely explained through chaotic evolution of the asteroid orbits on timescales as long as 1 gyr , long after the formation of the solar system was complete @xcite . although the effects of dissipation and migration are discernible in the orbital distribution of asteroids , these features are comparatively subtle @xcite . thus the asteroid belt demonstrates that dissipation and large - scale migration are not essential to produce near - resonant features in the mean - motion distribution . unfortunately for our purposes , the chaotic evolution of the asteroids appears to depend strongly on the details of the planetary configuration in the solar system and",
    "thus the insights gained from studies of the asteroid belt can not be immediately applied to exoplanets .",
    "in this paper we focus on a simple and highly idealized model for the formation of near - resonant features : at an initial time @xmath25 we place a single planet and a large number of test particles on circular orbits around the host star .",
    "the test particles are interior to the planet and smoothly distributed in semi - major axis ( see equation [ eq : epsilon ] ) .",

    "we follow the motion of the test particles using osculating keplerian orbital elements , with @xmath28 being the semi - major axis , eccentricity , longitude of periapsis and mean anomaly . for canonical elements we use the modified delaunay variables @xmath29",

    "the first term describes the unperturbed keplerian motion of the test particle about the sun , and the remainder describes the perturbation from the planet .",
    "transit observations of exoplanets measure the time interval @xmath34 between successive transits , that is , the interval in which the longitude increases by @xmath35 .",
    "we must relate the transit - based mean motion @xmath36 to the osculating mean motion @xmath1 , given by @xmath37 .",
    "write the perturbing hamiltonian as @xmath38 where @xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting a time average over an interval comparable to the total observational timespan ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the short - period and long - period parts of the hamiltonian . then @xmath43 is the time average of the rate of change of the mean longitude , @xmath44 , and we have @xmath45 where @xmath1 is the osculating mean motion .    for the resonances we shall examine ,",
    "the second term in these equations is small ; thus we may neglect the distinction between @xmath1 and @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , the distribution of transit - based period ratios near resonances is determined mainly by the distribution of the osculating mean motions rather than by any differences between the osculating and transit - based mean motions .",
    "we consider the vicinity of a first - order mean - motion resonance , where the ratio of the mean motions of the planet and the test particle is @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath47 corresponds to an interior resonance ( test particle inside the planet ) and @xmath48 is an exterior resonance .",
    "we now assume that the resonances are sufficiently well separated compared to the size of the perturbations induced by the planet that we can ignore all of the perturbations except those associated with the @xmath46 resonance ( we call this the single - resonance approximation ) .",

    "for simplicity we have assumed that the planet is on a circular orbit and that the test - particle and planet orbits are coplanar .",
    "since @xmath55 is a fast variable , we will drop @xmath55-dependent terms , which is equivalent to replacing @xmath54 by @xmath42 ; consequently , the resonance hamiltonian is independent of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a constant of the motion .",

    "the difference between the single - resonance theory and the three - body integrations is mostly due to the excitation of somewhat larger eccentricities in the integrations that tend to populate the peak wide of 3:2 with more particles , while excavating a deeper gap around this resonance ; 310 test particles with @xmath242 are promoted to orbits with @xmath262 and 16 to escape orbits , which accounts for the difference in magnitude between ew@xmath254 and ew@xmath263 .",

    "we comment on how the distributions in period ratio are affected by different values of the planet mass and eccentricity , and the initial rms eccentricity and inclination of the test particles .",
    "we have run sets of three - body integrations in which the mass of the planet varies over the range @xmath208@xmath209 .",
    "these experiments show that the integration results obey the scalings predicted by the single - resonance theory : in particular the eccentricity of the test particles scales as @xmath264 , while the equivalent width varies as @xmath257ew@xmath265 .",
    "thus , varying the planet mass simply produces re - scaled versions of the pdf around the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances shown in figure [ fig : dist_fiducial ] .",
    "these scalings are more difficult to study for resonances that are closer to the planet , both because of particle ejections and possible resonance overlap .",
    "nevertheless , in most cases the analytical single - resonance theory allows us to scale predictions for the distribution of period ratios to different resonances and different planetary masses .",
    "varying the eccentricities of the test particles can strongly modify the final distribution of period ratios .",
    "in particular , values of @xmath266 ( equation [ eq : sigma_e ] ) that are larger than the eccentricity scale @xmath267 ( equation [ eq : sedef ] ) tend to suppress the characteristic peak+trough or `` p - cygni '' feature around first - order resonances . for reference , from equation ( [ eq : sedef ] ) the eccentricity scale for a jupiter - mass planet at the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances is 0.05 and 0.063 , respectively . for values of @xmath266",
    "lower than @xmath267 the pdfs are similar to those starting with initially circular orbits ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "non - zero eccentricity of the perturber is expected to introduce chaotic zones in the vicinity of the resonances , such that initially circular orbits are excited to higher eccentricity over a wider range in period ratios compared with the case of a zero - eccentricity perturber . in numerical simulations with perturber eccentricities",
    "@xmath2680.1 , we observe that a large fraction of test particles with @xmath269 are ejected to escape orbits , leaving a strong gap around 3:2 and almost no evidence of a peak wide of the resonance . additionally , the gap around the 2:1 resonance is observed to be wider and less deep than for a zero - eccentricity perturber , while the peak wide of the resonance is observed to be somewhat weaker .",
    "non - zero eccentricities could also lead to slow evolution of the period - ratio distribution on timescales much longer than the @xmath222 planet orbits used in the fiducial simulations ; we have carried out extended integrations for up to @xmath270 planet orbits but see no additional changes in the period - ratio distribution",

    "although the dominant features around the first - order 3:2 and 2:1 resonances are still present , the  p - cygni \" profile shows a less sharp peak that is shifted to larger period ratios , and gaps that are slightly wider than in the zero - inclination case .",
    "more specifically , we find that at 2:1 the equivalent widths slightly increase to @xmath257ew@xmath278 ( see values in table [ tab : ew ] for comparison with the fiducial simulation ) , while at 3:2 we observe that more particles are ejected to escape orbits relative to the zero - inclination case , resulting in an increase in magnitude of ew@xmath254 to @xmath279 and a decrease of ew@xmath263 to @xmath280 . finally , the gap at the second - order 7:5 resonance gets wider by a factor of roughly two .",

    "there are too few planets left in the sample .    as usual ,",

    "this result does not exclude the possibility that a significant signal would be revealed by some other more sensitive test . in the top and bottom panels",
    ", there is a significant signal in that the uniform distribution is excluded at about the 97% confidence level .",

    "we attribute this difference mainly to our restricted data set : we use only two - planet systems whereas fabrycky et al .",
    "use all planet pairs in multi - planet systems , so our sample is @xmath300 times smaller .",
    "the difference might also hint that near - resonant features are more common in multi - planet systems than in two - planet systems .",
    "the few hundred multiple planet candidates discovered by the _ kepler _ spacecraft provide a unique window into how planets form and evolve , although we do not yet know how to interpret the limited view that we have through this window .",
    "this paper is focused on the distribution of planets near mean - motion resonances in multi - planet systems , which has two important features .",
    "first , the number of systems near mean - motion resonances is small : the left panel of figure [ fig : sim+obs ] shows that the only resonance feature that is significant at more than the 1.5@xmath283 level is the peak at the 3:2 resonance . as discussed in ",
    "[ sect : intro ] , this result is striking because since planet migration is believed to be a common process , and capture into a first - order resonance during convergent migration is certain if the eccentricities and inclinations of the planet pair are sufficiently small and migration is sufficiently slow when the resonance is crossed .",
    "second , at both the 3:2 and 2:1 first - order resonances the peak in the period - ratio distribution appears just wide of the resonance ( i.e. , at period ratios greater than the resonance value , if the period ratio is defined to be @xmath301 ) , rather than at the resonance .",
    "in addition , the 2:1 resonance appears to have a trough in the period - ratio distribution just narrow of the resonance , although the statistical significance of the trough is weak .",
    "all of these features were pointed out already by @xcite .",
    "given these findings , it is natural to ask what distribution of period ratios should be expected near resonance if there is no migration , i.e. , if planets form _ in situ_. we have investigated two extreme limits of this process , in which the planet forms fast or slowly ( relative to the characteristic dynamical time associated with the resonance ) .",
    "we find that in both cases the distribution of test particles near resonance develops a shape characterized by a peak wide of the resonance ( period @xmath302 where the period ratio at resonance @xmath303 ) and a trough narrow of the resonance ( see figures [ fig : sudden ] and [ fig : slow ] ) .",
    "the peak and trough result from a redistribution of particles from period ratios @xmath304 to @xmath305 , rather than from an overall gain or loss of particles as would occur through processes such as ejection or migration .",
    "the mean and median radius for the planets in the 242 two - planet systems in @xcite are @xmath306 and @xmath307 , respectively .",
    "to compare our models to the data , i.e. , to estimate the strength parameter @xmath82 in figure [ fig : p_values ] , we need the mass - radius relation for the _ kepler _ planets .",
    "\\(i ) fitting to the planets in the solar system , @xcite find @xmath308 for @xmath309 , which yields @xmath310 and @xmath311 for the mean and median mass in the _ kepler _ two - planet sample .",
    "( ii ) from a statistical fit to transit timing variations in the _ kepler _ sample , @xcite find @xmath312 , which implies @xmath313 and @xmath314 for the mean and median mass .",
    "( iii ) there are four planets with measurements of both mass and radius in the radius range 2@xmath315 ; these have mean and median masses of @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "all three of these crude approaches suggest a typical planet mass of about 6@xmath318 for the _ kepler _ planets .",
    "our simple theoretical model , based on slow growth of the planet masses with no migration , is consistent with the data ( @xmath319 ) shown in figure [ fig : p_values ] for values of the strength @xmath82 between 0.006 and 0.018 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sdef ] ) gives @xmath320 and @xmath321 at 3:2 and 2:1 , respectively ; focusing on the 3:2 resonance , which contains the strongest signal , consistency then requires @xmath322 .",
    "our calculations are for a system containing a test particle and a planet of mass @xmath19 ; in the _ kepler _ two - planet systems both planets have non - zero mass and in the absence of a detailed numerical study of this case the most appropriate choice is probably to identify @xmath19 in these formulae with twice the mean planet mass .",
    "thus the mean planet mass required to explain the resonant structure seen in the _ kepler _ data at the 3:2 resonance is roughly 20@xmath0 .",
    "the low end of this mass range is about three times the mean planet mass estimated in the preceding subsection .",
    "there are several possibilities for bridging this gap :    [ [ test - particle - calculations - underestimate - the - dynamical - effect - of - resonances ] ] test - particle calculations underestimate the dynamical effect of resonances + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our analytic calculations are only possible because one of the two planets was approximated as a test particle .",
    "if both planets have non - zero masses , the dynamical problem acquires extra degrees of freedom ; even the planar single - resonance model has two degrees of freedom which allows chaos caused by overlap of the closely spaced resonances with critical angles @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "we have carried out exploratory integrations in which we replace the three - body system containing a planet of mass @xmath19 and a test particle with two planets of mass @xmath325 , leaving the other initial conditions and parameters the same .",
    "we find that the peaks and troughs at the @xmath326 and @xmath327 resonances become significantly stronger , and that a secondary peak develops narrow of the @xmath327 resonance .",
    "[ [ long - term - evolution ] ] long - term evolution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    systems with more than two degrees of freedom can exhibit slow evolution due to weak chaos ( a classic example is the kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt , which can evolve on gyr timescales ; @xcite ) .",
    "integrations that follow two planets with non - zero masses , eccentricities , and inclinations may have resonant features that evolve over timescales much longer than those we have examined here .",
    "[ [ underestimated - planet - masses ] ] underestimated planet masses + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    simultaneous measurements of mass and radius are available for 8 planets in the radius range 1@xmath315 .",
    "these show an order of magnitude range of mean density , from @xmath328 for kepler 11f @xcite to @xmath329 for kepler 10b @xcite .",
    "this wide range implies either a diverse set of planetary compositions @xcite or unmodeled errors in some or all of the measurements . in either case the actual value of the `` typical '' _ kepler _ planet mass is far more uncertain than the simple estimate of 6@xmath318 obtained above .",
    "in particular , if there is a substantial population of rock - iron planets with radii of 2@xmath315 these would have much larger masses : for a radius of @xmath330 , @xcite find masses of 30@xmath331 for a variety of rock - iron compositions , and @xcite find masses from @xmath332 for basalt to @xmath0 for nickel - iron planets .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that tidal dissipation can repel planet pairs from exact resonance , producing a peak wide of the resonance and a trough narrow of the resonance as observed in the _ kepler _ data . however",
    ", this process requires that ( i ) the planet pairs form in resonance ; ( ii ) the correct amount of dissipation is present to repel the planet pairs from resonance by a percent or so .",
    "moreover , if tidal dissipation from the host star were responsible for shaping the period - ratio distribution around resonances , one should expect a strong dependence on orbital radius or period ( the characteristic timescale for changes in semi - major axis @xmath210 varies as @xmath333 in the tidal evolution model of @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite points out that the period - ratio distribution in the _ kepler _ sample restricted to inner - planet periods @xmath334 looks identical to the distribution restricted to inner - planet periods @xmath335 .",
    "we have repeated rein s analysis for the restricted sample of two - planet systems used here and observe that there is a hint that the resonant features are more pronounced at the 3:2 resonance for the longer period planets , and more pronounced at the 2:1 resonance for the shorter periods planets . however , the number of planet pairs in our restricted sample is too small to make a statistically significant detection of any difference .",
    "@xcite has also investigated whether stochastic migration can reproduce the _ kepler _ period - ratio distribution .",
    "he argues that conventional `` smooth '' migration can not reproduce the observations because it produces too many planet systems in exact resonance .",
    "however , these large pile - ups at resonance are smeared out by including stochastic forces that might be expected from the likely turbulent nature of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "he shows that for the correct combination of stochastic and smooth migration forces , the final period - ratio distribution looks similar to that of the _ kepler _ planets .",
    "we note that eccentricity measurements of near - resonant planets do not distinguish between these mechanisms : tidal dissipation damps the free eccentricity so the residual eccentricity is equal to the forced eccentricity , which is just the fixed point of the single - resonance hamiltonian shown in figure [ fig : fixedpoints ] .",
    "slow growth of the planet causes a test particle on an initially circular orbit to follow the fixed point as the planet mass grows , so that it will also have zero free eccentricity unless it has crossed the separatrix .",
    "we have studied the orbital distribution of two - planet systems near first - order mean - motion resonances in the simplest possible model of planet formation : there is no energy dissipation or migration , and planets form _ in situ _ on circular , coplanar orbits , with masses growing at a prescribed rate .",
    "we have examined whether this toy model can explain the signatures in the period - ratio distribution near resonances that are observed in the _ kepler _ sample of 242 two - planet systems .",
    "our approach is to construct a simplified hamiltonian that isolates the perturbations due to a given first - order resonance .",
    "we then solve for the long - term dynamics of a test particle in this hamiltonian , focusing on two limiting cases : rapid and slow mass growth of the planet .",
    "we have used numerical integrations of the restricted three - body problem to confirm that the resonance hamiltonian captures the main features of the orbit evolution .",
    "we find that the distribution in period ratios resembles a `` p - cygni '' profile , where orbits are evacuated from narrow of the resonance ( i.e. , closer to the perturbing planet ) and pile up in regions wide of the resonance .",
    "these features are present whether the planet grows fast or slowly , though they are stronger in the latter case , and hence should be present for a wide range of growth histories .",
    "the resulting structure in the period - ratio distribution is strongly reminiscent of the peak - trough feature observed at the @xmath326 and @xmath327 resonances in the _ kepler _ systems .",
    "the model and observed period - ratio distributions near these resonances are consistent for mean planet masses in the range 20@xmath0 . this is larger than expected from the handful of _ kepler _ planets with typical radii of 2@xmath315 and measured masses by a factor of 315 .",
    "however , the mass - radius relation for _ kepler _ planets is quite uncertain and shows large scatter , and the required masses are consistent with the masses expected for planets in this radius range that are composed of a mixture of silicates and iron with no extended atmosphere .",
    "other effects such as weak chaos operating on gyr timescales may also narrow the gap between the model and the observations .",
    "our model suggests that the resonant features seen in the _ kepler _ multi - planet systems may not require either dissipation or migration during the planet - formation process .",

    "capture into a @xmath336 resonance during convergent migration is certain if the planets cross the resonance slowly enough and their eccentricities and inclinations are small enough .",
    "these statements can be quantified using the formalism of  [ sect : analytic ] .    in convergent migration ,",
    "the dimensionless resonance distance @xmath79 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : delta ] ) is increasing with time . since the resonant hamiltonian @xmath93 ( eq .  [ e : kres ] )",
    "is dimensionless , resonance crossing without capture should occur when @xmath337 where @xmath338 is some constant of order unity . converting this inequality to physical units yields @xmath339 ; then the condition for resonance crossing without capture is @xmath340 where @xmath20 is the massive planet s orbital period and latexmath:[$w_p\\equiv    ( @xmath327 resonance ) and 3.377 for @xmath342 ( @xmath326 resonance ) .",

    "the maximum eccentricity at which capture into resonance is certain during convergent migration has been derived by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the eccentricity of the test particle when far from resonance is @xmath343 , then the area enclosed by its orbit in the @xmath95-@xmath96 plane is @xmath344 ( eq .  [ eq : sedef ] ) . because of adiabatic invariance",
    ", this area is conserved as the planet migrates .",

    "figure [ fig : topology ] ) , if @xmath345 , the area of the homoclinic orbit .",
    "as the planet continues to migrate and @xmath79 continues to grow , the area inside the homoclinic orbit grows so the test particle remains inside the homoclinic orbit , i.e. , it remains captured in the resonance .",
