    "extragalactic continuum emission is complicated by the presence of non - thermal synchrotron emission within the beam , particularly at wavelengths longer than 6  cm . while it is possible in theory to do a spectral and spatial separation of free - free and synchrotron emission @xcite with multi - wavelength observations , the free - free emission can be most easily measured at millimeter wavelengths , where radio synchrotron has declined and",

    "the strong star formation activity is probably responsible for the hot gas outflows found in optical , mm , and x - ray studies .",

    "extinction is high and patchy in m82 @xcite , estimated to be @xmath8 @xcite on large scales , and as much as several hundred mag behind the molecular clouds @xcite , thus radio free - free emission is a particularly valuable tracer of ionized gas in this dusty starburst galaxy .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the compact radio sources at longer , cm wavelengths @xcite in m82 have shown them to be mostly non - thermal synchrotron sources , probably supernova remnants ( snr ) but possibly synchrotron - emitting wind driven bubbles @xcite .",

    "the integrated flux density in the naturally weighted d - array map is @xmath38 jy . the total flux reported for m82 from _ wmap _ at 41 ghz flux density is @xmath39 jy @xcite .",

    "the estimate of the non - thermal component is 35% of the total at 7  mm , extrapolating from vla cm - wave flux densities of the same region @xcite .",

    "we attribute the discrepancy to thermal emission from some hii   regions distributed on too large a spatial scale to be seen in peaks in these images .",
    "the 14 compact sources of the high resolution map ( fig.[figure : na_maps]a ) contribute @xmath47 of the total 7  mm flux density in the low resolution d - array map ( fig.[figure : na_maps]b ) .",

    "[ section : agn ] and  [ section : individual_nonthermal ] , respectively .    of the nine hii  regions in the high resolution map , two have flux densities at more than five frequencies .",
    "fitting of the spectra of these two sources suggests that they have free - free turnover frequencies ( where @xmath50 ) @xmath512.55  ghz . to have @xmath52 a few ghz requires emission measures of @xmath53  pc  @xmath2 .",
    "the other sources have flux densities at only three frequencies , and a single power law represents their observed flux densities fairly well ( fig.[figure : sed_hii ] ) . some of the deviations may be due to small amounts of extended emission in the sources and the slightly ( 15 - 20% ) differing beams of the flux densities from the literature .",
    "four sources have rising sed ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "rising spectrum radio sources have been found in many extragalactic systems , and are thought to be giant compact hii  regions with high electron density @xcite . these are much larger than galactic compact hii  regions because the super star clusters ( sscs ) , the clusters exciting them , are much larger both in excitation and in physical size . for the sources here ,",
    "the emission appears to remain partially optically thick at frequencies up to 43  ghz , so we expect to see brightness temperatures of @xmath55  k. their observed brightness temperatures are lower than this , and imply ems @xmath56 ( derived from peak flux density ) , consistent with turnover frequencies of 3  ghz , an order of magnitude lower than observed .",
    "the low brightness temperatures indicate small filling factors , and signal the presence of very compact sources of significantly less than 3 pc extent , which we can not resolve .    considering the radio continuum luminosity , brightness of the emission , and the turnover frequency ,",
    "these appear to be young hiiregions , and we infer that the star clusters exciting these nebulae are also relatively young .",
    "the total flux density of just the detected compact hii  regions comes to @xmath4 38 mjy , which is @xmath4 6% of the total thermal flux density at 7  mm ( at the same sensitivity ) , in other words , @xmath4 6% of the ionizing flux density .",
    "but the high resolution 7  mm image fails to detect all of the compact hii  regions in m82 , even fairly optically luminous ones such as m82-a1 @xcite , so we believe that there are more compact regions below our current detection limit . in this case",
    "the hii  region phase in m82 must last at least @xmath4 6% of the @xmath410 myr lifetime of o stars , and possibly longer , to a myr or more . to restrain the hii  regions from expanding",
    "requires external or internal confinements , perhaps external high pressures @xcite , or in the larger clusters , potentially slowing by gravity @xcite .",
    "the compact sources are shown in figure [ figure : dust_lanes ] overlaid on a color ( vri ) image from the _ spitzer _  legacy project sings @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the compact sources are found in dust lanes .",
    "the only exception is source 43.922 + 59.70 , which is located near the dynamical center , and a potential agn candidate ( @xmath576 . )",
    "we have attempted to align the compact radio sources identified in this and previous work ( allen 1999 , mcdonald et al 2002 , and references therein ) with the published _ hst _  near - ir continuum images of @xcite and @xcite , the catalogued optical clusters @xcite , and the archived _ hst _  optical measurements .",
    "there is no consistent alignment of the radio and other sources within the _ hst _  pointing uncertainty .",
    "the hii  regions we see are presumably associated with young sscs ; that the clusters are not seen in the optical / near - ir continuum argues that the extinction must be high ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the molecular clouds alone can contribute @xmath59 of @xmath60@xmath61 if they happen to be along the line of sight to the hii  regions .",
    "if the average extinction at arcsecond resolution is @xmath62 ( from h - k color by * ? ?",
    "* assuming @xmath63 ) , the line - of - sight extinctions implied in the lack of near - ir sources to these young clusters must be 4 times higher .",

    "if the @xmath69 emission is associated with the corresponding radio hii  regions , we estimate , based on the inferred lyman continuum flux densities , that the extinction toward these ir - visible nebulae is @xmath70 .",
    "none of these three sources are apparent in the _ hst _  near - ir continuum images , and it agrees with the high extinction suggested in the @xmath69 image .      besides the compact dense sources in table [ table : compact_em ] , we detect extended regions in m82 with relatively high em . in figure",
    "[ figure : extended_b - array ] we show b - array maps of free - free emission regions with integrated flux density of 50  70  mjy in 5 9  area .",
    "these regions have @xmath71",
    ". this agrees with the d - array measurements shown in table [ table : peaks_darray ] .",
    "high em can be produced either by high rms electron density or by a long sightline ( @xmath72 ) of ionized gas .",
    "if high electron density is responsible , then to reconcile the high em with the observed flux ( @xmath7 ) requires that the line of sight length be much smaller than the observed transverse distance .",
    "for example , to maintain the ionization of a spherical volume of radius 15  pc , the observed transverse diameter of source in fig [ figure : extended_b - array]a , and rms electron density @xmath73 ( @xmath74 was inferred by @xcite in a 2  resolution ) requires a lyman continuum rate of @xmath75 .",
    "the observed flux of this structure indicates @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that the actual emitting volume is smaller , i.e. , the emitting region is sheetlike .",
    "there are a number of such patches evident in figure [ figure : extended_b - array ] . while these large regions of high electron density are dynamically stable in the high pressure @xmath77 environment of the m82 starburst , the excitation requirements are inconsistent with other star formation indicators , with the possible exception of the `` yin - yang '' shaped source ( fig .",
    "[ figure : extended_b - array]c ) located at the peak of the low resolution map ( fig .",
    "[ figure : na_maps ] ) .",
    "these structures could be the ionized surfaces of chimneys @xcite or superbubbles .",
    "the coincidence of their locations with dust lane and co gas distribution implies that they are associated with in the molecular clouds , which would be consistent with an origin in the outer , ionized layers of large molecular clouds .    despite its location near the edge of the superbubble ,",
    "the `` yin - yang '' source is an exception in that it does appear to have sufficient flux to support the ionization , and there is a bright mid - ir source here too @xcite .",
    "however this source has an unusual structure that is coherent and bubble - like on a scale of @xmath12 = 26  pc .",
    "if this were a bubble , an energy of @xmath78  ergs would be required to clear the inner region of gas .",
    "another explanation for these extended regions is that they represent a collection of smaller hii  regions representing distributed star formation at the end of the stellar bar in m82 .",
    "regions ( b ) - ( d ) in figure [ figure : extended_b - array ] are distributed on the 10  ionized ring of m82 @xcite , which may represent the @xmath79-orbits of a bar .",
    "the region ( a ) is on the east ionized ridge , and probably near the end of the @xmath79-orbits .",
    "star formation is observed to be near bar ends , perhaps facilitated by cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "the dense star forming regions traced by high brightness 7  mm free - free emission are likely to be still close to their natal giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "we therefore expect a high correlation of thermal free - free emission and molecular line emission , although at some sufficiently high resolution , they should begin to anti - correlate . in figure [ figure : molecular_gas ] , we show the 7  mm map with contours of co(1 - 0 ) line emission from the ovro map of @xcite and an hcn(1 - 0 ) map from the plateau de bure interferometer ( schilke , private communication ) .",
    "the molecular gas tracer co(1 - 0 ) is more extended in the plane of the galaxy , while the dense molecular gas tracer hcn(1 - 0 ) emission is confined to the star formation area .",
    "it is apparent that the correlation of the 7  mm continuum emission , largely free - free emission , with hcn gas is excellent .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the molecular line fluxes and the free free flux confirms this conclusion .",
    "figure [ figure : hcn_7 mm ] shows the beam - to - beam comparison between the low resolution 7  mm emission and hcn .",
    "the linear correlation between hcn and radio continuum shown in figure [ figure : hcn_7 mm ] agrees with the tight correlation between global hcn emission and star formation tracers ( such as far - ir emission ) discovered in local normal spiral and starburst galaxies @xcite , in galactic molecular dense cores @xcite , and in high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "our plot shows that this good correlation between dense molecular gas and star formation extends down to scales of tens of pc .",
    "to more directly compare our results with @xcite who determined the correlation in terms of infrared luminosity , @xmath80 and hcn line flux , we have translated the 7  mm flux density into @xmath80 .",
    "we assume an o - star - dominated stellar population which yields the relation of @xmath81 , following @xcite and @xcite , or @xmath82 at 3.6  mpc .",

    "we limit the data points shown to those with @xmath91 detection at 7  mm .",

    "the ratio is linear , with @xmath92 and a @xmath89 zero intercept @xmath93 in 2.2  beam .",
    "the high correlation of @xmath5 and 7  mm emission may mean that they are excited by the same relatively strong radiation sources on the @xmath94 length scale .",
    "the @xmath89 that appears even at zero @xmath90 , about 40% of the total , could be excited by the relatively older population of b stars that do not produce strong radio continuum emission .",
    "integrating the correlated ( above the offset level ) @xmath5 flux density gives about 30  jy .",

    "this would give @xmath97 about a factor of 10 lower than observed .",
    "all relations of the pah luminosity to the @xmath98 are uncertain and have large scatter because the pah flux will depend on the geometry of the radiation field , the role of dust , the presence of b stars , and possibly other factors not yet considered .",
    "the spatial correlation of the pah feature and the ionization in m82 is clear ; the quantitative relation is not yet so .",

    "if @xmath118 which ensures the pah survival in the pdrs but not inside the ionized media @xcite , @xmath119 is required to supply the observed pah , close to the critical density for hcn excitation .",
    "this agrees with the good correlation between intensities of pah with hcn emission in m82 found in @xmath120 beam ( not shown in this paper ) .",
    "@xcite proposed the star formation history of selected starburst regions in m82 based on iso mid - ir imaging and spectroscopy for @xmath121@xmath122 . for the central @xmath123 region , they found star formation had peaked near 5 and 9 myr ago with amplitudes of 6.3 and 18.5 @xmath124 , respectively , and had dipped to less than 0.1 @xmath124 at 6 myr or so .",
    "previously @xcite had commented on the lack of the wolf - rayet ( w - r ) spectral signatures in m82 , which may be due to high extinction toward the `` young '' star forming regions ( 36 myr ) where the w - r stars live , but could also reflect the star formation rate ( sfr ) dip near 3 + myr ago .",
    "our observations suggest that high extinction is the reason for the absence of wr features , since all of the young radio free - free sources are found in heavily visually obscured regions .",
    "the integrated flux density at 7 mm of the full region @xcite mapped is about 340 mjy in the low resolution 7  mm map .",
    "this equates to a total mass in young stars of @xmath125 formed within the average lifetime of o stars of 13 myr , for a salpeter imf of 1 - 100 @xmath126 .",
    "the contribution of the previous two starburst events at 5 myr and 9 myr to 7  mm flux density would be negligible . the average sfr over this region in about the past 3 myr ( before o stars enter the w - r phase ) , based on inferred total mass of young star population from 7  mm flux density , is thus estimated as 4 @xmath127 ( salpeter imf of 1 - 100 @xmath126 ) , in agreement with the radio recombination line study by @xcite and with the rate estimated based on numbers of radio snr @xcite .",
    "our 7  mm continuum images give a picture of where the young star - forming regions are in m82 , particularly the compact 7  mm sources , which are likely very young embedded clusters .",
    "what is the spatial relation of these sources to the molecular gas ?",
    "is there evidence in the spatial distribution for how the star formation was triggered ?",
    "we can estimate @xmath128 , the mass of new stars formed , from @xmath80 , @xmath129 , the total mass of gas , from @xmath130 , and the mass of dense ( @xmath131 ; @xmath132 ) gas from @xmath133 .",
    "the dense gas fraction is therefore @xmath134 and the star formation efficiency , the fraction of total gas converted to newly formed stars , is @xmath135 .",
    "this is the star formation efficiency for the current generation of stars ( i.e. , on time scales of a few myr ) .",
    "we convert our observed @xmath136 in lower resolution map to @xmath137 in the 2.7  beam , take that @xmath137 to be @xmath80 , and find @xmath128 from @xmath138 , which assumes an o star dominated population with salpeter imf between 1 - 100 @xmath126 . since we are using the total 7  mm flux density for this computation rather than the thermal 7  mm flux density , the @xmath137 and @xmath80 values could be overestimated by 30% due to the nonthermal contribution .",
    "the full translation is uncertain by a factor of 3 , mainly corresponding to the difference in lower mass cutoff in imf .",
    "we find the dense gas mass fraction from @xmath139 .",
    "for the molecular gas mass , we adopt the conversion of @xmath140 , and @xmath141 from @xcite .",
    "these conversions for molecular gas are uncertain by a factor of 23 , discussed in @xcite .    in figure [",

    "the corresponding sfe against the dense gas fraction ( dgf ) are shown on the top and right .",
    "the data points of m82 represent the results on a 2.7  scale ( or @xmath4 46 pc ) .",

    "the sfe and dgf track in m82 roughly as they do in all sources , although the size scales of the observations can be very different .",
    "all m82 data area lie under the sfe : dgf=1:1 line , which suggests that less than 50% of the molecular gas has been turned into stars .",
    "most of the data points lie above the sfe : dgf  =  1:10 line , implying a limit of @xmath4 10% sfe for dense molecular gas .",
    "we have detected 5 non - thermal sources with flux densities higher than 5  @xmath30 .",
    "their flux densities at wavelengths between 7  mm and 18  cm in @xmath144 beams are listed in table [ table : flux_compact_200mas ] and plotted in figure [ figure : sed_snr ] .",
    "we overlay on the measured sed the best fit to a model of a single power law with free - free absorption .",
    "the model results are shown in table [ table : compact_em ] .",
    "about one third of the compact 7  mm sources we detected ( table 1 ) are non - thermal .",
    "these sources have been known for some time and are believed to be snr @xcite .",
    "however , they do not decline with time as expected , so it has been suggested that they may be wind - driven bubbles instead @xcite .",
    "the brightest 7  mm continuum compact source is 43.992 + 59.70 , which has been suggested to be the nucleus of m82 @xcite . on the basis of european vlbi network and vla images , @xcite suggest this source could be a candidate for the agn in m82 based on the jet - like feature , although they detected only the northern part .",
    "the study of two radio oh satellite lines also suggests the oh features of this source could be associated with a circumnuclear disk or torus @xcite .",
    "43.992 + 59.70 is also within 3@xmath145 of the 2  @xmath146 peak of m82 @xcite that is presumably in the center of the mass distribution .",
    "in addition , [ ne ii ] line @xcite , and oh maser kinematics @xcite , molecular gas investigation @xcite , and radio recombination line results @xcite also suggest that this source is close to the dynamical center of m82 , which supports the agn scenario .",
    "the suggestion that 43.992 + 59.70 is an agn can be also tested by looking for variability .",
    "long - term radio flux monitoring by @xcite suggests that the source has a stable flux density , with variability @xmath147 5% , which is the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale calibration .",
    "our 7  mm flux density is about 63% of the archival centimeter - wave sed model s prediction .",
    "it is possible that 43.992 + 59.70 is variable at the current epoch , or that the spectrum is not power law to 7  mm .",
    "a discrepancy from the agn picture is that chandra high resolution x - ray images do not show 43.992 + 59.70 as a strong source .",
    "also , another argument against the agn nature of 43.992 + 59.70 can be based on the recent high resolution vlbi and merlin images of this source @xcite , where it has a resolved round structure , consistent with an snr as suggested by its spectral index ( @xmath148 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the measured 7  mm flux density appears to miss a significant amount of flux density from the sed model of snr , and it is hard to match the 7  mm flux density into the snr picture .",
    "this bright non - thermal source also coincides with a compact @xmath69 and 1.644  [ feii ] emitter .",
    "@xcite modeled the radio emission of non - thermal sources in m  82 , including this one , as wind - driven bubbles .",
    "this scenario hypothesizes that non - thermal synchrotron emitting particles are produced at the shock between the wind of young star clusters and hot bubble gas .",
    "however , @xcite measure the expension velocity of this source to be at 2700 km / s , which is about 50 times higher than the expect wind - driven shell @xcite , and it is more closer to the free - expending snr .    in summary , these three models involving agn , snr , and non - thermal bubble of a young cluster could all explain the strong 7  mm emission of 43.992 + 59.70 . despite some suggestive dynamical evidences ,",
    "the morphology and expansion revealed by the vlbi and merlin work strongly indicate that the source is an snr .",
    "however , the snr scenario could not explain the decline of flux density at 7  mm from the expectation value of sed modeling .",
    "the nature of this source might be still open to debate .",
    "@xcite reported 9 x - ray sources in m82 .",
    "the source cxo m82 j095550.2 + 694047 , or m82 x-1 ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has been categorized as an ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) and a 54 mhz quasi - periodic oscillation has been found in x - ray by @xcite and a possible 62 day x - ray luminosity variation by @xcite .",
    "it is suggested to host an intermediate mass black hole @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made to find a radio counterpart of m82 x-1 .",
    "the source 41.30 + 59.6 or 41.5 + 59.7 has been suggested to be a possible counterpart .",
    "we did not detect a significant radio counterpart of m82 x-1 at 7  mm to a limit of 0.7 mjy / bm .",
    "the seds of the nearby 7  mm sources 40.933 + 58.98 and 41.628 + 58.01 are clearly thermal and are also not candidates for the radio counterpart of m82 x-1 .",
    "the flux density of nonthermal source 41.942 + 57.62 ( 41.9 + 58 in @xcite and @xcite ) at 7  mm is significantly below the power law model ( fig .",

    "this source is known to vary @xcite ; its flux density declines at @xmath4 8.4 ",

    "the cm data listed in table [ table : flux_compact_200mas ] and plotted in figure [ figure : sed_snr ] were obtained before 1996 @xcite . based on the epoch - corrected 1993 values of @xcite for the flux density of 41.942 + 57.62 , and for a spectral index of -0.72 ( from best - fit result without 7  mm data point )",
    ", we estimate that the flux density of 41.942 + 57.62 would have been 8 mjy at 7  mm in 1993 , three times higher than the observed value .",
    "this is consistent with a decline of 8.4%/year found at 5 ghz .",
    "@xcite first reported the supernova sn2004am ( 9:55:46.61 ; + 69:40:48.1 ) , which was classified spectroscopically as type ii @xcite .",

    "the null detection in their merlin observations at 5 ghz on march 9 2004 gave an upper limit of 0.18 mjy / bm ( 3 @xmath30 ) , and suggested that the sn2004am should reach the radio emission peak with a significant delay ( up to about 1 year ) .",
    "we can place a 3  @xmath30 upper limit of @xmath151 mjy / bm to the 7  mm flux density of sn2004am in our observation of 2005 april 03 .",
    "there are at least 7 known sources for which the 7  mm flux density predicted from their cm - wave flux densities should be larger than 1  mjy ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "they are 40.68 + 551 , 43.82 + 628 , 45.41 + 637 , 45.48 + 647 , 46.18 + 677 , 46.52 + 639 , and 47.37 + 680 .",
    "the last four of these are at @xmath153 from the phase center where the noise level is a factor of 2 higher than elsewhere and these may be down in the noise .",
    "sources 40.68 + 551 and 43.82 + 628 are , however , within the central primary beam in a low - noise region .",
    "both 40.68 + 551 and 43.82 + 628 are snr .",
    "source 40.68 + 551 has minor variability in the long term radio continuum flux experiment of @xcite , but no variability of 43.82 + 628 has been reported , and this may be the first indication .    for three of the 7  mm sources ( 39.659 + 55.73 , 43.992 + 59.70 , and 45.153 + 61.34 ) the 7",
    "mm flux densities are stronger at the epoch of our observation ( 2005 ) with @xmath154 beam than at year 2000 - 2001 in the observation of @xcite with a @xmath10 beam .",
    "the flux density differences are not conclusive ( @xmath155 of the c - array ) , but suggest that these sources may be varying .",
    "the latter two sources are believed to be snr , based on their radio seds .",
    "neither of them vary strongly at 6  cm in the 12-year monitoring program of @xcite between 19811992 .",
    "source 39.659 + 55.73 is known to vary at 6  cm , fluctuating 20% continuously during this time period .",
    "but we have characterized this source as an hii  region based on its rising spectrum , and it therefore should not vary .",
    "this source might be associated with a wind - driven bubble , as suggested for the non - thermal sources by @xcite .",
    "we present 7  mm vla continuum maps of the starburst in m82 at two resolutions , 0.2  ( b - configuration ) and 2  ( d - configuration ) .",
    "we recover essentially all of the 7  mm flux density of m82 in the lower resolution d - array map .",
    "an estimated 2/3 of this flux density is thermal free - free emission from the starburst .",
    "we detect less than 10% of the total 7  mm flux density in the high resolution",
    "b - array map , which is sensitive to only bright , compact emission sources .",
    "we identify 14 compact sources greater than 0.5  mjy / bm ( 5@xmath30 ) in the high resolution image , and have constructed seds using archival vla data .",
    "nine of the compact sources are compact hii  regions , with emission measures @xmath156 sizes of @xmath157   pc , and rms densities @xmath158 .",
    "these compact sources are located in regions of heavy visual obscuration , with no associated near - ir continuum counterparts .",
    "this could explain the lack of w - r features in m82 .",
    "our detection limit is @xmath159 , so the smallest of these clusters has @xmath160 o stars , and the largest , @xmath4 1200 o stars ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "the detected compact thermal sources account for @xmath4 6%  of the total 7  mm free - free flux density .",
    "since the maps detect only the most luminous compact hii  regions , this ratio should be higher if fainter ones are taken into account .",
    "we therefore infer that the compact hii  region phase in m82 must last at least 6%  of the hii  region lifetime , @xmath41  myr or longer .",
    "in addition to the compact hii  regions , the high resolution map reveals extended ( 2 , or 30 pc ) regions of free - free emission with @xmath162 .",
    "the comparison of intensity ( em ) and flux ( @xmath7 ) suggests that these regions are likely to be non - spherical in geometry .",
    "we suggest two possibilities , either these regions indicate regions of distributed star formation , with many small hii  regions possibly reflecting enhanced star formation at the ends of the bar in m82 , or these regions are sheet - like structures , possibly caused by winds or supernovae .",
    "we have compared lower resolution 7  mm vla maps to maps of molecular gas tracers and dust .",
    "the good correlation between the 7  mm emission and _ spitzer _",
    "irac channel 4 map ( dominated by @xmath5 pah features ) suggests a relation @xmath163 , for intensities @xmath164 .",
    "this indicates that the pah feature is a good tracer of star formation in m82 , although we obtain a different relation between @xmath7 and the @xmath5 emission than previous work .",
    "the correlation of 7  mm emission and molecular gas tracers ( co and hcn ) at 2  scales is excellent , indicating that the relation of star formation and hcn emission found on global scales by @xcite holds down to gmc scales .",
    "we estimate that the sfe in m82 on gmc scales is @xmath4 110% , similar to galactic values , and that the regions of highest sfe also have the highest fraction of dense ( @xmath165 ) gas .",
