    "the @xmath0 state has been first observed by the belle collaboration in the decay @xmath8 @xcite , and was later confirmed by cdf , d0 and babar @xcite .",
    "this was the first state of an increasing number of candidates for exotic hadrons discovered recently .",
    "the current world average mass is @xmath9 , and the width is @xmath10 at 90% confidence level .",
    "babar collaboration reported the radiative decay mode @xmath11 @xcite , which determines @xmath12 .",
    "further studies from belle and cdf that combine angular information and kinematic properties of the @xmath13 pair , strongly favors the quantum numbers @xmath3 or @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "although the new babar result favors the @xmath15 assignment @xcite , established properties of the @xmath0 are in conflict with this assignment @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we will consider the @xmath0 as being a @xmath3 state .",
    "babar collaboration reported the upper limit of the branching ratio for the production in @xmath16 meson decay @xcite : @xmath17 recently , belle collaboration presented the most precise measurement of the branching fraction @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the decay modes of the @xmath0 into @xmath19 and other charmonium states indicate the existence of a @xmath20 in its content . however the attempts to classify the state in the charmonium spectrum have to deal with the fact that the mass of the @xmath0 is not compatible with any of the possible candidates in the quark model @xcite .",
    "another problem comes from the measurement of the decay rates of the processes @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are comparable @xcite , = 1.00.40.3 , [ ratio ] that could indicate a strong isospin and g parity violation , which is incompatible with a @xmath23 structure .",
    "the coincidence between the @xmath0 mass and the @xmath24 threshold : @xmath25 @xcite , inspired the proposal that the @xmath0 could be a molecular @xmath26 bound state with small binding energy @xcite .",
    "in particular , considering the @xmath0 as an admixture of neutral and charged components of molecules , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the strong isospin violation observed in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) could be explained in a very natural way @xcite .",
    "there is also a possibility that the observed ratio of the @xmath29 decaying into @xmath30 or @xmath31 may not come from a large isospin breaking . in ref .",
    "@xcite the isospin breaking is investigated in the dynamical generation of the @xmath29 as a molecular state , and it is found to be small .",
    "but , considering that the two pion and three pion states comes from the decays of @xmath32 and @xmath33 mesons , the small isospin breaking is compensated by the larger phase space of the @xmath32 meson , thus explaining the experimental data .",
    "another interesting interpretation for the @xmath0 is that it could be a compact tetraquark state @xcite .",
    "the co - existence of both @xmath20 and multiquark components is subject of debate in many works , and it is supported by some experimental data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simulation for the production of a bound @xmath34 state with biding energy as small as 0.25 mev , reported a production cross section that is an order of magnitude smaller than the cross section obtained from the cdf data .",
    "a similar result was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in a more phenomenological analysis . however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a consistent analysis of the @xmath34 molecule production requires taking into account the effect of final state interactions of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 mesons .    besides",
    ", the recent observation , reported by babar @xcite , of the decay @xmath37 at a rate : @xmath38 it is much bigger than the molecular prediction  @xcite : @xmath39    in the framework of the qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) the mass of the @xmath29 were computed with good agreement with data , considering tetraquark @xcite and molecular structures @xcite .",
    "the same success is not found in decay widths calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite the decay width of the modes @xmath6 are calculated for the tetraquark structure , and the result is one order larger that the total width . in ref .",
    "@xcite the qcdsr approach was used to study the @xmath0 structure including the possibility of the mixing between two and four - quark states , where it was successfully applied to obtain the mass of the state and the decays widths for the modes @xmath6 and the radiative decay mode @xmath7 .",
    "this was implemented following the prescription suggested in @xcite for the light sector .",
    "the mixing is done at the level of the currents and is extended to the charm sector . in a different context ( not in qcdsr ) , a similar mixing was suggested already some time ago by suzuki @xcite .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a fluctuation of the @xmath40 state where a gluon is emitted and subsequently splits into a light quark - antiquark pair , which lives for some time and behaves like a molecule - like state    the models for the quark structure can also be applied to study the production of the state in @xmath16 decays .",
    "this subject is studied in different approaches in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on production of the @xmath0 , using the mixed two - quark and four - quark prescription of ref .",

    "the process @xmath1 occurs via weak decay of the @xmath42 quark , while the @xmath43 quark is a spectator .",
    "the @xmath29 meson as a mixed state of molecule and charmonium interacts via @xmath20 component of the weak current .",
    "in effective theory , at the scale @xmath44 , the weak decay is treated as a four - quark local interaction described by the effective hamiltonian ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath45\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 are ckm matrix elements , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are short distance wilson coefficients computed at the renormalization scale @xmath49 .",
    "the four - quarks effective operator is @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "the decay amplitude of the process is calculated from the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , and it can be factorized by splitting the matrix element in two pieces : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and the currents are @xmath54 the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) are parametrized in the following way @xmath55 and @xmath56 the parameter @xmath57 in ( [ 2pmatrix ] ) gives the coupling between the current @xmath58 and the @xmath29 state .",
    "the form factors @xmath59 describe the weak transition @xmath60 .",
    "hence we can see that the factorization of the matrix element describes the decay as two separated sub - processes .",
    "the decay width for the process @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "the invariant amplitude squared can be obtained from ( [ amp ] ) :    @xmath64    we will use qcd sum rules in order to determine the parameter @xmath57 and the form factor @xmath65 , and therefore we can obtain the width of the decay .",
    "the qcd sum rule approach @xcite is based on the two point correlator : @xmath66 where the current @xmath67 is defined in ( [ wcurrents ] ) . for the @xmath29 meson we will follow @xcite and consider a mixed charmonium - molecular current as in ref .  @xcite . for the charmonium",

    "the form factor of the @xmath60 transition matrix ( [ 3pmatrix ] ) can be evaluated from the three point correlator : @xmath101    in the ope side we use the weak current @xmath102 defined in ( [ wcurrents ] ) and the interpolating currents of the @xmath16 and @xmath103 pseudoscalar mesons : @xmath104 we work at leading order in @xmath105 and consider condensates up to dimension 5 and terms linear in the mass of the @xmath106 quark .",
    "the phenomenological side of the sum rule is computed by inserting the intermediate states of the @xmath16 and @xmath103 mesons in the correlator : @xmath107 with @xmath108 , using ( [ 3pmatrix ] ) and the following definitions : @xmath109 performing a double borel transform , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and matching both sides of the sum rule , we get in the structure @xmath112 ( with @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 :    @xmath116    where the perturbative contribution is given by    @xmath117\\,.\\nn\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the integration limit @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the continuum threshold parameters for the @xmath16 and @xmath103 respectively .",

    "we use the following relation between the borel masses @xmath94 and @xmath122 @xcite : @xmath123      the sum rules are analysed numerically using the following values for quark masses and qcd condensates , and for meson masses and decay constants @xcite : [ qcdparam ] & m_b(m_b)=4.7,m_s=0.140 + & = -(0.230.03)^3 ^ 3 , + & m_0 ^ 2=0.8 ^ 2 , + & m_b = 5.279 m_k = 493.677 + & f_b = 0.170 , f_k = 0.160 .",
    "we use the value of the mixing angles @xmath124 and @xmath99 given in ( [ mixangles ] ) . for the continuum threshold parameters we take @xmath125 .    in fig .",
    "[ q2vsm2 ] we show the plot for the form factor @xmath126 calculated in the sum rules from eq .",

    "@xmath128 shown in the plot the sum rule presents a good stability .    in the following analysis , to determine the @xmath127 dependence of the form factor , we choose the borel mass within the region of stability around the mass of the @xmath16 meson , @xmath129 .",
    "we fit ( [ sr3p ] ) within the stable region by matching both sides of the sum rule . in fig .",
    "[ fit.form ] we show , through the dots , the qcdsr results for the form factor @xmath130 as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "the numerical results can be well fitted by a monopolar parametrization ( shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "( [ fit.form ] ) ) : @xmath131 for the decay width calculation , we need the value of the form factor at @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the mass of the off - shell @xmath29 meson",
    ". therefore we have : @xmath134      to determine the the decay width we insert , in the expression ( [ eqwidth ] ) , the parameter @xmath57 ( [ lambdaw ] ) obtained in the two - point sum rule calculation , and the value of the form factor @xmath126 , from the three - point sum rule , at the @xmath29 meson pole ( [ fpluspolo ] ) .",
    "the branching ratio is therefore calculated dividing the result by the total width of the @xmath16 meson @xmath136 : @xmath137 where we have used the mean life of the @xmath16 meson @xmath138 s , the ckm parameters @xmath139 , @xmath140 @xcite , and the wilson coefficients @xmath141 , @xmath142 , computed at @xmath143 and @xmath144 @xcite .",

    "( [ field ] ) , and we get respectively for the pure molecule and pure charmonium : @xmath147 @xmath148 comparing the results for the pure states with the one for the mixed state ( [ result ] ) , we can see that the branching ratio for the pure molecule is one order smaller , while the pure charmonium is larger .",
    "the result for the pure molecular state in eq .",
    "( [ resmol ] ) can be compared with the one from ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "the authors study the production of the @xmath29 as a molecular state in the decay @xmath135 through the coalescence of charm mesons .",
    "the calculation of the branching ratio is strongly dependent on the choice of parameters , and it is found to be of order @xmath149 to @xmath150 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the production of the @xmath29 as a @xmath151 charmonium state is studied in pqcd , and their result for the branching ratio is @xmath152 , which is an order bigger than our result for the pure charmonium ( [ resccbar ] ) .",
    "we have presented a qcdsr analysis of the production of the @xmath0 state considering a mixed charmonium - molecular current in the decay @xmath135 .",
    "we find that the sum rules result in eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) , obtained by using the factorization hypothesis , is smaller , but compatible with the experimental upper limit .",
    "since , it is known that non - factorizable contributions may play an important role in hadronic decays of @xmath16 mesons  @xcite , our result can be interpreted as a lower limit for the branching ratio .    this result was obtained by considering the mixing angles in eqs .",
    "( [ 4mix ] ) and ( [ field ] ) with the values @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the present result is also compatible with previous analysis of the mass of the @xmath29 state and the decays into @xmath155 and @xmath156 @xcite , and the radiative mode @xmath157 @xcite , since the values of the mixing angles used in both calculations are the same .",
    "it is important to mention that there is no new free parameter in the present analysis and , therefore , the result presented here strengthens the conclusion reached in refs .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath0 is probably a mixture between a @xmath23 state and @xmath158 and @xmath75 molecular states . from eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) one may be tempted to say that the @xmath23 component of the state described by such current is dominant ( @xmath15997% ) , like the conclusion presented in ref .",
    "however , from a closer look at eq .",
    "( [ curr2 ] ) , one can see that the @xmath23 component of our current is already multiplied by a dimensional parameter , the quark condensate , in order to have the same dimension of the molecular part of the current .",
    "therefore , it is not clear that only the angle in eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) determines the percentage of each component . to try to evaluate the importance of each part of the current it is better to analyse the results obtained with each component , like the results presented in eqs .",
    "( [ resmol ] ) and ( [ resccbar ] ) . from these results",
    "we see that the @xmath23 part of the state plays a very important role in the determination of the branching ratio . by the other hand , in the decay @xmath160 and @xmath161 ,",
    "the width obtained in our approach for a pure @xmath23 state is @xcite : @xmath162 and , therefore , the molecular part of the state is the only one that contributes to this decay , playing an essential role in the determination of this decay width .",
    "also , for a pure @xmath23 state one gets : @xmath163 from where one sees again that the molecular part of the state plays a very important role in the determination of its mass .",
    "therefore , although we can not determine the percentages of the @xmath23 and the molecular components in the @xmath0 , we may say that both components are extremely important , and that , in our approach , it is not possible to explain all the experimental data about the @xmath0 with only one component .",
