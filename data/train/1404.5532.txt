    "consider a server alternating between two service points . at each service point",
    "there is an infinite queue of customers waiting to be served .",
    "only one customer can occupy each service point .",
    "once a customer enters the service point , his total service is divided into two separate phases .",
    "first there is a preparation phase , where the server is not involved at all .",
    "after the preparation phase is completed the customer is allowed to start with the second phase , which is the actual service .",
    "the customer either has to wait for the server to return from the other service point , where he may be still busy with the previous customer , or he may commence with his actual service immediately after completing his preparation phase",
    ". this would be the case only if the server had completed serving the previous customer and was waiting for this customer to complete his preparation phase .",
    "the server is obliged to alternate ; therefore he serves all odd - numbered customers at one service point and all even - numbered customers at the other .",
    "once the service is completed , a new customer immediately enters the empty service point and starts his preparation phase without any delay . in the above setting",
    ", the steady - state waiting time of the server @xmath3 is given by the lindley - type equation ( see also @xcite ) @xmath4 where @xmath2 and @xmath5 are the steady - state preparation and service time respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that this equation is very similar to lindley s equation .",
    "the only difference between the two equations is the sign of @xmath3 at the right hand side .",
    "lindley s equation describes the relation between the waiting time of a customer @xmath3 and the interarrival time @xmath5 and service time @xmath2 in a single server queue .",
    "it is one of the fundamental and most well - studied equations in queuing theory . for a detailed study of lindley s equation",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein .    the model described by applies in many real - life situations that involve a single server alternating between two stations .",
    "it was first introduced in @xcite , who study a two - carousel bi - directional system that is operated by a single picker . in this",
    "setting , the preparation time @xmath2 represents the rotation time of the carousels and @xmath5 is the time needed to pick an item .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath2 is uniformly distributed , while the pick time @xmath5 is either exponential or deterministic .",
    "the authors are mainly interested in the steady - state waiting time of the picker .",
    "this problem is further investigated in @xcite , where the authors expand the results in @xcite by allowing the pick times to follow a phase - type distribution .    in general",
    ", it is not possible to derive a closed - form expression for the distribution of @xmath3 for every given distribution @xmath6 of @xmath2 ( or @xmath7 of @xmath5 ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors derive an exact solution under the assumption that @xmath5 is generally distributed and @xmath2 follows a phase - type distribution . for the classic lindley - equation , the m / g/1 single server queue is perhaps the most easy case to analyse . the analogous scenario for",
    "our model would be to allow the service time @xmath5 to be exponentially distributed and the preparation time @xmath2 to follow a general distribution . for this model",
    "though , the analysis is not straightforward , as is the case for lindley s equation .",
    "the structure of @xmath6 ( or the lack thereof ) is essential for this model . if @xmath6 belongs to a specific class of distributions , exact computations are possible .",
    "this class of distributions includes at least all distribution functions that have a rational laplace transform and a density on an unbounded support .",
    "both this class and the closed - form expression for the distribution of @xmath3 are described in detail in @xcite .    despite the fact that this class is fairly big",
    ", it does not include all distribution functions .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 is a pareto distribution , the method described in @xcite is inapplicable .",
    "polynomial distributions are another example of distributions that do not belong to this class . however , they are extremely useful , since they can be used to approximate any distribution function that has a bounded support .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to complement the above mentioned results by deriving a closed - form expression of the steady - state distribution of the waiting time , @xmath0 , under the assumption that @xmath5 is exponentially distributed and @xmath2 follows a polynomial distribution . in section [ s : dfw ] we derive @xmath0 under these assumptions . as an application , in section [ s : dfw appr ]",
    "we discuss how one can use this result in order to derive good approximate solutions for @xmath0 when @xmath2 is generally distributed on a bounded support , and we provide error bounds of these approximations .",
    "we conclude in section  [ 4s : numerical results ] with some numerical results .",
    "in this section we derive a closed - form expression of @xmath0 , under the assumption that @xmath5 is exponentially distributed and @xmath2 follows a polynomial distribution . without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath6 has all its mass on @xmath8 $ ] . therefore , let @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",

    "therefore , the integrand at the right - hand side of is nonzero only on @xmath8 $ ] .",

    "let @xmath27 denote the @xmath28-th derivative of a function @xmath29 . then differentiating with respect to @xmath21 yields @xmath30 and in general , for @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 from we have that the @xmath34-th derivative of @xmath25 is given by @xmath35 which implies that for @xmath23 , @xmath36    up to this point , we have differentiated equation a total of @xmath37 times . therefore , we need a total of @xmath37 additional conditions in order to guarantee that any solution to is also a solution to .",
    "since for every value of @xmath21 in @xmath8 $ ] , equations and are satisfied , then we can evaluate all these equations for a specific @xmath21 , say @xmath38 , which provides us with the @xmath37 initial conditions , for @xmath31 , @xmath39 so we now have that equation has a unique solution that satisfies these conditions , along with the normalisation equation .",
    "equation is a homogeneous linear differential equation , not of a standard form because of the argument @xmath40 that appears at the right - hand side .",
    "therefore , we need to proceed with caution",
    ". note that the unknown probability @xmath19 is not involved in .",
    "we shall solve this equation by transforming it into a differential equation we can handle . to this end , substitute @xmath21 for @xmath40 in , to obtain the equation @xmath41 equations and form a system of equations .",
    "now let @xmath42 , \\mbox { } \\mathbf{a_n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0\\\\0 & ( -1)^n\\end{array}\\right ] , \\mbox { and } \\mathbf{j}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0 & 1\\\\1 & 0\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] then the system of equations and can be rewritten as @xmath43 in order to derive the characteristic equation of , we work as follows .",
    "we look for solutions of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 $ ] . substituting this solution into and dividing by @xmath46",
    ", we derive the following linear system that determines @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which is @xmath49 in order for a nontrivial solution to exist , the determinant of the coefficients of @xmath50 and @xmath51 should be equal to zero .",
    "this yields that @xmath52 which is the characteristic equation of .",
    "assume _ for the moment that the characteristic equation has only simple roots , and label them @xmath53 .",
    "it is interesting to note here that since is a polynomial in @xmath54 , then for every root @xmath48 of this polynomial @xmath55 is also a root .",
    "therefore , we shall order the roots so that for every @xmath28 , @xmath56 . by substituting each root into the system",
    ", we obtain the corresponding vectors @xmath57 , @xmath58 . then has the @xmath59 linearly independent solutions @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the general solution of is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 are arbitrary constants .",
    "from we can immediately conclude that the solution to equation that we are interested in , is of the form @xmath63 however , this is not the general solution to",
    ". it does not follow from the derivation of that , for any choice of the coefficients @xmath62 , the linear combination will satisfy , since @xmath64 is not a solution to .",
    "therefore , we substitute into , and by keeping in mind that @xmath56 , we have that for every @xmath58 , @xmath65 these are in fact only @xmath37 relations between the unknown coefficients , since it can easily be shown by using the characteristic equation that the equations for every @xmath28 and @xmath66 are identical . using the relations between the coefficients @xmath62 , one can rewrite as sum of @xmath37 linearly independent solutions to as follows @xmath67 where @xmath68 follows from if we solve for @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the general solution to is given by .",
    "the coefficients @xmath62 , for @xmath70 , and the probability @xmath19 that we still need to determine , follow now from the initial conditions and the normalisation equation .",
    "namely , by substituting to and we obtain a linear system of @xmath71 equations .    note that it is not possible to use the same argument in order to determine the coefficients @xmath62 for _ any _ differential equation of the form , because of its nonstandard form .",
    "here we heavily rely on the fact that we know beforehand that a unique solution exists .",
    "we summarise the above in the following theorem .    [",
    "th : density ] let @xmath6 be a polynomial distribution of the form",
    ". then the waiting time distribution @xmath0 has a mass @xmath19 at the origin , which is given by @xmath72 = 1-\\sum_{i=1}^{2n+2}\\frac{d_i \\zeta_i}{r_i}(e^{r_i}-1),\\ ] ] and has a density @xmath25 on @xmath8 $ ] , given by @xmath73    although the roots @xmath74 and coefficients @xmath62 may be complex - valued , the density and the probability @xmath19 that appear in theorem [ th : density ] will be nonnegative .",
    "this follows from the fact that for every distribution @xmath6 of the preparation time , has a unique solution which is a distribution .",
    "it is also clear that , since the differential equation has real coefficients , then each root @xmath74 and coefficient @xmath62 have a companion conjugate root and conjugate coefficient , which implies that the imaginary parts cancel .    when has roots with multiplicity greater than one , the analysis proceeds essentially in the same way .",
    "for example assume that @xmath75 .",
    "then we first look for two solutions to of the form @xmath76 .",
    "if we find only one ( that always exists ) , then we look for a second solution of the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is again a vector . substituting this solution into",
    ", we obtain a linear system that determines @xmath47 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus we can obtain the general solution to the differential equation .",
    "from this point on , by following the same method , we can formulate a linear system that determines the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath19 , and obtain the solution to .    another method to derive the solution to the integral equation",
    "is through laplace transforms over a bounded interval .",
    "we have illustrated this method in @xcite .",
    "the steps of this method are as follows . by taking the laplace transform of over the interval",
    "@xmath8 $ ] we obtain an expression for the laplace transform @xmath79 of @xmath0 that involves the terms @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "by substituting @xmath82 for @xmath83 we form a system of two equations from which we can obtain @xmath79 .",
    "this step is equivalent to the method we used here , namely forming a system of differential equations for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it emerges that @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are polynomials in @xmath82 .",
    "using the fact that the transform is an analytic function on the whole complex plane , we can deduce that the previous expression is the laplace transform over a bounded interval of a mixture of @xmath59 exponentials .",
    "this method is fairly straightforward ; it is , however , cumbersome and it does not illustrate the special relation between the exponentials with opposite exponents that appear in the density @xmath25 .",
    "the result we have obtained in the previous section comes in handy in some cases where it is necessary to resort to approximations of the waiting time distribution .",
    "we have already proven in @xcite that for any distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath2 there exists a unique limiting distribution @xmath0 for , provided that @xmath90>0 $ ] , although we may not be able to compute it .",
    "some distributions of the preparation time are not suitable for deriving a closed - form expression of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath6 has a bounded support , then we can not readily apply previously obtained results . in @xcite only the case where @xmath6 is the uniform distribution is covered , while the method described in @xcite is not applicable ( since distributions on a bounded support are excluded from the class of distributions that are considered there ) .",
    "therefore , one may consider approximating @xmath6 in order to be able to compute the distribution of the waiting time , which is our main concern .",
    "a reasonable approach is to approximate @xmath6 by a phase - type distribution .",
    "an important reason is that the class of phase - type distributions is dense ; any distribution on @xmath91 can , in principle , be approximated arbitrarily well by a phase - type distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we have shown in @xcite that if @xmath6 is a phase - type distribution , then we can compute explicitly the waiting time distribution @xmath0 .",
    "nonetheless , if @xmath6 has a bounded support , it is more natural and possibly computationally more efficient to fit a polynomial distribution . in the sequel",
    ", we shall discuss how to fit a polynomial distribution to @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a continuous distribution on a bounded support , it is reasonable to choose @xmath92 to be a polynomial distribution .",
    "the famous _ weierstrass approximation theorem _ asserts the possibility of uniform approximation of a continuous , real - valued function on a closed and bounded support by some polynomial .",
    "the following theorem is a more precise version of weierstrass theorem .",
    "it is a special case of the theorem by s.  bernstein that is stated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section vii.2 ) .",
    "[ th : bernstein approx ] if @xmath93 is a continuous distribution on the closed interval @xmath8 $ ] , then as @xmath94 @xmath95 uniformly for @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath97 is also a distribution .",
    "bernstein s theorem states that if @xmath93 is a continuous function , then it can be approximated uniformly in @xmath21 with the polynomial @xmath97 . in other words , for any given @xmath98 , there is an @xmath99 independent from @xmath21 , such that for all @xmath100 , @xmath101 , for all @xmath21 .",
    "it is simple to show that if the function @xmath93 is a distribution on @xmath8 $ ] , then the approximation @xmath102 is also a distribution , since it is continuous , @xmath103 , and , by checking its derivative , we shall show that it is non - decreasing in @xmath21 .",
    "it suffices to note that @xmath104\\\\ & = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1 } x^k(1-x)^{n - k-1}\\frac{n!}{k!(n - k-1)!}\\left[f((k+1)/{n})-f(k/{n})\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression in the square brackets at the right hand side is positive since @xmath93 is a distribution , which implies that @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , @xmath106 , for @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "so , given a continuous distribution @xmath6 that has all its mass concentrated on @xmath8 $ ] , one can compute a polynomial distribution @xmath92 that approximates @xmath6 arbitrarily well by using theorem [ th : bernstein approx ] . in this sense ,",
    "the class of polynomial distributions is dense .",
    "then @xmath107 can be computed by using theorem [ th : density ] .",
    "naturally , after having obtained an approximation of @xmath0 , the first question that follows is to determine how good this approximation actually is .",
    "therefore , we shall obtain an upper bound for the error between the approximated distribution for @xmath3 and the actual one .",
    "error bounds for queueing models have been studied widely .",
    "the main question is to define an upper bound of the distance between the distribution in question and its approximation , that depend on the distance between the governing distributions .",
    "these bounds are obtained both in terms of weighted metrics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and non - weighted metrics ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . an important assumption which is often made in these studies is that the recursion under discussion should be non - decreasing in its main argument .",
    "clearly , in the model we discuss here this assumption does not hold .",
    "because of theorem [ th : bernstein approx ] , we shall limit ourselves to the uniform norm .",
    "let @xmath92 be an approximation of @xmath6 and @xmath107 the exact solution that we obtain in that case for the distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath108 be a random variable that is distributed according to @xmath92 , and let @xmath109 .",
    "define now the mapping ( cf .  )",
    "@xmath110 which yields that @xmath107 is the solution to @xmath111 that can be rewritten in the form ( cf .",
    "( 2.3 ) ) @xmath112 then we can prove the following theorem .",
    "[ th : error bound ] let @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath114)$ ] .",
    "we have that @xmath115\\|{\\mbox{$f_w^{}$}}-{\\mbox{$\\widehat{f}_w^{}$}}\\|+\\|\\mathcal{t}{\\mbox{$\\widehat{f}_w^{}$}}-\\widehat{\\mathcal{t}}{\\mbox{$\\widehat{f}_w^{}$}}\\|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath116 is a contraction mapping with contraction constant @xmath13 $ ] . furthermore , @xmath117 so @xmath118\\|{\\mbox{$f_w^{}$}}-{\\mbox{$\\widehat{f}_w^{}$}}\\|+\\varepsilon$ ] , which is what we wanted to prove .",
    "an important feature of equation that made the calculation of an error bound straightforward is that the distribution of the waiting time is the fixed point of a contraction mapping .",
    "note that this is not a property of lindley s recursion .",
    "this section is devoted to some numerical results . for a given distribution @xmath6",
    "we calculate from theorem  [ th : bernstein approx ] three polynomial distributions ( of first , fifth , and tenth order ) that approximate @xmath6 , and we plot the resulting densities of the waiting time .",
    "the distribution @xmath6 considered is the piecewise polynomial distribution @xmath119 } + ( -2 x^2 + 4 x - 1)\\mathbbm{1}_{[1/2 \\leqslant x\\leqslant 1]}+\\mathbbm{1}_{[x\\geqslant 1]},\\ ] ] where @xmath120}$ ] is the indicator function of the set @xmath121 .",
    "this distribution is simply the well - known symmetric _",
    "triangular _ distribution on @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , we take @xmath122 .      for the above approximations",
    "we have computed the distance between @xmath6 and @xmath92 , @xmath25 and @xmath123 , @xmath0 and @xmath107 , as well as the error bound for @xmath0 and @xmath107 as it is predicted by theorem  [ th : error bound ] . evidently , the error bound that is predicted by theorem  [ th : error bound ] is rather crude . furthermore , the resulting error between @xmath0 and @xmath107 in this case is approximately 3 times smaller than the error incurred between the densities ( which is an expected consequence of @xmath19 ) , and 4.5 times smaller than the initial approximation error between @xmath6 and @xmath92 .",
