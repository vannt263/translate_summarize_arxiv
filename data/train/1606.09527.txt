    "interpolation of data has a notable importance in both numerical analysis and geostatistical communities : in geostatistics , the underlying structure of the data is assumed to be a stochastic process , with the interpolation procedure known as kriging @xcite .",
    "the method is mathematically equivalent to kernel interpolation , a method used in numerical analysis for the same problem , but derived under completely different modelling assumptions .",
    "radial basis functions are well - known and successful tools for the interpolation of data in many dimensions @xcite .",
    "several radial basis functions of compact support that give rise to nonsingular interpolation problems have been proposed , and we cite @xcite and the impressive reviews in @xcite and @xcite , amongst others . in particular , the motivation behind buhmann s @xcite tour de force is to propose radial functions of compact support that also give positive definite matrices and have genuinely banded interpolation matrices ( similarly to the multiquadric and gaussian kernels ) . of such nature",
    "are those ones we will discuss in the present paper . early examples of radial functions with compact support that have a simple piecewise polynomial structure are due to @xcite",
    ". then schaback and wu @xcite , wendland @xcite and finally schaback @xcite established several of their special properties , such as certain optimality facts about their degree and smoothness .",
    "the functions proposed by buhmann are closely related to the so - called multiply monotone radial basis functions as discussed in @xcite .",
    "radial basis functions are known under the name of covariance ( correlation ) functions in the geostatistical community : the use of compactly supported covariance functions has been advocated in a number of papers , and we refer the reader to @xcite , with the references therein , and to @xcite for a recent effort under the framework on multivariate gaussian fields .",
    "covariance functions with compact support represent the building block for the construction of methods allowing to overcome the big data problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "the recent work of @xcite brought even more attention on the role of some classes of compactly supported covariances for asymptotically optimal prediction on a bounded set of @xmath1 . from the cited works it has become apparent that the smoothness at the origin ( intended as even extension ) of a compactly supported and isotropic covariance function plays a crucial role for both estimation and prediction .",
    "wendland functions @xcite have been especially popular , being compactly supported over balls of @xmath1 with arbitrary radii , and additionally allowing for a continuous parameterization of differentiability at the origin , in a similar way to the matrn family ( @xcite ) .",
    "the tour de force in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite puts emphasis on linear operators , called _ monte _ , that allow to increase the smoothness of a given radial function , being positive definite on @xmath1 .",
    "this is done at the expense of losing positive definiteness , which is only achieved on @xmath2 , for @xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 depicts the following situation : dashed lines report wendland functions @xcite with unit compact support , for @xmath4 ( from left to right ) being the parameter that allows to govern differentiability at the origin .",
    "dashed - dotted lines report the respective wendland functions for a compact support equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the functions depicted with continuous lines report their weighted differences ( see equation ( [ del_piero ] ) ) .",
    "we can clearly appreciate that the level of differentiability changes for these last .",
    "this gives a substantial motivation for the present work : we consider the buhmann functions as defined in zastavnyi  @xcite on the basis of @xcite .",
    "this class includes as special case many other classes of compactly supported covariance functions , such as askey @xcite wendland @xcite and missing wendland @xcite functions , as well as the zastavnyi @xcite and trigub @xcite classes . finally , also wu functions @xcite and the celebrated spherical model @xcite are included as special cases .",
    "we show that some parameterized differences of buhmann functions preserve positive definiteness in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean spaces , and we then determine the exact level of smoothness induced by such operation .",
    "we focus throughout on the class @xmath6 of continuous functions @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is positive definite on @xmath9 .",
    "thus , @xmath10 with @xmath11 is the correlation function of some gaussian field .    apparently , the functions @xmath12 are radially symmetric and schoenberg s theorem ( 1938 , see @xcite for a more recent discussion ) uniquely identifies them as scale mixtures of the type @xmath13 with @xmath14 a uniquely determined probability measure , and @xmath15 being the characteristic function of a random vector that is uniformly distributed on the spherical shell of @xmath9 .",
    "daryl and porcu @xcite put emphasis on the measure @xmath14 , termed schoenberg measure there .",
    "it is well known @xcite that any random vector @xmath16 of @xmath9 with characteristic function @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 having @xmath20 as characteristic function , @xmath21 a positive random variable distributed according to @xmath14 , and @xmath19 and @xmath21 are stochastically independent .",
    "the identity above is intended as equality in distribution .",
    "+ the class @xmath6 is nested , with the following inclusion relation @xmath22 being strict ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a function @xmath23 is called completely monotone if it is infinitely often differentiable and @xmath24 , for all @xmath25 and for all @xmath26 .",

    "section 3 exposes the structure of the solution .",
    "we also characterize the smoothness of differences of buhmann functions in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "section 4 illustrates connections with previous literature .",
    "we denote @xmath32 the set of continuous functions on @xmath9 , for @xmath33 let @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "zastavnyi  @xcite ( 2006 ) proposed the following even functions given on @xmath36 : @xmath37 if @xmath38 , then arguments in proposition 1 and theorem 1 in @xcite show , respectively , that @xmath39 if and only if @xmath40 and that @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 if @xmath43 , then @xmath44 , with @xmath45 denoting the beta function .    the functions @xmath46 coincide ( modulo some positive factors ) with the functions @xmath47 introduced by martin buhmann @xcite .",

    "<S> we consider the buhmann class of compactly supported radial basis functions , whih includes a wealth of special cases that have been studied in both numerical analysis and spatial statistics literatures . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the celebrated wu , wendland and missing wendland functions are notable special cases of this class . we propose a very simple difference operator and show the conditions for which the application of it to buhmann functions preserves positive definiteness on @xmath0-dimensional euclidean spaces . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the application of the difference operator increases smoothness at the origin , whilst keeping positive definiteness in the same @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space , as well as compact support . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our operator is a competitor of the celebrated monte operator , which allows to increase the smoothness at the origin , at the expense of losing positive definiteness in the space where the radial basis function is originally defined . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs of our results highlight surprising connections with past literatures on celebrated class of functions . amongst them , absolute and completely monotone functions . </S>",
    "<S> + _ keywords _ : buhmann functions ; compact support ; completely monotonic ; fourier transforms ; laplace transforms . </S>"
