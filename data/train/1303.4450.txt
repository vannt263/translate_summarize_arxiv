    "a pseudo - riemannian nilmanifold is a pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath1 which admits a transitive action by isometries of a nilpotent lie group .",
    "the interest on these manifolds has been renovated in the last years motivated by their applications not only in mathematics but also in physics ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a typical question is the possibility of the extension to the pseudo - riemannian case of several properties already known in the riemannian situation , a topic which could be quite complicated .",
    "flat pseudo - riemannian nilmanifolds were investigated in @xcite ; for non - flat nilmanifolds there are today many open problems .",
    "let @xmath1 denote a riemannian manifold with isometry group @xmath2 .",
    "wolf proved in @xcite that _ if a connected nilpotent lie group @xmath3 acts transitively on @xmath1 then @xmath4 is unique , it is the nilradical of the isometry group , and the transitive action of @xmath4 is also simple . thus @xmath1 can be identified with the nilpotent lie group @xmath4 equipped with a left - invariant metric . furthermore the subgroup @xmath0 of isometries fixing the identity element coincides with the group @xmath5 of isometric automorphisms of @xmath4 and therefore the isometry group is the semidirect product @xmath6 ( * ) _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "later kaplan @xcite studied other isometric actions on a family of 2-step nilmanifolds , namely on @xmath0-type lie groups .",
    "it was shown that the group of isometric automorphisms coincides with the group of isometries of @xmath4 fixing its identity element and the distribution @xmath7 these subbundles are obtained by translation on the left of the splitting at the lie algebra level @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lie algebra of @xmath4 , @xmath10 denotes its center and @xmath11 the orthogonal complementary subspace of @xmath10 .",
    "our goal here is to investigate some lie groups acting by isometries on a fixed pseudo - riemannian 2-step nilpotent lie group : the group of isometries preserving the splitting ( [ dist ] ) , the group of isometric automorphisms and the full isometry group .",
    "we get several results concerning this topic , improving the results in @xcite and we have examples showing difficulties . as noticed recently by wolf et al .",
    "@xcite the question of the structure of the nilradical of the isometry group for a pseudo - riemannian nilmanifold is subtle .",
    "we exhibit a 2-step nilpotent lie group @xmath4 equipped with a left - invariant lorentzian metric such that :    * the group of isometric automorphisms is smaller than the subgroup of isometries fixing the identity element ; * the lie group @xmath4 is not normal into @xmath12 , hence the algebraic structure ( * ) does not hold ; * the action of the nilradical of @xmath12 is not transitive on @xmath4 .",
    "these facts reveal remarkable differences with the riemannian situation . for riemannian 2-step nilmanifolds",
    "it is known that every isometry is  compatible  with the splitting ( [ split ] ) .",
    "geometrically the subspace @xmath11 correponds to negative eigenvalues of the ricci operator while the subspace @xmath13 is described by the non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "we shall see that a similar characterization can not be achieved for a metric with signature .",
    "let @xmath4 denote a 2-step nilpotent lie group equipped with a pseudo - riemannian left - invariant metric .",

    "the group of isometric automorphisms coincides with the group of isometries fixing the identity element and preserving the splitting ( [ dist ] ) ; 2 .",
    "we get conditions to assert the equality @xmath14 so obtaining the structure ( * ) for the full isometry group .",
    "in particular , the family of pseudo-@xmath0-type lie groups satisfies the conditions in _ b. _ however this does not characterize this family .    in the case of degenerate center",
    "the situation is more singular .",
    "we mainly work with bi - invariant metrics on 2-step nilpotent lie groups , showing that _ a. _ above does not hold : there are isometric automorphisms not preserving any kind of splitting ( [ dist ] ) .",

    "in this section we recall some definitions and properties of groups acting by isometries .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the ( full ) isometry group of @xmath15 .",
    "this is a lie group whenever it is equipped with the compact - open topology . since translations on the left are isometries , it is easy to verify that every @xmath17 can be written as a product @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the translation by the element @xmath20 and @xmath21 is an isometry fixing the identity element .",
    "the subgroup of left - translations by elements of @xmath22 is closed in @xmath16 and it is isomorphic to @xmath22 .",
    "the subgroup of isometries fixing the identity element denoted by @xmath0 is also a closed subgroup of @xmath16 and due to ( [ comp ] ) one has @xmath23 let @xmath24 denote the group of automorphisms of @xmath22 and set @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the group of isometric automorphisms of @xmath22 , that is @xmath27 .",
    "since for every automorphism @xmath28 it holds @xmath29 , it follows that the subgroup of translations on the left is a normal subgroup of the group @xmath30 , thus one gets @xmath31    a pseudo - riemannian manifold is called _ locally symmetric _ if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the levi - civita connection and @xmath34 denotes the curvature tensor .",
