    "in 1958 , sendov conjectured that if a polynomial ( with complex coefficients ) has all its roots in the unit disk , then within one unit of each of its roots lies a root of its derivative .",
    "this conjecture has yet to be settled , although it has been the subject of more than 80 papers over the intervening years , and so has been verified for many special cases .",
    "these have been documented by sendov @xcite , schmeisser  @xcite , sheil - small ( * ? ? ?",

    "we will say that a polynomial @xmath3 is _ expected _ if it is of the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 . in 1972 ,",
    "phelps and rodriguez defined a polynomial @xmath5 to be _ extremal _ if @xmath25 , and conjectured ( * ? ? ? * after theorem  5 ) that extremal polynomials are all expected .",
    "since any expected polynomial @xmath3 has @xmath26 , this conjecture implies sendov s conjecture .",

    "@xmath27-neighborhood _ of @xmath5 to be the set of all polynomials @xmath28 whose roots are within @xmath27 of the roots of @xmath3 ( in the sense that the roots of  @xmath29 can be paired with the roots of @xmath3 so that in each pair , the difference of the roots has a modulus less than @xmath27 ) .",

    "it is tempting to approach sendov s conjecture by trying to show that all locally extremal polynomials must be expected .",
    "indeed , schmieder has made several such attempts  @xcite , although borcea has shown @xcite that each contains a technical flaw .    in this paper , we prove    [ theorem1 ] for each @xmath31 , there are locally extremal polynomials @xmath5 of the form @xmath32    note that polynomials of this form would not be expected , as each has a root  @xmath33 that is not on the unit circle .",

    "second , the structure of these polynomials ( in particular , the multiple critical point ) identifies circumstances that potential variational proofs of sendov s conjecture will need to address .",
    "finally , finding these polynomials is a significant new step in identifying all local extrema .    in section [ section2 ]",
    ", we list eight properties that are sufficient for a polynomial to be locally extremal , and in sections [ section3 ] and [ section4 ] we verify that these properties suffice . in section [ section5 ] , we describe how to construct polynomials that satisfy all these properties , and in section [ section6 ] we list the resulting polynomials , thereby verifying theorem  [ theorem1 ] .",
