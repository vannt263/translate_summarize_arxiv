    "since the advent of rare isotope beams ( ribs ) @xcite elastic nucleus - nucleus scattering with a radioactive projectile @xcite is a reaction which has been studied to a large extent in the attempt to find characteristics that would be typical for a weakly bound nucleus and would help understanding new phenomena such as the existence of the halos @xcite .",
    "it has been established that for halo projectiles breakup of the valence particles is responsible for a damping in the elastic angular distribution starting from around 5@xmath0 at medium to high energies .",
    "all theoretical methods used to describe the above mentioned reactions , require at some stage of the calculation the knowledge of the nucleus - nucleus optical potential .",
    "the optical potential is the basic ingredient for the description of elastic scattering , but it is important also in transfer and breakup calculations , since one needs to take into account the core quasi - elastic scattering by the target while the valence neutrons are transferred or breakup .",
    "for example in the case of some two - neutron halo nuclei such as @xmath1be or @xmath2li , their cores of @xmath3be and @xmath4li are themselves weakly bound nuclei . for multinucleon transfer reactions planned in order to obtain heavy exotic nuclei it will be important to have the appropriate optical potentials which include breakup and which should be used in the intermediate steps of the reaction . in the charge exchange reaction @xmath5 the halo nucleus - nucleus optical potential necessary to describe the final channel",
    "@xcite has a volume part obtained with a double folding plus a very diffuse surface term fitted phenomenologically to reproduce the final channel angular distribution .",
    "the effect of the surface potential reduced the absolute cross sections by about 50%@xcite , in accordance with the experimental data and it can be interpreted as due to the halo breakup .    microscopic optical potentials for a halo projectile have already been studied by many authors , and a review of the present situation can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of these methods consists in starting from a phenomenologically determined core - target potential and then to add the effect of the breakup of the halo neutron .",
    "this process leads to adding a surface part to the core - target potential .",
    "this new surface peaked optical potential has been seen to have a quite long range which reflects the properties of the long tail of the halo neutron wave function .",
    "such kind of potentials are often called dynamical polarization potentials @xcite-@xcite .    in a recent contribution we proposed a new approach @xcite to the calculation of the imaginary part of the optical potential due to nuclear breakup .",
    "it is based on a semiclassical method described by broglia and winther in @xcite and used also by brink and collaborators @xcite to calculate the surface optical potential due to transfer and on the bonaccorso and brink model for transfer to the continuum reactions @xcite-@xcite , the idea being that breakup is a reaction following the same dynamics as transfer but leading mainly to continuum final states when the incident energies per nucleon are higher than the average nucleon binding energy .",
    "the calculations were almost completely analytical and a simple , approximated formula was obtained which helped understanding the origin of the long range nature of the potential and its dependence on the incident energy as well as on the initial neutron binding energy .",
    "the characteristics of our potential were consistent with those of potentials obtained with other methods , in particular the eikonal method of canto et al.@xcite and application to the description of experimental data were encouraging @xcite .",
    "however it is very well known that for heavy targets recoil effects which give rise to the so called coulomb breakup , are important and actually dominant for a neutron halo @xcite in the breakup cross section and therefore one wonders what would be their effect on the elastic scattering .",
    "some work has already been published in order to calculate the optical potential due to coulomb breakup at low @xcite,@xcite or intermediate energies @xcite",
    ". however paper @xcite deals with proton halo breakup which , as it has been demostrated in ref.@xcite has to be treated with great care when compared to neutron breakup",
    ". therefore the methods used in @xcite to include breakup in the optical potential are not expected to be applicable to the neutron breakup case .",
    "we will show in this paper that the method used in ref.@xcite can be used in the case of coulomb breakup as well and that the corresponding formalism , which is appropriate to reactions performed at medium to high energies , well above the coulomb barrier , is consistent with and joins continuously to the formalism used by other authors @xcite at lower energies .",
    "the method we use here is the same as in @xcite and it is based on the extraction of an optical potential from the calculation of a phase shift .    the elastic scattering probability is @xmath6 , given in terms of the nucleus - nucleus s - matrix .",
    "we know that @xmath7 in a semiclassical approximation @xcite , the imaginary part of the nucleus - nucleus phase shift @xmath8 is related to the imaginary part of the optical potential by    @xmath9    where the volume potential is responsible for the usual inelastic core - target interaction , while the surface term takes care of the peripheral reactions like transfer and breakup .",
    "@xmath10 is the classical trajectory of relative motion for the nucleus - nucleus collision .    according to @xcite the surface optical potential @xmath11 due to breakup",
    "can be related to the breakup probability by @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the breakup probabilities in the various channels @xmath14 . in order to obtain the surface imaginary potential eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) should be calculated as an identity in the distance of closest approach , which amounts to require that @xmath15 be a local , angular momentum independent function .",
    "we remind the reader that since we are using a semiclassical method , the non locality , which is in principle a characteristic of microscopic optical potentials has been transformed into an energy dependence @xcite .",
    "eq.([1 ] ) can also be derived in a straightforward way from the time dependent scattering schrdinger equation for the elastic channel probability density function in presence of a complex potential @xcite . in the traditional formulation",
    "the index ( i ) stands for stripping and pickup to bound states and in ref.@xcite we extended it to hold for breakup reactions in which the final neutron state is in the continuum .",
    "nuclear breakup of both absorptive and diffractive type was included and here we will include also coulomb breakup . the justification of the use of eq.([1 ] ) to calculate the imaginary potential due to nuclear breakup",
    "was simply given by the analogy between breakup and transfer as expressed by the transfer to the continuum model introduced in refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the formalism for transfer to bound states goes over transfer to the continuum in a natural way if the kinematics of the reaction is taken into account correctly within a time dependent approach which ensures neutron energy conservation .",
    "on the other hand broglia and winter in @xcite pointed out the fact that the same formalism could be extended to include core recoil . in the case of breakup of weakly bound nuclei",
    "we have shown in ref.@xcite that core recoil is responsible for the coulomb breakup and that nuclear and coulomb breakup give rise to negligible interference effects .",
    "therefore we argue here that the imaginary part of the optical potential due to coulomb breakup can also be calculated by eq.([1 ] ) where now one of the @xmath16 probabilities will be that of coulomb breakup of the valence nucleon .",
    "then , using eq.([b ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) , in ( [ a ] ) the nucleus - nucleus s - matrix , in the case of a halo projectile , can be written as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 takes into account all core - target interactions while the term @xmath19 depends only on the halo neutron breakup probability . for a halo nucleus at high incident energy the transfer probability is going to be much smaller than the breakup probability",
    ", therefore the surface potential has been identified here with the breakup potential .",
    "now we discuss the hypothesis leading to eq.([s ] ) .",
    "they have been already discussed in ref.@xcite but we report them here too for the sake of completness .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with reactions performed at energies well above the coulomb barrier where many inelastic channels open at about the same distance of closest approach .",
    "the effect of the breakup is most important at large distances of closest approach ( @xmath20 ) , where it represents the dominant reaction mechanism .",
    "if the breakup probability is needed at smaller impact parameters , then the values calculated by perturbation theory , have to be multiplied by the core survival probability , as discussed in eq.(v.8.1 ) of broglia and winther and also used in relation to halo breakup by several authors .",
    "the effect of all inelastic channels @xmath21 different from the one we are interested in , can be taken into account by introducing a damping factor @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the breakup probability @xmath23 at all distances can be defined as    @xmath24    each elementary inelastic probability @xmath25 and breakup probability @xmath26 is small and @xmath26 in particular , can be calculated in time dependent perturbation theory , as done in @xcite . in reactions with halo projectiles",
    "the damping factor @xmath22 has also been referred to as the core survival probability after the halo breakup or as the core elastic scattering probability .",
    "the breakup probability eq.([2 ] ) integrated over the core - target impact parameter @xmath27 has been widely used in the literature to get breakup cross sections .    in this paper",
    "we will treat both nuclear and coulomb breakup as independent process with the formalism used in ref.@xcite , namely we will calculate nuclear breakup in the eikonal approximation and coulomb breakup in first order perturbation theory . in ref.@xcite",
    "we showed that this is appropriate for a one neutron halo since the interference effects are small and the higher order effects in coulomb breakup are negligible .",
    "this has been confirmed by recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "the case of a proton halo or a two - neutron halo might need the full all - order approach .",
    "then the total breakup probability will be given by @xmath28      the optical potential due to nuclear breakup was extensively discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we report here on some of the most important results which will help us also constructing the potential for the coulomb breakup channel .",
    "the nuclear breakup probability given by the eikonal model is    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the spectroscopic factor for the initial state .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the core - target and the neutron - core impact parameters respectively .",
    "the calculation of the nuclear breakup probability is done here in a reference frame with the center at the origin of the target .",
    "it is important to remark that the above expression takes into account to all orders the neutron target final state interaction via an eikonal s - matrix . in this way",
    "neutron elastic scattering and absorption on the target are treated consistently .",
    "the integrand in eq.(7 ) is surface peaked and goes rapidly to zero at the interior of the projectile potential ( cf .",
    "fig.5 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this is because of the natural cuts introduced by @xmath33 and because of the large values of @xmath27 .",
    "thus the initial wave function is needed only at large radii and it can be approximated by its asymptotic form which is an hankel function @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the asymptotic normalization constant .",
    "its one - dimensional fourier transform reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the divergency in the rhs of eq.([2a ] ) is compensated in eq.([dpde ] ) by the rapid decrease of the terms depending on @xmath38 .",
    "eq.([dpde ] ) is the neutron breakup probability from a definite single particle state of energy @xmath39 , momentum @xmath40 , and angular momentum @xmath41 in the projectile to all possible final continuum state of energy @xmath42 with respect to the target and momentum @xmath43 . in our notation @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are the @xmath46 components of the neutron momentum in the initial and final state , respectively .",
    "@xmath47 is the modulus square of the transverse component of the neutron momentum .",
    "recoil effects on the neutron are thus taken into account .",
    ".energy dependent optical model parameters for the n - pb interaction , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ xxxx ]",
    "in conclusion we have presented a simple analytical method to obtain the surface component of the imaginary part of the nucleus - nucleus optical potential to be used in the elastic scattering calculations between a halo or weakly bound nucleus and a heavy target .",
    "the surface potential is due to coulomb and nuclear breakup .",
    "the main purpose here was to relate the characteristics of the potential to the special properties of the breakup channels for weakly bound nuclei . at high incident energy ( @xmath52 20a.mev ) the evaluation of the potentials amounts in fact just to the calculation of the breakup probability as already shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "if breakup from core excited states is to be included , then it suffices to sum up the relative probabilities according to eq.([1 ] ) .",
    "the method to include coulomb breakup is an extension of that previously used to calculate microscopically the effect of transfer and nuclear breakup channels on the imaginary potential .",
    "the shape of the surface imaginary potential and its parameters are determined univocally by the shape of the breakup probability .",
    "an interesting result is that the diffuseness of the potential for the nuclear breakup reflects the decay length of the valence neutron wave function and therefore it depends mainly upon the projectile structure , but not so much on the reaction dynamics . for the coulomb breakup",
    "there is instead a strong dependence on the dynamics which leads to an increase of the diffuseness value when increasing the incident energy .",
    "the strength is also energy dependent .",
    "analytical calculations contained in appendix a have shown that the potential proposed here is consistent with and can be viewed as an extension to high energy , of other theoretical models developed at energies close to the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations on the other hand show consistency with the works of other authors @xcite for similar , light halo systems .",
    "furthermore we have given an explicit justification for the long range of the polarization potential .    from feshbach @xcite formalism it is known that related to the imaginary potential , which comes from the second order , complex term , there is also a real correction to be added to the first order term , the folding potential",
    ". however it has been shown by the authors of ref.@xcite that the coulomb excitation polarization potential is purely imaginary at high energy .",
    "on the other hand for the nuclear breakup potential , we have shown in ref.@xcite that the second order real correction is small and negligible , while other calculations @xcite for @xmath53 projectile found a not so small real polarization potential . to make sure that the second order real correction is negligible also for heavy targets such as @xmath54pb",
    ", we have added phenomenologically a real repulsive part to our microscopically calculated imaginary potential , with the same exponential form , same diffuseness and variable strength , but we found no noticeable differences in the angular distributions .",
    "two open questions remain then to be addressed for future work .",
    "one is which observable will be more sensitive to the real correction term .",
    "the other is a systematic microscopic calculation of such a term for a number of different systems and energies .",

    "@xcite reads @xmath56 where both @xmath57 and @xmath58 depend on the incident energy and on the classical trajectory of relative motion . in our case",
    "such a trajectory is a straight line since our approach applies to incident energies well above the coulomb barrier .",

    "@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 are the well known coulomb integrals @xcite which can be expressed in terms of bessel functions of imaginary order .",

    "for @xmath57 we remark that it is well known and shown for example in fig.1 of ref.@xcite that @xmath65 is much smaller than @xmath66 for values of @xmath67 , which happens for heavy ions at high energies .",
