    "hence , the locked states of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) are given by equilibria @xmath51 .",
    "the remaining equilibria @xmath52 are unstable saddle equilibria .",
    "in order to consider the lock - in range of pll - based circuits let us discuss the global asymptotic stability . _",
    "if for a certain @xmath24 any solution of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) tends to an equilibrium , then the system with such @xmath24 is called globally asymptotically stable _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . to prove the global asymptotic stability of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) two approaches can be applied : the phase plane analysis @xcite and construction of the lyapunov functions @xcite .    by methods of the phase plane analysis , in @xcite the global asymptotic stability of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) for any @xmath24",
    "is stated .",
    "however , to complete rigorously the proof given in @xcite , the additional explanations are required ( i.e. , the absence of heteroclinic trajectory and limit cycles of the first kind ( see fig .",
    "[ ris : cyclesphaseplane ] ) is needed to be explained ; e.g. , for the case of lead - lag filter a number of works @xcite is devoted to the study of these periodic trajectories ) .        to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "the methods of the lyapunov functions construction can be applied .",
    "the modifications of the classical global stability criteria for cylindrical phase space are developed in @xcite .",
    "the global asymptotic stability of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) for any @xmath24 can be using the lyapunov function @xmath53",
    "since the considered model of pll - based circuits in the signal s phase space is globally asymptotically stable , it achieves locked state for any initial vco phase @xmath54 and filter state @xmath55 .",
    "however , the phase error @xmath42 may substantially increase during the acquisition process . in order to consider the property of the model to synchronize without undesired growth of the phase error @xmath42 , a lock - in range concept",
    "was introduced in @xcite : `` _ if , for some reason , the frequency difference between input and vco is less than the loop bandwidth , the loop will lock up almost instantaneously without slipping cycles . the maximum frequency difference for which this fast acquisition is possible",
    "is called the lock - in frequency _ '' .",
    "the lock - in range concept is widely used in engineering literature on the pll - based circuits study ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "remark , that it is said that cycle slipping occurs if ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath56 for ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) with fixed @xmath24 a domain of loop states for which the synchronization without cycle slipping occurs is called the lock - in domain @xmath57 ( see fig .  [",
    "ris : cycleslipping ] ) .",
    "however , in general , even for zero frequency deviation ( @xmath58 ) and a sufficiently large initial state of filter ( @xmath55 ) , cycle slipping may take place , thus in 1979 gardner wrote : _",
    "`` there is no natural way to define exactly any unique lock - in frequency '' _ and _ `` despite its vague reality , lock - in range is a useful concept '' _ @xcite . to overcome the stated problem , in @xcite the rigorous mathematical definition of a lock - in range",
    "is suggested :    @xcite _ the lock - in range of model ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) is a range @xmath59 such that for each frequency deviation @xmath60 the model ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) is globally asymptotically stable and the following domain @xmath61 contains all corresponding equilibria @xmath62 [ def : lockin ] _    for model ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) each lock - in domain from intersection @xmath63 is bounded by the separatrices of saddle equilibria @xmath64 and vertical lines @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the behavior of separatrices on the phase plane is the key to the lock - in range study ( see fig .  [",
    "ris : lockinphaseplane ] ) .",
    "consider an approach to the lock - in range computation of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) , based on the phase plane analysis . to compute the lock - in range of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) we need to consider the behavior of the lower separatrix @xmath66 , which tends to the saddle point @xmath67 as @xmath68 ( by the symmetry of the lower and the upper half - planes , the consideration of the upper separatrix is also possible ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 shifts the phase plane vertically . to check this",
    ", we use a linear transformation @xmath69 .",
    "thus , to compute the lock - in range of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) , we need to find @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is called a lock - in frequency ) such that ( see fig .  [ ris : lockinphaseplane ] ) @xmath72     of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) . ]    by ( [ eq : lockinrelation ] ) , we obtain an exact formula for the lock - in frequency @xmath71 : @xmath73     for various @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    numerical simulations are used to compute the lock - in range of ( [ sys : pllsys ] ) applying ( [ eq : lockinrelationnew ] ) . the separatrix @xmath77 is numerically integrated and the corresponding @xmath71 is approximated .",
    "the obtained numerical results can be illustrated by a diagram ( see fig .  [",
