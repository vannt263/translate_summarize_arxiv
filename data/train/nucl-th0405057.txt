    "effective field theories ( eft ) are a powerful tool to deal with non - perturbative low energy physics . over the last years , they have provided promising results as regards a systematic and model independent understanding of hadronic and nuclear physics .",
    "the scale separation between long and short distance physics makes the development of a systematic power counting possible .",
    "after the original proposal of weinberg s  @xcite to design a power counting based on applying chpt to the potential many works have followed implementing such a counting  @xcite with finite cut - offs or proposing a counting in the renormalized s - matrix  @xcite which has also been pursued to nnlo  @xcite .",
    "the relation of both the weinberg ( w ) and kaplan - savage - wise ( ksw ) counting has been understood as perturbative expansions about infrared fixed points in the limit of small and large scattering lengths  @xcite respectively ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on long range forces in that context ) . for systems with a large scattering length",
    "as it turns out to be the case in low energy nn scattering , the weinberg counting may be modified to iterate the scattering length to all orders , but then the connection to chpt must be given up  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the ksw counting , although systematic , does not converge at nnlo  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a new counting ( bbsvk ) involving also the chiral limit should be invoked . according to these authors",
    ", one should treat non - perturbatively the nn potential in the chiral limit and consider finite pion mass corrections perturbatively on top of that .",
    "for a recent and more complete review on these and related issues see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    in order to properly define a truly eft three essential requirements must be met .",
    "firstly , one needs a power counting scheme , i.e. a dimensionless expansion parameter , which controls _ a priori _ the accuracy of a calculation and provides an error estimate of the neglected terms .",
    "the second requirement is the mathematical need for a regularization method and subsequent renormalization scheme which is consistent with the physical power counting , independent on any ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "finally , there is the question of practical convergence , which can only be decided _ a posteriori _ on the light of practical calculations .",
    "the issue of regularization and renormalization in the present context is not at all trivial , particularly if the power - counting scheme involves summing up some infinite set of diagrams .",
    "there are well known examples in the literature that shows that not all regularization methods comply to the physical power counting , like e.g. @xmath4 scattering for relativistic baryons in dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "such an approach is not consistent with the non - relativistic limit in the case of heavy baryons .",
    "one has to either device a specific scheme , the so - called infrared regularization  @xcite , or to make a non - relativistic limit first and introduce dimensional regularization afterwards  @xcite . in the context of nn scattering",
    "it has also been shown  @xcite that the renormalized scattering amplitude for a theory without pions with a contact and a derivative term , i.e. a truncated potential , depends on whether one uses a cut - off regularization or dimensional regularization as an intermediate step of the calculation .",
    "the problem was latter understood by using other subtraction schemes than the @xmath5 in dimensional regularization , the so - called power divergence scheme ( pds )  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for off - shell ( os ) subtraction schemes . )    as usual in field theory , one essential ingredient in the whole construction is the choice of an appropriate regulator , which may eventually be removed . in perturbation theory ,",
    "there are many such regulators , like e.g. dimensional regularization . beyond perturbation theory , like in the two body scattering problem one can use those regulators within an order by order analysis aiming at finite renormalized scattering equation . for potentials which are purely short range , i.e. , contact terms and derivative corrections there - off , this problem has successfully been tackled .",
    "the problem becomes subtle when , in addition , long range forces are added .",
    "typically , these long range potentials develop some strong singularity at short distances .",
    "the paradigm of the problem is probably best exemplified by the @xmath1 channel with one pion exchange ( ope ) potential .",
    "on the one hand , the regular ope alone produces a finite scattering amplitude . on the other hand the short range potential",
    "is infinite but renormalizable , and hence a finite scattering amplitude can be built according to the standard principles of renormalization theory .",
    "this suggests , as it turns out to be the case , that the problem may still be renormalizable within a scheme where the long range potential is treated perturbatively . whether or not this mathematical requirement is physically justified has been the subject of much debate in the recent past , with a negative answer after the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite ; iterated ope contributions to scattering observables are not small in the triplet @xmath6 channel . the reason may be found in the singular and attractive @xmath7 nature of the tensor contribution to the ope potential .",
    "the mathematical problem actually arises when both short and long range potentials are added and none of them can be considered small ; there seems no obvious way to renormalize the scattering equation non - perturbatively . by this",
    "we mean regularizing the equations first and removing the regulators afterwards , or at least make the mass scale of the regulator much larger than any other mass scale in the problem .",
    "the main interest in making such a non - perturbative renormalization is that any perturbative scheme can be thought of as an approximation to renormalized equations .",
    "the non - perturbative renormalization of nn interaction in the singlet @xmath1 and triplet @xmath6 channels has been studied several times in the literature by different regularization methods . in ref .",
    "@xcite a subtraction method was developed for the lippmann - schwinger equation to construct a finite @xmath8 matrix for contact interactions added to ope .",
    "renormalization is indeed achieved by taking the subtraction scale to be much larger than any other mass scale and checking for independence of results in this limit .",
    "the resulting description of the @xmath1 phase shift is only valid to very low energies , requiring for inclusion of derivative terms .",
    "unfortunately , the method has not been extended to that case .",
    "derivative interactions can be included within a tree - dimensional cut - off regularization  @xcite . actually , in the cut - off regularization analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite a strong breaking of angular momentum is observed unless either a vanishing bare mixing coupling is chosen or a ( according to the authors ) unlikely fine tunning sets in for a non - trivial fixed point .",
    "we will show below that indeed the bare mixing vanishes but not in an uniform way , but rather following a limit cycle pattern . inspired by the n / d method , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite makes a re - summation of the ksw amplitudes introducing a on - shell potential to which chiral counting is applied .",
    "a new parameter , which is considered to be of order zero in the chiral counting is introduced .",
    "the dynamical origin of this parameter is unclear .",
    "the non - perturbative dimensional regularization of the ope potential with derivative interactions has been studied in coordinate space  @xcite as well as in momentum space  @xcite in the @xmath1 channel . in both cases",
    "a three - parameter fit can be achieved with no explicit two pion exchange contribution up to cm momentum as large as @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite opens up some hope as how the triplet @xmath6 channel might also be renormalized non - perturbatively within dimensional regularization , but so far there are no practical calculations .",
    "the early finite sharp cut - off momentum space treatments of ref .",
    "@xcite have been improved by implementing a better regularization scheme  @xcite which allows to make take larger cut - off values , yet finite .",
    "more recent works supporting the w - counting have also appeared  @xcite .    from a diagrammatic point of view momentum space treatments based on the lippmann - schwinger equation are more natural within a lagrangian framework and allow explicit consideration of nonlocal potentials . on the other hand , the long range nn potentials making use of chiral symmetry constraints are local , and for those the analysis of non - perturbative renormalization in coordinate space becomes much simpler , as will be shown along this work .",
    "in addition , the schrdinger equation is a second order operator and mixed boundary conditions define a complete and unique solution of the scattering problem in the whole space at both sides of the boundary .",
    "this sharp boundary separation of the space is naturally formulated in coordinate space for a local potential .",
    "boundary conditions for nn scattering were used many years ago ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and there has been renewed interest motivated by the developments within eft  @xcite . actually , the thorough analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that in the absence of long range forces a low momentum expansion of the potential within eft framework for the lippmann - schwinger equation is completely equivalent to an effective range expansion ( ere ) and also to an energy expansion of a generic boundary condition at the origin in coordinate space for the schrdinger equation .",
    "moreover , the reference partial wave analysis of the nijmegen group  @xcite uses this method to successfully describe the a large nn scattering data base , when long range potentials are used . while in the first works phenomenological potentials where used , more recent studies consider potentials deduced from chpt theory with a rather satisfactory description of the experimental scattering data  @xcite . the minimal boundary radius which can still provide an acceptable @xmath10 is about @xmath11 .",
    "obviously , if the radius can not be lowered without spoiling the quality of the fit , the short distance cut - off becomes an indispensable parameter of the theory , which can not be removed .",
    "the corresponding momentum space cut - off @xmath12 is comparable to the one needed in early momentum space treatments  @xcite . within the spirit of an eft it would actually be more appropriate to take instead larger @xmath13 s or equivalently shorter @xmath14 s and to check for insensitivity of results in the low energy regime .",
    "thus , there arises the natural question whether in fact this eft procedure can be implemented .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we showed that for the @xmath15 singlet channel with ope the boundary radius can be effectively removed without spoiling a good description of the corresponding phase shift up to the a priori expected cm momentum of @xmath16 where the two pion exchange ( tpe ) effects should start playing a role . the first order differential equation satisfied by the boundary condition of the problem defined in the interval @xmath17 as a function of the boundary radius was very helpful , since the whole problem could be mapped into a variable phase equation  @xcite of a truncated potential in the region @xmath18 with a non - trivial initial condition at the origin , encoding the short distance physics . in this way",
    ", the long range pions could be eliminated and the evolution of the threshold parameters as a function of the boundary radius could be determined non - perturbatively . actually ,",
    "a trivial ultraviolet fixed point limit for the scattering length was found non - perturbatively . remarkably , this behaviour coincides with the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite within a perturbative treatment .",
    "this trivial fixed point at the origin implies a fine tuning of the short distance physics in order to reproduce the physical scattering length . in this paper",
    "we want to extend our results for the interesting case of the triplet @xmath6 channel .",
    "the solution of the boundary condition problem requires solving a coupled set of schrdinger equations . instead of doing so , we prefer to directly compute the change of the boundary condition by an equivalent variable phase approach  @xcite with non - trivial initial conditions which encode the short distance physics  @xcite .",
    "this provides , in addition , a direct and quite transparent connection to renormalization group ideas  @xcite .",
    "related works in spirit to the present are those of refs .  @xcite and @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite a square well potential is used to regulate the short distance behaviour simulating a smeared delta function .",
    "the renormalization group flow for the potential strength is not uniquely defined .",
    "this phenomenon is also found in the theory of self - adjoint extensions of the schrdinger operators  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a delta shell regulator located at a finite distance is assumed as the short distance potential whereas the long distance piece is solved exactly using a distorted wave basis .",
    "this formalism has been so far used to the study of renormalization of repulsive singular potentials ( like @xmath19 ) .",
    "the reason may have to do with the need for a well defined renormalization at the origin .",
    "a common feature of both regularization schemes is that the wave function at the origin is uniquely determined by the regularity condition , @xmath20 .",
    "the boundary condition regularization that we use in this paper provides a uniquely defined renormalization group flow  @xcite , to treat both repulsive and attractive singular potentials  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the boundary condition admits a simple physical interpretation : it can be mapped into a variable phase shift problem  @xcite with a truncated potential .",
    "this interpretation directly provides the non - perturbative renormalization flow of low energy parameters and a quite transparent analysis of both infrared as well as ultraviolet fixed points and limit cycles  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze precisely how the energy dependent boundary condition must change as we move the boundary radius for fixed energy to achieve independence of physical observables such as scattering phase shifts . by doing",
    "so we are effectively changing the hilbert space since the wave function in the outer region is defined only from the boundary to infinity .",
    "an advantage of this procedure is that we never need to invoke off - shellness explicitly ; at any step we are dealing with an on - shell problem .",
    "in addition , we work directly with finite quantities and no divergences appear at any step of the calculation when the boundary radius is taken to zero from above .",
    "another advantage of our construction , as it will become clear along the paper , is that we only need the potentials and physical threshold parameters as input of the calculation ( the cut - off dependence is removed completely , so this is not a parameter ) .",
    "this implies , in particular , that given this information we never have to make a fit ( except perhaps for the determination of the threshold parameters ) ; our calculations are predictions for the phase shifts that are consistent , by construction , with a low energy expansion up to a given order .",
    "thus , the potential danger of compromising the low energy fit due to a global fit up to @xmath21 may be precluded from the start .",
    "this is at difference with the standard way of proceeding where the low energy parameters are fitted to the phase shifts and the threshold parameters are then recomputed . actually , our analysis is equivalent to making a fit only in the low energy region , where explicit pions do not contribute , and predicting the intermediate energy region .",
    "we believe this is a possible and practical way of learning about the role of explicit pions in the nn interaction . actually , our motivation was partly to see whether ope can actually be seen in low partial waves in the intermediate energy region @xmath22 .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the ope potential ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) which reads @xmath25 with ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the nucleon mass , @xmath30 the pion mass , @xmath31 the pion weak decay constant and @xmath32 the nucleon axial coupling constant . in the numerical calculations below",

    "the point of view we take in the present work is that of an eft ; low energy physics should not depend on the detailed knowledge of the interaction at short distances .",

    "a way of avoiding the unbound variation of the scattering lengths consists of going to the origin stepwise through some envelope subsequence defined by a fixed condition for @xmath194 .",

    "actually , any of the choices corresponds to a different starting condition at infinity , modulo a cycle .",
    "conversely , if we go to very short distances , where the scattering lengths vary wildly ; any tiny perturbation there results in a completely different value at infinity .",
    "so , we see again that an extreme fine tunning of the threshold parameters at short distances is required .",

    "( [ eq : va_c ] ) can be numerically solved .",
    "given the fact that as we approach the origin the tensor part of the potential develops a singularity it is important to carefully check for numerical accuracy at short distances .",
    "a crucial property which must be fulfilled by any algorithm is that of exact reversibility ; i.e. evolving upwards or downwards should be inverse operations of each other .",
    "this is an stringent test and , moreover , the only way to make sure that when the long range piece of the potential is switched on for the k - matrix integration we have consistency with the effective range expansion up to the relevant order ( see also below ) .",
    "we prefer to impose this reversibility exactly , independently on the number of mesh points used in the integration , so that any numerical irreversibility is merely attributable to computer arithmetic round - off errors .",
    "this feature will prove extremely relevant when computing the phase shifts below since our calculation requires upwards integration from lower distances .",
    "in all calculations presented in this paper we have checked that the correct threshold behaviour is obtained .",
    "quite generally , we find stable results when we take the long distance cut - off to be @xmath204 . on the other hand",
    "the lowest radius we can achieve numerically and preserving reversibility is @xmath205 , mainly due to computer arithmetic round - off errors triggered by the singularity of the potential .",
    "one could further lower the radius by a semi - classical approximation as outlined in sect .",
    "[ sec : short ] since as the origin is approached the wave function undergoes an increasing number of oscillations and wkb methods can be applied .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see below , for our short distance cut - off the phase shifts for cm momenta up to @xmath206 are rather stable numerically .",
    "the strong dependence of the low energy threshold parameters on the short distance cut - off provides a clue to the fact that there seems to be a lower finite limit for the boundary radius @xmath207  @xcite with still an acceptable fit ; if the boundary radius is lowered , the parameters encoding the short distance boundary condition which are used as fitting parameters depend in a non - smooth way on @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the strong singularity at the origin triggers a fine tuning in those parameters . according to our previous discussion ,",
    "this short distance fine tuning of low energy parameters is absolutely necessary to comply with the independence of the scattering amplitude on the short distance boundary radius .",
    "for such a situation , a fit based on successive adiabatic changes of @xmath14 becomes impractical since the fitting parameters do not change adiabatically and also because these parameters should have to be determined to extraordinary high precision .",
    "in addition , the way how the limit @xmath208 should be taken differs from channel to channel .",
    "our method provides a practical way to overcome the difficulty , given the fact that the boundary radius is taken exactly to zero along the renormalization trajectories while keeping the low energy threshold parameters at fixed values .      in fig .",
    "( [ fig : threshold_evol ] ) we show our results for the evolution of the threshold parameters @xmath170 , @xmath147 and @xmath209 in the singlet @xmath1 and triplet @xmath152-without mixing ( i.e. neglecting the tensor force ) channels .",
    "the main difference one can appreciate from the comparison of both channels is that while the scattering length for the @xmath1 channel exhibits a monotonic trend towards the origin , the scattering length in the @xmath152 channel diverges at a distance of about @xmath210 .",
    "the interpretation of this fact in our framework is clear ; the central part of the ope potential is purely attractive .",
    "thus , by eliminating the pions down to a certain distance , we are effectively building some repulsion , until we lose a bound state .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that as we switch on the ope potential from the origin up to certain distance we can accommodate a bound state above @xmath210 . with this interpretation in mind",

    "the cycles in @xmath126 and @xmath127 are hardly seen in the plot due to a low resolution @xmath203 compared with the typical cycle spacing .",
    "the standard way of proceeding would be to determine the low energy constants or , equivalently , the short distance parameters directly from a fit to the data in a large energy range ( say up to @xmath220 where the two pion exchange left cut opens up should start contributing ) for the theory with ope .",

    "this means that in the latter case there is not a monotonous trend at short distances . a direct consequence of having both ultraviolet fixed points and",

    "actually , in the @xmath1 and @xmath152-without mixing channels the effect is found to be compatible with a perturbative treatment . in the @xmath6 channel",
    "the effect is a bit more complicated due to the presence of ultraviolet limit cycles triggered by the singular character of the tensor potential ; the coupled channel amplitudes are non - perturbatively renormalizable while they become perturbatively non - renormalizable .",
    "this makes a naive perturbative treatment slightly more subtle .",
    "one of the advantages of having a renormalizable theory is that non - perturbative equations make sense , and any perturbative treatment should arise as a controllable approximation to the full equations .",
