    "the exciton formed by an electron and a hole is one of the very important objects in both experimental and theoretical physics of semiconductor heterostructures and graphene .",
    "the study of the excitonic system and its properties is necessary because of potential applications in electronics and photonics , including , design of thresholdless lasers , optical computing and quantum computing @xcite . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "an exciton is a two - body system and to address the problem we have to solve a two - body problem in semiconductor heterostructures or graphene .",
    "let us mention that the problem of the interaction between two particles is very important for the deep analysis of the many - body physics in excitonic system .",
    "the analysis of the spectrum of collective excitations necessary to study such many - body phenomena in the excitonic system as bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity  @xcite requires the solution of two - body problem for a single exciton .",
    "the temperature of kosterlitz - thouless phase transition corresponding to the superfluidity depends on the density of the superfluid component  @xcite .",
    "this density of the superfluid component is defined by the two - particle green function of weakly interacting excitons . the problem to find the two - particle green function of the interacting excitons requires one - particle green function of non - interacting excitons , which is defined by the wave function and energy dispersion of a single exciton  @xcite .",
    "the collective properties and superfluidity of excitons and polaritons in gapped graphene have been studied in refs .  .",
    "therefore , it is of fundamental and practical interest to focus on solution of two - body problem in semiconductor heterostructures and graphene .",
    "finding solution of two - body problem in gapped graphene layers is the subject of this paper .    to describe the formation of an exciton in semiconductor heterostructures like quantum wells the standard quantum mechanical approach is used based on schrdinger equation . in this case",
    "the two - body problem with a scalar action - at - a - distance inter - particle potentials is completely understood and developed both in configuration or momentum three dimensional as well as two dimensional ( 2d ) spaces @xcite .",
    "the notions of absolute time and absolute space allow us to describe the two particles of masses @xmath1and @xmath2 with euclidean position vectors @xmath3and @xmath4 and momenta @xmath5and @xmath6 in an inertial frame .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that in the covariant mechanics , the most straightforward solution of the classical problem with scalar interaction is obtained by a transformation from the individual particle coordinates @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath5 , @xmath9 to the covariant center - of - mass and relative coordinates . using canonical transformation    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a total mass of the system , we can separate the decoupled center - of - mass from the relative motion in configuration or momentum space . in these coordinates ,",
    "the nontrivial motion of the system of two particles occurs entirely in the reduced problem of one body motion and motion of the center - of - mass . _",
    "_  _ _ the total hamiltonian of the system can be presented as a sum of two parts .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 governs the relative motion of two particles and , when the schrdinger equation with this hamiltonian have been solved , the wave function of the relative motion of two particles is obtained .",
    "today graphene has been attracting a great deal of experimental and theoretical attention because of unusual properties in its band structure  @xcite .",
    "graphene is a two - dimensional layer of carbon atoms , where the atoms form honeycomb lattice @xcite . in the low - energy limit the low energy excitations in graphene",
    "are described not by the schrdinger equation but instead in graphene electron and holes behave as relativistic massless particles described by a dirac - like equation for massless and chiral particles @xcite , which is known as weyl equation .",
    "many of the unusual properties of graphene arise from the fact that its quasiparticles are described by dirac spinors . since electron and holes in graphene are governed by the weyl equation they have an intrinsic degree of freedom that resembles the spin degree of freedom in the original weyl equation .",
    "this degree of freedom is called pseudospin in order to distinguish it from the spin and is described by the pauli matrices . in connection to the pseudospin",
    ", there is a good quantum number - the chirality that is defined to be the projection of the 2-momentum operator on the direction of the pseudospin .",
    "clearly , the electrons will have positive chirality and the holes will have negative chirality . also the fermi speed @xmath16 m / s that is around 300 times slower than speed of light replaces the speed of light in the original weyl equation .",
    "the positive - energy solutions of this 2d equation describes electrons , whereas the negative - energy solutions describes holes .    a 2d exciton which is a bound state of an interacting electron and hole in gapped graphene presents a two - body system and it is a fundamental and practical interest to focus on solution of two - body problem in graphene .",
    "graphene consists of two equivalent carbon sublattices and quantum - mechanical hopping between the sublattices leads to the formation of two energy bands , and their intersection near the edges of the brillouin zone yields the conical energy spectrum . as a result , quasiparticles in graphene exhibit a linear dispersion relation .",
    "the formation of excitons requires the existence of the energy gap in electron and hole energy spectrum .",
    "the formation of excitons in gapped graphene was studied in refs .",
    "the electronic ground state of intrinsic graphene and bilayer graphene in the absence of the energy gap using density functional theory within the local - density approximation and bethe - salpeter equation was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , no pure bound exciton was identified in intrinsic graphene and bilayer graphene in the absence of the energy gap .",
    "therefore , excitons in graphene can be formed due to an energy gap opening in the electron and hole spectra in the graphene layer .",
    "there are different mechanisms of electronic excitations in graphene .",
    "the energy gap in graphene can be induced and controlled by a magnetic field , doping , an electric field in biased graphene , and hydrogenation @xcite .    by contrast",
    "quantum mechanics in the description of relativistic two - body problem the situation is extremely more complicated and till now there is no completely self - consistent theory for the separation of the center - of - mass and relative motions even for the two - body case . * *  * * this is due to the following facts :    \\i ) the particles locations and momenta are 4-vectors ,    \\ii ) the momenta are not independent but must satisfy mass - shell conditions ,    \\iii ) the inter - particle interaction potentials appear in the boosts as well as in the energy generator in the instant form of dynamics . as a result of a transformation to the center - of - mass system",
    "even a scalar action - at - a - distance inter - particle interaction potential becomes dependent on a coordinate and momentum .",
    "\\iv ) the structure of the poincare group implies that there is no definition of relativistic 4-center of mass sharing all the properties of the non - relativistic 3-center of mass @xcite .",
    "the two body problem in graphene when the electron and hole are interacted via a scalar action - at - a - distance inter - particle potential and are described by weyl s equation becomes even more complicated than in simple relativistic case .",
    "firstly , it is related to the fact that speed of light in the weyl equation for graphene is replaced by the the fermi speed and the resultant equation becomes non - covariant and canonical transformation implementing the separation of the center - of - mass from the relative variables within relativistic approach is invalided .",
    "secondly , even the inter - particle interaction depends only on the coordinate of the relative motion after to the center - of - mass transformation it becomes dependent also on a momentum .",
    "lastly , the center - of - mass energy can not be separated from the relative motion even though the interaction depends only on the coordinate of the relative motion .",
    "this is caused by the chiral nature of dirac electron in graphene .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ ham ] we present the hamiltonian of the spatially separated electron and hole in two different parallel graphene layers separated by a dielectric in the presence of the band gap . in sec .",

    "[ 2layers ] we obtain the energy spectrum and wave function of dipole exciton in two - layers graphene and find the effective exciton mass .",
    "the energy spectrum and wave function of exciton formed in a gapped graphene layer and corresponding effective exciton mass are given in sec .",
    "[ 1 layer ] . finally , the conclusions follow in sec .",
    "let us consider two different parallel graphene layers with the interlayer separation @xmath17 and assume that excitons in this system are formed by the electrons located in the one graphene layer and , correspondingly , the holes located in the other . in this system electrons and holes move in two separate layers with honeycomb lattice structure .",
    "since the motion of the electron is restricted in one graphene layer and the motion of the hole is restricted in the other graphene layer , we replace the coordinate vectors of the electron and hole by their projections @xmath18 and @xmath19 on plane of one of the graphene sheet .",
    "these new in - plane coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath8 will be used everywhere below .",
    "thus , we reduced the restricted 3d two - body problem to the 2d two - body problem on the graphene plane .",
    "each honeycomb lattice is characterized by the coordinates @xmath21 on sublattice a and @xmath22 on sublattice b with @xmath23 referring to the two sheets .",

    "the spinor components are from the same tight - binding wave function at different sites .",
    "each graphene layer has an energy gap .",
