    "a narrow constriction in for example a two dimensional electron gas makes a small cannel between two electron reservoirs .",
    "this constriction is called a quantum point contact@xcite .",
    "the width of the cannel can be controlled by a gate voltage and by applying a small bias the phenomenon of quantized conductance as a function of the width(i.e .",
    "gate voltage ) is observed at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this quantization is due to the wave nature of the electronic transport through the short ballistic point contact .",
    "experimentally@xcite , it is also possible to heat up one of the sides of the point contact and thereby producing a temperature difference @xmath4 across the contact , which in turn gives an electric current ( and a heat current ) though the point contact . by applying a bias @xmath5 in the opposite direction of the temperature difference @xmath4 the two contributions to the electric current @xmath6",
    "can be make to cancel , which defines the thermopower @xmath0 as @xmath7 for a quantum point contact , the thermopower as a function of gate voltage has a peak every time the conductance plateau changes from one subband of the transverse quantization to the next@xcite .    in order to compare experiment and theory for the thermopower of a point contact the so - called mott formula , @xmath8 , \\label{eq : cutler - mott - approx - vg}\\ ] ]",
    "is often a valuable toll , because by differentiating the experimentally found conductance @xmath9 with respect to the gate voltage @xmath10 one can see , if there is more information in the thermopower that in the conductance .",
    "this additional information could for example be many body effects@xcite , since @xmath11 is an approximation to the single - particle thermopower .",
    "note that this approximation is independent of the specific form of the transmission @xmath12 though the point contact .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper , to determine the validity of the mott approximation @xmath11 and thereby decide if it is really deviations from single - particle behavior the experiments@xcite observe or rather an artefact of this approximation .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we begin by deriving the single - particle thermopower formula in linear response to the applied bias @xmath5 and temperature difference @xmath4 . the current though a ballistic point contact is found from the landauer formula@xcite[p.111 , eq.(7.30 ) ] : @xmath13 , \\label{eq : landauer - formula}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the transmission and @xmath14 is the fermi function for the right / left ( @xmath15 ) lead .",

    "we insert the distribution functions in eq.([eq : landauer - formula ] ) and set it equal to zero and obtain : @xmath25}{\\int_0^{\\infty}\\!{\\textrm{d}}{\\varepsilon}\\mathcal{t}({\\varepsilon})[-{\\partial}_{{\\varepsilon}}f^0({\\varepsilon } ) ] } , \\label{eq : exact - thermopower - single - particle - picture}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is our exact single - particle formula .",
    "for @xmath26 we have @xmath27 , so the numerator in eq.([eq : exact - thermopower - single - particle - picture ] ) is zero , i.e.  @xmath28 . for temperatures",
    "@xmath29 much lower than the scale of variation of @xmath12 and @xmath30 , we can expand @xmath12 around @xmath18 to first order ( i.e.  a sommerfeld expansion ) to obtain : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the conductance for zero temperature , i.e.  @xmath33 .      the mott approximation @xcite is @xmath34 where @xmath3 is _ the temperature dependent _ conductance @xmath35 .",

    "the mott approximation to the single - particle thermopower eq.([eq : exact - thermopower - single - particle - picture ] ) and its range of validity is not so obvious compared to the approximation of the first order sommerfeld expansion eq.([eq : thermopower - first - order - in - kt ] ) .    one way of comparing @xmath0 from eq.([eq : exact - thermopower - single - particle - picture ] ) and",

    "\\label{eq : exact - thermopower - series}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that both formulas only have odd term in @xmath29 and the first order term is the same ( which is @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , none of the higher order terms are the same and on figure [ fig : integral - approx](right ) the different numerical factors of the two series expansions are seen to behave very differently as the power of @xmath29 grows : @xmath58    so the mott approximation is better the smaller the temperature compared to @xmath18 , but not a bad approximation for moderate temperatures ( i.e.  @xmath29 comparable to other energy scales ) as we shall see numerically . note that if the approximation eq.([eq : integral - for - low - temperatures ] ) is not valid , then we have all powers of @xmath29 .",
    "we need a specific model for the transmission to do a numerical comparison of @xmath0 from eq.([eq : exact - thermopower - single - particle - picture ] ) to @xmath59 and @xmath40 .",
    "using a harmonic potential in the point contact , i.e.  a saddle point potential , a transmission in the form of a fermi function can be derived@xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the smearing of the transmission between the steps and @xmath62 is the length of the steps ( often called subband spacing ) . in terms of the harmonic potential @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is along the cannel , we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 . other functional forms of @xmath67 have also been tested , but as along as they have the same graphical structure ( such as for example a @xmath68 dependence ) the same conclusions are obtained .",
    "three regimes of temperatures relevant to experiments are investigated numerically : @xmath69 the thermopower @xmath0 for the transmission model eq.([eq : transmission - buttiker ] ) is found from numerical integration of eq.([eq : exact - thermopower - single - particle - picture ] ) and compared to the mott approximation @xmath11 eq.([eq : cutler - mott - approx ] ) and the first order approximation @xmath40 eq.([eq : thermopower - first - order - in - kt ] ) . in all three regimes",
    ", we have a staircase conductance , so @xmath70 , and @xmath3 is also shown in the figures ( in arbitrary units ) for comparison .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 is of order @xmath62 , so the approximation @xmath72 used for example in eq.([eq : integral - for - low - temperatures ] ) is indeed very good .",
    "note that all energies in the figures are given in units of the step length @xmath62 .",
    "the information obtained from the numerical calculations is the following .",
    "figure  [ fig : thermopower](a - b ) shows that for @xmath29 being the lowest energy scale both approximations work very well as expected from the analytical considerations .",
    "when the temperature becomes comparable to the smearing of the steps , @xmath73 , the culter - mott formula works well and better than the first order approximation as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermopower](b - d ) . for @xmath29",
    "bigger than @xmath61 the mott approximation still works quit well whereas @xmath40 is not a good approximation anymore .",
    "the reason for the mott approximation to work well is found in the similar terms in the analytic temperature expansions eq.([eq : cutler - mott - series ] ) and ( [ eq : exact - thermopower - series ] ) .",
    "note that as @xmath29 increases both @xmath40 and @xmath11 show a tendency to overestimate @xmath0 at the peaks and underestimate it at the valleys .    in summary",
    ", we have found that the mott approximation to the single - particle thermopower is a fairly good approximation as along as the temperature is smaller than the fermi level , but @xmath29 can be both compatible and larger than the smearing of the transmission @xmath61 .",
    "however , to rule out any doubt one could use an experimental determination of @xmath12 from the ( very low temperature ) conductance to find the single - particle thermopower from eq.([eq : exact - thermopower - single - particle - picture ] ) , which could perhaps give an interesting comparison to the experimental result .",
    "thereby one would obtain an even more convincing statement of deviations from single - particle behavior in the thermopower .",
