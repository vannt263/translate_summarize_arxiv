    "in the classic tradition of condensed matter physics , the phenomenon of superconductivity is usually described as an instability of a normal metal towards a quantum state in which electrons bind into cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "this traditional picture , further fortified within the eliashberg formalism @xcite , has met with spectacular success when applied to conventional , low @xmath0-superconductors .",
    "this success is no accident : the bcs - eliashberg theory uses the landau theory of fermi liquids as the underlying description of a normal metal . in turn",
    ", the landau theory of fermi liquids is one of the most successful theories in physics  by starting from the free gas of fermions it exploits the constraint on the phase space imposed by the pauli exclusion principle to provide a comprehensive understanding of a low energy behavior of an _ interacting _ system . among its many pleasing features ,",
    "the landau theory allows for methodical understanding of the seeds of its own destruction  while fermi liquid is hardly the true ground state of any system , @xcite we routinely seek to understand such ground states by investigating various instabilities of the fermi liquid ( fl ) description , either in the particle - hole or particle - particle channel , few notable examples being spin- and charge - density waves , itinerant ferromagnetism and , of course , superconductivity .",
    "this remarkable success story of the bcs - eliashberg - fl theory gave birth to the traditional paradigm : `` one must understand the normal state before one can understand the superconductor '' @xcite .",
    "the discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductors ( hts ) and the subsequent efforts to decipher their mysteries altered the above state of affairs dramatically .",
    "as experimental information began to pour in , it became rapidly clear that hts depart qualitatively from the bcs - eliashberg - fl orthodoxy in at least three important ways .",
    "first , the high-@xmath0 superconducting copper oxides are strongly interacting systems in which correlations play an essential role .",
    "their parent compounds , believed to contain one hole per copper within cuo@xmath5 layers , are far from good metals that the simple band - structure theory would predict and are instead insulating neel antiferromagnets . even when doped and the long range antiferromagnetic order had subsided",
    ", these materials do not seem to follow the dictates of the fermi liquid theory , except perhaps in the heavily overdoped regime .",
    "rather , the `` normal '' metal state of the cuprates is anything but , and has been routinely dubbed `` anomalous '' or `` strange '' . in line with the traditional paradigm , a major theoretical effort , mainly inspired by anderson @xcite , has been directed at first understanding this anomalous `` normal '' state as arising from the hubbard - mott - neel antiferromagnetic insulator at half - filling once a small density of mobile dopant holes has been induced in the cuo@xmath5 layers . the physics of such `` doped mott insulator '' and particularly the microscopic mechanism through which the high temperature superconductivity itself is generated from within such a `` normal '' state , even after years of concentrated theoretical and experimental onslaught , remain a deep challenge to the condensed matter physics community .",
    "the second departure from the bcs - eliashberg - fl orthodoxy @xcite has by now been firmly established experimentally : the superconducting state in cuprates is itself of unconventional symmetry @xcite . instead of a usual `` s - wave '' gap function",
    "whose magnitude generally varies over the fermi surface but whose sign does not , the cuprates are `` d - wave '' superconductors .",
    "it is believed at the present time that this d - wave symmetry reflects the presence of correlations caused by strong on - site repulsion and is thus a close dynamical relative of the antiferromagnetic state at half - filling .",
    "majority of authors have focused on such purely electronic `` mechanism '' of superconductivity arising from strong correlations in sharp distinction to the phonon - mediated pairing of the traditional bcs - eliashberg approach .",
    "such unconventional symmetry of the superconducting state and the ensuing presence of low - energy fermionic excitations near the gap nodes result in a rich phenomenology of cuprates .",
    "most remarkably , however , this phenomenology , at low energies and temperatures and deep inside the superconducting state , seems to fit within the theoretical mold of a model bcs - like d - wave superconductor , quite separately from the detailed microscopic mechanism that is at its origin .",
    "we consider this an experimental fact of crucial significance which for the rest of this paper we intend to fully exploit to our advantage .",
    "finally , more than the intrinsic gap symmetry distinguishes hts from their conventional kin .",
    "they are also strongly fluctuating systems @xcite .",
    "while strong fluctuations away from a simple mean - field description are familiar occurrence in magnets or liquid crystals they are a relatively novel phenomenon in superconductors . in most conventional superconductors ,",
    "well - described by the bcs - eliashberg - fl theory , the fluctuations are simply not an issue : the dimensionless parameter which controls the deviations from the mean - field theory , the inverse of the product of the bcs coherence length @xmath6 and the fermi wavevector @xmath7 , is typically as small as @xmath8 or @xmath9 and the fluctuation effects are rarely observable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , early experiments on hts clearly established strong fluctuations in numerous physical quantities and various estimates put @xmath10 or larger .",
    "the strongly fluctuating nature of the superconducting state is particularly pronounced in underdoped cuprates and is rather vividly manifested in recent experiments on nernst effect by the princeton group @xcite .",
    "the nernst effect is routinely used to detect superconducting vortex fluctuations and a strong signal observed up to @xmath11 , with @xmath12 comparable to the pseudogap temperature @xmath13 , is most naturally interpreted in those terms .",
    "other experiments have also provided both direct @xcite and indirect @xcite support for the pairing fluctuations far above @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental evidence for such fluctuations has been compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , a different path toward the theory of hts was proposed in refs .",
    "a key aspect of this `` inverted '' approach is the observation that , when compared to its neighbors in the phase diagram of cuprates , the superconducting state appears to be the `` least correlated '' and its fermionic excitations best defined @xcite .",
    "a tantalizing theoretical feature of this approach is that it holds promise to turn the above triple predicament of strong correlations , fluctuations and unconventional symmetry in hts into an advantage by using the superconducting state as its departure point .",
    "the first step in constructing a theory based on this `` inverted '' philosophy is to assume that the most important effect of strong correlations at the basic microscopic level is to build a large pseudogap of d - wave symmetry , which is predominantly pairing in origin , i.e. arises form the particle - particle ( p - p ) channel . in this regard",
    ", we are following the wisdom of the fl theory but are replacing the free electron gas starting point with the free bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) d - wave quasiparticles . under the umbrella of this large d - wave pseudogap , the low energy fermionic excitations enjoy remarkably sheltered existence .",
    "they are completely impervious to weak residual short range interactions left over after the effect of the pseudogap had been built in .",
    "there is an important new element in this parallel with the fl .",
    "our reference state being a superconductor , we must also consider interactions of bdg quasiparticles with relevant collective modes of the pairing pseudogap , i.e. fluctuating thermal and quantum vortex - antivortex pairs . within the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite this interaction is represented by two u(1 ) gauge fields , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath14 describes doppler shift in quasiparticle energies @xcite and has been studied in refs .",
    "its effect on low energy fermions is rather modest since @xmath14 gains mass from fermions both in a superconductor and in a phase - incoherent pseudogap state .",
    "in contrast , the berry gauge field @xmath15 , minimally coupled to fermions and encoding the topological frustration inflicted upon bdg quasiparticles by fluctuating vortices , is massless in the pseudogap state and is the main source of strong scattering at low energies @xcite .",
    "the effective theory was found to take the form equivalent to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ( anisotropic ) quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath1 ) @xcite . in its symmetric phase",
    ", qed@xmath1 is governed by the interacting critical point leading to a non - fermi liquid behavior for its fermionic excitations .",
    "this `` algebraic '' fermi liquid ( afl ) @xcite displaces conventional fl as the underlying theory of the pseudogap state .",
    "the afl ( symmetric qed@xmath1 ) suffers an intrinsic instability when vortex - antivortex fluctuations and residual interactions become _ too strong_. the topological frustration is relieved by the spontaneous generation of mass for fermions , while the berry gauge field remains massless . in the field theory literature on qed@xmath1 this instability is known as the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) and is a well - studied and established phenomenon @xcite , although few clouds of uncertainty still hover over its more quantitative aspects @xcite . in cuprates , the region of such strong vortex fluctuations corresponds to heavily underdoped samples and the csb leads to spontaneous creation of a whole plethora of nearly degenerate ordered and gapped states from within the afl @xcite .",
    "an important check on the internal consistency of the `` inverted '' approach is that the manifold of csb states contains an incommensurate antiferromagnetic insulator ( spin - density wave ( sdw ) ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably , both the `` algebraic '' fermi liquid and the sdw and other csb insulating states arise from the one and the same qed@xmath1 theory @xcite , echoing the satisfying features of fermi liquid theory in conventional metals .",
    "it therefore appears that the `` inverted '' approach can be used to advance along the doping axis of the hts phase diagram ( fig .",
    "1 ) in the `` opposite '' direction , from a d - wave superconductor all the way to an antiferromagnetic insulator at very low doping , the low energy physics held under overall control of the symmetric qed@xmath1 ( afl ) .    in this paper",
    "we first present a detailed derivation of the qed@xmath1 theory of the pairing pseudogap state in underdoped cuprates previously introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and then embark on a systematic exploration of its fermionic excitation spectrum and other related properties . to keep the paper at manageable length we confine ourselves to the the chirally _ symmetric _ phase of qed@xmath1 , i.e. to the algebraic fermi liquid ( afl ) and its main properties . the chiral symmetry broken phase",
    "is discussed separately , in part ii of this paper .",
    "section ii and appendix a contain a step - by - step manual on vortex - quasiparticle interactions and how the low - energy physics of such interactions can be given its mathematical formulation in the language of the qed@xmath1 effective theory . in sections iii and iv",
    "we focus on the afl , give a detailed accounting of vortex - quasiparticle interactions within qed@xmath1 and compute quasiparticle spectral properties within the pseudogap symmetric phase . in section v we then discuss the effects of dirac anisotropy on the qed@xmath1 infrared fixed point and demonstrate that , to leading order in @xmath2-expansion , the anisotropic qed@xmath1 scales to an isotropic limit .",
    "finally , we present a brief summary of our results and conclusions in section vi .    in part ii of the paper , to appear separately , we introduce the concept of chiral symmetry within the d - wave pairing pseudogap state @xcite .",
    "we enumerate different physical states within the chiral manifold and discuss in depth various patterns of chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) ( fig . 1 ) and",
    "fermion mass generation within our qed@xmath1 theory .",
    "this is followed by the applications to the phase diagram of cuprates within the pseudogap state .",
    "our starting point is the assumption that the pseudogap is predominantly particle - particle or pairing ( p - p ) in origin and that it has a d@xmath16 symmetry .",

    "@xmath33 denotes the integral over smooth (  spin wave \" ) and singular ( vortex ) phase fluctuations .",
    "amplitude fluctuations of @xmath31 are suppressed at or just below @xmath13 and the amplitude itself is frozen at @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "the fermion fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ action0],[h1 ] ) do not necessarily refer to the bare electrons . rather , they represent some _ effective _ low - energy fermions of the theory , already fully renormalized by high - energy interactions , expected to be strong in cuprates due to mott - hubbard correlations near half - filling @xcite .",
    "the precise structure of such fermionic effective fields follows from a more microscopic theory and is not of our immediate concern here  we are only relying on the _ absence _ of _ true _ spin - charge separation which allows us to write the effective pairing term ( [ h1 ] ) in the bcs - like form . the experimental evidence that supports this reasoning , at least within the superconducting state and its immediate vicinity , is rather overwhelming @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath38 represents the `` residual '' interactions , i.e. the part dominated by the effective interactions in the p - h channel .",
    "our main assumption is equivalent to stating that such interactions are in a certain sense `` weak '' and less important part of the effective hamiltonian @xmath22 than the large pairing interactions already incorporated through @xmath31 . as we progress , this notion of `` weakness '' of @xmath38 will be defined more precisely and with it the region of validity of our theory .",
    "the above discussion reveals that our theory is at least partly of phenomenological character and it must rely on a more microscopic description to fully define its basic form specified by eqs .",
    "( [ action0],[h1 ] ) .",
    "while it is still far from established just what such more microscopic description might be in the case of cuprates , various gauge theories of the @xmath39 and related models @xcite , could all be used for this purpose at the present time . the main role played by such theories",
    "is providing reliable values of parameters that feed into the basic formulation ( [ action0],[h1 ] ) .",
    "these include , most importantly , the pairing pseudogap @xmath40 itself , the microscopic values of vortex core energies , the strengths of residual interactions , etc .",
    "once these parameters have been supplied through such an external input it is our task to solve for the low energy ( @xmath41 ) , long distance physics of ( [ action0],[h1 ] ) . at present",
    ", these needed parameters can not be computed reliably from a fully microscopic approach .",
    "we therefore combine the available theoretical arguments with the experimentally determined phase diagram ( fig . 1 ) and argue that the pseudogap is indeed pairing in origin and that the transition from the superconductor to the pseudogap state must proceed via thermal and quantum unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs .     a schematic representation of the phase diagram of a cuprate superconductor . below @xmath13 ( @xmath42 ) ,",

    ", width=302 ]    our `` inverted '' approach is similar in spirit to the landau theory of fermi liquids as applied to conventional metals . in fermi liquid ( fl ) theory",
    "the reference state is that of a non - interacting gas of fermions .",
    "as the interactions are turned on adiabatically , the pauli principle severely restricts the available phase space for scattering and many of the general features of free fermion system are preserved , albeit in a renormalized form @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the reference state is a non - interacting system of bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) fermions .",
    "one can think of the pairing pseudogap @xmath40 as being our `` fermi energy '' and the highest energy scale in the problem . while our theory can not account for the physics at energies ( or temperatures ) higher than @xmath40 , we will endevour to show that the low energy physics can be computed systematically and is parametrized by a handful of material constants whose values can be extracted either from experiments or from a more microscopic theory .    in this context , the residual interactions among the bdg fermions , both those arising from the p - p channel through weak amplitude fluctuations of @xmath40 and the p - h interactions generated by the effective spin fluctuations within the pseudogap state @xcite , can be thought of as our version of `` landau interaction parameters '' @xmath43 .",
    "these interactions are generically short - ranged and are even less effective in disturbing the coherence of nodal bdg fermions than their fl counterpart . with all of the fermi surface",
    "gapped apart from the nodal regions , such interactions are irrelevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense and can be absorbed into renormalizations of various relevant parameters ( more on this in section iii ) . as the system makes the transition from a phase - coherent superconductor to a phase - incoherent pseudogap state , the nodal bdg fermions interacting only through such residual interactions would hardly notice  the nodal bdg liquid is a better fermi liquid than the original .",
    "there is , however , another source of interactions among bdg quasiparticles which ruins this happy state of affairs .",
    "our reference state being a superconductor , we must consider the interactions of bdg fermions with collective modes of @xmath40 relevant near the superconductor-``normal '' boundary , i.e. fluctuating vortices . as we demonstrate next , these interactions between bdg quasiparticles and fluctuating vortex - antivortex excitations play the central dynamical role in our theory .      the global u(1 )",
    "gauge invariance mandates that the partition function ( [ action0 ] ) must be independent of the overall choice of phase for @xmath27 .",
    "we should therefore aim to eliminate the phase @xmath44 from the pairing term ( [ h1 ] ) in favor of @xmath45 terms [ @xmath46 in the fermionic action .",
    "for the regular ( `` spin - wave '' ) piece of @xmath47 this is easily accomplished by absorbing a phase factor @xmath48 into both spin - up and spin - down fermionic fields .",
    "this amounts to `` screening '' the phase of @xmath49 ( or an `` xy phase '' , as commonly known ) by a `` half - phase '' field ( or `` half - xy phase '' ) attached to @xmath36 and @xmath37 . however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , when dealing with the singular part of @xmath47 , such transformation `` screens '' physical singly quantized @xmath50 superconducting vortices with `` half - vortices '' in the fermionic fields .",
    "consequently , this `` half - angle '' gauge transformation must be accompanied by branch cuts in the fermionic fields which originate and terminate at vortex positions and across which the quasiparticle wavefunction must switch its sign .",
    "these branch cuts are mathematical manifestation of a fundamental physical effect : in presence of vortices , which are topological defects in the phase of the cooper pair field and thus naturally bind the elementary flux of @xmath50 , the motion of quasiparticles is _ topologically frustrated _ , since their natural elementary flux is twice as large ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the physics of this topological frustration is at the origin of all non - trivial dynamics discussed in this paper .",
    "dealing with branch cuts in a fluctuating vortex problem is a rather cumbersome affair due to their non - local character and defeats the original purpose of reducing the problem to that of fermions interacting with _",
    "local _ fluctuating superflow field , i.e. with @xmath45 . instead",
    ", in order to avoid the branch cuts , non - locality and non - single valued wavefunctions , we employ the singular gauge transformation devised in ref .",
    "@xcite , hereafter referred to as ` ft ' transformation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "here @xmath54 is the singular part of the phase due to @xmath55 vortex defects : @xmath56 with @xmath57 denoting the topological charge of @xmath58-th vortex and @xmath59 its position .",
    "the labels @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent some convenient but otherwise arbitrary division of vortex defects ( loops or lines in @xmath44 ) into two sets , although we will soon discuss many virtues of the _ symmetrized _ transformation ( [ ft ] ) which apportions vortex defects _ equally _ between sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the transformation ( [ ft ] ) `` screens '' the original superconducting phase @xmath47 ( or `` xy phase '' ) with two ordinary `` xy phases '' @xmath62 and @xmath63 attached to fermions . both @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "are themselves perfectly legitimate phase configurations of @xmath49 but simply with fewer vortex defects .",
    "the key feature of the transformation ( [ ft ] ) is that it accomplishes `` screening '' of the physical @xmath50 vortices by using only `` whole '' ( i.e. , not `` halved '' ) vortices in fermionic fields and thus guarantees that the quasiparticle wavefunctions remain single - valued .",
    "the topological frustration still remains , being the genuine physical effect of the branch cuts , but is now incorporated directly into the fermionic part of the action : @xmath64\\psi_{\\uparrow } + \\bar\\psi_{\\downarrow}[\\partial_{\\tau } + i(\\partial_{\\tau}\\varphi_b)]\\psi_{\\downarrow } + \\psi^{\\dag}{\\cal h}^{\\prime}\\psi , \\label{vmuamu}\\ ] ] where the transformed hamiltonian @xmath65 is : @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the singular gauge transformation ( [ ft ] ) generates a `` berry '' gauge potential @xmath69 which describes half - flux aharonov - bohm scattering of quasiparticles on vortices .",
    "@xmath15 couples to bdg fermions _ minimally _ and mimics the effect of branch cuts in quasiparticle - vortex dynamics @xcite .",
    "closed fermion loops in the feynman path - integral representation of ( [ action0 ] ) acquire the ( @xmath70 ) phase factors due to this half - flux aharonov - bohm effect just as they would from a branch cut attached to a vortex defect .",
    "the topological frustration is now implemented through the fact that @xmath71 , minimally coupled to a loop of bdg fermions in the partition function ( [ action0 ] ) as it winds around the imaginary time direction , generates the phase equal to the advance in the xy phase @xmath72 , which inhabits the same spacetime , along the closed path coinciding with the said fermion loop .",
    "naturally , this advance must be an integer multiple of @xmath73  the overall factor of @xmath74 in the definition of @xmath15 ( [ berry ] ) reduces this further to an integer multiple of @xmath75 .",
    "in the end , the phase factors of such fermion loops , which are the gauge invariant quantities , are all equal to @xmath76 and are furthermore precisely what we would have obtained had we opted for the `` half - angle '' gauge transformation and implemented the branch cuts .",
    "the above @xmath77 prefactors of the bdg fermion loops come on top of general and everpresent u(1 ) phase factors @xmath78 , where the phase @xmath79 depends on spacetime configuration of vortices .",
    "these u(1 ) phase factors are supplied by the  doppler \" gauge field @xmath80 which denotes the classical part of the quasiparticle - vortex interaction . the coupling of @xmath14 to fermions is the same as that of the usual electromagnetic gauge field @xmath81 and is therefore _ non - minimal _ , due to the pairing term in the original hamiltonian @xmath82 ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "it is this non - minimal interaction with @xmath14 , which we call the meissner coupling , that is responsible for the u(1 ) phase factors @xmath78 .",
    "these u(1 ) phase factors are `` random '' , in the sense that they are not topological in nature  their values depend on detailed distribution of superfluid fields of all vortices and `` spin - waves '' as well as on the internal structure of bdg fermion loops , i.e. what is the sequence of spin - up and spin - down portions along such loops . in this respect , while its minimal coupling to bdg fermions means that , within the lattice d - wave superconductor model @xcite , one is naturally tempted to represent the berry gauge field @xmath15 as a _",
    "u(1 ) gauge field , the doppler gauge field @xmath14 is decidedly _ non - compact _ , lattice or no lattice @xcite . the reader should be advised , however , that the issue of `` compactness '' of @xmath15 versus `` non - compactness '' of @xmath14 constitutes a moot point : @xmath15 and @xmath14 as defined by eqs .",
    "( [ berry],[doppler ] ) are _ not independent _ since the discrete spacetime configurations of vortex defects @xmath83 serve as _ sources _ for _ both_. we will belabor this important issue in the next subsection .    for now , note that all choices of the sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 in transformation ( [ ft ] ) are completely _ equivalent _  different choices represent different singular gauges and @xmath14 , and therefore @xmath78 , are invariant under such transformations .",
    "@xmath15 , on the other hand , changes but only through the introduction of ( @xmath84 ) unit aharonov - bohm fluxes at locations of those vortex defects involved in the transformation .",
    "consequently , the z@xmath5 style @xmath77 phase factors associated with @xmath15 that multiply the fermion loops remain unchanged .",
    "we now symmetrize the partition function with respect to this singular gauge by defining a generalized transformation ( [ ft ] ) as the sum over all possible choices of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , i.e. , over the entire family of singular gauge transformations .",
    "this is an ising sum with @xmath85 members , where @xmath86 is the total number of vortex defects in @xmath44 , and is itself yet another choice of the singular gauge .",
    "the many benefits of such symmetrized gauge will be discussed shortly but we stress here that its ultimate function is calculational convenience .",
    "what actually matters for the physics is that the original @xmath47 be split into two xy phases so that the vortex defects of every distinct topological class are apportioned _ equally _ between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( [ ft ] ) @xcite .",
    "the physics behind this last requirement can be intuitively appreciated as follows : imagine that we simply _ prohibit _ singly quantized vortex excitations and replace them in ( [ vmuamu ] ) by _ doubly quantized _",
    "@xmath87 vortices . in this case",
    ", the berry gauge field attaches a multiple of a _ full _ aharonov - bohm flux to each vortex position and all the phase factors in front of fermion loops equal unity  this is equivalent to @xmath88 and complete absence of topological frustration .",
    "_ it is then natural to select the gauge which eliminates @xmath15 altogether_. this is straightforwardly accomplished by screening each doubly quantized @xmath87 vortex defect with a unit - flux dirac string in @xmath89 and an equivalent one in @xmath90 .",
    "the resulting sets of @xmath60 and @xmath61 vortices are two identical replicas of each other and @xmath91 . now ,",
    "while still staying within the same gauge , we allow doubly quantized vortices to relax into energetically more favorable configurations  they will immediately decay into singly quantized vortices and our sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 will end up containing an equal number of singly quantized vortices of each distinct topological class .",
    "for example , in the case of 2d thermal fluctuations @xmath54 should each contain a half of the original vortices in @xmath47 and a half of antivortices .",
    "this is readily achieved by including those ( anti)vortex variables whose positions are labeled by @xmath92 with @xmath58 _ even _ into @xmath62 , while the _ odd _ ones are absorbed into @xmath63 .",

    "we start by noting that @xmath106 is just the physical superfluid velocity @xcite , invariant under both @xmath107 singular gauge transformations ( [ ft ] ) and ordinary electromagnetic u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the superfluid velocity ( doppler ) field , swirling around each ( anti)vortex defect , is responsible for a vast majority of phenomena that we associate with vortices : long range interactions between vortex defects , coupling to external magnetic field and the abrikosov lattice of the mixed state , kosterlitz - thouless transition , etc .",
    "remarkably , we will show that its role is essential even for the physics discussed in the present paper , although it now appears as a supporting actor to the berry gauge field @xmath15 which ultimately occupies the center stage . to see how this comes about ,",

    "we can now write @xmath114 and reexpress the transverse portion of ( [ meissner ] ) in terms of ( anti)vortex positions @xmath115 to obtain a familiar form : @xmath116 or , by using @xmath117 and @xmath118 , equivalently as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the vortex density .",
    "the meissner coupling of @xmath121 to fermions is very strong  it leads to familiar long range interactions between vortices which constrain vortex fluctuations to a remarkable degree . to make this statement mathematically explicit we introduce the fourier transform of vortex density @xmath122 and",

    "the latter is our _ coarse grained _ doppler gauge field defined by @xmath129 we have now gone full circle with the doppler gauge field @xmath121 .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure has made it into a massive u(1 ) gauge field @xmath128 whose influence on tf disappears in the long wavelength limit .",
    "we can therefore drop it from low energy fermiology .",
    "hereafter we shall drop the bar and use symbol @xmath121 for both the actual and the coarse grained quantity , the meaning being obvious from the context .",
    "the real problem also contains the berry gauge field @xmath108 which now must be restored .",
    "however , if we are to take advantage of introducing continuous @xmath130 and eventually dispensing with @xmath121 , @xmath108 can not remain the same gauge field we started with in eq .",

    "the recipe for such a required `` dressing '' of the berry gauge field is straightforward in the ft singular gauge ",
    "it takes the form of a non - compact u(1 ) gauge field with a simple maxwellian action . to see how this comes about note that if we insist on replacing @xmath121 by its `` coarse - grained '' form ( [ meissner3 ] ) , the only way to achieve this is to `` coarse - grain '' _ both _ @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the same manner : @xmath134 where @xmath135 are now continuously distributed densities of @xmath55 vortex defects ( the reader should contrast this with ( [ berry],[doppler ] ) ) .",

    "this is an unacceptable feature for the effective theory and seriously handicaps the general `` @xmath161 '' gauge , in which the original phase is split into @xmath162 , with @xmath54 each containing some _ arbitrary _ fraction of the original vortex defects .",

    "this argument is actually quite rigorous in the case of quantum fluctuations where the symmetrized gauge ( [ ft ] ) represents a fixed point in the rg analysis ( see below ) @xcite .",

    "the above discussion provides the rationale behind using the ft transformation in our quest for the effective theory . at low energies ,",
    "the interactions between quasiparticles and vortices are represented by two u(1 ) gauge fields @xmath148 and @xmath165 ( [ va],[va3 ] ) .",

    "having elucidated the origin of the `` coarse - grained '' u(1 ) gauge fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 and settled on the symmetrized ft transformation ( [ ft ] ) as the natural gauge choice for this problem , there remains one more task to be accomplished before we can conclude this section . we need to derive a precise expression for the long distance , low energy form of the `` jacobian '' @xmath170 $ ] which serves as the `` bare action '' for the gauge fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 of our effective theory .",
    "as shown below , this form is a non - compact maxwellian whose stiffness @xmath171 ( or inverse `` charge '' @xmath172 ) stands in intimate relation to the helicity modulus tensor of a dsc and , in the pseudogap regime of strong superconducting fluctuations , can be expressed in terms of a _",

    "this is no accident  the straightforward relationship between the massless ( or massive ) character of @xmath170 $ ] and the superconducting phase disorder ( or order ) is a consequence of rather general physical and symmetry principles .    to make good on the above claim consider first a simple example of an s - wave superconductor with a large gap @xmath40 extending over all of the fermi surface .",
    "we can also view this as a model for the high energy bdg quasiparticles in dsc , those far removed from the nodes .",

    "we can now reap the benefits of this convenient separation . in the language of bdg fermions the system ( [ bareactions ] ) is a large gap `` semiconductor '' and the berry gauge field couples to it minimally through `` bdg '' vector and scalar potentials @xmath136 and @xmath182 . such bdg semiconductor is a poor dielectric diamagnet with respect to @xmath15 . we proceed to ignore its `` diamagnetic susceptibility '' and also set @xmath183 to concentrate on thermal fluctuations .",
    "all this means is that the berry gauge field part of the coupling between quasiparticles and vortices in a large gap s - wave superconductor influences the latter only through weak short - range interactions which are unimportant in the region of strong vortex fluctuations near kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "we can therefore drop @xmath136 from the fermionic part of the action and integrate over it to obtain @xmath96 in terms of physical vorticity @xmath184 .",

    "accordingly , the non - superconducting ground state in the pseudogap regime will likely contain a weak charge modulation  the modulation is made weak by the same strong fluctuations that make @xmath237 .",

    "operationally , the problem with computation of @xmath387 ( [ e5 ] ) is not in the algebra but resides in the physical interpretation of the obtained results . in the axial gauge regularization followed by the momentum space computation employed by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , the negative value for @xmath403 arises from the treatment of spurious gauge singularities that are invariably introduced by writing the gauge boson propagator in the axial gauge @xcite .",
    "these singularities then must be regularized in some way and this is done using an ad hoc principal value prescription for momentum space integrals .",
    "the problem with this prescription is that the momentum space propagator in the axial gauge _ does not exist _",
    "axial gauge is an example of a singularly non - covariant gauge ( like coulomb , temporal or similar gauges ) and as such does not fully fix the gauge .",
    "the gauge transformations which are independent of the spacetime variable @xmath420 singled out by the axial gauge but have arbitrary dependence on the remaining @xmath421 variables @xmath422 are still allowed and cost no energy .",
    "consequently , the gauge - variant two - point fermion propagator @xmath423 must vanish whenever @xmath424 , @xmath425 , @xmath426 @xcite . the same problem resurfaces in a different form when one computes ( [ e5 ] ) directly in the covariant gauge @xcite : the expectation value of the transverse part ( @xmath346 ) of the line integral , @xmath427 , decouples from the rest of the expression .",
    "in fact , the result @xmath418 is easily understood as arising from the tf propagator in the lorentz gauge @xmath428 ( @xmath429 ) being made more coherent through simply being multiplied by the said expectation value of the transverse part of line integral ( @xmath430 where @xmath431 from the above computation of @xmath190 , with @xmath346 ) .",
    "since @xmath432 is an expectation value of a phase factor , this is clearly a troubling result  such a multiplicative factor can make the full propagator only less coherent than @xmath428 as @xmath433 .",
    "the problem is that the transverse part of the line integral is more divergent than just a simple @xmath434 appearing in the exponent .",
    "when the dominant ( linear ) divergence is included , the full propagator @xmath387 is exponentially suppressed ( @xmath435 ) and can not be computed without some physically motivated uv regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "we have also carried out our own calculation in the axial gauge using a different regularization scheme and obtained different ( negative ) exponent @xmath436 .",

    "the optimally doped to @xmath446 in the heavily underdoped samples .",
    "there are two key issues : first , for a large enough number of dirac fermion species @xmath4 , how is the chirally symmetric infrared ( ir ) fixed point modified by the fact that @xmath447 , and second , as we decrease @xmath4 , does the chiral symmetry breaking occur at the same value of @xmath4 as in the isotropic theory . in this section",
    "we address in detail the first issue and defer the discussion of the second one to part ii .",
    "we determine the effect of the dirac anisotropy , marginal by power counting , by the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) to first order in the large @xmath4 expansion . to the leading order @xmath79 in the small anisotropy @xmath448",

    "these results hold even when anisotropy is not small as shown by numerical evaluation of the @xmath453-function .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the isotropic fixed point is stable against small anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , we show that in any covariant gauge renormalization of @xmath454 due to the unphysical longitudinal degrees of freedom is _ exactly _ the same along any space - time direction .",
    "therefore the only contribution to the rg flow of anisotropy comes from the physical degrees of freedom and our results for @xmath449 stated above are in fact gauge invariant .      in the realm of condensed matter physics",
    "there is no lorentz symmetry to safeguard the space - time isotropy of the theory .",
    "rather , the intrinsic dirac anisotropy is always present since it ultimately arises from complicated microscopic interactions in the solid which eventually renormalize to band and pairing amplitude dispersion .",
    "thus there is nothing to protect the difference in the fermi velocity @xmath455 and the gap velocity @xmath456 from vanishing and , in fact , all hts materials are anisotropic .",
    "the value of @xmath450 can be directly measured by the angle resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , which is ultimately a `` high '' energy local probe of @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",

    "the pairing amplitude of the hts cuprates has @xmath457 symmetry , and consequently there are four nodal points on the fermi surface with dirac dispersion around which we can linearize the theory .",

    "as before , we combine the four two - component dirac spinors for the opposite ( time reversed ) nodes into two four - components spinors and label them as @xmath459 and @xmath287 ( see fig . [ fsfig ] ) .",

    "we assume that both @xmath298 and @xmath299 are dimensionless and that eventually one of them can be chosen to be unity by an appropriate choice of the `` speed of light '' .",
    "since @xmath447 breaks lorentz invariance of the theory and since it is the lorentz invariance that protects the spacetime isotropy , we expect the @xmath453 functions for @xmath450 to acquire finite values . however , the theory still respects time - reversal and parity and for @xmath4 large enough the system is in the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "these symmetries force the fermion self - energy of the interacting theory to have the form @xmath468 where @xmath469 and @xmath470 .",

    "furthermore , there is a discrete symmetry which relates flavors @xmath472 and @xmath473 and the @xmath227 and @xmath458 directions in such a way that @xmath474 in the computation of the fermion self - energy , this discrete symmetry allows us to concentrate on a particular pair of nodes without any loss of generality .",
    "as discussed above in the isotropic case , the effect of vortex - antivortex fluctuations at t=0 on the fermions can , at large distances , be included by coupling the nodal fermions minimally to a fluctuating @xmath475 gauge field with a standard maxwell action . upon integrating out the fermions",
    ", the gauge field acquires a stiffness proportional to @xmath476 , which is another way of saying that at the charged , chirally symmetric fixed point the gauge field has an anomalous dimension @xmath477 ( for discussion of this point in the bosonic qed see @xcite ) .",
    "we first proceed in the transverse gauge ( @xmath478 ) which is in some sense the most physical one considering that the @xmath479 is physically related to the vorticity , i.e. an intrinsically transverse quantity .",

    "the direct inversion of the @xmath488 matrix would obscure the analysis and therefore , we choose to follow a more physical and notationally transparent line of reasoning which eventually leads to the correct expression for the gauge field propagator . upon integrating out the fermions and expanding the effective action to the one - loop order",

    "the expression ( [ lb ] ) is manifestly gauge invariant and has the merit of not only being quadratic but also diagonal in the individual components of @xmath491 .",

    "it is now quite simple to determine the correlation function for the @xmath281 field and in the transverse gauge we obtain @xmath501 using the transverse character of @xmath502 ( which is independent of the gauge ) the above expression can be further reduced to @xmath503 it can be easily checked that in the isotropic limit the expression ( [ bp ] ) properly reduces to the results obtained in a different way .",
    "we can further extend this result to include a general gauge by writing @xmath504 where @xmath350 is our continuous parameterization of the gauge fixing .",
    "this expression can be justified by the fadeev - popov type of procedure starting from the lagrangian @xmath505 where the stiffness for the unphysical modes was judiciously chosen to scale as @xmath476 in a particular combination of the physical scalars of the theory .",

    "is our final result for the gauge field propagator in a covariant gauge .      as discussed in sec .",
    "iv , @xmath454 is not gauge invariant in that it has an explicit dependence on the gauge fixing parameter . as we will show in this section ( and more generally in the appendix d ) , the renormalization of @xmath454 by the unphysical longitudinal degrees of freedom does not depend on the space - time direction : the term in @xmath454 which is proportional to @xmath508 is renormalized the same way by the gauge dependent part of the action as the terms proportional to @xmath509 and @xmath510 . therefore , the only contribution to the rg flow of @xmath450 comes from the physical degrees of freedom .",

    "in fact , such a theory would have a _ critical line _ of @xmath450 .",
    "for this to happen , however , there would have to be a symmetry which would protect the equality @xmath528 .",
    "for example , in the isotropic qed@xmath1 the symmetry which protects the equality of @xmath358 s is the lorentz invariance . in the case at hand , this symmetry is broken and therefore we expect that @xmath529 will be different from @xmath530 , suggesting that the anisotropy flows away from its bare value . if we start with @xmath531 and find that @xmath532 at some scale @xmath533 , we would conclude that the anisotropy is marginally irrelevant and decreases towards @xmath534 .",
    "on the other hand if @xmath535 , then anisotropy continues increasing beyond its bare value and the theory flows into a _ critical point _ with ( in)finite anisotropy .",
    "the issue is further complicated by the fact that @xmath536 is not a gauge invariant quantity , i.e. it depends on the gauge fixing parameter @xmath350 .",
    "the statement that , say @xmath537 , makes sense only if the @xmath350 dependence of @xmath538 and @xmath539 is exactly the same , otherwise we could choose a gauge in which the difference @xmath540 can have either sign .",
    "however , we see from the equations ( [ eta0]-[eta2 ] ) that in fact the @xmath350 dependence of all @xmath358 s is indeed the same . although it was explicitly demonstrated only to the @xmath541 , in the appendix d we show that it is in fact true to all orders of anisotropy for any choice of covariant gauge fixing .",
    "this fact provides the justification for our procedure .",
    "now we supply the formal analysis reflecting the above discussion .",

    "the labels `` compact '' and `` non - compact '' gauge fields pasted on @xmath15 and @xmath14 have the following precise meaning : let us for a moment forget about definitions ( [ berry],[doppler ] ) and simply treat @xmath15 and @xmath14 appearing in ( [ vmuamu ] ) as two completely _ independent _ gauge fields .",
    "we further introduce the _ compactified _ gauge transformations ( for example , see i. i. kogan and a. kovner , , 4510 ( 1996 ) ; _ ibid _ * 51 * , 1948 ( 1995 ) ) defined as : @xmath763 where @xmath764 describes the ordinary smooth or regular gauge transformations .",
    "these familiar gauge transformations are extended to include singular gauge transformations described by @xmath765 , itself determined from : @xmath766 where the sum runs over an arbitrary number @xmath767 of unit - flux dirac strings and @xmath768 denotes a line integral .",
    "we now inquire whether the theory ( [ vmuamu ] ) is invariant under such compactified gauge transformations when applied to @xmath15 .",
    "the answer is `` yes '' .",
    "however , when the same type of transformation is separately applied to @xmath14 , the answer is `` no '' , due to its meissner coupling to bdg fermions . hence the labels .",
    "note that both @xmath103 and @xmath104 are non - compact in the same sense .",
    "for computational convenience we define @xmath769 as twice the conventional superfluid density ; see ref .",
    "an exception to this general situation is the anderson gauge , @xmath770 , @xmath771 or @xmath772 , @xmath773 ( p. w. anderson , cond - mat/9812063 ) , which has least desirable properties in this regard , resulting in @xmath774 ( @xmath775 ) , or an _ infinitely _ strong coupling between @xmath121 and @xmath136 .",
    "it is then impossible to decouple @xmath121 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath136 ( @xmath15 ) , even in the rg sense .",
    "consequently , any attempt to construct the effective theory by using the anderson gauge is unlikely to be successful . to illustrate this , note that in the anderson gauge ( also in a general `` @xmath161 '' gauge ) the system has _",
    "finite _ overall magnetization : @xmath776 !",
    "in contrast , in the ft gauge ( [ ft],[jacobian ] ) @xmath777 as it must be . again",

    "this situation is reminiscent of the landau gauge ( @xmath778 ) being the fixed point among all covariant gauges of the higgs - abelian theory . at the risk of boring the reader",
    ", we reiterate that all the different singular gauges lead to precisely the same results if the partition function is evaluated _ exactly _ , by integrating over the _ discrete _ vortex variables @xmath83  it is only when we seek to perform this integration approximately , in terms of _ distributed _ quantities like @xmath779 or @xmath780 , that the trouble arises .",

    "<S> high-@xmath0 cuprates differ from conventional superconductors in three crucial aspects : the superconducting state descends from a strongly correlated mott - hubbard insulator ( as opposed to a fermi liquid ) , the order parameter exhibits d - wave symmetry and fluctuations play an all important role . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate an effective theory of underdoped cuprates within the pseudogap state by taking the advantage of these unusual features . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we introduce a concept of  pairing protectorate \" and we seek to describe various phases within this protectorate by phase disordering a d - wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the elementary excitations of the protectorate are the bogoliubov - de gennes quasiparticles and topological defects in the phase of the pairing field  vortices and antivortices  which appear as quantum and thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the effective low energy theory of these elementary excitations is shown to be , apart from intrinsic anisotropy , equivalent to the quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1 ) space - time dimensions ( qed@xmath1 ) . a detailed derivation of this qed@xmath1 theory is given and some of its main physical consequences are inferred for the pseudogap state . </S>",
    "<S> as the superconducting order is destroyed by underdoping two possible outcomes emerge : ( i ) the system can go into a symmetric normal state characterized as an  algebraic fermi liquid \" ( afl ) before developing antiferromagnetic ( af ) order , or ( ii ) a direct transition into the af state can occur . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the af order arises spontaneously , through an intrinsic  chiral \" instability of qed@xmath1/afl . here </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the properties of afl and propose that inside the pairing protectorate it assumes the role reminiscent of that played by the fermi liquid theory in conventional metals . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a gauge invariant electron propagator of afl and show that within the @xmath2 expansion it has a non - fermi liquid , luttinger - like form with positive anomalous dimension @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the number of pairs of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effects of dirac anisotropy by the perturbative renormalization group analysis and find that the theory flows into isotropic fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that , at long lengthscales , the afl is stable against anisotropy . </S>"
