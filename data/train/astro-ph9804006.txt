    "one of the fundamental components of most theories of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) is an accretion disk .",
    "as gas is fed into the central regions of the qso , residual angular momentum causes the gas to naturally settle into a disk .",
    "while most theories predict the formation of such a disk , few address the observational consequences of the disk models in detail .",
    "these theoretical studies have found that the lyman edge at 912  is a powerful diagnostic feature for the physical characteristics of the disk .",
    "the simplest disk models ( quasi - static with viscous dissipation at large optical depth ) predict lyman edges in either emission or absorption , depending on the viewing angle and the physical details of the disk atmosphere .",
    "such lyman edges would be broadened by rotation of the disk and by general relativistic effects as light passes close to the central black hole . in most qsos",
    "such edges are not seen , although koratkar , kinney , & bohlin ( 1992 ) found a small number of candidate `` partial edges '' in iue data .",
    "a second disk signature is the linear polarization , @xmath1 , of the continuum from the disk .",
    "a purely scattering atmosphere will produce high polarization perpendicular to the disk axis .",
    "again , this signature is not seen in any qsos ; in fact generally qsos show _ low _ optical polarization _",
    "parallel _ to the inferred disk axis .",
    "laor , netzer , & piran ( 1990 ) attempted to show that a disk atmosphere should have significant absorptive opacity , and thus can produce dramatically lower optical polarization ( albeit still perpendicular to the disk axis and thus inconsistent with the observations ) .",
    "a more robust prediction according to their work , however , is a rise in polarization with decreasing wavelength from the optical into the uv .",
    "just longward of the lyman edge @xmath1 is highest , since it is at these wavelengths that scattering best competes with absorption .",
    "just shortward of the lyman edge , as the absorption opacity increases , @xmath1 should drop again . according to laor",
    ", this polarization signature should appear even when no disk signature is seen in total flux .",
    "in our first polarization study of three of the rare objects known from iue spectra to have partial lyman edges at the systemic redshifts , we found low polarizations longward of the edges , so we did not confirm the laor prediction .",
    "we surprisingly did find high polarization _",
    "shortward _ of the edge in a couple of objects , contrary to the accretion disk predictions of laor , but qualitatively explicable by effects found in the more detailed calculations of blaes & agol ( 1996 ) ; see also agol & blaes ( 1996 ) .",
    "the previous studies of intermediate redshift quasars ( koratkar 1995 and impey 1995 ) , included 4 objects , one of which shows only a marginal detection of polarization , while the remaining three objects show significant polarization ( @xmath2 a few percent ) shortward of the lyman edge .",
    "a study of three high redshift objects observed from the ground failed to show any polarization changes at the edge position ; most had tight limits on the polarization longward of the edge , but noisy data shortward of the lyman edge ( antonucci 1996 ) .",
    "pg 1630 + 377 is the only object yet observed that can be studied in any detail ( koratkar 1995 ; paper i ) . in this object",
    "@xmath1 rises rapidly shortward of the edge , reaching 20% by 1600  ( 650  rest wavelength ) .",
    "the ly@xmath3 emission line also shows a high ( 7.3% ) polarization at the same position angle .",
    "antonucci ( 1996 ) discuss polarization observations and other constraints on disk models in some detail .",
    "based on the small number of qsos observed in the uv in polarization , at the time of paper i , we could say little about whether high polarization shortward of the lyman edge is common .",
    "hence , we have significantly expanded the uv polarization database by observing six bright , @xmath4 qsos both below and above the lyman edge . in this paper",
    "we discuss these new spectropolarimetric ultraviolet observations from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "faint object spectrograph ( _ hst / fos _ ) . a difference with respect to our previous study , however , is that only two of the new objects were suspected to have partial edges in total flux at the systemic redshift .",
    "the rest were simply selected because they show significant flux at short wavelengths .",
    "in their iue archival search , koratkar , kinney & bohlin ( 1992 ) identified six qsos with partial lyman edges consistent with edges from simple thin accretion disks .",
    "the possible observational detection of accretion disk edges in these low red - shift quasars indicates that we are more likely to see the accretion disk , and thus detect the polarization changes , as predicted by theory .",
    "also since these objects are low redshift agns we expect the uv continuum shortward of ly@xmath3 to be less affected by intervening absorption ( the ly@xmath3 forest ) .",
    "three objects of the iue sample ( pks 0405 - 123 , pg 1338 + 416 , and pg 1630 + 377 ) have already been discussed in koratkar ( 1995 ) .",
    "our present sample includes two more objects ( pg 0117 + 213 and pg 0743 - 673 ) from the iue sample ( see section 3 for the new evaluation of these targets as possible partial lyman edge candidates ) .",
    "the post - costar fos polarimetry capability does not extend to @xmath51600  , hence the sixth object ( pg 1538 + 447 at @xmath6 = 0.770 ) in the iue list was not observed .",
    "the four other qsos in the present sample are objects with significant flux at the lyman edge and shortward of the lyman edge extending to rest wavelengths @xmath7 800  .",
    "in pg 1630 + 377 the rise in @xmath1 occurs at rest wavelengths of 770  and below .",
    "the shortest wavelength which could be observed for the present sample was defined either by ( a ) the shortest wavelength at which the fos polarimeter could work , which was 1600  , or ( b ) the existence in most objects of a sharp lyman edge due to foreground gas at a lower redshift than the qso .",
    "this latter constraint is often a significant one .",
    "the present sample consists of six radio quiet qsos which are given in table 1 .",
    "we observed the six objects , in cycles 5 and 6 , with the _ hst / fos _ spectropolarimeter to determine the amount of polarization on both sides of the lyman limit at 912  .",
    "the targets were acquired in the 4.@xmath83 aperture using the binary acquisition procedure of the fos .",
    "all observations were obtained using the fos blue detector and the 1.0 arcsecond aperture .",
    "details of the observations are given in table 1 .",
    "except for pg 0117 + 213 all observations were obtained at 8 waveplate positions using the ` b ' waveplate , which is optimized for uv observations .",
    "pg 0117 + 213 was observed at 4 waveplate positions , since these observations were conducted before the change in the fos spectropolarimetric observing strategy recommended by the fos team . because of the fewer waveplate positions , the pg 0117 + 213 data can not be corrected as accurately for the fos instrumental polarization ( see details below ) .",
    "the polarimetry calibrations are described in allen & smith ( 1992 ) .",
    "the data were recalibrated using allen s calibration program,``polar '' , because the current stsdas pipeline calibration of polarization data is inadequate for post - costar data .",
    "the basic calibration procedure is described in the _ hst data handbook _ ( 1997 ) .",
    "the various calibration steps are : ( 1 ) correction for dead diodes , ( 2 ) conversion to count rates , ( 3 ) subtraction of the background , ( 4 ) flat field correction , ( 5 ) computation of the wavelength solution , ( 6 ) conversion to absolute flux , ( 7 ) correction for the wavelength - dependent fos instrumental polarization , and ( 8) calculation of the stokes parameters . in the post - calibration data reduction , the data were binned in various ways , depending on the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the different data sets .",
    "the introduction of the costar mirrors introduced two @xmath07   reflections in front of the fos polarizer .",
    "these reflections therefore convert some of the linear polarization into circular polarization requiring a correction to the linear polarization data . the residual wavelength dependent instrumental polarization is @xmath9 0.2% in observations of unpolarized standard stars after this correction is performed .",
    "figure 1 shows the costar induced polarization in the unpolarized standard star bd+284211 .",
    "the discontinuity seen in @xmath10 around 2700 is due to the break between the g190h and g270h gratings ; each grating has a separate wavelength dependent correction .",
    "figure 2 shows the polarization spectrum of bd+284211 after the costar correction has been applied",
    ". the instrumental polarization due to costar can be corrected to @xmath00.08% , except in the wavelength range 1800 to 2100 where the retardation of the waveplate goes through 180(see figure 2 ) .",
    "the other sources of error in polarization are due to photon statistics of the observations and the error in the retardation calibration ( 2% of the linear polarization ; allen & smith 1992 ) .",
    "the space craft `` jitter '' , i.e. , the telescope motion introduced due to the thermal instability of the solar panels , is 0.007 arcsec ( 1@xmath11 error ) .",
    "this rarely introduced a photometric error of @xmath2 1% ( because the size of the fos diodes was much larger than the jitter excursions ) .",
    "therefore , we find that space craft jitter does not produce polarization greater than 1% .",
    "interstellar polarization is seen to peak in the optical and then falls rapidly in the uv ( clayton 1992 ; somerville 1994 ) , therefore we do not expect interstellar polarization to be significant in our targets .    a note on how polarizations are calculated and manipulated should be made here .",
    "since @xmath12 is a positive - definite quantity , it is often replaced by a `` debiased '' quantity , involving not only @xmath13 and @xmath10 but also their uncertainties . as miller et al .",
    "( 1988 ) show , however , the error distribution of the debiasing method normally used in optical polarimetry has a rather unsatisfactory form .",
    "simmons & stewart ( 1985 ) discuss various debiasing schemes . throughout this paper",
    "we choose to quote the standard , biased polarization , @xmath14 .",
    "this has the advantage of making the original stokes parameters more readily accessible to the reader .",
    "we stress that all _ calculations _ , such as correction for instrumental polarizations or averaging over wavelength bins , are done on @xmath13 and @xmath10 , which are essentially unbiased .",
    "the binned @xmath13 , @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath15 are given in table 2 and the figures 3  8 show the stokes parameters @xmath16 ( % ) , @xmath17 ( % ) , and total flux for each object . in section 3",
    "we have calculated the 95% confidence level upper limits on polarization using the confidence intervals derived by simmons & stewart ( 1985 ) .",
    "the new objects generally have low polarization .",
    "a brief description of each one follows .",
    "this object was fitted by a massive thin accretion disk by laor ( 1990 ) .",
    "it was selected in this sample because of the partial systemic edge seen with iue .",
    "our fos observations show that the lyman edge region in this object is highly affected by intervening material at @xmath19 ( noted by koratkar , kinney & bohlin 1992 ) , which has associated ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath20 absorption lines ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "longward of the lyman edge there are hints of polarization . since the position angle is approximately constant with wavelength , one could combine all the bins longward of the lyman edge and get polarization @xmath1 = 0.8@xmath210.5% at @xmath15 = 116@xmath219 , but the uncertainty here includes a large ( 0.4% ) contribution from uncertainties in the post - costar polarization correction , given that it was taken in polscan = 4 mode rather than polscan = 8 .",
    "the bias corrected optical polarization in pg 0117 + 213 is 0.44@xmath210.22% at @xmath15 = 90@xmath2115   ( berriman et al.1990 ) .",
    "the observed optical and uv polarizations are essentially consistent .",
    "no polarization is detected shortward of the lyman edge .",
    "the upper limits of the uv linear polarization ( 95% confidence level as derived by simmons & stewart 1985 ) , shortward and longward of the lyman limit are @xmath1 = 1.4% and 1.6% respectively ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this object was also selected for an apparent partial systemic lyman edge in the iue total - flux spectrum .",
    "however , our fos data show no lyman edge .",
    "koratkar , kinney & bohlin ( 1992 ) had noted that this object was a `` weak '' candidate for a discontinuity at the lyman edge due to an accretion disk , because they could not evaluate the significance of the lyman edge discontinuity in the low signal - to - noise iue data .",
    "no polarization is detected either shortward or longward of the lyman edge .",
    "( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the upper limits of the uv linear polarization are @xmath1 = 7.5% and 0.9% , shortward and longward of the lyman limit respectively ( see table 3 ) .",
    "hints of polarization both shortward and longward of the edge position are seen .",
    "since the position angles for all the bins are close , one could combine them to produce @xmath23% , @xmath24% ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this object is near the north galactic pole where little interstellar polarization is expected .",
    "pg 1247 + 267 shows optical polarization of 0.41@xmath210.18% at @xmath15 = 97@xmath2112  ( berriman 1990 ) consistent with the _ hst / fos _ uv data ( @xmath1 = 0.6@xmath210.3% at @xmath15 = 118@xmath2112 ; upper limit on polarization is 1.1% ; see table 3 ) .      in this object , at longer wavelengths",
    "there is a marginal detection in @xmath13 at the very edge of the g270h grating at 3180  ( see figure 6 and table 2 )",
    ". the uv polarization in the wavelength range longward of the lyman edge is @xmath1 = 0.6@xmath210.3% at @xmath15 = 76@xmath2115 .",
    "if real , it is probably not from dust in the galaxy at this sky position and this far into the uv .",
    "the optical polarization from berriman ( 1990 ) is 0.30@xmath210.15% at @xmath15 = 97@xmath2114 , which is consistent with the _ hst / fos _ data .    at the shortest wavelength bin ( rest wavelength of @xmath0714  )",
    "there may be a marginal detection of polarization .",
    "if real , this would be at the wavelengths where we would have expected to see a rise in polarization similar to that seen in paper i. since the detection of polarization is in a single wavelength bin and it has low significance , the data are also consistent with no detection of polarization shortward of the lyman edge .",
    "once again , the upper limits of the uv linear polarization , shortward and longward of the lyman limit are @xmath1 = 3.3% and 1.4% respectively ( see table 3 ) .",
    "all data are consistent with zero polarization ( see figure 7 ) , while the optical polarization from berriman ( 1990 ) is 0.40@xmath210.08% at @xmath15 = 76@xmath216 .",
    "the upper limits of the uv linear polarization , shortward and longward of the lyman limit are @xmath1 = 1.0% and 0.9% respectively ( see table 3 ) .",
    "all data are consistent with zero polarization ( see figure 8) . the uv linear polarization upper limits , shortward and longward of the lyman limit are @xmath1 = 2.8% and 0.6% respectively ( see table 3 ) .",
    "of the six qsos identified by koratkar , kinney & bohlin ( 1992 ) as candidate targets which have partial lyman edges consistent with edges from simple thin accretion disks , we now have spectropolarimetric observations for five qsos .",
    "we showed in section 3.2 that one of these candidates , 0743@xmath22673 no longer qualifies as a partial lyman edge object .",
    "there are only 13 high and intermediate redshift qsos which have spectropolarimetry observations shortward of the lyman edge region .",
    "these objects come from this paper , koratkar ( 1995 ) , impey ( 1995 ) , and antonucci ( 1996 ) . at this point",
    "any detailed statistical tests of polarization distributions are certainly not warranted given the inhomogeneous selection criteria and data quality , and the highly model - dependent predictions . yet",
    ", lyman edge spectropolarimetry results can be summarized as follows :    * of the 13 objects only three objects ( pg 1630 + 377 , pg 1338 + 416 and pg 1222 + 228 from paper i and impey 1995 ) show significant polarization at wavelengths shorter than 912 ( lyman edge ) . to these three objects",
    "we can add one more marginal detection ( pks 0405@xmath22123 from paper i ) .",
    "all 13 objects in the sample show a polarization signature which is inconsistent with any simple accretion disk model .",
    "furthermore , @xmath030% of the sample show a rise in polarization shortward of the lyman edge .",
    "this observed rise in polarization is qualitatively consistent with the disk models of blaes & agol ( 1996 ) .",
    "a number of different interpretations of the uv signature have been given by lee & blandford ( 1997 ) , shields , wobus & husfeld ( 1997 ) and by us in paper i. we urge the interested reader to consult those papers for more details .",
    "* there are a total of five objects ( pg 0117 + 213 from the present sample , pg1630 + 377 , pg 1338 + 416 , and pks 0405@xmath22123 from paper i , and 0014 + 813 from antonucci 1996 ) which show candidate partial lyman absorption edges due to accretion disks at the systemic redshift in total flux .",
    "of these five objects , two ( pg 1630 + 377 , pg 1338 + 416 ) have sufficient signal - to - noise at rest wavelengths of @xmath7750 , and show significant polarization shortward of the lyman edge ( at least a few percent , detected at four sigma or greater significance ) .",
    "if the rise in uv polarization seen in pg 1630 + 377 is characteristic of objects with partial lyman edges we need to observe rest wavelengths as short as @xmath0700 . the effective shortest rest wavelength observed in pg 0117 + 213 and pks 0405@xmath22123 is @xmath0800 .",
    "thus in these objects we could have missed the rise in polarization , although we do have a marginal detection for pks 0405@xmath22123 .",
    "0014 + 813 does not have sufficient signal - to - noise shortward of the lyman edge . to summarize , of the objects that show candidate partial lyman absorption edges in total flux",
    ", @xmath040% show polarization shortward of the lyman edge .",
    "* we have eight objects in the sample of 13 that do not show a partial lyman edge feature in total flux",
    ". only one object out of these , pg 1222 + 228 , from impey ( 1995 ) shows significant polarization shortward of the lyman edge ( @xmath1 = 4.6@xmath210.9% ) .",
    "the rest show no detection of polarization in the 912 spectral region .",
    "the linear polarization upper limits shortward of the lyman edge in the remaining objects is 4% . *",
    "pg 1630 + 377 is the best studied object ( see paper i ) , and shows uv polarization reaching 20% at 650 rest wavelength .",
    "such high degree of polarization is rare in ( non - blazar ) qsos .",
    "perhaps the simplest result of the current data is that it strengthens the conclusion that quasars are generally not polarized significantly just longward of the lyman edge at @xmath01000 .",
    "this paper , koratkar ( 1995 ) , impey ( 1995 ) , and antonucci ( 1996 ) together present good observations of about 20 objects in the region just longward of the lyman edge , all with low uv polarization ( 1.5% ) .",
    "further , there is no significant statistical wavelength dependence to the polarization as predicted by the models of laor et al ( 1990 ) . from these observations",
    "we conclude that simple plane - parallel atmospheres with scattering - dominated opacity are not significant sources of uv flux in quasars .    recapitulating the previous discussions here briefly",
    ", we note that models from the 1980s generally assumed that agn accretion disks are powered by viscous dissipation below the atmospheres , and that the atmospheric opacities are dominated by electron scattering opacity in the annuli that produce the rest optical and uv .",
    "this results in 0% to 11.7% polarization ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) , depending on inclination , and in a direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the disks .",
    "pioneering optical polarimetry observations showed much smaller polarizations , which are _ parallel _ to the axes when the latter could be inferred from a radio jet position angle ( stockman , angel & miley 1979 ; antonucci 1988 ) .",
    "to explain the low observed polarization , subsequent models by laor et al ( 1990 ) suggested that electron scattering was only important in the @xmath01000 - 2000  range , with the lyman continuum and free - free absorption opacity dominating shortwards and longwards of that interval respectively .",
    "other more detailed calculations revealed that a lower fraction of absorption opacity was required to reduce the predicted polarization than was assumed by laor et al ; and that under rather special circumstances a large polarization _",
    "parallel _ to the disk axis could be produced shortward of the lyman edge ( blaes and agol 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the observed rise in uv polarization shortward of the lyman edge has been interpreted both in the context of accretion disk models and non - disk related models .",
    "here we do not further discuss the polarization and depolarization mechanisms discussed in detail in paper i. an additional key complication in the accretion disk models , is that agn variability data require that the disk atmosphere is actually illuminated from above , ( e.g. antonucci 1988 , sincell and krolik 1996 ) , perhaps producing a strong polarization which can not be calculated rigorously without specification of the illumation geometry .",

    "<S> the lyman edge at 912  is an important diagnostic region for studying quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it reveals a great deal about the physical conditions within the atmospheres of accretion disks , a ubiquitous component of qso theories . a robust prediction of accretion disk models is a significant polarization due to electron scattering just longward ( in wavelength ) of the lyman edge because of the wavelength dependence of the hydrogen absorption opacity . </S>",
    "<S> observations of the lyman edge regions of qsos have shown scant evidence for the predicted features  </S>",
    "<S> few qsos show the broad , partial lyman edges expected to be common according to most theories , and none show the high polarizations expected longward of the lyman edge . </S>",
    "<S> still , polarization spectra of a small number of qsos have shown a rising polarization ( up to 20% ) at wavelengths _ shortward _ of the lyman edge . </S>",
    "<S> we have now doubled our sample of intermediate - redshift qsos observed with the _ hst / fos _ spectropolarimeter to determine the amount of polarization on both sides of the lyman limit . </S>",
    "<S> for this new sample of six objects , polarizations are low and mostly consistent with zero below the lyman edge .    another important result of the new data is that it strengthens the conclusion that quasars are generally not polarized significantly just longward of the lyman edge at @xmath01000 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no significant statistical wavelength dependence to the polarization longward of the lyman edge indicating that simple plane - parallel atmospheres with scattering - dominated opacity are not significant sources of uv flux in quasars . </S>"
