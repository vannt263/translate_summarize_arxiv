    "<S> prompted by a high optical state in september 2007 , the whole earth blazar telescope ( webt ) consortium organized an intensive optical , near - ir ( jhk ) and radio observing campaign on the intermediate bl  lac object 3c  66a throughout the fall and winter of 2007  2008 . in this paper , we present data from 28 observatories in 12 countries , covering the observing season from late july 2007 through february 2008 .    </S>",
    "<S> the source remained in a high optical state throughout the observing period and exhibited several bright flares on time scales of @xmath0  days . </S>",
    "<S> this included an exceptional outburst around september 15  20 , 2007 , reaching a peak brightness at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our campaign revealed microvariability with flux changes up to @xmath2  mag / hr .    our observations do not reveal evidence for systematic spectral variability in the overall high state covered by our campaign , in agreement with previous results . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we do not find evidence for spectral hysteresis in 3c  66a for which hints were found in an earlier campaign in a somewhat lower flux state . </S>",
    "<S> we did also not find any evidence for spectral lags in the discrete correlation functions between different optical bands .    </S>",
    "<S> we infer a value of the magnetic field in the emission region of @xmath3  g , where @xmath4 is the magnetic field equipartition fraction , @xmath5 is the shortest observed variability time scale in units of hours , and @xmath6 is the doppler factor in units of 10 . from the lack of systematic spectral variability , we can derive an upper limit on the doppler factor , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in perfect agreement with superluminal motion measurements with the vlbi / vlba of @xmath8 and argues against models with very high lorentz factors of @xmath9 , required for a one - zone synchrotron - self - compton interpretation of some high - frequency - peaked bl lac objects detected at tev @xmath10-ray energies . </S>"
