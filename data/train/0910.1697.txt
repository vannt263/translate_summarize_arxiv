    "the statistical model of the hadron resonance gas was shown to be very successful in addressing particle production in high - energy collisions @xcite .",
    "in central nucleus - nucleus collisions the formulation of conservation of quantum numbers ( sometimes generically referred to as charges ) in the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble is well suited @xcite .",
    "however , for small systems like @xmath0 or pp as well as for peripheral nucleus - nucleus collisions only the canonical ( c ) ensemble gives the correct description of hadron yields @xcite . in the gc formulation the conservation of charges",
    "is implemented on the average and is controlled by the appropriate chemical potentials whereas in the c - ensemble charges are conserved exactly @xcite .",
    "the exact treatment of quantum numbers in statistical mechanics is well established @xcite .",
    "it is in general obtained by projection of the partition function on the desired values of the conserved charges by using group theoretical methods @xcite . for studies of hadron production one",
    "needs in general to account for the exact conservation of five quantum numbers : the baryon number @xmath1 , strangeness @xmath2 , electric charge @xmath3 , charmness @xmath4 , and bottomness @xmath5 .",
    "the conservation is a direct consequence of the @xmath6 invariance of strong interactions .",
    "the implementation of an exact conservation of quantum numbers in the canonical partition function for the hadron resonance gas requires integration over the symmetry group @xcite . this in general leads to numerical problems due to the oscillatory behavior of the integrand .",
    "to avoid numerical problems , methods were developed to express the partition function as series of bessel functions which is well suited for numerical implementations @xcite .",
    "an explicit analytical expression for the canonical partition function using the above methods was obtained up to now only for three conserved quantum numbers i.e. for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and employing boltzmann statistics @xcite .    in the application of the statistical model to hadron production ,",
    "e.g. in @xmath0 annihilation , one must employ the formulation of the canonical partition function which accounts for the conservation of all five quantum numbers including charmness and botomness since hadrons carrying heavy quarks contribute sizably to the overall hadron yields @xcite .",
    "in addition , for @xmath0 collisions , the data are measured with high precision ; see @xcite for a recent summary .",
    "consequently , in the statistical model analysis the approximation of particle momentum distributions using boltzmann statistics is not sufficient @xcite .",
    "the main scope of this paper is the extension of the previous results for the canonical partition function for a hadron gas @xcite to include the exact conservation of all quantum numbers carried by the light and heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "we will formulate the canonical partition function as series of the modified bessel functions .",
    "our expression is numerically stable and can be used to quantify thermodynamics independently of the values of the thermal parameters and the initial quantum numbers .",
    "our result accounts for the quantum statistics for bosons . for all fermions",
    "the masses are significantly larger than the temperature .",
    "consequently , the implementation of boltzmann statistics for fermions is a very good approximation .",
    "an extension of our results to quantum statistics for all particles including fermions would however be quite straightforward .    as model implementation of the canonical partition function",
    "we illustrate its application to the calculations of hadron yields .",
    "we quantify the quantum statistics effects for the multiplicity of pions and kaons .",
    "we also discuss deviations from the exact quantum statistics results when the boltzmann approximation is used for different values of the thermal parameters .",
    "the hadron resonance gas we are working with is containing all known hadrons , including the multi - strange hyperons up to @xmath7 and all charmed and bottom hadrons , as listed in the latest compilation by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we derive the analytical expression for the canonical partition function that accounts for the conservation of five quantum numbers . in section 3 we present a particular numerical implementation to calculate the pion and kaon multiplicities and discuss the role of quantum statistics .",
    "we summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "the appropriate tool to deal in a statistical mechanics framework with a system of quantum numbers @xmath8 related with the @xmath6 symmetry group is the canonical partition function @xcite ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 where the vector @xmath11=@xmath12 characterizes the initial quantum numbers of a system related with each of the @xmath13 symmetry groups and the @xmath14 sign refers to fermions and bosons . the exact quantum number conservation is implemented by the integration over the group @xmath15 with @xmath16 being an element of @xmath15 .",
    "the vector @xmath17 describes the quantum numbers of a particle @xmath18 with mass @xmath19 and the spin - isospin degeneracy factor @xmath20 .",
    "the sum in the exponential is taken over all particles and resonances which carry quantum numbers related with an internal symmetry @xmath15 .",
    "the partition function ( [ eq : partition6 ] ) depends only on two parameters , the temperature @xmath21 and the volume @xmath22 of the system .",
    "however , the integral representation of this partition function is very inconvenient for numerical implementations .",
    "this is particularly the case for non - vanishing initial quantum numbers due to the oscillatory nature of the integrand .",
    "an additional complication appears due to quantum statistics effects .",
    "clearly , one could simplify the problem and employ the boltzmann approximation by keeping only the first term of the series expansion of the @xmath23 in the exponential .",
    "however , such an approximation is only valid if the particle mass is significantly larger than the temperature . as the values of temperatures extracted from the fits of hadron abundances obtained in heavy ion and elementary collisions @xcite are close to the pion mass",
    ", the boltzmann approximation will give rise to deviations from the correct quantum statistics values in particular for light particles like pions or kaons . to calculate the partition function accurately ( using quantum statistics )",
    "one needs in general to include the whole series of the expansion of the logarithm @xmath24 in the partition function for all particle species .",
    "however , as the fermions are heavy , the error caused by the boltzmann approximation in this case is very small .",
    "therefore we will use the whole series of the logarithm only for light bosons ( mesons without charm or bottom quarks ) and apply the usual boltzmann approximation to fermions and heavy bosons ( bosons containing charm or bottom quarks ) . with this approximation equation ( [ eq : partition6 ] )",
    "becomes : @xmath25 with the particle partition function @xmath26 where @xmath18 runs over all particles , while @xmath27 runs only over the light bosons .    for charm and bottom hadrons ,",
    "because of their large masses the term @xmath28 is much less is @xmath29 for charm particles and @xmath30 for bottom particles ] than 1 .",
    "consequently , we can use the following approximation @xcite : @xmath31 inserting now eq .",

    ". consequently , @xmath38 where @xmath11 and @xmath39 are now three - dimensional vectors composed of the baryon number , the strangeness and the electric charge , while the charmness @xmath4 and bottomness @xmath5 appear only through the kronecker functions .    with the approximation ( [ eq : partition9 ] ) for charm and bottom contributions to the generating functional",
    "we have reduced the five dimensional integrations to three dimensional ones in the canonical partition function .",
