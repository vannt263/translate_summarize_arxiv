    "the chiral phase transition is very difficult to tackle analytically .",
    "the main obstacles which arise are twofold .",
    "qcd as the microscopic theory of strong interactions is formulated in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the ir behavior of strong interactions is , however , dominated by collective degrees of freedom like mesons . for instance , the relevant modes for the chirally broken phase are goldstone bosons which , in qcd , are quark  antiquark bound states .",
    "furthermore , for the relevant length scales the running gauge coupling @xmath1 is large and a perturbative treatment is questionable .    a popular way to circumvent",
    "the first difficulty is the use of effective field theories for the most important degrees of freedom .",
    "the most prominent example is chiral perturbation theory based on the nonlinear sigma model @xcite which describes the ir behavior of qcd in terms of the goldstone bosons of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this yields a very successful effective formulation of strong interactions dynamics for momentum scales up to several hundred @xmath2 or temperatures of several @xmath3 . for somewhat higher scales",
    "additional degrees of freedom like the sigma meson or the light quark flavors will become important and should be included explicitly .",
    "we will therefore rather work with an effective linear quark meson model @xcite . here",

    "the effect of explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to non  vanishing current quark masses is represented by an external source @xmath17 for the scalar meson field @xmath4 .",

    "the success of the njl  model to describe the strong chiral dynamics at low energies ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) serves as a further support for the use of ( [ gammaeffective ] ) .",
    "our motivation to consider the linear quark meson model as an effective field theory for the ir behavior of qcd is , however , not only limited to the relation of  ( [ gammaeffective ] ) to njl  models .",
    "it can be demonstrated that , similarly to chiral perturbation theory , also within the scalar part of the linear quark meson model a systematic expansion of observables like meson masses or decay constants in powers of the light current quark masses is possible  @xcite .",
    "this allows for a successful `` prediction '' of the light quark mass ratios  @xcite and a computation of several of the @xmath22 coefficients of higher dimensional operators of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite in good agreement with the results of other methods .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the two lightest quark flavors and neglect isospin violation .",
    "furthermore , we decouple the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 isotriplet .",
    "this is justified by their relatively large masses and can be achieved for @xmath25 in a chirally invariant manner .",
    "this leaves us with the @xmath0symmetric gell  mann  levy model for the three pions and the sigma meson coupled here , however , to the up and the down quarks ( instead of the nucleons ) .",
    "it should be noted , though , that our justification for the decoupling of the @xmath23 meson is less clear at finite temperature .",
    "it has been speculated  @xcite that close to the chiral transition temperature an effective restoration of the axial @xmath26 symmetry might take place . in this case",
    "the @xmath23 would become degenerate with the pions even in the spontaneously broken phase . in principle",
    "this question could be address within the linear quark meson model by allowing for a finite explicitly @xmath26 breaking scalar interaction term @xmath27 in the effective average potential @xmath15 .",
    "this would lead to a finite @xmath23 mass even in the chiral limit and the temperature dependence of the coupling @xmath28 would yield the require information about an approximate restoration of @xmath26 within the linear quark meson model .",
    "we leave this generalization of our model to future work .",
    "we furthermore note that even within this relatively simple effective model we have to deal with strong couplings .",
    "for instance , the renormalized yukawa coupling acquires a value @xmath29 to reproduce a realistic constituent quark mass of @xmath30 .",

    "the flow equations for the @xmath52 @xmath67point functions @xmath68 are obtained by functional differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ erge ] ) .",
    "the formation of mesonic bound states  @xcite , which typically appear as poles in the ( minkowskian ) four  quark green function , is most efficiently described by an expansion like ( [ fieldexp ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", a parameterization of @xmath48 as in ( [ derexp ] ) seems particularly suited for the study of phase transitions and will therefore be our choice here .",
    "our ansatz for the effective average action of the linear quark meson model is provided by ( [ gammaeffective ] ) . inserting it into the exact rg equation  ( [ erge ] )",
    "this complicated functional differential equation is converted into a set of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations for the @xmath11dependence of the two wave function renormalizations @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the yukawa coupling @xmath14 and the effective average potential @xmath15 . for the sake of brevity we will not display here the full set of flow equations and refer the interested reader to  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , illustrative to consider the flow equation for the effective average potential as an example . with the abbreviations @xmath69 where @xmath70 it",
    "is given by @xmath71 here @xmath72 and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "we will always use in the following @xmath74 for the number of quark colors and @xmath75 .",
    "( [ eq:3034 ] ) is a partial differential equation which governs the flow of the effective average potential @xmath76 with @xmath11 starting from a fixed uv scale to @xmath77 .",
    "supplemented by similar ( but ordinary ) differential equations for the flow of the remaining parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 it can be solved numerically on a computer .",
    "an important nonperturbative ingredient appearing in all these flow equations and , in particular , also in  ( [ eq:3034 ] ) are so called mass threshold functions . full definitions of all threshold functions relevant for the truncation  ( [ gammaeffective ] ) of the linear quark meson model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a typical example appearing in  ( [ eq:3034 ] ) is @xmath81^{n+1}}\\ ] ] with @xmath82 .",
    "these functions decrease monotonically with @xmath83 and decay @xmath84 for @xmath85 where @xmath86 can be seen from  ( [ eq:3034 ] ) to be a renormalized scalar mass of the model .",
    "this implies that the main effect of the threshold functions is to cut off quantum fluctuations of particles with masses @xmath87 .",
    "these functions therefore automatically and smoothly decouple massive modes from the evolution of the system whenever @xmath11 becomes smaller than the ( @xmath11dependent ) mass of a particle .",
    "the relevant masses typically receive contributions from arbitrarily high powers of the coupling constants of the theory and are therefore nonperturbative in nature .",
    "in fact , this nonperturbative dependence of the flow equations on the coupling constants of the model is already manifest in  ( [ erge ] ) .",
    "the second functional derivative @xmath88 generically depends on all couplings present in the effective average action which therefore appear in denominators of the beta functions for these very same couplings .",
    "this nonperturbative dependence of the beta functions on the couplings is an important difference to polchinski s exact rg equation  @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to a resummation of the contributions from infinitely many feynman diagrams already at the level of the beta functions .",
    "it is the main reason that nonperturbative problems like the computation of critical exponents ( see below ) can be carried out in a straightforward way .",
    "we will assume that the linear quark meson model is a reasonable effective description of the chiral ir dynamics of qcd for scales @xmath11 below a `` compositeness scale '' @xmath16 where the mesons are assumed to form due to strong gluonic interactions .",
    "for a solution of our coupled set of rg equations for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 we therefore need initial conditions at the scale @xmath89 .",
    "we motivate these conditions by exploiting the relation of the linear quark meson model to the njl  model . there",
    "the scalar meson field @xmath4 is introduced as an auxiliary field for @xmath90 .",
    "this implies that its wave function renormalization @xmath12 vanishes at the compositeness scale .",
    "furthermore , in the njl  limit the effective average potential @xmath15 is a purely quadratic function of @xmath4 with a positive mass squared coefficient @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the four  fermi coupling of the njl  model",
    ". we will be somewhat more general here and allow for a non  vanishing by small scalar wave function renormalization @xmath93 at the compositeness scale .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the effective average potential is almost quadratic for @xmath90 .",
    "more precisely , we take a starting function @xmath94 which has its absolute minimum at the origin @xmath95 but is otherwise unrestricted . the two remaining initial conditions can be freely chosen as @xmath96 .",
    "the condition on the effective average potential implies that the evolution of the system starts at @xmath16 in the chirally symmetric regime . clearly ,",
    "because of quark fluctuations with a large renormalized yukawa coupling , the scalar mass squared term will decrease with @xmath11 and finally turn negative , therefore spontaneously breaking chiral symmetry .",
    "this typically happens at scales @xmath97 well above @xmath98 .",
    "this may serve as a qualitative justification for the neglect of confinement effects in this as well as in the limiting njl  model : the only degrees of freedom in the model which experience confinement directly are the two light quark flavors . yet",
    ", they acquire a constituent mass of the same order as @xmath99 before @xmath11 gets too close to @xmath100 .",
    "they will therefore decouple from the evolution of the mesonic system before confinement effects start to modify the quark propagator significantly .",
    "the smallness of @xmath101 implies that all mesons have large renormalized masses near @xmath16 and therefore decouple effectively . the model is thus dominated by quark fluctuations for the beginning of its @xmath11evolution . as a consequence , the flow equations exhibit an approximate partial ir fixed point not far below @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , except for the meson mass term all scalar self interactions contained in @xmath15 divided by appropriate powers of the renormalized yukawa coupling rapidly approach fixed points and almost all information about the initial conditions at @xmath16 is washed out .",
    "this implies an enormous predictive power of the exact rg analysis of the linear quark meson model which goes far beyond the chiral ward identities and has been successfully tested  @xcite .",
    "there are only three unknown parameters left in our model which have to be fixed using phenomenological input : the ( bare ) scalar mass @xmath20 at @xmath16 as the only relevant initial condition , the compositeness scale @xmath16 itself and the average light current quark mass @xmath102 . using @xmath103 , @xmath104 and a constituent mass @xmath105 as input we find e.g. , @xmath106 .",
    "the introduction of finite temperature in the exact rg formalism is straightforward . since we are working in @xmath107 euclidean space time , at finite @xmath108 the @xmath107 momentum integral implicitly contained in the trace in  ( [ erge ] )",
    "is replaced in the standard way by a @xmath109 integration times a matsubara sum .",
    "consequently , all scalar and fermion degrees of freedom are substituted by infinite towers of matsubara modes with increasing @xmath108dependent masses .",
    "technically , one can treat @xmath108 as an external parameter and evolve the effective average action ( [ gammaeffective ] ) for each value of @xmath108 from @xmath16 to @xmath77 using  ( [ erge ] ) . in this context",
    "it is important that the initial conditions at @xmath16 for the rg flow discussed above are practically insensitive to @xmath108effects up to temperatures of approximately @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "it is crucial that the decoupling of massive modes through threshold functions also works for matsubara masses .",
    "for instance , eq .  ( [ aaa85 ] )",
    "is now replaced by @xmath111^{n+1 } }     } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 using @xmath113 we see that the squared scalar mass @xmath114 is effectively replaced in  ( [ aaa85b ] ) by the matsubara masses @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "the threshold functions therefore automatically decouple all massive matsubara modes as @xmath11 is lowered and the model is dimensionally reduced in a smooth way .",
    "this procedure yields , for instance , the full effective potential as a function of @xmath4 , @xmath108 and the external source @xmath17 and therefore the equation of state @xmath117 which contains the @xmath108dependence of various observables . in fig .",
    "[ ccc_t ] we show the chiral condensate @xmath118 as a function of @xmath119 .",

    "@xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 correspond to @xmath124 , respectively . for each pair of curves",
    "the lower one represents the full @xmath108dependence of @xmath118 whereas the upper one shows for comparison the universal scaling form of the equation of state for the @xmath0 heisenberg model .",
    "we see a sharp second order phase transition in the chiral limit ( this claim will be substantiated further below by demonstrating the appropriate critical behavior near @xmath125 ) .        for non  vanishing quark masses this changes into a smooth crossover which becomes smoother for increasing @xmath102 .",
    "the values for the respective ( pseudo)critical temperatures are given in table  [ tab11 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath128 for the largest pion mass , computed within this very simple effective model , is quite close to the result of current full two flavor qcd monte carlo simulations performed for comparable quark masses  @xcite .",
    "we consider this as an indication that our model yields indeed even quantitatively a reasonable description of the chiral transition .",
    "this hold for non  universal as well as for universal properties of the transition as will be demonstrated below .",
    "this claim is further substantiated by the following consideration : because of the relatively large sigma mass  @xcite , for low temperatures the linear quark meson model is well approximated by the nonlinear sigma model .",
    "in fact , our @xmath129 curve rather accurately agrees with that of chiral perturbation theory for @xmath130 as shown in figure  [ cc_t ] . here",
    "the solid line displays the exact rg result for vanishing average current quark mass @xmath131 whereas the dashed line shows the corresponding result of three  loop chiral perturbation theory  @xcite on the other hand , in the vicinity of @xmath125 the universal behavior of the model sets in which is independent of the details of the effective action used in our approach and also accurately described by our method as demonstrated below .",
