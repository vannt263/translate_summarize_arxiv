    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is one of the most compelling theories to describe physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the framework of a generic @xmath4-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm , the mssm  @xcite ,",
    "susy particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable . in a large variety of models ,",
    "the lsp is the lightest neutralino , @xmath5 , which is weakly interacting and is a possible candidate for dark matter .",
    "the coloured superpartners of quarks and gluons , the squarks ( @xmath6 ) and gluinos ( @xmath7 ) , are expected to be copiously produced via the strong interaction at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the partners of the right - handed and left - handed quarks , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , can mix to form two mass eigenstates .",
    "these mixing effects are proportional to the corresponding fermion masses and therefore become important for the third generation . in particular , large mixing can yield sbottom ( @xmath10 ) and stop ( @xmath11 ) mass eigenstates that are significantly lighter than other squarks .",
    "consequently , @xmath10 and @xmath11 could be produced with large cross sections at the lhc , either via direct pair production or , if kinematically allowed , through @xmath12 production with subsequent @xmath13 or @xmath14 decays .",
    "depending on the susy particle mass spectrum , the cascade decays of gluino - mediated and pair - produced sbottoms or stops result in complex final states consisting of missing transverse momentum ( its magnitude is referred to as @xmath15 in the following ) and several jets , among which @xmath16-quark jets ( @xmath16-jets ) are expected .",
    "susy is searched for in final states involving @xmath15 , energetic jets , of which at least one must be identified as a @xmath16-jet and no isolated leptons ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) . the search is based on @xmath17 collision data at a centre - of - mass energy of 7  tev recorded by the atlas experiment  @xcite at the lhc in 2011 . the total data set included in the analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.83  @xmath18 .",
    "two phenomenological mssm scenarios are considered where the first and second generation squark masses are set above 2 tev . in the first scenario ,",
    "the @xmath10 is the lightest squark , @xmath19 , and the branching ratio for @xmath13 decays is 100% .",
    "sbottoms are produced via gluino - mediated processes or via direct pair production and they are assumed to decay exclusively via @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is fixed at 60  gev .",
    "the interpretation of the results is presented as a function of the gluino and light sbottom masses .",
    "the second mssm - like scenario is defined in the context of the general simplified models  @xcite : all squarks including @xmath10 are heavy , gluino - pair production is the only kinematically allowed process and gluinos decay ( off - shell ) into  @xmath22 final states . here",
    "the results are interpreted in a ( @xmath23 ) plane .",
    "these results are generalized to any new physics process where gluino - like particles decay into @xmath24 and a weakly interacting massive particle .",
    "simulated event samples are used to determine the detector acceptance , the reconstruction efficiencies and the expected event yields for signal and background processes .",
    "samples of susy signal processes were simulated for various models using the herwig++  @xcite v2.4.2 monte carlo program .",
    "the particle mass spectra and decay modes were determined using the susyhit  @xcite v1.3 program , and parametrized in the ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) planes .",
    "the susy sample yields are then normalized to the expectations from next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations obtained using the prospino  @xcite v2.1 program . for these calculations",
    "the cteq6.6 m  @xcite parametrisation of the parton density functions ( pdfs ) is used and the renormalization and factorisation scales are set to the average mass of the sparticles produced in the hard interaction .",
    ".the most important background processes and their predicted cross sections , multiplied by the relevant branching ratios ( br ) before any event selection .",
    "a generator level cut @xmath27  gev was applied to the @xmath28 process .",
    "contributions from higher order qcd corrections are included for @xmath29 and @xmath30 boson production ( nnlo corrections ) and for @xmath31  production ( nlo+nnll corrections ) . [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]     since no excess with respect to the sm predictions",
    "is observed in the data , the results are translated into 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits on contributions from new physics .",
    "limits are derived using the @xmath32  @xcite method , while the power constrained limit ( pcl )  @xcite method is used for comparison with previous atlas results .",

    "the nlo cross sections are calculated using prospino . for each scenario , the signal region resulting in the best expected exclusion limit is used : the selection 3jd provides the best sensitivity in most cases . if @xmath33  gev , signal regions with 1 are preferred , due to the lower number of expected above @xmath34thresholds .",
    "the regions 3ja and 3jb provide the best sensitivity when @xmath35 and sbottom pair production dominates .",
    "all systematic uncertainties on the signal and background contributions are taken into account in these limits and include the fully - correlated detector - type uncertainties ( jes , , trigger , pile - up effects , luminosity ) as well as the theoretical uncertainties on the signal ( renormalization / factorization scale and pdf ) .",
    "gluino masses below 720  gev are excluded for sbottom masses up to 600  gev .",
    "the exclusion is less stringent in the region with low @xmath36 , where low @xmath37is expected .",
    "this search extends the previous atlas exclusion limit in the same scenario by about 130  gev @xcite ( 180  gev if using the same limit setting procedure ) .",
    "results are also interpreted in the context of simplified models . in this case , all the squarks are heavier than the gluino , which decays exclusively into three - body final states ( @xmath22 ) via an off - shell sbottom . such a scenario can be considered complementary to the previous one .",
