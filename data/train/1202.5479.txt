    "the factoring of decision processes interacting with continuous evolution plays an important role in model - based optimization for many applications .",
    "for example , when optimally controlling chemical processes there are often both continuous decisions such as inlet and outlet flows , as well as discrete decisions , such as the operation of on  off valves and pumps that may redirect flows within the reactor , @xcite .",
    "such mixed - integer optimal control problems are therefore studied in different communities with different approaches .",
    "most of these approaches address problems that are governed by systems of ordinary differential equations in euclidean spaces , see @xcite for a survey on this topic .",
    "total discretization of the underlying system obviously leads to typically large mixed - integer nonlinear programs .",
    "hence , relaxation techniques have become an integral part of efficient mixed - integer optimal control algorithms , either in the context of branch - and - bound type methods or , more directly , by means of nonlinear optimal control methods combined with suitable rounding strategies .",
    "an important result is that the solution of the relaxed problem can be approximated with arbitrary precision by a solution fulfilling the integer requirements @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend such relaxation techniques to problems that are governed by certain systems of partial differential equations .",
    "motivating applications are for example to switch between reductive and oxidative conditions in order to maximize the performance in a monolithic catalyst @xcite , port switching in chromatographic separation processes @xcite , or to optimize switching control within photochemical reactions @xcite .",
    "our problem setting also includes the switching control design in the sense that systems are equipped with multiple actuators and the optimizer has to choose one of these together with ordinary controls for each instant in time .    concerning systems involving partial differential equations ,",
    "such switching control design has already been studied using several techniques : in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  8) optimal switching controls are constructed for systems governed by abstract semilinear evolution equations by combining ideas from dynamic programming and approximations of the value function using viscosity solutions of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equations .",
    "switching boundary control for linear transport equations using switching time sensitivities has been studied in @xcite .",
    "exemplary for the heat equation and based on variational methods , the controllability in case of switching among several actuators has been considered in @xcite and null - controllability for the one - dimensional wave equation with switching boundary control has been considered in @xcite . based on linear quadratic regulator optimal control techniques and enumeration of the integer values for a fixed time discretization ,",
    "optimal switching control of abstract linear systems has been considered in @xcite .",
    "our approach is complementary to the above , as we break the computationally very expensive combinatorial complexity of the problem by relaxation .",
    "this comes at the downside of providing only a suboptimal solution and possibly at the price of fast switching but , as we will see , with arbitrary small integer - optimality gap , depending on discretization , and extensions to limit the number of switching .",
    "we will be concerned with the following problem of mixed - integer optimal control : minimize a cost functional @xmath0 over trajectories @xmath1 } \\subset \\{z{\\mathcal{\\colon}}[0,t_f ] \\to x\\}$ ] and control functions @xmath2 } \\subset \\{u { \\mathcal{\\colon}}[0,t_f ] \\to u\\}$ ] and @xmath3 } \\subset \\{v { \\mathcal{\\colon}}[0,t_f ] \\to v\\}$ ] subject to the constraints that @xmath4 is a mild solution of the operator differential equation @xmath5\\\\   & z(0)=z_0 \\in x \\end{aligned}\\right.\\ ] ] and that the control functions satisfy @xmath6\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are banach spaces , @xmath10}$ ] , @xmath11}$ ] and @xmath12}$ ] are normed linear spaces , @xmath13 is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup @xmath14 on @xmath7 , @xmath15 is a fixed real number , @xmath16   \\times x \\times u \\times v \\to x$ ] , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given functions , @xmath19 is some subset of @xmath8 and @xmath20 is a finite subset of @xmath9 .",
    "this setting is for the most part classical , except for the assumptions on @xmath20",
    ".    we will refer to the above infinite - dimensional dynamic optimization problem as mixed - integer optimal control problem , short ( miocp ) , and to the control function @xmath21 $ ] as a mixed - integer control .",
    "this accounts for the fact that we do not impose restrictions on the set @xmath22 while we can always identify the finite set @xmath23 of the feasible control values for @xmath24 with a finite number of integers @xmath25 moreover , the operator differential equation is an abstract representation of certain initial - boundary value problems governed by linear and semilinear partial differential equations , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the existence of an optimal solution of the problem ( miocp ) depends , inter alia , on the spaces @xmath10}$ ] , @xmath11}$ ] and @xmath12}$ ] where we seek @xmath26 \\to x$ ] , @xmath27 \\to u$ ] and @xmath28 \\to v$ ] , respectively .",

    "we defer these considerations by assuming later that there exists an optimal solution of a related ( to a certain extent convexified and relaxed ) optimal control problem and present sufficient conditions guaranteeing that the solution of the relaxed problem can be approximated with arbitrary precision by a solution satisfying the integer restrictions .",
    "we do only assume that @xmath10 } \\subset c([0,t_f];x)$ ] , @xmath11}\\subset l^1(0,t_f;u)$ ] and @xmath12 } \\subset l^1(0,t_f;v)$ ] to ensure that certain quantities in problem ( miocp ) are well - defined .",

    "this is proved in @xcite for the case when @xmath7 is a separable banach space and in @xcite for non - separable banach spaces .",
    "while these results rely on powerful selection theorems , our main contribution is a constructive proof based on discretization , giving rise to a numerical method at the prize of additional regularity assumptions .",

    ", can thus be carried over to the mixed - integer problem under consideration here .",
    "we also discuss the possibility to include state - constraints for example enforcing time - periodicity constraints @xmath42 as occurring in chromatographic separation processes @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that we target at a solution that is only suboptimal ( though with arbitrary precision ) and that switching costs , a standard regularization of mixed - integer problems to prevent chattering solutions , or additional combinatorial constraints can lead to larger optimality / feasibility gaps .",
    "nevertheless , we will show how a - priori bounds for such a gap can be obtained when constraints on the number of switches are incorporated .",
    "the framework we use for the analysis here will be semigroup theory . recall that for given @xmath43 and given control functions @xmath44 , the mild solution of the state equation is given by a function @xmath45 satisfying the variation of constants formula @xmath46 in the lebesgue - bochner sense .",
