    "optical surveys within our galaxy are severely hampered by dust obscuration ; therefore complete samples must be obtained with longer wavelength observations . here",
    "we describe a survey in the galactic plane at k - band wavelengths , where the extinction is much lower than traditional v - band surveys .",
    "our scientific driver is the discovery of the young stellar population in our galaxy through the detection of evolved massive stars .",
    "these stars have strong emission lines , which makes them relatively easy to detect using narrow - band filters .    as a massive o star evolves ,",
    "its spectrum becomes dominated by emission lines , arising either in a dense stellar wind , or in circumstellar material produced by mass loss .",
    "stellar emission lines are most pronounced in wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars which have lifetimes @xmath0  10  myr , and thus are excellent tracers of recent star formation , and so also galactic structure .",
    "a complete sample of galactic wr stars will also enable us to understand the distribution of wn and wc sub - types in a high metallicity environment .",
    "additionally , wr stars are critical components in our quest to understand how star formation proceeds .",
    "for example , most of the previously known wrs are relatively isolated , but recent searches in the ir have found a plethora of these objects in stellar clusters near the galactic center ( e.g. figer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we employ four filters situated on prominent lines of he i ( 2.06 um ) , c iv ( 2.08 um ) , br @xmath1 ( 2.166 um ) , he ii ( 2.19 um ) , and three continuum filters covering wavelengths bluer and redder than each of the line filters ( 2.03 , 2.14 , and 2.248 um ) ( blum & damineli 1999 , homeier et al . 2000 ) . in this way",
    "we minimize the effects of differential reddening on the continuum of each individual star .",
    "each frame is analyzed with the set of routines collectively called the dophot package , a psf - fitting photometry package optimized for large images done in a pipeline process .",
    "dophot identifies , classifies , and performs photometry on objects in an image , making successive passes over the image to search each time for fainter objects .",
    "candidates are selected for spectroscopic follow - up based on relative line and continuum photometry and image subtraction with visual examination of the output ( homeier et al .",
    "2002 , in prep ) .",
    "in 1996 we began taking data at the 1.5 m at ctio , using the cerro tololo infrared imager ( cirim ) .",
    "this data comprises approximately 1.5 sq degrees of sky near the galactic center , half of which we have follow - up spectroscopic observations for . with this data",
    "we have discovered two new wr stars and two objects with surrounding nebular emission .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     both of the newly discovered wrs appear to be late - type wc stars ( wc7 - 8 ) .",
    "one is @xmath2  arcmin from the quintuplet cluster ( wr1 ) , or 20  pc projected distance .",
    "we speculate that it has been ejected from the quintuplet or is a former member of an as - yet undetected massive stellar cluster in the galactic center region .",
    "the second wr is part of the quintuplet ( wr2 , quintuplet source ) , and is located just outside the region examined by figer et al .",
    "spectra of these two objects are presented in figure 1 , and coordinates are listed in table 1 .",
    "finding charts will be published in an upcoming paper ( homeier et al .",
    "2002 , in prep ) .    of the two objects with nebular emission ,",
    "one is surrounded by a spherical nebula with strong h i lines , including br @xmath1 2.166 @xmath3 m , and he i 2.06 @xmath3 m emission .",
    "this object could be a pn , lbv , or a young o star ionizing the surrounding gas .",
    "it is located on the edge of a region with extremely large extinction , and there appears to be more nebular emission a few arcseconds to the south - east .",
    "we speculate that this is a star - forming region on the edge of a molecular cloud , and further observations are needed to deduce the distance of this region and whether it contains high - mass stars ."
