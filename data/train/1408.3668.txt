    "our models comprise four key components : ( i ) a time - dependent protoplanetary disk , ( ii ) planet growth by accretion of solids and gas , both under core - accretion and gravitational instability , ( iii ) planet migration , both within and without the disk , and ( iv ) chemical evolution of the planet .",

    "we further multiply this rate by an efficiency factor @xmath7 to allow for the possibility that material flows past the planet at a greater rate than implied by this prescription ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "the migration is therefore either very rapid relative to further growth ( i.e. effectively @xmath11 ) , or occurs after dispersal of the gas disk .",
    "most of the planet mass is therefore acquired in - situ , with some solids subsequently accreted after gravitational collapse to reach the final planet mass .",
