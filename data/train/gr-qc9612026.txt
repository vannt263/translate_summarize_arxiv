    "it is well known that the maximally extended reissner - nordstrm spacetime can be imagined as a collection of different asymptotically flat universes connected by different charged black holes @xcite . except for the schwarzschild solution",
    ", all the special solutions of the more general kerr - newman class of spacetimes can have two horizons , the inner and outer horizons .",
    "nevertheless gravitational theorists find that these dual - horizon black holes are unphysical because causality can be violated inside the hole @xcite .",
    "moreover any radiation ( either electromagnetic or gravitational in nature ) that goes into this kind of black hole will be indefinitely blue - shifted at the inner ( or cauchy ) horizon @xcite .",
    "this effect has caused some to expect that this null hypersurface acts like a barricade to the other universes in the maximally extended spacetime .",
    "this infinite blue - shift phenomenon at the cauchy horizon was first discussed by penrose in the late sixties @xcite . at that time",
    ", people believed that any small energy perturbation on these dual - horizon black holes would destroy the cauchy horizon because the perturbation is indefinitely magnified there , causing an infinite spacetime curvature at the horizon .",
    "thus the null hypersurface would become a spacelike curvature singularity and the gateway to other universes is sealed .",
    "both numerical and analytic approaches @xcite suggest that this null hypersurface is perturbatively unstable .",
    "however , although singularities are found at the cauchy horizon , they are not spacetime curvature singularities at all . by taking the diverging stress - energy tensor into account , hiscock showed that the perturbation only turns the horizon into a so - called _ whimper singularity _ : all curvature scalars are finite but a freely falling observer crossing the horizon measures an infinite energy density @xcite .",
    "this kind of singularity is too mild to seal off the passage to other universes , and so resolution of the issue would necessitate a study that did not rely on perturbation theory .",
    "poisson and israel made a breakthrough in this problem by showing that the cauchy horizon can turn into a scalar spacetime curvature singularity @xcite .",
    "unlike hiscock who considered a reissner - nordstrm black hole irradiated by a flux of incoming radiation , poisson and israel imposed both incoming and outgoing fluxes of radiation on a reissner - nordstrm background . the outgoing flux , even if negligibly small in quantity , makes the inner mass function of the black hole inflate without bound at the cauchy horizon .",
    "more precisely , the inner mass of the black hole diverges at a rate of @xmath4 near the cauchy horizon .",
    "the factor @xmath5 comes from the decay rate of the scattered radiation tail @xcite , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the cauchy horizon .",
    "regardless of the values of @xmath8 and the surface gravity @xmath9 , the mass parameter always grows although the exponential rate is attenuated by the decaying effect of the radiation tail .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ mass inflation _ and expected to seal the inner horizon because the diverging mass parameter induces a scalar curvature singularity at the horizon .",
    "this result implies that it is inappropriate to maximally extend any dual - horizon black holes beyond the cauchy horizon because the spacetime is unstable against energy perturbations there .",
    "it is generally believed that such perturbations ( in the form of gravitational radiation ) always exist in more realistic black holes which does not have perfect spherical or axial symmetry .",
    "these are scattered around the black hole forming incoming and outgoing fluxes but they will eventually decay away as a tail of late time radiation @xcite . in this way , mass inflation is expected to prevent violation of causality .",
    "in addition to the reissner - nordstrm black hole , the mass inflation phenomenon has been found to take place in other black hole configurations @xcite .",
    "these configurations are in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 dimensions as well as in asymptotically non - flat spacetimes .",
    "all of these calculations assumed the inverse power - law decay for late time radiation as an ansatz to obtain the inflating mass function near the cauchy horizon .",
    "since the mass parameter is attenuated by the decaying effect of the radiation tail , it is important to understand the behaviour of the radiative tail in a spacetime other than reissner - nordstrm class .",
    "mellor and moss have shown that the radiation from perturbations in a de sitter background exponentially decreases @xcite . strictly speaking this result has nothing to do with late time falloff because the global geometry extends beyond the cosmological horizon .",
    "however it indicates that the radiative falloff behaviour is sensitive to the presence of the cosmological constant .",
    "more recent work by ching _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that under certain circumstances the tail can be something other than the simple inverse power - law .    in this paper",
    "we will study radiative falloff in spacetimes that are not asymptotically flat .",
    "we find that the inverse power - law @xcite is not universally true , and that in some asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes , the late time tail decays exponentially .",
    "the asymptotically anti - de sitter backgrounds we will study are the @xmath0-dimensional black hole @xcite and schwarzschild - anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the structure of the @xmath13-dimensional scalar wave equation in spherically symmetric spacetimes that are not necessarily asymptotically flat , and discuss our numerical approach towards solving it . in section 3",
    "we verify that our numerical approach correctly reproduces the power - law falloff in asymptotically flat spacetimes , and we cross - check this analytically . in the next two sections we study the falloff behaviour in the @xmath0-dimensional ( or 3d ) black hole background and in @xmath1-dimensional schwarzschild - anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "concluding remarks and an appendix round out our work .",
    "we shall study scalar waves in different dimensions , since wave equations for higher - spin fields are of a qualitatively similar structure @xcite .",
    "the ( conformally coupled ) scalar wave equation in @xmath14 dimensions is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an arbitrary constant . if @xmath17 , this equation is conformally invariant .",
    "we simplify the problem by considering only static , spherically symmetric @xmath13-dimensional spacetimes with metric @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lapse function and @xmath20 is the metric of a @xmath21-dimensional unit sphere . generalizing zerilli s separability technique @xcite to @xmath22 dimensions , we assume @xmath23 the functions @xmath24 are the @xmath22-dimensional spherical harmonics which satisfy the equation @xmath25 the product @xmath26 is the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath27 which is the angular derivative operator . it is straightforward to show that equation ( [ we1 ] ) gives @xmath28 the function @xmath29 is defined as",
    "@xmath30 one can rewrite the wave equation ( [ we2 ] ) as @xmath31 with the help of a spatial differential operator @xmath32 alternatively , if we introduce @xmath33 then ( [ we2 ] ) can be written as @xmath34 or as @xmath35 using null co - ordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath38 ( defined as @xmath39 ) plays the role of a potential barrier which is induced from the background spacetime geometry . although the potential when written in terms of the tortoise co - ordinate @xmath40 can be very complicated , equation ( [ we5 ] ) has the familiar form of a potential scattering problem",
    ".    equation ( [ we5 ] ) can be integrated numerically in a straightforward fashion by using finite difference method .",
    "first of all the dalembert operator @xmath41 can be discretized as @xmath42 using taylor s theorem . in order to formulate a well - posed cauchy problem we need to include the initial conditions , which for simplicity we choose to be @xmath43 because the field @xmath44 is initially zero , its subsequent evolution is solely the result of the initial impulse of the field @xmath45 . discretizing the second condition in ( [ inicond ] ) yields @xmath46 where we employ a gaussian distribution with finite support for @xmath47 .",
    "we further define @xmath48 where the mesh size has to satisfy the condition @xmath49 so that the numerical rate of propagation of data is greater than its analytical counterpart .",
    "the discretization of the cauchy problem above then implies @xmath50 as a result , we can follow the evolution of the field @xmath44 starting from the initial data given at time @xmath51 .    in the case where the black hole geometry is asymptotically flat , the tortoise coordinate @xmath40 goes from negative infinity to positive infinity . therefore our cauchy problem is similar to the infinite string problem in which the initial data propagates towards left and right indefinitely .",
    "the initial data no longer enjoys this privilege when the background is asymptotically anti - de sitter because the tortoise coordinate goes from minus infinity to zero only . in other words",
    ", the right - propagating data can not travel in this direction forever .",
    "analogous to the semi - infinite vibrating string problem , boundary conditions at spatial infinity ( i.e. @xmath52 ) are needed in the asymptotically anti - de sitter background in order to formulate the problem appropriately .",
    "two types of boundary conditions that are widely used in anti - de sitter backgrounds are the dirichlet and neumann conditions @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the former reads @xmath53 whilst the latter is simply @xmath54 we shall consider employing both of these boundary conditions at spatial infinity for our numerical computations whenever the background geometry is asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "in this section we will review the behaviour of radiative falloff in asymptotically flat background spacetimes @xcite .",
    "we will present the results of the numerical calculation first .",
    "figure [ schwz1 ] shows a sample inverse power - decay of a scalar wave in the schwarzschild background spacetime of mass @xmath55 .",
    "we solve the wave equation ( [ we5 ] ) numerically using the scheme discussed in the previous section .",
    "the compact initial gaussian impulse is centered at a distance @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) and for simplicity we choose the @xmath58 spherical harmonic .",
    "figure [ schwz1 ] shows how the magnitude of the scalar field @xmath44 at a distance @xmath59 ( i.e. @xmath60 ) evolves . using linear regression , we find that the slope of the straight line on the graph is @xmath61 in agreement with the analytic prediction of an inverse power - law falloff with exponent @xmath62 @xcite",
    ".    figures [ schwz2 ] to [ schwz4 ] show the same potential barrier @xmath63 that is responsible for this falloff behaviour . figure [ schwz3 ] shows an exponential decrease of the left side of the potential function ; this is a result of the fact that the event horizon is located at @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "the power - law decrease on the right side of @xmath63 shown in figure [ schwz4 ] is a direct consequence of the use of an asymptotically flat background .",
    "if we compare figures [ schwz2 ] to [ schwz4 ] with figures [ sds1 ] to [ sds3 ] which represent the potential function in schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) spacetime , we find that the right side of @xmath63 has different decaying behaviour even the overall appearance of @xmath63 on the linear graph is very similar .",
    "it is this difference that distinguishes the falloff behaviour in the two backgrounds    now let us consider a scalar wave in an asymptotically flat @xmath13-dimensional background . for the remainder of this section we will restrict our attention to the case where the number of spatial dimensions @xmath22 is odd .",
    "the motivation for this may be traced back to huygen s principle , which implies that in even spatial dimensions the scalar wave obeying the equation @xmath65 always develops a tail , regardless of whether or not the asymptotically flat background is sourceless .",
    "consequently identification of the tail part of the wave that is due to solely to backscattering becomes quite problematic when @xmath22 is even .",
    "inspired by the work of ching et .",
    "@xcite , we consider a spherically symmetric static metric of the form ( [ metricform ] ) with lapse function @xmath66 the constants @xmath67 and @xmath68 are integers , where @xmath69 but @xmath70 .",
    "the other constant @xmath71 is a real number .",
    "when we have @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , this becomes a schwarzschild background of mass @xmath75 .",
    "once we have the lapse function , we can compute the potential function @xmath76 from ( [ ve ] ) .",
    "we first find the static solution @xmath77 of wave equation ( [ we2 ] ) , by obtaining the solution of the equation @xmath78 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath77 has the following form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "notice that @xmath81 is an integer when the spatial dimension @xmath22 is odd .",
    "except when @xmath82 this integer is always positive .",
    "hence it is the first sum of the solution that is physically relevant since it vanishes for large @xmath83 , and we choose this as the static solution . for the remainder of this section , we assume that @xmath84 so that this choice of @xmath77 is valid . the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 are arbitrary constants but the other coefficients are all polynomial in @xmath87 .",
    "the generating equations for @xmath88 and @xmath89 are given in appendix [ d+1apdx ] .",
    "we follow the approach in refs . @xcite and let @xmath90 be the form of the initial wave , i.e. the wave emitted by a star at the onset of gravitational collapse . in other words",
    ", this is the time when @xmath91 .",
    "the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are as yet unknown .",
    "the term @xmath94 represents @xmath95 integrations of the function @xmath92 with respect to @xmath96 ; similarly for @xmath97 . using ( [ initialform ] ) ,",
    "equation ( [ we4 ] ) becomes @xmath98 this equation has a set of solutions @xmath99 where we have set @xmath100 constant @xmath101 without loss of generality .",
    "the pair of equations above allow us to generate @xmath102 hierarchically in a straightforward manner .",
    "we can split each @xmath102 into two parts , denoted by @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath103 is defined as the @xmath71-independent portion of @xmath102 , while @xmath104 is the rest which is @xmath71-dependent .",
    "physically , the part @xmath103 represents the wave on the lightcone because it is the part that would be generated if the background were flat ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "price referred to this part as the primary wave which depends only on the mode of the spherical harmonics .",
    "the other part @xmath104 is called the tail of the wave because it is created by the presence of the spacetime curvature and is off the lightcone due to scattering",
    ". given equations ( [ b0 ] ) and ( [ bi ] ) , one can show that the primary part of @xmath102 is simply @xmath106 when @xmath22 is odd , @xmath81 is an integer and the sequence @xmath107 truncates .",
    "however if @xmath22 is even , the sequence does not terminate and the primary part of the initial wave @xmath108 has infinitely many terms .",
    "indeed when this is the case , it is inappropriate to call @xmath103 the primary part because there are tails present .",
    "the approach breaks down because the primary and tail parts of the wave become indistinguishable .",
    "this is the reason we restrict ourselves to odd @xmath22 in this section as mentioned earlier .",
    "let us now consider the tail part of @xmath102 . unlike the primary part , @xmath104 has no simple solution .",
    "fortunately one can always generate @xmath102 recursively . note that @xmath104 is of order @xmath109 .    since @xmath81 is an integer in odd spatial dimensions , it is convenient to define the functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath112 such that the initial wave can be expressed as @xmath113 where @xmath114 when the background is flat ( @xmath105 ) , only the first @xmath115 terms of @xmath103 survive .",
    "we expect that any outgoing radiation will propagate to spatial infinity without any scattering in a flat background .",
    "therefore we must have @xmath116 because @xmath111 represents the scattered infalling radiation and the @xmath103 are non - zero only for @xmath117 . in other words , we insist that @xmath118 .    for concreteness , we suppose the scalar wave starts leaving the star at retarded time @xmath119 ; that is to say the scalar field is zero before @xmath119 .",
    "continuity then implies @xmath120 we also assume that there is essentially no emission from the star after @xmath121 ( due to gravitational red shift ) . when the star possesses no initial static moment at the onset of collapse , this cutoff condition is translated into @xmath122 because only the terms @xmath110 to @xmath123 which represent the primary wave correspond to the emission from the star .",
    "this condition implies @xmath124 therefore if there is no static moment before @xmath125 , the scalar wave after time @xmath126 is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is only a constant and @xmath129 is of order @xmath109 .",
    "so the first term of this solution which is time - independent is of order @xmath130 .",
    "physically , this says the tail of the perturbation persists after the time @xmath126 .",
    "the primary part of the wave has been `` washed out '' by the gravitational red shift before @xmath126 .",
    "the situation is more complicated if the star carries a static moment at the onset of the collapse because the static wave @xmath77 can also be divided into primary and tail parts . in this case , we superimpose @xmath77 of ( [ dstatic ] ) and @xmath131 of ( [ initialform ] ) together to form a new initial scalar wave .",
    "we also suppose that only the tail of the perturbation persists after the retarded time @xmath126 @xcite . for the superimposed initial wave this cutoff condition requires @xmath132 which yields @xmath133 the restriction on @xmath110 above ensures that the primary part of ( [ initialform ] ) can be cancelled by the @xmath71-independent part of ( [ dstatic ] ) properly after the time @xmath134 , leaving the combined @xmath108 to be @xmath71-dependent only after @xmath134 . as a result",
    ", the wave with initial static moment will become @xmath135 one can show that the first sum in the equation above is of order @xmath136 because the coefficient function @xmath137 is a polynomial in @xmath87 with degree @xmath68 . in the second sum ,",
    "the term @xmath138 is a constant which equals to @xmath110 , and @xmath139 is of order @xmath136 .",
    "therefore instead of having a time independent part of order @xmath130 , the wave with initial static moment has an order @xmath136 only .",
    "now we turn our attention to the scalar wave at late time . by late time , we mean @xmath140 .",
    "for the late time wave @xmath141 , we introduce another ansatz @xmath142 by substituting @xmath143 , equation ( [ we4 ] ) becomes @xmath144 this equation has another set of solutions @xmath145 unlike the case for the initial wave @xmath108 , ( for which the functions @xmath102 can be calculated recursively using straightforward differentiation and integration ) , recursive generation of the functions @xmath146 involve inverting the differential operator @xmath147 .",
    "the zero order equation has a solution @xmath148 the coefficient functions @xmath89 are those in equations ( [ dstatic ] ) .",

    "the coefficients @xmath153 are also given in appendix [ d+1apdx ] . since each coefficient @xmath154 is a constant instead of a polynomial in @xmath87 , we can estimate the order of the late time wave @xmath141 as @xmath155    finally we match the late time solution to the initial solution at some transient period where @xmath96 , @xmath156 and @xmath83 are of the same order . as",
    "the background is asymptotically flat , the tortoise coordinate @xmath40 must have an order similar to that of @xmath83 in this transient region .",
    "that is to say the orders of @xmath83 and @xmath157 are the same .",
    "the initial wave @xmath158 in this period becomes @xmath159 in order to have consistent orders in the transient period , we must have @xmath160 if the star has no initial static moment ; whilst the order of @xmath161 must be @xmath162 if the star has a static moment at the onset of collapse .",
    "in other words equations ( [ rate1 ] ) and ( [ rate2 ] ) give the falloff behaviour of the wave at late time .",
    "the inverse power falloff behaviour modified by a logarithmic term was first noted by ching _",
    "_ @xcite . for a schwarzschild background ,",
    "we set @xmath74 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 and have @xmath163 , yielding the familiar power - law decay rate @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional black hole spacetime obtained by banados teitelboim and zanelli @xcite is a spacetime which satisfies the vacuum einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "its metric is @xmath165 and is actually anti - de sitter spacetime with identifications .",
    "the constant @xmath166 is the quasi - local mass of the black hole and @xmath167 is the angular momentum of the hole @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we shall regard the above metric as a spacetime which is asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "when @xmath168 , the wave equation ( [ we1 ] ) gives ( [ we5 ] ) with @xmath169 in this case , the tortoise coordinate @xmath40 is given by @xmath170 as @xmath83 goes from @xmath171 to infinity , the tortoise coordinate has a range @xmath172 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath83 in terms of @xmath40 as @xmath173 for conformal wave in @xmath11 dimensions , the parameter @xmath16 equals @xmath174 and the potential barrier @xmath175 becomes @xmath176 where , for convenience , we have defined @xmath177    the procedure for finding a solution to the conformal scalar wave equation is as follows .",
    "we first write down the representation of the solution @xmath44 in terms of green s functions .",
    "the rest of the problem then reduces to that of looking for the correct green s function .",
    "we will fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency domain and obtain the green s function in frequency space .",

    "the results of the previous subsection are based upon the use of the potential barrier @xmath240 which is an approximation to @xmath241 since @xmath242 but @xmath243 , @xmath244 is always less than one .",
    "therefore @xmath63 has a converging series expansion @xmath245 as a result we may iteratively solve the wave equation , treating @xmath246 as the lowest order term , @xmath247 as the first correction to this approximation , and so on .    for clarity , we define @xmath248 therefore the equation @xmath249 has a representation @xmath250 at @xmath64 . the functions @xmath251 and @xmath252 satisfy the equation @xmath253 .",
    "the other function @xmath254 satisfies the same equation as @xmath251 and @xmath252 and also satisfies the boundary conditions at @xmath201 . in other words",
    ", @xmath254 is the solution ( [ btzf0 ] ) in our case .",
    "similarly the solution around @xmath52 is @xmath255 where @xmath256 is just ( [ btzg0 ] ) .",
    "we first compute the wronskian @xmath194 for @xmath195 and @xmath196 above . since this wronskian is @xmath40-independent , the simplest way to compute it is to evaluate the quantity at the point @xmath52 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath257 since @xmath196 and @xmath195 satisfy a differential equation which differs from that satisfied by @xmath256 and @xmath254 , the wronskians @xmath258 and @xmath259 are functions of @xmath40 in general .",
    "therefore the correction @xmath260 in the potential barrier induces an extra ( @xmath40-independent ) term in the wronskian @xmath194 .",
    "the first born approximations for @xmath195 and @xmath196 read @xmath261 and @xmath262 if we choose @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "the functions @xmath265 and @xmath266 are defined via the equations @xmath267 as a result , the wronskian @xmath194 can be approximated by @xmath268 this wronskian has roots on the lower half @xmath220-plane .",
    "thus there is quasi - normal ringing effect in the wave tail in this 3d black hole configuration with the approximate potential function @xmath269 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath270 and @xmath271 have no cut , the falloff rate of the conformal wave is also exponential .",
    "the shape of the exact potential function @xmath63 is given on figure [ btz1 ] with parameters @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "figures [ btz2 ] and [ btz3 ] are results of the numerical calculations using the exact 3d black hole potential ( [ btzpotential ] ) .",
    "the methodology underlying these computations is identical to the previous case that uses the approximate exponential potential function .",
    "the parameters and boundary conditions used in this case are also the same as the cases in figures [ p_btz1 ] and [ p_btz2 ] .",
    "once again the numerical calculations show the exponential falloff of the scalar wave in the static 3d background .      when @xmath274 , i.e. the black hole rotates , we also find a late time exponential decay rate , as we shall now demonstrate .",
    "if we assume that @xmath275 that is to say there is no  spherical harmonic \" component to the wave , the conformal scalar wave equation @xmath276 will reduce to ( [ we5 ] ) .",
    "the tortoise coordinate @xmath40 is defined as before but the potential barrier becomes @xmath277    in this spinning case , the black hole has two horizons @xmath278 which are given by the equation @xmath279 the lapse function @xmath19 can then be written in terms of @xmath280 and @xmath281 as @xmath282 as a result , the tortoise coordinate reads @xmath283 which has an inverse of the form @xmath284 the coefficients @xmath285 which read @xmath286 are of order @xmath287 . if @xmath288 is small enough , we can employ the approximation @xmath289 if we substitute this approximation into the potential barrier @xmath63 , we will obtain @xmath290 it is obvious that the first approximation of this potential has a form @xmath291 while the second one is @xmath292 . according to our previous analysis , we may conclude that the decay rate at late time is also exponential rather than a power - law .",
    "figure [ sbtz1 ] is the graph of the potential functions of this spinning case with zero angular harmonic .",
    "one can show that when the ratio @xmath293 , @xmath294 becomes negative for some @xmath295 .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in figure [ sbtz1 ] , where @xmath63 becomes negative when @xmath296 is sufficiently large . in figure",
    "[ sbtz2 ] , we can see that the potential functions in both cases vanish at an exponential rate towards the event horizon . as usual",
    ", we put a gaussian impulse at a distance twice of the outer horizon @xmath280 and the numerical response of the scalar waves over time at a distance @xmath297 is shown in figure [ sbtz3 ] .",
    "this figure shows an exponential decay of the wave although its appearance differs from the previous graphs because there are no angular harmonics ( i.e. @xmath298 ) .",
    "indeed if we set @xmath298 in the static 3d black hole case , we find that the falloff also looks like that in figure [ sbtz3 ] because the pole that is closest to the real @xmath220-axis for the green s function in frequency domain has no real part .",
    "since the 3d black hole spacetime is asymptotically anti - de sitter , one might expect that the late time falloff behaviour of any scalar wave in schwarzschild - anti - de sitter ( sads ) background has similar behaviour .",
    "in fact , the situation is quite different from the 3d case , in part because of the different dimensionality and in part because it is not possible to solve the wave equation ( [ we5 ] ) exactly in this background .",
    "although the potential function @xmath29 in this case reads @xmath299 which is quite similar to ( [ btzve ] ) in the 3d case , we can not write @xmath83 as a function of @xmath40 in a closed form .",
    "that is to say given the lapse function @xmath300 where @xmath164 and the black hole radius @xmath301 satisfies the equation @xmath302 , the tortoise coordinate @xmath303 has no closed form inverse , and so we are unable to write down an explicit expression for the potential @xmath63 .    for the remainder of this section we set @xmath304 ( i.e. we consider a conformal scalar field propagating on an sads background ) .",
    "the most important difference between the 3d black hole background and sads background is the shape of the potential function @xmath63 . in both cases",
    "the potential functions are decreasing in an exponential manner toward the horizon . in the 3d case ( either spinning or static )",
    "this function attains a maximum at a distance @xmath233 ( @xmath52 ) . when the background is sads , this is no longer true because spatial infinity ( which is still given by @xmath305 ) is not the place at which @xmath63 has an absolute maximum ( for @xmath306 ) . as with the schwarzschild black hole ( figure [ schwz2 ] ) ,",
    "the potential function @xmath63 attains a maximum not far away from the event horizon . in the sads case",
    ", the shape of the potential function @xmath63 is given in figure [ sads1 ] .",
    "unlike the schwarzschild case , the tortoise coordinate @xmath40 for the sads background is bounded above .",
    "eventually all the outgoing waves that leave the black hole region will return towards it due to the boundary condition at @xmath52 .",
    "the returning wave will then reflect off of the potential barrier back toward spatial infinity .",
    "this is completely different behaviour from the 3d case , in which the incoming wave from spatial infinity @xmath52 continues its journey to the black hole unhindered .",
    "we can see from figure [ sads1 ] that when @xmath307 is small ( barriers ( a)(c ) ) , the barrier maximum moves to the left , lengthening the travelling time from this maximum to spatial infinity .",
    "when @xmath308 vanishes ( case ( c ) and ( c ) ) , @xmath309 because @xmath310 in general . therefore barriers ( a ) and ( b ) have @xmath311 although this feature is not apparent on the graph due to the small size of @xmath307 .",
    "the barrier height is considerably higher than the magnitude of @xmath63 at @xmath52 , and this feature becomes more pronounced for large @xmath308 .",
    "this causes the scalar wave to bounce back and forth in the region outside the barrier .",
    "however part of the scalar wave can surmount the barrier ( thereby going into the black hole ) because the barrier height is still finite .",
    "however it takes a long time for a significant portion of the wave to enter the black hole .",
    "we solve the wave equation in this sads background numerically .",
    "the results of the numerical integration of equation ( [ we5 ] ) using ( [ sadsve ] ) and ( [ sadsmetric ] ) are given in the next few graphs .",
    "figures [ sads2 ] and [ sads3 ] show the falloff behaviour of a conformal scalar wave with @xmath298 initially located at a distance @xmath312 .",
    "the computation for figure [ sads2 ] uses the dirichlet condition at @xmath52 but neumann boundary condition is employed for figure [ sads3 ] .",
    "since the cosmological constant @xmath307 was chosen to be relatively small in both cases , namely @xmath313 , we can see on both graphs that there is clearly an inverse power - decay behaviour . according to the graph ,",
    "this power - decay rate is roughly @xmath314 which agrees with the one in schwarzschild case .",
    "however this inverse power - decay does not last very long after the return of the outgoing wave from spatial infinity .",
    "both diagrams show this returning wavefront .    for small @xmath307 and nonzero @xmath308",
    ", the falloff behaviour resembles the case of @xmath298 .",
    "initially there is a ringing effect ( due to the quasi - normal modes ) followed by inverse power - decay behaviour as shown in figures [ sads4 ] and [ sads5 ] .",
    "since the finite height of the potential maximum allows the scalar wave to surmount the barrier and leave the trapped region which is the exterior outside the barrier maximum , we expect that the peak value of the second returning wave is smaller than that of the first wave .",
    "however it is unclear from simple inspection of figures [ sads2 ] to [ sads5 ] whether or not this is the case",
    ". figures [ sads6 ] to [ sads9 ] are the numerical results we obtained using the potential functions ( a ) and ( c ) in figure [ sads1 ] .",
    "we compute the large @xmath307 case with both dirichlet ( figures [ sads6 ] and [ sads8 ] ) and neumann ( [ sads7 ] and [ sads9 ] ) boundary conditions . for this case",
    "there are more returning waves in a reasonable amount of cpu time .",
    "from these graphs , we can see that the scalar wave does indeed decrease but over a much larger time scale .",
    "figures [ sads6 ] and [ sads7 ] indicate that the peak - height has an approximate exponential falloff for @xmath315 . for @xmath316 ,",
    "the peak - height has a more complicated behaviour illustrated in figures [ sads8 ] and [ sads9 ] . over long time scales the maximum peak - height has a very mild approximate exponential falloff .",
    "the results of this work indicate clearly that the asymptotics of a given spacetime have a considerable influence on the late time falloff behaviour of a scalar wave .",
    "the early work of price showing that waves in schwarzschild background decay away according to an inverse power rate was recently extended by ching _",
    "et al . _ who found that the inverse power - law can also be modified by a logarithmic term in some black hole configurations .",
    "we have been concerned in this paper with the falloff behaviour of conformal scalar waves in a background geometry which is asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "we found that the waves in uncharged static and spinning 3d black hole backgrounds die out at an exponential rate .",
    "this conclusion is supported by both analytical and numerical computation . for conformal scalar waves in a schwarzschild - anti - de sitter background",
    "our numerical analysis demonstrates that the falloff pattern over short time scales obeys ( after some ringing ) a power - law falloff .",
    "however over longer time scales the outgoing wave returns from spatial infinity .",
    "the falloff of the peak amplitude in this case is neither inverse power nor exponential .",
    "however there is a very weak exponential decrease in the maximal peak amplitude .",
    "this decay pattern is so complicated that further investigation will be needed to more precisely determine its dependence on @xmath157 .",
    "previous investigations of mass inflation in a charged spinless 3d black hole @xcite and an uncharged spinning 3d black hole @xcite assumed a power - law falloff rate for the scalar wave . under such assumptions these investigations demonstrated that mass inflation occurred in the corresponding geometries .",
    "we have shown here that the assumption of power - law falloff in the uncharged static and spinning 3d black hole background is not valid and must be replaced by an exponential falloff .    for a rotating 3d black hole",
    "we have shown that a @xmath317-independent scalar field also has late time exponential decay . in this particular setup",
    ", one can recalculate the mass inflation rate using the correct late time falloff rate .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the new inflation rate reads @xmath318 , where @xmath319 is the surface gravity at the cauchy horizon of the black hole .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 comes from the exponential falloff rate for the scalar wave ( which reads @xmath320 ) and is determined ( say in the @xmath168 case ) by setting @xmath236 for the relevant @xmath227 and finding ( numerically ) the value of @xmath211 with the maximum negative real part .",
    "for example when @xmath321 , @xmath322 and @xmath323 , the surface gravity at the cauchy horizon is @xmath324 but the parameter @xmath67 is only @xmath325 according to figure [ sbtz3 ] .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows some other values of @xmath67 and @xmath319 in the rotating 3d black hole backgrounds .",
    "all these cases are consistent to the claim that the surface gravity @xmath319 is always greater than the exponential falloff rate @xmath67 .",
    "therefore the attenuation from the falloff effect does not halt mass inflation and the basic conclusions in @xcite remain unchanged .",
    "rather the mass inflation rate is slowed down relative to spacetimes with power - law falloff .",
    "we have numerically determined that @xmath67 is an increasing function of @xmath308 .",
    "recall that for the approximate potential @xmath63 in ( [ vapprox ] ) , the dominant decay rate of the green s function is determined by the root @xmath326 of the equation @xmath238 in the lower half @xmath220-plane that is closest to the real axis . since @xmath327",
    ", this root clearly depends upon @xmath308 .",
    "we have computed this dependence and summarized the results in table  [ table2 ]   in table [ table2 ] are far from precise .",
    "with only ten significant figures for @xmath328 , the values of @xmath329 for @xmath330 and @xmath331 are of order @xmath332 and @xmath333 respectively .",
    "this is the way the modified bessel function behaves for large @xmath227 . in the other cases , the corresponding values of @xmath329",
    "are of order at most @xmath334 .",
    "indeed one will need more than 25 significant figures in order to bring @xmath335 to the order @xmath336 .",
    "] , where @xmath337 .",
    "as @xmath308 increases ( i.e. @xmath227 increases ) , the real part of @xmath338 also increases , yielding a more rapid falloff rate .",
    "this leads to a qualitative distinction between the mass inflation mechanism in the ( static ) @xmath0 and @xmath1-dimensional spacetimes . in a schwarzschild background ,",
    "the falloff rate is @xmath339 @xcite which implies larger the moment @xmath308 , faster the falloff .",
    "this yields a mass inflation rate @xmath340 @xcite ; the exponential growth always surpasses the falloff effect for arbitrarily large @xmath308 . for a 3d black hole with an inner horizon",
    "our results imply a falloff rate @xmath341 .",
    "therefore it is not difficult to imagine a situation in which @xmath308 is so large that the magnitude of the imaginary part of @xmath342 yields an @xmath67 which exceeds the surface gravity @xmath319 which is independent of @xmath308 at the cauchy horizon , cutting off mass inflation for those modes .",
    "this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "given the lapse function ( [ dlapse ] ) in @xmath13-dimensional spacetime , the time - independent solution of @xmath343 is given by equation ( [ dstatic ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath89 can be generated by the next two equations : @xmath344 the function @xmath345 used above is defined as @xmath346 where @xmath347 is a real number and @xmath348 is an integrable function .",
    "we evaluate the integral in @xmath345 in such a way that the integration constant is always set to zero .",
    "this function has a property that if @xmath348 is a constant and @xmath349 , then @xmath350 gives a constant .",
    "when @xmath347 is unity but @xmath348 is still a constant , @xmath350 is proportional to @xmath351 , where @xmath352 is some constant of dimension of length . in the case when @xmath348 is no longer constant but a polynomial of @xmath351 , the function @xmath345 gives another polynomial of @xmath351 .",
    "the index @xmath353 in the two equations runs from zero to infinity and the starting coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 are two arbitrary constants .",
    "it is obvious that when the background is flat , i.e. @xmath105 , all the @xmath88 and @xmath89 vanish except @xmath354 and @xmath355 . if @xmath356 , these coefficients are polynomials in @xmath351 .",
