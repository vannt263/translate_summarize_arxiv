    "the first problems in optimal stopping appeared in the framework of statistics , more precisely , in the context of sequential analysis ( see the book by wald @xcite ) . for continuous time",
    "processes a relevant reference is the book of shiryaev @xcite that also has applications to statistics . a new impulse to these problems is related to mathematical finance , where arbitrage considerations give that in order to price an american option one has to solve an optimal stopping problem .",
    "the first results in this direction were provided by mc kean @xcite in 1965 and merton @xcite in 1973 , who respectively solved the perpetual put and call option pricing problem , by solving the corresponding optimal stopping problems in the context of the black and scholes model @xcite . for the state of the art in the subject see the book by peskir and shiryaev @xcite and the references therein .",
    "a new approach for solving one - dimensional optimal stopping problems for very general reward functions is provided in the recent paper @xcite .    when considering optimal stopping problems we typically find two classes of results .",
    "the first one consists in the explicit solution to a concrete optimal stopping problem .",
    "usually in this case one has to somehow guess the solution and prove that this guess in fact solves the optimization problem ; we call this approach `` verification ''",
    ". for example we can consider the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second class consists of general results , for wide classes of processes and reward functions .",
    "we call this the `` theoretical '' approach .",
    "it typically include results about properties of the solution . in this class",
    "we mention for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but these two classes not always meet , as frequently in concrete problems the assumptions of the theoretical studies are not fulfilled , and , what is more important , many of these theoretical studies do not provide concrete ways to find solutions . in what concerns the first approach ,",
    "a usual procedure is to apply the _ principle of smooth fit _ , that generally leads to the solution of two equations : the _ continuous fit _ equation and the _ smooth fit _ equation .",
    "once these equations are solved , a verification procedure is needed in order to prove that the candidate is the effective solution of the problem ( see chapter iv in @xcite ) .",
    "this approach , when an explicit solution can be found , is very effective . in what concerns the second approach ,",
    "maybe the most important result is dynkin s characterization of the solution of the value function @xmath14 as the least @xmath18-excessive ( or @xmath18-superharmonic ) majorant of the payoff function @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "other ways of classifying approaches in order to study optimal stopping problems include the martingale - markovian dichotomy as exposed in @xcite .    in the present work we provide an explicit solution of a _ right - sided _ optimal stopping problem for a one - dimensional diffusion process , i.e. , when the optimal stopping time has the form @xmath20 for some optimal threshold @xmath21 , under mild regularity conditions .",
    "right - sided problems are also known as _ call - type _ optimal stopping problems .",
    "analogous results are valid for left - sided problems",
    ".    an important byproduct of our results has to do with the smooth fit principle .",
    "our results are independent of this principle , but they give sufficient conditions in order to guarantee it .",
    "in section [ section : definitions ] some necessary definitions and preliminary results are given .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ section : main ] . in section [ section : sf ] we discuss the consequences of our results related to the smooth fit principle .",
