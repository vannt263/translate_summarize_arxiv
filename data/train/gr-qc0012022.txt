    "various interactions of black holes with scalar fields have been extensively studied for a long time .",
    "though previous works have been mainly concerned with the evolution of a massless scalar field , the analysis of massive ones will be also physically important .",
    "for example , in higher - dimensional theories , the fourier modes of a massless scalar field behave like massive fields known as kaluza - klein modes , and the recent development of the kaluza - klein idea ( e.g. , the randall - sundrum model @xcite in string theory ) strongly motivates us to understand the evolutional features due to the field mass in detail .",
    "massive scalar fields in black hole spacetimes can cause interesting phenomena which are qualitatively different from massless case .",
    "the remarkable example is the vacuum polarization @xmath1 of a quantum massive scalar field @xmath2 , which is in thermal equilibrium with a nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite . because the black - hole temperature is very low , the mass - induced excitation of @xmath1 results in the resonant amplification at @xmath3 for the field mass @xmath4 and the black - hole mass @xmath5 .",
    "such a resonance behavior due to the mass of a field interacting with a black hole may appear in various processes as a basic feature of black - hole geometry . for a step to support this conjecture , in this paper ,",
    "we turn our attention to a problem on time evolution of classical fields .",
    "the evolution of a massive scalar field in schwarzschild background was first analyzed by starobinskii and novikov , using the complex plane approach @xcite , and they found that because of the mass term , there are poles in the complex plane closer to the real axis than in the massless case , which lead to inverse power law behavior with smaller indices than massless case .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that the late - time tails of massive scalar fields in reissner - nordstrm spacetime are quite different from massless fields in the existence of the intermediate late time tails @xcite . if the field mass @xmath4 is small , namely @xmath6 , the oscillatory inverse power - law behavior @xmath7 dominates as the intermediate late - time tails . note that massless fields decay more rapidly without any oscillation , as was first studied by price @xcite .",
    "the analytical approximation ( [ eq : hp ] ) was derived from the flat - spacetime approximation , where the effects of spacetime curvature are neglected .",
    "though the behavior ( [ eq : hp ] ) was numerically verified at intermediate late times , hod and piran @xcite also suggested that another wave pattern dominates at very late times , namely the intermediate tails ( [ eq : hp ] ) are not a final asymptotic behaviors , and mentioned that `` fields decay at late times slower than any power law '' .",
    "though similar numerical results in the schwarzschild case were reported by burko @xcite , the evolution of massive scalar fields at asymptotic late times has been claimed to be inverse power - law behavior .",
    "our purpose of this paper is to clarify what kind of mass - induced behaviors dominates in the asymptotic late - time tails as a result of interaction of massive scalar fields with a black hole . in sec .",
    "[ sec : green s ] we introduce the black - hole green s function using the spectral decomposition method @xcite .",

    "[ sec : analysis ] we consider a nearly extreme reissner - nordstrm background , motivated by the fact that the resonance phenomena in the vacuum polarization of quantum scalar fields become clear .",
    "then , based on the procedure of asymptotic matching , we construct approximate solutions in the nearly extreme limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : intermediate ] we study the intermediate tail which appears in the case of small mass field , confirming our result in comparison with ( [ eq : hp ] ) . in sec .",

    "scalar waves are mixed states with multiple phases backscattered by spacetime curvature , and most of these waves are canceled out each other by those of the inverse phase .",

    "this behaviors of inverse power - law decay supports the numerical results in @xcite .",
    "late - time tail behaviors are generally caused by the domination of the backscattering from far regions .",
    "it is found the asymptotic tail of massive scalar fields ( [ eq : massivetail ] ) appears when the effective contribution to the integral ( [ eq : branch - cut2 ] ) arises from the region ( [ rela : asymptotic ] ) , namely , when the backscattering due to spacetime curvature dominates .",
    "further , the frequencies of waves which contribute to the backscattering are sharply peaked about @xmath146 .",
    "these facts suggest that the asymptotic @xmath0 tail is caused by a _ resonance _ backscattering due to spacetime curvature .",
    "we can also clarify the resonant picture from a viewpoint of the timescale when the @xmath0 tail dominates .",
    "the basic condition for the tail dominance is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : late - time ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath6 , the @xmath0 tail requires the additional condition ( [ rela : asymptotic ] ) , which gives @xmath157 . on the other hand , for large field mass @xmath158 ,",
    "the larger @xmath116 is , the later the @xmath0 tail begins to dominate , because the tail requires the further condition @xmath159 for eq .",
    "( [ saddlepoint ] ) in addition to the conditions ( [ eq : late - time ] ) and ( [ rela : asymptotic ] ) , which gives @xmath160 .",
    "therefore the timescale when the @xmath0 tail dominates will become minimum at @xmath3 , which means that the most effective backscattering occurs for such massive scalar fields at late times . here",
    "we note that the timescale when the @xmath0 tail dominates is determined by the black - hole radius @xmath5 .",
    "it is conjectured that the slow decay of @xmath0 originates from the existence of resonant enhancement of massive scalar waves with the peculiar frequency @xmath146 near the horizon . in conclusion",
    ", we claim that resonance behaviors in field - mass dependence are not peculiar to quantum scalar fields but manifest also in classical scalar fields .",
