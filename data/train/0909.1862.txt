    "the nonlinearities in a system can be studied using a number of optical methods . among these ,",
    "stokes and anti - stokes processes , and more generally four - wave - mixing processes are quite common tools used to understand the nonlinear nature of the system  @xcite . with this in view",
    "we study the stimulated stokes and anti - stokes processes in cavity optomechanics .",
    "as is well known , the nonlinearity in cavity optomechanics arises from the radiation pressure  @xcite on the moving mirror of the cavity .",
    "thus , if the cavity is driven by a pump field of frequency @xmath0 and a stokes field of frequency @xmath1 , then , due to radiation pressure , the output of the cavity would consist of fields at the applied frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 and a generated frequency @xmath2 . while some previous works  @xcite have explored the stokes and anti - stokes processes in the context of parametric oscillation instability , here we show how such processes can be conveniently used to study the phenomena of normal - mode splitting  @xcite arising from the strong coupling between the cavity and the mechanical mirror .",
    "further , the system can act as an amplifier for the stokes field . needless to say , we work in a domain which is below the instability threshold .",
    "moreover , very interesting photon correlations between the stokes and the anti - stokes photons have been reported in atomic vapors under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "here we also discuss the correlations between the photons created spontaneously by the optomechanical system .",
    "the correlations are found to be nonclassical .",

    "iii , we calculate the output fields and thus obtain nonlinear susceptibilities for stokes and anti - stokes processes . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that the stokes field is amplified , and find very prominent normal - mode splittings in the output fields . thus , stimulated stokes and anti - stokes processes provide us with a new tool for studying the strong coupling regime of optomechanics .",
    "we find that normal - mode splittings are especially pronounced in the two quadratures of the output fields . in sec .",
    "v , we analyze the correlations between the spontaneously generated photons in the four - wave - mixing processes in the optomechanical system . we show that such correlations are intrinsically quantum .",

    "the quantity @xmath76 is the gain of the cavity optomechanical four - wave mixer . in figs .",
    "[ fig4]  [ fig6 ] , we have plotted @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath76 , respectively , versus the normalized frequency @xmath77 for different pump powers",
    ". the quadrature @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) exhibits absorptive ( dispersive ) behavior .",

    "the peak positions are in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the case when the input pump power is such that normal - mode splitting occurs .",
    "the behavior of net gain as a function of @xmath1 is different due to the combination of absorptive and dispersive characteristics of the quadratures @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the gain shows normal - mode splitting for larger value of the pump power .",
    "moreover , the maximum gain of the stokes field is about 1.15",
    ". it should be borne in mind that the quadratures @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be obtained by homodyne measurement .",
    "likewise , the output power at the anti - stokes frequency @xmath2 in terms of the input stokes power is given by @xmath78 for brevity , we only show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the function @xmath79 against the normalized frequency @xmath77 for several values of the pump power . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , increasing the pump power can make the signal of four - wave mixing evolve from one peak to double peaks .",
    "it is also seen that the maximum value of @xmath79 is about 0.15 and the output power at the anti - stokes frequency @xmath80 is much less than the output power of the stokes field .",
    "however , for larger pump powers , the maximum gain for stokes and anti - stokes fields are bigger .",
    "for example , for 40 mw pump power , the maximum of @xmath76 and @xmath79 are about 1.5 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "so far we have considered stimulated processes .",
    "the stokes and anti - stokes fields are also generated spontaneously . in this case",
    "we have to include input vacuum fields .",
    "these vacuum fields would be broad band .",
    "thus the field at frequency @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is to be replaced by a broad band quantum field @xmath81 with zero mean value and with correlations @xmath82 .",
    "the calculations of the output quantum fields are standard @xcite .",
    "we have used these and introduced the langevin force @xmath83 which stems from the coupling of the movable mirror to the thermal environment having zero mean value with correlations @xcite @xmath84d\\omega , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath86 is the temperature of the environment .",
    "the fluctuations of the output fields are obtained as @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the fourier transform of the langevin force @xmath83 and the input vacuum fields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , and where @xmath93c_{0},\\\\ e(\\omega)=\\displaystyle\\frac{2\\kappa}{d(\\omega)}\\{-2\\omega_{m}^{3}\\chi^{2}i|c_{0}|^{2}+(\\omega^{2}-\\omega_{m}^{2}+i\\gamma_{m}\\omega)\\vspace{.1in}\\\\ \\hspace{.5in}\\times[\\kappa - i(\\omega+\\delta)]\\}-1,\\vspace{0.1in}\\\\ f(\\omega)=\\displaystyle-\\frac{4\\kappa\\omega_{m}^{3}\\chi^{2}c_{0}^2}{d(\\omega)}i . \\end{array}\\ ] ] in which @xmath94 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) , the first term containing @xmath88 is the contribution of the langevin force acting on the movable mirror , while the other two terms come from the input vacuum fields .",
    "so the fluctuations of the output fields depend on the langevin force and the input vacuum fields .",
    "further , we define time dependent @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath95 represents the positive - frequency part of the fluctuations of the output fields , corresponding to stokes component , and @xmath97 whereas @xmath96 represents the negative - frequency part of the fluctuations of the output fields , corresponding to anti - stokes component , and @xmath98    in the context of stokes and anti - stokes radiation generated by single atoms , several authors @xcite found important quantum correlations between the stokes and anti - stokes radiation .",
    "such conclusions were drawn from the structure of photon - photon correlations .",
    "motivated by these studies and the fact that we are dealing with a macroscopic system like a nanomechanical mirror ; we examine photon - photon correlations in the generated radiation .    in the following , like in the work of kolchin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we do not differentiate between the stokes and anti - stokes photons .",
    "we calculate the coincidence probability defined by    @xmath99    in which @xmath100 is a time delay , and @xmath101    now we would evaluate the photon - photon correlations of the output fields numerically .",
    "we choose the pump power @xmath23=1 and 4 mw and the temperature of the environment @xmath102 k ; the other parameters are the same as those mentioned in sec .",
    "the correlation function @xmath103 between the spontaneously generated photons versus the time delay @xmath100 for different pump powers at a temperature of @xmath102k is displayed in fig .",
    "we find that @xmath103 is symmetric .",
    "it is also seen that @xmath104 as @xmath105 .",
    "this demonstrates the presence of photon antibunching , which is definitely of quantum origin .",
    "further , we note the cauchy - schwartz inequality @xmath106 is violated , and the degree of the violation of the cauchy - schwartz inequality becomes smaller with increasing pump power . for pump power @xmath107 mw , the peak value of @xmath103 is about 17 , and @xmath108 ; thus , @xmath1095.6 .",
    "however , for @xmath110 mw , the peak value of @xmath103 is about 11.5 , and @xmath108 , so @xmath1093.8 .",
    "therefore , the spontaneously generated photons from the optomechanical system at @xmath102 k are correlated nonclassically , and the nonclassical correlation becomes weaker with increasing pump power .",
    "this is reminiscent of the parametric downconversion process which at low pumping powers produces significant quantum correlations .",
    "we have shown that an optomechanical system driven by a pump field and a stokes field can lead to generation of a four - wave - mixing signal . the stokes field is amplified .",
    "we also find that normal - mode splitting occurs in both the generated fields , that is , in both stokes and anti - stokes fields .",
    "we also report lifetime splitting for pump power less than a critical power .",
    "further , we have discussed the correlations of the photons generated from an optomechanical system by spontaneous processes .",
    "we find the correlations between these photons manifest the antibunching effect , and violate cauchy - schwartz inequality .",
    "further , the violation of the cauchy - schwartz inequality becomes weaker with increasing pump power .",
    "hence , the optomechanical system can be used to generate pairs of photons with quantum correlations .",
    "thus the study of both stimulated and spontaneous stokes and anti - stokes signals provides us with a useful technique for studying the strong coupling regime of cavity optomechanics , as well as quantum fluctuations at macroscopic level .",

    "we also thank markus aspelmeyer for giving us the experimental data on normal - mode splitting before publication and for continued correspondence .",
