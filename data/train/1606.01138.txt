    "the data have been treated using the latest version ( 15.0.0 ) of the  science analysis system ( sas ) with the most recent ( 13 march 2016 ) calibrations .",
    "we used all epic ( strder et al . 2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) cameras equipped with the medium filter .",
    "the arrival times of the events were corrected to the solar system barycentre , applying the barycen task of sas .",
    "we screened the periods of enhanced particle - induced activity by inspecting the epic - pn 10 - 15 kev light curves , binned with 5  s resolution , extracted from a circular region , with 5  arcmin radius , close to the border of the field of view .",
    "we then filter out all the periods with more than 0.85 cts  s@xmath6 .",
    "since the main focus of the observation was the study of the full extension of the dust scattering halo around the source , the epic - pn camera was in full frame mode .",
    "having a frame time of 73.4  ms , the inner core of the point spread function shows pile up . on the other hand ,",
    "both epic - mos1 and mos2 were in timing mode , with a frame time of 1.75  ms .",
    "this assures that no pile up is present in these datasets .",
    "a bad column is falling in the center of the extraction region in the epic - mos1 camera , inducing lower statistics . therefore these data have been used for consistency checks only . to reduce pile up ,",
    "the source photons in the epic - pn camera were extracted from an annular region .",
    "the outer radius of the annulus was limited to 40 arcsec , to avoid contribution from the low mass x - ray binary  ( ponti et al .",
    "2015 ) and the inner radius has been fixed to 15 arcsec . by comparing this spectrum from the wings of the point spread function with the pile - up free epic - mos2 spectrum , we verified that it is not affected by pile up .",
    "we note that the magnetar sgr  j1745 - 2900 ( rea et al . 2013 ) is located inside the source extraction region .",

    "2015 ) . in the epic - mos2 camera , the source photons were extracted between rawx @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the larger extraction region , imposed by the timing mode , implies a larger contribution from  and diffuse emission , compared to the epic - pn spectrum .",
    "we converted the source extraction region ( from rawx coordinates into sky coordinates through the sas task ecoordconv ) and we extracted the background plus diffuse emission from the epic - mos2 camera , during the same long observation ( obsid 0505670101 ) with  in quiescence . because of the higher contamination by  we use the epic - mos spectra for comparison only .",
    "we note that the same best fit parameters ( with all values consistent with the ones obtained by fitting the epic - pn spectrum ;  [ specxmm ] ) were obtained by fitting the epic - mos spectra .    the combination of high column density of absorbing material ( @xmath14  @xmath5 ) and the intense diffuse emission in the direction towards the galactic center , prevents us from obtaining a good characterisation of the source emission below @xmath15  kev ( e.g. , the low energy absorption edges ) .",
    "for this reason in this work we do not consider the data from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) instruments .",

    ", we used the  data before the outburst of .",
    "since there was no _ swift _ observation of this region between 03 - 11 - 2015 and 05 - 02 - 2016 , we retrieved 15 _ swift _ observations between 15 - 10 - 2015 and 02 - 11 - 2015 in xrt pc mode when the source was quiescent .",
    "these 15 observations are used to measure the background plus diffuse emission underneath .",
    "we applied the standard data reduction following the threads described on the _ swift _ website . because of the high absorption column density towards the source , we considered only data in the 2 - 10  kev band .",
    "images and spectra were produced using the xselect ( v2.4c ) package .",
    "since  is very bright , significant pile up is affecting all the pc mode observations .",
    "we followed the standard xrt pile - up thread to determine the pile - up level .",
    "we extracted the products from an annulus with inner radius of 15@xmath17 , to ensure that spectra , fluxes and light curves are not affected by pile up .",
    "a 40@xmath17 outer radius is used to include most source flux and less contamination from .",
    "we manually adjusted the astrometry of all datasets by visually inspecting the images of all the observations .",
    "this has been obtained by adjusting the relative position between  and ax j1745.6 - 2901 .",
    "this allows us to correct the astrometry shifts , which would otherwise affect the psf correction and the correct determination of the source flux . by comparing the light curve with that derived without psf correction",
    ", we ensured that the uncertainties in the psf correction are not the cause of the observed source variability .",
    "we also note that the background flux underneath  is only 3% of the source flux in the 2 - 10 kev band , so it does not significantly contaminate the light curve of , either .",
    "in addition to the pc mode data , there are also 12 _ swift _ xrt windowed timing ( wt ) mode observations of .",
    "compared to the pc mode , the wt mode provides higher time resolution and more counts , but the 1-dimensional image in the wt mode makes it difficult to determine the background underneath the source region from previous observations as we did in the pc mode .",

    "the choice of 20@xmath17 radius was a compromise between including more source flux and less contamination from . for eleven wt mode observations ,",
    "there were also pc mode observations on the same day , for which we could compare the spectra between the two modes . for nine observations ,",
    "both the spectral shape and normalization were consistent between the two modes , except that wt mode provided more counts and thus higher s / n .",
    "the remaining two wt mode spectra ( obsid : 00035063134 , 00035063136 ) have the same spectral shape as in the pc mode but with different normalisation .",
    "we found that this is caused by the bad pixels within the source extraction region in these two wt mode observations , which affected the source flux and psf correction , but did not affect the spectral shape .",
    "we excluded these two observations from further analysis .",
    "since the source spectra from wt mode observations were consistent with the pc mode , and the background underneath  was much weaker than the source itself , we decided to apply the same background flux and spectra for the wt mode data as for the pc mode , and this should not affect our results .",

    "the scatter in the fundamental plane is approximately an order of magnitude so that values as high as 100  mjy are possible .",
    "the imaging non - detection with an rms of 6  mjy , thus , can neither rule out nor confirm the presence of a jet in this system .",
    "we note that by the time the first vla observation has been taken ,  already transitioned to the soft state .",
    "second , bright radio emission can be produced through interaction of a jet with the dense interstellar medium of the galactic center .",
    "the low - mass x - ray binary cxogc j174540.0 - 290031 , located only 0.1 pc in projection from , reached a peak flux density of 100  mjy that was resolved into two lobes on either sides of the x - ray ( bower et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the proximity of  to sgr  a  west suggests that it could produce similar interactions but we find no evidence for these .",
    "the emission of , during the  observation is dominated by a thermal component that can be well fitted either by multi - temperature disc black body , or black body emission .",
    "in addition , emission at higher energies ( up to 20 - 50  kev ) is clearly detected by .",
    "the high energy emission is a clear sign of a comptonization component , ruling out a double thermal component consistent with the fits limited to energies below 10  kev .",
    "the disc black - body plus comptonisation scenario is perfectly compatible either with a ns or bh primary . in this framework",
    ", the comptonization component might be associated with the coronal emission typically observed in accreting sources and the multi - temperature disc black body could be produced by a standard accretion disc extending down to @xmath235  r@xmath88 for a neutron star ( @xmath236  m@xmath93 ) or @xmath15  r@xmath88 for a bh with @xmath237  m@xmath93 . in the second scenario ( model 1 and 1s in tab .",
    "[ double ] and [ integr ] , respectively ) , the presence of the black body emission suggests that the primary is a ns .",
    "also in this scenario , the comptonisation might be due to coronal emission , but the soft radiation would be dominated by the boundary layer emission .",
    "however , the best fit black body radius appears to be too large ( @xmath84  km ) to be associated with a conceivable ns .",
    "nevertheless , we can not exclude that the large observed area , attributed to the black body emission , might be induced by the contribution from a disc emission component not considered in our modelling .",
    "alternatively , the black body component might be in part produced by hot spots on the surface of the ns .",
    "would this indeed be the case , then a pulsation should be present . however , this pulsation might be undetected either because of the weakness of the black body emission or because  is a fast spinning millisecond pulsar ( e.g. , faster than our timing resolution , or a weak signal possibly also smeared by a doppler orbital shift ) .    from the spectral behaviour of",
    "we can rule out a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) nature of the source .",
    "the spectra of hmxbs are characterised by a dominant hard power law in the 0.2@xmath23810.0 kev band with typical photon indices of 1.0@xmath2381.5 for supergiant systems and around 0.9 for be / x - ray binaries ( e.g. haberl et al .",
    "2008 ; bozzo et al .",
    "2012 ; bodaghee et al . 2012 ; walter et al .",
    "hmxbs also do not show spectra state transitions as observed from .",
    "was initially identified as a possible magnetar due to its fast outburst rise .",
    "however , many observational characteristics of this new transient are at variance with what is usually observed in magnetar outbursts ( see rea & esposito 2011 and turolla , zane & watts 2015 for a review on outbursts and on magnetars in general , respectively ) .",
    "the strong variability of the outburst flux decay ( see fig.[fig - variability ] ) is unseen in the outburst decay of magnetars , which are usually observed to decay smoothly toward quiescence .",
    "this is also in line with the interpretation of these outbursts as being due to a large energy injection in the magnetar crust triggered by the instability of the internal or external magnetic field ( possibly by a strongly twisted magnetic bundle ) , with a consequent crustal heating and subsequent cooling ( beloborodov 2009 ; pons & rea 2012 ) .",
    "furthermore , if placed at 8kpc the peak luminosity of the outburst is too high with respect to what is observed for magnetars , @xmath239erg / s , which is a limit believed to be regulated by the strong dependence on temperature of the crustal neutrino emissivity ( pons & rea 2012 ) .",
    "the deep upper limits on the pf of this new transient ( see fig.[pf ] ) are rather unlikely ( although a few exceptions exists ) compared with the usual strength ( @xmath2020 - 80% ) of the periodic signals ( around 2 - 10s ) observed for magnetars .",
    "therefore , we believe the magnetar interpretation for this new transient is extremely unlikely .    observations of the x - ray reflection nebulae ( irradiated molecular clouds within a few hundred parsecs from ) suggest an either solar or supersolar iron abundance of the gc ism ( revnitsev et al . 2004 ; terrier et al . 2010 ; ponti et al . 2010 ; 2013 ; 2014b ; zhang et al .",
    "the observed low iron abundance ( @xmath114 solar ) of the neutral absorbing material towards  is therefore rather surprising also with respect to the accepted iron gradient in the galactic disk ( friel et al .",
    "2002 ; pedicelli et al .",
    "we note that the measured value is consistent with the iron abundance towards 4u  1820 - 303 , an x - ray binary located at a distance of @xmath240  kpc , at less than 1  kpc from the gc ( towards @xmath241 and @xmath242 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "2003 ; pinto et al .",
    "the observed under abundance is also in line with the values measured towards a small sample of bright galactic x - ray binaries ( juett et al .",
    "we attribute this to depletion of iron into dust grains in the ism ( see juett et al .",
    "2006 ) . indeed ,",
    "depletion of elements in dust grains can reduce the effective cross section for absorption . in grains ,",
    "the optical depth can be higher than one , therefore absorption will occur primarily on the surface .",
    "moreover , iron atoms located deeper into the grain will be shielded and they will not contribute to the absorption , effectively reducing the strength of the element absorption edge ( e.g. juett et al .",
    "the similarity of the observed iron abundance to the ones measured along many other line of sights , is consistent with the idea that a significant fraction of the absorption is produced in the ism along the galactic arms and therefore it does not carry information about the metal abundances characteristic of the gc region .",
    "future detailed modelling of the dust scattering halo of  and   will better constrain this .",
    "given the long - term x - ray variability and spectral decomposition , we then identify  as an accreting x - ray binary hosting a neutron star or a black - hole , most likely with a low mass star companion . the discovery and identification of this new gc transient as well as the continuous x - ray monitoring of the central parsec is improving the determination of the population of stellar remnants orbiting .",
