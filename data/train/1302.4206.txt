    "@xmath14 are the pauli matrices and the index @xmath15 of the chemical potential is s for in the superconducting part and ti in the topological insulator . from this hamiltonian we calculated the eigenvectors of the ti in the presence of the proximimty effects .",
    "we assume the superconductor to be an s - wave superconductor , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the superconducting phase and @xmath18 outside the superconductor .",
    "this heaviside function of the order parameter simplifies the calculations .",
    "however , it is not expected that there will be a qualitatively difference with the results when a self - consistent order parameter is used .",
    "as for example is shown in ref . for a d - wave superconductor",
    "where the induced order parameter is taken into account in the normal metal , the andreev bound state spectrum does not change near zero - energy .",
    "it is this regime in the spectrum that is relevant for the appearance of a majorana mode .",
    "the non - superconducting part can be under the influence of a ferromagnetic proximity effect . in majorana devices",
    "the magnetization is taken perpendicular to the ti surface , @xmath19 ( the resulting eigenvectors are listed in the appendix ) .",
    "magnetization parallel to the interface causes only a shift in the wave vector but does not open a gap . in the known topological insulators ,",
    "the dirac point is in the middle of the band gap or close to the valence band .",
    "the chemical potential is usually close to the conduction band as the topological insulators based on bi - compounds are not really good insulators yet .",
    "therefore , the chemical potential , @xmath20 , is much larger than the superconducting gap in experiments . in this case",
    "we have only normal andreev reflection at the interface and no specular andreev reflection @xcite .",
    "for most proposals it is desired to have a ferromagnet on top of the ti ( preferably an insulator so that practically no current flows through the ferromagnet)@xcite .",
    "we estimate here how much the gap at the dirac point can be opened by such a ferromagnet .",
    "for a magnetic moment of @xmath21 per unit cell of size @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an integer and @xmath24 is the bohr magneton , we can estimate the value of the @xmath25 part of the hamiltonian . making the assumption that the atoms can be approximated by spheres with @xmath23 elementary dipoles and perfect coupling to the ti , we estimate that the opened gap will be about 0.0002@xmath26 ev where @xmath27 is in ngstrm .",
    "this value is typically smaller than the value of the fermi energy inside the gap ( @xmath28 ev ) .",
    "we therefore study the relevant regime of @xmath29 .    with these assumptions",
    "we solve the andreev and normal reflection coefficients at both left and right interfaces for incoming electrons and holes by matching the wave functions at the interface .",
    "following kulik@xcite ( see example in ref . ) , the wave function in the topological insulator can be written as @xmath30 where the index @xmath31 and @xmath32 indicate an electron and hole wave function respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 are related by @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the second indices of the wave functions refer to the right ( r ) and left ( l ) interface .",
    "the right interface is placed at @xmath36 and the left interface at @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the angle of incidence from the ti to the s where zero angle means orthogonal to the interface .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the wave vectors of the hole and electron respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath41 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the mismatch between these wave vectors and the wave vector in the superconductor causes an effective barrier at the interface .",
    "the superconducting gap can be neglected in this mismatch as @xmath42 .",
    "conservation of @xmath43 ( due to translational invariance ) then gives for the angle of transmission in the superconductor : @xmath44 .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ eq1:zagoskin ] ) gives the energy as a function of the phase difference , @xmath45 , between the superconductors .",
    "first , we consider the case with no ferromagnet on top of the ti . for perpendicular incidence we find a 4@xmath0 periodic abs with a gapless dispersion , even in the presence of a momentum mismatch ( the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ; the arrows in fig . [ fig:2](a ) follow one abs that is 4@xmath0 periodic ) . however , in the presence of a momentum mismatch , a nonzero angle of incidence results in a nonzero scattering amplitude and a gap is always present ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( a - c ) ) .",
    "the larger the mismatch between the wave vectors , the larger is the gap that opens . for @xmath46",
    "the interface is effectively fully transparent and all trajectories give a 4@xmath0 periodic abs .",
    "this is a consequence of the model where the superconducting gap is neglected .",
    "the opening of the gap at finite angles is due to finite back scattering at non - zero angle of incidence . for a larger mismatch between the chemical potentials ,",
    "the difference in angles of the particle in the ti and superconductor is larger .",
    "this causes also a larger mismatch in the spin direction which increases the barrier and hence results in more reflected electrons . only at zero angle of incidence ,",
    "back scattering is prohibited by the topological nature .",
    "so in experiments no 4@xmath0 periodicity of the abss can be obtained for all angles ; it is a single channel effect as is also concluded by fu and kane@xcite for a system with a small @xmath20 .",
    "note , that even when this 4@xmath0 periodic abs is present , it will only be noticeable in ac measurements since interactions with the environment already cause the system to reside in the lower ( 2@xmath0 ) abs branches @xcite .    for a different length ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( c ) ) the curve corresponding to @xmath47 is now lower in energy than the bound states of @xmath48 and @xmath49 compared to the graphs of fig . [",
    "fig:2](a ) and ( b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( e ) the bound state energy for specific angles at @xmath50 is plotted as function of length .",
    "we see an oscillating behavior as function of length due to a fabry - perot resonance .",
    "the oscillation period is determined by the fabry - perot resonant condition : @xmath51 with @xmath52 the wave vector in the topological insulator and @xmath23 an integer@xcite .",
    "there is a strong similarity to a normal sns junction . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( f ) a plot is made of the bound state energy of a sns junction for a fixed angle of @xmath53 and phase difference of @xmath0 by determining the pole in the spectral supercurrent in eq .",
    "( 5 ) of ref .",
    "i.e. @xmath54where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 corresponds with a pole in imaginary space which is equal to the energy of the andreev bound state .",
    "the decrease of the amplitude is determined by the ratio of the length of the junction and the coherence length of the superconductor in the topological insulator .",
    "it should however be noted that varying the junction length will not result in a closing of the gap at a certain length .",
    "the calculation above is valid for every particular angle .",
    "when all angles are included the oscillations will be averaged out .",
    "+   + when a ferromagnet is included , the magnetization is found to decrease the gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( d ) ) .",
    "this can be understood by considering the extreme case where the magnetization @xmath63 is close to the chemical potential so that the wave vectors of the electrons and holes are nearly zero ( eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) . in that case",
    "it also follows from the conservation of @xmath43 that @xmath64 is practically zero . then by using the eigenvectors ( eq .",
    "( 10 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 17 ) ) in the appendix and substitute these values of the wave vectors and angle into them , the resulting equations at the interfaces simplify . from these equations",
    "it can be seen that there is perfect andreev reflection .",
    "quantitatively it can be understood by noticing that the mismatch between the spins for the different particles in the system also causes a barrier . by the magnetization",
    "this mismatch becomes smaller due to the alignment .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we show the bound states as a function of @xmath65 , the wave vector parallel to the interface .",
    "for a phase difference of @xmath0 between the superconductors we see that the zero energy mode has a dispersion as function of @xmath65 .",
    "this is also called a nonchiral majorana state @xcite . for large mismatch between @xmath66 and @xmath52",
    "the model of fu and kane applies @xcite where the chemical potential is smaller than the superconducting gap .",
    "this situation resembles the case of a large mismatch at the interface in our case as the waves in the superconductor are then fully evanescent . for smaller mismatches the gap is smaller , which results in smaller slopes in the @xmath67 graphs .",
    "a smaller slope indicates a smaller velocity of this propagating mode along the interface as already noted in ref . .",
    "from the same reasoning as in the previous paragraph , the @xmath67 graphs have a smaller slope if magnetization is included . the result for @xmath68",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ( c ) .",
    "in this section , we numerically calculate the angle - averaged supercurrent of the andreev bound states .",
    "we consider here only the supercurrents for small junction length as longer lengths give no additional features regarding the 4@xmath0 periodic abs and the influence of the chemical potential and magnetization on this . in the work of ref . discretized",
    "bound states were used but the continuum was missing in the calculation for larger length scales . because we only consider here small length scales , only the discretized spectrum has to be considered @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "three plots of this normalized josephson supercurrent are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( a ) .",
    "the temperature is @xmath71 with @xmath72 the critical temperature .",
    "although a 4@xmath0 periodicity is present in the andreev bound state for zero angle of incidence , the other channels are 2@xmath0 periodic .",
    "hence , the 2@xmath0 periodic character is dominating the angle - averaged supercurrent and therefore this current will be 2@xmath0 periodic in measurements .",
    "moreover , the thermal equilibrium of the system even makes the abs for zero angle of incidence 2@xmath0 periodic since inelastic scattering can relax quasiparticles to an abs that is lower in energy@xcite .",
    "this thermal equilibrium is due to the exchange between the bulk superconducting electrodes and the andreev bound state levels in the junction@xcite .",
    "we see that for larger mismatch the supercurrent as function of phase has a more sinusoidal shape . for small mismatches",
    "there is a sharp transition at @xmath50 from positive to negative supercurrent which is also the case in a normal superconducting junction@xcite . also for a larger mismatch or for a magnetization",
    "the slope of the energy - phase curves become less steep , causing a smaller supercurrent for both cases . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( b ) we plot the dependence of the normalized @xmath73 product as a function of mismatch in fermi level and as function of magnetization .",
    "@xmath74 is here averaged over all angles . for larger mismatch in fermi level the value of the @xmath75",
    "is saturating towards 0.5@xmath0 as expected in the tunneling limit .",
    "for small mismatch the value is @xmath0 as is also the case in the ballistic limit in normal sns junctions .",
    "the critical current is also decreasing for a larger magnetization .",
    "however , we see that for values larger than @xmath76 the critical current is increasing again . when analyzing the andreev bound states we notice that there is a competition between the flatting of the bound states and the lowering of the barrier both due to magnetization .",
    "the latter depends on the relative magnitude of the magnetization to the mismatch . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( b ) the mismatch of the wave vectors due to a difference in the chemical potentials , is relatively small : @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the aligning of the spins for larger magnetization can therefore make the interface almost transparent .",
    "the corresponding andreev bound states also resemble therefore an almost transparent interface : small gap and at @xmath79 and @xmath80 the energy is @xmath81 . for a larger difference between @xmath82 and @xmath83 ,",
    "the effect is less and the critical current is monotonically decreasing for larger magnetization . however , if we analyze the normal resistance , the resistance increases for larger magnetization .",
    "this is because the spins in the topological insulator with the ferromagnet on top are now more _ misaligned _ compared to the topological insulator side without a ferromagnet on top . the combination of both an increasing @xmath84 and @xmath74 , results in a normalized @xmath75 product of @xmath80",
    "we have seen that the 4@xmath0 periodic abs is a single channel effect for perpendicular trajectories only .",
    "next to it , measuring in thermal equilibrium makes even the single 4@xmath0 abs 2@xmath0 periodic because the electrons will follow the lowest abs branches , i.e. below @xmath85 .",
    "the latter can be solved by doing ac measurements such as shapiro step and/or noise measurements .",
    "the 4@xmath0 periodic abs will only contribute to the shapiro steps at a voltage equal to @xmath86 , where @xmath23 is an integer and @xmath87 the frequency of the applied microwave @xcite .",
    "a 2@xmath0 periodic abs will result in shapiro steps at @xmath88 which is half the step size of the 4@xmath0 periodic bound state .",
    "however , due to the presence of just one single 4@xmath0 periodic abs in 3d tis / superconductor josephson junctions out of many , one would expect that a 4@xmath0 periodic signature in ac measurements is not visible due to angle - averaging .",
    "usually , one can enhance the zero angle contribution by introducing a physical barrier of finite width due to the exponential dependence of the wave function on the width .",
    "it is however not possible to cancel the nonzero angles by introducing a physical barrier between the superconductor and ti because of klein tunneling which renders barriers effectively transparent ( see for example the discussion of klein tunneling in graphene in ref . ) .",
    "so in order to see a 4@xmath0 periodic abs , the abss of all angles should be 4@xmath0 periodic . by means of zener tunneling",
    "this can be achieved .",
    "in order to obtain zener tunneling , a bias voltage across the junction is required ( which is for example the case in shapiro steps measurements ) . due to this bias voltage",
    "the quasi - particles in the junction can gain enough kinetic energy so that they can transfer from a lower andreev bound state to an upper bound state despite the separation by a gap@xcite .",
    "it is noted in ref .",
    "that for large transparency of the interface this can result in a @xmath89 periodic abs .",
    "so when the gap is small , it can not be distinguished anymore from an andreev bound state without a gap .",
    "hence , when electrons in the lower branch of these andreev bound states with small gaps are promoted to the upper branch , it can result in @xmath89 periodic signatures in ac measurements @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) a sketch is shown of an abs with a finite but small gap . due to magnetization",
    "this can result in a 4@xmath0 periodic signature in for example shapiro step and/or noise measurements .",
    "physically the small gap is similar to having a finite length in the 1d kitaev model where also a gap is present due to the interaction of the majorana fermions at the ends @xcite . a way to reduce the gaps of all non - zero angle of incidence channels in a 3d ti in order to enhance the chance of zener tunneling to get",
    "the @xmath89 periodicity of all abss , is by exploiting magnetization as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](d ) .",
    "the influence of the magnitude of the magnetization depends first of all on the relative magnitude of the chemical potentials to each other as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:4](d ) .",
    "the larger the mismatch the less the influence is of the magnetization .",
    "secondly , the influence of the magnetization depends on its magnitude compared to the absolute magnitude of the chemical potential . with a larger chemical potential ,",
    "the influence of the magnetization is less . to get a clearer picture of the influence of the magnetization",
    ", we have plotted the gap in the andreev bound state ( at @xmath50 ) for several conditions in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( d ) . for an increase of mismatch",
    "we kept the magnetization constant to @xmath90 , length @xmath91 and angle @xmath49 .",
    "a similar result is obtained for other angles .",
    "further @xmath77 for both graphs .",
    "we see that the gap is a strong function of magnetization in the beginning but saturates at larger mismatches in the chemical potentials .",
    "the graph that shows the influence of the magnetization has a constant ( small ) mismatch @xmath92 and @xmath77 .",
    "when the magnetization energy is half the value of the fermi level in the ti , the energy gap is already decreased by 50% of its original value at zero magnetization . however we have estimated before that the magnetization energy is typically on the order of 1% of the fermi energy , i.e. @xmath93 in experiments .",
    "so only for small mismatches in the chemical potentials it is possible to reduce the gap so that by means of zener tunneling the 4@xmath0 periodicity of the abss remains for all angles . this reduction of the gap can be made visible in squid experiments as proposed in ref .",
    ", where it is shown that the reduction of the gap size results in a different critical current modulation of the squid as function of the applied flux through the ring .",
    "these results hold even in equilibrium experiments , so that these squid devices can be used for abs spectroscopy .",
    "we studied the andreev bound states and the resulting supercurrent for s / ti / s junctions with and without a ferromagnet on top of the ti . in experiments",
    "it is often the case that @xmath94 and @xmath95 and therefore we extended the model ( by fu and kane @xcite and linder _ _ et al.__@xcite ) towards this regime . the bound states are solved by means of the total wave function in the topological insulator and its relation to the reflection coefficients , providing insight in the process .",
    "the important conclusion is that the results from fu and kane @xcite ( e.g. the 4@xmath0 periodic abs existing only for @xmath96 ) still remain , even for large chemical potentials .",
    "therefore , these features are also valid in actual experiments on tis .",
    "the 4@xmath0 periodicity of the bound states only remains in a 3d topological insulator for zero angle of incidence .",
    "this 4@xmath0 feature can not be observed as all the other angles , which give 2@xmath0 periodic bound states , causes the 2@xmath0 periodicity to dominate .",
    "however , zener tunneling can cause a transition from the lower branches to the upper branches of the andreev bound states , even when a gap is present .",
    "we can enhance this zener tunneling , and hence enhancing the 4@xmath0 periodicity of the non - zero angle abss , by depositing a ferromagnet on top .",
    "the magnetization effectively lowers the barrier which causes the gap in the andreev bound states to become smaller .",
    "this work is supported by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) by the dutch foundation for fundamental research on matter ( fom ) .",
    "the eigenvectors in the topological insulator are calculated to be @xmath97 where @xmath98 with @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .",

    "<S> to guide the search for the majorana fermion , we theoretically study superconductor / topological / superconductor ( s / ti / s ) junctions in an experimentally relevant regime . we find that the striking features present in these systems , including the doubled periodicity of the andreev bound states ( abss ) due to tunneling via majorana states , can still be present at high electron densities . we show that via the inclusion of magnetic layers , this 4@xmath0 periodic abs can still be observed in three - dimensional topological insulators , where finite angle incidence usually results in the opening of a gap at zero energy and hence results in a 2@xmath0 periodic abs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study the josephson junction characteristics and find that the gap size can be controlled and decreased by tuning the magnetization direction and amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> these findings pave the way for designing experiments on s/3dti / s junctions .    </S>",
    "<S> the prediction of fu and kane @xcite that majorana fermions can be realized in superconductor@xmath13d topological insulator structures , boosted theoretical predictions for the peculiar majorana fermion properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strong progress has been made in the fabrication of two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional topological insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the three - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) based on the bi - compounds ( e.g. bi@xmath2te@xmath3 , bi@xmath2se@xmath3 ) have already led to the realization of superconductor(s)/ti / s junctions @xcite and squids @xcite . from an experimental point of view </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to realize topological insulator materials with the chemical potential at or close to the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore highly desirable to have a guiding theory in an experimentally relevant regime that can pave the way towards the verification of the majorana fermion in s / ti hybrids .            </S>",
    "<S> here we theoretically study superconductor / three - dimensional topological insulator josephson junctions . in the calculations of ref . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the fermi level is close to the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is always assumed that the ferromagnet placed on top of a ti , has a magnetization @xmath4 in these calculations . in these systems , an andreev bound state ( abs ) with a doubled periodicity is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the experimentally relevant regime of high electron densities , and show that , despite the chemical potential @xmath5 being situated far away from the dirac point , this characteristic feature is still present . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore consider the presence of a ferromagnetic layer with magnetization @xmath6 on top of the junction , and show that it can drastically alter the josephson characteristics , even when @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly interesting , since the magnetization opens a gap not at the fermi energy , as the superconducting correlations do , but at the dirac point , far away from @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a gap in the superconducting bound states spectra always opens at a finite angle of incidence . </S>",
    "<S> however , the size of this gap can be tuned and decreased , and can in principle vanish , by increasing the perpendicular magnetization amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> the discussion of the bound states of a s / ti / s junction in this article is organized as follows : first , we study the case without a ferromagnetic layer on top of the ti . </S>",
    "<S> then we discuss the bound states with a ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that a 4@xmath0 periodic andreev bound state is still present in the 3d case but only for one channel . </S>",
    "<S> this 4@xmath0 periodic abs is a feature of the presence of majorana fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we show the supercurrent obtained by the bound states and discuss the observation of a 4@xmath0 periodic abs in a 3d topological insulator . </S>"
