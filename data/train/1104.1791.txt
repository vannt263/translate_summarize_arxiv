    "the presence of ubiquitous small - amplitude propagating magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves in magnetic waveguides of the solar corona was first observed with the coronal multi - channel polarimeter ( comp ) ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the observations have inspired a number of recent theoretical works in which the properties of propagating waves are studied . based on mhd wave theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the observations have been interpreted as propagating kink waves , i.e. , transverse mhd waves with mixed fast and alfvnic properties whose dominating restoring force is magnetic tension ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that field - aligned density enhancements in the corona act as natural waveguides for mhd waves .",
    "apart from the comp observations in coronal loops , propagating kink waves have also been observed in chromospheric spicules ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in the same manner as standing kink mhd waves are damped in time by resonant absorption ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , propagating kink mhd waves are damped in space due to naturally occurring plasma inhomogeneity in the direction transverse to the the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "@xcite , hereafter tgv , obtained the important result that the damping length by resonant absorption is inversely proportional to the wave frequency .",
    "this means that high - frequency waves are damped in shorter length scales than low - frequency waves .",
    "@xcite showed that the analytical theory of propagating resonant kink waves developed by tgv is fully consistent with the comp observations .",
    "for the time - dependent , driven problem @xcite studied numerically the spatial damping of resonant kink waves and obtained equivalent results to those analytically predicted by tgv .",
    "importantly , @xcite have shown that the results of tgv still hold when the plasma is partially ionized , so that the theory can be applied to kink waves propagating in the chromosphere and in prominences as well .",
    "recently , @xcite extended the results of tgv by taking into account for the first time density variation both transversely and along the magnetic field direction .",

    "typically , the observed flow velocities are smaller than 10% of the plasma alfvn speed .",
    "faster flows of the order of the alfvn speed are much less frequent and are related to energetic events as , e.g. , flares and coronal mass ejections ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "the investigation of the effect of flow on the properties of the waves is therefore of evident interest .",
    "for example , the influence of flow and implications for mhd seismology of standing kink waves in coronal loops have been recently discussed by @xcite and @xcite . in the case of prominences ,",
    "@xcite investigated standing kink waves in coronal flux tubes partially filled with flowing threads of prominence material .",
    "nevertheless , none of these works took damping into account . also for standing waves ,",
    "@xcite studied temporal damping by resonant absorption in the presence of flow and found corrections to the damping time due to the flow with respect to the static case @xcite . however , in the case of spatial damping of propagating kink waves the effect of flow has not been investigated .",
    "tgv did not include flow in their study . to our knowledge",
    "there is no work in the literature that studies in detail the influence of flow on resonantly damped propagating waves in solar magnetic waveguides .",
    "existing investigations of surface waves in the solar wind as , e.g. , @xcite did not perform a rigorous treatment of the process of resonant absorption and considered very simplified expressions for the damping length of the waves .",
    "thus , a detailed investigation of propagating resonant mhd waves in the presence of flows in needed .    here",
    "we investigate the effect of flow on the spatial damping of resonant kink waves in transversely nonuniform solar waveguides .",
    "we attack the problem both analytically and numerically .",
    "the analytical theory uses the thin tube ( tt ) and thin boundary ( tb ) approximations to obtain expressions for the wavelength and the damping length .",
    "we determine the influence of flow and compare our expressions with those obtained by tgv in the static case .",
    "later , we use numerical methods to study the propagation and spatial damping of kink waves beyond the tt and tb approximations .",
    "the full numerical computations enable us to test the validity of the analytical expressions .",

    "the equivalent damping length in the absence of flow is in between both values ( the dotted line in fig .",

    "the dependence of the damping length on @xmath152 for both forward and backward waves is the same .",
    "as before , a very good agreement between equation  ( [ eq : ldtt ] ) and the numerical result is found even when the thickness of the transitional layer departs from the limit @xmath44 .",

    "as expected , the difference between the numerical results and the linear approximation increases as the flow velocity gets faster .",
    "however , for @xmath162 the relative difference between the full solution and the approximation is only around 10% for the forward wave and 30% for the backward wave .",
    "this means that for realistic flow velocities observed in coronal magnetic loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this result enables us to use equation  ( [ eq : ldtt ] ) , i.e. , the key equation of this investigation , when realistic values of frequency , flow velocity , and the rest of relevant parameters obtained from the observations are used .",
    "naturally , kink waves propagating in nonuniform magnetic flux tubes are spatially damped by resonant absorption . in the static case , tgv showed that the damping length is inversely proportional to the frequency .",
    "here we have investigated analytically and numerically the spatial damping of resonant kink waves in a transversely nonuniform magnetic waveguide in the presence of longitudinal background flow .",
    "longitudinal flow breaks the equivalence between forward and backward propagating waves with respect to the flow direction . the wavelength and the damping length due to resonant absorption",
    "are both affected by the flow . for sub - alfvnic flows ,",
    "the backward wavelength is shorter than that of the forward wave , and backward waves are damped in shorter length scales than forward waves .",
    "however , as in tgv we have found that the damping length of both forward and backward propagating waves is inversely proportional to the frequency .",
    "mhd seismology based on propagating waves has attracted limited attention and definitely less than its counterpart based on standing kink waves .",
    "standing kink mhd waves are rare phenomena as they need a violent and energetic event such as a solar flare for their excitation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the absence of flow and for coronal loop standing oscillations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mhd seismology has been used to obtain information of the plasma physical conditions .",
    "particularly , for a given set of parameters provided by the observations , i.e. , period , damping time , and wavelength in the case of standing waves , @xcite and @xcite showed that the possible values of @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath152 which are consistent with the theory form a one - dimensional curve in the three - dimensional parameter space . in principle , any point of this curve can equally explain the observations . @xcite and @xcite showed that more constrained estimations of @xmath164 and @xmath152 can be given in the case of prominence thread oscillations as the limit @xmath166 can be adopted .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that more accurate estimations of the parameters are possible by combining the analytical theory of @xcite with statistical bayesian analysis . in the presence of flows ,",
    "@xcite have recently explained also for standing waves that the flow velocity can be estimated from the wave phase difference along the magnetic loop .",
    "on the contrary , propagating mhd waves are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and provide a huge reservoir of possibilities for seismology .",
    "some examples of mhd seismology based on propagating waves are , e.g. , @xcite using numerical simulations of guided mhd waves by density enhancements in the solar corona , @xcite using observations of kink waves in prominence threads , @xcite using resonantly damped kink waves in coronal loops , and @xcite exploiting the properties of kink waves in chromospheric spicules .",
    "however , none of these works included flow in their analysis .",
    "our theoretical results given in equations  ( [ eq : lam2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ldtt ] ) have direct implications for mhd seismology based on propagating waves in a flowing medium , and could be used to infer information about the plasma properties .",
    "therefore , the potential application of mhd seismology to the case of resonantly damped propagating kink waves in a flowing medium must be explored .",
    "in the presence of flow two waves with different wavelengths and damping lengths but with the same frequency ( or period ) are simultaneously present .",
    "we denote as @xmath167 and @xmath168 the wavelength and damping length of the forward wave , respectively , and as @xmath169 and @xmath170 the equivalent quantities of the backward wave .",
    "observationally , this means that it is possible to measure five quantities , namely @xmath167 , @xmath169 , @xmath168 , @xmath170 , and the period , while the rest of parameters , i.e. , @xmath164 , @xmath15 , @xmath152 , and @xmath165 are in principle unknown . in this analysis",
    "we assume @xmath171 for simplicity .",
    "we also take @xmath169 as a positive quantity and so we perform the absolute value of equation  ( [ eq : lam2 ] ) when the @xmath58 sign is used . if observations can provide us with reliable values for the wavelengths and damping lengths of the two waves , then we can use our theoretical results ( equations  ( [ eq : lam2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ldtt ] ) ) to obtain seismological estimations for the unknown quantities @xmath164 , @xmath15 , @xmath152 , and @xmath165 as @xmath172 with @xmath173 the period and @xmath174 in the absence of flow , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "then , equations  ( [ eq : seis1 ] ) and ( [ eq : seis3 ] ) are equivalent to the expressions studied by @xcite , and the density contrast ( equation  ( [ eq : seis4 ] ) ) becomes indeterminate .",
    "thanks to the flow , the density contrast can be determined if reliable measures of the wavelengths and damping lengths of both forward and backward waves are available .    the theoretical results of the present paper offer new and exciting opportunities for mhd seismology in plasma structures with equilibrium flows .",
    "for the first time we have shown that an estimation of the density contrast , @xmath177 , is possible .",
    "mhd seismology requires theory and observations .",
    "the required observations might not be available at present time .",
    "however , the seismological tool provided in equations  ( [ eq : seis1])([eq : seis4 ] ) could be used in the future when the required observations become available .    the investigation performed in this paper",
    "may be improved in the future by incorporating additional physics in the mhd wave model .",
    "effects that come to mind are the variation of the plasma parameters along the magnetic field direction as in @xcite and magnetic expansion and twist of the flux tube . these and other effects might be included in forthcoming investigations on propagating resonant kink waves .",
