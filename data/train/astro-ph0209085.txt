    "since 1997 the da of ug ( daug ) is housed at 2200 m above sea level , overlooking the city of guanajuato , close to the `` geometrical center '' of mexico , and declared as `` heritage of mankind '' by unesco .",
    "the research staff of eight astronomers participates in undergraduate teaching within the physics and other programs at ug , and hopes to offer a postgraduate program in astrophysics soon .",
    "the da maintains the _ observatorio la luz _ with a 57-cm optical reflector , used for public outreach purposes and being prepared as a student laboratory .",
    "the two founder - members of the da had already collected ( by donations ) a few decades of _ apj , aj _ , and _ mnras _ , but other major journals ( like _ a&a _ ) had been subscribed only since 1994 . since my arrival ,",
    "in late 1996 , i volunteered as `` provisional '' librarian , given the lack of a professional department librarian hired by ug .",
    "the central library of ug was too far away to manage efficiently the library of the da .",
    "as a matter of fact this situation continues until now .    after preparing the first inventory of our holdings in early 1997 , i posted an inquiry to astrolib for donations to fill the holes of our journal coverage",
    "this caused a wave of offers from professional librarians all over the world .",
    "hundreds of kilos of journals were received over the following months . in june 1997",
    "the da moved to its present building with only 6 offices for 10 people , and no library  room .",
    "however , our neighbor , the maths research center `` cimat '' , maintained by the mexican science foundation conacyt , generously offered @xmath060m@xmath1 of their library `` provisionally '' for the da .",
    "cimat is @xmath0200 m away ( @xmath040 m vertical ! ) , _ but _ it _ closes _ during nights and weekends which never made it attractive for a `` leisure visit '' .",
    "after five years nothing has changed !",
    "as it was not practical to store all our holdings `` up there '' at cimat , we decided to use all possibly available space in the offices and corridors for the most recent journals ( @xmath01 year back ) and modern books ( for teaching and research ) . until now our hopes to obtain a dedicated library were not fulfilled , despite a written promise and money allocation by ug in spring 2001 .",
    "thus the journals have grown hopelessly beyond their initially assigned growth space .",
    "maintaining the alphabetic order of journals would now imply a full rearrangement of our holdings which is beyond our available manpower .",
    "moreover , in the meantime most of our journal holdings have become available freely from ads , making a visit to the physical library each time less attractive to our staff .",
    "however , downloading of articles is often limited to weekends given our slow internet line .    in the absence of a librarian , or other suitable personnel ,",
    "i  only seal the books with a da stamp but do not afford to assign them a catalog number , so they have no `` reproducible '' shelf location yet .",
    "moreover , in mid-1999 a heavy rain and a leaky window affected part of our shelves at cimat , and about 15% of our book holdings , many of them of historic interest , were waterlogged .",
    "most of the book holdings had to be removed in a hurry ( in my absence ) and since then only very limited `` order '' was re - established .",
    "i visit the library at most once a month to accommodate what does not fit any more in our office building .",
    "since its foundation the da received the six major astronomy journals by personal subscription .",
    "the idea was that we would gradually be able to pay institutional rates , but with a 2002 budget of usd3000 we still can not afford a single journal at the institutional rate .",
    "thanks to the generous permit by some publishers to continue with the personal rate , we manage to subscribe to _ apj , apjs , aj , mnras , a&a , nature , pasa , pasj , pasp , baas , s&t _ , and _",
    "mercury_. these regular funds also allow us to buy very few conference proceedings ( mainly from the rather economic _",
    "asp conf .",
    "series _ ) and iau symposia .",
    "the budget for books and other proceedings depends on the allocation of special funds from the federal secretary of public education ( sep ) and on personal research projects ( usually from conacyt ) , and fluctuates between 0 and 8000  usd / yr . delays in either the invoices of journal publishers , or in the payment by our central library , usually cause an interruption of our subscriptions during the first few months of each year ( does this sound familiar to you ... ? ) .",
    "altogether , we are far from the ideal situation described in my earlier wishlist ( andernach 1998 ) .",
    "thanks to frequent offers of duplicate items from professional astronomy librarians ( e.g.  va astrolib ) we acquired an impressive amount of ( mostly older ) journals and monographs .",
    "naturally many of these items are of interest to either the bibliophile or historians of astronomy and physics .",
    "while filling me with pride , it is a shame to store these books some 200  m away from our offices where hardly any of us finds the leisure to go and browse the shelves .",
    "i maintain the inventory as a single ascii file ( of @xmath0300 kb ) , readable by all members of the da .",
    "it saves me to learn dedicated library software and allows an easy search of items using unix s grep command .",
    "for journals i use bibcode - style , and free format for the `` rest '' ( monographs , theses , manuals , etc .",
    ", currently @xmath0700 items ) .",

    "the changes in the job market and the internet have affected radically not only the way astronomers work , but also how an astronomy library is run , especially at small and `` poor '' places .",
    "today small groups of astronomers are established independently of favorable sky conditions and rely mainly on an adequate internet connection , but often have to work without a professional librarian .",
    "while this may work `` well '' , i.e.  with little effect on research output as in our case , it certainly relies heavily on the services provided by a few professional librarians thinking far beyond their own institution .",
