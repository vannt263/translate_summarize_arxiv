    "magnetic lattices consisting of periodic arrays of current - carrying wires  @xcite or permanent magnetic films  @xcite have recently been proposed as an alternative approach to optical lattices  @xcite for trapping and manipulating small clouds of ultracold atoms and quantum degenerate gases , including bose - einstein condensates .",
    "magnetic lattices may be considered as complementary to optical lattices , in much the same way as magnetic traps are complementary to optical dipole traps : they do not require ( intense and stable ) laser beams and there is no decoherence or light scattering due to spontaneous emission ; they can produce highly stable and reproducible potential wells leading to high trap frequencies ; and only atoms in low magnetic field seeking states are trapped , thus allowing the possibility of performing rf evaporative cooling @xmath0 @xmath1 in the lattice and the study of very low temperature phenomena in a periodic lattice .",

    "analytical expressions are presented for various physical quantities and compared with numerical calculations . in one of the configurations of magnets , we show that by varying the angle between the crossed arrays of magnets it is possible to go from a 1d array of microtraps to a 2d array of microtraps .",
