    "field - theoretic models defined in a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time have been studied for nearly two decades@xcite .",
    "actually , lower - dimensional models have provided many interesting results which do not take place in the ( 3 + 1)d world , e.g. , schwinger mechanism in qed@xmath0@xcite and fractional statistics in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "consequently , lower - dimensional theories can not be considered as mere lower limits of four - dimensional ones ; they have rather revealed characteristics that are intrinsic to its dimensionality .",
    "+   + on the other hand , some ( 2 + 1)d theories , whenever supplemented by a chern - simons term , turn out to exhibit a new interesting physical content , as for example , maxwell and einstein - hilbert actions @xcite .",

    "+   + although maxwell and maxwell - chern - simons ( mainly the latter , in both abelian and non - abelian frameworks ) have attracted a great deal of efforts , it is curious that one has not provided an `` electrodynamical body '' ( linard - wiechert - type potentials , larmor - like formula and so forth ) for such ( say , abelian ) theories which would be similar to the one we have for ( 3 + 1)d maxwell .  thus , we shall try to draw the attention to the fact that the `` lack '' of a complete `` electrodynamical body '' is related to some serious difficulties , for instance , in calculating @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) for a single accelerated point - like charge .  in view of that , a larmor - like expression relating energy - flux ( radiation ) and the acceleration of the sources is still missing .",

    "+   + as we shall see , this will lead to profound modifications in planar electrodynamics with respect to the ( 3 + 1)d maxwell theory .",
    "for example , by virtue of the failure of huyghens principle , electromagnetic signals reverberate in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , and a larmor - like formula for the radiated power appears to be a highly non - trivial task . +   + next , by taking a single point - like charge , @xmath27 , we get the general form for its potential ( we have omitted the homogeneous part of the potential ) : a^_ret(x)= + _ -^+ ( x^0 -z^0 ( s ) ) ^(s ) ds , [ asol ] with @xmath28 $ ] .  the expression for the field - strength is also obtained in the usual way , and reads ( with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) : f_(x)=^+_-ds.[fsol ] here , it is worthy noticing that , in general , we do not get to solve the expressions above .",

    "the scenario is quite different , because we have a @xmath31 ( instead of @xmath32 ) which , in turn , implies in a straightforward factorisation of the integral in @xmath33-variable , by picking up only those points for which @xmath34 .",
    "+   + hence , we conclude that the `` lack '' of closed analytic expressions for @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) in the case of an arbitrary motion ( linard - wiechert - type expressions ) is deeply related to the failure of the huyghens principle , since the solutions to the @xmath35-operator in ( 2 + 1)d , @xmath21 , do not satisfy such a principle ( indeed , the same happens for any @xmath36 , @xmath37 even .",

    "[ fest ] . here , we notice that , besides the well - known @xmath39-behaviour of the potential in planar electrodynamics , there is an extra term which explicitly diverges .",
    "such a term clearly represents the asymptotic value of the potential as @xmath40 and is directly related to the _ infrared divergence _ of the theory .  indeed , by calculating @xmath41 by means of @xmath42 ( its fourier transform )",
    ", we may clearly see that such a term arises when the mass term is set to zero , as below : a^0(,t)=+_0^ dp= _ 0_+k_0()-||- _ 0_+(/2 ) .",

    "the explicitly divergent term appearing in the @xmath2 above may be removed by a suitable subtraction procedure , which is possible because such a quantity vanishes asymptotically .",
    "[ among others , such subtleties shall be more explicitly discussed in ref.@xcite ] .",
    "+   + it is interesting to pay attention to the appearance of such an infrared divergence at the classical level ; indeed , infrared problems in ( 2 + 1)d are much more severe than in 4 dimensions . for example",

    "( [ fsol ] ) , there remains an interesting issue to be pointed out .  by taking into account the terms proportional to the acceleration , @xmath44 , which are those that effectively contribute to the energy - flux and so , to a larmor - like formula",
    ", we notice that such terms are proportional to @xmath45 , and might surprisingly lead us to the result that radiation in ( 2 + 1)d no longer falls off with @xmath46 .",
    "indeed it may increase proportionally to @xmath47 , as long as @xmath48 depends on @xmath49 , which is the case for constant accelerated motions . +   + next , let us point out a rather peculiar characteristic of the model as long as the propagation of electromagnetic signals is concerned .",
    "let us start by considering the charge configuration : @xmath50 .",
    "its potential reads : _",
    "pulse(,t)= , [ phipulse ] in contrast with its ( 3 + 1)d - counterpart @xmath51 . clearly ,",
    "although such a signal has been sharply sent ( at @xmath52 it was just at @xmath53 ) it can not later be recorded as a sharp one : the pulse develops a `` tail '' ( its spreading in time ) and so it reverberates.therefore , we now need a _ very long time to record _ a sharp signal sent at an earlier time .",
    "next , we obtain the superposed case , which is got from @xmath54 and reads : _ sup(,t)=+ ( ) ( t-||),[phisup ] whence we see that these signals superpose in a logarithmic way , differently from the ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions , where such a superposition takes place linearly , @xmath55 .",
    "+   + the logarithmic superposition leads us to an interesting point if we compare with previous results when @xmath56 is equal or slightly greater than @xmath57 : while the single pulse potential , eq .",
    "( [ phipulse ] ) , appears to be very strong , the contrary happens to the superposed case , which is very weak there .",
    "however , as time goes by , things straighten up : while single pulses fall off , their superposition appears to broaden the potential .",
    "[ the expressions for the electric field are also easily obtained and exhibit similar phenomenon concerning reverberation , while the superposition is `` better - behaved '' than the @xmath58-potential ] .  moreover ,",
    "notice that as ( and only as ) @xmath59 , we recover the static potential , eq .",
    "( [ aest ] ) .",
    "+   + thus , the results discussed above bring an additional complication to the ( classical , at least ) electrodynamics of a system of interacting charges , since even single pulses emitted by an electric charge will demand a very long time to be completely ` _ felt _ ' by another one .  in other words , even the static feature of the potentials and fields",
    "_ will be no longer _ determined only by the static configuration of the charges .",
    "it rather demands a very long time to actually happen , since at finite times the electromagnetic quantities are time - dependent . +   + indeed , in ( 2 + 1)d , we may regard the classical propagation of a signal as if the wave - front travels with velocity @xmath60 , and decreasing in a such a way that the back point of the signal has null - velocity ( this is exactly what eq .",
    "( [ phipulse ] ) says ) . +   + actually , similar conclusions concerning the reverberation of signals were already discussed by other authors @xcite .",
    "for instance , courant and hilbert in their classical book@xcite analyse such a propagation and , by virtue of the failure of the huyghens principle , they conclude that dalembertian waves ( in general ) , even if sharply produced , can not be later recorded with the same sharpness .",
    "+   + furthermore , we would like here to raise a question in view of what we have understood about the spreading that unavoidably affects the classical propagation of sharp signals in ( 2 + 1)d .  by facing an electromagnetic signal rather as a wave",
    ", reverberation affects its propagation and we can no longer speak of sharp pulses ; on the other hand , if we are to give the electromagnetic signal the status of a particle , we wonder whether the concept of photon as a localised energy packet should not be reassessed in the framework of planar electromagnetism .",
    "+   + * ii ) maxwell - chern - simons model * +   + let us write the lagrangian for the maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics ( mcs ) : _ mcs=-14 f_f^ + ^a__a_+j_a^[lcs ] , where @xmath61 is the ( abelian ) chern - simons term , which provides a mass for the boson , @xmath1 , without breaking the original local gauge symmetry of the action @xcite , @xmath62 . moreover ,",
    "the mass parameter , @xmath63 , may be taken to be positive or negative .  depending on the choice of its signal",
    ", the ` massive photon ' will carry polarisation equal to + 1 ( @xmath64 ) or -1 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "notice , however , that in both cases , massless or massive , the `` photon '' carries _ only one physical degree - of - freedom _ , which highlights its ` scalar nature ' .",
    "actually , since its mass is given by means of a topological mass term , we do not expect to have any additional degree - of - freedom .",
    "+   + in a similar way to the massless case , @xmath1-potential can be worked out and reads as below : a^(x)=d^2 + 1yj_(y)[amcs ] , where the massive green function is given by:@xmath66\\cos\\left(m\\sqrt{t^2 -r^2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{t^2 - r^2 } } \\theta[\\pm\\ , t].\\]]with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we clearly see that , as @xmath69 , then @xmath70 .",
    "similarly to its massless counterpart , @xmath71 does not satisfy the huyghens principle : again , the support spreads throughout the whole region @xmath72 .",
    "+ next , the general expression for @xmath1 , as produced by a single point - like charge , takes the form : & a^(x)=&+",
    "-^+_- ds(x^0-z^0(s ) ) \\{^+ .",
    "+ & & .+^ } [ acs ] , from which we may notice the difficulties which arise in trying to solve it for arbitrary motions of the charge ( indeed , the general solution to such an expression deeply depends on the massless one ) .",
    "there is also a new sort of term , not present in the massless case , which is explicitly acceleration - dependent ( a radiation - like term , the last one in the eq .",
    "above ) . such a term , in turn , will lead to another one that explicitly depends on @xmath73 in the expression for @xmath2 : a back - reaction - like term .  by virtue of its length",
    ", we shall not give the explicit form for this field here .",
    "we refer the reader to ref.@xcite , where a detailed derivation of the results above will be presented .",
    "we only anticipate that the possibility that the radiation increases like a @xmath47 also takes place here .",
    "+   + even though a general solution for @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) for arbitrary motions appears to be far off our possibilities , it is instructive to work out static quantities which already exhibit some of the new properties brought about by the chern - simons term .",
    "they read as follows : & & a^(x)=\\ {          .. [ fmcsest ] now , we see that @xmath1 acquires a better asymptotic behaviour : @xmath74 as @xmath75 ( at large distances , @xmath76 and @xmath77 roughly behave as @xmath78 ) .",
    "indeed , even the long - range sector of @xmath79 now decreases as @xmath80 .",
    "such a sector is related to the well - known non - dynamical massless pole and also to the possibility of topological objects such as vortex - like magnetic field .",
    "in addition , due to the chern - simons term , the charge now produces a non - vanishing static magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , this does not lead to radiation at all .",
    "indeed , it is easily to show that @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the poynting vector .",
    "+   + we should now comment on the short - distance behaviour of these quantities .  by recalling that , for @xmath83 , the modified bessel functions behave as @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    ", we see that , near the charge , @xmath58 and @xmath86 diverge as @xmath87 while @xmath88 blows up as @xmath80 .",
    "the vector potential , on the other hand , exhibits a very peculiar behaviour : it vanishes as @xmath89 !",
    "such a result is actually in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ amcs ] ) : the @xmath90 components should vanish as @xmath91 .",
    "+   + moreover , the fact that , as @xmath92 , @xmath93 implies that a charge within the chern - simons framework is a richer object than within a pure maxwell context : along with its massive electric field , it also produces a flux `` tube '' of magnetic field , of width @xmath94 and strength @xmath95 ( what demands @xmath63 to be suficiently large ) .",
    "it is precisely in this non - vanishing character of @xmath86 that there lies the possibility of the fractional statistics exhibited by such ` charges ' @xcite . +   + furthermore , it is easy to conclude , using eq .",
    "( [ amcs ] ) for example , that upon @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath88 remains unchanged while @xmath79 and @xmath86 changes their signals .",
    "+   + next , we shall treat the propagation of signals in the maxwell - chern - simons framework .",
    "we shall start by obtaining and analysing the single pulse case , which is produced by @xmath50 .",
    "the quantities read ( we have omitted @xmath98 in all expressions below ) : & & _ pulse(,t)=+ , [ phimcssingle ] +   + & & a_pulse^i(,t)=-^ij_j ( ) , for the potentials , while the fields are : & & e_pulse^i(,t ) = + ^i ( ) + ^ij _ t_j ( ) + & & b_pulse(,t)= -^2_x ( ) .the reverberation of the pulse is evident : it is very strong when @xmath56 is equal or slightly greater than @xmath57 and decreases as time goes by , vanishing as @xmath59.the superposed case is obtained by integrating expressions above from @xmath57 to @xmath56 .",
    "for example , the scalar potential superposes as : & & _ sup(,t)=^t _ || ( , ) d=+ ^t _ || d , [ phimcssup ] here , a new result takes place in the mcs framework : we can not exactly evaluate how electromagnetic signals superpose for arbitrary cases ( say , finite times ) , since the integral above is not available , in closed form , unless @xmath59 ( the other electromagnetic quantities also depend on the same integral ) .  at this limit , we get ( see , for example , ref .",

    "its remarkable angular ( instead of being radial ) dependence leads to a very interesting ( static ) electric field ( @xmath106 , as usual ) : ( x , y)=+ ( r,)=+ .[etang ] whence , we clearly see the announced property of the @xmath107-monopole : it yields a ( static ) tangential electric field .",

    "thus , we may identify a `` duality '' between both objects : the vortex is obtained from the monopole ( more precisely , from its `` string '' -see below ) by taking the electric field and the charge of the first to be respectively the vector potential and the magnetic flux associated to the latter .",
    "+   + on the other hand , it is a well - known fact that in ( 2 + 1)d the ` worldline ' of a monopole is reduced to a point in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional space - time ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ; see also ref .",

    "as far as we have seen , such a non - conservation imposes an intricate coupling between the coordinates , what implies in serious difficults towards analytical resolution of the differential equations .  a typical plot of the motion ( @xmath116-coordinates ) of the charged particle is shown in fig .",
    "1.by virtue of the tangentially repulsive nature of the electric field , the particle is quickly drifted away , despite the signals of the charges .",
    "+   + a further system which deserves more attention is that in which we also have the presence of an external ( constant , for concreteness ) magnetic field .",
    "a realistic planar system may be obtained at very low temperatures ( around or less than 1k ) and suficiently strong magnetic field ( at least 10 t ) perpendicular to a very thin plate .",
    "such a perpendicular field is got by taking a vector potential entirely confined to the 2d - spatial plane , for example , @xmath117 ( landau gauges ) or still @xmath118 ( symmetric gauge ) . +   + now , our present system is composed by the electric charge subject to the external magnetic and to the tangential electric field as well .",

    "such a requirement may be viewed as the counterpart of the dirac - veto in ( 3 + 1)d : a single charge moving under the action of the magnetic monopole field could not cross the string of its associated vector potential@xcite . [ in addition , such a requirement will impose ( see @xmath123-limit below ) severe restrictions on the asymptotic wave solutions ] . +   + thus , what remains to be determined is how quickly @xmath149 vanishes as @xmath150 .",
    "nevertheless , contrary to the @xmath123-limit , in which the hamiltonian gets separable ( see below ) , here the variables are not navely separated .",
    "this arises because @xmath151 is one of the leading terms , similarly to the original problem , described by the hamiltonian ( [ hrfi ] ) .",
    "[ in this sense numerical techniques could help us in order to get some information about the @xmath128-system as @xmath150 , say , the form of the wave - functions and eigenvalues ] .",
    "+   + ii)@xmath123 : supposing that the canonical momenta remain finite in this limit , we get : h(r,)_r(p^2_r + q^2b^2_0 r^2)+p_-,[hrinfty ] in which the variables appear explicitly split , say , @xmath152 .",
    "thus , at this limit , we have that ( the limit @xmath123 is implicit hereafter ) ( h|(r,)>)=(e_n|(r,)>)(h^r + h^)|r(r)())>=((e^r + e^)|r>),[eigenrfi ] which leads us to : h^r r_k(r)=e^r_kr_k(r ) h^_l()=e^_l_l ( ) .[hrhfi ] therefore , as @xmath123 , we get the following set of differential eqs . : & & ^2r + ( 2 m e^r -q^2b^2_0r^2)r=0 , [ rlarge ] + & & i+(^+)=0,[rlargefi ] with @xmath153 and @xmath154 . +   + we notice that , at this limit , the radial part of the hamiltonian reduces to that of one central harmonic oscillator , whose solutions may be written in terms of hermite polynomials , @xmath155:@xmath156with @xmath157 .",
    "this implies the well - known eigenvalues @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "now , by virtue of the requirement @xmath148 , only the @xmath160 solutions will survive .",
    "this implies in a non - vanishing value for the lowest ( renormalised ) energy level , @xmath161 .",
    "+   + on the other hand , the angular sector appears to be quite unusual .  indeed , by solving the differential equation in @xmath133 ,",
    "we readily obtain _ l()=_0 exp .",
    "[ phidefi ] it is worth noticing the new @xmath162-like phase factor , along with the usual linear one . as a first remark , we should stress that it can not be removed by any suitable gauge tranformation ; indeed , it must rather be faced as a consequence of the @xmath133-like scalar potential .",
    "although quite unusual , it leads us to new and interesting results .",
    "first , notice that @xmath163 has periodicity @xmath164 .",
    "thus , the requirement that @xmath58 be single - valued , i.e. , continuous , is equivalent to set 2(+^_l)=2le^_l = e^_0 + l.[angleeing ] now , if we identify the parameter @xmath165 as the number of windings @xmath114 gives around @xmath107 ( for example , in the counter - clock - wise sense ) , then @xmath165 shall be taken as a non - negative integer ( indeed , the negative values would be associated to the clock - wise sense ) . therefore , the eigenvalues associated to the angular variable feel whether it is running between @xmath166 and @xmath167 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , and so forth .",
    "in other words , whenever @xmath133 is shifted , say , by @xmath167 , its associated eigenvalues respond to this change by shifting up their values .",
    "+   + however , before completing a winding around @xmath107 , @xmath114-particle would have vanishing energy , since @xmath169 .",
    "it is precisely here that @xmath170 enters : since @xmath171 is a classical value , the lowest ( angular ) energy level of @xmath114-charge is non - vanishing . in other words , since the angular potential is acting on @xmath114 , it is expected that , by conservation of energy , this charge has non - vanishing ( also angular ) kinetic energy , as long as it has started its motion .",
    "this is the reason why there appears an @xmath171 with an intrinsically classical nature .",
    "+   + the results above may be viewed as a quantum analogue of eq .",
    "( [ v2angulo ] ) .",
    "for example , the fact that @xmath172 be given by the full angle ( including many windings ) is now represented by parameter @xmath165 ; and the initial kinetic energy , @xmath173 ( which may be classically set to zero ) ` survives ' at quantum level , but acquiring a intrinsic non - vanishing value .",
    "+   + moreover , we could be tempted to naively apply @xmath144-operator on @xmath174 above , to get@xmath175 and hence , to guess that @xmath174 carry continuous angular momentum .",
    "however , this is not a legitimate procedure , because @xmath174 are not eigenvectors of @xmath144 ( recall that @xmath139\\neq0 $ ] ) .  actually , as far as we have seen , the only two quantities which may be simoutaneously diagonalised in @xmath174-basis are @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( the components of the asymptotic hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hrinfty ] ) ) . +   + clearly , the results and remarks above are strictly valid only at the asymptotic limits specified previously .",
    "whether similar scenario does happen at arbitrary distances ( as the classical result ( [ v2angulo ] ) does ) , remains to be studied and will be strongly dependent on the separation of variables in the original hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hrfi ] ) . + a naive analysis of the limits discussed above would lead us to conclude that , since the charged particle is repelled from the origin by the @xmath133-potential and since as @xmath123 its dynamics reduces to that of one central harmonic oscillator ( whose wave - functions fall off exponentially ) , it is expected that the system yields physical bound states .  therefore , even though the pure @xmath128-system does not admit bound states ( once that the confining @xmath178-type potential is absent , for this case , in eq.([hrinfty ] ) , we get indeed a radially free particle ) , when it is supplemented by a suitable external magnetic field , the possibility for such states may be raised .",
    "+   + nevertheless , when electrons are moving on the plane subject only to a perpendicular magnetic field , then the choice of landau gauge immediately reduces the quantum problem to that of one harmonic oscillator in one dimension , and a free particle motion in the other direction . in this case , we can not have bound states .",
    "when the system is supplemented by an extra , say , scalar potential ( as in the present case ) , it is also well - known that bound states show up , even in the case of repulsive potential@xcite .  here",
    ", we have just raised such a question , and a precise answer demands further investigation .",
    "+   + * v ) conclusion and prospects * +   + we have shown that classical ( 2 + 1)d maxwell and maxwell - chern - simons electrodynamics present some interesting novelties as compared to maxwell theory in ( 3 + 1)d , namely , the reverberation of signals and the far - from - trivial question of a larmor - like formula .",
    "as we have seen , such phenomena are intimately related to the failure of the huyghens principle .",
    "namely , the latter is very difficult to be obtained even for constant accelerated motions ( parabolic and hyperbolic ones ) .",
    "the integrals involved are highly non - trivial and appear to diverge , so demanding some suitable regularisation scheme .  on the other hand , we hope that some hints about such a larmor formula could be obtained with the help of numerical calculations .",
    "next , as a natural extension of our present results , we shall pursue an investigation of the canonical quantisation of the electromagnetic radiation for the models contemplated here @xcite .",
    "+   + concerning the dirac - like monopole , it also presents some new properties whenever compared to its ( 3 + 1)d - counterpart ; for instance , its static tangential electric field .",
    "furthermore , acting on a single charged particle , it leads us to interesting classical and quantum results .",
    "for example , the @xmath128-system ( with @xmath127 ) has been shown to give rise , at least asymptoticaly and at non - relativistic regimes , to a central harmonic oscillator , with an interesting angular sector which contributes to the energy - eigenvalues . +   + as future prospects , solutions to the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hrfi ] ) in its general form shall be the object of a further investigation @xcite .",
    "it woul be also of relevance to compute possible effects of this peculiar potential on spin particles , for instance , planar dirac fermions .",
    "moreover , by virtue of its peculiar scalar potential ( and unusual consequences ) , such a monopole could be relevant to condensed matter problems .",
    "for instance , by looking at this object as a sort of impurity ( scatter ) within a sample , could its presence modify the hall conductivity ? and eventually , how would such a modification actually look like ? +   +       +   + the authors are grateful to prof .",
