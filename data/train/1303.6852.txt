    "in quantum turbulence , energy dissipation in the zero temperature limit is a central open question .",
    "@xcite in the absence of quantized vortices helium superfluids behave like an ideal eulerian fluid : with zero viscosity , no turbulent boundary layer is formed and the fluid exerts no drag on solid surfaces .",
    "the appearance of quantized vortices breaks this ideal behavior and in many cases the superfluid then behaves quasi - classically , similar to a classical viscous fluid . in classical fluids",
    "the energy dissipation arises due to the viscosity . in quantum fluids",
    "vorticity is quantized in units of the circulation quantum . here a hydrodynamic cascade , reminiscent of the kolmogorov - richardson cascade of classical hydrodynamics , can be expected to be effective only down to length scales of the order of the intervortex distance.@xcite at smaller scales a kelvin wave cascade on individual vortex lines is assumed to be the dominant dissipation mechanism , which transfers energy to scales where it can eventually be dissipated via microscopic processes .",
    "@xcite the existence and properties of the kelvin wave cascade have been discussed for two decades , but no firm experimental proof has yet been provided .",
    "reconnections play an important role in the energy cascade , especially at length scales of the order of the intervortex distance , where the energy is transferred from three - dimensional hydrodynamic motion to one - dimensional kelvin waves propagating along a line vortex.@xcite in simulations a reconnection between two almost anti - parallel vortices has been shown to start a cascade of vortex loop generation,@xcite which has been argued to be the dominant dissipation mechanism for a sparse tangle in the low - temperature limit.@xcite in fact , evaporation of vortex loops from a localized vortex tangle has been suggested even more generally to be responsible for the decay of turbulence at zero temperature.@xcite analytically such a decay has been analyzed using a gaussian model for vortex loops@xcite , which resulted in a diffusion like equation for the vortex line density and which is supported by recent simulations@xcite .    at not too low temperatures",
    "mutual friction is the dominant dissipation mechanism , caused by the scattering of quasiparticles from the vortex cores . at a reconnection event",
    "a vortex becomes strongly distorted and locally large velocities appear on the curved vortex , giving rise to substantially increased mutual friction dissipation .",
    "previously the dissipation enhancement has only been evaluated for the viscous normal component using the coupled equations where the normal component is affected by the motion of the line vortex.@xcite    these different possible mechanisms for energy dissipation in quantum turbulence motivated us to evaluate the extra dissipation induced by a single reconnection event .",
    "we use the vortex filament model . it does not capture the microscopics of the reconnection event on the length scale of the vortex core diameter .",
    "instead our calculation examines the consequences from the reconnection event to the overall dynamics , by concentrating on larger length scales , i.e. , those which extend from the typical inter - vortex distance two or three orders of magnitude lower to the resolution limit of our computation .",
    "we determine the increase in mutual friction dissipation after the reconnection event and find that a reconnection excites kelvin waves whose mutual friction damping increases the direct energy loss .",
    "this loss appears to be roughly temperature independent .",
    "no formation of small new evaporating vortex loops is observed , nor any cascading of energy to smaller length scales .",
    "finally , no large change , similar to the energy loss from the reconnection event , is seen in the dissipation of angular momentum .",
    "these features appear to be consistent with recent experimental observations.@xcite    the results can not be directly generalized to the decay of dense vortex tangles .",
    "a single reconnection calculation might overestimate dissipation in a tangle where reconnections are frequent and where there is not enough time for mutual friction to dissipate all energy before the next reconnection occurs .",
    "this problem becomes more pronounced at the lowest temperatures , where the decay time increases .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations underline the importance of the direct mutual friction losses in kelvin wave excitations on approaching the zero - temperature limit , which is of central current interest in the field of quantum turbulence .",
    "in the vortex filament model@xcite all characteristic length scales are assumed to be much larger than the vortex core radius , @xmath4 , which in superfluid @xmath5he is only of order 0.1 nm . within the vortex filament model",
    "the superfluid velocity , @xmath6 , is given by the biot - savart law .",
    "at zero temperature the only force felt by the vortex is the classical magnus force given by @xmath7 ( per unit length ) , where @xmath8 is the velocity of the vortex segment at point @xmath9 on the vortex , with the unit vector @xmath10 pointing in the tangential direction . here",
    "@xmath11 = 0.0997",
    "mm@xmath12/s is the circulation quantum for superfluid @xmath5he .",
    "since the mass of the vortex core can typically be neglected , every point on the vortex simply moves at its local superfluid velocity : @xmath13 following schwarz@xcite , the singularity in the biot - savart integral has here been removed , by extracting out the local term ( the first term on the right - hand side ) . here @xmath14 are the lengths of the line segments connected to point @xmath9 after discretization and @xmath15 denotes the normal at @xmath9 , where the derivation is with respect to the arc length @xmath16 . in the second nonlocal term the line integral is taken over the other vortex segments , not connected to @xmath9 .    at finite temperatures vortex motion",
    "is coupled via mutual friction to the motion of the normal component . the mutual friction force ( per unit length ) acting on the vortex is given by @xmath17 where @xmath0 and @xmath18 are temperature - dependent and pressure - dependent mutual friction coefficients , whose values are rather well known in superfluid @xmath5he and @xmath2he - b .",
    "( note that the results for this paper are calculated with @xmath18 = 0 , which is approximately valid at low temperatures . )",
    "thus at finite temperatures the velocity of the vortex segment is given by @xmath19 the power dissipated by mutual friction can be calculated from @xmath20 if we assume that the normal fluid is at rest , @xmath21 , then we obtain @xmath22 the negative sign , which is typically omitted in the analysis below , indicates that energy is dissipated .",
    "since the mutual friction provides the only dissipation , which is considered here ( in addition to numerical dissipation ) , the power can also be calculated from the rate of change in the kinetic energy of the superfluid component . however , at small @xmath0 values fluctuations in the dissipation complicate the calculation of the time derivative and we prefer to calculate @xmath23 from eq .",
    "( [ e.pmf0 ] ) . in calculating the energy ( @xmath24 ) ,",
    "momentum ( @xmath25 ) , and angular momentum ( @xmath26 ) we use the following line integrals@xcite : @xmath27    in the filament model a reconnection must be introduced by hand . however , its existence is supported by gross - pitaevskii calculations@xcite and recently also by experiments@xcite .",
    "our method of making a reconnection follows that of other authors .",
    "@xcite traditionally one reconnects two vortices as soon as any two points approach closer than some given distance .",
    "this critical distance is typically taken to be of the order of the resolution .",
    "we not only calculate the distances between the different vortex points on a vortex , but also keep track of the minimum distance between two vortex segments .",
    "( between neighboring points the vortex is assumed to be straight , which is the standard assumption in the filament model . )",
    "this distance can be smaller than the distance between two adjacent points on the same vortex .",
    "thus this reconnection procedure ensures good accuracy also in an adaptive point separation scheme , where the point separation is adaptive , being much larger at locations where the local radius of curvature is large .    in these simulations",
    "the point separation is not adaptive , but is simply kept between @xmath28 , and a reconnection is made if any two segments get closer than @xmath29 , provided that the vortex length decreases in the reconnection event . roughly speaking this procedure",
    "ensures that the energy decreases .",
    "numerically it might not always be evident that the energy @xmath24 decreases in the reconnection ( see , e.g. , the peak in fig.[f.epalatt0 ] ) , since the large curvatures and small distances complicate the accurate calculation of @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for avoiding an adaptive point discretization scheme , even if it would speed up the calculation , is to minimize numerical errors : always when a point is added or removed the energy @xmath24 is changed by a small amount .",
    "the point adjustment is done much more frequently in an adaptive scheme .",
    "clearly , the error could be eliminated by developing an energy conserving algorithm for adding or removing points .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    one should note , however , that a numerical scheme , where the energy is too well conserved , might lead to a numerical bottleneck near the resolution limit .",
    "this bottleneck would appear if the ( kelvin wave ) cascade becomes important in transferring energy from large scales to scales which can not be resolved . in the calculation",
    "this would appear as a fractalization of the vortex configuration , with the characteristic curvatures being of the order of the numerical resolution .",
    "this is not the case here : even our zero - temperature calculations do not show any signs of accumulation of the smallest scale structures .",
    "for instance , with a resolution @xmath31 mm the calculation gives an average curvature @xmath32mm@xmath33 which remains roughly constant from soon after the reconnection up to 70s later .",
    "this we take as one of the indications that the kelvin wave cascade is not triggered by a single reconnection event , or that the cascade is too small to be observed ( in accordance with baggaley and barenghi@xcite , but in contrast to kivotides _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that even if we use @xmath5he specific parameters , the results are also valid for superfluid @xmath2he - b . the slightly different value for the circulation and different core size can only change the numerical values by a factor that is close to unity .",
    "our starting configuration is two linked planar vortex rings , with radius @xmath34 = 1 mm , separated by a distance @xmath35 , and with their planes oriented perpendicular . the initial configuration , together with some time development ( at @xmath36 = 0 , where @xmath0 = @xmath18 = 0 ) , is illustrated in fig .  [ f.confst0 ] .",
    "the final configuration is one single closed loop .",
    "no additional small vortex rings are formed as a result of the reconnection ; i.e. , no evaporation of extra vortex loops is observed . with closed loops , we can conveniently evaluate the characteristics of the vortex configuration from the line integrals in eqs.([e.epa ] ) .",
    "figure [ f.epalatt0 ] illustrates that the energy and linear and angular momentum are all well conserved in this calculation at @xmath36 = 0 , and that the typical numerical error is smaller than 0.1% .",
    "this implies that our numerical error is well smaller than the losses appearing in our finite - temperature simulations .",

    "the most important observation from the finite - temperature calculations with @xmath39 is that energy dissipation is strongly increased by the kelvin waves appearing immediately after the reconnection , while momentum and angular momentum dissipation are barely affected .",

    "the dissipation of @xmath26 is barely affected by the reconnection and the dissipation of @xmath25 is slightly reduced .",
    "the rapid fluctuations near @xmath44 are likely numerical artifacts , since these features depend more sensitively on the chosen resolution @xmath38 , while the overall behavior does not .    the explanation for the weak momentum dissipation is the following : the sharp kinks created in the reconnection event induce kelvin waves , but due to conservation of linear and angular momentum the kelvin waves on different sides of a kink must have opposite helicities ( the @xmath45 vector of the kelvin waves is directed away from the kink ) .",
    "even if the change in momentum is finite on both sides on the original kink , the total change of momentum is zero because the changes have opposite signs .",

    "the main problem in analyzing the reconnection in the vortex filament model is to extract the asymptotic behavior before and after the event , which we do by subtracting a `` background '' dissipation power to which the reconnection does not contribute .",
    "well before reconnection , the dissipation is caused by the shrinking of the two independent vortex rings . here",
    "analytical estimation gives a good approximation .",
    "however , immediately after the reconnection the situation is more complex . the late time configuration is close to a single vortex ring , with a larger radius compared to the value of the initial rings , but which eventually shrinks away . note that during these simulations the total length has dropped 20% or less . in the following , to extract the extra dissipation from the reconnection , we make use of the fact that the time scale related to the simple shrinking of the two initial rings ( or the final perturbed ring ) is much longer than the time scales related to the decay of the small scale structures ( kelvin waves ) which are induced by the reconnection event .",

    "our calculations have been performed on two reconnecting vortex rings with initial radii of mainly 1 mm .",

    "the large enhancement of the mutual friction dissipation becomes understandable if one calculates the mutual friction dissipation power @xmath23 using theoretically predicted kelvin spectra .",

    "their spectrum can be argued to take a similar slope @xcite as the theoretically predicted steady - state spectrum@xcite , and therefore dissipation is strongly increased .",
    "recently a similar dissipation enhancement has been found in simulations considering a decaying vortex inside a cylinder.@xcite these authors concluded that the larger dissipation at the lowest temperatures was due to a transfer of vortex length in consecutive reconnection events to surface - pinned remanent vortex loops trapped on the cylinder wall .    as seen in fig.[f.dissipepa ]",

    "recent works on the propagating and precessing vortex front in rotating superfluid @xmath2he - b , both nmr measurements and vortex filament calculations,@xcite show that this feature might be valid more generally .",

    "in fact , it is possible that the angular momentum dissipation might even vanish in these measurements in the limit of zero temperature , if pinning or surface friction can be entirely excluded .",

    "this is consistent with the ideas presented by svistunov about the relaxation of the vortex angle.@xcite accurate identification of kelvin waves on a nontrivial configuration of vortices is not a simple task and can lead to unexpected errors.@xcite this results from the fact that generally kelvin waves are not well defined , except in the case of a straight vortex or a simple planar ring , and more sophisticated analysis is required .",
    "our simple case of two reconnecting vortex rings indicates that the kelvin waves excited in a reconnection event are efficient in dissipating energy , but are much less efficient in dissipating angular momentum .",
    "the increased energy dissipation is not due to a kelvin wave cascade , which transfers energy from large length scales to small scales ( owing to nonlinear coupling between kelvin waves of different scales ) .",
    "rather the enhanced dissipation is caused by the direct transfer of energy from the excited kelvin waves to the normal fluid by mutual friction damping .",
    "our numerical estimates for the extra mutual friction dissipation indicate that a single reconnection event can dissipate energy to an amount which in our example case corresponds to a few percent of the vortex length , an unexpectedly large value which additionally is almost temperature independent .",
    "in turbulent vortex tangles dissipation per reconnection event is expected to be smaller , because it is likely limited by the time between reconnections , the inter - vortex distance , vortex polarization , etc . at still lower temperatures than considered here , where @xmath91 , for mutual friction to dissipate all the reconnection energy , the required time diverges . in this limit",
    "the kelvin wave cascade might become a more dominant dissipation mechanism , as believed today .",
