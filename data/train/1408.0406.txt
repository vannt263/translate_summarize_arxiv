    "online social platforms routinely track and record a large volume of event data , which may correspond to the usage of a service ( , url shortening service , bit.ly ) .",
    "these events can be categorized roughly into _ endogenous _ events , where users just respond to the actions of their neighbors within the network , or _ exogenous _ events , where users take actions due to drives external to the network .",
    "for instance , a user s tweets may contain links provided by bit.ly , either due to his forwarding of a link from his friends , or due to his own initiative to use the service to create a new link .",
    "can we model and exploit these data to steer the online community to a desired activity level ?",
    "specifically , can we drive the overall usage of a service to a certain level ( , at least twice per day per user ) by incentivizing a small number of users to take more initiatives ?",
    "what if the goal is to make the usage level of a service more homogeneous across users ?",
    "what about maximizing the overall service usage for a target group of users ?",
    "furthermore , these _ activity shaping _ problems need to be addressed by taking into account budget constraints , since incentives are usually provided in the form of monetary or credit rewards .",
    "activity shaping problems are significantly more challenging than traditional influence maximization problems , which aim to identify a set of users , who , when convinced to adopt a product , shall influence others in the network and trigger a large cascade of adoptions  @xcite .",
    "first , in influence maximization , the state of each user is often assumed to be binary , either adopting a product or not  @xcite .",
    "however , such assumption does not capture the recurrent nature of product usage , where the frequency of the usage matters .",
    "second , while influence maximization methods identify a set of users to provide incentives , they do not typically provide a quantitative prescription on how much incentive should be provided to each user .",
    "third , activity shaping concerns about a larger variety of target states , such as minimum activity requirement and homogeneity of activity , not just activity maximization .    in this paper",
    ", we will address the activity shaping problems using multivariate hawkes processes  @xcite , which can model both endogenous and exogenous recurrent social events , and were shown to be a good fit for such data in a number of recent works ( ,  @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , we will go beyond model fitting , and derive a novel predictive formula for the overall network activity given the intensity of exogenous events in individual users , using a connection between the processes and branching processes  @xcite . based on this relation ,",
    "we propose a convex optimization framework to address a diverse range of activity shaping problems given budget constraints .",
    "compared to previous methods for influence maximization , our framework can provide more fine - grained control of network activity , not only steering the network to a desired steady - state activity level but also do so in a time - sensitive fashion .",
    "for example , our framework allows us to answer complex time - sensitive queries , such as , which users should be incentivized , and by how much , to steer a set of users to use a product twice per week after one month ?",
    "in addition to the novel framework , we also develop an efficient gradient based optimization algorithm , where the matrix exponential needed for gradient computation is approximated using the truncated taylor series expansion  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm allows us to validate our framework in a variety of activity shaping tasks and scale up to networks with tens of thousands of nodes .",
    "we also conducted experiments on a network of 60,000 twitter users and more than 7,500,000 uses of a popular url shortening service .",
    "using held - out data , we show that our algorithm can shape the network behavior much more accurately .",
    "we model the events generated by @xmath0 users in a social network as a @xmath0-dimensional counting process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 records the total number of events generated by user @xmath3 up to time @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , we represent each event as a tuple @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the user identity and @xmath7 is the event timing .",
    "let the history of the process up to time @xmath4 be @xmath8 , and @xmath9 be the history until just before time @xmath4 .",
    "then the increment of the process , @xmath10 , in an infinitesimal window @xmath11 $ ] is parametrized by the intensity @xmath12 ,  , @xmath13 = \\lambdab(t ) \\ , dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] intuitively , the larger the intensity @xmath14 , the greater the likelihood of observing an event in the time window @xmath15 $ ] . for instance , a poisson process in @xmath16 can be viewed as a special counting process with a constant intensity function @xmath17 , independent of time and history . to model the presence of both endogenous and exogenous events",
    ", we will decompose the intensity into two terms @xmath18 where the exogenous event intensity models drive outside the network , and the endogenous event intensity models interactions within the network .",
    "we assume that hosts of social platforms can potentially drive up or down the exogenous events intensity by providing incentives to users ; while endogenous events are generated due to users own interests or under the influence of network peers , and the hosts do not interfere with them directly .",
    "the key questions in the activity shaping context are how to model the endogenous event intensity which are realistic to recurrent social interactions , and how to link the exogenous event intensity to the endogenous event intensity .",
    "we assume that the exogenous event intensity is independent of the history and time ,  ,  @xmath19 .",
    "recurrent endogenous events often exhibit the characteristics of self - excitation , where a user tends to repeat what he has been doing recently , and mutual - excitation , where a user simply follows what his neighbors are doing due to peer pressure .",
    "these social phenomena have been made analogy to the occurrence of earthquake  @xcite and the spread of epidemics  @xcite , and can be well - captured by multivariate hawkes processes  @xcite as shown in a number of recent works ( ,  @xcite ) . more specifically , a multivariate hawkes process is a counting process who has a particular form of intensity .",
    "more specifically , we assume that the strength of influence between users is parameterized by a sparse nonnegative _ influence matrix _",
    "@xmath20}$ ] , where @xmath21 means user @xmath22 directly excites user @xmath23 .",
    "we also allow @xmath24 to have nonnegative diagonals to model self - excitation of a user .",
    "then , the intensity of the @xmath23-th dimension is @xmath25 } a_{uu ' } \\int_{0}^t g(t - s ) \\ , dn_{u'}(s ) ,    \\label{eq : hawkes - intensity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a nonnegative kernel function such that @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; the second equality is obtained by grouping events according to users and use the fact that @xmath30 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath31 models the propagation of peer influence over the network  each event @xmath32 occurred in the neighbor of a user will boost her intensity by a certain amount which itself decays over time .",
    "thus , the more frequent the events occur in the user s neighbor , the more likely she will be persuaded to generate a new event .    for simplicity",
    ", we will focus on an exponential kernel , @xmath33 in the reminder of the paper . however , multivariate hawkes processes and the branching processed explained in next section is independent of the kernel choice and can be extended to other kernels such as power - law , rayleigh or any other long tailed distribution over nonnegative real domain .",
    "furthermore , we can rewrite equation   in vectorial format @xmath34 by defining a @xmath35 time - varying matrix @xmath36}$ ] .",
    "note that , for multivariate hawkes processes , the intensity , @xmath14 , itself is a random quantity , which depends on the history @xmath37 .",
    "we denote the expectation of the intensity with respect to history as @xmath38"
