    "ngc  185 and ngc  205 are unique in being among the the closest early - type galaxies ( @xmath0 1 mpc ) that have a neutral interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "they are small galaxies ( luminosities of a few @xmath1 l@xmath2 ) , and they are called dwarf ellipticals or dwarf spheroidals in order to distinguish them from  regular \" or  giant \" ellipticals which follow a different luminosity - size relation ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "their proximity means that we can image their ism at resolutions of @xmath350  pc and better , on the scales of individual molecular clouds .",
    "individual stars can be resolved , and color - magnitude diagrams provide information on the star formation history of these galaxies and their inventory of young massive stars ( e.g. martinzez - delgado in this volume ; peletier 1993 ; lee et al .",
    "1993 ; lee 1996 ) .",
    "thus , in ngc  185 and ngc  205 we can probe the star - gas ecosystem in detail that simply is nt possible with any other early - type galaxy .",
    "such observations give valuable perspective on how the ism works in an environment unlike the spirals we are familiar with ; they also give clues to the origin and evolution of the gas in early - type galaxies .",
    "for many years it has been known that ngc  185 and ngc  205 contain dust , which is visible in optical images ( hodge 1963 , 1973 ) .",
    "recent radio observations show that they also contain a few @xmath4 m@xmath2 of atomic and molecular gas ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ stars+hi ] shows the distributions of hi in these galaxies .",
    "all of the neutral ism is centrally concentrated and is found within 450 pc ( for ngc  205 ) or 180 pc ( for ngc  185 ) of the centers of the galaxies . in this respect ,",
    "the ism of the dwarf ellipticals is significantly different from the neutral gas in ellipticals , a topic which will be discussed further in the next section .",

    "the mass of the interstellar medium in ngc  185 and ngc  205 is , in the following sense , typical .",
    "ngc  185 and ngc  205 have hi mass - to - blue luminosity ratios of about @xmath14 .",
    "both knapp et al . ( 1985 ) and huchtmeier et al . (",
    "1995 ) find that substantial numbers , perhaps half , of all ellipticals contain hi with an m(hi)/l@xmath5 ratio of @xmath14 or higher .",
    "of course , the relationship between the interstellar media of dwarf ellipticals and giant ellipticals is poorly understood because the number of dwarf ellipticals with detected hi is so small , and because dwarf and giant ellipticals may have had different evolutionary histories .",
    "hi synthesis observations of elliptical galaxies provide vital clues to the origin of the neutral gas in those galaxies .",
    "the hi in ellipticals is typically highly extended with respect to the optical galaxies and is rotating ( van gorkom 1992 and references therein ; see also morganti in this volume ) .",
    "the stars in these galaxies have much lower angular momenta per unit mass than the gas does .",
    "these facts constitute the most important pieces of evidence that the neutral gas in elliptical galaxies probably has an external origin ( was captured in an interaction ) , as opposed to an internal origin ( stellar mass loss ) .",
    "velocity fields of the hi in ngc  185 and ngc  205 are presented by young & lo ( 1997 ) . in the case of ngc  205",
    ", the elongated gas distribution appears to be rotating at 20 km  s@xmath15 about its minor axis .",
    "the stars are not rotating , with an upper limit of 2 km  s@xmath15 from observations out to 150  along the major axis at @xmath1615@xmath17 ( bender et al .",
    "1991 ) . as in the case of giant ellipticals ,",
    "the kinematics of the hi are inconsistent with the kinematics of the stars .",
    "the gas in ngc 205 may also have had an external origin ; on the other hand , sage et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have argued that it may have had an internal origin and been torqued by some interaction with m31 .",
    "the velocity field of ngc  185 shows no sign of rotation .",
    "in fact , the hi in ngc  185 is distributed in a handful of distinct clumps which appear to be moving with disordered velocities with a dispersion of 14 km  s@xmath15 ( young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "the stars also do not appear to be rotating ; they have a velocity dispersion of 22 km  s@xmath15  ( bender et al . 1991 ; held et al . 1992 ) .",
    "thus the kinematics of the hi in ngc  185 are _ consistent _ with the kinematics of the stars , suggesting that ( barring some perverse inclination effects ) an _ internal origin _ should be considered for the gas in ngc  185 .",
    "it has long been expected that stellar mass loss should contribute some significant amount of gas to the ism of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. faber & gallagher 1976 ) . using faber & gallagher s mass loss rate , it would have taken only @xmath18 years to accumulate the ism in ngc  185 from stellar mass loss .",
    "we speculate that the neutral ism in these dwarf ellipticals is related to the hot ( x - ray emitting ) ism in giant ellipticals in this way : the stellar mass loss in a giant elliptical can be heated to x - ray temperatures by the velocity dispersion of the stars .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersions are much lower in dwarf ellipticals , and perhaps the stellar mass loss could remain neutral .",
    "the molecular clouds in ngc  185 and ngc  205 are very similar to galactic giant molecular clouds . figures  [ 185dust ] and [ 205dust ] present images of co emission , dust , and hi in the dwarf ellipticals .",
    "the molecular clouds in the dwarf ellipticals have diameters about 60 pc , line widths ( @xmath19 ) of 38 km  s@xmath15 , and therefore virial masses of @xmath20 ( young & lo 1996 , 1997 ) , which are similar to galactic clouds ( e.g. blitz 1993 ) .",
    "the molecular clouds in these figures are associated with hi clumps , most probably photodissociated envelopes around the molecular gas , and with dust clouds of extinction @xmath21 mag .",
    "observations of the northern molecular cloud in ngc  205 , made with the iram 30 m telescope ( young 1998 ) , have detected @xmath22co  2 - 1 , @xmath22co  1 - 0 , and @xmath23co  1 - 0 , and provide upper limits for hcn  1 - 0 and hco+  1 - 0 .",
    "the line ratios indicate optically thick , thermalized co emission from gas at moderate density , again very typical of galactic molecular clouds .",
    "an unexpected property of the ism in ngc  185 and ngc  205 is the remarkably low hi column densities only a few @xmath24 @xmath25  @xmath26 and less .",
    "when molecular clouds are observed in our own galaxy , they are associated with hi column densities of about @xmath27 @xmath26 ( blitz 1993 ; savage 1977 ) .",
    "similar effects are observed in m31 ( lada et al .",
    "the most common conclusion is that in our galaxy and m31 , an hi column density of about @xmath27  @xmath26 is necessary to shield molecular gas against the dissociating interstellar uv field .",
    "the hi column densities in ngc  185 and ngc  205 would seem to be too low to allow molecular gas to form .",
    "however , they can be explained by theoretical models of photodissociated regions ( e.g. draine & bertoldi 1996 ) , if the ratio of the interstellar uv field ( in units of the habing field ) to the hydrogen volume density is around @xmath28 or lower . in comparison ,",
    "a value of 0.05 is estimated for the galactic star formation region ngc  2023 , which is illuminated by only one early b star ( draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "we have no good density estimates in the dwarf ellipticals",
    ". however , welch et al . ( 1996 , 1998 ) estimate the interstellar uv fields in ngc  185 and ngc  205 , and they find that the fields are probably a factor of 10 to 100 lower than the solar neighborhood uv fields .",
    "the molecular clouds in ngc  185 and ngc  205 thus provide enlightening comparisons with the ism in our own spiral galaxy .",
    "in section  [ kinematics ] we speculated that the neutral ism in ngc  185 and ngc  205 may have an internal origin .",
    "this speculation in turn suggests that a large fraction of these kinds of early - type galaxies , especially in the field or in loose groups , could have significant amounts of neutral gas .",
    "consideration of the molecular cloud properties in ngc  185 and ngc  205 also suggests that the transformation of neutral gas into stars may be easier than we thought , both in dwarf and in giant ellipticals .",
    "the conditions within elliptical galaxies are not likely to be the same as the conditions within spiral galaxies .",
    "hi column densities which , by the standards of our galaxy , are thought to be too low to support star formation , might not actually be too low .",
    "paul eskridge i d like to clarify once more that ngc  185 and ngc  205 are not elliptical galaxies .",
    "they define the bright end of the l@xmath5concentration relation that extends down to the galactic halo dwarf spheroidals , not the relation that is defined by bright ellipticals .",
    "young table  [ table1 ] contains the best current estimates of dust and gas masses in the dwarf ellipticals .",
    "here s another comparison : for the darker optical dust patch in ngc  185 , price ( 1985 ) estimates a peak a@xmath29 of 1.6 mag .",
    "the total hydrogen column density at this point is a few @xmath30 nuclei  @xmath26 .",
    "paul goudfrooij there are a number of bright young stars in the center of ngc  205 .",
    "did you try to evaluate the uv radiation field from those stars to check that it is indeed significantly lower than in a typical galactic star - forming region ?",
    "young yes , welch s estimates ( welch et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) include both the young stars and the old stars .",
    "the component from the old stars is scaled from observations of ngc  1399 .",
    "the young massive stars contribute some uv radiation , but they are not tremendously massive .",
    "i think they are b stars .",
    "gary welch those calculated uv radiation fields depend very much on unknown geometry and on the assumed effective temperatures of the young stars , which are poorly known .",
    "also , if the radiation fields are low as we think they are , there might also be a significant mass of diffuse molecular gas which is not associated with known optical dust clouds .",
    "we have recently published nrao 12 m co(1 - 0 ) observations which seem to show such gas .",
    "the total mass could exceed that inside the optical dust clouds , but the detections need to be confirmed ."
