    "let @xmath0 be a lie group and @xmath1 be a vector space on which @xmath0 acts by a left action .",
    "given these ingredients , we may form the lie group @xmath2 , which is isomorphic to @xmath6 as a set , but equipped with the composition @xmath7 a standard example of a system which evolves on a left semi - direct product is the heavy top , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath0 acts on @xmath1 by a right action , we may form the right semi - direct product @xmath3 defined by the composition @xmath10 a standard example of such a system is a fluid with a vector - valued advected parameter @xcite . in any case , it seems natural to surmise that the composition law @xmath11 yields a new type of semi - direct product .",
    "the first result of this article is that is a valid composition law in some circumstances , where the resulting group is dubbed a _ centered semi - direct product_.    the second result is that the 2nd order taylor expansions ( or @xmath5-jets ) of diffeomorphisms over a fixed point is a centered semi - direct product . the main motivation behind understanding this example is to allow us to develop particle - based methods for fluid simulation , with applications ranging from medical imaging to simulation of complex fluids .",
    "the semi - direct product is a standard tool used in the construction of new lie groups and plays an interesting role in geometric mechanics when the normal subgroup is interpreted as an advected parameter .",
    "a standard example is the modeling of the ` heavy - top ' , wherein the configuration space is the left semi - direct product @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another standard example is the modeling of liquid crystals , in which we consider the right semi - direct product @xmath13 . in this case",
    ", @xmath14 is the set of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms of a volume manifold @xmath15 , and @xmath1 is a vector space of lie algebra valued one - forms on @xmath15 upon which @xmath14 acts by pullback @xcite .",
    "of course , the tangent bundle of a lie group , @xmath16 , is isomorphic to a left semi - direct product @xmath17 by left - trivializing the group structure of @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , @xmath16 is isomorphic to a right semi - direct product @xmath18 when the group structure of @xmath16 is right trivialized ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see  5.3 ) .",
    "thus , we see that this method of constructing groups can be found in a number of instances . in this article , we introduce a new type of semi - direct product which extends the existing semi - direct product theory .",
    "a motivating example will be a desire to understand the jet - groupoid of a manifold @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , it is known that the jet - functor sends the diffeomorphism group to a groupoid known as the jet groupoid ( * ? ? ? * see  12 ) . as will be illustrated in  [ sec : jets ] , the isotropy groups of the jet groupoid for @xmath5-jets have a group structure which can be written as a centered semi - direct product .",
    "a thorough understanding of the jet groupoid can be useful for the creation of new particle - based methods wherein the particles carry jet data in addition to position and velocity data .",
    "the advantage of such a particle method is the possibility for a discrete form of kelvin s circulation theorem @xcite .",
    "building such particle methods can be useful in scenarios in which one desires to work with the material representation of a fluid .",
    "this occurs in the image registration method known as ` large deformation diffeomorphic matching , ' which is used in the field of computational anatomy @xcite .",
    "moreover , the potential energy associated with the advected parameters in complex fluids is often a function of certain gradients which require jet data in order to be advected by a diffeomorphism .",
    "thus , keeping track of jet data may play a significant role in the construction of particle - based variational integrators .      in this paper",
    ", we accomplish a sequence of goals , each building upon the previous .",
    "in particular :    1 .   in section [ sec : csd ] , we define a new type of semi - direct product that we dub a _ centered semi - direct product_. 2 .   in proposition [",
    "prop : algebra ] , we derive the lie algebra of a centered semi - direct product and its associated structures .",
    "3 .   in section",
    "[ sec : ep ] , we develop the euler - poincar theory of centered semi - direct product in parallel with the existing theory of semi - direct product reduction @xcite .",
    "4 .   in section",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we describe the centered semi - direct product euler - poincar equations for a few examples .",
    "we present one toy example before presenting the theory for an isotropy group of the 2-jet groupoid .",
    "combined , these items allow for a computationally tractable algebraic understanding of @xmath5-jets and perhaps open the door to applications which were previously overlooked by geometric mechanicians .",

    "this allows us to write the lie group structure of @xmath59 as a type of semi - direct product .",
    "in particular :    [ prop:2jets ] if we represent @xmath40 and @xmath60 as @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , then @xmath65 is given by the composition @xmath66    we find that @xmath67 and the second derivative is @xmath68 noting that @xmath69 we can set @xmath70 and rewrite the equations in the form @xmath71 therefore if we define the composition @xmath72 on the manifold @xmath73 , then @xmath74 is a lie group isomorphism by construction .",
