    "while there are lots of cosmological evidence of the dark matter in the universe @xcite , its detailed properties remain largely undetermined .",
    "requirements for the dark matter particle are the following .",
    "( 1 ) it reproduces the present matter density of the universe . in terms of the density parameter , @xmath0 must be satisfied where @xmath1 is the hubble parameter in units of 100  km / s / mpc @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) it is electrically neutral .",
    "( 3 ) it is cold , which means that its free - streaming length ( @xmath2 ) is not so long as to seed the structure formation satisfactory , and this requires @xmath3  mpc .",
    "in fact many candidates of dark matter are proposed in the framework of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "in particular , supersymmetry ( susy ) provides interesting candidates .",
    "if @xmath4-parity is conserved , the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) becomes stable and contributes present matter density of the universe . among susy particles , the gravitino and ( lightest ) neutralino are possible candidates of the lsp dark matter . from the viewpoint of detection possibility ,",
    "the gravitino dark matter is undesirable because its interaction strength with ordinary matter is planck - suppressed . in the following",
    "our focus is the neutralino dark matter , which may have distinct signatures of direct and/or indirect detection .",
    "usually neutralinos are assumed to be produced thermally as in the following scenario @xcite . in the early universe with temperature @xmath5  tev ,",
    "susy particles including neutralinos are thermalized and their number density is given by @xmath6 .",
    "as the temperature decreases , their thermal abundance receives boltzmann suppression factor and eventually they decouple from thermal bath at the freeze - out temperature @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the lsp mass . after that the number density of the lsp per comoving volume remains constant until now and hence contributes as dark matter of the universe .",
    "the resultant abundance of the lsp is estimated as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the annihilation cross section of the lsp and @xmath11 is the reduced planck scale @xmath12  gev ) .",
    "however , such a thermal relic scenario does not always hold in realistic susy models .",
    "for example , there often exists polonyi or moduli field in order to break susy and gives rise to correct order of gaugino masses .",
    "those singlet scalar fields generally have long lifetime and decay after freeze - out of the lsp , yielding substantial amount of lsps .",
    "actually polonyi / moduli dominate the universe before they decay , and hence reheat the universe again with very low reheating temperature of @xmath13  mev-@xmath13  gev depending on their masses @xcite .",
    "in this case a large amount of lsps are produced non - thermally by the polonyi / modulus decay , and hence large annihilation cross section is needed to account for the present dark matter abundance .",
    "therefore , taking into account nonthermal production mechanism may significantly change the properties of the lsp and its direct / indirect detection signatures .",
    "thus in this paper we study direct / indirect detection signatures of non - thermally produced neutralino dark matter . as for direct detection , there are some ongoing and planned projects devoted to detect scattering signals of the lsp with nucleons such as cdms @xcite and xenon @xcite . as for indirect detection , many possible ways are proposed .",
    "first , neutralinos accumulated in the galactic center annihilate each other and produce line and continuum gamma rays .",
    "such gamma - ray signals can be searched by satellite experiments ( glast @xcite ) or ground - based cerenkov telescope ( hess @xcite , magic @xcite , cta @xcite ) .",
    "second , anti - matter such as positrons or anti - protons are produced by the annihilation of the neutralinos .",
    "since these particles are diffused by galactic magnetic fields during their propagation to the earth , we need to solve its propagation in a diffusion model to discuss their flux on the earth @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the positron flux is less sensitive to the precise diffusion model since magnetic fields easily dissipates their energy through the propagation and positrons come only from near the earth .",
    "these anti - matter signals can be detected pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite .",
    "third , neutralinos trapped in the sun annihilate and produce high - energy neutrinos .",
    "super kamiokande @xcite , amanda @xcite , icecube @xcite and planned km3net @xcite experiments search high energy muon signals , which arise from high - energy neutrino interaction with earth matter .",
    "we investigate characteristic signals of nonthermal neutralino dark matter on these experiments .    for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we stick to two susy breaking models : minimal anomaly - mediated susy breaking model @xcite and mirage - mediation model @xcite .",
    "the former model predicts the wino - like neutralino lsp in broad parameter regions .",
    "since the wino - like neutralino with a mass of @xmath14 gev has too large annihilation cross sections , its thermal abundance becomes too small to account for the present dark matter abundance .",
    "hence we need to consider some non - thermal production processes of the neutralino dark matter .",
    "the latter model contains a heavy modulus field and non - thermal production of the neutralino dark matter is expected naturally .",
    "as we will see later , the large annihilation cross section of the neutralino dark matter is a general feature of non - thermal production scenario , and hence our results are less sensitive to the model construction .",
    "a similar subject was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was pointed out that the large annihilation cross section of the neutralino yields enhancement of the anti - matter signals .",
    "we emphasize that such an enhancement is rather generic feature when considering the nonthermal production scenario of the dark matter , and its detection may be directly related to the early universe cosmology , in particular , the existence of late - decaying particles and their decay temperature .",
    "also we have performed more detailed parameter analyses both in the anomaly - mediated susy breaking and mirage - mediation models , including the gamma - ray signature as well as anti - matter searches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nt ] we review some non - thermal production mechanisms of the neutralino dark matter .",
    "the minimal anomaly - mediated susy breaking model and the mirage - mediation mode are taken as examples . in sec .",
    "[ sec : detection ] detection possibilities of nonthermal dark matter are discussed .",
    "these include direct detection using recoil of nuclei by the neutralino , gamma - ray flux from the neutralino annihilation at the galactic center , positron flux from the annihilation near the earth , and high energy neutrino flux from the annihilation in the sun .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "for calculating these direct / indirect detection rates , we have utilized darksusy code @xcite .",
    "the lsp neutralino is often referred to as a promising candidate of the dark matter of the universe .",
    "although the standard thermal relic scenario is often assumed , the production processes of the neutralino are not limited to it in general .",
    "in particular , non - thermal production processes may be relevant for estimating the present dark matter abundance .",
    "actually we often encounter the cosmological scenarios which include long - lived matter .",
    "if the long - lived matter has non - negligible fraction of the total energy density at the time of its decay , neutralinos emitted by its decay processes may amount to significant contribution to the dark matter abundance @xcite . here",
    "we present examples of such late - decaying matter .    _",
    "( 1 ) gravitino : _ the gravitino is the superpartner of the graviton and its interaction strength is suppressed by the planck scale or susy breaking scale .",
    "gravitinos are efficiently produced in the early universe thermally @xcite or non - thermally by the nlsp @xcite and/or inflaton decay @xcite .",
    "its thermal abundance is given by @xmath15 \\\\    & \\times \\left [ 1- 0.028\\ln \\left ( \\frac{t_r}{10^{10}~\\rm{gev}}\\right ) \\right ] ,    \\label{gravitinotp } \\end{split}\\ ] ] for a heavy gravitino where @xmath16 is the gravitino mass and @xmath17 is the reheating temperature of the universe defined as @xmath18 with the total decay rate of the inflaton @xmath19 .",
    "if the gravitino is unstable , it decays at later epoch after the freezeout of the lsp . in the case of heavy gravitino ( @xmath20  tev )",
    "as is realized in anomaly - mediated susy breaking , it decays well before bbn begins without affecting the success of bbn , and produces lsp non - thermally .",
    "the lifetime of the gravitino is estimated as @xmath21 if the gravitino is the heaviest among mssm particles .",
    "depending on the reheating temperature , the abundance of non - thermally produced lsps by the gravitino decay can exceed that of thermally produced ones .",
    "_ ( 2 ) polonyi field : _ a polonyi field is a singlet scalar responsible for susy breaking .",
    "a polonyi field is always required in gravity - mediation models in order to generate sizable gaugino masses . however ,",
    "generically polonyi has the mass ( @xmath22 ) of order of the gravitino ( @xmath16 ) and its interaction is planck - suppressed .",
    "thus decay of the coherent oscillation of the polonyi causes cosmological disaster , unless polonyi decays well before bbn or it is diluted by some additional entropy production processes .",
    "the polonyi field begins to oscillate when the hubble parameter become equal to the polonyi mass , and its abundance is estimated as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the initial amplitude of the polonyi field . here",
    "@xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "if the polonyi mass is larger than @xmath28  tev , it decays before bbn begins .",
    "the lifetime is estimated as @xmath29 in general , polonyi field also decays into susy particles and their abundance may be bigger than the thermal relic one @xcite . thus we must take into account the abundance of the lsp arising from the polonyi decay .    _ ( 3 ) moduli : _ modulus field is a scalar field appearing in the low energy effective theory of string theory when the extra dimensions are compactified .",
    "properties and their cosmological effects are similar to those of the polonyi @xcite . in some particular models",
    "the modulus mass is related to the gravitino mass .",
    "for example , in kklt setup described below , @xmath30 is obtained .",
    "in such a case the decay temperature of the modulus can be as large as @xmath31  gev @xcite , although gravitinos produced by the modulus decay may cause another cosmological difficulty @xcite .    _",
    "( 4 ) saxion : _ in susy extension of the axion models , there exists an additional light scalar degree of freedom , which obtains a mass from susy breaking effect , called saxion ( @xmath32 ) @xcite . the saxion mass is naturally expected to be @xmath33 and its interaction strength is suppressed by the peccei - quinn scale @xmath34gev ) .",
    "saxions are produced in the early universe via the coherent oscillation and their decay process affects cosmology @xcite .",
    "its coherent oscillation contribution is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is initial amplitude of the saxion and @xmath25 is defined analogously to the polonyi case . if we assume that the main decay mode is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the gluon , the lifetime is estimated as @xmath39 if the saxion is heavier than the lsp , decay modes into lsps or susy particles become open and they give significant fraction of the relic lsp density @xcite .",
    "axino , which is the fermionic superpartner of the axion , may also produce large amount of lsps by its decay , if unstable @xcite .    _",
    "( 5 ) q - ball : _ q - ball is a non - topological soliton whose stability is ensured by a global u(1 ) symmetry @xcite . in susy ,",
    "flat direction condensates ( called affleck - dine field ) can develop to large field value during inflation and coherent motion of the affleck - dine ( ad ) field can create observed amount of baryon asymmetry @xcite . through the dynamics of the ad field , fluctuation of the ad field develops if its potential is flatter than the quadratic one and then it fragments into solitonic objects , q - balls @xcite . here",
    "the global u(1 ) charge required to stabilize the q - ball configuration is baryon number .",
    "assuming that the ad field begins to oscillate at @xmath40 with amplitude @xmath41 , the q - ball charge ( @xmath42 ) is estimated as @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a numerical constant and @xmath45 is called ellipticity parameter which is smaller than one . in the case of ad baryogenesis using flat directions lifted by non - renormalizable superpotential @xmath46 with cutoff scale @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48 . thus the charge of q - ball becomes @xmath49 once a q - ball is formed , its lifetime is determined by the charge of q - ball @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the mass of the ad field and @xmath52 is a model dependent constant which can take the value @xmath53-@xmath54 .",
    "on the other hand , the abundance of q - ball is given by @xmath55 thus decay of q - balls yields significant amount of lsps non - thermally @xcite , and they can even dominate the universe before the decay @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this model can explain the present dark matter abundance and baryon asymmetry simultaneously by the q - ball decay .",
    "all the above models predict decay temperature of order 0.1 - 1  gev typically , which is smaller than the freeze - out temperature of lsp . in this case",
    "the non - thermally produced lsp abundance may exceed the thermal relic one .",
    "thus it is important to reconsider the abundance of the lsp produced by the decay of those long - lived matters .",
    "hereafter we collectively denote such a long - lived matter as @xmath56 . the following arguments",
    "do not depend on the detailed properties of @xmath56 once the decay temperature of @xmath56 is fixed .",
    "now let us write down the boltzmann equations which govern the evolution of the number density of the lsp , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 denotes the number density of the lsp and late - decaying particle ; @xmath10 denotes thermally averaged annihilation cross section of the lsp ; @xmath60 denotes the radiation energy density ; @xmath8 denotes the lsp mass ; @xmath61 denotes the branching fraction of the @xmath56 decay into lsp or susy particles ; and @xmath62 denotes the hubble parameter .",
    "this set of equations is simplified for @xmath63 after @xmath56 decays , @xmath64 this equation can easily be solved and the resulting abundance of lsp is simply given by @xmath65^{-1 } ,   \\label{ynt}\\ ] ] where we have defined number - to - entropy ratio as @xmath66 with entropy density @xmath67 . the initial abundance after @xmath56-decay",
    "@xmath68 under sudden decay approximation is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the branching ratio of @xmath56 into lsps and @xmath71 denotes the contribution from thermal freezeout , taking into account the dilution from @xmath56-decay .",
    "if the annihilation cross section is sufficiently small or the initial abundance of the lsp is negligible , lsps can not annihilate each other after @xmath56 decays .",
    "however , if the annihilation cross section is large enough , the lsp abundance becomes inversely proportional to the annihilation cross section similar to the case of thermal relic abundance , @xmath72 the crucial difference is that larger annihilation cross section is required in order to account for the present dark matter density , because the decay temperature of @xmath56 is smaller than the typical freeze - out temperature of the lsp , @xmath73 .    in fig .",

    "dashed ( solid ) lines correspond to @xmath75 .",
    "left ( right ) ones correspond to @xmath76  gev . here",
    "we have taken @xmath74  gev . ]",
    "thus we are interested in models which predict large annihilation cross section . for concreteness ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to two susy breaking models : minimal anomaly - mediated susy breaking model ( mamsb ) and mirage - mediation model ( mmsb ) .",
    "the former model predicts the wino - like neutralino lsp , which has naturally large annihilation cross section compared with the case of bino - like neutralino . in the latter model",
    ", the annihilation cross section of bino - like neutralino lsp could be enhanced through @xmath77-channel resonance , as we will see .",
    "now let us briefly introduce these models .      in the anomaly - mediated susy breaking model ,",
    "the effect of susy breaking in the hidden sector sequestered from the observable sector is transmitted to the mssm sector through super - weyl anomaly effect . since the susy breaking effect is suppressed by a loop factor ,",
    "the gravitino becomes a few magnitude heavier than the susy particles .",
    "for example , gaugino masses are given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 s are gauge coupling constants for @xmath80 - 3 corresponding to u(1)@xmath81 , su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge groups .",
    "the beta function coefficients @xmath82 s are calculated as @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that the expression ( [ gaugemass ] ) is valid for all energy scale @xmath85 , not for only the input scale .",
    "thus it is seen that for weak scale gaugino masses , the gravitino mass can be as heavy as @xmath86  tev .",
    "one problem of such a scenario is that it predicts tachyonic slepton masses .",
    "thus in the minimal anomaly - mediation model , an additional universal scalar mass term @xmath87 is introduced to give positive contribution to the scalar masses , as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the beta functions of corresponding gauge and yukawa coupling , and @xmath91 with @xmath92 denoting the wave function renormalization . therefore this model is characterized by the following parameter set , @xmath93 where @xmath94 represents the ratio of vevs of up - type and down - type higgses . here and hereafter",
    "we assume @xmath95 because positive @xmath85 is favored from muon @xmath96 experiments .    in this framework",
    "the wino - like neutralino ( @xmath97 ) naturally becomes the lsp , as is easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ gaugemass ] ) .",
    "the annihilation process through @xmath98 is not helicity - suppressed and hence it has large annihilation cross section .",
    "the annihilation cross section of this process is calculated as @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the su(2 ) gauge coupling constant and @xmath101 denotes the @xmath102-boson mass .",
    "actually the wino mass should be @xmath103  tev to account for the dark matter density if it is produced in the standard thermal freeze - out scenario @xcite , and such a heavy lsp mass seems to be disfavored from the viewpoint of naturalness .",
    "however if we extend the production mechanism of the lsp to non - thermal origin , light wino mass of @xmath104gev is favored .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : am - tchi ] , we plot the reheating temperature of the @xmath56-decay , @xmath105 , in the ( @xmath106 ) plane with @xmath107 , assuming the present dark matter is produced by the decay of @xmath56 field . in the most parameter regions ,",
    "wino - like neutralino lsp is realized with the mass of @xmath108 .",
    "for larger @xmath109 , the higgsino mass becomes smaller and the lsp neutralino contains much higgsino components .",
    "thus , too large values of @xmath109 are excluded by the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking , and the higgsino - like lsp is realized near the boundary . as can be seen from this figure , we expect non - thermal production with @xmath110 for the neutralino dark matter with the mass of @xmath111 .     in order to reproduce correct dark matter abundance and @xmath112 for the minimal anomaly - mediation model .",
    "red thick solid lines represent @xmath113  gev from left to right .",
    "dot - dashed lines show the lightest higgs mass @xmath114  gev and 120  gev and dashed lines correspond to @xmath115  tev from left to right respectively .",
    "upper left region is excluded from electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) constraint and lower right region predicts stau lsp or tachyonic slepton masses , and hence is excluded . ]",
    "the mirage - mediation models are based on recent developments on moduli - stabilization mechanism in string theory , that is , kklt construction @xcite .",
    "we denote the modulus as @xmath116 and assume the following type of k@xmath117hler potential , superpotential and gauge kinetic function ( hereafter we set @xmath118 unless explicitly written ) , @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes mssm superfields , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are real constant , and @xmath123 .",

    "an analysis shows that this potential has a supersymmetric anti - de sitter ( ads ) minimum . thus in order to obtain de sitter ( ds ) vacuum consistent with current cosmological observations , the additional uplifting potential is needed .",
    "this is provided by , for example , adding an extra brane which is sequestered from the observable brane .",
    "the additional term is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is @xmath13 constant .",
    "thus total scalar potential is given by @xmath129 .",
    "after fine - tuning the value of @xmath130 , the desired ds minimum is obtained .",
    "phenomenologically this model provides a characteristic pattern of susy breaking effect .",
    "susy is dominantly broken by the uplifting term introduced to make the vacuum energy positive , which becomes a source of anomaly - mediation effect . on the other hand the modulus @xmath116 has non - vanishing @xmath131-term ( @xmath132 ) at the resulting vacuum , which becomes a source of modulus - mediation effect .",
    "thus a mixture of anomaly- and modulus mediation is realized , called mixed modulus - anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these two effects are comparable in general , that means @xmath133 .",

    "the modulus field is likely to dominate the universe due to its large energy density stored in the form of scalar condensates with a large initial amplitude of order the planck scale .",

    "we parametrize density profile of the galactic halo as @xmath188^{\\frac{c - a}{b } } } , \\ ] ] with @xmath189 corresponding to the distance from the galactic center .",
    "navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite corresponds to @xmath190 and isothermal profile corresponds to @xmath191 . if @xmath192 the profile shows cuspy structure at the galactic center and hence the annihilation rate is expected to be enhanced compared to cored profile .",
    "neutralino annihilation processes produce both monochromatic and continuum photons , and there are many studies related to this issue @xcite .",
    "the former originates from , e.g. , @xmath193 but we have found that branching ratio into these modes are small for interesting parameter regions . thus hereafter we concentrate on continuum gamma - ray flux coming from cascade decays of annihilation products , mainly from pion decays .    gamma - ray flux produced by the neutralino annihilation at the galactic center is expressed as @xcite @xmath194 where the integration is carried out over the line of sight and @xmath195 represents the differential number of photons with the energy @xmath196 produced by the neutralino annihilation .",
    "this expression shows that the density profile dependent part and particle physics model dependent part can be separated out .",
    "it is convenient to define the dimensionless quantity @xmath197 as @xmath198 and its averaged value over solid angle @xmath199 , @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "in fact the actual observations have some angular resolution @xmath199 and hence the gamma - ray flux from the galactic center should be integrated over the solid angle .",

    "( [ gammaflux ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath202 besides the annihilation cross section and the neutralino mass , the gamma - ray flux crucially depends on the dimensionless quantity @xmath203 , which is solely determined by the density profile of the dark matter halo .",
    "this is numerically calculated for each profile and solid angle . for the glast , @xmath204 and @xmath205 for the isothermal and nfw profiles",
    "respectively .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : am - gamma ] and [ fig : mm - gamma ] expected integrated @xmath25-ray fluxes from the galactic center @xmath206 are shown for mamsb and mmsb respectively .",
    "here the isothermal density profile is applied conservatively .",
    "green and red points correspond to @xmath207 and @xmath186 respectively , and blue points is @xmath208 . as is apparent from the figures",
    ", the gamma ray flux is inversely proportional to the reheating temperature because the same annihilation process is relevant both for the gamma ray signal and the non - thermal production of the dark matter .",
    "thus , large annihilation cross section required for non - thermal dark matter directly leads to enhancement of the gamma ray signal , and its detection possibility becomes increased compared to the case of thermally produced dark matter .",
    "glast can detect dark matter annihilation signals if @xmath209 .",
    "thus , in both cases , it seems difficult to find the gamma - ray signals for the cored profile such as the isothermal one .",
    "however , the flux becomes a few orders of magnitude larger for more cuspy profile , such as the nfw profile , and in that case glast may detect dark matter annihilation signals .",
    "to summarize , although the definite prediction is impossible due to large uncertainity of the density profile , there is large possibility to detect the signals from the neutralino dark matter produced non - thermally .",
    "similar to the gamma - rays described above , positrons are also yielded by the neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo . as opposed to the gamma - rays ,",
    "positrons lose their energy through the propagation in interstellar space due to the inverse compton processes and synchrotron radiation as bended by galactic magnetic fields .",
    "for this reason , high energy positrons can only come from the region within a few kpc around the earth .",
    "thus positron flux is insensitive to the density profile of the dark matter halo and implications of its detection on dark matter models are promising @xcite .",
    "propagations of positrons are described by the following diffusion equation , @xmath210+q(e ) , \\label{diffusion } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath211 denotes the positron number density per unit energy , @xmath196 denotes the energy of the positron in units of gev , @xmath212 is the diffusion constant , @xmath213 is the energy loss rate and @xmath214 is the source term coming from neutralino annihilation , given as @xmath215 where @xmath216 denotes the spectrum of the positron from single annihilation .",

    "the reason to use the positron fraction instead of the positron flux itself is that the effect of solar modulation , which is important for the low energy positron flux , is removed by taking the ratio .",
    "another important factor comes from the possible local inhomogeneity for the dark matter distribution in the galactic halo , characterized by the boost factor ( @xmath224 ) , which determines the overall normalization of the positron flux @xcite . here",
    "we conservatively assume @xmath225 , which means that the homogeneous distribution of the dark matter is assumed .",
    "[ fig : posflux ] shows typical positron flux for some model parameters of mamsb and mmsb .",
    "it is seen that for the case of mamsb , the peak signature will be observed .",

    "dark matter particles in the halo scatter off the nucleus in the sun , and then they are trapped and accumulate at the center through the lifetime of the sun . trapped neutralinos annihilate with the enhanced rate because of large number density of the neutralinos in the sun @xcite . the neutralino number accumulated in the sun ( @xmath246 ) evolves in a balance between trapped rate and the annihilation rate , as @xmath247 where @xmath248 denotes the annihilation rate with the volume of the sun @xmath249 and @xmath250 is capture rate by the sun , calculated as @xcite @xmath251 where @xmath252 and @xmath253 are local density and velocity of the dark matter around the solar system , @xmath254 and @xmath255 denote the scattering cross section of the neutralino with hydrogen and helium respectively , and superscript sd(si ) denote spin-(in)dependent component of them .",

    "rather , the annihilation rate is determined by the scattering cross section with nucleus .",
    "this is because the number density accumulated in the sun is saturated by the balance between the capture rate and the annihilation rate , and hence the latter is related to the former .",
    "once neutralinos annihilate in the sun , energetic neutrinos produced by the subsequent decay of annihilation products escape the sun and reach to the earth .",

    "the muon flux should be restricted below @xmath262 by the current experimental bounds , but almost all parameter region is free from this constraint .",
    "the expected sensitivity of icecube is around @xmath263 and only the higgsino - like neutralino in the mmsb model would be promising to be detected .",
    "the difference from the @xmath25-ray and positron signals described in the previous subsections is that the high - energy neutrino flux from the sun is not determined by the annihilation cross section of the neutralino , but by the scattering cross section of the neutralino with nucleons .",
    "since the scattering cross section is in general not correlated with relic abundance , neutrino - induced muon signals are not so enhanced even if non - thermal dark matter scenario is assumed .",
    "we have discussed direct and indirect detection signatures of neutralino dark matters produced non - thermally with a very low reheating temperature @xmath264 . in this scenario ,",
    "the self - annihilation cross section of dark matter should be large enough to account for the present relic abundance , within the rage consistent with bounds provided in @xcite . in susy models , such a large annihilation cross section",
    "is naturally realized for the neutralino dark matter with significant wino or higgsino components . in the case of bino - like neutralino",
    ", such a large annihilation cross section can be obtained by s - channel higgs resonance . in both cases",
    ", the large annihilation cross section leads to the enhancement of gamma - ray signals and the positron flux from the dark matter annihilation , and it becomes promising to detect the non - thermally produced dark matter with @xmath265 by these indirect detection experiments .",
    "in other words , the indirect detection experiments may give us clues to explore the history of the universe with the temperature up to @xmath266 .    obviously , the consideration with other observations is important and essential to make definitive conclusion about the non - thermal production scenario .",
    "for example , it is known that the large annihilation cross section of the lsp affects the big - bang - nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and non - thermally produced dark matter with @xmath267 may be severely constrained by the observation of @xmath268li abundance @xcite . and also the combination with collider experiments may be most important .",
    "the upcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments are expected to discover new particles relevant to the ewsb in the standard model , and there may appear dark matter candidates .",
    "once such a dark matter candidate is discovered , we may have insight on its production mechanism in the universe by comparing the theoretical calculation of the cross section with cosmological and astrophysical observations , such as the dark matter abundance and its direct and indirect detection signatures . as explained in this paper , large indirect detection signals are characteristic features for the non - thermally produced dark matter , and combined with lhc experiments we may probe the nature of dark matter by these experiments .    _",

    "@xcite was submitted to the preprint server , which studied similar subject to our present work .",
    "while they focus on non - thermally produced wino and higgsino like dark matter , we have also studied bino - like one in the s - channel resonance region , and performed detailed parameter analyses in mamsb and mmsb models .",
