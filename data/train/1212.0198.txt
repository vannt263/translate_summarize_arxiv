    "recently , there has been much interest in theoretical and experimental studies on trapped atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs)@xcite . the superfluid property of atomic becs arises from a dual aspect of waves and particles , i.e. , matter waves , and is theoretically described by the macroscopic wave function . because of the nonlinearity of the system caused by interaction between particles , the macroscopic wave function can take a form of various solitons such as bright , dark , grey , and vortex solitons , and these solitons are experimentally observed in becs .    as for bright solitons , martin _",
    "et al._@xcite theoretically predicted that the particle - like behavior of three bright solitons in a one - dimensional @xmath0rb bec was non - integrable and showed its change from regular motions to chaos .",
    "prez - garca _",
    "et al._@xcite applied a variational method to dynamics of bright solitons in a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) bec and showed that the center of mass of each soliton obeys newtonian dynamics and ehrenfest s theorem is valid if the phase of bec wave function will be suitably chosen .",
    "as more interesting systems , we can consider solitons in multi - component becs which consist of different kinds of atoms or same kinds of atoms having different spin and have been experimentally realized .",
    "in multi - component becs , there are not only intra - component particle interaction but also inter - component particle interaction which is another origin of nonlinearity , so we expect novel soliton dynamics which is not seen in single - component becs .",
    "et al._@xcite developed a variational method to describe bright soliton dynamics in 2-d multi - components becs , and proposed a model of conservative chaos . in 2-d and 3-d systems , however , bright soliton are unstable unless intra - component interaction oscillates between attraction and repulsion or coexisting intra - component quintic ( three - body ) interaction is strong enough .",
    "on the other hand , topological vortices known as quantized vortices , i.e. , topological defects of the macroscopic wave function can be stable in two dimensions .",
    "vortices in single - component @xcite and multi - component @xcite becs have been realized experimentally , giving a good candidate to study the dynamics of vortices in 2-d and 3-d becs .",
    "most of the theoretical studies , however , are limited to the thomas - fermi regime ( tfr ) in a single - component bec @xcite . while dynamics of the macroscopic wave function of bec is described by gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) in eq.([eq - gp ] ) below , tfr suppresses the kinetic energy part in gpe in the lowest approximation and therefore the lowest - order wave function can not have a healing length which is a hallmark of the vortex core .",
    "it is highly desirable to construct the effective theory of vortices beyond the tfr .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the vortices in 2-d multi - component becs beyond the thomas - fermi regime . to consider the effective dynamics of point - like vortices , we extract some degrees of freedom by using the variational approach , and derive an effective dynamics with finite degrees of freedom .",
    "for the case of a single - component bec without a trap , it is well known that the effective hamiltonian for many vortex systems has a standard form @xcite @xmath1 in the limit of infinitesimal vortex cores . here",
    "@xmath2 is the winding number of the @xmath3-th vortex , and @xmath4 is the distance between cores of @xmath3-th and @xmath5-th vortices .",
    "equation  ( [ eq - single - vortex - hamiltonian ] ) shows that there is no momentum degree of freedom , and coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 are formally conjugate each other . on the other hand , in the case of multi - component becs in a trap with each component having a single vortex , we shall see vortices acquire momentum degrees of freedom or inertia . a very preliminary idea of the present work",
    "was reported in the conference proceedings @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] , starting from the multi - component gpe , we apply the variational method with use of vortex solitons in the pad approximation , and derive the effective hamiltonian for vortices .",

    "there we see a chaotic behavior of the system consisting of three vortices .",
    "section  [ sec - conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section , we consider the trapped multi - component gpe with vortices and extract some degrees of freedom of vortex soliton by using a variational technique .",
    "bec at zero temperature is described by the gpe . we shall consider a 2-d system of trapped @xmath8-component macroscopic wave function @xmath9 satisfying the equations @xmath10\\phi_i(t , x , y ) , \\label{eq - gp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath11 . here the normalization condition for each component of wave functions is defined by @xmath12 after a proper rescaling of @xmath13 by the particle number @xmath14 common to all components .",
    "the effect of trapping is expressed by @xmath15 .",
    "equation ( [ eq - gp ] ) is expressed with use of scaled variables : using the confining length @xmath16 and oscillation period @xmath17 , space coordinates are scaled by @xmath18 , time by @xmath19 , wave function by @xmath20 , and nonlinearity by @xmath21 .",

    "the collective coordinates for a vortex are phase variables besides the coordinates of a vortex core .",
    "we shall use tvf beyond the thomas - fermi regime , by incorporating the effect of a kinetic energy in gpe in eq.([eq - gp ] ) : as for the amplitude of tvf , we choose a vortex function based on the pad approximation @xcite which is regularized due to a trap . as for its phase , we taylor - expand the phase with respect to space coordinates around the vortex core .",

    "<S> with use of the nonlinear schrdinger ( or gross - pitaevskii ) equation with strong repulsive cubic nonlinearity , dynamics of multi - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with a harmonic trap in 2 dimensions is investigated beyond the thomas - fermi regime . in the case </S>",
    "<S> when each component has a single vortex , we obtain an effective nonlinear dynamics for vortex cores ( particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the particles here acquire the inertia , in marked contrast to the standard theory of point vortices widely known in the usual hydrodynamics . the effective dynamics is equivalent to that of charged particles under a strong spring force and in the presence of lorentz force with the uniform magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - particle ( vortex - vortex ) interaction is singularly - repulsive and short - ranged with its magnitude decreasing with increasing distance of the center of mass from the trapping center . </S>",
    "<S> `` chaos in the three - body problem '' in the three vortices system can be seen , which is not expected in the corresponding point vortices without inertia in 2 dimensions . </S>"
