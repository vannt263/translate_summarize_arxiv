    "the discovery of the first accreting x - ray msp , sax j1808.43658 @xcite , provided compelling evidence for this evolutionary sequence ( see also * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",

    "the long - suspected evolutionary connection between lxmbs and radio msps was conclusively established when psr j18242452i in the globular cluster m28 was seen to switch between rotation - powered ( radio ) and high - luminosity accretion - powered ( x - ray ) pulsations @xcite .",

    "psrs j1023 + 0038 and psr j18242452i belong to the family of so - called `` redbacks '' ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , namely , eclipsing radio msps with relatively massive ( @xmath20.2 m@xmath3 ) non - degenerate companions that are ( nearly ) roche - lobe filling .",
    "these objects are distinct from `` black widow '' systems , which are bound to very low mass degenerate stars being ablated by the pulsar wind @xcite .",
    "extensive x - ray studies of redbacks in globular clusters @xcite and the field of the galaxy @xcite have revealed that the dominant source of x - rays from these binaries is non - thermal radiation with @xmath4 originating in an intra - binary shock @xcite generated by the interaction of the pulsar wind and matter from the companion star .",
    "the x - ray emission is strongly modulated at the orbital period in all redback systems , with a decline in flux when the secondary star is between the pulsar and the observer .",

    "therefore , the results obtained herein , and the recent radio pulsar discovery by @xcite further demonstrate that xss j122704859 is a redback , i.e. a compact binary with an active rotation - powered pulsar and no accretion disk .",
    "the non - thermal x - rays from redback systems are generated in an intra - binary shock formed by the interaction of the pulsar wind with material from the close companion star @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the decline in x - ray flux at @xmath87 seen in psr j1023 + 0038 can be reproduced by a simple geometric model in which the intra - binary shock is partially occulted by the bloated secondary star . in this scenario ,",
    "the depth and phase extent of the x - ray eclipse require that the shock be situated at or very near the surface of the secondary star on the side exposed to the pulsar wind .",
    "there is no indication of extended x - ray emission associated with xss j122704859 that could arise due to outflows in the lmxb phase or the interaction of the pulsar wind with the ambient medium .",
    "an adjacent diffuse source is likely not associated with the binary and is probably a background galaxy cluster .",
    "given that only two msps , psrs b1957 + 21 @xcite and j21243358 @xcite show evidence for x - ray bow shocks , the absence of nebular emission associated with xss j122704859 does not imply the lack of a pulsar wind .    the lack of knowledge of the orbital separation , the companion mass , and the pulsar spin - down luminosity ( @xmath88 ) for xss j122704859 , do not allow meaningful constraints on the physics of the intrabinary shock .",
    "nevertheless , given the nearly identical x - ray properties compared to other redbacks it is possible to place crude constraints on the energetics of the msp in xss j122704859 .",
    "in particular , if we consider that the shock luminosity at x - ray maximum is @xmath6@xmath89 for psrs j1023 + 0038 @xcite and j17232837 @xcite , the implied spin - down of the pulsar in xss j122704859 is @xmath90 erg s@xmath8 assuming a distance range @xmath73 kpc .",

    "* ) ) , this yields @xmath91 erg s@xmath8 , in general agreement with the limit obtained from the x - ray luminosity . continued timing of the radio pulsar would allow a determination of the true @xmath88 of this pulsar .",
    "the redback nature of the xss j122704859 binary determined from the x - ray analysis presented above implies that the pulsar should undergo radio eclipses of frequency - dependent duration around superior conjunction .",
    "these eclipses are caused by intra - binary plasma , presumably emanating from the companion star .",
    "for most redback and black widow systems that are detectable in radio pulsations , the radio emission is eclipsed for @xmath7650% of the orbit , although there is indication that for some systems this fraction can be close to 100% ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of psr j13113430 ) .",
    "the non - detections with the parkes telescope @xcite and only a single , brief detection with the gmrt @xcite despite deep pulsation searches , are indicative of a high radio eclipse fraction for xss j122704859 that likely varies from orbit to orbit .",
    "the large @xmath88 estimated above is consistent with this scenario , since an energetic wind would drive off material from the surface of companion at a higher rate than an msp with a lower @xmath88 .",
    "this may result in occasional severe enshrouding by this stripped material , causing the pulsar to be eclipsed at radio frequencies for a larger fraction of the orbit .",
    "this would make xss j122704859 a so - called `` hidden '' msp , as postulated by @xcite .    the x - ray properties of xss j122704859 in both the present disk - free radio pulsar state and the accretion disk - dominated state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are virtually identical to those of psrs j1023 + 0038 @xcite and j18242452i @xcite .",
    "this remarkable consistency in x - ray characteristics provides a powerful discriminant for identifying more such msp binaries , especially ones that are heavily enshrouded and hence can not be identified via radio pulsation searches .",

    "<S> we present _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations of the low - mass x - ray binary xss j122704859 , which experienced a dramatic decline in optical / x - ray brightness at the end of 2012 , indicative of the disappearance of its accretion disk . in this new state , </S>",
    "<S> the system exhibits previously absent orbital - phase - dependent , large - amplitude x - ray modulations with a decline in flux at superior conjunction . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emission remains predominantly non - thermal but with an order of magnitude lower mean luminosity and significantly harder spectrum relative to the previous high flux state . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenology is identical to the behavior of the radio millisecond pulsar binary psr j1023 + 0038 in the absence of an accretion disk , where the x - ray emission is produced in an intra - binary shock driven by the pulsar wind . </S>",
    "<S> this further demonstrates that xss j122704859 no longer has an accretion disk and has transformed to a full - fledged eclipsing `` redback '' system that hosts an active rotation - powered millisecond pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for diffuse x - ray emission associated with the binary that may arise due to outflows or a wind nebula . </S>",
    "<S> an extended source situated 1.5@xmath0 from xss j122704859 is unlikely to be associated , and is probably a previously uncatalogued galaxy cluster . </S>"
