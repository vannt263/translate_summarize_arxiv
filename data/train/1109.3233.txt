    "many features of high energy inelastic hadron collisions depend directly on the parton structure of hadrons .",
    "the inelastic scattering of nucleons occurs mainly through a single parton - parton interaction but the contribution from double ( or multiple ) parton collisions can be significant .",
    "information about dp rates is needed for understanding of nature of mpi events and correct estimating background to many rare processes , especially with multi - jet final state .",
    "the cross section of dp events production directly proportional to cross sections of two processes a and b and should be normalized by some scaling parameter @xmath2 in cross section s units . @xmath9 in general sense , @xmath2 is a factor which characterizes a size of the effective interaction region .",

    "we use rates of double interactions ( di ) from two separate @xmath19 collisions and dp from a single @xmath19 collision to extract @xmath2 from their ratio @xcite .",
    "the di events differ from the dp events by the fact that the second parton scattering happens at a separate @xmath19 collision vertex .",
    "data events with a single @xmath19 collision vertex , which compose the sample of dp candidates , are selected separately from events with two vertices which compose a sample of di candidates .",
    "a distinctive feature of the dp events is a presence of two independent parton - parton scatterings within the same @xmath19 collision .",
    "we define the variable sensitive to the kinematics of the dp events : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an azimuthal angle between the @xmath3 vectors of the total transverse momenta of the two two - body systems , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in @xmath0   events .",
