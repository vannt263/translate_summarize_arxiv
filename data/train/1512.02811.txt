    "studies of the dynamics of globally coupled populations of oscillators , pioneered more than 40 years ago by winfree and kuramoto  @xcite , are in the focus of current research due to numerous applications in diverse fields from physics to neuroscience , but also due to striking effects like synchronization , collective chaos , and chimera states  @xcite .    while typically ensembles of identical oscillators either fully synchronize or desynchronize , depending on whether the coupling is attractive or not , there are situations where oscillators produce a macroscopic mean field without full synchrony , such a regime is called partial synchronization  @xcite ( see ref .  @xcite for its experimental observation ) .",
    "remarkably , partial synchronization can be explained within a simplest setup of one - dimensional oscillators , described either by their phase dynamics  @xcite , or as integrate - and - fire units  @xcite .",
    "another way of breaking full synchrony is formation of a chimera state , where part of a population of identical oscillators synchronize and form a cluster , while other remain asynchronous .",
    "this regime requires self - induced bistability , so far such regimes have not been observed in one - dimensional phase models , but in oscillators described by high - dimensional equations  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study mutual coupling of two populations of partially synchronous integrate - and - fire oscillators , and find a surprising chimera state in this system : at mutual 2:1 locking of two macroscopic mean fields , elements of one ensemble form a cluster and a marginally stable scattered group .",
    "this means that nontrivial chimeras can happen in populations of one - dimensional units .",
    "below we will analyze how the mean field dynamics , yielding effective bistability in such ensembles , appears in a self - consistent way .    before proceeding to description of the model",
    ", we mention that mutual influence of two or several populations of oscillators , generating macroscopic mean fields at significantly different frequencies , has been studied recently in the context of phase dynamics of kuramoto model type  @xcite . here",
    "we extend these studies to realistic neural models of integrate - and - fire neurons , which is applicable for explanation of cross - relations between brain waves .",
    "indeed , in brain one observes macroscopic oscillations in different frequency ranges  @xcite , and these realtively regular mean fields are not related to exact synchrony of individual neurons , but rather to a temporal organization of their firing events .",
    "thus , the model of partial synchronization we consider below , appears more adequate for the neural dynamics than the kuramoto model of phase oscillators .",
    "our consideration of two neural populations is based on the model of globally coupled leaky integrate - and - fire oscillations , a prototypical example of generation of nontrivial mean fields due to partial synchronization  @xcite .",
    "one such population has been thoroughly studied in refs .",
    "the potential @xmath0 of each neuron ( here @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the size of the population ) is described by the following equation @xmath3 where the mean field @xmath4 is composed by contributions from all the neurons @xmath5 the potential of neuron @xmath6 grows from @xmath7 to the threshold value @xmath8 , governed by the suprathreshold input current @xmath9 and the excitatory action from the field @xmath4 ( eq .  ) . when this potential reaches @xmath8 at a time instant @xmath10 , the neuron fires , contributing a delta - function pulse to the field @xmath4 ( eq .  ) , and is reset to @xmath7 .",
    "linear equation   describes thus a sequences of so - called @xmath11-pulses created by the spiking neurons . as the analysis of system ( [ eq:1x],[eq:1e ] )",
    "has shown ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) , for large values of the coupling parameter @xmath12 ( at given @xmath11 ) the neurons are desynchronized : the time intervals @xmath13 between successive firing events of two neurons are constant ( do not depend on @xmath6 ) , and the field @xmath4 is nearly a constant ( with small variations @xmath14 ) . at some critical value of coupling @xmath12 this regime becomes unstable , and the neurons start to form a group with a smaller interval between firings , as a result the mean field @xmath15 demonstrate macroscopic nearly periodic variations  @xcite .",
    "this state is called partial synchronization , because neurons never synchronize fully ( never fire simultaneously ) .",
    "in fact , in this state the dynamics is , strictly speaking , quasiperiodic , because frequency of spiking of a neuron @xmath16 ( it this the same for all neurons because they are identical ) is incommensurate to the frequency of the macroscopic mean field oscillations @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we consider two interacting populations of neurons of the described type .",
    "contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite , where two identical populations have been considered , we study two different populations ( while inside each population all the neurons are identical ) , therefore we use slightly changed notations : membrane potentials of the neurons in the populations will be denoted as @xmath0 and @xmath18 , while the mean fields generated by them as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "interaction is due to a mixture of the mean fields : on neurons @xmath21 acts the field @xmath22 , while on neurons @xmath23 acts the field @xmath24 .",
    "parameter @xmath25 describes the coupling between populations .",
    "equivalently , one can consider this setup as one with two acting mean fields @xmath26 , which are fed by spikes from two populations : each spike of a neuron @xmath21 contributes a delta - kick with amplitude @xmath27 to the field @xmath28 , and a delta - kick with amplitude @xmath25 to the field @xmath29 , and similarly for neurons @xmath23 .",
    "we will assume that both populations have equal number of neurons @xmath2 .",
    "the equations of the model thus read @xmath30 integration of these equations can be performed semi - analytically ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) . between the firings , equations for @xmath31",
    "are linear and the solution can be written explicitely , substitution of these solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eq_oscx],[eq_oscy ] ) allows also for an analytic representation of @xmath32 .",
    "this results in transcendent equations for determining the next firing time , which is solved numerically using the newton method .",
    "in this section we focus on the effect of cross - frequency locking in two interacting populations .",
    "as has been already mentioned , one neural population demonstrates macroscopic mean - field oscillations with frequency @xmath17 ; two non - iteracting populations will have generally different macroscopic frequencies @xmath33 .",
    "we demonstrate now , that the interaction can lead to a rather nontrivial regime of locking of these macroscopic oscillations . in fig .",

    "in contradistinction to this , in population @xmath23 all the states are the same ( they take two values because , due to 2:1 locking , the mean field @xmath19 demonstrates two oscillations within one oscillation of the mean field @xmath20 ) what means that neurons in this population are locked by the mean field @xmath55 and fire with the same period as the period of @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 .",

    "this map is the same for all neurons in population @xmath23 .",
    "according to general theory of one - dimensional circle maps , all neurons have the same frequency ( because the rotation number of one - dimensional maps does not depend on initial conditions ) .",
    "moreover , for general one - dimensional maps one has a dichotomy  @xcite : ( i ) either there is an equal number of unstable and stable periodic orbits , the latter attract all the points of the circle except for those lying exactly on unstable orbits ; ( ii ) or the dynamics is quasiperiodic and reduces according to denjoy s theorem to a shift on the circle , here all initially different states remain different .",
    "this dichotomy allows for quasiperiodic ( partial synchronization ) and fully synchronized regimes , but seemingly excludes chimera states .",
    "( a ) for neurons in population @xmath23 in the 2:1 locked regime for @xmath46 . for the chosen phase of the mean field , in the region @xmath67",
    "the map is nearly identity .",
    "this region is resolved in panel ( b ) , where we plot values @xmath68 vs @xmath69 for different choices of @xmath70 .",

    "title=\"fig : \" ]    in the dynamics of our two coupled populations we see , that the population @xmath23 violates the dichotomy above .",
    "to clarify this point , we constructed a stroboscopic map @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is period of the field @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_03_map ] ) and @xmath74 .",
    "one can see that this map is not of general smooth type , as it has an interval ( we call it marginal domain ) where @xmath75 with high accuracy .",
    "this can be seen in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_03_map ] , where the marginal domain is enlarged . here",
    "the deviations @xmath76 are of order @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , these deviations fluctuate in sign , if the stroboscopic map is built at different phases @xmath70 of the mean fields @xmath78 .",
    "these fluctuations are due to the fact , that the fields @xmath55 is , strictly speaking , not exactly periodic . indeed , due to quasiperiodicity of the population @xmath21 , the fields @xmath71 are quasiperiodic , although deviations from the pure periodicity are extremely small and are not seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_21_efields ] .",
    "this quasiperiodicity can , e.g. , be seen if one at a given value of @xmath20 plots values of @xmath79 , these are spread in a small interval .",
    "due to this small spreading , the deviations from identity map fluctuate in the marginal domain .",
    "existence of the marginal domain , together with a complementary interval where @xmath80 , explains the observed chimera state : those neurons which have initial conditions in the non - marginal domain , are attracted to one state and form a cluster , while those in the marginal domain remain scattered and form a `` cloud '' .",
    "noteworthy , the described non - general properties of the dynamics are not pre - built to the system , but appear in a self - consistent manner , because the fields @xmath31 are composed from the contributions from individual neurons .",
    "quite unexpectedly , these mean fields are self - organized in such a manner , that one population is purely quasiperiodic , while another one combines properties of stable and marginal dynamics that results in a chimera .",
    "in this paper we considered two populations of integrate - and - fire oscillators having definitely different frequencies of the generated mean fields .",
    "first we showed , that due to mutual coupling , a 2:1 locking of the mean fields can be observed , without synchronization between the individual neurons .",
    "noteowrthy , neurons in two populations behave differently in the locked state : while in one population they are not synchronized by the mean field and have a different frequency , in another population the period of firings is the same as the basic period of the mean field .",
    "however , this synchronous state is rather nontrivial , and this is our second main result : identical neurons in the synchronous population build a chimera : one part of them forms an identical cluster , while other oscillators do not join this cluster and remain scattered .",
    "we explain this regime as a self - sustained marginal dynamics of the driven neurons : the corresponding stroboscopic one - dimensional map has a domain where this map is practically an identity .",
    "this marginality is possibly the only way to achieve a bistability in a one - dimensional map , as the period here must be independent of initial conditions .",
    "this is another peculiarity of the marginal chimera : in other cases where chimera has been observed in identical units , the frequencies of a cluster and a scattered populations were different  @xcite .",
