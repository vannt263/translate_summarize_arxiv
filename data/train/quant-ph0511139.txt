    "the last decade has seen impressive improvements in the measurements of casimir force @xcite and this has triggered renewed interest in more general direct measurements of vacuum fluctuation effects . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "pointing out the lack of any experimental verification of the vacuum energy gravitational interaction , we noticed that the present macroscopic small force detectors , like the gravitational wave interferometers , might have the sensitivity to measure the extremely small forces exerted by the earth gravitational field on a suitable casimir cavity . as we pointed out ,",
    "the possibility of success is linked both to the realization of a many - cavities layered rigid structure and to an efficient modulation of the casimir energy . as an example , for a @xmath0-cavities structure consisting of alternate layers of aluminum ( 100 nm ) and alumina ( 5 nm ) , with 0.5 modulation depth and tens hz modulation frequency , the signal might be detected in one month integration time with a signal - to - noise ratio of about 100 .",
    "the peculiar properties of such cavities , jointly with modulation depths , make the measurement virtually impossible at this moment of time ; nevertheless , the compatibility of such experimental conditions with a not too optimistic progress in film depositions has `` triggered '' us in searching for methods for the modulation of casimir energy in a rigid cavity without , of course , exchanging with the system an energy too bigger than the modulated casimir energy itself , to avoid destroying any possibility of measurement and control . in this spirit",
    "we have analyzed the possibility to induce variations of energy by realizing the cavity mirrors with materials that can undergo superconducting transitions .",
    "a variation of casimir energy is expected because the mirrors reflectivity changes , while other exchanged energy is expected to be small , being linked to the condensation energy .",
    "the use of a phase transition offers not only the possibility to perform the energy variation , but also an interesting method to measure it .",
    "if the condensation energy and the variation of casimir energy are of comparable magnitude it can be expected that the latter may have a measurable effect on the transition itself .",
    "this is indeed the case if the transition is obtained by means of an external applied magnetic field . for a given temperature , the external field needed to destroy superconductivity , i.e. the critical field",
    ", is in fact proportional to the total variation in free energy between the normal and superconducting state at zero field : if the condensation energy and casimir variation are comparable , the total energy variation , and thus the critical field , of a film being part of a cavity can be sensibly different from that of a simple film .",
    "the aladin2 experiment has been conceived to verify this hypothesis , demonstrating the effect of vacuum fluctuations on a phase transition ; the study of the possibility to modulate casimir energy to verify its gravitational interaction , which was the original starting point , remains as a long term motivation .",
    "the project has been funded by the italian infn ( istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare ) and recently has been joined by the german ipht ( institut f@xmath1r physikalische hochtechnologie ) .",
    "the final measurement is foreseen for the end of 2007 .",
    "although the ideal cavity would be a five - layer structure @xcite , the actual cavity is a three - layer structure that warrants a safer realization and electrical contacting : a thin film of superconducting metal , a dielectric layer and a final film of normal metal .",
    "the cavity is placed at cryogenic temperature and an external magnetic field is applied , parallel to the plane of the films .",
    "the applied field necessary to destroy superconductivity @xmath2 is measured as a function of temperature .",
    "the expected signal is a different behaviour of the function @xmath2 with respect to the critical field @xmath3 of simple film .",
    "details on calculations and on other theoretical aspects can be found in a proceedings paper of this same conference @xcite . in the present paper , after recalling the expected signal for the actual experimental configurations , we will report on our present sensitivity and next experimental steps .",
    "as shown in detail in @xcite , a good choice for the cavity configuration is a structure having a first superconducting film of 5 nm thickness , a second dielectric layer 10 nm thick and a final metal layer 100 nm thick .",
    "the shift in magnetic field is maximized for low condensation energies , so that superconductors having a low @xmath4 should be preferable .",
    "nevertheless , measurements at very low temperatures could be particularly difficult and time consuming , not easily allowing a high number of measurements and statistical analysis . as a good compromise between amplitude of expected signal and multiple measurements we choose to work in the 1 k region of temperatures , where the cooling down time is relatively short and the measurements can be performed on",
    "typically well known soft superconductors ( like aluminum , zinc , tin or even beryllium if deposited on cooled substrate @xcite ) . to illustrate the expected signal , in fig",
    ". 1 @xmath5 is reported for a single film ( dashed curve ) and for an in - cavity film ( green and black curves ) in the optimal configuration of first and third layers made of beryllium and the intermediate layer of a native oxide .",
    "as is seen in the figure the in - cavity film , for reduced temperature @xmath6 approaching unity ( not valid in a neighbourhood @xcite ) , should exhibit an @xmath7 which deviates from the usual law @xmath8 valid for single film .",
    "the ratio of the field shift and simple film field @xmath9 is five - tens percent for reduced temperature sufficiently far from @xmath4 , so that the signal should be quite easily measurable .",
    "unfortunately , although beryllium is a very promising material , its toxicity makes it difficult to find it in the market ( at least properly deposited ) and also to be home deposited .",
    "for this reason we have decided to start the experimental work with more handily materials like aluminum and zinc . in particular ,",
    "aluminum has been chosen since it is a very well known material and can be used to test the sensitivity of the experimental apparatus , while zinc is expected to have a sufficiently low condensation energy to exhibit a measurable signal .",
    "calculations show that the nature of the intermediate oxide layer does not affect sensibly the field shift , while metallic properties of the third layer , in particular plasma frequency and mean free path , heavily do @xcite .",
    "+ the situation is described in fig .",
    "2 , where the ratio @xmath10 is reported for various configurations : first layer of aluminum and third layer of gold ( red curve ) , zinc and gold ( black curve ) , zinc and `` perfect reflector mirror '' ( blue curve ) .",
    "the work of our group is also devoted , at present , to discovering which materials have a sufficiently high plasma frequency and mean free path to approach the behaviour of a perfect mirror . among the metals beryllium",
    "is the best but , again in light of its toxicity , further analysis is devoted to finding whether some alloy or compound might be used instead . from fig .",
    "2 it can be seen that , in case of zinc with not optimal mirror reflectivity ( gold ) , the sensitivity @xmath11 in the measurement of critical field must be of order @xmath12 in the temperature range of interest , and the sensitivity on measurement of the reduced temperature @xmath13 of order @xmath14 , corresponding to the sensitivity in absolute temperature @xmath15 mk . it is important to point out that , in this experiment , alignment requirements are quite stringent : from the formula @xcite @xmath16 , were @xmath17 is the angle between field and sample plane , the penetration depth @xmath18 is typically of order 50 - 100 nm . on considering a film thickness of 5",
    "nm we obtain , near transition , @xmath19 which imposes the stringent limit @xmath20rad ( zinc / gold ) , relaxed to @xmath21 rad for zinc and perfect mirror .",
    "the cryogenic apparatus consists of the commercial cryostat oxford instruments helvltd helioxvl 3he inserted in a hd120h transport dewar , reaching the base temperature of 300 mk .",
    "the external field is generated by a 1.1 gauss / mampere superconducting coil and the current is supplied and measured with a sensitivity better than 1/1000 by a multimeter hp 34401a .",
    "the sample can be oriented parallel ( and orthogonal ) to the magnetic field , aligned by construction with an estimated accuracy of about @xmath22 rad .",
    "possible alignment improvements will be discussed in the next section .",
    "+ the measurement method is a standard omodine four - wire resistance . to test the sensitivity of cryogenic apparatus",
    "a film of 300 nm thickness has been used , so as to have far less stringent limitations on misalignments .",
    "the lock - in frequency is 6 hz and probe current of @xmath23 .",
    "the resistance of the film before transition is @xmath24 .",
    "the actual measurement is performed by fixing the external field and storing @xmath25 .",
    "a set of measurements is reported in fig .",
    "3 : the transition width is approximately 10 mk , the measured residual resistance is about 1 @xmath26 .",
    "the sensitivity of the measurement @xmath27 is limited by the noise current at first stage of the read - out electronic .",
    "the present limit is thought to be sufficient also for the final measurement , where thinner films will have about two orders of magnitude higher resistances . +    the experimental data , reported in fig .",
    "4 in the temperature region of interest , show the expected behaviour @xmath28 . in order to estimate sensitivity in @xmath29",
    "the data have been fitted by taking into account that the correction resulting from nucleation is not negligible , by virtue of sample thickness .",
    "thus , the data have been fitted with @xmath30,\\ ] ] which is valid near @xmath4 , where the conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are satisfied . in the equation @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the thermodynamical field , the effective penetration depth and the coherence length at zero temperature , respectively @xcite .",
    "+    the results of the fit are shown in fig .",
    "4 , where the experimental residuals are reported . in the same figure",
    "the red curves are the confidence bands , the green curve is the expected signal for an aluminum / gold cavity , the purple for a zinc / gold cavity and finally the blue is the zinc expected signal if the contribution of the zero - frequency transverse electric mode is set to zero in the normal state .",
    "+ the residuals show a sensitivity @xmath36 in the region of interest , so that @xmath37 can be estimated as @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath39 mk .",
    "last , from the fit we obtain the values @xmath40 k , @xmath41 k ; @xmath42 nm , @xmath43 nm ; @xmath44 nm , @xmath45 nm k which are in the range of values compatible with the literature . +    from this measurement we find that the sensitivity of the measurement might not be sufficient to detect the aluminum / gold cavity signal ; on the contrary , it should be sufficient to detect it in zinc / gold cavities , allowing also to discriminate the questioned contribution of zero frequency te mode to casimir energy @xcite @xcite .",
    "although these preliminary results on cryogenic apparatus are encouraging , various improvements should be performed before we can state that the needed sensitivity has been reached . in particular ,",
    "two very important effects might spoil the present sensitivity : the broadening of transition width and rising of alignment effects when passing to thinner films . in this spirit , while first experimental studies on zinc deposition and cavity realization are carried out , a first experimental test with aluminum cavities will be performed in a short time ( fall of 2005 ) .",
    "the thickness of aluminum layer will be 10 nm , while the third layer will be gold ( 100 nm ) for some cavities and silver ( 100 nm ) for others .",
    "gold is chosen for its extreme simplicity in deposition , while silver , more reflective , will be tested as a candidate for final configuration material .",
    "+ as discussed previously , the requirements on alignment are quite stringent .",
    "a solution that we will test in the next run is the use , on the same sample , of two simple films , two cavities and a bridge configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "it is important to stress that our experiment looks for a different behaviour of @xmath5 for films being or not being part of a cavity .",
    "thus , this configuration is not aimed at improving accuracy on the measurement but rather at obtaining `` on line '' the different behaviour of the two cases which will have the same misalignment by construction . in this respect ,",
    "we point out that we do not expect that the bridge will be compensated during the transition ; it should instead exhibit a pick by virtue of imperfect equalities of the four samples : the evolution of the pick for different external applied field will be the desired evidence of the different behaviour of the film / cavity @xmath25 . +",
    "these structures are presently under construction at the ipht ( jena ) and the first measurements are foreseen by the end of the year 2005 .",
