    "the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) has played an important role in establishing the extragalactic distance scale ( e.g. , pierce & tully 1988 ; sakai et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this context , it has been treated as a simple and convenient empirical relation between luminosity and line - width .",
    "the reason why it works is also important , particularly to our understanding of galaxies as physical objects and how they formed ( e.g. , eisentstein & loeb 1996 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998a ; courteau & rix 1999 ; van den bosch 2000 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000a , b ) .",
    "now that the issue of the distance scale is widely considered to be settled , we can hope to place an absolute scale on galaxy mass as well as luminosity .    the physical basis of the tully - fisher relation is widely presumed to be a relation between a galaxy s total mass and rotation velocity ( e.g. , freeman 1999 ) .",
    "luminosity is a proxy , being proportional to stellar mass , which in turn depends on the total mass .",
    "mcgaugh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that a more fundamental relationship between the baryonic mass and rotation velocity does indeed exist , provided that both stellar and gas mass are considered ( milgrom & braun 1998 ) .",
    "the relation resulting from the sum of stellar and gas mass is referred to as the baryonic tully - fisher ( btf ) relation .",
    "the btf has also been investigated by bell & de jong ( 2001 ) , verheijen ( 2001 ) , gurovich et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and pfenniger & revaz ( 2005 ) .",
    "these efforts find broadly similar results , in that there is such a relation .",
    "however , details of the relation differ .",
    "mcgaugh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found a steep slope ( @xmath8 ) from a sample dominated by galaxies with @xmath9 or @xmath10-band photometry and rotation velocities estimated from the line - width @xmath11 .",
    "verheijen ( 2001 ) found much the same from @xmath12-band photometry and flat rotation velocities measured from resolved 21 cm cubes .",
    "both these authors assumed a constant value of the stellar mass - to - light ratio for all galaxies . using verheijen s data and a grid of stellar population models to refine the estimate of stellar mass ,",
    "bell & de jong ( 2001 ) found a somewhat shallower slope ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "gurovich et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find a break in the relation , with low mass galaxies following a steeper slope .",
    "there is an equal variety in the physical interpretations .",
    "mcgaugh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argue that the regularity of the btf implies that , after the observed stars and gas are accounted for , no further comparably massive reservoirs of baryons are likely to exist in disk galaxies .",
    "pfenniger & revaz ( 2005 ) use the same data to argue the opposite case : the scatter is somewhat reduced if there are dark baryons weighing several times the observed gas mass . in the context of @xmath14cdm , one would expect still more dark baryons in order to match the universal baryon fraction ( e.g. , mo & mao 2004 ) , though these need not be associated with the disk .",
    "the situation at present remains confused .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the best empirical btf relation possible with the currently available data .",
    "much depends on the value of the stellar mass .",
    "i consider the effects on the btf of varying the stellar mass over a broad range .",
    "mass - to - light ratios are scaled by several recipes : as a fraction of maximum disk ; with respect to stellar population synthesis models ; and by the mass discrepancy  acceleration ( mdacc ) relation ( mcgaugh 2004 ) .",
    "this treats mond ( milgrom 1983 ) as a purely phenomenological prescription .",
    "a grid of btf fits are given that covers essentially any plausible choice of stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the scatter of the relation varies with this choice , and an optimal choice that minimizes the scatter in the btf relation is clear .",

    "mcgaugh et al .  ( 2000 ) have already described the btf over a large range of velocity and mass .",

    "in contrast , ugc 6818 only barely missed the cut imposed in mcgaugh ( 2004 ) , and has more robust global measurements .",

    "the gas mass is that measured in neutral hydrogen , corrected for helium and metals .",
    "other gas phases are presumed to be negligible . in effect , the molecular gas mass is subsumed into the stellar mass ( see discussion in mcgaugh 2004 ) . by the same token , any net internal extinction",

    "a specific , well - defined method for determining @xmath1  recovers the break without input about its existence .",

    "2 illustrates the btf relations stemming from various choices .",
    "a few details concerning each method are worth noting here .",
    "maximum disk is the highest mass - to - light ratio consistent with but not exceeding the rotation curve data .",
    "the inner shape of rotation curves are often quite consistent with the shape predicted by the observed baryons ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ; selwood 1999 ; palunas & williams 2000 ) , leading some to argue that disks must be nearly maximal .",
    "i consider the range @xmath40 .",
    "i adopt the maximum disk value given by the original source for the data for each galaxy ( see sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) .",
    "caution should be exercised in interpreting @xmath33 .",
    "some authors leave room for a dark halo , so that even `` maximum '' disk may provide only @xmath41 of the observed velocity at the peak of the disk contribution ( sackett 1997 ) .",
    "others leave zero room , fitting disk - only models as far out as possible ( e.g. , palunas & williams 2000 ) .",
    "this is a fairly subtle distinction in rotation curve decompositions , but does make a noticeable difference in @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the average @xmath10-band mass - to - light ratio of the palunas & williams ( 2000 ) sample is @xmath42 . since @xmath43 ,",
    "if we scaled this down from a 100% to 84% contribution , the mean would be @xmath44 ( see also barnes , sellwood , & kosowsky 2004 ) .",
    "in general , there is no uniform definition of maximum disk .",
    "the data originate from a wide variety of sources , so there is no guarantee as to how maximal maximum disk is .",
    "moreover , things can go both ways . for low surface brightness disks , very small differences in the rotation curve can lead to large changes in the inferred value of @xmath33  ( swaters et al .",
    "2000 ; mcgaugh , rubin , & de blok 2001 ) . for these galaxies and some of the more extreme dwarf galaxies ,",
    "i have re - assessed the value of maximum disk . in spite of these caveats",
    ", the original value appears sensible for most of the galaxies in table 1 .",
    "there are a few exceptions .",
    "for the ursa major data ( verheijen & sancisi 2001 ) , which comprises a substantial plurality of the data in table 1 , a `` soft '' limit was imposed on the value of @xmath33  so that @xmath15  of the fitted pseudo - isothermal halo did not diverge to absurdly large values ( verheijen 1997 ) .",
    "this can easily happen for galaxies that are well described by maximum disk and for which the data are not very extended in radius .",
    "there is little clear need for a halo in such cases ( palunas & williams 2000 ) , so @xmath15  is poorly constrained and tends towards large values since only the rising portion of the contribution of the dark matter is seen . unfortunately , imposing this `` soft '' constraint can sometimes lead to @xmath33  which is very sub - maximal .",
    "this is a subtle point which only became apparent because @xmath45 for four of the galaxies in table 1 ( sanders & verheijen 1998 ) .",
    "this is a mathematical impossibility , so i have set @xmath46 in these cases .",
    "stellar population models have advanced to the point where they give plausible estimates of the mass - to - light ratio , even for the composite stellar populations of spiral galaxies .",
    "they are not yet perfect of course , but do provide a decent choice for estimating @xmath1  ( bell & de jong 2001 ; portinari et al",
    ".  2004 ) . here",
    "i employ the models of bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to estimate the stellar mass - to - light ratio from the observed color : @xmath47 ( from their table 7 ) .",
    "the @xmath20 color is given precedence in estimating @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath20 is not available , whatever color is available is used .",
    "the most common substitute is @xmath21 , which is expected to be nearly as well correlated with @xmath1  as @xmath20 ( bell & de jong 2001 ) . the same model ( from table 7 of bell et al .",
    "2003 ) is used to estimate @xmath20 ( the bracketed colors in table 1 ) , but @xmath34  is based on the observed color .",
    "credible color information could not be located for ugc 2259 and ddo 170 , the only pieces missing from table 1 .",
    "mcgaugh ( 2004 ) used the detailed shapes of the rotation curves of the galaxies in table 1 to show that there is an empirical relation between acceleration and the amplitude of the mass discrepancy ( essentially the ratio of dark to baryonic mass ) .",
    "this relation holds at every point along a resolved rotation curve for any non - zero choice of mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the scatter about this relation depends on this choice ; @xmath35  is determined by minimizing the scatter with respect to the mean _ local _ relation .",
    "it is interesting to see here how this @xmath1  estimator fares with the _ global _ btf .",
    "the mdacc  is a purely empirical relation .",

    "it is extremely difficult to obtain a sample extending to very low mass which is complete in any meaningful sense .",
    "since an hi  map is a prerequisite for membership in this sample , it seems likely that there are some low mass , high @xmath68  galaxies which are not represented here .",
    "so while there are some clear correlations with disk mass _ in this sample _ , there is no guarantee that precisely these correlations will hold for all galaxies .",
    "there is more hope that correlations between the evolutionary parameters @xmath68 , @xmath1 , and @xmath20 will hold , if only because they make so much sense .",

    "even taking maximum disk in those cases makes little difference to the slope , and causes the curious situation that the imf in these low mass galaxies must be systematically heavier than that in giant galaxies .",

    "there is considerable debate as to whether high surface brightness disks are maximal ( e.g. , sellwood 1999 ; courteau & rix 1999 ) .",
    "there would seem little doubt that low surface brightness disks are dark matter dominated ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 , 2001 ) , but an argument for maximal disks can be made even in these objects ( fuchs 2003 ) .",
    "it is therefor of considerable interest to investigate how maximal disks are , and how disk maximality varies with disk properties .    for the mdacc  mass - to - light ratios favored here ,",
    "the fraction of maximum disk in each case is @xmath103 this is plotted against disk mass and surface density in fig .",
    "there is only a weak correlation of @xmath104  with disk mass ( @xmath105 ) which depends heavily on rather few points at low mass ( cf .",
    "persic & salucci 1988 ) .",
    "dynamical arguments stemming from the adherence of low surface brightness galaxies to the tully - fisher relation ( zwaan et al .  1995 ; sprayberry et al .  1995 ; hoffman et al .",
    "1996 ) suggest that disk maximality @xmath104  should correlate with surface brightness ( tully & verheijen 1997 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998a ; zavala et al .  2003 ) .",
    "we can improve on this by using the mass - to - light ratios @xmath35",
    "to convert the observed central surface brightness into the central surface mass density of stars : @xmath106    as anticipated , there is a good correlation between @xmath104  and @xmath107   ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "a fit to the data in fig .",
    "7 gives @xmath109 in terms of the more directly observable central surface brightness , this translates to @xmath110 .",
    "there is considerably greater scatter about this latter relation .",
    "irrespective of how we frame the relation , or what mass - to - light ratio prescription we prefer , it seems inevitable that the disk contribution must decline systematically as surface density declines .",
    "low surface brightness disks are inevitably dark matter dominated .",
    "in contrast , high surface density disks contribute a non - negligible fraction of the total mass at small radii for plausible @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , this leaves no residual signature in the tully - fisher relation ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998a ; courteau & rix 1999 ) in spite of the generally modest radius at which rotation curves achieve @xmath15 .",
    "statistics of these data , divided into quartiles by @xmath107 , are given in table 6 .",
    "the typical @xmath111 in the highest surface density quartile .",
    "@xmath104  can not exceed unity , and is projected to saturate at @xmath112 .",
    "this is comparable to the highest surface brightness disks that exist ( marshall 2004 ) . in the lowest surface density quartile ,",
    "the typical fraction of maximum disk drops to @xmath113 .",
    "this confirms and quantifies the well - known result that low surface brightness disks are sub - maximal ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "there is no empirical indication that we have reached a lower limit in @xmath104 .",
    "disks lower in surface brightness than the most extreme considered here do exist , though they have yet to be observed with sufficient accuracy to be included here .",
    "ccccc 1 & 15 & 23.31 & 21 & 0.25 + 2 & 15 & 22.31 & 99 & 0.48 + 3 & 15 & 21.52 & 295 & 0.74 + 4 & 15 & 20.41 & 964 & 0.78 +    the meaning of @xmath104  for high surface brightness galaxies is subject to the caveats discussed in  3.1 .",
    "in particular , the effective definition of maximum disk typically accounts for 84% rather than 100% of the velocity at the peak of the disk contribution ( sackett 1997 ) .",
    "if the disks in the highest quartile have 78% of this mass , then they contribute 74% of the velocity at 2.2 scale lengths ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this is not very different from the sub - maximal contribution of 63% advocated by bottema ( 1993 ) and is certainly within the galaxy - to - galaxy scatter .",
    "kregel , van der kruit & freeman ( 2005 ) find a slightly lower mean velocity contribution , but their sample is dominated by intermediate surface brightness galaxies , so such a result is consistent with the trend apparent in fig .  7 .",
    "the results in the literature seem broadly consistent , bearing in mind that a good deal depends on what is really meant by `` maximum disk . ''",
    "the most important point here is that the degree of maximality of a disk depends systematically upon its surface density .",
    "there is no magic value of @xmath104that is a fixed fraction for all disks ( bottema 1997 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1996 ) .",
    "i have explored the baryonic tully - fisher relation for many choices of stellar mass - to - light ratios using a sample of high quality data spanning a large dynamic range in mass .",
    "i provide fits to the btf for each @xmath1 .",
    "there is a particular choice , based on the minimization of the scatter in the local mass - discrepancy  acceleration relation ( the mdacc : mcgaugh 2004 ) , that also minimizes the scatter in the btf .",
    "this optimal btf is @xmath60 with @xmath15  in @xmath16  and the total baryonic mass of a galaxy in @xmath61 .",
    "this provides a remarkably precise method of estimating the mass of rotating galaxies by observation of a single global observable , the level at which the rotation curve becomes flat .",
    "the form in which the baryonic mass resides , stars or gas , makes no difference to the btf . only the sum matters .",
    "this strongly suggests that the btf is a fundamental relation between rotation velocity and baryonic mass .",
    "it further implies that there is no other large reservoir of baryons which matter to the sum : the stars and gas observed in spiral galaxies account for essentially all of the baryonic mass therein .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios determined for the optimal btf are in exceptionally good agreement with stellar population synthesis models .",
    "this consistency , together with the agreement between local and global empirical relations connecting baryonic mass to the observed dynamics , implies that the baryonic mass is well determined .",
    "this would appear to solve the long standing problem of the uncertainty in the mass of stellar disks .    using these robust stellar mass estimates ,",
    "i have examined a variety of evolutionary measures .",
    "the stellar fraction , mass - to - light ratio , and color all correlate with each other as one would expect .",
    "little evolved galaxies with low @xmath68  tend to have blue colors and low @xmath1 ; more evolved galaxies have higher stellar fractions , redder colors , and higher mass - to - light ratios .",
    "these quantities are also correlated with disk mass and rotation velocity : more massive disks tend to be more evolved .    the degree to which disks are maximal varies systematically with stellar surface density .",
    "high surface brightness galaxies tend to be more nearly maximal , typically with @xmath114 of the maximum disk value at @xmath115 .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies are sub - maximal , with @xmath116 of maximum disk at @xmath117 .",
    "there is considerable variation from galaxy to galaxy . in no case",
    "is the stellar mass completely negligible at small radii , a fact that is important to mass models and constraints on the inner slope of the halo mass distribution ( core or cusp ) .",
