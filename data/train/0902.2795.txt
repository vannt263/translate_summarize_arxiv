    "in this paper we consider several connectivity and network design problems . given an undirected graph @xmath7 and two nodes @xmath15 we let @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the edge and vertex connectivities between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath7 .",
    "it is well - known that edge - connectivity problems are `` easier '' than their vertex - connectivity counterparts .",
    "vertex - connectivity exhibits less structure than edge - connectivity and this often translates into significant differences in the algorithmic and computational difficulty of the corresponding problems . as an example , consider the well - known survivable network design problem ( sndp ) : the input consists of an undirected edge - weighted graph @xmath7 and connectivity requirements @xmath18 between each pair of vertices .",

    "in other respects , element - connectivity is related to vertex connectivity .",
    "one class of problems motivating this paper is on generalizing the classical theorem of menger on @xmath28-@xmath29 vertex - connectivity ; we discuss this below .    in studying element - connectivity",
    ", we often assume without loss of generality that there are no edges between terminals ( by subdividing each such edge ) and hence @xmath30 is the maximum number of non - terminal disjoint @xmath4-@xmath5 paths .",
    "menger s theorem shows that the maximum number of internally vertex - disjoint @xmath28-@xmath29 paths is equal to @xmath31 .",
    "hind and oellermann @xcite considered a natural generalization to multiple terminals . given a terminal set @xmath32 , what is the maximum number of trees that each contain @xmath33 and are disjoint in @xmath24 ?",
    "the natural upper bound here is the element connectivity of @xmath33 in @xmath7 , in other words , @xmath34 . in @xcite",
    "a graph reduction step was introduced to answer this question .",
    "cheriyan and salavatiour @xcite called this the problem of packing element - disjoint steiner trees ; crucially using the graph reduction step , they showed that there always exist @xmath35 element - disjoint steiner trees and moreover , this bound is tight ( up to constant factors ) in the worst case .",
    "in contrast , if we seek edge - disjoint steiner trees then lau @xcite has shown that if @xmath33 is @xmath36 edge - connected in @xmath7 , there are @xmath10 edge - disjoint trees each of which spans @xmath33 .    finally , we remark that in some recent work chuzhoy and khanna @xcite gave an @xmath37 approximation for the special case of vc - sndp in which a terminal set @xmath33 needs to be @xmath10-vertex - connected ( this is equivalent to the single - sink problem ) .",
    "their algorithm and analysis are based on a structural characterization of feasible solutions  they use element - connectivity ( they call it weak connectivity ) as a key stepping stone .",
    "subsequent to this paper , chuzhoy and khanna @xcite gave a simple and elegant reduction from the the _ general _ vc - sndp problem to elc - sndp , obtaining an @xmath38-approximation and reinforcing the connection between element- and vertex - connectivity .",
    "the discussion above suggests that it is fruitful to study element - connectivity as a way to generalize edge - connectivity and attack problems on vertex - connectivity . in this paper",
    "we consider the graph reduction step for element - connectivity introduced by hind and oellermann @xcite ( and rediscovered by cheriyan and salavatipour @xcite ) .",
    "we generalize the applicability of the step and demonstrate applications to several problems .    *",
    "a graph reduction step preserving element connectivity : * the well - known _ splitting - off _ operation introduced by lovsz @xcite is a standard tool in the study of ( primarily ) edge - connectivity problems .",
    "given an undirected multi - graph @xmath7 and two edges @xmath39 and @xmath40 incident to @xmath28 , the splitting - off operation replaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 by the single edge @xmath41 .",

    "the reduction lemma , applied repeatedly , transforms a graph into another graph in which the non - terminals form a stable set .",
    "moreover , the reduced graph is a minor of the original graph .",

    "we discuss these below .",
    "* packing element - disjoint steiner trees and forests : * there has been much interest in the recent past on algorithms for ( integer ) packing of disjoint steiner trees in both the edge and element - connectivity settings @xcite .",
    "( a _ steiner tree _ is simply a tree containing the entire terminal set @xmath33 . )",
    "see @xcite for applications of steiner tree packing to vlsi design .",
    "an outstanding open problem is kriesell s conjecture which states that if the terminal set @xmath33 is @xmath64-edge - connected then there are @xmath10-edge - disjoint steiner trees each of which spans @xmath33 ; this would generalize a classical theorem of nash - williams and tutte on edge - disjoint spanning trees .",
    "lau made substantial progress @xcite and proved that @xmath36-connectivity suffices for @xmath10 edge - disjoint steiner trees ; he extended his result for packing steiner forests @xcite .",
    "we remark that mader s splitting - off theorem plays an important role in lau s work .",
    "the element - disjoint steiner tree packing problem was first considered by hind and oellermann .",
    "as we mentioned , cheriyan and salavatipour @xcite gave a nearly tight bound for this problem .",
    "their result relies crucially on theorem  [ thm : ho ] followed by a simple randomized coloring algorithm whose analysis extends a similar algorithm for computing the domatic number of a graph @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the random coloring idea was shown to apply more generally in the context of packing bases of an arbitrary monotone submodular function ; in addition , a derandomization was provided in @xcite via the use of min - wise independent permutations .",
    "it is also known that the problem of packing element - disjoint steiner trees is hard to approximate to within an @xmath65 factor @xcite . here , we consider the more general problem of packing steiner forests that was posed by @xcite .",
    "the input consists of a graph @xmath0 and disjoint terminal sets @xmath66 such that @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "what is the maximum number of element disjoint forests such that in each forest @xmath9 is connected for @xmath69 ?",
    "our local connectivity reduction step is primarily motivated by this question . for general graphs",
    "we prove that there exist @xmath70 element disjoint forests , where @xmath71 .",
    "this can also be viewed as an @xmath72 approximation for the problem .",
    "we apply the reduction lemma to obtain a graph in which the non - terminals are a stable set .",
    "we can not however apply the random coloring approach directly  in fact we can show that it does not work .",
    "instead we decompose the graph into highly connected subgraphs and then apply the random coloring approach in each subgraph separately .",
    "we also study the packing problem in planar graphs and graphs of fixed genus , and prove substantially stronger results . here too , the first step is to use the reduction lemma ( recall that the reduced graph is a minor of the original graph and hence is also planar ) . after the reduction step , we employ a very different approach from the one for general graphs .",
    "our main insight is that planarity restricts the ability of non - terminals to provide high element - connectivity to the terminals .",
    "we formalize this intuition by showing that there are some two terminals @xmath15 that have @xmath13 parallel edges between them which allows us to contract them and recurse . using these ideas , for planar graphs",
    "we prove that there exist @xmath73 disjoint forests .",
    "our method also extends to give an @xmath13 bound for graphs of a fixed genus , and we conjecture that one can find @xmath13 disjoint forests in graphs excluding a fixed minor ; we give evidence for this by proving it for packing steiner trees in graphs of fixed treewidth .",
    "note that these bounds also imply corresponding approximation algorithms for maximizing the number of disjoint forests .",
    "these are the first non - trivial bounds for packing element - disjoint steiner forests in general graphs or planar graphs .",
    "since element - connectivity generalizes edge - connectivity , our bounds in planar graphs are considerably stronger than those of given by lau @xcite for _ edge_-connectivity .",
    "our proof is simple , however , we remark that the simplicity of the proof comes from thinking about element - connectivity ( using the reduction lemma ) instead of edge - connectivity ! our proof also gives the strong property that the non - terminals in the forests all have degree @xmath22 .",
    "* single - sink @xmath10-vertex - connectivity : * polynomial factor inapproximability results for vc - sndp @xcite have focused attention on restricted , yet useful , special cases of the problem . in recent work chakraborty ,",
    "chuzhoy and khanna @xcite considered the single - sink @xmath10-vertex - connectivity problem for small @xmath10 ; the goal is to @xmath10-vertex - connect a set of terminals @xmath33 to a given root @xmath74 .",
    "this problem is approximation - equivalent to the subset @xmath10-connectivity problem in which @xmath33 needs to be @xmath10-connected @xcite . if @xmath75 , this is the np - hard steiner tree problem and a @xmath22-approximation is well - known . for @xmath76 ,",
    "a @xmath22-approximation follows from @xcite whose algorithm can handle the more general vc - sndp with requirements in @xmath77 . for @xmath78 the first non - trivial approximation algorithm",
    "was given in @xcite ; the approximation ratio was @xmath79 .",
    "improvements were given in @xcite with chuzhoy and khanna @xcite achieving the currently best known approximation ratio of @xmath37 .",
    "the algorithms are essentially the same in @xcite and build upon the insights from @xcite ; the analysis in @xcite relied on a beautiful decomposition result for @xmath10-connectivity which is independently interesting from a graph theoretic view point .",
    "the proof of this theorem in @xcite is long and complicated although it is based on only elementary operations . using the reduction lemma , we give an alternate proof of the main technical result which is only half a page long !",
    "we mention that the decomposition theorem has applications to more general network design problems such as the rent - or - buy and buy - at - bulk network design problems as shown in @xcite . due to space constraints",
    "we omit these applications in this paper",
    ".    * related work : * we have already mentioned most of the closely related papers .",
    "our work on packing steiner forests in planar graphs was inspired by a question by joseph cheriyan @xcite .",
    "independent of our work , aazami , cheriyan and jampani @xcite proved that if a terminal set @xmath33 is @xmath10-element - connected in a planar graph then there exist @xmath80 element - disjoint steiner trees , and moreover this is tight .",
    "they also prove that it is np - hard to obtain a @xmath81 approximation for this problem .",
    "our bound for packing steiner trees in planar graphs is slightly weaker than theirs ; however , our algorithms and proofs are simple and intuitive , and generalize to packing steiner forests .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that uses edmonds matroid partition theorem .",
    "one could attempt to pack steiner forests using their approach ( with the stronger reduction lemma in place of theorem  [ thm : ho ] ) , but the theorem of @xcite does not have a natural generalization for steiner forests .",
    "the techniques of both @xcite and this paper extend to graphs of small genus or treewidth ; we discuss this further in section  [ subsec : planarpacking ] .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more discussion of recent work on single - sink vertex connectivity , including hardness results @xcite and extensions to related problems such as the node - weighted case @xcite and buy - at - bulk network design @xcite .",
    "nutov @xcite has recently given alternate algorithms , based on the primal - dual method , for the single - sink vertex - connectivity network design with approximation ratios comparable to those from @xcite .",
    "these algorithms do not have have the advantage of the structural decomposition of @xcite .",
    "we mention that if @xmath82 , that is , we wish to find a min - cost subgraph of @xmath7 that is @xmath10-connected then an @xmath83 approximation is known @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to a survey on network design by kortsarz and nutov @xcite .",
    "let @xmath84 be a graph , with a given set @xmath85 of terminals .",
    "for ease of notation , we subsequently refer to terminals as _ black _ vertices , and non - terminals ( also called steiner vertices ) as _ white_. the elements of @xmath7 are white vertices and edges ; two paths are _ element - disjoint _ if they have no white vertices or edges in common . recall that the element - connectivity of two black vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , denoted by @xmath2 , is the maximum number of element - disjoint ( that is , disjoint in edges and white vertices ) paths between @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath7 .",
    "we omit the subscript @xmath7 when it is clear from the context .    for this section , to simplify the proof",
    ", we will assume that @xmath7 has no edges between black vertices ; any such edge can be subdivided , with a white vertex inserted between the two black vertices .",
    "it is easy to see that two paths are element - disjoint in the original graph iff they are element - disjoint in the modified graph .",
    "thus , we can say that paths are element disjoint if they share no white vertices , or that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath10-element - connected if the smallest set of white vertices whose deletion separates @xmath4 from @xmath5 has size @xmath10 .",
    "recall that our lemma generalizes theorem  [ thm : ho ] on preserving global connectivity .",
    "we remark that our proof is based on a cutset argument unlike the path - based proofs in @xcite for the global case .    given @xmath84 and @xmath33 ,",

    "the pairs have to be distinct since it can not be the case that @xmath98 for any pair @xmath15 .",
    "( to see this , if one of the @xmath2 @xmath4-@xmath5 paths uses @xmath90 , contracting the edge will not affect that path , and will leave the other paths untouched .",
    "otherwise , no path uses @xmath90 , and so it can be deleted . ) .",
    "note that one of @xmath94 could be the same vertex as one of @xmath95 ; for simplicity we will assume that @xmath99 , but this does not change our proof in any detail .",
    "we show that our assumption on the existence of @xmath94 and @xmath95 with the above properties leads to a contradiction .",
    "let @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we use the following facts several times .    1",
    ".   any cutset of size less than @xmath102 that separates @xmath28 and @xmath29 in @xmath103 can not include @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",

    "@xmath104 since @xmath105 .",
    "we define a vertex tri - partition of a graph @xmath7 as follows : @xmath106 is a vertex tri - partition of @xmath7 if @xmath107 and @xmath108 partition @xmath109 , @xmath110 contains only white vertices , and there are no edges between @xmath111 and @xmath108 .",
    "( that is , removing the white vertices in @xmath110 disconnects @xmath111 and @xmath108 . )",

    "for the same reason , it is also easy to see that @xmath87 and @xmath88 can not be both in @xmath118 ( or both in @xmath33 ) ; otherwise @xmath117 would be a cutset of size @xmath119 in @xmath7 .",

    "second , we can not apply the random coloring algorithm on the bipartite graph @xmath47 directly ; we give an example in appendix  [ app : packing ] to show that this approach does not work .",
    "one reason for this is that , unlike the steiner tree case , it is no longer a problem of packing bases of a submodular function . to overcome this second difficulty we use a decomposition technique followed by the random coloring algorithm to prove that there always exist @xmath70 element - disjoint forests .",

    "we borrow the basic idea from @xcite in the _ edge - connectivity _ setting for eulerian graphs ; this idea was later used by lau @xcite in the much more difficult non - eulerian case .",
