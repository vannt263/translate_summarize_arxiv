    "the fact that a metric is finsler but not riemannian means that the norm function on each tangent space is not associated to a scalar product . in this paper , we consider the teichmller metric and thurston s asymmetric metric . both metrics are finsler , and in the case of thurston s asymmetric metric , the finsler norm not only is non - riemannian but it is even not symmetric .",
