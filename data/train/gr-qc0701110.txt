    "coalescing compact binaries composed of neutron stars and/or black holes are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for ground - based laser interferometers @xcite . observations of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) by the _ swift _ and _ hete-2 _ satellites ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) suggest that their central engine may well be the merger remnant of compact binaries that contain a neutron star , namely the remnants of black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) binaries or binary neutron star ( bns ) systems @xcite .",
    "motivated by these considerations , significant theoretical effort has gone into the modeling of these binaries .",
    "so far , most studies of bhns binaries have been performed within the framework of newtonian gravity in either some or all aspects of the calculation ( see , e.g.   @xcite for quasiequilibrium calculations and @xcite for dynamical simulations ) .",
    "more recently , several groups have initiated studies of bhns binaries in a fully relativistic framework , both for quasiequilibrium models @xcite and dynamical simulations @xcite .    in our own effort , we initially studied bhns quasiequilibrium models under the assumption of extreme mass ratios , where the mass of the black hole is much greater than that of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "this assumption is very appealing computationally and therefore a natural first step in a systematic study of these binaries , but breaks down for the astrophysically more interesting comparable - mass binaries .",
    "for the latter , the neutron star is tidally disrupted outside of the black hole s innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ( see , e.g.   @xcite ) and may form an accretion disk , which is considered crucial for launching of a gamma - ray burst .",
    "the observation of such a process would provide a wealth of astrophysical information @xcite . in a subsequent study of quasiequilibrium bhns models @xcite , we therefore relaxed the assumption of extreme mass ratios and studied comparable - mass binaries ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we construct quasiequilibrium models by solving einstein s constraint equations in the conformal thin - sandwich formalism ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "these equations constrain only some of the gravitational fields ; others , namely the conformal background solution , are freely specifiable and have to be chosen before the equations can be solved ( see section [ sec : iia ] below ) . in our previous studies",
    "@xcite we chose a background solution describing a single black hole in kerr - schild coordinates ( in @xcite we also include results for a spatially flat background for extreme mass ratio binaries ) .",
    "this seemed appealing in a number of ways ; for example , it allows for black hole spin and the coordinate system extends smoothly into the black hole interior .",
    "however , in @xcite we found sizable deviations from post - newtonian ( pn ) results which we could attribute , at least in part , to the choice of the background solution @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent black hole boundary conditions of cook and pfeiffer @xcite ( see also @xcite ) allow for black hole rotation and penetrating coordinates even for a spatially flat background solution , which simplifies the equations significantly .",
    "in this paper we therefore revisit quasiequilibrium models of bhns binaries .",
    "we now use a spatially flat background solution instead of a kerr - schild metric ( compare @xcite ) , and we also adopt a new decomposition of the field variables which significantly reduces the numerical error that was still present in @xcite ( see appendix [ appendix : eq ] ) .",
    "we construct sequences of bhns binaries in quasicircular orbits for fixed black hole irreducible masses and neutron star baryon rest masses , and focus on irrotational neutron stars orbiting approximately nonspinning black holes ( we will implement a more accurate condition for nonspinning black holes in the future , following @xcite ) .",
    "we find excellent agreement with post - newtonian results for large binary separations .",
    "we track cusp formation to locate the onset of tidal disruption , and , for large mass ratios and neutron star compactions , find turning - points on a binding energy curve to locate the isco .",
    "for those sequences that encounter an isco we find reasonable agreement with the isco of test particles around schwarzschild black holes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review the basic equations in section ii .",
    "we present numerical results in section iii , and provide a comparison with the results of @xcite in section iv . in section v we briefly summarize our findings .    throughout this paper",

    "latin and greek indices denote purely spatial and spacetime components , respectively .",
    "in this section we briefly review the equations we solve to obtain a bhns binary in quasiequilibrium . for a more detailed discussion",

    "the spatial metric @xmath12 is further decomposed according to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the conformal factor and @xmath16 the background spatial metric .",
    "we also decompose the extrinsic curvature @xmath17 into a trace @xmath18 and a traceless part @xmath19 according to @xmath20 the hamiltonian constraint then becomes @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the covariant laplace operator , @xmath23 the covariant derivative , @xmath24 the ricci tensor , and @xmath25 the scalar curvature , all associated with the conformal background metric @xmath16 .",
    "we employ the conformal thin - sandwich decomposition of the einstein equations @xcite . in this decomposition ,",
    "we use the evolution equation for the spatial metric to express the traceless part of the extrinsic curvature in terms of the time derivative of the background metric , @xmath26 , and the gradients of the shift vector . under the assumption of equilibrium ,",

    "( [ eq : taij ] ) .",
    "the conformally related spatial metric @xmath16 and the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath18 remain freely specifiable , and have to be chosen before we can solve the above equations ( note that we have already set to zero the time derivatives of these quantities , which are also freely specifiable ) .",
    "in @xcite we identified these quantities with the corresponding quantities for a schwarzschild black hole in kerr - schild coordinates .",

    "having taken into account the expression of the 3-velocity , the equation of continuity becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the covariant derivative associated with @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed derivation of the hydrostatic equations , and to @xcite for bns applications .",

    ", we focus on the case @xmath0 . using this equation of state , the definition of the specific enthalpy @xmath49 , and a thermodynamic relation ( gibbs - duhem relation ) @xmath62",
    "we obtain the internal energy density @xmath63    since dimensions enter the problem only through the constant @xmath61 , it is convenient to rescale all dimensional quantities with respect to the polytropic length scale @xmath64      in order to solve the gravitational field equations ( [ eq : ham_constr ] ) , ( [ eq : mom_constr ] ) , and ( [ eq : trace_evolv ] ) , we have to set appropriate boundary conditions on two different boundaries : outer boundaries at spatial infinity and inner boundaries on the black hole horizons .",
    "the boundary conditions at spatial infinity follow from the assumption of asymptotic flatness . with the help of a radial coordinate transformation @xmath65 in the external computational domain our computational grid extends to spatial infinity @xcite ,",
    "and we can impose the exact boundary conditions @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the orbital angular velocity of the binary system measured at infinity , and @xmath68 is a cartesian coordinate which origin is located at the center of mass of the binary system . here , we express the shift vector @xmath11 in a corotating coordinate system that we adopt throughout our calculation . in an inertial coordinate system",
    ", the shift vector would tend to zero at spatial infinity , while in the corotating coordinate system of the numerical code the shift vector diverges at spatial infinity . for computational purposes",
    "it is therefore convenient to write the shift vector as a sum of the rotational shift term @xmath69 and a residual part ( which tends to zero at spatial infinity ) , and solve the equations only for the latter ( see appendix [ appendix : eq ] for a detailed explanation of the decomposition of the metric quantities and related equations ) .",
    "the inner boundary conditions arise from the excision of the black hole interior .",
    "the assumption that the black hole is in equilibrium leads to a set of boundary conditions for the conformal factor and shift vector @xcite ( see also @xcite as well as the related isolated horizon formalism , e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : beta_perp ] ) and ( [ eq : beta_para ] ) with @xmath82",
    ". this assignment corresponds to a `` leading - order approximation '' in the language of @xcite , and we plan to implement their more accurate condition for nonspinning black holes in the future . according to @xcite , the boundary condition on the lapse function can be chosen freely .",
    "in this paper , we choose a neumann boundary condition @xmath83 on the excised surface , where @xmath84 is a radial isotropic coordinate .      in this paper",
    "we take the rotational axis of the binary system to be the @xmath80-axis , and the line connecting the black hole and neutron star centers to be the @xmath85-axis . to impose a quasicircular orbit",
    "we require a force balance along the @xmath85-axis at the center of the neutron star , which results in the condition @xcite @xmath86 here @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the @xmath85 and @xmath89-coordinates of the center of the neutron star relative to the rotational axis of the binary system . imposing this condition determines the orbital angular velocity @xmath67 .",
    "we confirm that the orbital angular velocity obtained by this method agrees with that obtained by requiring the enthalpy at two points on the neutron star s surface to be equal @xcite within one part in @xmath90 .",
    "it is reasonable to require that the irreducible mass of the black hole and the baryon rest mass of the neutron star are conserved during the inspiral of the bhns binaries .",
    "for such a constant - mass sequence we then monitor the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass , the komar mass , and the total angular momentum , all of which are defined globally as follows .",
    "the irreducible mass of the black hole is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the proper area of the event horizon . in practice",
    "we approximate this area with that of the apparent horizon , @xmath93 , which is computed from an integral on the excision surface @xmath94 , @xmath95 the baryon rest mass of the neutron star is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the determinant of @xmath9 . in our case",
    "we have @xmath98 , so that @xmath99 in the polytropic units of eq .  (",
    "[ eq : poly_units ] ) we normalize the baryon rest mass according to @xmath100 whereby @xmath101 is the rest mass of the polytrope for polytropic constant @xmath102 .",
    "we express the adm mass in isotropic cartesian coordinates as @xmath103 the komar mass can be written as @xmath104 where we use the fact that the shift vector falls off sufficiently rapidly .",
    "the total angular momentum is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a spatial cartesian coordinate relative to the center of mass of the binary system .",
    "finally , the linear momentum is @xmath107 where we have assumed maximal slicing @xmath35 .    during the iteration",
    ", we require that the linear momentum vanishes .",
    "we enforce this by changing the position of the black hole and neutron star relative to the location of the axis of rotation .",
    "stated differently , this condition fixes the location of the axis of rotation .",
    "we define the binding energy of the binary system as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the adm mass of the binary system at infinite orbital separation , as defined by the sum of the irreducible mass of the isolated black hole and the adm mass of an isolated neutron star with the same baryon rest mass , @xmath110    in order to measure a global error in the numerical results , we define the virial error as the fractional difference between the adm mass and komar mass , @xmath111",
    "our numerical code is based on the spectral method lorene library routines developed by the meudon relativity group @xcite .",
    "our computational grid depends on the orbital separation , the mass of the neutron star , and the mass ratio .",
    "for example , the grid is divided into 10 ( 8) domains for the black hole ( neutron star ) at large separations for a neutron star mass of @xmath112 and mass ratio @xmath113 .",
    "each domain for the black hole is covered by @xmath114 collocation points and those for the neutron star by @xmath115 , where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 denote the collocation points in the radial , polar , and azimuthal directions , respectively .",
    "we use a larger number of collocation points for the black hole domains than the neutron star domains because the source terms of the gravitational field equations for the black hole vary slightly around the neutron star position .",
    "the amplitude of this excess in the source terms is small but significantly affects the accuracy of the results . in order to resolve this source in the black hole domains , which are centered on the black hole ,",
    "we need a higher angular resolution .",
    "on the other hand , the source terms of the gravitational field equations for the neutron star have large contributions only near the neutron star , and drop off monotonically away from the neutron star . thus",
    "a smaller angular resolution is sufficient in the neutron star domains , which are centered on the neutron star .",
    "( see appendix [ appendix : eq ] for the decomposition of the gravitational field equations into the black hole and neutron star parts . )    as stated above , we choose @xmath0 for the adiabatic index of the polytropic equation of state in this paper , and compute several different constant - mass inspiral sequences .",
    "we consider neutron stars of rest mass @xmath119 and 0.10 , with corresponding compactions of @xmath120 and 0.0879 . here",
    "@xmath121 is the areal radius of the neutron star in isolation .",

    "we also consider mass ratios @xmath126 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 10 .",
    "note again that we fix the irreducible mass of the black hole and the baryon rest mass of the neutron star for the construction of constant - mass sequences . for the definition of the mass ratio ,",
    "however , we use the adm mass of a spherical isolated neutron star @xmath127 , since this turns out to be more convenient for comparisons with third - order post - newtonian results .",

    "instead , we carefully separate the source terms in such a way that no metric quantities that are excised in the black hole interior affect the right - hand side of the neutron star equation .",
    "specifically , we first decompose the metric quantities as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the rotational shift vector .",
    "we then decompose the gravitational field equations as follows .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ham_constr ] ) becomes @xmath176 eq .",

( [ eq : trace_evolv ] ) is written as @xmath178 where we define @xmath179 as @xmath180    note that the neutron star equations ( [ app : ham_ns ] ) , ( [ app : mom_ns ] ) , and ( [ app : trace_ns ] ) contain metric quantities like @xmath10 and @xmath15 that are not defined inside the excised black hole , but only in products with matter quantities that vanish outside the neutron star . as a consequence , the neutron star equations are regular everywhere .",
    "all singular , or un - defined terms have been moved to the black hole equations , where they are harmless since they are excised from the computational grid .",
    "we finally point out that the outer boundary conditions of the total lapse function and total conformal factor are asymptotically flat , i.e. , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "this implies that each part of the metric quantities , i.e. , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , can not go to unity individually at infinity .",
    "we set the outer boundary conditions for these quantities as @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 for the convenience of the computation .",
