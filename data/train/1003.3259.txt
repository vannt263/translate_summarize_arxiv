    "graphical markov models are probability distributions defined for a @xmath0 random vector variable @xmath1 whose component variables may be discrete , continuous or of both types and whose joint density @xmath2 satisfies the independence statements specified directly by an associated graph as well as those implied by the graph .",
    "the set of all such statements is the independence structure captured by the graph .",
    "one such type of graph was introduced for sequences of regression by cox and wermuth ( @xcite ) for which special results have been derived by drton ( @xcite ) , kang and tian ( @xcite ) , marchetti and lupparelli ( @xcite ) , wermuth and cox ( @xcite ) , wermuth , wiedenbeck and cox ( @xcite ) , wermuth , marchetti and cox ( @xcite ) , wermuth and sadeghi ( @xcite ) .",
    "a regression graph consists of nodes , say in set @xmath3 , that represent random variables , and of edges that couple node pairs such that a recursive order of the joint responses is reflected in the graph .",
    "associated discrete distributions have some desirable properties derived by drton ( @xcite ) .",
    "each defining independence constraint respects the given recursive ordering of the joint responses ; see marchetti and lupparelli ( @xcite ) .",
    "this feature distinguishes regression graphs from all other currently known types of chain graphs and permits one to model data from both interventional and observational studies .",
    "because of this property , regression graphs are particularly well suited to the study of effects of hypothesized causes on sequences of joint responses ; see cox and wermuth ( @xcite ) . more generally , they can model developmental processes , such as in panel studies .",
    "these provide data on a group of individuals , termed the ` panel ' , collected repeatedly , say over years or decades .",
    "often one wants to compare corresponding analyses with results in other studies that have core sets of variables in common , but that have omitted some of the variables or that were carried out for subpopulations .",
    "it is an outstanding feature of regression graph models that their implications can be derived after marginalising over some variables , say in set @xmath4 , or after conditioning on others , say in set  @xmath5 . in particular , graphs can be obtained for node set @xmath6 that capture precisely the independence structure implied by a generating graph in node set @xmath3 for the distribution of @xmath7 given @xmath8 .",
    "such graphs are called independence - preserving , when they can be used to derive the independence structure that would have resulted from the generating graph by conditioning on a larger node set @xmath9 or by marginalising over a larger node set @xmath10 .",
    "two types of such classes are known .",
    "one is the subclass of the much larger class of mc graphs of @xcite , which can be generated by a regression graph in a larger node set .",
    "another class contains the mag s ( maximal ancestral graphs ) of @xcite .",
    "we speak of two corresponding graphs if they result from a given generating graph relative to the same conditioning and marginalising sets .",
    "a third class of this type is the summary graph of @xcite .",
    "this class is presented in the current paper in simplified form together with proofs based on operators for binary matrix representations of the graphs .",
    "in contrast to a mag , a corresponding summary graph can be used to identify those dependences of a given generating process for @xmath1 with @xmath11 that remain undistorted in the corresponding mag model for @xmath7 given @xmath8 and those that may be severely distorted .",
    "this is especially helpful at the planning stage of studies when alternative sets @xmath4 and @xmath5 are considered given a hypothesized generating graph in @xmath11 .",
    "annotated , undirected graphs of @xcite , for @xmath5 empty , serve a similar purpose .",
    "the warning signals for distortions provided by summary graphs are essential for understanding consequences of a given data generating process with respect to dependences in addition to independences . for this",
    ", some special properties of the types of generating graph will be introduced as well as specific requirements on the types of generating process .",
    "these lead to families of distributions that are said to be generated over parent graphs .",
    "some definitions for graphs are almost self - explanatory .",
    "if pair @xmath12 of @xmath3 is coupled by a  directed edge such that an arrow starts at node @xmath13 and points to node @xmath14 , then @xmath13 is named a parent of @xmath14 and @xmath14 the offspring of @xmath13 . for two disjoint subsets @xmath15 and @xmath16 of @xmath3 , an @xmath17-arrow , @xmath18 ,",
    "is said to point from @xmath16 to @xmath15 if the arrow starts at a node @xmath13 in @xmath16 and points to a  node @xmath14 in @xmath15 .",
    "nodes other than the endpoint nodes are the inner nodes of a path ; only the inner nodes have to be distinct . for three or more nodes",
    ", an @xmath17-path connects the path endpoint nodes @xmath14 and @xmath13 by a sequence of edges that couple its inner nodes .",
    "an @xmath17-path with @xmath19 is a cycle .",
    "an edge is regarded as a path without inner nodes .",
    "both a graph and a path are called directed if all its edges are arrows . if all arrows of a directed @xmath17-path point towards node  @xmath14 , then node @xmath13 is named an ancestor of @xmath14 and @xmath14 a descendant of @xmath13 .",
    "such a path is also called a descendant  ancestor path",
    ".    directed acyclic graphs form an important subclass of regression graphs .",
    "they arise from stepwise generating processes of exclusively univariate response variables ; see section  [ sec2 ] below .",
    "these graphs have no directed cycles .",
    "as we shall show , two different types of undirected graph are subclasses of regression graphs , named covariance graphs and concentration graphs . for joint gaussian distributions ,",
    "they give models for zero constraints on covariances or on concentrations , respectively ; see @xcite and and below . to distinguish between them in figures , edges in concentration graphs are shown as full lines , @xmath20 , and in covariance graphs by dashed lines , @xmath21 .",
    "separation criteria provide what is called the global markov property of a graph since it gives all independence statements that belong to the graph s independence structure .",
    "[ d1 ] a graph , consisting of a node set and of one or more edge sets , is an independence graph if node pairs are coupled by at most one edge and each missing edge corresponds to at least one independence statement .",

    "notion of separation applies to both types of undirected graph .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be two non - empty , disjoint subsets of their node set @xmath3 and let @xmath22 partition @xmath3 , then we write @xmath23 is conditionally independent of @xmath24 given @xmath25 compactly as @xmath26 . in a concentration graph , @xmath15 is separated by @xmath27 from @xmath16 if every path from @xmath15 to @xmath16 has a node in @xmath27 , while in the covariance graph , @xmath15 is separated by @xmath28 from @xmath16 if every path from @xmath15 to @xmath16 has a node in @xmath28 .",
    "given separation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 by set @xmath27 , a  concentration graph implies @xmath26 ; see @xcite .",
    "given separation of @xmath15 and  @xmath16 by set @xmath28 , a covariance graph implies @xmath26 ; see @xcite , who expresses the result in a different but equivalent way .",
    "when a graph is directed or contains different types of edge then its separation criterion is more complex than the one for undirected graphs . for directed acyclic graphs",
    ", there are several different separation criteria that permit us to obtain all independence statements implied by the graph ; see @xcite for proofs of equivalence .",
    "the criterion due to @xcite , has been extended in almost unchanged form by koster ( @xcite ) to the much larger class of mc graphs .",
    "a path - based proof , due to @xcite , is for the subclass of mc graphs that is of interest here , the mc graphs that can be derived from a larger directed acyclic graph . for summary graphs ,",
    "see lemma  [ l1 ] below .",
    "a list of independence statements associated with the missing edges of an independence graph gives a graph s pairwise markov property .",
    "whenever it defines the graph s independence structure , then the pairwise markov property is said to be equivalent to the global markov property .    for all disjoint subsets @xmath29 of node set @xmath3 ,",
    "the following general definitions are relevant , respectively , for combining pairwise independences in covariance graph and in concentration graph models .",
    "[ d2 ] the composition property is @xmath30    [ d3 ] the intersection property is @xmath31    given these properties , the independence structure of interest in a covariance or concentration graph model can be specified in terms of independence constraints on a set of variable pairs . for general searching discussions , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions under which discrete and gaussian distributions satisfy the intersection property have been derived by san martin , mochart and rolin ( @xcite ) .",
    "they show in particular that of the commonly specified sufficient conditions , some may be much too strong  for instance , requiring exclusively positive probabilities for discrete distributions . for joint gaussian distributions , a positive definite joint covariance matrix is sufficient . in both cases ,",
    "no component of the involved random variables is degenerate .",
    "[ d4 ] a family of joint distributions is said to vary fully if its random variables contain no degenerate components and it satisfies the intersection property .",
    "[ d5 ] in families of joint distributions with the composition property , pairwise independent variables are also mutually independent .    for families of joint distributions with the composition property ,",
    "in which a regression graph with a complete concentration graph captures the independences of interest , the global and the pairwise markov property are equivalent ; see also @xcite .    for a long time , only the family of gaussian distributions was known to satisfy both the composition and the intersection property provided it varies fully .",
    "under the same type of constraint , this is now known to hold for the special family of distributions in symmetric binary variables introduced by wermuth , marchetti and cox ( @xcite ) .",
    "more important , as we shall see , it holds for families generated over so - called parent graphs .",
    "the notion of completeness has been introduced and studied in quite different contexts [ see @xcite ; @xcite , theorem 2.12 ; and mandelbaum and rschendorf @xcite ] .",
    "it means that the joint family of distribution of vector variable @xmath32 is such that a zero expectation of any function @xmath33 implies that the function itself is zero with probability one , that is , almost surely ( a.s . ) .",
    "[ d6 ] let @xmath34 denote the density of a member of a complete family of distributions and @xmath33 be some function of @xmath32 .",
    "then it holds that @xmath35    for any trivariate family of distributions with precisely two associated variable pairs , say @xmath36 and @xmath37 , but @xmath38 , completeness of the joint distribution is sufficient to conclude that @xmath39 is conditionally dependent on @xmath40 given @xmath41 .",
    "this follows from corollary  3 of @xcite and properties of completeness .",
    "in this situation , the generating graph @xmath42 is inducing a @xmath43-edge in the summary graph obtained by conditioning on node 1 and a  non - vanishing conditional association for @xmath44 given @xmath41 .    in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we define parent graphs as directed acyclic graphs with special properties and corresponding types of stepwise generating processes such that edge - inducing paths are also association - inducing .",
    "the families of distributions generated over parent graphs and the members of the families satisfy the intersection and the composition property in addition to the general laws of probability that govern independences in any joint family of distribution ; for a discussion of the latter see @xcite .",
    "in contrast to mc graphs and mags , regression graphs are not closed under marginalising and conditioning , that is , one can get from a given regression graph outside the class of regression graphs after marginalising and conditioning as illustrated with figure  [ fig3 ] below .",
    "but the graph resulting in this way from any regression graph is always within the class of summary graphs .",
    "this explains partly why we study the larger class of summary graphs.=-1    [ d7 ] a summary graph , @xmath45 , has node set @xmath46 , which consists of disjoint subsets @xmath47 , ordered as @xmath48 . within @xmath49 ,",

    "the notions of parents , offsprings , ancestors and descendants remain unchanged in a  summary graph compared to a directed acyclic graph .",
