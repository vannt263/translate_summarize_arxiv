    "until recently , little was known about the shape of dark halos : measurements of the equatorial rotation curve provide a one dimensional probe to the potential only .",
    "it is possible to construct both spherical and flat mass models which generate the same rotation curve .",
    "therefore , the shape of the dark halo can not be inferred from galactic rotation curves alone .",
    "existing methods to estimate the shape of dm - halos have given mixed results .",
    "it has been suggested ( dekel & shlosman , 1983 ; toomre , 1983 ; sparke & casertano , 1988 ) that galactic warps , frequently observed in the outer parts of gaseous disks , result if the galactic disk is tilted with respect to the plane of a flattened dark halo .",
    "hoffner & sparke ( 1994 ) investigated the time evolution of such warps and concluded that only one out of the five systems they studied requires a halo as flattened as e6 .",
    "polar ring galaxies , early type spirals with material rings in a plane perpendicular to the galaxy plane , probe the dark halo potential in two perpendicular directions . careful analysis of the stellar and gas dynamics of the polar ring system ngc 4650a , led sackett & sparke ( 1990 , hereafter ss90 ) and sackett ( 1994 , srjf94 hereafter ) to conclude that the dark halo in this system could be as flattened as e6-e7 ( @xmath0=0.4 to 0.3 ) .",
    "recently , sackett ( 1994b ) reported the discovery of a rather flattened ( @xmath1 ) _ luminous _ halo around the edge - on spiral ngc 5907 , which can account for the observed rotation curve provided that this luminous material has a large mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath2 450 ) .    like the polar rotation curve , the thickness of the gas layer depends on the vertical force , , and hence on the shape of the dm - halo ( maloney 1992 ; olling & van gorkom 1992 ; kundi 1993 , khg93 ; maloney 1993 , m93 ) . that the shape of the dark halo influences the vertical distribution of the gas can be easily understood .",
    "consider a round halo , with a certain density distribution , then decrease the vertical scale - height while maintaining the total mass .",
    "consequently , the densities as well as the exerted gravitational forces will increase , resulting in a thinner hi disk and higher rotation speeds . in order to keep the same equatorial rotation curve",
    ", one has to deform the dm - halo in a very specific way ( appendix a , figure [ fig : rc.rho0.versus.q ] ) as a result of which the dm - halo densities ( at large distances ) will be roughly inversely proportional to the flattening @xmath3 . in accordance with maloney ( 1993 ) , i find that ( at large distances ) the thickness of the gas layer is roughly proportional to the square root of the halo flattening , @xmath0 .",
    "several authors have employed measurements of the gas layer thickness to infer the total mass density in the plane of spiral galaxies .",
    "van der kruit ( 1981 ) showed that the width of a galaxy s gaseous disk should increase radially in an exponential fashion . from the thickness measurements of the gaseous disk of the edge - on galaxy ngc 891 by sancisi & allen ( 1979 ) van der kruit concluded that the ratio of the stellar disk does not change significantly with radius and that the dark halo can not be as flat as the stellar disk .",
    "rupen ( 1991 ) , using more sensitive and much higher resolution data , found that the width of the gaseous disks of ngc 891 and ngc 4565 increase exponentially , but for ngc 891 with large scatter .",
    "our galaxy has been studied in much greater detail by knapp ( 1987 ) and merrifield ( 1992 ) in hi , and by malhotra ( 1994 ) in co. these authors find that the radial scale - length of the midplane mass density compares well with the radial scale - length of the stellar disk , implying a constancy of the mass - to - light ratio for the stellar disk .",
    "van der kruit ( 1988 ) concludes that in the outer parts of stellar disks the local mass density is no longer dominated by the stellar disk so that the self - gravity of the gas will become important . here",
    "i extend van der kruit s pioneering work by incorporating the stellar and gaseous disks as well as the dm - halo in a self consistent way : rather than making a _",
    "local _ approximation to the vertical force , is calculated from the _ global _ mass distribution of the galaxy . in ",
    "[ sec - gaseous - self - gravity ] i show that the self - gravity of the gas can play an important role and must be included in a self - consistent manner .",
    "furthermore i will concentrate on the flaring behaviour in the region beyond the optical disk where the vertical force is dominated by the dm - halo , and is hence sensitive to its _ shape_. in combination with the newly achievable large sensitivities and the high resolution of hi synthesis observations ( rupen , 1991 ) , these improved modelling methods allow for the determination of the shape of dark halos of spiral galaxies .    in  [ sec - dark - halo - props ] i review some of the properties of dark halos and determine ( in  [ sec - flattened - dark - halos ] ) how , for a given rotation curve , the core radius and central density depend on the flattening of such an isothermal halo ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "the disk - halo conspiracy is investigated in section ",
    "[ sec - disk - halo - conspiracy ] ( and appendix b ) where i derive general formulas for the three unknowns ( the disk s ratio and the halo s core radius and central density ) which determine the overall mass distribution of the galaxy . in  [ sec - the - works ] i list the assumptions made to determine the z - distribution of the gas from the galaxian potential .",
    "i compare the local and global approaches in  [ sec - the - local - approach ] , where i also present the vertical force arising from the total mass distribution of the galaxy , @xmath4 , for several radii ( an analytic solution to the multi - component local approximation , as proposed by bahcall ( 1984 ) , is given in appendix c ) . in ",
    "[ sec - halo - shape - gas - layer - thickness ] i calculate how the thickness of the gas layer depends on the two free parameters ( and @xmath0 ) and discuss how the thickness of the gas layer can be used to determine the flattening of the dm - halo . in the discussion ,  [ sec - discussion ] , i will indicate which systems might be suitable for an analysis as proposed in this paper .",
    "from the observational fact that rotation curves of spiral galaxies are `` flat '' , it has been concluded ( e.g. bosma 1978 ; rubin 1980 ; bahcall & casertano 1985 ; begeman 1987 ) that there is an unseen mass component present in these galaxies .",
    "the standard assumption has been that this dark mass distribution is spherical and isothermal , characterized by the core radius , @xmath5 , and central density , @xmath6 ( equation [ [ eq : rho.halo.rz ] ] , with @xmath7=1 ) .",
    "the luminous matter consists of a stellar disk , for some systems a bulge , and a gaseous disk .",
    "the ratios of the bulge and the disk are free parameters but are normally taken to be constant with radius . an upper limit to the ratio of the disk , and hence a lower limit to the dark halo mass ,",
    "can be obtained by assuming that the observed peak rotation velocity is due to the stellar disk only .",
    "a more common approach is to scale the mass - to - light ratios down in such a way as to avoid halos with hollow cores .",
    "this is commonly known as the `` maximum - disk '' hypothesis ( van albada & sancisi , 1986 ) .",
    "other means of constraining the ratio exist : van der kruit ( 1981 ) calculates from the thickness of the gas layer , efstathiou ( 1982 ) invoke disk stability arguments , athanassoula ( 1987 , abp87 ) apply spiral instability criteria , and bottema ( 1993 ) uses stellar velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios found by these authors range from 50 to 100 % of the maximum - disk value .",
    "the values for the dm - halo core radius and the ratio of the stellar disk are highly correlated : low mass - to - light ratios require small core radii , and large ratios correspond to large values for the dm - halo core radius .",
    "in fact , many different disk - halo decompositions produce acceptable fits to a given observed rotation curve ( van albada _",
    "et al . _ , 1985",
    "hereafter abbs85 ; persic & salucci , 1988 ; lake & feinswog , 1989 hereafter lf89 ) .",
    "the dark to luminous mass ratio may decrease with increasing mass ( e.g. abp87 ; casertano & van gorkom 1992 ; broeils 1992 , chapter 10 ) .",
    "this could be inferred from galactic rotation curves : dwarf galaxies have rising rotation curves ( e.g. carignan & freeman 1988 ) while the rotation curves of massive galaxies fall in the outer parts ( casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; broeils 1992 ) . for",
    "those galaxies where the rotation curves in the outer parts are flat , the luminous and dark matter `` conspire '' : the increase of @xmath8 and the decline in @xmath9 are such that their sum remains approximately constant with galactocentric radius .",
    "in view of the uncertainties in the disk - halo decomposition , it is clear that more and a different kind of data are needed for a unique determination of the halo flattening . in section ",
    "[ sec - halo - shape - gas - layer - thickness ] i show that beyond the optical disk the thickness of the gas layer is rather sensitive to the flattening of the halo . in order to investigate this sensitivity quantitatively",
    "i construct a two parameter galaxy model , where these parameters are @xmath10 (= the fraction of the peak rotation curve due to the stellar disk , see  [ sec - disk - halo - conspiracy ] and appendix b ) and @xmath0 , the flattening of the dm - halo (  [ sec - flattened - dark - halos ] and appendix a ) .",
    "the explicit dependence of the thickness of the gas layer upon these two parameters is discussed in ",
    "[ sec - halo - shape - gas - layer - thickness ] .      as mentioned above , the equatorial rotation curve ( i.e. the rotation curve in the plane of the stellar disk ) does not constrain the actual shape of the halo . in appendix",
    "a i determine a family of flattened dm - halo models which have the same ( to within @xmath11 % ) equatorial but different polar rotation curves .",
    "thus , for this family of halo models , the radial force does not depend significantly on the shape of the dm - halo , while the vertical force ( and hence the thickness of the gas layer ) does . in figure",
    "[ fig : vrot.q ] , i present the rotation curves for this dm - halo family graphically .",
    "the lower panel shows the rotation curves for these dm - halo models , while in the top panel i present the ratio of the flattened to the round dm - halo rotation curve .",
    "although the residuals show systematic behavior , the amplitudes ( @xmath12 ) are smaller than the routinely obtained observational errors ( e.g. begeman 1989 , be89 hereafter ; broeils 1992 ) . in conclusion : rotation curves of flattened dm - halos are indistinguishable from their round equivalents .",
    "this family of flattened dm - halo models is fully specified by the equations ( [ eq : rc.versus.q ] ) and ( [ eq : rho0.versus.q ] ) which relate the core radius and the central density to the flattening of the dm - halo and is graphically presented in figure [ fig : rc.rho0.versus.q ] . for a given rotation curve ,",
    "flattened dm - halo models have larger core radii and central densities than their round equivalents .",
    "notice that both the central density and the core radius have an almost linear dependence on the halo flattening for moderately flattened dm - halos .",
    "of course the dm - halo model i have chosen to work with might very well be different from the true dm halo mass distribution",
    ". however all mass distributions , with similar rotation curves , share the general feature that flatter distributions have larger vertical forces . therefore , a dm halo flattening determined using the formalism outlined in this paper serves as an indicator of the true flattening of the ( unknown ) dark matter density distribution .",
    "as we can measure the light distribution of the stellar disk only , and have no a priori knowledge of the mass - to - light ratio of stellar disks , the relative contributions of luminous and dark matter are not known ( abbs85 and lf89 ) . however , as i will show in appendix b , the galaxy mass model described above is fully determined by _ one _ parameter regulating the relative importance of stars and dark matter .",
    "following bottema ( 1993 ) i choose this parameter , @xmath10 , to be the fraction of the peak observed rotation curve which is due to the stellar disk ( defined by eqn .",
    "[ [ eq : gamma.beta.definition ] ] ) .",
    "different choices of @xmath10 result in quite different values for the stellar mass - to - light ratio , the halo s central density and core radius . as an example ,",
    "i present the dependence of these three parameters on @xmath10 for the galaxy ngc 3198 ( rotation curve and optical parameters were taken from be89 ) in figure [ fig : disk.halo.conspiracy ] , and algebraically by the equations ( [ eq : moverl.versus.gamma ] ) , ( [ eq : rc.versus.gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : result.for.rho0 ] ) . in figure [ fig : disk.halo.conspiracy ] , i have also indicated how a 5% uncertainty in the slope of the rotation curve affects the results . to obtain the core radius and central density of a flattened dark halo , one uses the equations ( [ eq : rc.versus.gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : result.for.rho0 ] ) and multiplies these values by @xmath13 ( equation [ [ eq : rc.versus.q ] ] ) and @xmath14 ( equation [ [ eq : rho0.versus.q ] ] ) respectively .    in agreement with lf89",
    ", i find that observed equatorial rotation curves do not constrain the core radius of the dm - halo ( or @xmath10 in our terminology ) very well .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : rotcur.gamma ] , where i present the rotation curve of a model galaxy which resembles the sc galaxy , ngc 3198=207.1 l@xmath15/pc@xmath16 , @xmath17 kpc , @xmath18 kpc ) , gaseous surface density distribution and rotation curve ( v@xmath19 , v@xmath20 , v@xmath21 and v@xmath22 km / s ) were taken from be89 who used kent s ( 1987 ) photometry to calculate the rotation curve due to the stellar disk .",
    "the stellar disk is truncated at 6@xmath23 ( van der kruit , 1988 ) . ] .",
    "several acceptable fits , made with different @xmath10 s , are shown .    in conclusion : the parameterization of the disk - halo conspiracy , as presented in appendix b",
    ", provides a useful way to perform the disk - halo decomposition to acceptable accuracy , and allows for a straightforward way to investigate the dependence of the thickness of the gas layer on the @xmath10 value ( mass - to - light ratio ) of the stellar disk .",
    "in this section i derive the vertical distributions of the hi layer from the potential of the whole galaxy , @xmath24 , and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this derivation is subject to several simplifying assumptions which are listed below :    * the system is in steady state , * and is azimuthally symmetric . *",
    "the velocity dispersion tensor of the gas is symmetric and round , so that * the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is a good approximation to the vertical jeans equation . *",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion of the hi gas is constant ( isothermal ) with z - height . *",
    "magnetic and cosmic ray pressures are neglected    obviously this is just an approximate description of reality .",
    "spiral density waves violate the first two assumptions , while non - thermal pressure terms ( magnetic , cosmic ray heating , ... ) are not included in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium . keeping these assumptions in mind ,",
    "i take as the starting point the vertical jeans equation in cylindrical coordinates ( as usual , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 denote the radial , the tangential and the vertical direction respectively ) :    @xmath28     & & \\hspace*{-30mm}\\ ; { \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{r } \\;\\frac{\\partial   } { \\partial   r}$}}\\left ( r \\ ; \\rho { \\mbox{$\\sigma_{rz}^2 $ } } \\right )   -       { \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{r}\\;\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}$}}\\left ( \\rho { \\mbox{$\\sigma_{\\theta z}^2 $ } } \\right ) , \\label{eq : vertical.jeans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to determine the vertical distribution of the gas ( @xmath29 ) . here is the gravitational force ( per unit mass ) in the @xmath30-direction and @xmath31 the gaseous velocity dispersion . due to the assumption of azimuthal symmetry , the last term in equation ( [ eq : vertical.jeans ] ) vanishes .",
    "the @xmath32-term essentially measures the tilt of the velocity dispersion ellipsoid , for cylindrical rotation it is identically zero .",
    "in the most extreme case the velocity dispersion ellipsoid points towards the galactic center .    at small @xmath33 , @xmath32 is approximately @xmath34 so that its contribution is expected to be small and @xmath35 , as measured by malhotra s ( 1994 ) and blitz ( 1984 ) are almost equal : 7.8 @xmath36 3 versus 5.7 @xmath36 1.2 km / s . ] .",
    "thus , the non - diagonal terms of the velocity dispersion tensor ( i.e. ) will vanish .",
    "then , the vertical jeans equation reduces to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium :    @xmath37    with the assumption that the gas is isothermal in the z - direction it follows that :    @xmath38    so that    @xmath39 & & \\hspace*{2 mm }     \\approx \\rho_0 \\exp{(-z^2/2w_{gas}^2 ) } .",
    "\\label{eq : gas.width.approximate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see that the gaseous density distribution can be calculated once the gaseous velocity dispersion and the potential of the galaxy,@xmath24 , are known",
    ". generally speaking , the vertical distribution of the gas will not be a `` simple '' function of z. since the observational data does generally not allow for a more sophisticated analysis than the fitting of gaussian functions to the measurements , i choose to fit gaussians to the model density distributions ( eqn . [",
    "[ eq : rho.gas.z ] ] ) as well since the _ shape _ of the potential changes with galactocentric radius , the gaseous density distribution will also change shape .",
    "thus , the accuracy of the approximate density distribution ( eqn . [ [ eq : gas.width.approximate ] ] ) will also change with galactocentric radius .",
    "other indicators for the width of the gas layer could be used as well .",
    "for example the normalized second moment of the density distribution , @xmath40 is more sensitive to the high - z parts of the density distribution , yielding _ larger _ values for the `` width '' of the gas layer . on the other hand",
    ", the width could be calculated from the full width at half maximum ( @xmath41 ) , a calculation which is more sensitive to the low - z part of the density distribution , so that _ smaller _ values for the `` width '' are found .",
    "significant differences between these three width measures indicate that the true density distribution is not gaussian . for the toy model discussed below the @xmath42 and @xmath43 width estimators can be as much as 20% larger and smaller than @xmath44 respectively ( inside the optical disk ) . beyond the optical disk ,",
    "the gaseous distribution is close to gaussian . ] . in the remainder of this paper",
    "i will use the dispersion ( @xmath44 ) of this gaussian , as defined by eqn [ [ eq : gas.width.approximate ] ] , as a measure of the width of the gas layer .",
    "i incorporate three components in the present study : 1 ) a stellar disk with constant scale - height , 2 ) a flattened isothermal dm - halo , and 3 ) a gaseous disk .",
    "the stellar density distribution for the stars must be close to the one derived from surface brightness measurements by van der kruit & searle ( + vdks81a&b and vdks82a&b ) , namely :    @xmath45 & & \\hspace*{-1.5 cm }     = { \\mbox{${\\cal m / l}\\;$}}\\ ; \\rho_s(0,0 ) \\ ; e^{-r / h_r } \\ ; { \\rm sech}^2(z/2z_e )      \\hspace{5 mm } r \\leq r_{max } \\hspace{2 mm }     \\nonumber \\\\*[3 mm ] & & \\hspace*{-1.5 cm } =     0.0 \\hspace{2 mm } \\hspace*{4 cm }   r > r_{max } ,     \\label{eq : stars.rho.lum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the average mass per unit luminosity .",
    "note that barteldrees & dettmar 1993 ( bd93 ) find that the optical disks are truncated at significantly smaller radii : @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "in external galaxies it is very hard to observationally distinguish a sech - squared distribution from an exponential distribution ( i.e. wainscoat 1989 ) .",
    "for the galaxy on the other hand , there is a large body of evidence suggesting that the vertical distribution can be better represented by an exponential distribution slope , the exponential distribution has a twice larger value of the midplane density than the isothermal distribution ( see also van der kruit , 1988 ) . ] : @xmath50 ( gilmore & reid 1983 ; pritchet 1983 ; van der kruit 1986 ; yoshi 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , i calculate model potentials for the exponential distribution .",
    "i chose the flattened isothermal distribution as proposed by ss90 ( equation [ [ eq : rho.halo.rz ] ] ) , discussed above , to represent the dm - halo mass distribution .",
    "the vertical force of a truncated stellar disk as well as of a flaring disk is calculated from the potential :    @xmath51 ^ 2 + [ z - z']^2 \\right ) }     \\ ; \\ ; ,    \\label{eq : equation.for.kz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the density distribution for which to calculate the forces . at the center of the galaxy",
    ", @xmath53 equals @xmath54 , for all other galactocentric radii @xmath55 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind : @xmath56 , with @xmath57 $ ] . with special care for the region around @xmath58",
    "this integral can be solved numerically and takes about 8 seconds per point on a sparc 2 processor .",
    "i use an exponential for the vertical density distribution , @xmath59 , of the stars , while i approximate the gaseous distribution by a gaussian . as neither the vertical scale - height nor the midplane density , @xmath60 , are generally analytic functions , i store their values in tabular form and determine the interpolated value whenever the integrating routine ( qromb or qromo , press 1990 ) requires so .",
    "i used the double exponential stellar disk ( kuijken & gilmore , 1989 , hereafter kg89 , their eqn . [ 27 ] ) as a test case and found that the two methods of calculation agree to within 1 part in 1,000 .",
    "as a first step i use the radial part of the potential to determine the structural parameters of the stellar disk and dm - halo by requiring that they reproduce the observed equatorial rotation curve . the radial force due to the gas is calculated ( using the rotmod program in gipsy , van der hulst 1992 ) assuming that it is infinitely thin .",
    "i use the observed photometry and a constant ratio to calculate the rotation curve due to the stars ( also by using rotmod ) .",
    "i then perform the disk - halo decomposition outlined in appendix b.    i use the values for the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk and the core radius and central density of the dm - halo , as found in the disk - halo decomposition , to calculate the vertical force due to the stellar disk ( equation [ [ eq : equation.for.kz ] ] ) , and the dm - halo ( srjf94 s equation [ 6 ] ) .",
    "these forces are integrated numerically to yield the potential , from which the gaseous volume density distribution , @xmath61 , is calculated ( using eqn . [ [ eq : rho.gas.z ] ] , an assumed gaseous velocity dispersion , and an observed surface density distributions ) .",
    "i follow an iterative procedure , where the gaseous density distribution , calculated from an approximation to the true total potential , is used to estimate the gaseous contribution to the potential , which must then be added to the contributions from the stellar disk and dm - halo to yield a better approximation to the true total potential , from which a better approximation to true gaseous density distribution can be calculated , ... etc .",
    "thus , the vertical distribution of the gas is not fully consistent with the poisson equation    @xmath62    since i take the vertical distribution of the gas layer to be gaussian , and because the radial force ( @xmath63 ) due to a thick gas layer differs from the radial force arising from an infinitely thin disk .",
    "these inconsistency are expected to be small because of the small scale - height and low mass of the gaseous disk .",
    "this procedure to calculate the thickness of the gas layer is what i term the _",
    "global approach_.    in order for the global model to be self - consistent , the stellar velocity dispersion tensor ( , with @xmath64 all the possible coordinate combinations ) has to be such that for the assumed stellar density distribution and the calculated total potential , the vertical jeans equation ( [ eq : vertical.jeans ] ) will be satisfied .",
    "thus , every mass model described above makes two predictions , firstly the radial variation of the width of the gaseous layer , and secondly the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "in this paper i concentrate on the radial variation of the thickness of the gas layer .      to date",
    ", most authors have determined the distribution of the gas above the plane from the _ local _ mass densities only . in this section",
    "i compare this local approach with the global approach described in the previous section .",
    "to separate variables i will postpone investigating the effects of the gaseous self - gravity till  [ sec - gaseous - self - gravity ] .",
    "first i describe how in the local approach the vertical force is calculated from the local mass densities and gradients in the rotation curve . assuming that , in the region where the gas is found , the rotation speed does not depend on @xmath27-height and that the vertical force does not depend on radius , the poisson equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) reduces to the local poisson equation :    @xmath65    combining the appropriate equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ eq : isothermal.hydro.equil ] ) with the equation above ( [ eq : poisson.local ] ) i find :",
    "@xmath66    setting the rotation curve term to @xmath67 , it follows that :    @xmath68    negative and positive rotation densities ( @xmath67 ) correspond to rising and falling rotation curves respectively .",
    "the effect of a rising rotation curve is to increase the thickness of the gaseous and stellar disks , while in a falling rotation curve a disk will be thinner relative to the case where @xmath69 .",
    "bottema ( 1987 ) find that the rotation term can contribute significantly in the rising parts of galactic rotation curves .",
    "for the case of a flat rotation curve , equation ( 9 ) leads to the plane - parallel - sheet case .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rho.from.local.approx ] ) can be solved either iteratively or analytically ( if more simplifications are introduced ) : the multi - component and gaussian - equivalent methods described below .      in order to arrive at the ( analytic ) gaussian - equivalent method , we simplify matters further by assuming that the self - gravity of the gas is negligible and that the total mass density does not vary significantly with height above the plane .",
    "i then arrive at :    @xmath70    so that the vertical distribution is gaussian with dispersion @xmath71 :    @xmath72    for which the following relation holds :    @xmath73    in the gaussian - equivalent method one then assumes that the gaussian width ( @xmath71 ) can be equated with the observed width @xmath44(@xmath74 , as defined by eqn .",
    "[ [ eq : gas.width.approximate ] ] ) , so that the inferred midplane mass density ( @xmath75 ) is given by :    @xmath76    inside the stellar disk , the gaussian width ( @xmath71 ) will always be smaller then the true width because , for any density distribution , the volume density decreases with z - height . the inferred midplane mass density , as calculated from the true width @xmath44 ( which is larger than @xmath71 ) and equation ( [ eq : gas.width.most.local ] ) , will therefore underestimate the true midplane mass density .",
    "this effects is illustrated in figure [ fig : rho.local.approx ] , where i plot the ratio of the inferred midplane mass density ( @xmath75 ) and the actual midplane density ( @xmath77 ) . for several mass models resembling ngc 3198 ,",
    "this method recovers @xmath78 to @xmath79 % of the true midplane density . especially for the round halo case ( @xmath80 )",
    "we clearly see the effects of the truncation of the stellar disk at @xmath81 .",
    "the truncation of the stellar disk of ngc 3198 occurs at a relatively large distance ( @xmath82 versus @xmath83 on average , vdks81a&b and vdks82a&b , and bd93 ) so that it s effect may be relatively small for ngc 3198 . on the other hand , the effects of the truncation of the stellar disk are smaller if the vertical distribution of the stars is sech@xmath16 rather than exponential ( i.e. less concentrated towards the midplane ) .",
    "it should be noted that these results depend somewhat on the width estimator being used ( see footnote [ footnote.width.estimator ] ) , for example the radial variation of @xmath84 arrises partly because the vertical distribution of the gas gradually changes from a distribution which is strongly centrally peaked ( in the inner two scale - lengths ) to a gaussian ( beyond the optical disk ) .    including the rotation density will improve the gaussian - equivalent method beyond the truncation of the optical disk ( right - hand side panel ) . the radial variation in the density ratio beyond the optical disk results from small scale structure in the model rotation curve .",
    "however , this is possible only if the sum of the rotation and dm densities is larger than zero ( see eqn .",
    "[ [ eq : gas.width.gaussian - equivalent ] ] and appendix [ sec-appendix.local.approach ] ) .",
    "for example , this is _ not _ the case for a maximum - disk model of ngc 3198 in the inner two radial scale - lengths .",
    "although its accuracy varies systematically with radius , the gaussian - equivalent method works reasonably well , especially beyond the stellar disk .",
    "the difference between the plane - parallel - sheet case and the global approach is most easily illustrated by plotting the vertical forces for the two cases . in figure",
    "[ fig : kz.all ] @xmath85 i plot the forces , as calculated for a ngc 3198-model , for a selection of radii .",

    "the width of the gas layer is largely independent of the dm - halo flattening because the potential there is dominated by the stellar disk .",
    "however , for models with flatter halos and/or lower-@xmath10 stellar disks , the halo can be of importance inside the stellar disk ( see  [ sec - the - multi - component - method ] , and figure [ fig : kz.all ] ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the self - gravity of the gas is more important for the rounder dm - halo models (  [ sec - gaseous - self - gravity ] and compare the figures [ fig : kz.halo]-a and [ fig : kz.halo]-b ) .",

    "it is instructive to see how uncertainties in gaseous velocity dispersion and uncertainties in the derivation of the vertical force affect our estimates of the dm - halo flattening .",
    "another point of interest is to investigate what differences may arise when using the local instead of the global approach .    to summarize the following sections : the errors introduced by using the gaussian - equivalent method ( typically a 10 - 30% too round halo ) tend to cancel out those introduced by neglecting the self - gravity of the gas ( 20 - 60% too flat a halo ) .      in many practical situations",
    "it may be that measurements of the gaseous velocity dispersion are not available .",
    "this severely limits our ability to determine the flattening of the dm - halo . in some face - on galaxies",
    "the azimuthally averaged gaseous velocity dispersion is observed to decline radially from around 12 km / s in the center to remain constant at 7 km / s beyond @xmath102 ( van der kruit & shostak 1982 ; dickey 1990 ) . in other systems , the region beyond @xmath102 , as well as",

    "the measurements to date indicate that the gaseous velocity dispersion beyond the optical disk has a value of around 7 km / s .    overestimating the gaseous velocity dispersion by a factor of @xmath103 causes an overestimate of the midplane mass density by a factor of @xmath104 . beyond the optical disk ,",
    "too flat a dm - halo distribution would be inferred ( by the same factor @xmath105 ) .      here",
    "i estimate the effects of neglecting certain components to the vertical force ( e.g. the self - gravity of the atomic gas , magnetic forces , or the gravitational force due to some remote point source ) . a mass - model which uses an underestimate of the true vertical force",
    "requires a larger dm density and thus a smaller values of the halo flattening to reproduce the observed gas layer widths .",
    "thus , underestimating the vertical force by a factor @xmath106 results in too small an estimate for the halo flattening ( by a factor @xmath107 $ ] ) .",
    "the inverse is true when working with an overestimate of the vertical force .    neglecting the self - gravity of the neutral atomic gas , which can typically contribute 30 % to the vertical force (  [ sec - gaseous - self - gravity ] and figure [ fig : kz.halo ] ) , will result in a 30 % too small inferred halo flattening . since the known molecular gas content of galaxies rarely exceeds 10% of the stellar mass ( which contributes roughly 20% to at large distances , see  [ sec - the - local - approach ] and figure [ fig : kz.all ] ) , and is confined to the inner parts of the galaxy like the stars , i expect that neglecting the molecular gas will result in an underestimate of @xmath0 by at most 2% .",
    "application of the gaussian - equivalent method to an observed set of gas layer widths underestimates the inferred midplane density by a radially varying amount ( see  [ sec - the - local - approach ] , and figure [ fig : rho.local.approx ] ) . as a result",
    "the inferred halos will be too round and have core radii that are too large .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen that a flattened dark halo imprints a very specific signature on the flaring of the gas - layer ( figure [ fig : wgas.beyond.rmax ] ) .",
    "measurement of this flaring allows for the determination of the dm - halo flattening .",
    "although the global approach is limited by some of the same assumptions as the local approach ( isothermality of the gas , zero non - thermal pressure terms , constant -ratio of the stellar disk , alignment between dm - halo and stellar disk , ... ) , it treats some other aspects much better ( radial gradients in stellar surface density , the effects of the rising rotation curve , the non - cylindrical symmetry of the potential , ... ) .",
    "in particular the region where the rotation curve rises sharply and the region where the stellar disk truncates are better analyzed using the global approach . in those parts where the rotation curve is ` flat ' and which are not too close to the truncation of the stellar disk",
    "the gaussian - equivalent and multi - component methods can be used to reasonable accuracy .",
    "however , the global approach is less sensitive to small scale irregularities ( figure [ fig : wgas.global.versus.local ] ) . to obtain reliable results , any applied method _ must _ include the self - gravity of the gas .",
    "therefore , i propose that the more robust global approach (  [ sec-the.global.approach ] ) should be used in programs aimed at determining the flattening of the dark matter halo . for",
    "a set of global mass distributions with varying halo flattening one can calculate the flaring behaviour of the gaseous disk .",
    "the dm - halo model exhibiting the best agreement between calculated and observed gas - layer widths then yields the halo flattening .",
    "the accuracy of the determined flattening can be gauged by varying the structural parameters of the individual mass components .",
    "since the velocity dispersion of the gas is a crucial parameter in the analysis , care must be taken to determine its radial dependence .",
    "this will be done done in a forthcoming paper where i will analyze the flaring gas layer of thee almost edge - on galaxy ngc 4244 .",
    "nearby edge - on spiral galaxies with large ( extending beyond the optical disk ) neutral hydrogen envelopes are possible targets for studies of this kind .",
    "symmetric systems are preferred since it is more likely that such systems are in equilibrium .",
    "furthermore suitable systems should not exhibit strong warping . for systems with moderate warps",
    ", the kinematical information can be used to disentangle flaring from warping .",
    "unfortunately these kind of systems might be rare .    in order to investigate the possibility of determining the thickness of the gas - layer in less inclined systems",

    "the line of sight ) . in the thin disk model , i constrained the gas - layer to have a fwhm of 100 pc everywhere , while in the flaring disk model the gas - layer has a vertical distribution calculated using the multi - component method ( including the self - gravity of the gas , eqn . [",
    "[ eq : solution.of.zrho ] ] ) .",
    "both models were calculated with a gaseous velocity dispersion of 7.5 km / s . for a given set of observational parameters ( 15@xmath85 beam [ @xmath109 700 pc ] and 2.56 km / s velocity resolution )",
    "i calculate the intensities originating from all points in the model galaxy for all velocities . taking the normalized second moment with respect to radial",
    "velocity yields the apparent velocity dispersion for all points in the model galaxy . in figure",
    "[ fig : second.moment ]  i present the two model velocity dispersion maps .",
    "the systematic differences , of the order of 5 km / s , arise due to the fact that a line of sight through a flaring disk samples a wider range in position angle and galactocentric radius than the line of sight through a thin disk . in principle",
    ", the gaseous velocity dispersion can be determined after the layer - thickness - effects are corrected for .",
    "the thickness of the gas layer can be derived by comparing individual channel maps .",
    "contour maps of a particular channel are presented in figure [ fig : channel.map ] : in the top panel the thin disk map is shown , the middle panel shows the thick disk equivalent while the difference between the two is contoured in the lower panel . due to its larger vertical scale - height",
    ", the projected width of the thick - disk channel map should be larger than that of the thin - disk , while the average surface brightness will be reduced .",
    "this signature of the thick disk is easily recognized in the displayed contour maps .",
    "furthermore , contrary to edge - on galaxies , the flaring can be measured in many different channel maps so that local irregularities ( e.g. spiral streaming motions , bubbles , ... ) are less likely to hamper the determination of the radial behaviour of the flaring ( cf . olling & van gorkom , 1995 ) .",
    "therefore i expect that it must be possible to experimentally determine both the gaseous velocity dispersion and the thickness of the gas - layer for moderately inclined systems as well",
    ".      it might be possible to test the importance of neglected physics in galaxies where the rotation curve falls in keplerian manner .",
    "in such systems the contribution of the dark matter to the global potential is presumably small , thereby eliminating the gas layer thickness dependence on the shape of the dm - halo . as a result",
    "the thickness of the gas layer should depend on the total visible mass of the galaxy and the gaseous velocity dispersion only .",
    "some galaxies exhibit falling rotation curves , albeit not in keplerian manner ( casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; broeils 1992 )",
    ".    the measured width of the gas layer can then be compared with model predictions .",
    "if the gas layer is observed to be thicker than predicted , one might conclude that magnetic and cosmic ray pressures are important . on the other hand",
    ", a gas layer thinner than predicted indicates that either the ionizing extra - galactic radiation field is important ( e.g. maloney 1993 ) , or that an unseen disk - like dm component is present ( i.e. the `` clumpuscules '' proposed by pfenniger 1994a , and pfenniger & combes 1994b ) .",
    "i have investigated the use of accurate determination of the thickness of the hi - layer in external galaxies . in combination with constraints set by the gaseous velocity dispersion and the rotation curve",
    ", i find that in principle it is possible to determine the shape of dm - halos .",
    "the gaseous self - gravity contributes significantly to the vertical force field ( up to 40% ) but can be modeled accurately using the global approach (  [ sec-the.global.approach ] ) outlined in this paper .",
    "the thus determined halo flattening is independent of the particular choice of disk - halo decomposition .    in practice (",
    "not necessarily edge - on ) systems with extended hi - disks and regular velocity fields should be used , provided that they are observed with high angular and velocity resolution .",

    "as mentioned before , it is not possible to constrain the dm - halo flattening by measurements of the equatorial rotation curve since both round and flattened mass distributions can generate the same rotation curve . in this appendix",
    "i show that the dm - halo model used by sackett & sparke ( 1990 ) :    @xmath110    ( where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the dm - halo core radius , central density and flattening respectively ) defines a one - parameter family of halo models with essentially the same equatorial rotation curve if core radius and central density depend in a specific way on this one parameter , @xmath0 ( equations [ [ eq : rc.versus.q ] ] and [ [ eq : rho0.versus.q ] ] respectively ) .",

    "evaluating this relation in the midplane , i find that the equatorial rotation curve arising from a flattened dm - halo is given by :    @xmath113    with    @xmath114 & &     \\left\\ { 1 -         \\left ( \\frac{g(q)}{\\arctan{g(q ) } } \\right )         \\left ( \\frac {   q^2 r_c^2(q)}{r^2+(1-q^2)r_c^2(q ) } \\right )        \\arctan { \\left ( \\frac{r^2+(1-q^2)r_c^2(q)}{q^2 r_c^2(q)}\\right ) }     \\right\\ } \\ ; ,     \\label{eq : v2.radvar } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath115    while @xmath116 and @xmath117 are given by :    @xmath118    it is easily verified that equation ( [ eq : v2.r.q ] ) indeed yields the familiar + @xmath119  , the rotation curve due to a round halo .",

    "it is found that the rotation curves of flattened dm - halos reproduce the rotation curve of a round halo to within 7 % ( for @xmath1300.2 ) .",
    "this error is maximal for @xmath131 , changes sign at @xmath123 and slowly drops from -2% at two core radii to 0% at infinity .",
    "since these deviations are large in the region where rotation curves are determined , such accuracy is not acceptable for our purpose .",
    "a little experimentation leads to a solution which is more acceptable : our best approximation ( errors @xmath132 1.4% ) to the dependence of halo core radius and central density on its flattening @xmath0 is graphically presented in figure [ fig : rc.rho0.versus.q ] and algebraically below :    @xmath133 & = &    r_c(1 ) \\times { \\cal c}(q ) \\ ; ,     \\label{eq : rc.versus.q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath134 & = & \\rho_{h,0}(1 ) \\times { \\cal h}(q )       \\hspace{1 cm } \\approx \\hspace{1 cm }      \\left ( \\frac{\\rho_{h,0}(1)}{q } \\right ) \\ ; ,     \\label{eq : rho0.versus.q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath135 and @xmath136 . substituting ( [ eq : rho0.versus.q ] ) , ( [ eq : rc.versus.q ] ) and ( [ eq : f.q ] ) into equation ( [ eq : rho.halo.rz ] ) , i find that at large distances the local dm - halo densities are roughly proportional to @xmath137 .",

    "since the light distribution of the stellar disk is relatively well known , the first step in tackling the disk - halo conspiracy is the description of the rotation curve due to the stellar disk . when assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio , the stellar density distribution can be described , to first order , as radially exponential and vertically thin .",
    "the amplitude of the rotation curve due to such a thin exponential stellar disk depends only on its central surface density and radial scale length .",

    "<S> i present a new method of deriving the shape of the dark matter ( dm ) halos of spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the method relies on the comparison of model predictions with high spectral and spatial resolution hi observations of the gas layer . </S>",
    "<S> so far , determinations of the flaring of the gas layer ( i.e. the increase of the thickness with galactocentric radius ) have been used to determine the mass - to - light ratio , , of the stellar disk of several edge - on galaxies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> i describe a method which can be used to determine the shape of dm - halos . </S>",
    "<S> this technique will be applied in a forthcoming paper .    </S>",
    "<S> i show that the model predictions of the gas layer width are best calculated using a global approach , in which the potential arising from the _ total _ mass distribution of the galaxy is used in the calculation of the vertical distribution of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> i developed a new algorithm to calculate the force field of an arbitrary , azimuthally symmetric , density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm is used to calculate the forces due to the radially truncated stellar disk as well as of the flaring gas layer .    </S>",
    "<S> i use a simple two - parameter family of disk - halo models which have essentially the same observed equatorial rotation curve but different vertical forces . </S>",
    "<S> this mass model is composed of a stellar disk with constant , and a dm - halo with a given axial ratio ( sackett & sparke [ apj , 1990 , 361 , 408 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> i approximate the radial force due to the gaseous disk , and iteratively determine the vertical force due to the global distribution of the gas .    in agreement with maloney [ apj , 414 </S>",
    "<S> , 41 , 1993 ] i find that beyond the holmberg radius , the thickness of the gaseous disk is sensitive to both the flattening of the dm - halo and the self - gravity of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> i also show that the inferred dm - halo flattening is not sensitive to the particular choice of disk - halo decomposition .    </S>",
    "<S> i show that the determination of the thickness of the gas layer is not restricted to edge - on galaxies , but can be measured for moderately inclined systems as well . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in combination with detailed modeling , high resolution hi imaging of nearby galaxies with extended hi envelopes will enable us to determine the shape of the dm halo of these galaxies .    </S>",
