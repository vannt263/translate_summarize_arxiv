    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) . at radio wavelengths it exhibits a peculiar bended large scale ( @xmath7  kpc ) structure and",
    "an apparent superluminal motion has been noticed in mas  scale subcomponents of its jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xmath8rays",
    "a counterpart was found by rosat @xcite , and in @xmath9rays by egret @xcite .    in the high energy range ,",
    "pks  1222 + 216 has recently shown a particularly active behaviour with flares also in the very high energy domain ( vhe , i.e. @xmath10  gev ) . in april 2009",
    "a first outburst was reported by the fermi large area telescope @xcite followed , in december 2009 , by a larger one observed by both the agile gamma - ray imaging detector @xcite and fermi @xcite . a further flare in april 2010",
    "reached the vhe @xcite .",
    "this triggered several observations in the tev region with the ground based cherenkov telescopes veritas and magic , which were unsuccessful .",
    "the source was finally detected with magic in june 2010 @xcite , in coincidence with a second huge gev emission recorded by agile and fermi @xcite .",
    "pks  1222 + 216 is the third fsrq , after 3c279 ( z=0.536 ) and pks  1510 - 089 ( z=0.36 ) , observed at such high energy .",
    "the 30  minutes observation by magic allows a measurement of a variability time  scale of about 10  minutes .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the object and the high variability imply that the jet is relativistic with large beaming factors .",
    "@xcite suggest that the origin of the rapidly variable vhe energy emission arose in a small region outside the broad line region ( blr ) : if this emission were produced within the blr , the high energy photons would be strongly absorbed by photons from emission lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively a more exotic scenario that considers photon / axion transition was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the optical and nir emission of pks  1222 + 216 had shown high daily fluctuations , that are not always related to the @xmath9ray variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we analyse the optical observations of pks  1222 + 216 .",
    "we study the variability of both continuum and emission lines . from the lines",
    "luminosity we deduce the thermal continuum and contrast it with the highly variable jet component .",
    "finally we estimate the virial mass of the black hole from different recipes and lines ( i.e. , mgii , h@xmath2 , and h@xmath3 ) and compare it with the literature results .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider a concordance cosmology with h@xmath11  km / s / mpc , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]",
    "in the usual unification scheme of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the relativistic jet of a blazar is viewed closely along the observer line of sight .",
    "thus , the continuum in radio to optical / uv spectral range is dominated by a highly polarised non  thermal synchrotron radiation emitted by the energetic electrons in the jet superimposed to the thermal emission associated to the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and specifically for pks  1222 + 216 @xcite ) .    in the last three years covered by the data , the continuum luminosity at 5100  varied in the range",
    "the reosc photometry , collected before 2003 , corresponds to a status of minimum activity ( v@xmath14 ) . from these data we infer an average colour index which , assuming a power  law optical spectrum @xmath15 , translates into a spectral index @xmath16",
    "this implies a flat optical spectrum in the @xmath17 versus @xmath18 plot , suggesting a prevailing contribution of thermal emission from the accretion disc over the synchrotron one .",
    "@xcite have shown that the h@xmath2 luminosity in the steward observatory sample is practically constant while the continuum is highly variable ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this is is in good agreement with the sdss and tng spectra ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 luminosity mean value is @xmath19  erg / s with an rms of  @xmath20  erg / s .",
    "as noted by @xcite the constancy of the h@xmath2 line indicates that the broad line region is marginally affected by the huge variability of the jet .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by our analysis that consider a larger number of spectra .        in order to evaluate the mass of the black hole we consider the virial approach by assuming the fwhm as a measure of the virial velocity and the thermal continuum luminosity as a proxy for the distance of the clouds from the black hole , since the observed continuum may be dominated by the jet emission .",
    "we calculate the thermal continuum through the relation with broad line luminosities found on qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we calibrate the ratio for h@xmath2 and continuum at 5100  basing on the @xcite qso property catalogue .",
    "the low luminosities objects ( @xmath21 ) show a significant contamination from the host galaxy a thus are removed from the analysis .",
    "a similar cut is applied also to the luminosity of the lines , since faint lines are less reliable due to the contaminations from narrow emission .",
    "average and rms values of the ratio are : @xmath22 the thermal continuum deduced from h@xmath2 line luminosity ( @xmath23  erg / s with an rms of @xmath24  erg / s ) corresponds to the lower observed states of table  [ tab:1 ] ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the virial mass can be expressed as : @xmath25 where the coefficients @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , calibrated on local agn with an estimate of the mass through the reverberation mapping technique , depend on the broad line considered .",
    "the uncertainties associated to these measures of the mass are very large ( @xmath29  dex ) and are dominated by the dispersion of the relations between the radius of the blr and the thermal continuum luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to compare different estimate we consider calibrations presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "average black hole masses estimated for each emission line are in table  [ tab:1 ] , and in figure  [ fig:4 ] we compare the various recipes considered to determine these values .",
    "our measurements are consistent with @xmath30 , regardless of the relation considered .",
    "we investigate the variability of broad lines of pks  1222 + 216 through the analysis of spectra collected in a period of more than 3 years .",
    "the h@xmath2 line remains almost unchanged despite multiple flaring in both optical and @xmath9rays .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario proposed by @xcite in which the intense and rapidly variable vhe emission is located at large distance ( @xmath31  pc ) from the blr ( but see : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since the blr emission is almost stable , we estimate the virial black hole mass following various recipes , and from mgii , h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 , we find that is @xmath32 .",
    "this mass is close to that proposed by @xcite on the basis of sdss continuum which in fact corresponded to a low state , but it is significantly higher than the mass proposed by @xcite and reported by @xcite .",
    "this possibly derives from @xcite , where however no information is reported on the fwhm of h@xmath2 .",
    "the black hole mass of pks  1222 + 216 does not substantially deviate from the mass distribution of the populations of fsrq at the same redshift ( @xmath33 , * ? ? ?",
    "because of its redshift we expect that dedicated infrared observations of the source with a medium size telescope should enable the detection of the host galaxy , in particular in case of low optical ",
    "nir emission activity : i.e. if the nuclear luminosity does not overcome the host galaxy luminosity by more than a factor of @xmath34 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
