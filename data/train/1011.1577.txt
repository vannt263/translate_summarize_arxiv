    "recently , this program has been realized in details for single - photon and single - mode states .",
    "the method of manipulating overall group delay mismatches between interacting in a multilayered structures ( superlattice structures ) by compensating dispersive effects in nonlinear segments by chosen linear segments have been developed @xcite for synthesis of twin photon states . in this way",
    ", the demonstration of heralded single photons prepared in pure quantum states from a spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) has been done in series of papers @xcite and engineering of quantum - optical state has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "there are some attempts to expand this strategy for producing heralded two - photon polarization entangled states , since one promising approach to the practical realization many of these tasks relies on qubits that are encoded in the polarization states of single photons .",
    "it was shown that the production of one heralded polarization entangled photon pair using only conventional down - conversion sources , linear optical elements , and projective measurements requires at least three initial pairs @xcite . an experimental scheme for producing heralded two - photon entanglement , which relies on triple - pair emission from a single down - conversion source",
    "was proposed @xcite and experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "it has an important goal of quantum optics to realize effective sources producing three - photon entangled states . up to now",
    ", several physical systems have been proposed for the direct generation of photon triplet including cascaded spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite , quantum dots @xcite as well as electron - positron annihilation @xcite .",
    "experimentally , three - photon down - conversion was studied in third - order nonlinear media @xcite and also by using cascaded second - order nonlinear parametric processes @xcite .",
    "most recently , direct generation of photon triplets using cascaded photon - pairs has been demonstrated in periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppnl ) crystals @xcite",
    ". this process will initiate new class of experiments in quantum information technologies using photons .",
    "full characterization of a three - photon greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state using quantum state tomography has been performed @xcite .",
    "very recently , the distinction of three - photon ghz and w states entangled in time and space has been reported by comparing the second - order and third - order correlation functions @xcite . as an application of this approach a method of generation of a narrowband three - photon w state entangled in time ( or energy ) via two four - wave mixing processes in cold atomic gas media has also been proposed and studied @xcite . it was also shown that quantum - optical states based on three - photon down - conversion can be effectively generated in cascaded optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) .",
    "the cascaded opo was proposed @xcite and experimentally realized by using the dual - grid method of quasi - phase matching ( qpm ) @xcite .",
    "this scheme that involves cascading second - order nonlinearities is based on parametric processes of splitting and summing in which the frequencies between the pump and two subharmonics frequencies are in the ratio of 3 : 2 : 1 .",
    "this cascaded configuration is different from the ones proposed in the cited papers .",
    "it involves the fundamental mode driven by an external pump field at the frequency @xmath2 and two subharmonic modes @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "a remarkable feature of opo is comparatively low generation threshold @xcite in comparison with the scheme of direct intracavity three - photon down - conversion , where the pump power threshold is determined by third - order susceptibility @xcite .",
    "another remarkable feature is formation of three phase locked states for both subharmonic modes equally spaced by @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider semiclassical- and quantum - properties of photon triplets generated in cascaded parametric process noted above : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this setup offer a variant of the scheme realized in the experiment @xcite and leads to generation of triple photons with approximately equal frequencies . in this way two physical cases",
    "will be considered : ( a ) cascaded spontaneous parametric three - photon splitting in a `` superlattice '' of nonlinear and anisotropic linear segments pumped by an ultrashort pulse ; ( b ) amplification of these processes in the presence of an optical cavity .",
    "thus , in the first part of this paper we propose detailed studies of quasi - phase matching in cascaded configurations considering complex nonlinear structures for simultaneously phase matching of two parametric processes in optical lattices .",
    "we consider dual - grid structure that involve periodically poled crystals for effective generation of photon triplets as in the experiment @xcite , as well as we propose the analogical scheme for preparation of the three - photon ghz polarization entangled states .",
    "we also consider dual - grid structures with second - order nonlinear and linear materials for generation of photon triplet with arbitrary joint spectrum . in this way we analyze the production of heralded two - photon polarization entanglement in such superlattice by using the conditional method of detection of auxiliary photons .",
    "for this goal the various cases of the spectral factorization of three - photon amplitude are analyzed in details .",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted to studies of cascaded opo on the base of the above analysis . in the cited papers @xcite the general theory of opo",
    "has been developed , however , without any concretization of the effective coupling constants between modes subharmonics that are characterized by the wave - vector mismatches of the parametric processes @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here , we consider these points in details . besides this , the lasing of `` three - photon '' mode is investigated in transition through the generation threshold .",
    "this investigation includes also analysis of quantum statistics of modes i.e. photon number distributions , third - order correlation functions and the wigner function for short interaction time as well as for over transition regime of opo , when dissipative effects are included .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the hamiltonian of the system and derive three - photon state through qpm concurrent nonlinearities . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly describe three - wave type - ii interaction in nonlinear superlattice structures , analyze generation of photon triplet in periodically poled nonlinear crystals ( ppnc ) and propose the scheme for preparation of ghz - states . in sec .",
    "iv we derive the conditions for spectral factorization of the three - photon amplitude .",
    "section v is devoted to the analysis of cascaded opo .",
    "we present the results on photon - number distributions , third - order correlation function of photon - numbers and the wigner functions for subharmonic modes of opo for both short interaction time and steady - state regime .",
    "in this section , we consider multiple optical interactions in @xmath8 nonlinear media , leading to the simultaneous quasi - phase matching ( qpm ) of two parametric processes .",
    "we investigate in details the cascaded processes of three - photon splitting and summing that lead particularly to the three - photon down - conversion . in the scheme the pump field at the frequency @xmath2 , which converts to the subharmonics at the central frequencies : @xmath4 and @xmath3 throughout two cascaded processes : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "note , that a complete description of photon triplet requires that all degrees of freedom associated with the quantized electromagnetic field of the occupied optical modes must be taken into account .",
    "the specification of the photons involves their polarization , their wave - vector @xmath9 and frequency or their spatial and time dependence .",
    "the dispersion relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath10 reduces one degree of freedom , such that dependence from the transverse wavevectors @xmath11 should be taken in account . in this way",
    ", the transverse correlations in tripartite entanglement have been studied in the paper @xcite .",
    "complete description in which the source produces three - photon states in different modes entangled in time and space has been done in the cited paper @xcite .",
    "analogous multimode calculations for cascading parametric systems in the layered media seem to be complicated and can be carried out only by numerical means .",
    "however , the full discussion of all degrees of freedom is beyond the scope of this paper , for the further discussion we assume that the spatial modes of the pdc photon pairs are independently decorrelated .",
    "we proceed from the single - mode approximation that selects only a single transverse spatial mode for the purpose of this paper .",
    "thus , we consider collinear , one - dimensional configurations focusing on studies of spectral correlations and polarization entanglement . such spatial decorrelation can be achieved , for example , by waveguides @xcite , in which the photons may be emitted only into specific transversely - confined modes . on the other hand ,",
    "one - dimensional collinear approach used here is also fully consistent for consideration of cascaded pdc , which generates three - photon states in the presence of an optical cavity .",
    "this analysis will be presented in sec.v .",
    "thus , in the discussed approach the hamiltonian of three - wave interaction reads as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the second - order susceptibility of the one - dimensional medium of length @xmath14 .",
    "the electric field operator @xmath15 is the superposition of the three components corresponding to the pump field @xmath16 and the fields of two subharmonics consisting of positive @xmath17 and negative @xmath18 frequency electric field operators ( @xmath19 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we also omit polarization states of electromagnetic fields and polarization indexes of nonlinear coefficient .",
    "the polarization states of modes will be considered in sections iii and iv . in this case , the field operators obey @xmath20 where @xmath21 , ( @xmath19 ) are subharmonic modes operators , while classical pump field reads as @xmath22 in these equations , @xmath23 is the normalized factor , where @xmath24 is the refractive index of the medium at the given frequency , @xmath25 is the cross section area of the beams , @xmath26 .",
    "the fields have frequencies centered on carried frequencies @xmath27 whose bandwidths @xmath28 are narrow in comparison to the central frequencies @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 .    note , that below we consider generation of photon triplet due to cascading @xmath8 processes but not due to direct @xmath29 interaction .",
    "in this approach the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is written trough the elementary @xmath8 interactions that correspond to the processes : @xmath6 and @xmath7 while three - photon down - conversion @xmath30 is calculated in the standard manner ( see , for example , @xcite ) in the second - order of the perturbation theory on @xmath8 , ( see , formula ( [ psd ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of the system that describes nonlinear @xmath8 interactions under the rotating - wave approximation and for neglecting the dependencies from the transverse wave - vectors is calculated as @xmath31    @xmath32    here and upwards , we use new denotations for the fields operators : @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",

    "this hamiltonian is presented in the general form that includes dispersion of interacting waves .",
    "below it will be concretized for multilayered nonlinear structures with different susceptibilities of nonlinearity and with different refractive indexes , pumped by the pulse laser light beam with gaussian distribution @xmath39 we apply now eq.([bham ] ) for investigation of three - photon states in the cascaded processes @xmath40 .",
    "the amplitude of this process can be calculated in the second - order of the perturbation theory with hamiltonian ( [ bham ] ) .",
    "the vector state in the second - order of the perturbation theory is described in the dyson series as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are vacuum states of the modes at the frequencies @xmath44 and @xmath45 . by using the expressions ( [ bham ] )",

    "three - photon down - conversion is controlled by energy conservation between the pump and daughter photons @xmath54 , while the amplitude is determined by the pump spectral amplitude and the phase - matching functions .    for the case of degenerate three - photon down - conversion :",
    "@xmath55 the maximum of this amplitude is realized in the range of resonance @xmath56 . in this case",
    "the eq.([fim ] ) approximately reduces to the result    @xmath57    note , that the approximated result ( [ fipd ] ) can be directly obtained from eq.([psd ] ) if we use the teylor type time - ordering instead of the dyson series expansion .",
    "the basis of this approximation for the parametric processes has been also discussed in @xcite .",
    "below , we represent application of these results for effective generation of photon triplet @xcite , for preparation of both three - photon ghz entangled states and the heralded polarization states .",
    "in this section we first briefly discuss three - wave type - ii interaction in one - dimensional @xmath8 nonlinear composite media , consisting of alternating layers with different coefficients of nonlinearity . in this case",
    ", the interaction hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) can be expressed as the sum of interactions in each layer in terms of the electric fields in @xmath58th layer , @xmath59 , @xmath60    @xmath61    where @xmath35 is the second - order nonlinearity . in approximation that the effects of refraction from the each layers are small the classical pump field @xmath62 and the positive frequency parts of the fields of the subharmonics : @xmath60 ( @xmath19 ) can be expressed as @xmath63    @xmath64    the electric fields ( [ ep ] ) , ( [ en ] ) have been studied in @xcite for one dimensional composite materials . in the case of composite layered structure the coupling function : @xmath65 ( and/or @xmath66 ) , ( see eqs.([zt]),([qsi ] ) ) could be rewritten in the following form ( see , the paper @xcite ) @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the second - order susceptibility in the @xmath69-th layer , @xmath70 is the length and @xmath71 is the phase mismatch vector for the @xmath69-th layer .",
    "it is easy to generalize these results on the case when polarization structure of three - wave interaction is important .",
    "note , that in this case we should not include a summing on the polarization indexes in the formula ( [ h1 ] ) , if the phase matching of three - waves interaction should take place in each @xmath69th layer only for the concrete combinations of three indexes : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 . in this case , the tensor of second - order susceptibility @xmath75 reduced to @xmath76 susceptibility in the @xmath69th layer . however , in this case the phase mismatch vector for the @xmath69th layer @xmath71 also depends on the indexes @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "note , that this result is convenient for realizing various schemes of qpm , in particular , for description of periodically poled nonlinear structures .",
    "the technique of quasi - phase - matching ( qpm ) and the availability of multiple gratings in a single periodically poled nonlinear crystal ( ppnc ) offer flexibility in achieving multiple interactions , which provide enhanced functionality of nonlinear optical devices .    as has been mentioned in sec .",
    "ii the maxima of the three - photon process depend on maxima of coupling constants of the each cascading process .",
    "perfect qpm is the condition for the effective process implementation .",
    "thus , in the subsection a qpm of cascading three - photon process : @xmath77 , @xmath78 is considered in the complex nonlinear structures with dual - gratings , while the subsection b is devoted to investigation of frequency - uncorrelated photon triplet and subsection generation , c involves patterns of preparation polarization entangled ghz states in such structures .      in this subsection",
    "we develop the theoretical approach of the cascaded generation of photon triplets , particularly , obtained experimentally in @xcite .",
    "we analyzed so called dual - grid nonlinear crystal in frame of mismatching of two spdc processes .",
    "the crystal consists of two periodically poled nonlinear segments with different periods .",
    "first segment involves @xmath79 domains of the length @xmath80 , with positive @xmath81 and negative @xmath82 susceptibilities which are interchanged one to other and refractive index @xmath83 ( corresponding phase - matching function is @xmath84 ) , and the second segment consists of @xmath85 domains of the length @xmath86 again with positive @xmath81 and negative @xmath82 susceptibilities and refractive index @xmath87 ( corresponding phase - matching function is @xmath88 ) .",
    "the crystal is pumped by a laser field , thus the first segment become primary down - conversion source , and photon pair is created .",
    "one of the photons from this pair drives the secondary down - conversion process in the second segment , generating a second pair , hence , a photon triplet . because the photon triplet originates from a single pump photon",
    ", the created photons are strongly correlated .",
    "the @xmath89 and @xmath90 processes has been implemented in the first and the second sections of the crystal , correspondingly .",
    "we calculate the coupling constants of parametric processes : @xmath66 and @xmath65 as a function of the finite number of nonlinear segments .",
    "below , we consider spectral amplitudes of these cascaded processes assuming the frequencies @xmath44 and @xmath45 as variable quantities distributed around the central values @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "the three - photon amplitude @xmath91 from eq.([fipd ] ) is proportional to the product of the coupling constants and the pump field amplitude : @xmath92 , which is taken in the form of gaussian distribution ( [ eg ] ) .",
    "this lattice is arranged in the manner that each of the fourier functions ( [ zt ] ) , ( [ qsi ] ) is determines by one of the family of the segments .",
    "the details of calculations based on formula ( [ klishkoeq ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "we derive the following expression for @xmath66 in terms of eq.([klishkoeq ] ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 here @xmath95 , @xmath96 are the harmonic grating wave vectors for the first and the second segments , respectively , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the total lengths of first and second sections , correspondingly .",
    "we assume that effective @xmath77 process goes in the first section , so the conditions of the perfect qpm is @xmath101 .",
    "correspondingly , it is easy to see that the second term in ( [ sumzt - hum ] ) could be neglected proceeding from the qpm condition we are required",
    ".    let us write the approximation of ( [ sumzt - hum ] ) for @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "we rewrite qpm condition in the following form @xmath108 , here is asseverated that the constant term could be compensated by the grating wave vector @xmath109 . using this approach and assuming that @xmath110 is very small and",
    "could be neglected we could find that the @xmath111 function in the ( [ sumzt - hum ] ) becomes a constant multiplier equal to @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the final approximated form of the @xmath66 is represented in following form @xmath113 this result is transformed to an expression that usually used for ppnc in the standard treatment .",
    "the fourier function ( [ qsi ] ) is calculated in the following form @xmath114 where @xmath115 thus , we assume that effective @xmath116 process goes in the second section , so the conditions of the perfect qpm is @xmath117 .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case the first term in ( [ xi - hum ] ) could be neglected proceeding from the qpm condition we required .",
    "we could write the approximated form for @xmath65 similar to eq.([apzt - hum ] ) .",
    "so we calculated the coupling constants for the both spdc processes and found the qpm conditions for their perfect implementation .",
    "the both conditions depend on grating wave vectors , consequently , depend on the periods of the segments , which are easily manageable .      in this subsection",
    "we shortly discuss generation of frequency - uncorrelated triplets of photons , in analogy with the cascaded scheme realized experimentally in @xcite .",
    "thus , we assume that photon frequency - uncorrelated pairs in three - wave cascaded process @xmath118 , @xmath1 can be generated .",
    "note , that in typical spdc experiments a monochromatic pump beam is used .",
    "in this situation , the sum of the frequencies of the signal and idler photons is fixed , thus the frequencies of photons are anticorrelated .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed for creating frequency - correlated spdc under short laser pulses @xcite .",
    "this point is discussed in details in sec .",
    "iv for the cascaded scheme . in the frequency - uncorrelated approach",

    "we suppose the initial state of the cascaded system is a vacuum state @xmath131 .",

    "thus , we demonstrate that in this cascaded scheme triple photons can constitute the greenberger - horne - zeilinger states of light .",
    "in this section we investigate an improvement of above approach based on dual - grid nonlinear crystal for engineering controllable , factorable photon states .",
    "we consider multilayered structure of second - order nonlinear and linear materials .",
