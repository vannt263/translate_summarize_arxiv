    "the rapid expansion of research frontiers into the nanometer and femtosecond regime demands a careful consideration of dissipation as a way to counterbalance the energy influx from the external fields in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "the subject takes roots in the seminal work by feynman and vernon @xcite who treated a quantum object coupled to an infinite collection of oscillators as a model of a linear dissipative environment . by employing the path - integral techniques they were able to eliminate the environment variables and arrived at a dissipative modification of the green s function of the quantum object",
    "this approach was further used by a number of authors , most notably by caldeira and leggett @xcite , who applied it to a specific problem of dissipative effects in tunneling on a macroscopic scale . a detailed account on the problem of dissipation in quantum - mechanical systems",
    "can be found in a monograph by weiss @xcite while semiclassical approaches are also reviewed in @xcite .",
    "generally , the main mode of attack uses the density - matrix formalism @xcite and the popular lindblad technique @xcite .",
    "this approach is relevant for _ open _ quantum systems .",
    "in contrast , the considerably less arduous schrdinger - equation formalism is regarded to be appropriate for _ isolated _ systems @xcite that are described by a hermitian hamiltonian .    despite this fact , there were successful attempts to include dissipation directly in the schrdinger equation .",
    "most often they based on the de broglie - bohm picture @xcite and employed modifications to the quantum potential @xcite .",
    "these ideas were used by kostin to derive a dissipative nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite , and albrecht @xcite worked out the general principles limiting the acceptable form of the nonlinear terms .    the problem of dissipation in quantum mechanics is closely connected to the use of mixed quantum - classical treatments @xcite whereby only a few degrees of freedom of a complex system are treated quantum - mechanically while the remaining ones are described classically . although egorov and coworkers @xcite point out that not always an accurate description is attained and so this approach must be used with care , it is recognized as a method of choice when a significant reduction of complexity is desired .    in this paper",
    "we present a derivation of a rather simple nonlinear schrdinger equation that includes a dissipative term .",
    "this equation is obtained from a consideration of a physical model : a quantum oscillator connected to an infinite classical string that acts as a means to transfer energy away from the quantum system ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the obtained schrdinger - like equation is illustrated by considering two specific examples .",
    "the first one , the decay of a quasi - stationary state , is an auxiliary one and shows that the results obtained by using our analysis do not contradict the ones derived by the usual and more complex methods using the density - matrix formalism and a double set of variables .",
    "the second example , the nonlinear resonance , is interesting on its own and demonstrates that the quantum - mechanical nonlinear resonance is physically richer than its classical analog .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in sect .",
    "ii , the model system is introduced and the dissipative schrdinger - like equation for the quantum system is derived . in sect .",
    "iii , the obtained equation is simplified employing the rotating - wave approximation . in the next two sections ,",
    "some illustrations of the developed technique are presented : in sect .",
    "iv we consider the decay of the quasi - stationary state , and sect .",
    "v is devoted to the non - linear resonance .",
    "finally , our conclusions are formulated in sect .  vi .",
    "let us begin by introducing our model of weakly coupled quantum and classical subsystems .",
    "the quantum system is modeled as a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath0 and spring constant @xmath1 , described by the quantum - mechanical position and momentum operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the role of the classical system is played by a semi - infinite classical string which , for the sake of convenience , is discretized and represented as a chain of identical balls of mass @xmath4 interconnected by springs of equilibrium length @xmath5 and spring constant @xmath6 .",
    "the two subsystems are linked by a different spring ( spring constant @xmath7 ) connecting the quantum oscillator to the ball sitting at the end of the chain as depicted in fig .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath8 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 denoting the coordinate of the @xmath10-th ball measured from its equilibrium position , and @xmath11 the respective momentum .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the quantum oscillator is described by its own wave function @xmath12 which solves the schrdinger equation @xmath13 with the above hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) while the dynamical variables of the balls in the chain obey the classical hamilton equations @xmath14 with the hamiltonian operator replaced by its quantum - mechanical average over the state of the quantum oscillator @xmath15 in this way , quantum variables and operators do not enter the equations for the classical degrees of freedom and one obtains a consistent description .",
    "this averaging constitutes the main assumption of the quasiclassical approximation and was used earlier to treat the coupling of classical and quantum degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we give some further justification of this crucial step below .",
    "( [ newton ] ) lead to the standard classical equations for the chain    [ chlg ] @xmath16    the second of these equations ( [ chlg2 ] ) is readily solved by the fourier transform @xmath17 producing the standard dispersion law @xmath18 from here on we restrict our consideration to the long - wavelength approximation ( @xmath19 ) thus neglecting the discretization and effectively returning to a continuous - string model for the classical subsystem . in this limit",
    ", we have a linear dispersion law @xmath20 with the wave - propagation velocity @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    inserting the fourier transform ( [ furjeint ] ) into the boundary condition ( [ chlg1 ] ) and using the long - wavelength approximation we are able to simplify its left - hand side to @xmath23 the resulting equation of motion for the first ball coordinate @xmath24 @xmath25",
    "may be interpreted as the equation of motion for a dissipative classical mode .",
    "( [ ks2 ] ) together with the schrdinger equation ( [ schred ] ) for the quantum variables constitute the complete equation set describing the behavior of the dissipative quantum system .",
    "now we turn to the examination of the validity of the employed quasiclassical approximation . a smooth way to proceed is to introduce the dimensionless variables by means of scaling @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the characteristic length scales of the quantum and classical subsystems , and @xmath29 stands for the frequency of the quantum oscillator . the scaling enables us to rewrite the obtained set of equations as    [ setfin ] @xmath30    with @xmath31 note that we excluded the terms which do not depend on the operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the quantum hamiltonian ( [ setfin2 ] ) as they can always be absorbed into the wave - function phase .",
    "the obtained equations describe the interaction of a quantum - mechanical system with a single dissipative classical mode @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the derivation does not depend on the assumption that the quantum system is a harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus , the equations are general and can be applied to any quantum system with dissipation .",
    "for instance , considering an _ anharmonic _ oscillator driven by an external time - periodic force ( we treat this case as an illustration ) the above hamiltonian is supplemented with the following additional terms @xmath32 with @xmath33 expressing the force amplitude and @xmath34 being the anharmonicity coefficient .    in order to have an appreciable ( that is , not negligibly small ) interaction between the quantum and classical subsystems",
    "one has to assume the characteristic frequencies @xmath29 and @xmath35 to be of the same order of magnitude . under this assumption",
    "the quantum oscillator will be able to emit `` phonons '' into the string .",
    "furthermore , the coupling constant @xmath7 representing the interaction of quantum oscillator with the chain should not exceed the constant @xmath1 describing the oscillator potential itself .",
    "otherwise , the oscillator can not be considered as a separate entity . in view of the above constraints , the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 depend essentially only on the adiabatic parameter @xmath38 .",
    "thus , in the case of a light quantum oscillator interacting with a chain of heavy balls the above adiabatic parameter is small and so are the coupling constants .",
    "the smallness of the coupling constant ensures a weak perturbation of the chain .",
    "the chain under consideration may be treated as a collection of noninteracting harmonic modes .",
    "meanwhile , the quantum - mechanical description of a harmonic mode gives the same result as the classical one .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that the smallness of the adiabatic parameter @xmath38 guarantees the validity of the applied quasiclassical approximation for the description of the interaction between the quantum and classical subsystems .",
    "a similar argument was also presented in the development of the mixed quantum - classical dynamics @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may argue that due the smallness of the adiabatic parameter the characteristic length of the wave functions of heavy balls @xmath28 is much smaller than the characteristic length @xmath27 of the wave function of the oscillator .",
    "consequently , the balls may be considered to be following their well - defined classical trajectories whereas the oscillator has to be described quantum - mechanically .",
    "let us now proceed to some illustrations of the developed formalism based on a weakly nonlinear oscillator .",
    "namely , we assume that the hamiltonian of the quantum subsystem consists of a sum of eq .",
    "( [ setfin2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ hamadd ] ) .",
    "besides , we restrict the treatment to the case of a weak nonlinearity , that is , we assume that the anharmonicity @xmath34 , the force amplitude @xmath33 , and the coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 are small quantities compared to the unity . we also restrict the frequency of the driving field to the immediate vicinity of the resonant frequency of the harmonic oscillator which is unity in the dimensionless units .",
    "thus we are able to treat the frequency deviation from the resonance as yet another small parameter @xmath39 .",
    "we expand the sought wave function into the series of harmonic - oscillator eigenfunctions @xmath40 here , the dimensionless energies and the corresponding eigenfunctions read @xmath41 and the symbol @xmath42 stands for the @xmath10-th hermite polynomial . note that instead of the usual time dependence @xmath43 of a harmonic - oscillator eigenfunction eq .",
    "( [ series ] ) features a slightly modified exponential factor @xmath44 that absorbs a part of the time dependence of the expansion coefficient @xmath45 .    using the above expansion of the wave function ( [ series ] )",
    "the coordinate average can be presented as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the usual polarization of the quantum oscillator .    inserting the coordinate average ( [ aver ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ setfin3 ] ) , and solving it to the leading term in the small coupling constants we obtain the following expression for the coordinate of the first ball @xmath48 next , inserting the obtained expression ( [ fbex ] ) and the wave function ( [ series ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ setfin1 ] ) , projecting this equation onto the @xmath10-th state , and neglecting all oscillating terms ( this amounts to the usual rotating - wave approximation ) we arrive at the final set of equations for the time evolution of the wave function expansion coefficients @xmath49 here , for the sake of simpler notation we denoted @xmath50 the obtained set of equations ( [ fsa ] ) was solved in the two- and three - level approximations , and the results are presented in the following sections .",
    "in order to illustrate the validity of the proposed method we consider a well - known problem of the decay of a quasi - stationary state .    for this purpose , we assume that the quantum system has only two states and there is no anharmonicity and no external force ( @xmath51 ) . at the beginning",
    "the system is prepared in the upper level , that is , the boundary condition reads @xmath52    according to eq .",
    "( [ fsa ] ) , the behavior of this simple system is described by the following two equations @xmath53 these equations are readily solved analytically , and the solution reads @xmath54 these filling factors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by the thick solid ( excited level ) and dashed ( ground level ) lines .      thick solid curve , @xmath55  dashed curve , @xmath5  dotted curve , and @xmath24  thin solid curve.,width=302 ]    we see that the quantum transition takes place during a finite period of time proportional to @xmath56 , the reciprocal friction coefficient .",
    "the dotted curve shows the oscillator polarization @xmath57 induced during the quantum transition , and the thin solid line shows the classical coordinate of first ball in the chain @xmath58 which is calculated by means of expression ( [ fbex ] ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", this curve represents the coordinate of _ any _ ball in the chain because according to eq .",
    "( [ furjeint ] ) the coordinate of the @xmath10-th ball can be expressed as @xmath59 therefore , during the decay of the quantum state a string excitation of the shape shown by thin solid line is emitted and travels away from the quantum oscillator with a constant velocity @xmath60 .",
    "it can be interpreted as the classical analog of an emitted phonon . naturally , the total energy carried by the string excitation is equal to the energy difference between the two quantum levels .",
    "consequently , we may conclude that the quantum subsystem provides the energy quantization in the classical one .",
    "it is worth mentioning that taking into account the norm conservation ( @xmath61 ) eqs .",
    "( [ fsa ] ) can be transformed into another set of equations governing the behavior of three real variables : the inversion @xmath62 and the ( complex ) polarization @xmath5 .",
    "the linearized version of these equations in the vicinity of the stationary state @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) reads @xmath65 it is remarkable that these equations coincide with those considered in the density matrix formalism @xcite , moreover , from our eq .",
    "( [ dmlin ] ) we are able to extract the relaxation times : the longitudinal relaxation time is @xmath66 and the perpendicular one is @xmath67 .",
    "we see that these relaxation times obey the relation @xmath68 inherent to the pure state when no ensemble average is carried out and this fact confirms the adequacy of our attempt to describe a dissipative quantum system in the schrdinger - equation formalism .",
    "two more comments are in order .",
    "first , according to eqs .",
    "( [ twop ] ) we used the boundary condition at @xmath69 .",
    "this is related to the classical description of the chain excitations when there is no spontaneous emission . when solving the equations numerically one has to add some initial vibration field fluctuation in order to force the quantum transition .",
    "another point is related to the fourier transform of the coordinate of the first ball @xmath70 which gives us the shape of the emission line .",
    "we see that close to the resonant frequency , when @xmath71 , the line shape is lorentzian coinciding with the result following from a simple calculation based on the fermi s golden rule .",
    "however , further away from the resonance , the line shape deviates from the lorentzian and features exponential tails .",
    "the following problem is that of the resonant power absorbtion which we calculated solving the equation set ( [ fsa ] ) using two - level    [ reztwo ] @xmath72    and three - level    [ rezthree ] @xmath73    approximations . note that we excluded a nonlinear term from the equations of the two - level approximation because in this case it leads only to an inessential shift of the resonant frequency .",
    "the power absorption was calculated by averaging the instantaneous power over the period of the external force , that is , @xmath74 the power absorption in the two - level approximation as a function of the deviation @xmath75 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for various force amplitudes .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ reztwo ] ) and ( [ rezthree ] ) depend linearly on their parameters , therefore , by using an appropriate scaling of the time we may reduce the number of parameters by one .",
    "therefore , we choose to express the quantities @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath75 and @xmath34 in @xmath78 units .",
    "we observe the following typical behavior : for a weak force ( @xmath79 ) the shape of the resonance resembles a lorentzian , and its peak value is increasing with increasing force .",
    "when the force exceeds the critical value @xmath80 the peak stops growing and is flattened at the top due to the saturation at the critical power absorption value @xmath81 indicated by the thin dotted line .",
    ".,width=302 ]    in the next two figures the results for power absorption calculated in the three - level approximation are shown . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the power absorption in a linear oscillator ( @xmath82 ) .",
    ".,width=302 ]    the general shape of the absorption curves closely resembles those obtained in the two - level approximation , except that now the saturation sets in at a larger force value @xmath83 , and the saturated power absorption @xmath84 is larger as well .",
    "a more essential difference is seen in the uppermost curve corresponding to the force whose amplitude ( @xmath85 ) strongly exceeds the critical value . here",
    "we see a narrow gap in the absorption which appears close to the resonant frequency .",
    "it resembles an analogous gap that appears in the power absorption calculated by means of the density matrix equation technique @xcite and is caused by the interaction of coherent light with an inhomogeneously broadened resonance line .    .",
    "the curves are numbered by the values of the anharmonicity coefficient @xmath86.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the results for the nonlinear oscillator are presented for a set of values of the anharmonicity coefficient and the force amplitude corresponding to the critical value of the two - level approximation , i.  e.  @xmath87 .",
    "we see that for the linear - oscillator case ( @xmath82 ) the absorption demonstrates the expected lorentzian behavior .",
    "when the anharmonicity is incremented the resonant peak moves to the right , becomes asymmetric and the saturation manifests itself as a widening absorption gap close to the shifted resonance frequency .",
    "the absorption gap resembles the gap in nonlinear cyclotron resonance @xcite which was described using the balance equations . in that work",
    "the gap was related to the dynamical chaos appearing in the _ classical _ nonlinear equations of motion .",
    "quantum chaos is a subject of great interest as well ( see @xcite for references ) , and is largely concerned with the quantum signatures of classically chaotic systems .",
    "such signatures are often sought by comparing the wave - function patterns corresponding to various eigenstates with the classical trajectories @xcite .",
    "it follows from our quasiclassical consideration , eqs .",
    "( [ fsa ] ) , that the behavior of the quantum system can also be visualized and interpreted in terms of phase - space trajectories obtained by treating the wave function expansion coefficients @xmath88 as generalized coordinates . in order to illustrate this possibility",
    ", we looked at the behavior of the quantum anharmonic oscillator in the absorption gap more carefully . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the right - hand side of this absorption gap for the parameter values @xmath87 and @xmath89 is shown in more detail .",
    "the simplest way to distinguish various types of dynamic behavior is to plot the phase portrait of the system . as there are three complex variables constrained by a single normalization condition the phase space is five - dimensional .     and",
    "@xmath89.,width=302 ]    therefore , we restrict ourselves to a projection of the phase space onto a two - dimensional plane @xmath90 shown in fig .",
    "the panel numbers correspond to the frequencies indicated by dots in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    ".,width=302 ]    we see that on the regular flank of the resonance curve ( point 1 ) the oscillator demonstrates a rather simple behavior  the limit cycle . as a matter of fact , in this case all three coefficients @xmath88 oscillate with the same frequency , namely , @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , in this case the power absorption problem can be simplified essentially and transformed into a nonlinear eigenvalue problem defining the frequency @xmath92 , and the stationary coefficients @xmath93 are simply related to the filling factors of the harmonic oscillator levels .",
    "the behavior of the anharmonic oscillator in the absorption gap ( points 2 , 3 , 4 ) is quite different . here ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath88 oscillate with multiple frequencies , moreover , the oscillator can demonstrate both periodic behavior ( point 2 ) and non - periodic behavior ( points 3 , 4 ) .",
    "this non - periodicity is in fact responsible for the gap in the power absorption as it causes the loss of coherence between the driving force and the system response .",
    "this is the so - called quasiperiodic behavior but the appearance of a strange attractor is also expectable at larger values of the anharmonicity coefficient @xmath34 .",
    "in conclusion , we propose a schrdinger - like equation for the description of a dissipative quantum - mechanical system . this equation is derived on the basis of a quasiclassical treatment of coupled quantum and classical subsystems and justified by the difference of masses of the two subsystems which leads to the smallness of adiabatic parameters .",
    "the considered decay of a quasi - stationary state demonstrates that the proposed description gives identical results to those obtained from the density - matrix approach when only homogeneous broadening is taken into account .",
    "the model calculation of the nonlinear absorption indicates that many classical phenomena  such as the asymmetry of the resonance shape and absorption dips  brought about by the loss of coherence between the driving force and the response may be featured by a quantum system as well .",
    "we believe that the proposed schrdinger - equation formalism with dissipation may find application to quantum nanostructures and quantum chaos .",
