    "non - thermal plasma is one of the main components of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "it mostly contains relativistic electrons and protons , which permeate the ism and interact with the all - pervasive magnetic field of our galaxy @xcite , resulting in synchrotron emission . at low radio frequencies , like those measured by the lofar telescope @xcite , the line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field component ( @xmath1 ) and ionized gas can be probed by changes in the polarization of the galactic synchrotron radiation through the so - called faraday rotation .",
    "recent wsrt and lofar observations @xcite have shown surprisingsly strong polarization at frequencies around 150mhz .",
    "this polarization originates in the diffuse galactic background . due to faraday rotation in the medium between source and observer the frequency dependence of the polarization",

    "the frequency - dependent polarization can be unravelled using a technique called rotation measure ( rm ) synthesis @xcite ; this produces images as a function of rm or faraday depth .",

    "polarization results from the alignment of interstellar dust grains with respect to the galactic magnetic field @xcite . hence",
    ", dust polarized emission provides powerful insights into the physical properties of the dust and the magnetic field .",
    "the physical quantities that the two probes measure are in general thought to be unrelated . whereas faraday rotation at low frequencies is sensitive to localized structures in faraday space , which in the 3c196 field mostly have small faraday depth , the _ planck _ dust polarization gives the density weighted mean orientation of the magnetic field component perpendicular to the los , @xmath4 . indeed , in a number of lofar observational windows , e.g.",
    ", elais - n1 and ncp @xcite , no correlation between the two probes is evident .",

    "it has been observed on a large number of nights with the lofar high band antennas ( hba ) . for this paper",
    "we use images based on one fully processed 8h synthesis , taken in december 2012 . a detailed description of the data , their processing and the image quality obtained from them are found in @xcite .",
    "for completeness , we present here a brief overview of the data .",
    "the dataset contains all four correlation products between pairs of orthogonal lofar dipoles from which full stokes ( iquv ) images were made in the frequency range of @xmath0 with @xmath7 resolution .",
    "the images were produced with a frequency independent resolution of about 3 arcminutes . on these images",
    "we apply rm synthesis @xcite to study the linearly polarized emission as a function of faraday depth .",
    "faraday depth gives the amount of faraday rotation due to the intervening magneto - ionic medium between the source of the polarized emission and the observer , @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the electron number density in @xmath10 , @xmath11 is measured in @xmath12 g , and @xmath13 is the los element in pc .",
    "the spectral resolution and frequency range of the data constrain the resolution of our cubes in faraday depth to @xmath14 and the largest faraday structure that can be detected @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "a `` triangular '' feature displayed in green ( marked with c ) is emission at negative faraday depths ( @xmath16 to @xmath20 ) , the filamentary structures at faraday depth of @xmath21 are given in yellow ( marked with a and b ) .",

    "the _ planck _ satellite has measured the sky in 9 frequencies ranging from @xmath26ghz to @xmath27ghz . an inspection of these maps reveals that the lowest frequencies ( @xmath26ghz and @xmath28ghz ) and the highest frequencies ( @xmath29ghz ) are dominated by galactic synchrotron emission and thermal dust emission , respectively @xcite .",

    "satellite team used the polarized data at @xmath30ghz to construct an all - sky map of the galactic magnetic field orientation projected onto the plane of the sky @xcite .",

    "coherent polarized emission is observed because the elongated dust grains tend to be aligned , along their short axes , with respect to the magnetic field .",

    "there are three regions of interest , marked as * a * , * b * and * c * in fig .  [ fig : filaments ] . the strength of the correlation between the two probes is discussed separately for each region . in general , there is a broad alignment between the south to north orientation of the magnetic field lines as measured by _ planck _ with the orientation of the lofar filaments detected in faraday depth .",

    "this alignment is not only with the feature at this specific faraday depth in the lofar data but also with many other features associated with this filament , such as the depolarization canals described in @xcite .",
    "this correlation might not be surprising since the overall galactic magnetic field direction , is aligned with the south - north direction in this specific projection .",
    "however , we note that such a correlation is not seen in the other lofar observational windows , at comparable galactic latitudes like the elais - n1 @xcite and ncp ( jeli et al . in prep . )",
    "fields .",
    "the second correlated feature is shown in the region * b*. here the bending of the magnetic field line follows that of the filament at the faraday depth of @xmath21 .",
    "the correlation of this feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : filaments ] , though obvious , requires a more careful statistical analysis to assess its significance . in order to quantify this we resort to the rm cubes .",
    "we use stokes q images that contain information about both intensity and polarization angle and therefore exhibit larger contrast , which helps defining the features at faraday depth of @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qlines ] ) .",
    "the area deliniated with a black contour is the region in which the polarization angle is roughly constant ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "magnetic field lines are overlaid and indicated with the yellow contours . the filled line in green marks the _ planck _ magnetic field line that has a shape similar to the lofar feature .     and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the red curve in the figure shows the squared difference between the angles of the most similar lines in figure  [ fig : qlines ] ( red and green lines ) , whereas the rest shows the angle difference squared between the yellow line and five randomly chosen _",

    "the two vertical dashed lines mark the range over which the red line is the smallest ; namely @xmath34 for about @xmath35 ) . ]    in order to define these features both are fitted with order 10 polynomials , resulting in the red line for the lofar data shown in the figure .",
    "the angle , @xmath36 , of the tangent at each point along the curve is calculated for both lofar ( red ) and _ planck _ ( green ) lines and compared using a normalized @xmath37-squared statistic . for two lines , or part of them , to be similar the angles defining their direction should be close over a long stretch of their path .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff ] shows the square of the difference between these angles , which we call @xmath38 and @xmath33 for lofar and _ planck _ , respectively .",
    "the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] corresponds to the squared angle difference between the most similar lines in fig .",

    "fig : qlines ] . clearly , the red curve shows the smallest difference for the longest stretch of length along the two curves .",
    "the two vertical dashed lines indicate the range over which the squared angle difference is the smallest ( @xmath34 for about @xmath35 ) .",
    "therefore , we define our statistic to be @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of adjacent pixels around the pixel with the minimum angle difference ; @xmath41 is the angle of the lofar curve tangent at pixel @xmath42 and @xmath43 is that of _",
    "planck_. @xmath40 is chosen to be 150 pixels which corresponds to @xmath35 , defined by the two dashed lines in figure  [ fig : diff ] .",
    "we note that since the two curves have in general different lengths , the comparison is carried out within the overlap region . in case",
    "this overlap covers less than 150 pixels , we choose @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of pixels in the overlapping region .    to address how unusually similar these two curves are , all the _ planck _ magnetic field lines apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : qlines ] ( about 40 ) are compared to the lofar structure of region * b * using the statistic defined in equation  [ eq : chi2 ] . to obtain more random realizations of the magnetic field lines that retain their statistical and physical properties we randomly shift the _",
    "field lines along the declination , and if needed , we wrap them across the declination boundaries .",
    "this results in about 1000 comparisons .",
    "the probability density function of this statistic is shown in figure  [ fig : histogram ] with logarithmic bins .",
    "the left side of the histogram is fitted with a gaussian ( the solid smooth line ) . as expected the pdf is asymmetric around its peak , however , we note that the existence of a clear sharp peak is due to the special nature of the 3c196 field in which most features are along the south - north direction .",
    "the red vertical line in this figure shows the result of the @xmath46 statistic for the most similar lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : qlines ] ( red and green lines ) .",
    "this clearly shows that the similarity between these two lines is statistically significant and unlikely due to statistical coincidence . notice that this statistic does not take into account the location of each curve , but",
    "rather compares only their shape .",
    "therefore , the fact that these two curves are unusually similar and are co - located on the sky makes the statistical significance of this correlation even larger .",
    "we note that this result was confirmed by similar analysis based directly on the _ planck _ q and u maps , independently of the lic algorithm .     with logarithmic bins .",
    "the left side of the histogram is fitted with a gaussian ( the solid line ) .",
    "this is in practice a log - normal distribution .",
    "the gaussian is centered at -1.38 and its width is @xmath47 .",
    "the red vertical line shows the value of the @xmath46 statistic comparing the most similar lines in figure  [ fig : qlines ] ( red and green line ) . ]    the third region that shows correlated features is region * c * in figure  [ fig : filaments ] . around this region",
    "the _ planck _",
    "magnetic field lines broadly follow the bend in the red line as indicated by the arrow in figure  [ fig : qlines ] . moreover",
    ", the magnetic field lines from _ planck _ seem to be less coherent within this region .",
    "we have deconvolved the magnetic field into rotational ( curl ) and potential ( divergence ) components , assuming the third direction to be the los direction .",
    "this analysis shows that the magnetic field within region * c * have a dominant rotational component .",
    "this component can not be due to turbulence simply because region * c * has a coherent faraday displacement .",
    "the last two statements are hard to quantify statistically , hence they should be viewed merely as potentially interesting observations .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the morphology and significance of the correlated features between the lofar and _ planck _ data sets in the 3c196 field .",
    "the lofar polarization data in faraday depth is proportional to @xmath48 ( eq .  [ eq : faraday ] ) , whereas _",
    "planck _ measures , through the polarized dust emission , @xmath4 . since dust and electron distributions are probably unrelated and the magnetic field components that these probes measure are different",
    ", one does not generally expect the two data sets to be correlated . indeed , in a number of common observational fields",
    ", we confirm that such a correlation is not evident .",
    "the correlation features reported in this paper point to a common underlying physical structure that influences both the lofar and _ planck _ data sets .",
    "one can roughly divide the features into global and local features .",
    "the global feature is the broad correlation of the dust inferred orientation of the magnetic field and the lofar filaments , clearly apparent in the images .",
    "this is especially striking when one inspects features * a * and * b * in figure  [ fig : filaments ] .",
    "@xcite make the point that since in the 3c196 field the magnetic field that follows the spiral arm of our galaxy is almost perpendicular to the los , @xmath11 is small relative to @xmath49 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the estimated @xmath50 in the direction of the pulsar j081558 + 461155 , located about 2@xmath51 south of 3c196 , using the rm to dispersion measure ratio ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a low @xmath1 suggests that the origin of the correlation resides in the alignment of the electron density distribution with @xmath4 .",
    "such alignment has been observed for the filamentary structures traced by dust emission @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the broad alignment between the two images might be driven by the global magnetic field of the galaxy , which is typically @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this interpretation , although the most straightforward for us , does not preclude other explanations that rely on variations in the structure of @xmath1 .",
    "the correlations implied by the local features are apparent in regions * b * and * c*. the agreement between the bending of the lines in both regions , especially in * b * , argues that the two effects come from the same physical location .",
    "the physical properties of the ism in this region are uncertain .",
    "however , some constraints can be derived from the lofar observations @xcite .",
    "the lack of observed emission in the lofar total intensity , associated with the filamentary structures detected in polarization , gives an upper limit to their thermal free - free emission , @xmath53k .",
    "if we adopt @xmath54 for the electron temperature @xcite , which is a typical value for the warm ionized ism , and @xmath55 for the los thickness @xcite , we find @xmath56 .",
    "the thickness of the structures in faraday depth , @xmath57 , constrains @xmath58 , assuming again @xmath55 .",
    "motivated by the agreement in the bending of region * b * , we consider equipartition between magnetic energy and thermal energy .",
    "using these constraints on @xmath9 , we find that the strength of the total magnetic field has to be @xmath59 .",
    "note that in reality these values might be different as equipartition might not hold between the magentic energy and thermal energy but rather between the magnetic and kinetic energy associated with bulk motions .",
    "we also note that the true values of @xmath1 and @xmath60 are probably close to the limits derived above , because obviously @xmath61 , moreover the detection of polarized dust emission by _ planck",
    "_ requires a significant @xmath4 .",
    "this is also consistent with the analysis of the lofar data in this field as noted by @xcite .    to resolve the ambiguity of the physical parameters and shed light on the physical picture of the ism ,",
    "additional observational probes are needed . here",
    "we mention a few .",
    "* dust particles are usually embedded within neutral hydrogen ( hi ) gas .",
    "this is especially evident through hi / dust correlation at high galactic latitudes , where the sky is largely transparent to hi emission and infrared emission from dust .",
    "therefore , hi data can provide kinematic information about the features studied in this paper .",
    "* observed starlight polarization , caused by selective absorption by magnetically aligned interstellar dust grains along the los , traces the orientation of @xmath4 @xcite . by repeating this measurement for stars at different distances , one can map the the 3d distribution of the orientation of @xmath4 and provide complementary information to _",
    "s dust polarization observations . however , this type of polarimetry is sensitive only to the orientation of the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "it is worth noting that a 3d mapping of the galactic magnetic field might be crucial for the removal of dust polarisation foreground in order to measure the primordial cmb b - mode polarisation signal ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* to determine the strength of the interstellar magnetic field , one can attempt to measure the zeeman splitting of the hi 21-cm line or other radio lines .",
    "such data measure the @xmath1 component of interstellar magnetic field and complement observations of the faraday depth structure . * future limits on the fine structure in total intensity of the diffuse emission will allows us to constrain @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the correlation between these two probes calls for exploration of a similar correlation in other fields .",
    "specifically , we propose to explore regions in which the _ planck _ derived magnetic field is coherent and ordered over a large region of the sky and follow such regions with lofar observations .",
    "this comparison might shed more light on the physical origin of this correlation .",
