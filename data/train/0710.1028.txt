    "the extensively studied galaxy m82 is a local example of a nuclear starburst galaxy .",
    "* hereafter om78 ) first catalogued the complex star - forming regions seen in ground - based images of the m82 disk , and introduced the nomenclature a  h . region  b is the brightest region in the disk and is located 3501050pc north - east of the nucleus .",
    "om78 and @xcite find that the integrated spectrum of this region is indicative of a fossil starburst region as it shows the characteristic ` e@xmath2a ' post - starburst spectrum , suggestive of a truncated burst of star formation occurring 1001000myr ago .",
    "moreover , they find that the intrinsic brightness of region  b is such that the burst must have been of comparable intensity to the present starburst in the nucleus",
    ".    more recently , de grijs , oconnell , & gallagher ( 2001 ) studied the m82-b cluster population using photometry obtained with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "they identified 113 clusters and , by estimating ages and extinctions from @xmath3 photometry , they found that a concentrated episode of cluster formation occurred 4001000myr ago with a peak at 600myr .",
    "subsequent to this analysis , de grijs , bastian , &  lamers  ( 2003a ) re - derived ages and extinctions by combining @xmath3 and @xmath4 photometry ; they find that the peak of cluster formation occurred at 1.10gyr with an age spread of 5001500myr .",
    "de grijs , bastian , &  lamers  ( 2003b ) used these new ages to derive the cluster luminosity function ( clf ) for a fiducial age of 1.0gyr and find that it has a gaussian shape , similar to globular clusters ( gcs ) , rather than the standard power - law clf found for populations of young massive clusters ( ymcs ) ( e. g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result is surprising but supports theoretical models advocating that an initial power - law distribution of cluster masses will be transformed into a gaussian distribution because low mass clusters will be preferentially disrupted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite therefore suggest that because m82-b is of intermediate age , it provides the ` missing evolutionary link ' between the power - law clfs found for ymcs and the gaussian clfs of globular clusters .",
    "however , for an environment as turbulent as that of m82 , one would expect a timescale of several gyr for preferential disruption to produce this effect ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* where such a timescale is calculated for ngc 1316 and ngc 3610 respectively ) .    to date",
    ", spectroscopy of the region  b cluster population has been extremely limited ; the only published spectra are those of @xcite for the two brightest members .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and , although they are of low quality , the derived ages of 350@xmath5100myr are much lower than the photometrically - based ages of @xmath10.76  gyr @xcite for the same clusters .",
    "this discrepancy hints at the possibility that region  b may be younger and that the ages derived from the photometry are too high .",
    "it is important to determine accurate ages for the m82-b cluster population to verify its unusual clf , and for understanding the cluster formation history of m82 and its relationship to encounters with its close neighbour m81 .",
    "we therefore acquired new spectroscopic and photometric data for the m82-b cluster population . by using both techniques we are able to obtain information for a large number of clusters and",
    "also overcome the degeneracy between age and extinction that presents a hurdle in the analysis of photometric data @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we present optical spectroscopy for seven clusters obtained with the gillett gemini telescope , and in a companion paper @xcite , we present new hst imaging , including @xmath6-band photometry of the clusters .",
    "the spectroscopic data presented in this paper were obtained with the gillett gemini north 8.1-metre telescope using the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos - n ) , as part of program gn-2006a - q-38 ( pi smith ) .",
    "the target selection was made based on photometric criteria with the potential ymcs identified on gmos pre - imaging , taken as part of the observing program .",
    "a multi - slit mask was designed , using a slit width of 0@xmath775 , with a variable slit length that we tried to keep to a minimum of 6@xmath75 , in order to include an area of sky that would ensure a good background subtraction .",
    "in some cases however , a smaller slit length was used so as to include a greater number of sources on the mask , resulting in a total of 39 objects being targeted across the m82 galactic disk . in this paper",
    "we focus on seven of these 39 clusters that are situated within region b. fig .",

    "[ spectra ] .",
    "a list of cluster identifiers and coordinates can be found in table  [ tab - radec ] .",
    "the data were acquired on the night of 2006 april 5 , under good seeing conditions ( 0@xmath78 at 5000 ) .",
    "we used the b600 grating and the data were read - out in 2@xmath82 binning mode , resulting in a dispersion of 0.9 .",
    "as this is multi - object spectroscopy , the central wavelength varies slightly with every slit , so the resulting spectral range of the data is approximately  3700 - 6500 .",
    "while we used all three gmos - n ccds to achieve this broad range , the sensitivity of the silver - mirrored chips is lower at the blue end , resulting in a poor s / n and loss of accuracy in the wavelength calibration below 4000 , thus setting a lower limit to our effective wavelength range .",
    "the data were acquired in eight 1800 second exposures , totalling four hours of integration time .",
    "more specifically , there were two sets of four exposures that differed in terms of central wavelength .",
    "this is standard gmos procedure which allows the observer to compensate for the inter - chip gaps through co - adding / merging the spectra ; the two @xmath9 were 5080 and 5120 .",
    "cuar ( copper - argon ) arc exposures and quartz - halogen flat fields were taken in between target exposures .",
    "bias frames were taken as part of the gemini base - line calibrations ( gcal ) .",
    "the data were subsequently reduced using mainly standard iraf reduction tools , as well as tasks from the purpose - developed gemini - iraf package ( v1.9.0 ) .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and then combined into a single image , while correcting for discrepancies in quantum efficiency between the three detectors using the qe gemini iraf tool .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed using the obtained cuar arc frames , resulting in residuals typically less than 0.15 .",
    "one complication that arises when observing in multi - slit mode without an active atmospheric diffraction correction device is differential refraction ; this causes wavelength dependent slit - losses , as it is not possible to keep the slits aligned with the parallactic angle for the duration of an exposure . to alleviate this effect , the combined data were corrected for parallactic angle using a purpose - built idl ( interactive data language ) routine written by b.  w.  miller  ( 2006 , priv .",
    "comm . ) , based on @xcite , where the effects of atmospheric differential refraction are discussed .    at this point",
    "we extracted all 39 spectra from each multi - dimensional mos frame and merged all available exposures of each target . in most cases we decided not to use all available spectra , as some exposures were of poor quality ( caused by seeing degradation ) and thus lowered the quality of the merged spectrum .    finally , the spectra were flux - calibrated using a response function derived from the standard star wolf 1346 .",
    "it should be noted here that the observations used were taken on a different night ( 2006 may 25 ) , due to problems that arose with the exposure of the original flux standard , feige 34 .",
    "this unfortunately led to an increased uncertainty in the absolute flux scale .",
    "having completed the extraction procedure , we measured the width of the sky - line at @xmath105577 , in order to measure the spectral resolution of our data , which we found to be 3.5  ( fwhm ) .",
    "we also tested the wavelength calibration by measuring the exact position of this line and found it to be well within the predicted errors .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of the spectra were determined using two continuum windows between 4400 - 4800  and 5000 - 5800 .",

    "most of the clusters we find emission superposed on the absorption line .",
    "this emission presumably comes from diffuse ionised gas in the region and is not centred at the same wavelength as the absorption , which means that it is not directly associated with the clusters .",
    "the main obstacle that arises when using automated statistical methods is the age degeneracy of balmer line strength , i.e. multiple models of very different ages have similar line strengths .",
    "this means that the ages can not be determined by simply finding the model that best predicts the depth of the line .",
    "in addition to the age degeneracy , the observed spectra may also feature superposed emission , so the fit would not in such cases reflect the actual absorption line profile .",
    "the first method employed ( msrm ) fits a model and calculates the minimised absolute value of the model - spectrum residual .",
    "the best fit is then chosen as the model with the lowest mean residual .",
    "the second method ( ccm ) uses all available data - points to calculate the @xmath30 cumulatively for each model fit .",
    "this offers a more realistic interpretation of a good fit to the entire line profile . in that way",
    ", the best - fitting template will be the one that traces the balmer line profile , including the wings , thus overcoming the observed line strength degeneracy .",
    "as mentioned above , most of the clusters contain emission features within the balmer absorption lines .",

    "[ chi2 ] , where the top panel shows the h@xmath50 line for cluster # 97 ( black solid line ) and the two dashed boxes show where the fit was carried out .",
    "we would like to note here that including the profile centre in the fit causes degradation of the fit quality , however it leaves the cluster age distribution largely unaffected , with ages shifting by an average of @xmath120  myr towards younger values .",

    "the first method employed was the fxcor cross - correlating routine in iraf , which we applied to various regions of the spectrum , each time including a different set of absorption lines .",

    ". the location and physical characteristics of this extinction patch are consistent with the observed shape of the cluster in the @xmath6-band . for cluster # 91",

    "in contrast , we find a larger range in extinctions and a variable overall extinction along this line of sight and hence on average lower compared to other regions of the galaxy disk .",
    "the selection effect created by extended areas of variable extinction reaching low values may explain why region b was thought to occupy a special place within m82 , as it allows for the observation of a far larger number of clusters in visible light bands .",
    "a high number of clusters could be interpreted as the result of a higher cluster formation rate in the region .",
    "the interpretation offered in this paper is that these ` holes ' in the dust distribution of the galaxy are in fact the source of the discrepancy in appearance between its western and eastern sides .",
    "this claim is supported by nicmos near ir observations of the galaxy @xcite , where the two sides seem to have comparable luminosity and to host a similar number of clusters , indicating a shared cluster formation history .",
    "we find that the spectroscopic ages of the seven clusters we have analysed in region b are between 80 and 200myr .",
    "comparison of the photometric and spectroscopic ages for the five clusters in common show that overall , the preferred spectroscopic ages are towards the younger part of the allowed photometric age range .",
    "a good example of this is cluster # 126 which has a photometric age range of 200780myr ( fig .",

    "the ages that we find for the clusters agree well with the time - scale of the last encounter between m82 and m81 , based on a value of 220myr ( yun 1999 ) .",

    "it has been suggested by @xcite that region  b is a gravitationally bound structure . in order to explain how such a large structure could form and survive despite the effects of differential rotation",

    "it is well known that a ring or torus does indeed exist around the m82 bar , but we note that if the torus were to include region b , it would have to have a width of @xmath1500pc , in clear disagreement with the observations ( @xmath6286pc from the centre according to * ? ? ?",

    "clusters # 97 and 103 exhibit stellar and gas kinematics that are consistent with the galaxy rotation curve traced by the ca  t velocities , and the similarity between the cluster and nai  measurements shows that the interstellar gas is located near the clusters .",
    "the radial velocities of clusters # 108 and 126 are consistent with the ca  t absorption line measurements and show that they are located within the main stellar disk of m82 . however , the corresponding nai  velocities are near to the systemic value , indicating that a large column of cool is gas is located in front of these clusters , on the outskirts of the disk .",
    "the radial velocities of clusters # 91 , 113 and 131 are consistent with them being located on the far- or near - side of the disk .",
    "the fact that the nai  is lines are close to systemic argues , however , that these three clusters must be on the near - side of the disk otherwise we would expect the nai  velocity to be offset because of the greater path length .    we thus find no indication that our sample of clusters has unusual kinematics ; instead the large range in radial velocities is consistent with them being located at different depths within the m82 disk .",
    "this also explains the large variation in extinction that we measure .",
    "our findings allow us to test the hypothesis that region b is bound . in order for this to be true",

    "the galactocentric distances of these seven clusters places them on the gently rising part of the rotation curve . assuming a constant rotational velocity @xmath64120  ( fig .",

    "this would imply that clusters in the outermost regions should have a radial velocity , @xmath65 , three times that of the ones in the innermost regions .",
    "this is clearly not the case ; we find no correlation between the cluster radial velocities and their spatial positions as they seem to scatter about the 120  mark , and conclude that the clusters are on regular orbits with respect to the stellar component of the disk .     and",

    "this supported their hypothesis that region b is bound , since a normal power law function would imply unphysically high initial densities .",
    "@xcite suggest that the turn - over in the cluster luminosity and mass functions is not real but is caused by the neglect of the effect of extended sources on the detection limit .",
    "this , in addition to the younger ages that we find , suggests that the disruption timescale derived in @xcite and used in @xcite is probably too short . by not imposing a short disruption timescale to such a young cluster population ,",
    "the idea of an initial power - law distribution is consistent with the data .",
    "we have presented gemini gmos spectroscopy and acs _ ubvi _ photometry for seven clusters in region  b of the starbust galaxy m82 .",
    "our aims were to obtain accurate ages , extinctions and radial velocities for the clusters .",
    "we have used both photometric and spectroscopic methods to determine cluster ages .",
    "our main age determination method is fitting the balmer spectral lines with all available models and finding the best fit ( i.e. the lowest @xmath30 on the overall line profile fit ) , in order to eliminate the known balmer line strength degeneracy .",
    "we find our method to agree with photometric ages derived using the 3def method ( based on @xmath15 colours ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the photometrically - derived ages are accurate but they are not as precise as the ones obtained from spectroscopy and confirms that the only truly independently reliable method for age - dating clusters in extragalactic environments is spectroscopy",
    ". the inclusion of @xmath6-band photometry may enhance the accuracy of photometric measurements , but unless they can be cross - checked by spectroscopic means , the potential age degeneracy may not be broken .",
    "we find cluster ages in the range of 80 to 200myr , a distribution that is consistent with the timescale for the last encounter between m82 and m81 as proposed by @xcite , namely 220myr .",
    "these findings in combination with the larger photometric sample of @xcite , disagree with the ` fossil starburst ' scenario proposed by @xcite , where region b in m82 was identified with the remnant of an off - centre starburst that commenced about 600myr ago , a time scale based on their photometric determinations of star cluster ages .",
    "we suggest that the increased cluster formation rate in region  b is representative of the era of increased star formation across the galaxy disk triggered by the last encounter with m81 .",
    "the extinction along our line of sight in this extended region appears to vary greatly , between 1.1 and 2.5 magnitudes .",
    "as m82 is seen virtually edge - on , we find that presents a view into various depths of the body of the galaxy through an arrangement of ` windows ' in the dust distribution ( as hypothesised for cluster m82-f by * ? ? ?",
    "we also find differential extinction across the face of cluster # 91 ( and also possibly # 108 ) , which sets a serious obstacle in the photometric determination of extinction and age in these cases .",
    "in fact , the effect of dust in this environment is in some cases so grave that photometry can not be used at all as an age / extinction diagnostic .",
    "we have also used the available spectroscopy to derive cluster kinematics .",
    "this allows us to reinforce our extinction - based findings and show that the seven clusters reside at different depths within the disk of m82 .",
    "the large scatter of cluster velocities about the gently rising component of the rotation curve indicates that the clusters do not move in a co - ordinated fashion and that region b can not be bound .",
    "previous studies of clusters f and its neighbour l on the western side of the disk show that they both have an age of @xmath66 myr @xcite .",
    "this age fits in well with the region b cluster age distribution presented in this paper and @xcite , and supports our suggestion that the increase in the cluster formation rate was not local to region b but part of a galaxy - wide burst .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "l ( @xmath68  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply that many lower mass clusters were also likely to have formed with f and l.    in summary , we find region  b to be optically bright owing to the presence of low internal extinction patches , thus offering a deep view into the m82 disk at radii between @xmath1 4001200pc",
    ". the range of cluster ages and other properties in this region then are typical of the evolution of the main body of m82 and reflect the large increase in star formation that occurred about 220myr ago when m82 last passed close to m81 .",
