    "measurements of exclusive hadronic final states in two - photon collisions provide valuable information concerning the physics of light and heavy - quark resonances , perturbative and non - perturbative qcd and hadron - production mechanisms .",
    "so far , we have measured the production cross sections of charged - pion pairs  @xcite , charged and neutral - kaon pairs  @xcite , and proton - antiproton pairs  @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed @xmath7-meson - pair production to search for a new charmonium state  @xcite .    in this report , we show an analysis of neutral - pion pair production in two - photon processes .",
    "the motivation for this study is essentially the same as that for the charged - pion pair case .",
    "but the two processes are physically different and independent ; we can not predict very precisely what happens in one by measuring only the other .    in the low energy region ( @xmath8  gev ) , it is expected that the difference of meson electric charges plays an essential role in the difference between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 cross sections .",
    "the predictions are not easy because of non - perturbative effects . in the intermediate energy range ( @xmath11  gev ) , the formation of meson resonances decaying to @xmath12 is the dominant contribution . for ordinary @xmath13 mesons conserving isospin in decays to @xmath12 ,",
    "the only allowed @xmath14 states produced by two photons are @xmath15(even)@xmath16 , that is , @xmath17 mesons .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath18-meson s branching fractions , @xmath19 is 1/2 from isospin invariance .",
    "but , interference of the resonance with the continuum component which can not be precisely calculated distorts the ratio even near the resonant peaks .",
    "the @xmath10 channel has an advantage in the study of resonances , since a smaller contribution from the continuum is expected in it than in the @xmath9 channel .    for higher energies , we can invoke a quark model . in the leading order calculations",
    "@xcite which take into account spin correlation between quarks , the @xmath10 cross section is predicted to be much smaller than that of @xmath9 , and the cross section ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath9 is around 0.03 - 0.06 . however , higher - order or non - perturbative qcd effects can modify the ratio . for example",
    ", the handbag model which considers soft hadron exchange predicts the same amplitude for the two processes , and this ratio becomes 0.5  @xcite .",
    "analyses of energy and angular distributions of the cross sections are essential for determining properties of the observed resonances and for testing the validity of qcd models .",
    "we present preliminary results of the measurement of the differential cross section , @xmath20 , for the process @xmath0 in a wide two - photon center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy ( @xmath21 ) range from 0.6 to 4.0  gev , and a c.m .",
    "angular range , @xmath22 .",
    "( although we do not need to put the absolute - value symbol for @xmath23 for the present channel where the identical particle pairs appear in both initial and final states , we follow the usual convention of the two - photon differential cross section to avoid unnecessary confusion . ) our data sample is by several hundred times larger than in previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "we use a data sample that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 95  fb@xmath24 recorded with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath25 collider  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the accelerator was set at 10.58  gev ( 83  fb@xmath24 ) , 10.52  gev(9  fb@xmath24 ) , 10.36  gev(@xmath26 runs , 2.9  fb@xmath24 ) and 10.30  gev(0.3  fb@xmath24 ) , in the c.m . energy of the @xmath25 beams .",
    "the difference of the two - photon flux ( luminosity function ) in the measured @xmath21 regions due to the different beam energies is very small ( a few percent at maximum ) , and the fraction of integrated luminosity of the runs with the lower beam energies is very small . we therefore combine the results for different beam energies .",
    "the effect on the cross section deviation is less than 0.5% .",
    "the analysis is made in the `` zero - tag '' mode , where neither the recoil electron nor positron is detected .",
    "we restrict the virtuality of the incident photons to be small by imposing strict transverse - momentum balance with respect to the beam axis for the final - state hadronic system .",
    "a comprehensive description of the belle detector is given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we mention here only those detector components which are essential for the present measurement .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed from hit information in a central drift chamber ( cdc ) located in a uniform 1.5  t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the detector solenoid is along the @xmath27 axis which points in the direction opposite to that of the positron beam .",
    "the cdc and a silicon vertex detector measure the longitudinal and transverse momentum components ( along the @xmath27 axis and in the @xmath28 plane , respectively ) .",
    "photon detection and energy measurements are performed with a csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) .    in the present measurement",
    ", we require that there be no reconstructed tracks coming from the vicinity of the nominal collision point .",
    "therefore , the cdc is used for vetoing events with track(s ) .",
    "photons from decays of two neutral pions are detected and their momentum vectors are measured by the ecl .",
    "signals from the ecl are used to trigger the signal events .",
    "the conditions of the ecl trigger are as follows : the ecl total energy deposit in the triggerable acceptance region ( see the next subsection ) is greater than 1.15  gev ( the hie trigger ) , or , the number of the ecl clusters counted according to the energy threshold at 110  mev for segments of the ecl is four or greater ( the clst4 trigger ) .",
    "the above energy thresholds are determined from the experimental data from a study of the correlations between the two triggers .",
    "no software filterings are applied for triggering events by either or both of the two ecl triggers .",
    "the selection conditions for signal candidates of @xmath29 are as follows : all the variables in the criteria ( 1)-(5 ) are measured in the laboratory frame ; ( 1 ) there is no good track that satisfies @xmath30  cm , @xmath31  cm and @xmath32  gev/@xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the radial and axial distances , respectively , of the closest approach ( as seen in the @xmath28 plane ) to the nominal collision point , and the @xmath36 is the transverse momentum measured in the laboratory frame with respect to the @xmath27 axis ; ( 2 ) the events are triggered by the hie or clst4 triggers ; ( 3 ) there are two or more photons whose energy is greater than 100  mev ; ( 4 ) there are just two @xmath37 s , each having transverse momentum greater than 0.15  gev/@xmath33 , and each of the decay - product photons has energy greater than 70  mev , where the @xmath37 is reconstructed from two photons and is selected with a @xmath38 value of a mass constraint fit ; ( 5 ) the total energy deposit in ecl is smaller than 5.7  gev .    then , the transverse momentum in the @xmath25 c.m .",
    "frame ( @xmath39 ) of the two - pion system is calculated . for further analysis , ( 6 )",
    "we use events with @xmath40  mev/@xmath33 as the signal candidates .    in order to reduce uncertainty from the efficiency of the hardware ecl triggers , we set offline selection criteria which emulate the hardware trigger conditions as follows : ( 7 ) the ecl energy sum within the triggerable region is greater than 1.25  gev , _ or _ all the four photons composing the two @xmath37 are contained in the triggerable acceptance region .",
    "here , we define the triggerable acceptance region as the polar - angle range in the laboratory system @xmath41 .",
    "we derive the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath21 of the two - photon collision from the invariant mass of the two neutral pion system .",
    "we calculate cosine of the scattering angle of @xmath37 in the @xmath42 c.m .",
    "frame , @xmath43 for each event .",
    "we use the @xmath25 collision axis in the @xmath25 c.m .",
    "frame as the reference of the polar angle as an approximation , because we do not know the exact @xmath3 collision axis .    the two - dimensional yield distribution of the selected events is shown by the lego plot in fig .  1 . the @xmath21 distribution with @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "we find at least four resonant structures : clear peaks from @xmath4 near 0.98  gev and @xmath44 near 1.25  gev , and broad structures near 1.65  gev and near 1.95  gev .",
    "figure 2(b ) is an enlarged view of the charmonium region for @xmath45 , where we see some hints of charmonium contributions in the @xmath5(@xmath46  gev ) and @xmath47(@xmath48  gev ) mass region .",
    "we study the @xmath36-balance distribution , i.e. , the event distribution in @xmath39 to separate the signal and background components .",
    "the signal monte carlo ( mc ) events show that the signal component peaks around 10 - 20  mev/@xmath33 in this distribution . in the experimental data , however , in addition to such a signal component",
    ", we find some contribution from the @xmath36-unbalanced components in the low-@xmath21 region .",
    "the source of such @xmath36-unbalanced components , in general , is considered to be non - exclusive processes such as @xmath49 etc .",
    "but , in the present case , the background found in the experimental data is very large only in the low @xmath21 region where the @xmath49 contribution is expected to be much smaller than @xmath10 in two - photon collisions .",
    "( note that a @xmath50-parity odd system can not go to @xmath10 . )",
    "we believe that the backgrounds are dominated by beam - background photons ( or neutral pions from secondary interactions ) or spurious hits in the detector .",
    "figures 3 ( a ) and ( b ) show the @xmath36-balance distributions in the low @xmath21 region . with the fit described below , we separate the signal components from the background . in the intermediate or higher energy regions ,",
    "the backgrounds are less than 1% , buried under the @xmath44 peak ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) , or we do not see any detectable @xmath36-unbalanced components within the statistical errors ( as shown in fig .",
    "even at the highest energy 3.6  gev@xmath51  gev , @xmath45 , we find no visible contamination from the background .",
    "a fit to the @xmath36-balance distribution is made to separate the signal and background components for the @xmath21 region below 1.2  gev .",
    "the fit function is a sum of the signal component and the background component .",
    "the signal component is taken as an empirical function reproducing the shape of the signal mc , @xmath52 , where ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath50 are the fitting parameters , and @xmath56 is the distribution ) .",

    "the background yields integrated over the angle is shown in fig .",

    "the momentum resolution of @xmath37 is known to be worse by about 15% in the experimental data than in mc from a study of the @xmath36-balance distributions ( described in sect .",

    "the peak position is consistent with the nominal mass of @xmath73 with an accuracy better than 0.2% .",

    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "we made an unfolding of the invariant - mass distribution in each @xmath63 bin separately , to correct for migrations of signal yields between different @xmath21 bins , based on the smearing function of the above asymmetric gaussian shape .",

    "the unfolding is made using the singular value decomposition ( svd ) algorithm  @xcite in the yield level , and is applied so as to reproduce the corrected @xmath21 distribution in the 0.9 - 2.4  gev region , using data at observed @xmath21 between 0.72 and 3.0  gev . for lower energies , @xmath74  gev ,",
