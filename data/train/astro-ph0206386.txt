    "from the first identification of type  ic supernovae ( sn  ic ) as a distinguishable spectral subclass @xcite it has been recognized that they represent the collapse of bare non - degenerate , carbon / oxygen cores @xcite .",
    "most display a range in peak absolute magnitudes from -16.5 to -18.5 , but some may be considerably brighter , exceeding -19 @xcite without showing excessive velocities or light curve anomalies .",
    "they also show a variety of rates of decay from maximum @xcite .",
    "the best guess is that they represent the collapse of the core of a massive star that has lost most or all of both its hydrogen and helium layers .",
    "the remaining core mass and hence ejecta mass is expected to show some dispersion that will be reflected in the properties of the observed explosions .",
    "in addition , the suspicion that all core collapse supernovae , and even more so all sn  ic , are strongly asymmetric @xcite suggests that there will be significant observer line - of - sight effects that can be manifest in the luminosity and photospheric velocity as well as the spectropolarimetry .",
    "the observed properties , especially the photospheric velocity , are also expected to be strong functions of epoch with higher velocities at earlier times .",
    "the advent of sn  1998bw and its apparent connection with grb  980425 @xcite drew new attention to the general class of sn  ic .",
    "sn  1998bw displayed large photospheric velocities early on and was a strong source of radio radiation implying some relativistic ejecta @xcite , although an especially weak @xmath3-ray burst . at about the same time",
    "@xcite coined the term  hypernova \" to specifically mean the events with large optical luminosity that were associated with @xmath3-ray bursts  and their afterglows .",
    "this term was adopted by some in the supernova community to represent supernovae , sn  1998bw in particular , that seemed to be excessively bright and to require very large amounts of kinetic energy and ejected  mass @xcite . since that time , the term  hypernova \" has been used to apply to events that resemble sn  ic , but have large photospheric velocities , whether or not they are especially bright @xcite .",
    "these developments raise the issue of whether  hypernovae \" as the term is applied to hydrogen - deficient supernovae is really a separate class with excessively large kinetic energy and ejected  mass or whether these supernovae can be explained in terms of the normal range of properties , including asymmetries , associated with bare carbon / oxygen core collapse @xcite .",
    "sn  2002ap has attracted much attention because early spectra showed a lack of hydrogen and helium characteristic of sn  ic and broad velocity components @xcite , which , as mentioned above , have been taken as one characteristic of  hypernovae .",
    "\" the nature , existence of , and import of  hypernovae \" remains to be clarified , and the study of sn  2002ap presents an important opportunity .",
    "this supernovae was not associated with a @xmath3-ray burst , was not especially bright @xcite , and was a weak radio source @xcite . since its only special property seems to be a high photospheric velocity at early times , study of the velocity in the context of geometrical asymmetries may shed light on the general category of  hypernovae . \"",
    "a particularly important issue is to understand whether asymmetries could be affecting the interpretation of the kinematics , luminosity , kinetic energy , nickel mass , ejected mass , and progenitor mass of the supernova . the prime tool to investigate the geometry of distant supernovae is spectropolarimetry @xcite . here",
    "we present spectropolarimetry of sn  2002ap from about six days before to about one day after peak visual magnitude .",
    "this is the first time that the temporal evolution of the polarization has been studied in a type ib / c and the first time that such early polarimetry has been obtained of a type ib / c .",
    "@xcite studied supernova polarimetry published before 1996 and found that type ia supernovae are normally not polarized and on average show much lower polarization than core - collapse supernovae ( type ii , ib / c ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent data indicated a higher degree of polarization for the bare - core or low mass events such as type iib , and ib / c supernovae , than for more massive ejecta @xcite .",
    "the degree of polarization is a function of time after explosion . for core - collapse events ,",
    "the degree of polarization is higher past optical maximum than before optical maximum @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the polarization of the type ic sn  1997x that was exceptionally high , around 7 percent .",
    "some of this is probably interstellar in origin , but the suggestion remains that  bare core \" supernovae like sn ic are very highly distorted .",
    "there was only one epoch of data on sn  1997x .",
    "sn  2002ap gives the opportunity to study the polarization evolution of a type ib / c event in unprecedented detail .",

    "galactic reddening on the line of sight to m74 is also low , e(b - v ) = 0.008 mag @xcite .",
    "the observations were obtained in service mode through our target of opportunity program at the eso - vlt .",

    "this system uses a fiera controller for ccd readout .",
    "the grism gris-300v ( eso number 10 ) was used for all observations .",
    "the order separation filter gg 435 + 31 ( 4 ) was used in some observations to study the ca ii ir triplet , but was also taken out to observe spectral features in the blue end .",
    "the supernova was always observed in four subsequent separate exposures with the position angle of the wollaston prism at 0.0 , 45.0 , 22.5 , and 67.5 .",
    "the @xmath5 retarder plates are of the `` superachromatic '' type , and the position angles can be set with an accuracy of 0.1 degree .",
    "the chromatic zero angles were set by the data provided in the vlt fors1 user manual @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution for these observations is around 12.7   as measured from the spectral calibration lamps  with each pixel corresponding to about 2.6   in wavelength scale .",
    "a slit of 1.0  wide was used for all these observations .",
    "we have also obtained images for bias correction , wavelength calibration , and flat fielding for each observing run . the wavelength calibration and flat fielding images",

    "the flat field images of each run are combined to form the final flat field correction image that is applied to each data set .",
    "standard data reduction procedures including bias correction , flat - fielding , background subtraction , spectrum extraction , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration were performed using the iraf package @xcite .",
    "the polarized spectra were reduced using our own software .",
    "the per - pixel photon statistical errors of the q and u vectors of the vlt data were typically below 0.1% .",
    "stokes parameters were rebinned to a 15   interval @xcite .",
    "the binning was done by calculating the average polarization within a bin weighted by the number of detected photons within each pixel @xcite .",
    "the 15   binning was chosen so that it is slightly larger than the spectral resolution of the data ( 12.7  ) to eliminate sampling errors of the resolution element .",
    "the rebinning is equivalent to calculating the degree of polarization of all photons integrated in each bin ; when the bin size is larger than the resolution element , the errors of the stokes parameters in each wavelength bin are uncorrelated .",
    "typical photon statistical errors in the q and u vector after binning to the 15   interval are around 0.02% for all of these observations and are not a major source of error in the discussion of these data . during the commissioning of fors1 in 1998/1999 the systematic instrumental polarization of fors1 was found to be less than 0.1% ( szeifert 1999 , private communication ) .",

    ", one can identify oi @xmath2 777.4 , shallow si ii , he i @xmath2 587.6 or na i d and blue emission due to fe ii at about 550 nm and 450 nm .",
    "this evolution is reflected in the total flux spectra shown here in figs . 1  3 .",
    "nir spectra show c i at 940 , 1068 and 1069 nm over an extended period of time ( gerardy et al . in preparation ) , but no he i at 2.058 @xmath7 m on 8 march @xcite .",
    "in addition , the nir spectra show no evidence for the strong ni / co blends at 1.6 to 1.8 @xmath7 m that are typical of sn  ia . as we will argue below",
    ", this suggests that no radioactive elements have been lifted to or beyond the photosphere at early times .",
    "the early optical / nir spectra are consistent with a carbon / oxygen atmosphere .",
    "to derive the intrinsic polarization due to the supernova atmosphere , we first need to deduce the component due to interstellar dust .",
    "we use the method outlined in @xcite that assumes that at each specific epoch , the polarization produced by the supernova ejecta has a single polarization position angle independent of wavelength .",
    "this method demands that the interstellar polarization falls along the dominant axis and must remain fixed independent of the epoch .",
    "we find the interstellar polarization to be at @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we will adopt this as the best estimate of the interstellar polarization as shown by the black solid dot in the upper panels of figs . 1  3 . in each of those panels",
    ", the black solid line connects the chosen value of the isp to the origin of the q - u plane .",
    "the galactic extinction is e(b - v ) = 0.008 @xcite , which would produce a maximum degree of polarization too small to account for the 0.6%  interstellar polarization .",
    "most of the isp and associated extinction are thus most likely to be in the host galaxy .",
    "this analysis yields a polarization position angle of 24   for the interstellar polarization .",
    "it is not clear that this corresponds to any special direction in m74 .",
    "@xcite outlined a method to decompose the observed polarimetry into two components . on the q - u plot",
    ", the two components correspond to the polarized vectors projected onto the so - called dominant axis ( denoted by subscript  d \" below ) and the axis orthogonal to the dominant axis ( denoted by subscript  o \" below ) .",
    "the dominant axis can be defined from the aspherical distribution of the data points on the q - u plane .",
    "the dominant axis is derived by a linear fit to the data points weighted by the observational errors in the q - u plane .",
    "the spectropolarimetry projected to the dominant axis represents global geometric deviations from spherical symmetry whereas the vector orthogonal to the dominant axis represents deviations from the dominant axis .",
    "these components are defined as : @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polarization components parallel to the dominant axis and orthogonal to that axis , respectively , and  and  are the stokes parameters of the interstellar polarization .    in simple spheroidal models @xcite , the polarization is produced by electron scattering through an aspherical atmosphere , and the spectropolarimetric lines are formed because of line scattering and depolarization .",
    "such a geometry would produce a single line on the q - u plot , with the wavelength region that suffered the most line scattering being most de - polarized and hence the closest to the origin .",
    "the earliest data on sn  2002ap , from 3 feb , approaches such a situation .",
    "we show in the top panels of figs",
    ". 1 to 3 the observed data points in the q - u plane . each point",
    "represent a data pair corresponding to the q - u vector at a different wavelength .",
    "the wavelength of the data points in important intervals are encoded in color .",
    "the data show remarkable evolution during the three epochs of observation .",
    "the polarization also shows spectral features that can be identified with features in the flux spectra .",
    "this firmly establishes that sn 2002ap was intrinsically polarized well before optical maximum .",
    "the components parallel and orthogonal to the dominant axis as given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 are plotted in the second panels of figs .",
    "1  3 where it can be seen that the @xmath13 component is fairly flat except near the 750 nm feature .",
    "most of the continuum polarization is recorded in @xmath12 . the continuum polarization ( around 600 to 650 nm ) in nearly zero in the 3 feb data , perhaps slightly positive by 7 feb , and",
    "shows a definite positive value , about 0.2 percent by 10 feb .",
    "this suggests that the global distortion was increasing with time .",
    "the situation is more complicated , however , than can be interpreted with a simple spheroid model since other components with different principle axes are revealed in the later data .",
    "the third panels of figs . 1  3 show the total flux and the polarized flux in the dominant and orthogonal components . polarized spectral features are unambiguously detected around o ii 777.4 nm , na i d ( or he i 587.6 nm ) and in the blue around 400 nm where the feature is probably due to fe ii . the wavelength at which the degree of polarization reaches maximum was around 730 nm on 3 feb , moved to about 720 nm on 7 feb , and to 700 nm on 10 feb .",
    "sn 2002ap exhibits features that are unlike those of previously observed sn ii and the subluminous sn ia 1999by @xcite . on the q - u plot , sn 1998s and sn 1999by showed well - defined linear features @xcite indicating relatively well - defined symmetry axes .",
    "sn  2002ap shows this behavior in the earliest data presented in the top panel of fig . 1 for the data of 3 feb ( -6 d ) .",
    "by 7 feb ( -2 d ; top panel , fig .",
    "2 ) , the dominant axis had shifted .",
    "one interpretation is that the dominant axis has rotated by about 24  to become approximately parallel to the solid line connecting the axis and the isp point in the q - u plane .",
    "this would indicate a change of orientation in the supernova ejecta of about 12 .",
    "a rotation of axes of this sort could be due to the recession of the photosphere by different amounts in different directions in response to the asymmetric velocity field and density distribution @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the locus of lower points in the first panel of fig .",
    "2 could represent a shift of the dominant axis in the first panel of fig . 1 parallel to itself .",
    "this could occur if there is a growing wavelength - independent scattering that everywhere increases the amplitude of the polarization of this dominant component . by 10 feb ( + 1 d ; top panel , fig .",
    "3 ) there has been a further shift of the dominant axis roughly parallel to that of 3 feb or 7 feb and the development of a component nearly orthogonal to that dominant axis in the q - u plane .",
    "the strongest feature in the polarization spectra is the line at 740 nm .",
    "this feature peaks in the dominant component ( second panel of figs . 1  3 ) at 1.1 percent , nearly 1.4 percent and 0.9 percent , for 3 feb , 7 feb , and 10 feb , respectively .",
    "the feature is smaller in the polarized flux plots ( third panels ) , but still prominent .",
    "this polarization feature narrows and its peak shifts to the blue over the epoch observed .",
    "@xcite noted that if this feature were the ca ii ir triplet , the implied velocity would be about 45,000 .",
    "closer study and especially the time - dependent behavior reveals that ca ii is not the correct identification .",
    "rather , the behavior of this feature is most consistent with the line being predominantly o i 777.4 nm that is eaten away by the emergence of the ca ii ir triplet as the supernova evolves to maximum light . with this identification ,",
    "the velocity is about 20,000 .    the wavelength range that spans the o i feature also serves to define the dominant component in the top panel of fig . 1 as denoted by the dashed line .",
    "note that there is some suggestion of two approximately parallel components with this dominant orientation , although the lower component ( along q @xmath0 -0.2 ) may not be statistically significant . by 7 feb ,",
    "the shift or rotation of the dominant component is basically a property of the o i line , with little shift in other wavelengths .",
    "certainly , the original component defined by the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 has disappeared by the epoch represented in fig .",
    "2 . the top panel of fig . 3 shows again that the parallel displacement of the original dominant component is once again primarily a manifestation of the wavelengths corresponding to the o i line .",
    "the displacement of the o i component parallel to the original dominant axis as the supernova evolves is presumably caused by the increase in the continuum polarization and perhaps by a shift in the geometry as the photosphere recedes by different amounts along different directions @xcite .",
    "the line is presumably polarized because of  shadowing \" of parts of the asymmetric line emitting region by portions of the ejecta that remain optically thick .",
    "quantitative analysis of such effects will require detailed radiative transfer models that we postpone to later work .    by 10 feb ,",
    "shortly after maximum light , there is obviously a new absorption component at 770 nm as shown in the middle and bottom panels of fig 3 .",
    "we interpret this as due to the ca ii ir triplet , in which case it also represents a velocity of about 20,000 .",
    "the interpretation of the double dips at about 680 nm and 770 nm in the orthogonal component ( second panels ) in figs . 1 and 2 is not clear .",
    "their amplitude depends rather sensitively on the choice of the isp .",
    "we believe the feature at 550 nm is most likely to be na i d. this feature becomes especially prominent on 7 feb in the polarized flux ( panel 3 , fig .",
    "2 ) , but then less so by 10 feb ( panel 3 , fig .",
    "3 ) . the wavelengths corresponding to this feature cluster around q @xmath0 0 and u @xmath0 0 in the top panel of fig .",
    "1 . by 7 feb and 10 feb , the corresponding wavelengths are still tightly bunched in the q - u plane , but the bunch has shifted slightly along the direction of the solid line in figs . 2 and 3 .    this feature could be either he i 587.6 nm or na i d. we favor the latter because of the lack of other evidence for helium . in particular , the he 2.08 @xmath7 m line was not observed in nir spectra taken several weeks later , 8 march @xcite .",
    "this may be because the abundance is low and the helium is confined to the outermost layers , but there can not be a strong exposure of any helium to radioactive excitation at that time @xcite . other constraints on helium arise from earlier nir spectra , some contemporaneous with the optical spectropolarimetry we present here , that also fail to show any evidence for the he 2.08 @xmath7 m line ( gerardy et al . in preparation ) .",
    "if the line at 550 nm were he i 587.6 , then the associated line at 2.08 @xmath7 m should be unambiguous .",
    "we note that a similar feature at 550 nm was seen in sn  1993j .",
    "@xcite argue that an nlte enhancement of a factor of @xmath14 would have been required to account for the feature as he i 587.6 , making that feature more likely to be na i d as well .",
    "the na is surely out of nlte , and quantitative models are required to explore whether na can account for the behavior seen here in sn  2002ap , or in sn  1993j .",
    "the third prominent feature in the polarization spectra is that at about 450 nm . in fig .",
    "1 , this feature is likely to be fe ii .",
    "a similar feature was seen in the spectropolarimetry of sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "this fe is likely to just be the primordial iron present within the outer carbon / oxygen envelope since features associated with iron freshly synthesized by radioactive decay are not seen ( see  4 below ) .",
    "this polarization peak has essentially vanished in the later data . in fig .",
    "1 , this feature seems to have a spread parallel to the dominant axis in the q - u plane , displaced from the location of the sodium feature and perhaps coincident with the lower q component of the o i line , inasmuch as that data marginally resolves into two parallel components (  3.3 ) . by 7 feb",
    ", this displacement has disappeared and any remaining iron feature is essentially contiguous with the sodium feature at q @xmath0 -0.2 and u @xmath0 -0.2 .",
    "although the signal to noise is degraded , there is a dramatic change in this blue feature by 10 feb when it seems to define a new axis with a very different orientation from the dominant axes of 3 feb and 7 feb .",
    "this new feature may be associated with ca ii h & k , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we note that this polarization feature at 400 nm on 3 feb is interrupted by a sharp minimum at 390 nm in the polarization spectra of fig .",
    "1 . this narrow feature might be interstellar ca ii h & k in the galaxy or in m74 or in the circumstellar matter near the supernova .",
    "there is no easily discernible feature in the total flux spectrum .",
    "in addition , the feature appears to be transient .",
    "while the data do not extend sufficiently far to the blue to define this region on 7 feb , there is little sign of this feature in the polarization data of 10 feb .",
    "this might suggest that this feature is connected with the circumstellar matter very near the supernova , but it may be that the feature is an artifact of the sensitivity near the blue end of the spectrum .",
    "the polarization evolution allows us to extract some useful information about the ejecta structure . as a first approximation",
    ", we will assume that close to the photosphere the ejecta can be modeled as a prolate or oblate spheroid .",
    "we define the asphericity of the spheroid as the ratio of the major to minor axes ratio minus 1 , expressed as a percentage .",
    "the relation between this geometric asymmetry and the angular distribution of the luminosity for an electron - scattering atmosphere is taken from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this spheroid approximation may reproduce the orientation and distortion along the dominant axis of asymmetry .",
    "the photosphere itself is likely to be more irregularly structured , so the spheroid is only an approximation . in particular , in an asymmetric explosion , during homologous expansion the location of the photosphere will depend on the profile of density as a function of velocity and that profile will depend on angle .",
    "the photosphere will recede at different rates in different directions yielding isodensity contours that are not simply ellipsoidal .",
    "an illustration is given in fig .",
    "4 ( from hflich , wang & wheeler 1999 )    the maximum degree of continuum polarization is nearly zero on 3 feb implying little distortion of the photosphere .",
    "this suggests that the outer envelope has not been penetrated by any bipolar flow or other perturbation that would give a severe distortion and a large polarization , but the low polarization could also be consistent with viewing down the symmetry axis . since the continuum polarization evolves to higher values , the latter can not be the full explanation of the early low polarization , although orientation effects clearly play a role .    by 10 feb",
    "the continuum polarization has increased to about 0.2 percent .",
    "this would be consistent with an asphericity of @xmath0 10 - 15 percent for an ellipse observed along the equator @xcite .",
    "this polarization amplitude must be interpreted carefully , since it is also accompanied with strong evolution of the polarization spectra and with the rotation or displacement of the dominant axis and the appearance of new axes in the q - u plane .",
    "how , then , might one account for a principle polarization axis of sn 2002ap seen on 3 feb , the possible rotation by 24  on 7 feb , and the appearance of a new axis of orientation on 10 feb ?",
    "detailed modeling with 3-d radiative transfer is required to fully understand the polarization data @xcite .",
    "this analysis will be presented elsewhere . here",
    "we will discuss some of the physical possibilities .",
    "important constraints come from the combined consideration of the polarization data and the nir spectroscopy ( gerardy et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we have identified here , with the critical help of the polarization evolution , the feature due to o i 777.4 nm .",
    "the lack of evidence for the he 2.08 @xmath7 m line argues that the feature at 590 nm is na i d. the nir spectra do reveal strong lines of c i at 940.5 , 1068.3 and 1069.1 nm .",
    "on the other hand , the nir spectra fail to show the strong lines blends of nickel and cobalt at 1.6 - 1.8 @xmath7 m that are routinely shown by type ia supernovae ( @xcite ; marion et al . in preparation ) that represent freshly synthesized radioactive decay products .",
    "this combined information suggests that the outer portions of the atmosphere of sn  2002ap are rich in carbon and oxygen with a small , if any , layer of helium , as expected for an sn  ic .",
    "the lack of the nickel / cobalt features at 1.6 - 1.8 @xmath7 m strongly suggests that radioactive matter has not penetrated the photosphere at the earliest epochs reported here .",
    "thus we conclude that there has been a major perturbation of the ejecta in a manner that leads to a dominant axis of symmetry as revealed in the q -u plane of the early data ( 3 feb ) , but that the predominantly bi - polar flow that shaped such an asymmetry has not penetrated the surface of the star during the explosion .",
    "the photosphere can potentially evolve in a rather complex way in response to density and velocity anisotropies in the ejecta , as illustrated by @xcite . in that example",
    ", high velocities along the axis of symmetry led to especially rapid recession of the photosphere along the axis , leading to a roughly quadrupolar isodensity contour structure at intermediate times ( fig .",
    "this evolution in the isodensity contours of a nominally oblate shape could lead to the shift in the orientation of the dominant axis and could help to explain some of the behavior seen in figs .",
    "the emergence of a second dominant axis in the 10 feb data clearly reveals a separate kinematic component .",
    "some of this component may be reflected in the o i and ca ii features , but it is predominantly a feature in the blue .",
    "this could be the emergence of ca ii h & k in the blue at the same time that the effect of the ca ii ir triplet is being manifest in the red . in jet - induced models , the calcium is expected to be confined to equatorial tori @xcite .",
    "this new axis is rotated compared to the dominant axis of the 3 feb data by about 100  in the q - u plane , corresponding to about 50  in physical space .",
    "this is consistent with having an outer photosphere with a ",
    "quadrupolar \" structure reflected in the oxygen ( and presumably carbon ) that is tilted by about 50  with respect to the equator and then a deeper torus of calcium - rich matter on the equator .",
    "understanding the 3-d nature of core collapse supernovae , especially ",
    "naked core \" events is an important key to the underlying physics , and polarimetry is the best tool to probe multi - dimensional effects .",
    "sn  2002ap resembles other type ib / c events , but displays rather broad lines near maximum .",
    "the distinct polarization spectra show that the ejecta are asymmetric .",
    "the premaximum polarization spectra reveal a strong feature of o i 777.4 nm and probably na i d , both moving at about 20,000 . near maximum light , a new dominant axis is revealed as defined , most likely , by calcium again with a velocity of about 20,000 .",
    "these observations can be accounted for in a model in which a bi - polar flow from the exploding core imposes a predominantly prolate velocity structure and oblate density structure .",
    "the outer photosphere at early times can thus have a complex structure with an effective dominant axis that is intermediate between the axis of symmetry and the equator .",
    "later observations would reveal a more predominantly oblate structure oriented along the equatorial plane , as observed .",
    "this picture is supported by the lack of observations in the nir of freshly synthesized nickel and cobalt as seen in type ia , suggesting that the bi - polar flow has induced velocity and density asymmetries , but has not penetrated the photosphere at early times so that these freshly synthesized elements are not observed .",
    "we find no evidence for substantial amounts of matter moving at 45,000 , which was mentioned as a possibility by @xcite .",
    "the relatively high velocities that are observed , about 20,000 , broaden the lines compared to some other type ic , for instance sn  1994i @xcite .",
    "this can be accounted for by a combination of different ejecta mass and an asymmetric ejecta . in general , a higher ejecta mass and perhaps a steeper density gradient at the photosphere , can prolong the phase in which the photosphere resides in higher velocity material .",
    "we note also that the earliest spectra of sn  2002ap were obtained substantially before maximum light , a rare happenstance for sn  ic events . in addition to this basic effect of the ejecta mass , the asymmetry of the ejecta will bring line - of - sight effects .",
    "as shown by @xcite the isodensity contours can be rather irregular , with a quadrupole - like distortion as the ejecta expand more rapidly along the poles , even for an ellipsoidal density distribution . for a more realistic bi - polar explosion the density contours can be even more complicated .",
    "thus there may be special viewing angles along which the homologous expansion is relatively slow , leading to a delayed recession of the photosphere and hence to a larger line - of - sight photospheric velocity at a given epoch . in any case",
    ", it is clear that while a proper interpretation of polarized , asymmetric ejecta is tricky , it is certainly risky to interpret observations of asymmetric ejecta in terms of a spherically symmetric model and to take the results literally .",
    "the luminosity of sn  2002ap was consistent with a normal type ib / c , there was no @xmath3-ray burst , and the radio observations are consistent with only a modest ejection of high - velocity matter @xcite .",
    "the relatively high early photospheric velocities of sn  2002ap with respect to other sn  ic , may then just be a question of epoch of observation , mass of ejecta , and orientation angle of the observer , and not a hint of exceptional properties .",
    "if one can interpret sn  2002ap as a variation on the  normal \" theme of type ib / c supernovae , then perhaps one should reconsider the general category of  hypernovae . \" in the context of supernovae ( as opposed to paczyski s original definition ) , sn  19998bw is the prototype of this proposed new category with large kinetic energy , ejecta mass , nickel mass and luminosity attributed to it in the context of spherically - symmetric models .",
    "@xcite determined that the exploding carbon / oxygen core had a mass of 12 to 15  with kinetic energy in the range 20 to 50@xmath15 erg and mass of  in the range 0.6 to 0.8 .",
    "@xcite favored a carbon / oxygen core of 6 , a kinetic energy of @xmath16 erg and a mass of  of 0.5 .",
    "both of these models had some problems reproducing the spectra or light curves .",
    "this class of models also had problems reproducing the late time tails .",
    "the predicted light curves tended to drop too quickly .",
    "another intrinsic problem is that these spherical models with very high kinetic energy imposed at the base of the ejecta predict very high minimum velocities .",
    "the latter two problems are related .",
    "the rapid expansion of the innermost layers cause them to thin out , thus decreasing the @xmath3-ray  deposition and causing the drop in the light curve .",
    "by contrast , a somewhat schematic model by @xcite showed that a good fit could be obtained to the multi - color light curves of sn  1998bw near maximum with an asymmetric model .",
    "this model required somewhat higher kinetic energy and  mass , @xmath17 erg and 0.2 , respectively , but not sufficiently large values to warrant defining a new category of  hypernovae . \" furthermore , models of jet - induced supernovae @xcite showed that asymmetric models would undergo circulation and inflow that would yield much smaller minimum velocities than the corresponding spherical models .",
    "these small minimum velocities were revealed by late time observations of sn  1998bw ( patat et al .",
    "the slow moving matter will , in principle , allow for greater trapping of @xmath3-rays  at later times and hence flatter late - time light curves requiring less , all else being equal .",
    "@xcite also conclude that asymmetric explosions can lead to slower moving matter near the center , but they only explored very high mass carbon / oxygen cores in the context of sn  1998bw , and hence concluded once again that high kinetic energy is required to match sn  1998bw .",
    "estimates of the amount of  required to power the light curve of sn  1998bw have also evolved with time .",
    "based on the first 123 days , @xcite estimated a minimum of 0.2 . while this number agreed with the estimate of @xcite , it was considerably less than the estimates based on the first spherically - symmetric light curve models .",
    "a later , very careful analysis of the late - time light curve , especially hst photometry at 800 to 1000 d , by @xcite showed that a simple model could fit the light curve with only 0.3  of .",
    "more sophisticated models allowing for the slowly expanding and efficiently trapping inner layers expected from asymmetric models might very well do the job with less",
    ". there is , in any case , little rationale for the early large estimates of  mass based on spherical models . in this context",
    ", we note that the ejected  mass for normal sn  ii is reported to range as high as 0.3  @xcite .",
    "@xcite report an implied  mass of 2.6  for sn  1997cy , but this number is so discrepant with other determinations of the  mass that we are tempted to assume a substantial proportion of the luminosity of this event arise from circumstellar interaction .",
    "more events like sn  1997cy will have to be discovered to clarify this situation .",
    "if one removes the seeming excessively large nickel mass and can , in principle , account for the observed optical luminosity of sn  1998bw by invoking the angle - dependent luminosity expected from asymmetric models , and can account for the large photospheric velocities by a judicious choice of ejecta mass and viewing angle , then one still has the active possibility that sn  1998bw was an event at the high end of the  normal \" range of sn  ic supernovae with twice the kinetic energy and twice the nickel mass of  normal \" sn  ic .",
    "one does not necessarily need to define a whole new class of  hypernovae \" to account for it .",
    "similar arguments can account for events that are perceived to be intermediate between sn  1998bw and sn  1994i , such as sn1998ef .",
    "even if one does not accept that one can account for the observations of sn  1998bw , sn  1998ef , and sn  2002ap in terms of mild variations and rather extreme asymmetries , the polarimetry shows that sn  1998bw and sn  2002ap , at least , were asymmetric and this must be taken into account .",
    "the @xmath3-ray burst  community recognized the key role that collimation plays in @xmath3-ray bursts  by adopting the language of  isotropic equivalent energy \" in appropriate contexts when spherically symmetric models were applied to asymmetric situations .",
    "perhaps it is time for the supernova community to do that as well and learn to speak of isotropic equivalent energies , ejecta masses , and nickel masses when spherically - symmetric models are inappropriately applied to asymmetric situations .",
    "the authors are grateful to the european southern observatory for the generous allocation of observing time .",
    "they especially thank the staff of the paranal observatory for their competent and untiring support of this project in service mode . this work was supported in part by nasa grant nag5 - 7937 to pah and",
