    "this is our second paper of a series devoted to the thermal properties of a pure gauge theory within a five - dimensional framework nowadays known as ads / qcd . we explore further the model proposed in the first paper @xcite .",
    "it is based on the following euclidean background metric    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a periodic variable of period @xmath2 such that @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , the temperature . at zero temperature",
    ", we have in fact the slightly deformed @xmath5 metric .",
    "such a deformation is notable because it results in a regge - like spectrum .",
    "this fact allows one to fix the value of @xmath6 from the @xmath7 meson trajectory . for our purposes ,",
    "we use the estimate of @xcite    @xmath8    it is worth noting that the metric contain any free fit parameter . moreover , the only dimensionful parameter of our model is the regge slope of meson trajectories .",
    "it is quite unusual for qcd , where it is @xmath9 .",
    "thus , evaluations of thermodynamic quantities and the polyakov loop we are going to undertake can be considered as a further consistency check of our model .    for the case of interest ,",
    "let us briefly point out a couple of facts .",
    "\\(i ) the free energy of a heavy ( static ) quark - antiquark pair at finite temperature is expressed in terms of a correlator of two polyakov loops @xcite    @xmath10    with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being a point in @xmath13 . in the free energy",
    "is defined up to a normalization constant @xmath14 which is related to the infinite self - energy of the quarks .",
    "there is a subtle point here . in the literature @xmath15",
    "is often called the heavy quark potential at finite temperature .",
    "apparently , such a definition discards the entropy contribution .",
    "an order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement phase transition is the expectation value of the polyakov loop .",
    "after the normalization of , it is then    @xmath16    \\(ii ) in discussing a wilson line within ads / cft ( qcd ) @xcite , one first chooses a contour @xmath17 on a four - manifold which is the boundary of a five - dimensional manifold .",
    "next , one has to study fundamental strings on this manifold such that the string world - sheet has @xmath17 for its boundary .",
    "the expectation value of the loop is schematically given by the world - sheet path integral    @xmath18    where @xmath19 denotes a set of world - sheet fields .",
    "@xmath20 is a world - sheet action .    in principle , the integral can be evaluated semiclassically in terms of minimal surfaces that obey the boundary conditions .",
    "the result is written as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 means a regularized minimal area whose relative weight is @xmath23 .. ]    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we develop the framework we will work . in section 3 , we present , on the basis of ads / qcd , a few results on a heavy quark - antiquark pair in a thermal medium . in particular , we exhibit the free energy , the string tension , and the entropy at low temperatures as well as the polyakov loop expectation value .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a discussion of some open problems .",
    "our basic approach will be as follows .",
    "it is believed that the correlator of the two polyakov loops has a path integral representation like that of the wilson loop .",
    "given the background metric , we can attempt to evaluate the values of the regularized areas @xmath22 .",
    "if we then discard quantum fluctuations of strings , in the case of one dominant exponent we will get that the free energy is simply proportional to a proper @xmath24    @xmath25    note that the regularized areas are defined up to normalization constants .",
    "since these constants are in fact due to the infinite self - energy of the quark sources , we omit @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath26 can be absorbed into a proper normalization constant too . in this paper",
    "we will use the approximation .",
    "but before going on , let us shortly pause here to gain some intuition about the problem at hand . as in @xcite , we introduce the notion of an effective string tension depending on the fifth coordinate @xmath27",
    ". it is given by    @xmath28    now consider the behavior of a string bit in the effective potential @xmath29 .",
    "an important observation is that the form of @xmath30 is temperature dependent .",
    "indeed , a short algebra shows that there is a special value of temperature @xmath31 . below @xmath32",
    "the effective potential has local extrema at    @xmath33    while above this temperature the potential is just a decreasing function of @xmath27 as shown in fig.1 .",
    "such a behavior clearly has some of the suspected properties of gauge theory at finite temperature . for temperatures below @xmath32 the string ended on the heavy quark - antiquark pair set at @xmath34 can not get deeper than @xmath35 in @xmath27 direction because a repulsive force prevents it from doing so",
    "this gives rise somewhat of a wall located at @xmath36 .",
    "the large distance physics of the string is determined by this wall .",
    "since the value of the effective potential ( string tension ) at its minimum is not vanishing , the quark - antiquark free energy has a dominant linear term whose coefficient is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "so , this can indeed be interpreted as the low temperature phase . on the other hand , for temperatures above",
    "@xmath32 the string can get deeper and finally reach the horizon @xmath38 .",
    "the large distance physics is now determined by the near horizon geometry .",
    "the crucial point is that the effective potential vanishes on the horizon . as a result",
    ", there is no linear term in the quark - antiquark free energy .",
    "this can be interpreted as the deconfined phase .",
    "now let us go back to the approach and choose a pair of the contours ( polyakov loops ) living on the boundary ( @xmath34 ) of our five dimensional space .",
    "we set    @xmath39    next we want to look for static configurations of the world - sheet action . to this end , we make use of the nambu - goto action equipped with the background metric    @xmath40    there are basically two types of configurations to be considered .",
    "one type describes connected surfaces whose boundaries are the polyakov loops , while another describes disconnected surfaces",
    ".    our first goal will be to analyze connected surfaces . in this case",
    "the world - sheet coordinates @xmath41 s can be chosen as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "with such a choice , the action takes the form    @xmath44    where @xmath45 .",
    "a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "it is easy to find the equation of motion for @xmath27    @xmath47    as well as its first integral @xmath48    on symmetry grounds , we have @xmath49 .",
    "this allows us to express the integration constant @xmath50 via the value of @xmath27 at @xmath51 .",
    "so , we get    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is defined by and @xmath54 .",
    "next we perform the integral over @xmath55 $ ] of @xmath56 . by virtue of",
    ", it is given by    @xmath57    where @xmath17 is a contour in @xmath27 plane .",
    "we look for solutions that obey the following condition @xmath58 .",
    "the reason for this is that , on general grounds , the string ended on the quarks set at @xmath59 reaches the deepest point in @xmath27 direction at @xmath51 .    for temperatures below @xmath32 ,",
    "there are two possibilities for @xmath60 and , as a result , we have    @xmath61    but otherwise @xmath62 is complex . after a short inspection we find that @xmath63 is a continuously growing function of @xmath64 on the interval @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "moreover , it equals to zero at @xmath66 and goes to infinity as @xmath67 . the function @xmath68 is , unlike @xmath63 , decreasing .",
    "it goes from its maximum ( finite ) value @xmath69 at @xmath70 to zero at @xmath71 ( on the horizon ) .",
    "thus , the second solution contributes only at distances smaller than @xmath69 . to complete the picture",
    ", we present the plots of @xmath72 in fig.2 .",
    "when temperature is increased , the interval @xmath73 $ ] becomes smaller and finally disappears at @xmath74 . for @xmath75",
    ", a simple analysis leads to the picture that differs noticeably from that of fig.2 .",
    "the point is that both the solutions now contribute only at distances smaller than some finite @xmath76 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "now we move on to the second type that describes disconnected surfaces . in this case",
    "a surface contains two pieces each of which has a topology of a cylinder .",
    "the cylinders are stretched from the polyakov loops on the boundary to the horizon .",
    "if we use @xmath42 and @xmath77 as the world - sheet coordinates , the nambu - goto action is then        @xmath78 where a dot stands for a derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath46 is    @xmath79    it is obvious that it has a trivial solution @xmath80 that represents a straight string stretched between the boundary and the horizon . we will call the choice the solution @xmath81 . since this solution makes the dominant contribution , as seen from the integrand in , we will not dwell on other solutions here .",
    "having discussed the solutions , we can now see what happens with the corresponding areas .",
    "we begin with the solution @xmath82 . to this end , we use the first integral to reduce the integral over @xmath46 to that over @xmath27 in . since the integral is divergent at @xmath34 due to the factor @xmath83 in the background metric , in the process we regularize it by imposing a cutoff @xmath84 . at the end of the day",
    ", we have    @xmath85    subtracting the @xmath86 term we find a finite result    @xmath87+\\frac{c(t)}{t } \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 stands for a normalization constant .    for the second solution @xmath88",
    ", it is a little bit tricky because the minimal surface is built by sewing together two pieces .",
    "the first piece comes from @xmath89 defined on the interval @xmath90 $ ] . at @xmath91 ,",
    "it is sewn with the second piece coming from @xmath88 .",
    "the integral is divergent at @xmath34 , so we regularize it by imposing the cutoff @xmath84 as before . after subtracting the divergency , we get    @xmath92    note that both the areas are regularized in the same way , so the corresponding normalization constants coincide .    for the third solution",
    ", the minimal area can be read off from eq .. one drops the third term as coming from the solution @xmath88 and replaces @xmath93 with @xmath94 in the remaining terms .",
    "the area is then    @xmath95    now let us look at the @xmath96 s as functions of @xmath62 .",
    "we begin with sufficiently low temperature .",
    "since the solution @xmath88 is defined only for distances smaller than @xmath69 , it makes sense to first probe asymptotic behaviors near the point @xmath97 .",
    "a short inspection shows that @xmath98 is not bounded from below , while the others are bounded .",
    "this provides a bit of evidence in favor of dominance of @xmath98 at small distances .",
    "further numerical calculations show that this is indeed the case",
    ". moreover , the first solution turns out to be dominant at physical distances too .",
    "that is of primary importance for phenomenology . ]",
    "we present the plot of the regularized areas in fig.4 .",
    "can be fixed from the slope of the heavy quark potential at zero temperature .",
    "we use the estimate of @xcite @xmath99 , here and below . ]        from this figure it is also clear that there exists a critical distance @xmath100 such that for larger distances @xmath101 becomes dominant .",
    "there is an apparent reason for this . at very large distances",
    "the quark and the anti - quark decouple from each other . usually , instability occurs in models with dynamical quarks , where a string breaks . in the case of interest",
    "this occurs due to emission of closed strings ( glueballs ) .",
    "as known , in ads / qcd a free particle is described by a straight string stretched between the boundary and the horizon that is nothing but our solution @xmath89 .",
    "when temperature is increased , two effects are seen : ( 1 ) the minimal difference between the functions @xmath98 and @xmath102 becomes smaller .",
    "( 2 ) the critical distance @xmath100 is decreasing . for temperatures close to @xmath74 ,",
    "@xmath98 is no longer dominant at physical distances and it is time to account for the other solutions in the series .",
    "in this section we will consider some applications of the developed formalism .",
    "we will focus on the cases where the approximation might be applicable .",
    "we begin with temperatures which are sufficiently smaller than @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the free energy can be evaluated by using with @xmath103 .",
    "first , we need to fix the normalization constant @xmath14 . in doing so ,",
    "we follow @xcite and look for the small @xmath62 expansion of the free energy . since small distances correspond to small deviations in @xmath27 direction , we need to study the expressions and near @xmath66 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath104 is given by    @xmath105    where @xmath106 .",
    "in a similar way we find the behavior of @xmath15 .",
    "it is    @xmath107    combining this with , we get    @xmath108    where @xmath109 and @xmath110 .    having derived the small distance expansion of the free energy , we can now get that of the singlet free energy gauge theory . ]",
    "@xmath111    and compare it with the small distance expansion of the heavy - quark potential at zero temperature . to leading order , we have the same coulomb term as in @xcite . to get an agreement at next - to - leading order , we choose    @xmath112    finally , we fix the value of @xmath113 by matching it to the constant term of the cornell potential @xcite .",
    "this yields    @xmath114    actually , our result shows that at sufficiently small distances the singlet free energy of the pair is temperature independent .",
    "so , the agreement with the lattice data @xcite is very satisfactory at this point .",
    "our next goal is to analyze the long distance behavior of @xmath15 .",
    "as noted in section 2 , large @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "so , we need to study the behavior of and near @xmath116 . in this case",
    "a crucial observation is that the integrals are dominated by the upper limits , where they take the form @xmath117 .",
    "such an integral may be found in @xcite . at the end of the day",
    ", we have    @xmath118    where @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this means that at long distances the free energy of the pair shows the desired confining behavior    @xmath121    with the string tension @xmath122 here @xmath53 denotes a tension at zero temperature .",
    "explicitly , it is given by @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "we have also introduced the critical temperature @xmath124 obtained from the spatial string tension in @xcite .    as expected , the string tension @xmath125 is a decreasing function of t. in fig.5 we have plotted @xmath126 against @xmath127 .",
    "we conclude this subsection by making a few remarks .",
    "( i ) it is quite interesting that the tension shows _ very _ little dependence on temperature up to @xmath128 .",
    "( ii ) unlike the coefficient @xmath125 of the linear term in the large distance expansion of @xmath15 , the coefficient @xmath129 of the linear term in the small distance expansion turns out to be independent of temperature .",
    "( iii ) the free energy of the pair is written in parametric form given by eqs . and .",
    "since we do not know how to eliminate the parameter @xmath64 and find @xmath15 as a function of @xmath62 , we present the result of numerical calculations . in fig.6 the free energy @xmath15 versus @xmath62 for a temperature below @xmath32 is shown .",
    "we have already mentioned that in the literature the entropy contributions are sometimes ignored .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to address this issue .",
    "having understood the behavior of the free energy , we can easily investigate the properties of the entropy .",
    "since the free energy shows no temperature dependence at small distances , it makes sense to focus on long distances , where its behavior is given by . in this case",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to the following expression    @xmath130    here we treat @xmath131 as a function of two variables .",
    "then , using the relations and , we can compute the entropy density of the pair    @xmath132    a closer look at this expression shows that the entropy density grows as the temperature increases .",
    "this is the expected result . to complete the picture",
    ", we plot the entropy density against @xmath127 in fig .",
    "7 .        from this figure",
    ", we see that the entropy density is close to zero up to temperatures of order @xmath133 .",
    "thus , in this temperature range , the entropy contributions are indeed negligible .",
    "it is obvious that the situation changes drastically with the temperature growth .",
    "therefore , a natural question to ask is whether the entropy contributions play a major role at finite temperature . to answer this question , we consider the internal energy of the pair . as usual",
    ", it is given by @xmath134 .",
    "it is clear from above that @xmath135 is independent of temperature at small distances , where it coincides with the heavy - quark potential at zero temperature . at large distances ,",
    "the internal energy has a complex dependence on temperature together with a linear growth with @xmath62 .",
    "explicitly , it is given by    @xmath136    with the tension    @xmath137    the difference with the string tension is due to the second factor that is nothing but the entropy contribution .",
    "a direct but lengthy calculation shows that @xmath138 is a growing function of temperature .",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of the string tension @xmath139 discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "thus , the entropy contributions _ do _ play a major role at finite temperature .",
    "we conclude the discussion with a few short comments : ( i ) a temperature growth of the singlet internal energy at large distances was observed in the lattice calculations of @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the use of thermal ads as the background metric in the low temperature phase results in zero entropy . , so gives zero .",
    "] this leads to the picture that is completely inconsistent with physics of a pure @xmath140 gauge theory at finite temperature . gauge theories . ]",
    "( iii ) in fig.8 we plot @xmath138 versus temperature as provided by the expression .",
    "\\(iv ) it is tempting to see to what extent our predictions for the low temperature behaviors of @xmath139 and @xmath138 are in agreement with the lattice data of @xcite . unfortunately , the lattice data are only available for temperatures close to its critical value .",
    "as noted earlier , at very large separation the quark and anti - quark become free . in this case the dominant exponent is given by @xmath101 .",
    "so , we are in a situation in which the approximation might be applicable .",
    "when we use it to find the expectation value of the polyakov loop , we get    @xmath141    with @xmath101 the minimal area given by . our normalization is stated in and . with this choice",
    ", the polyakov loop expectation value takes the form shown in fig.9 .        certainly , it has the desired behavior : the expectation value of @xmath142 is zero at low temperatures , while it is nonzero at high temperatures .. ] one sees there is a phase transition from the confined phase to the deconfined phase , as expected .",
    "numerically , the transition temperature is of order    @xmath143    this is roughly twice smaller than the value found in @xcite from the spatial string tension .",
    "thus , the numerical consistency is not good enough at this point .",
    "we chose the normalization constant in the form @xmath144 .",
    "the meaning of the coefficients is the following : @xmath145 specifies the value of @xmath142 at @xmath146    @xmath147    @xmath113 specifies the form of @xmath142 .",
    "indeed , the expectation value of the loop is a continuously growing function of temperature for @xmath148 , while it has a local maximum for @xmath149 .",
    "the position of the maximum is given by a solution to equation    @xmath150    for our set of parameters a numerical analysis of results in @xmath151 .",
    "finally , we can compare the temperature dependence of the polyakov loop expectation value as provided by our model with the lattice results of @xcite .",
    "here there is a subtle point .",
    "the lattice data are only available for the range @xmath152 .",
    "this makes it difficult to see what exactly happens in the low temperature phase as well as for high temperatures .",
    "we now fix the normalization by fitting to the data given in table 1 of @xcite near @xmath153 . in fig.10",
    "we have plotted @xmath142 against @xmath154 .",
    "we find that the temperature dependence is in good agreement for @xmath155 .",
    "what we have learned is that the 5-dimensional effective model we proposed to study the properties of a heavy quark - antiquark pair at finite temperature turns out to be remarkably consistent with the qualitative expectations of thermal gauge theory .",
    "moreover , in certain cases it provides the analytic results which are in good agreement with the lattice data .",
    "it is also worth noting that our model predicts the behavior of the thermodynamic quantities for low temperatures where field theory is unreliable and lattice data are missing .",
    "apparently , the model suffers from a lack of numerical self - consistency : the value of the critical temperature as seen from the spatial string tension @xcite turns out to be at least twice bigger than the value we found from the analysis of the polyakov loop in section 3.3 .",
    "there are two lines of thought on this problem .",
    "the first is to account for one - loop corrections in the world - sheet path integral .",
    "this is a complicated problem . indeed",
    ", it is a challenge to theorists to find the world - sheet formulation of string theory on warped geometries like ads spaces . among many things",
    ", it requires world - sheet fermions and even a world - sheet theta angle that is a two - form field @xmath156 with an arbitrary value of @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "but if it was resolved , it could help us to sum the series and hence refine the estimates .",
    "there is another interesting problem here .",
    "what were considered in @xcite are some low temperature corrections to the string tension",
    ". it will be interesting to find similar corrections in our model .",
    "the second line of thought is to somehow modify the background .",
    "it may include a slight revision of the metric or more radical changes like additional background fields .",
    "for instance , a recent proposal of @xcite is even to include the tachyon background .",
    "if a modification is made , it would produce a number of additional free fit parameters that makes it less attractive for phenomenology . to escape the problem , a clever mechanism for reducing the number of parameters must be invented .",
    "part of the interest of ads / cft(qcd ) stems from attempts to understand the physics of rhic .",
    "the reasons are the following : first , a quark - gluon plasma is strongly coupled , so the perturbative qcd is of limited utility .",
    "second , the lattice data do not always provide good information like , for instance on transport properties . on the other hand , ads / cft(qcd )",
    "offers an alternative way of dealing with this real - world problem",

    "<S> in this paper we explore some of the features of a heavy quark - antiquark pair at finite temperature using a five - dimensional framework nowadays known as ads / qcd . we shall show that the resulting behavior is consistent with our qualitative expectations of thermal gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> some of the results are in good agreement with the lattice data that provides additional evidence for the validity of the proposed model . </S>",
