    "the current accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the deepest mysteries in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "this acceleration may be due to some unknown energy - momentum component having the equation of state @xmath1 , or may be due to a modification of general relativity . in this paper , we are interested in the latter possibility .",

    "an early attempt is found , e.g. , in  @xcite , where a modification like @xmath2 was used to explain the accelerated expansion in the _ early _ universe .",

    "for example , the original proposal of  @xcite employs @xmath4 , which admits an acceleratedly expanding solution even in the absence of a dark energy component . in order to accommodate a late time acceleration , however , one must introduce a very low energy scale , @xmath5 ( the present hubble scale ) , leading to a very light scalar field , which predicts the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameter @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , this result contradicts the observational constraint @xmath7  @xcite    to circumvent this difficulty , it is important to notice that the presence of matter may affect the dynamics of the extra scalar degree of freedom .",
    "the key idea is essentially the same as that of the `` chameleon '' model  @xcite , in which the effective mass of the scalar field depends on the local matter density . in particular ,",
    "the scalar field is very light for the cosmological density and is heavy for the solar system density , though the actual mechanism is slightly more complicated .",

    ", a positive curvature singularity corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "taking , for example , @xmath219 , we find that @xmath220 at the de sitter minimum , which is very close to the dangerous curvature singularity ( the result is independent of @xmath216 ) .",
    "since also in this model the effective potential is finite at @xmath221 , we anticipate the same singularity problem .",
    "our choice of the parameters in the present paper gave @xmath208 , for which neutron stars are unlikely to exist .",
    "however , there still remains a possibility that more realistic stellar environments and matter profiles weaken the bound on the potential by a factor of 2 or 3 , and at the same time make the chameleon mechanism work  .",
    "it is technically much more difficult to construct stellar configurations with a realistic equation of state , realistic energy densities , and realistic stellar environments .",
    "such an elaborated modeling of relativistic stars might allow for @xmath222 as large as , say , 0.3 , but the parameter space of the theory will be very restricted . to conclude , @xmath0 theories that reproduce the correct behavior of weak gravity in the solar vicinity do not admit neutron star solutions without special care .",
