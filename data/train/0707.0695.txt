    "indeed the spin and charge degrees of freedom may be strongly intertwined  as seen , for example , in the topological defects , which can simultaneously involve atomic supercurrents and magnetic textures @xcite . the presence of these multiple types of defects leads to a richer variety of phases and phase transitions . in this paper",
    ", we study thermal transitions in @xmath1 polar condensates , where uniaxial spin nematic order ( characterized by a headless vector , or `` director '' ) coexists with superfluidity .",
    "first , we point out a crucial difference between polar condensates with even integer and odd integer spin ( as in @xmath2 @xmath3na ) . for even @xmath0 , the superfluid vortex and the nematic disclination are independent , while for odd @xmath0 they are bound to each other topologically .",
    "this strongly impacts the phase diagrams . when the nematic director is confined to rotate in a plane",
    ", the normal state can be reached via a single continuous transition from the polar state for the case of odd @xmath0 , but not for even @xmath0 , where a split transition is expected .",
    "we study the odd @xmath0 case in detail in this paper , and further show that the single continuous transition itself can take on two very different characters , one , which is essentially kt - like , but with a non - universal superfluid stiffness jump ; and another that is of a new ` cascaded - kt ' type described in more detail below .",
    "interference experiments @xcite which have been used to study kt transitions in scalar condensates , can also be used to probe the new transitions discussed here .    consider spin - one bosons in a 2d optical lattice , described by a hubbard model with couplings @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 the depth of the optical lattice serves to tune @xmath7 . here",

    "here we have introduced the notation @xmath72 to denote the long - distance spin and charge stiffness , which is renormalized by the presence of a finite density of bound defect pairs .",

    ", these regions would be in the nematic and paired superfluid phases ( psf ) , respectively .",

    "[ fig : tvsu],width=3 ]    to obtain the correct phase diagram , however , it is important to recognize that _ the conditions for defect unbinding can not always be treated independently of one another_. in particular , there are situations where the unbinding of one type of defect can precipitate the unbinding of a second type of defect . as an example",
    ", consider the triangular region enclosed by * pqs * in fig .",
    "[ fig : conditions ] . at first glance",
    ", it looks like the superfluid vortices are proliferated ( since @xmath75 ) whereas the disclination+half - vortices remain bound ( since @xmath76 ) . this would identify this region as belonging to the nematic phase .",
    "however , points within this region can not describe a stable nematic phase .",
    "the cheapest defects inside a nematic are the single disclinations",
    " in which the phase @xmath32 winds by @xmath33 .",
    "disclinations are bound whenever the reduced spin stiffness @xmath49 is larger than 4 .",
    "however , @xmath77 in the region * pqs*. therefore , this region is part of the disordered phase .",
    "the instability of the nematic within region * pqs * can also be understood by thinking of the single disclination as the remnant of the disclination+half - vortex of the polar phase , once the superfluid phase has been disordered due to the proliferation of superfluid vortices . in this situation ,",
    "the proliferation of superfluid vortices renormalizes the charge stiffness to zero ( @xmath78 ) . therefore , although the bare values of @xmath50 and @xmath49 satisfy the condition for disclination+half - vortex to be bound , @xmath79 the renormalized stiffnesses do not , @xmath80 these arguments show that , along the line * pq * ( and also along @xmath81 ) , the system undergoes a direct transition from the polar state to the disordered state .",
    "this transition involves two different types of defects , and therefore is in a different universality class from the transition along @xmath82 .",
    "we call the transition along * pq * a `` cascaded kosterlitz - thouless '' transition ( ckt ) .",
    "it is difficult to give a fully controlled renormalization group ( rg ) treatment of the ckt transition , since the physics involves the proliferation of one type of defect before the other defect `` realizes '' that it is unbound .",
    "the conventional rg treatment of defect unbinding is only controlled when the defect fugacities are small , and it breaks down when the defects proliferate and the fugacities become large .",
    "note that , despite the difficulty in giving a carefully controlled rg treatment , the coarse graining process in the rg can not _ increase _ the value of the stiffnesses .",
    "therefore the argument for the instability of nematic order within the region * pqs * is robust . in the following section",

    "( [ eq : cg ] ) , the rg equations must be symmetric under the exchange of spin and charge degrees of freedom .    in order to understand the rg equations ( [ eq : rg ] ) , consider first the flow of the superfluid vortex fugacity @xmath62 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : ktrg ] ) for the flow of @xmath50 describes the screening of the coulomb interaction between defects due to a finite density of bound defect - anti - defect pairs in the medium .",
    "the sign of the flow of @xmath50 is negative semi - definite , and is only zero when the fugacities @xmath62 and @xmath63 are zero , or when @xmath50 itself is zero .",

    "now , the disclination+half - vortices unbind , leading to a completely disordered phase .",
    "we call this a `` cascaded '' kt ( ckt ) transition , since unbinding of one type of defect triggers the unbinding of the other .    both spin - nematic and charge orders have diverging correlation lengths as * pq * is approached from the disordered phase",

    "( [ eq : rg ] ) up to the scale @xmath103 where the superfluid vortex fugacity begins to diverge . at this point ,",
    "the superfluid correlations are explicitly short - ranged , and we can integrate out the charge degrees of freedom to obtain a local spin - only model .",

    "( [ eq : xirat ] ) .",
    "unfortunately we have not measured the correlation lengths directly .",
    "however we can see this divergence in an indirect manner .",
    "since a finite size box limits the diverging correlation lengths , the jumps in the stiffness @xmath141 are no longer sharp but broadened depending on the value of @xmath151 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bffinitesize ] ) .",

    "[ tab : tstar ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ignoring the large values of @xmath194 , we see that @xmath195 at @xmath184 and @xmath196 at @xmath185 .",
    "these must be compared to the theoretical prediction from the rg treatment , @xmath197 .",
    "if we take the curvature in @xmath192 into account by using a fit of the form @xmath198 the @xmath194 improves slightly but is still not good .",

    "if instead we just use the last two points and draw a straight line through the data , this ratio is @xmath203 and @xmath204 respectively .",
    "this large variation in the values of the ratio @xmath199 shows that we do not yet have quantitative control on it .",
    "the theoretical expectation seems to be within the large systematic errors .",
    "since our data are obtained on rather small lattice sizes where the two large length scales @xmath205 can not fit well , our inability to quantitatively control the ratio is not surprising .",

    "in particular we have shown the existence of the disclination+half vortex unbinding transition , which is similar to the kt transition but where the superfluid stiffness jump is non - universal and a cascaded kt transition where in addition to a non - universal jump in the stiffness two correlation lengths diverge at the critical point , where one is a power of the other .",
    "a large scale numerical study supports the detailed picture we have developed .",
    "our analysis can be applied to other ordered states .",
    "for example , spin-2 @xmath206rb in a magnetic field forms a `` square nematic '' state @xcite with @xmath207 .",
    "this yields precisely the same physics as the spin-1 planar polar state .",
    "there are examples outside of cold atomic systems which display the the same topological structure studied here .",

    "_ have argued that the thermal melting of a striped superconducting state is produced by a fully analogous set of topological defects to those discussed here@xcite .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram of a striped superconductor is the same as that of a planar polar condensate , although the particular phases involved in the two cases are different . following this work , a recent numerical study has looked at the @xmath208 version of this system @xcite .",
