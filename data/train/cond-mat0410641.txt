    ", the idea of exploiting the electron spin in electronic devices . while most molecules are normally nonmagnetic , there are exceptions such as endohedral @xmath0i.e . , a nitrogen atom encapsulated in a @xmath1 cage.@xcite it is known that the encapsulated atom retains its @xmath3 electrons,@xcite leading to a localized spin @xmath4",
    ". there are fascinating ideas of employing this spin in a quantum computer.@xcite    in this paper we propose to measure the current through a single @xmath0 molecule in a break junction and we calculate the current - voltage ( _ i - v _ ) characteristics and the differential conductance @xmath5 .",
    "since transport through a single @xmath1 molecule has been demonstrated@xcite and the synthesis of endohedral fullerenes is also feasible,@xcite such an experiment is possible with present - day apparatus . besides the typical coulomb - blockade behavior",
    "we predict a characteristic fine structure of the coulomb - blockade peaks in @xmath5 due to the exchange coupling of the @xmath1 spin to the spin @xmath6 of the encapsulated nitrogen atom .",
    "it should be mentioned that the discussion of transport through @xmath7 proceeds quite analogously and yields qualitatively identical results .",
    "in our model the @xmath0 molecule is treated as a quantum dot and the leads , labeled as l ( left ) and r ( right ) , as macroscopic charge reservoirs .",
    "relaxation in the leads is assumed to be sufficiently fast so that the electron distributions in the leads can be described by fermi functions . as @xmath1 generally prefers to be",
    "singly or doubly negatively charged,@xcite we assume that electronic transport through the molecule involves only the threefold - degenerate lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital).@xcite since we concentrate on the fine structure of the differential conductance close to degeneracy points , we assume that the fivefold - degenerate homo ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) , which lies about @xmath8 below the lumo,@xcite remains fully occupied , whereas the threefold - degenerate lumo+1 , about @xmath9 above the lumo,@xcite remains empty.@xcite charge transfer from the nitrogen atom to the fullerene cage is assumed to be negligible . when the lumo is partially occupied , the net spin of the electrons in the lumo , @xmath10 , couples to the spin @xmath6 of the nitrogen atom , @xmath11 , and the total spin of the molecule is @xmath12 . the exchange interaction can be written in the simple form @xmath13 due to hund s first rule : note that the three lumo s and the three nitrogen @xmath3 orbitals both have odd parity with a single nodal plane each , which can be chosen as the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or @xmath16 plane .",
    "consequently , there is only a significant exchange interaction between any lumo and the @xmath3 orbital of the same symmetry .",
    "the exchange interaction can thus be written as a sum of terms for the three pairs of orbitals . however , due to the strong hunds - rule coupling , the @xmath3 orbital spins combine to @xmath4 ; i.e. , they are all parallel .",
    "then the spin of each @xmath3 orbital is @xmath17 , as can be proved by projecting the spins onto the @xmath4 subspace .",
