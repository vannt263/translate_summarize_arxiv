    "in 2008 , we observed the dusty wolf - rayet ( wr ) star wr118 using the astronomical beam recombiner ( amber , @xcite ) , at the focus of the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) .",
    "wr118 had already been observed using speckle interferometry , on the bta 6 m telescope , in russia ( ) .",
    "the amber visibilities and closure phases were acquired at spatial frequencies up to 5 times larger than the previous speckle observations .",
    "we clearly resolved the system with amber , with visibilities decreasing up to @xmath1 cycles / arc - second , and increasing again above .",
    "such a visibility behavior is typical of an object containing a sharp edge in its intensity distribution .",
    "in addition , the closure phase , measured at three different moments during the night , is clearly non - equal to zero , meaning that wr118 s dusty nebula is asymmetric .",
    "we modelled wr118 s dusty nebula with several geometrical models , including a clumpy spherical wind and a `` pinwheel '' nebula .",
    "this last model provides a physical description of the system and best match the observed data .",
    "therefore , we concluded that wr118 probably hosts a `` pinwheel '' nebula , detected for the first time using long - baseline interferometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "repeating the amber observations on wr118 to confirm its `` pinwheel '' nature is the next step in this research program .",
    "one step forward is to assess the feasibility of imaging such targets with the current and future capabilities of the vlti .    for that , we perform simulations of the current vlti instrument amber ( k - band , 2.2 microns ) and of the second generation planned vlti instrument matisse ( l - band , 3.5 microns ) observations .",
    "we start from the model of wr118 found previously and simulate a realistic observation ( typical v@xmath2 errors of 5% ) with different baselines and one measurement per hour .",
    "then , we use the mira software ( @xcite ) to reconstruct an image of the target from these simulations .",
    "four cases are simulated here :    * amber observations during 3 nights with 3 telescopes configurations , * amber observations during 7 nights with 7 telescopes configurations , * matisse observations during 3 nights with 3 telescopes configurations , * matisse observations during 7 nights with 7 telescopes configurations .    as expected , we find that amber already provides some imaging capabilities , even using as few as three nights of observation",
    ". one can recognize in the reconstructed image all the features from the original image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , as was also experienced on real datasets ( @xcite ) , the relative flux of the different features is not well constrained , because of the lack of 66% of phase information .",
    "increasing , by more than a factor two , the number of nights used , only marginally improves the quality of the image reconstruction .    on the other hand ,",
    "matisse simulations show a better agreement on the fluxes of the different features , even using `` only '' three nights of observation .",
    "we also note that the loss in angular resolution from the k - band and l - band do not apparently affect the quality of the image reconstruction .",
    "we showed here that long - baseline interferometry is now clearly mature to confirm the brightest suspected `` pinwheel '' nebulae , using the current abilities of amber on the vlti .",
    "in addition , we also showed that amber will be able to synthethise an image , where the `` pinwheel '' nebula would be qualitatively recognized , using at least three nights of observing time .",
    "the use of the second generation matisse instrument will permit to have more realistic flux measurements in the different parts of the image , with the same amount of observing time ."
