    "galaxy interactions can strip matter from galaxies , forming tidal debris such as tails , shells and bridges . when the interacting galaxies are fairly isolated , this material tends to fall back onto the parent galaxy .",

    "stars may form loops and shells while the gas may form rotating warped disks , as , for example , in the case of cen a @xcite .",
    "the gas in those features can also form stars , giving rise to structures like tidal dwarf galaxies ",

    "are quickly dispersed by the combination of the cluster tides and ram pressure stripping from the hot intracluster medium , being only partially re - absorbed by the individual systems .",
    "the dispersed matter from the tidal features will , over time , settle onto the cluster potential well and form a very faint intracluster diffuse light component @xcite .",
    "the first mention to intracluster light was by @xcite , to describe an extended envelope of low surface brightness intergalactic matter observed in the coma cluster .",
    "other studies have detected diffuse light envelopes in clusters , such as @xcite , and more recently @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the intracluster light can represent 10 to 50% of the total cluster light , but the measurements have large uncertainties .",
    "in addition , low surface brightness arcs @xcite , individual stars @xcite , novae @xcite and planetary nebulae @xcite are being observed in clusters and share the same origin as the diffuse envelope : stripped material from the cluster galaxies .",
    "the intracluster light offers a direct way to study the dynamical evolution of structures , enabling the study of past galaxy encounters , the dark matter content , history of accretion onto the system and tidal stripping @xcite .",
    "the amount of intracluster light can indicate the evolutionary stage of a system , working as an evolutionary clock , being also sensitive to dark matter distribution , since the shape of the dark matter halo affects the amount of stripped matter .",
    "the presence of substructures such as low surface brightness arcs gives us information about the orbits of the galaxies involved in the interaction episodes .",
    "other unanswered questions such as the origin of the ultra compact dwarf galaxies ",
    "ucds @xcite and the formation mechanism for s0 galaxies @xcite may also be related to the intracluster light .",
    "simulations and theoretical work @xcite have greatly increased our knowledge on the formation of the intracluster light in clusters and groups .",
    "it is still unknown , however , how the specific properties of the intracluster light component correlate with cluster properties , given the large uncertainties involved and the few numbers of studies available in this area .",
    "it is fair to say that we are still in the process of forming a global picture , gathering all information on cluster / group dynamical stages yielded by measurements of intracluster light .",
    "one important addition to the literature data on this area is the determination of the levels of background light in selected compact groups of galaxies .",
    "this is one of the main contributions of this paper .",
    "compact groups of galaxies are very dense environments ( projected densities between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , with low velocity dispersions ( @xmath9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where interactions should be frequent and the stripping of material from the galaxies should be an efficient process . a simple visual inspection of compact groups of galaxies from hickson s catalogue ( hickson compact group catalogue  hcg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that several of them may contain a diffuse background light envelope .",
    "previous studies of compact group galaxies using photographic plates were unsuccessful in detecting the intra - group light component ( igl ) .",
    "@xcite did not detect any diffuse component and @xcite have detected an igl component in only one of the seven groups studied .",
    "a diffuse component was detected by @xcite and @xcite and more recent studies using ccds , @xcite and @xcite , have identified igl in hcg 79 and hcg 90 , which corresponded to 13% and 45% of the total light of the group in the @xmath0 band , respectively . these previous studies measured the background light by modeling the galaxies with elliptical isophotes , removing them from the images and measuring what was left behind .",
    "this poses difficulties first of all because the interacting galaxies are often not well fit by elliptical isophotes and second because the igl , being a very low surface brightness component , usually at a level of less than 1% of the night sky brightness , and being typically distributed over a large area of the group , can be easily contaminated by the light from the group galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we describe a new method to isolate the contribution from the igl in compact groups , the ov_wav @xcite , which uses the _",
    " trous  _ wavelet transform to perform this separation .",
    "this method is independent of galaxy and star modeling and sky level subtraction .",
    "our method is similar to the one recently applied by @xcite to study intracluster light in the coma cluster .",
    "we have applied the method to images of three compact group galaxies : hcg 79 , hcg 88 and hcg 95 . in ",
    "2 we present the observational data .",
    "section 3 presents the data reduction with a brief description of the ov_wav modeling and the tests applied to the data . in ",
    "4 the analysis of the data and the results are presented .",
    "a discussion and summary are presented in section 5 . throughout this work we use @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , when necessary .",
    "we have selected three groups from hickson s catalogue @xcite which seem to be in different evolutionary stages : 1 ) hcg 79 , which contains many signs of galaxy interaction and an igl component which is readily noticeable by eye inspection , 2 ) hcg 88 , with very few signs of interaction , despite its very small 2d velocity dispersion of 31 km s@xmath13 , 3 ) hcg 95 , which presents clear signs of recent interaction such as tails and bridges .",
    "hcg 79 , also known as `` seyfert sextet '' , was originally identified as a sextet of galaxies @xcite and later catalogued by @xcite as a quintet .",
    "the sixth object is in fact a luminous tidal debris .",
    "a decade later , this group was shown to be a quartet with a mean recession velocity of @xmath14 and a discordant recession velocity galaxy at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the group is @xmath16 . at a distance of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , the mean separation of the galaxies",
    "is only @xmath19 .",
    "it is therefore the most compact group in hickson s list @xcite .",
    "the four galaxies present signs of morphological distortions . there are signs of a bar ( hcg 79b ) , tidal tails ( hcg 79b and hcg 79d ) , a dust lane ( hcg 79a ) and emission in radio , infrared , [ nii ] and @xmath20 ( hcg 79a and hcg 79b , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disturbed rotation curves ( hcg 79a and hcg 79b , * ? ? ? * ) and nuclear activity ( hcg 79a , hcg 79b and hcg 79d ) .",
    "signs of the nuclear activity were detected and classified by @xcite using [ nii ] , [ sii ] and @xmath21 ratios .",
    "the group presents a prominent igl envelope , possible to be identified by eye inspection and irregular envelopes of hi @xcite and x - rays @xcite .",
    "these suggest that recent or on - going interaction has taken place within this system .",
    "the group data are summarized in table  [ tabdata ] .",
    "this system is composed by a quartet of late - type galaxies aligned in a filamentary structure , with a mean recession velocity of @xmath22 @xcite and a velocity dispersion of only @xmath23 .",
    "the mean separation of the galaxies is @xmath24 , at a distance of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the group members present some morphological distortions , such as low luminosity extensions ( hcg 88b ) .",
    "they are detected in @xmath21 , infrared and radio emission @xcite but none of the galaxies have highly perturbed rotation curves @xcite .",
    "about 90% of the detected hi content of this group is still associated with the disks of the galaxies @xcite .",

    "promptly notices very obvious morphological peculiarities : two tidal tails in the hcg 95a and hcg 95c region , which seems to connect a and c , and a double nucleus in hcg 95c .",
    "hcg 95c is most probably an on - going merger of two disk galaxies , also in interaction with hcg 95a ( an elliptical galaxy ) .",
    "@xcite noted radio and infrared emission as well as morphological distortions in hcg 95b .",
    "reconstructed iras frames show infrared emission in this group centered on hcg 95c and enclosing the whole group @xcite .",
    "an upper limit to the x - ray detection was given by @xcite using rosat data .",
    "hi was also detected in this group @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected @xmath21 emission in the nuclei of hcg 95a and hcg 95c and in one of the large tidal tails ( the eastern tail ) .",
    "such tail seems to contain a few tidal dwarf galaxies candidates @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 emission was also detected along the hcg 95d edge - on disk .",
    "hcg 95b ( cgcg 406067 ) had @xmath21 emission detected along its disk @xcite , but at a radial velocity of @xmath32 , instead of at the group s velocity .",
    "this indicates that this non - member galaxy is in the foreground of the group . besides the discrepant radial velocity of hcg 95b published by @xcite ( @xmath33 )",
    ", other similarly erroneous values were published at the rc3 ( @xmath34 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "however , a spectrum of this galaxy obtained with the 1.52 meter telescope at eso on november 2002 confirmed the result of @xcite , that its radial velocity is indeed @xmath36 and not around @xmath37 . according to those authors ,",
    "the morphological distortions presented by this galaxy would have been caused by a nearby dwarf galaxy .",

    "we present here a short summary of the results we have obtained , before we proceed with the discussion :    \\(1 ) a new approach was presented for the detection of extended low surface - brightness structures , such as the igl component in compact groups of galaxies , through wavelet analysis , using the ov_wav package .",
    "\\(2 ) we have detected a prominent irregular igl component around hcg 79 , which represents @xmath4% and @xmath38% of the total light of the group in the b and r bands , respectively .",
    "the mean color of the igl in this group is @xmath39 , significantly bluer than the color of the galaxies in the group .",
    "\\(3 ) hcg 95 presents a fainter igl component , representing @xmath5% and @xmath40% of the group s total light in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , respectively , with a mean color @xmath41 .",
    "\\(4 ) the filamentary group hcg 88 presented no igl component , down to the surface brightness detection limit , as expected for a group composed by late - type galaxies with most of its hi still in the galaxies disks .",
    "using the ov_wav package we were able to detect the igl component of compact groups of galaxies , a very difficult task to be performed with the usual algorithms , for which it is necessary to specify the sky brightness levels and the stars / galaxies models .",
    "the usual way to determine the igl component , performed by @xcite for hcg 79 , for an example , is to model the galaxies with stsdas.ellipse and subtract them from the image ( with stsdas.bmodel ) .",
    "then one just measures the remaining light above a chosen sky level , and assign it to the igl component .",
    "another method used , in this case for hcg 90 , was that by @xcite , of isophotal analysis : after sky subtraction , all the light below a certain surface brightness level was considered as igl .",
    "those technics are highly undesirable specially in cases such as those of hcg 79 or hcg 95 , where elliptical models ( fit by stsdas.ellipse ) are a very bad representation for the morphology of the galaxies , and the presence of bright interacting features may increase the isophotal analysis ambiguity . with the ov_wav",
    ", the igl detection could be performed without any `` a priori '' information about the shapes of the galaxies or the sky level .",
    "an evolutionary sequence can be envisioned , for our small sub - sample of compact groups , where hcg 79 is the more evolved group , hcg 95 is in an intermediate stage of evolution and hcg 88 is a group that has just started its evolution as a group .",
    "we give details of each group below .",
    "the igl component detected in hcg 79 , a group which show several indications of been `` about to collapse '' in a single structure , or at an advanced evolutionary stage , has a light envelope with irregular form which takes up about one third to half the total group light .",
    "such a high contribution from the igl component is in contrast with the value of 13% found by @xcite , for the same group , from independent @xmath42 and @xmath43-band data , although the morphology of the igl was found to be very similar .",
    "the disagreement probably comes from the technic differences described above .",
    "we can notice in figure  [ figdifh79 ] a strong light concentration to the northwest , opposite to the tidal debris located to the northeast , which could have being generated in the same interaction process , like symmetrical tidal tails , but with a smaller amount of mass .",
    "the irregular shape of the igl may be an indication that the group potential is not relaxed in an spherical shape .",
    "on the other hand , the amount of light in the igl component of hcg 79 suggests that the group has probably already been in a compact configuration for some time .",
    "the x - rays halo observed with rosat by @xcite ( in a 3@xmath3 level ) , is spatially coincident with the igl component , indicating that this is following the gravitational potential and it is tracing the dark matter halo of the group .",
    "the hi of the group is concentrated in two clouds , one in the southern part , below the only late - type galaxy ( hcg 79d ) , and one in the region of the northeastern tidal debris .",
    "these were probably a result of an interaction of this late - type galaxy with the group halo @xcite .    according to @xcite this group presents on one hand signs of high dynamical evolution , specially in the optical , since tidal structures in broad band optical images are clearly seen , and signs of almost no evolution , on the hi content , which is basically associated to the disk of the only late - type galaxy ( hcg 79d ) , which leads to the absence of interaction triggered star formation .",
    "the star clusters found in @xcite are red and even though they may have been formed during interaction processes , they are old clusters ( @xmath44 to @xmath45 yr ) .",
    "no tidal dwarf galaxies and just a few dwarfs were detected .",
    "@xcite classified this group as being at an intermediate stage of evolution ( they used the expression `` beginning of the end '' to describe the evolutionary stage of this group ) .",
    "this classification also agrees with the findings of @xcite , who used a relation between group velocity dispersion and galaxy activity .",
    "an igl component of this group is mentioned as an optical evidence of dynamical evolution , and our high fraction of igl indicates that this group is really half way to collapse or a step further .",
    "the mean color of the galaxies in hcg 79 is consistent with the expected old stellar population of a group dominated by early - type galaxies , while the igl component is significantly bluer .",
    "the blue color of the igl in hcg 79 is inconsistent with the observations and simulations for galaxy clusters @xcite and even for higher redshifts studies as @xcite at @xmath46 in the sdss clusters .",
    "the stellar populations which constitute the diffuse light could have been partially stripped from the outer parts of the group galaxies , during interaction processes , as the bright tidal debris described before and partially due to the destruction of dwarf galaxies with bluer colors than the giant group members .",
    "the destruction of dwarf galaxies by the group tidal field is one of the possible mechanisms of formation of the bimodal globular cluster population usually found in early - type galaxies and may contribute to the igl component as well @xcite .",
    "no blue dwarf galaxy was detected in this group by @xcite .",
    "blue diffuse regions were detected by @xcite in the coma cluster , where spiral galaxies were disrupted or harassed , leading to infall of star - forming material to the cluster potential .",
    "the fraction of light in the igl component of hcg 79 is @xmath47 , at the groups distance , which corresponds to a galaxy twice as large as hcg 79a , the brightest group galaxy .",
    "tidal stripping of the galaxies outer parts is the most probable explanation for the small size of those galaxies , about a third of the size of a normal disk galaxy @xcite .",
    "hcg 95 presents a nearly spherical igl component centered on hcg 95a .",
    "this group shows several tidal features indicating clear interaction and has an igl component which corresponds to about 10% of the total light of the group .",
    "this is most probably formed by the stripping of material from the interacting galaxies .",
    "this group was detected in x - rays by rosat @xcite with a flux upper limit of @xmath48 , indicating a shallow potential well , typical of spiral - dominated groups and was also detected in infrared by iras , with emission centered on hcg 95c and enclosing the whole group @xcite .",
    "hcg 95c1 and c2 , hcg 95d and two previously unknown dwarf galaxies were detected in hi .",
    "in addition , radio continuum emission was searched for within a field of 9 arcminutes around the group and hcg 95c ( centered on c1 ) was detected as a continuum source @xcite .",
    "hcg 95 presents clear signs of interactions as tidal tails and bridges , @xmath21 emission and tdg candidates on the main tidal tail @xcite .",
    "the interaction system ( hcg 95a / c ) , which is indeed formed by three galaxies ( an elliptical , hcg 95a , and two disk galaxies , hcg 95c1 and c2 ) giving rise to the complex arrangement of tidal tails observed in this group , was studied by @xcite and two models were proposed .",
    "the first one suggests that the two disk galaxies ( c1 and c2 ) are in on - going interaction and this pair interacts with the elliptical galaxy .",
    "the second scenario puts forward that the two disk galaxies interact independently with the elliptical galaxy in different times , generating a pair of tails each and are projected over each other ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more complete description of the models ) .",
    "the on - going interactions suggest that this group is young , or entering an intermediate stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "@xcite , found unusual color and patches of dust in the elliptical galaxy , which together with the @xmath21 emission would be a sign of mass transfer among the galaxies through the tidal tails .",
    "the authors argue that those effects where indicating that this interacting system would probably merge in a few orbital periods .",
    "the detected igl component has a magnitude of @xmath49 , which is about one third of the total luminosity of hcg 95a .",
    "this result gives support to the scenario that puts forward that this group is in an intermediate evolutionary stage , since the igl component has most probably been created by the interaction of hcg 95a / c .",
    "no extension of the igl was detected towards the discordant galaxy hcg 95b , an additional indication that this galaxy does not belong to the group .",
    "no igl component was detected for hcg 88 down to the surface brightness detection limit of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this result supports the scenario of hcg 88 being a filamentary system which has just initiated its evolution .",
    "further support to this scenario comes from the hi observations for the group galaxies : all four late - type galaxies of the group still contain 90% of the hi attached to their disks @xcite suggesting this is a group that has been together for a short time .",
    "the very low velocity dispersion of this group , @xmath23 , lower than the expected for a virialized structure with the group characteristics , was used by @xcite to argue that this group would be a chance alignment of galaxies in a turnaround point .",
    "this group was also pointed out as a good candidate for @xcite projected filamentary groups .    on the other hand , according to @xcite , a group with a filamentary structure such as hcg 88 , with very low velocity dispersion and short crossing time ( very different from the predicted from * ? ? ?",
    "* simulations ) , with a high fraction of hi associated to the galaxy disks and very isolated ( there are only two galaxies , about 3 magnitudes fainter than the faintest giant member galaxy , hcg 88d , in a 700 kpc - side square centered on the group , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is very improbable to be a chance alignment .",
    "our conclusion that the group is in an initial evolutionary stage agrees with the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dynamical friction could also be responsible for low observed group velocity dispersion , but it would only be expected in a group in advanced stage of collapse , which does not seem to be the case here .      no significant relations between the structure size and the intra - group or intracluster light fraction were found .",
    "the literature points to values ranging from 16 to 28% for clusters with richness 2 @xcite , 13% for a cluster with richness 3 @xcite , an average of 11% for clusters at @xmath52 @xcite , 17 to 43% in virgo , depending on the studied region @xcite and 50% in coma @xcite .",
    "the fraction of igl found for hcg 79 is a high value .",
    "it is interesting to note that the values for clusters may include the light of several galaxies which are not in reality involved in the interaction processes that generate the intracluster component , but in compact groups , in particular for hcg 79 , all the member galaxies seem to be somehow involved in the interactions .",
    "we could recalculate the @xmath53 for hcg 79 and hcg 95 , estimated by @xcite , correcting the luminous component by the igl detected in this work .",
    "however , these measurements are very uncertain given that the only mass determinations available for these groups are from the spectroscopy of a few member galaxies @xcite . therefore , any attempt to find correlations between mass , or @xmath53 , and the igl fraction would be speculative at this point .",
    "@xcite point out a possible relation where shorter group crossing times would indicate a more evolved stage , estimated by the spiral fraction and the magnitude difference between the first and the second ranked galaxies ( @xmath54 ) . taking the igl fraction as a dynamical evolution indicator ,",
    "the groups studied here do follow the same trend , however without any statistical significance given the size of our sample ( three groups ) .",
    "hcg 79 has a crossing time of @xmath55 and an igl fraction of @xmath4% , hcg 95 has a crossing time of @xmath56 and an igl fraction of @xmath5% and hcg 88 has a crossing time of @xmath57 and no igl detection .",
    "the study of the relations between the igl characteristics and the group environment will be addressed in a forthcoming paper when a statistically significant sample can be studied .    in conclusion , with the presently studied sample we could define an evolutionary sequence , in which hcg 79 is the more evolved , in an about - to - collapse stage ; hcg 95 is an intermediate to young group in this sequence ; and finally hcg 88 is the least evolved of the groups , which has just started its dynamical evolution .",
