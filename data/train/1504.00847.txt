    "in the landmark papers by foschini and gans @xcite and by telatar @xcite the great promise of the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas was presented and established . the importance of such multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) links is based on the fact that parallel data streams emanating from different transmit antennas can be decoded simultaneously from the receive array , thus making the throughput scale linearly with the number of transmit antennas .",
    "this scaling property is important in the quest to meet the expected thousand - fold increase of wireless network capacity in the coming years@xcite . at the same time , the necessary transmit power per data stream is reduced by the same factor , thus also addressing energy - related pollution issues , which are becoming major societal and economical concerns @xcite .",
    "in fact , so - called _ massive _ mimo systems of a few hundred antenna arrays @xcite have been identified as a key enabling technology for the next generation 5 g wireless networks @xcite , promising unprecedented data transfer increases .    in this paper , we address the calculation of shannon s mutual information of mimo channels under some general assumptions on the channel statistics who have been considered only partially in the literature . to start with",

    "a third component of the channel model is related with the so - called ricean ( or `` deterministic '' ) part , due to _ e.g. _  a line of sight or a specular component . in this work ,",
