    "galaxies and other extragalactic sources provide the most direct means of studying evolution in the universe .",
    "this is done using the classic cosmological tests such as the angular diameter - redshift - magnitude relations or the source counts ( also known as the log@xmath0-log@xmath1 ) test .",
    "( for a general description of these tests see , e.g. weinberg 1972 . ) these tests , which rely primarily on the distribution of the magnitudes or fluxes of the sources , have had limited success in determining the cosmological parameters and/or the evolution of galaxies .",
    "there are two fundamental reasons for this failure .",
    "the first is the well - known difficulty of disentangling the evolution of the sources ( see e.g. tinsley 1968 or tinsley & gunn 1976 ) from the evolution of the universe ( weinberg 1972 ) . as a result , over the years",
    ", the focus of such studies has been shifted from the determination of the cosmological parameters to the evolution of galaxies in different assumed cosmological models .",
    "the second difficulty arises from the fact that galaxies are extended ( i.e. resolved ) sources and there is ambiguity in defining proper magnitudes ( or luminosities @xmath2 and fluxes @xmath3 ) and diameters .",
    "in addition the samples of sources are not merely limited by their fluxes ( or magnitudes ) but there exist other selection biases or data truncations due to surface brightness or size limitations .",
    "these aspects of the problem are usually ignored .",
    "this may be an acceptable approximation for high surface brightness sources at low redshifts , but it is woefully inadequate when dealing with data at high redshifts extending to low surface brightness sources .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present a proper analysis of the various observational biases that are encountered in this process .",
    "there are two ways one can carry out this task . from the original data sample one can select a subsample with fewer and simpler biases ( as we do in  * 3 * ) , or one may correct the model expectation fully for all known selection biases , which is the approach we take in the rest of the paper .",
    "the first method is more appropriate for tests dealing with the moments of the distributions such as flux - redshift or size - redshift relations .",
    "the second method is preferable when dealing with the various source counts and uses all of the valuable data .    the bias due to the magnitude or flux limit is accounted for by various means . the most common practice is to use _ isophotal _ values , i.e. the values of these quantities up to or at some limiting apparent surface brightness @xmath4 .",
    "however , because of the rapid decline of the apparent surface brightness @xmath5 ( defined as flux per unit angular area of a resolved source ) with redshift @xmath6 ( see , e.g. tolman 1934 ) , [ basic ] b = b/4 , where @xmath7 is the intensity or the absolute surface brightness at the source , the biases due to the surface brightness and size limits of the observations become important at high redshifts and/or for low surface brightness sources .",
    "these effects are often ignored or are dealt with indirectly by using a limited portion of the available data .",
    "the corrections required for these effects , sometimes referred to as aperture corrections , inevitably require the knowledge of the surface brightness profile [ profile ] b(r)=b_0f(r",
    "/ r_0 )  with   f(0)=1 , and the distributions of the central surface brightness @xmath8 , the characteristic or core radius @xmath9 , and other parameters @xmath10 defining the profile @xmath11 .",
    "for example , @xmath12 for disks or spheroids , respectively , where the profile is described by the simple relation @xmath13 .",
    "early examples of methods to correct the redshift magnitude relation for the aperture effect were described by sandage ( 1972 ) , using an iterative procedure , and by gunn & oak ( 1975 ) , assuming a fiducial cosmological model .",
    "these authors used empirical relations for the luminosity within the radius @xmath14 , [ lumin ] l(r)=(4)r_0 ^ 2b_0f(r / r_0 )  with   f(t)=_0^t 2xf(x)dx .",
    "it was shown by petrosian ( 1976 ) ( p76 hereafter ) that these corrections can be carried out more directly .",
    "it was also shown in p76 that one can separate the evolution of the surface brightness @xmath8 from the evolution of universe , and can avoid some of the above difficulties by dealing with the angular sizes and magnitudes up to and within a `` proper metric '' radius @xmath15 obtained from a specified value of the quantity [ eta ] = f(x ) = 2 dlnr  with  x = rr_0 , which is equal to the ratio of the average  within @xmath14 to the  at @xmath14 .",
    "the above equations describe the source brightness profile and its basic properties in terms of two convenient parameters ; the central  @xmath8 and core radius @xmath9 .",
    "these parameters are not easily accessible to observations and their relative values for different values of @xmath16 are difficult to interpret .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome if we transfer the above relations to observationally more meaningful parameters .",
    "one commonly used such sets of parameters is the effective radius and .",
    "the effective values refer to the radius containing half the total luminosity @xmath2 which means @xmath17",
    ". the ratios of the effective to central values are : @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 and 1/4 , respectively .",
    "figure [ profiles ] shows the profile @xmath23 , the curves of growth of luminosity @xmath24 and the function @xmath25 as a function of @xmath26 , for the above values of @xmath16 .",
    "this shows the general and relative characteristics of these functions .    to demonstrate the effects of the redshift , in figure [ fandavsz ] we show the variation with redshift of the fraction of the luminosity and the area ( expressed in magnitude units ) within a  limit @xmath5 for @xmath27 and 1/4 profiles . instead of the surface brightnesses @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath5 we use the more familiar magnitudes ; @xmath28 const . , and @xmath29 const .. as evident the observable area and luminosity vary rapidly with redshift , specially for low surface brightnesses and have a different behavior for the two profiles . this will produce a variation with redshift of the relative abundances of disks and spheroids .",
    "another possible representation of the above graphs will be in terms of the proper metric radius @xmath15 defined above .",
    "this is preferable because this definition of radius relies on the data within some measured isophot and not on the unobserved outer parts which are needed to determine the effective radius @xmath30 .",
    "this procedure will be developed further in  * 3*.    in this paper we review several old procedures and propose some new ones for the study of the evolution of galaxies , and possibly that of the universe , whereby instead of dealing with individual galaxies we deal with the combined brightness of all galaxies .",
    "the new methods simplify the data analysis enormously and are perfectly suited for modern digitized data . in ",
    "2 we first give a brief description of the proper analysis of the classical tests for isophotal quantities that includes all the observational selection effects as well as the effects of the surface brightness profile , and treats the problem in terms of the multivariate distribution @xmath31 instead of the commonly used luminosity function @xmath32 .",
    "there are several reasons for the popularity of the latter procedure .",
    "the first is that we have accumulated a considerable knowledge about the local luminosity function of galaxies ( see e.g. efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 and lin et al . 1966 ) but little information on the distributions of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see , e.g. sandage & perelmuter , 1991 ) . secondly ,",
    "until recently it was believed that that the distribution of the surface brightness was fairly narrow ( fish , 1964 ; freeman , 1970 ) . however , in recent years , because of increasing interest in low surface brightness dwarf galaxies , some data has been accumulated on the intrinsic distributions of these parameters indicating broad distributions ( see e.g. mcgaugh 1996 ; de jong 1996 ; tully & verheijen 1997 ; impey & bothun 1997 and references cited there ) .",
    "of course , one can use the luminosity function by replacing the total luminosity @xmath33 [ see eq .",
    "( [ lumin ] ) ] for either @xmath8 or @xmath9 . in any case a multivariate description is required . in ",
    "3 we repeat the analysis of  2 for metric quantities . in ",
    "4 we describe the new tests and their relations to the multivariate distribution @xmath34 and the profile @xmath35 .",
    "finally , in  5 we give a brief summary .",
    "the classical test use the observed relations between the magnitude ( or flux @xmath3 ) , angular size ( radius @xmath36 or area @xmath37 ) and redshift to determine the cosmological parameters and the evolution of sources as described by the general `` luminosity '' function @xmath34 .",
    "the cosmology is introduced via the relations [ ltheta ] l()=(4)r_0 ^ 2b_0f(r)/(4d_l^2(z , _",
    "i ) )   and  = r / d_a(z , _",
    "i ) , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the luminosity and the angular diameter distances , and @xmath40 represent the cosmological parameters such as the density parameter @xmath41 , the deceleration parameter @xmath42 or the cosmological constant @xmath43 ( see , e.g. weinberg 1972 ) .",
    "all the classical tests can be described in terms of the observed distribution of flux , size and redshift ; @xmath44 . for the purpose of the demonstration of the effects that we would like to emphasize here ,",
    "let us consider the cumulative source counts as a function of redshift , which we denote by @xmath45 .",
    "the cumulative and differential counts of the so called log@xmath0-log@xmath1 relation is obtained by the integration of the above expressions over the redshift .    for simplicity , in the above relation and in what follows ,",
    "we ignore cosmological attenuation , if any , assume either bolometric ( or monochromatic ) fluxes , so that we can ignore the k - correction , and assume spherical symmetry with brightness profile @xmath35 independent of the wavelength .",
    "the complications due to k - correction , asphericity , etc . can be easily included in the relations that follow .",
    "we will address some aspects of these in  5 .      the usual practice ( see , e.g. metcalfe et al .",
    "1995 or tyson , 1988 ) is to compare the observed cumulative and differential distributions @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( and their integrals over redshift ) with that expected from models via the relations [ npoint ] = dvdz _ ^(l , z)dl   and  = dvdz 4 d_l^2(,z ) , where @xmath48 is the co - moving volume up to redshift @xmath6 and @xmath49 is the co - moving density of all sources at @xmath6 . here and in what follows",
    "we assume a complete @xmath50 sterradian sky coverage .",
    "these expressions is what one would expect for unresolved or point sources , where only the flux limit counts in the selection process ( see , however , a modification below in  * 2.3 * ) .      for extended sources such as galaxies the selection process is more complex and additional corrections are required .",
    "we now describe these selection biases .",
    "a source to be detected must have an apparent central  exceeding the detection threshold which must be several times the standard deviation @xmath51 of the fluctuations in the background brightness .",
    "we denote this limit by @xmath4 . if we ignore the image degradation due to the finite size of the instrumental and atmospheric point spread function ( psf ) , which can be done if the core size @xmath52 , and if the pixel size is less than or comparable to the width @xmath53 of the psf , then the surface brightness selection criterion requires that [ biso ] b_0 4 .",
    "however , for small sources or high redshifts the effect of the finite size of the psf can not be ignored and the selection bias is more severe than indicated by this relation . for a psf@xmath54",
    "the surface brightness is modified to [ psfpr ] b ( r)=b_0f ( r / r_0 , _ s d_a / r_0 ) ,  where  f = f*g is the convolution of the the actual profile with the psf . as a result",
    ", the central surface brightness is reduced by @xmath55 , where [ psfb ] ( _ s d_a / r_0)=_0^f(d_a / r_0)g(/_s ) d/ _ 0^g(/_s ) d. for the purpose of illustration let us consider a box psf with the radial width of @xmath53 .",
    "this reduction factor then simplifies and equation ( [ biso ] ) is modified to read [ b1 ] b_0 x_s^2/f(x_s )  with  x_s=_s d_a / r_0 .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for other forms of the psf .",
    "for @xmath56 this reduces to equation ( [ biso ] ) but its effects become important for @xmath57 near unity i.e. for partially resolved and unresolved sources .",
    "note that @xmath58 is replaced by the pixel size @xmath59",
    "if @xmath60      another criterion for selection of extended sources such as galaxies is that their sizes must exceed some limit .",
    "one way to quantify this is to have the isophotal angular radius ( namely , the radius where the   has dropped to the specified isophotal value @xmath4 ) be larger than some specified size @xmath36 . if @xmath61 , then the isophotal angular radius is given by [ tiso ] = ( r_0/d_a)f^-1(/b_0 ) , where the function @xmath62 is the inverse of the profile function @xmath23",
    ". then the selection condition @xmath63 is satisfied if [ b2 ] b_0 /f(d_a / r_0 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath64 decreases toward @xmath58 one should use the modified profile @xmath65 of equation ( [ psfpr ] ) in place of @xmath23 . in any case",
    ", it is clear that for @xmath66 this inequality will provide a more restrictive limit than the  limit because it requires that more than one pixel to exceed the  limit @xmath4 .",
    "this can be demonstrated mathematically also by setting @xmath67 in the last equation and comparing it with the limit in equation ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the two limits is equal to @xmath68 which according to equation ( [ eta ] ) is greater than one , except for the unlikely event of the  increasing with @xmath14 . in the opposite case when @xmath69 one is dealing with unresolved or point like sources in which case a size limit",
    "does not make sense .    for non - spherical sources we can follow a similar procedure by dealing with the isophotal angular area @xmath70 ( which for spherical sources is equal to @xmath71 ) as the area of the sources with apparent   @xmath72 .",
    "however , the relation of this to the surface brightness profile will be more complicated .",
    "for example , for elliptical sources with a constant ellipticity we can express the profile @xmath23 as a function of the area @xmath73 with @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the core radii along the major and minor axes . for randomly oriented elliptical sources this will amount to replacement of the quantity @xmath77 in  ( [ b2 ] ) by @xmath78 the distribution function @xmath34 now",
    "will be a function of @xmath79 and the ellipticity or the ratio @xmath80 .",
    "finally the sample of sources is subject to a flux limit . in this section",
    "we consider the flux @xmath81 within the isophotal angular radius @xmath82 or up to the  limit @xmath4 .",
    "the flux limit then implies that @xmath83 is greater than some specified flux @xmath3 . using equations ( [ lumin ] ) and ( [ ltheta ] )",
    "we can write this limit as [ b3 ] b_0f()d^2_l l/(r_0 ^ 2 )  with   d_a / r_0=f^-1(/b_0 ) .",
    "note that the left hand side of this inequality is independent of @xmath9 . however ,",
    "if @xmath84 , then one should replace the profiles @xmath23 and its integral the luminosity growth curve @xmath85 by the corresponding values , @xmath65 and @xmath86 , modified by the psf . in this case the above relation becomes more complex with the involvement of the additional variable @xmath87 ( see  * 2.4 * below ) .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath88 and @xmath58 the above three inequalities determine the region of the @xmath89 plane that is accessible at these particular conditions .",
    "this region varies with redshift becoming smaller at higher redshifts .",
    "the redshift dependences are hidden in @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "figure [ b0r0 ] show the three boundary conditions obtained by the equality sign in equations ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) for the exponential , @xmath92 , and de vaucouleurs , @xmath93 , profiles .",
    "we plot @xmath94 versus @xmath95 , which is valid at all redshifts .",
    "the lowest ( heavy ) solid line shows the truncation due to the  limit .",
    "the lighter solid lines show the effects of the size limit for several values of @xmath96 .",
    "the dashed lines show the truncation due to the flux limit for different values of the ratio @xmath97 .",
    "sources lying in the region above all three lines are the ones which satisfy all the selection criteria .",
    "it is clear that , as long as @xmath98 , or @xmath99 , which obviously will be the case for resolved sources , the surface brightness limit due to the psf , described by equation ( [ b1 ] ) , is never important .",
    "however , both size and flux limits could be important depending on the relative values of the observational limits . for larger values of the ratio @xmath100 the flux limit",
    "provides the major constraint . in the opposite case",
    "the size limit becomes more important , and as evident from the above figures for @xmath101 only the size limit is relevant .",
    "we can now relate the observable @xmath45 to the distribution function @xmath102 by the integration of the latter over the accessible region as determined by the observational limits . for the general case this gives [ next ] = dvdz(^b_0,cr _ db_0 ^_r_0,1 dr_0 ( b_0,r_0,z ) + ^_b_0,cr db_0 ^_r_0,2 dr_0 ( b_0,r_0,z ) ) . here",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 are obtained by solving equations ( [ b3 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) for @xmath9 in terms of @xmath8 and other observables , and [ bcr ] b_0,cr= /f ( ^-1(l/(^2 ) ) ) , is the intersection point of the the two boundary conditions described by equations ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) or the intersection of a solid and a dashed line in figure [ b0r0 ] ; @xmath105 is the inverse function of the function @xmath25 defined in equation ( [ eta ] ) . note that as stated above for @xmath101 this critical value of  becomes equal to @xmath90 , the first double integral in the left hand side of  ( [ next ] ) vanishes and we are left with the size limited part of this expression only .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that the relation for the counts of extended sources is considerably more complicated than the commonly used relation ( [ npoint ] ) . in order to see these differences",
    "more clearly we can rewrite the above expressions in terms of the luminosity @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if we replace @xmath9 by @xmath106 we can rewrite all the boundary conditions in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath2 instead of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the three limits in equations ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) now give , respectively , the conditions [ b1 ] b_0 ( f^-1())^2/ ,   with   = 4d_l^2(_s^2 ) f()/l , [ b2 ] l l_min , 4d_l^2(^2 ) f()/(^2f ( ) ) , and [ b3 ] l l_min , l f()/f ( ) . here",
    "@xmath107 is the inverse function of the luminosity curve of growth @xmath85 and @xmath108 is a function of @xmath94 ( eq . [ [ b3 ] ] ) .",
    "figure [ b0l ] shows the truncations produced by the above selection criteria in the @xmath109 plane .",
    "if we define the distribution @xmath110 , equation ( [ next ] ) then becomes [ next ] = dvdz ( ^b_0,cr _ db_0 ^_l_min , l dl |(b_0,l , z ) + ^_b_0,cr db_0 ^_l_min , dl     so far we have expressed our results in terms of the central  @xmath8 and core radius @xmath9 . as mentioned in ",
    "1 these parameters are not convenient for compring the results with observations .",
    "this task can be carried out more readily if we express the above relations in terms of observationally more meaningful parameters such as the effective radius and  defined in  1 . in figure [ b0ll ]",
    "we show the size and flux limits in the -luminosity plane for both profiles , where instead of the surface brightnesses @xmath4 and @xmath8 we use the more familiar magnitudes ; @xmath111  const . , and @xmath112  const ..",
    "this figure demonstrates that the region of @xmath109 plane accessible to observations is different for the two profiles and shrinks with increasing redshift .",
    "there are several ways that this correct description differs from the approximate expression given by  ( [ npoint ] ) .",
    "some of these were discussed by yoshii ( 1993 ) .",
    "the first difference is the existence of the second set of integrals in  ( [ next ] ) and ( [ next ] ) which we discussed above . even at high values of the flux limit , @xmath113 , when this additional term is negligible there are two other important differences .",
    "the first is due to the presence of the ratio @xmath114 in the lower limit of the luminosity @xmath115 , which is absent from the lower limit in  ( [ npoint ] ) .",
    "the second effect is due to the breadth of the distribution of @xmath8 . for narrower distributions",
    "this effect is smaller and disappears for a delta function distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "these differences can be seen in figures 4a and 4b as follows . for a given value of @xmath3 or the ratio @xmath116",
    "the point source approximation given by equation ( [ npoint ] ) truncates the @xmath109 plane by a vertical line at the asympthote of dashed line appropriate for this ratio",
    ". then counts all the sources to the right of this line ( @xmath117 ) , irrespective of their surface brightness @xmath8 , and uses @xmath118 .",
    "equation ( [ next ] ) , on the other hand , indicates that this is an overestimation of the counts and that we should count only sources which lie to the right of both a solid and a dashed lines appropriate for the ratios @xmath96 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that ignoring the  and size limitations can cause significant errors the extent of which can be quantified only if we know the distribution function @xmath119 .",
    "we have a good knowledge of the dependence of @xmath119 on @xmath2 at low @xmath6 and high @xmath8 but we have only scanty information on its form at high @xmath6 and low values of @xmath8 .",
    "the primary aim of the cosmological tests under the discussion here is to determine the variation with redshift of the general distribution function @xmath119",
    ". a detailed investigation of these aspects are beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we make some simple comparisons between the extended and point source results which do not require a knowledge of the distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "limits_. the ratio of the limiting luminosities @xmath120 and/or @xmath121 to the limit @xmath122 of the point source approximation , which depends only on the surface profile , are shown in figure [ lmins ] , for @xmath92 and 1/4 , respectively , and for several values of the  ( actually the ratio @xmath94 ) and the ratio @xmath123 .",
    "we use the effective rather the central  and express the above ratios in magnitudes . as evident for high values of the ratio @xmath124 , i.e. for higher flux limits",
    ", there is an increasing bias against detection of extended sources at higher redshifts . at lower values of this ratio",
    "there is additional bias against detection of galaxies at low redshifts due to the size limit .",
    "2)_redshift distributions_. these differences can also be seen when we compare the redshift distributions expected for point and extended sources . for the purpose of illustration",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 and @xmath8 are uncorrelated ( clearly not a good assumption ) so that we can separate the distribution function as @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 describe the density and luminosity evolution of the sources , and @xmath128 gives the distributions of the central surface brightness . if we define the cumulative functions @xmath129 and @xmath130 , with @xmath131 , then equations ( [ npoint ] ) and ( [ next ] ) become , respectively [ np ] = dv dz ( z)(/l^ * ) and [ ne ] = dv dz ( z)(_^b_0,cr h(b_0)(/l^*)db_0 + _ b_0,cr^ h(b_0)(/l^*)db_0 ) . in absence of an exact knowledge of the distribution @xmath128",

    "the results are shown in figure [ nofz ] for @xmath136 , and for a cosmological model with @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we also assume absence of any density or luminosity evolutions ; @xmath139 and @xmath140 constants .    it should be noted that the relative shapes of the point source and various extended source distributions are independent of the cosmological model or the density evolution @xmath141 . as evident equation ( [ npoint ] ) or ( [ np ] ) give quite incorrect redshift dependences , overestimating the number of sources by a large factor at high redshifts , specially for low values of the  due to the  limit , and at high values of  due to the size limit .",
    "clearly ignoring these effects could lead to incorrect results .",
    "for example , if these expressions were used to derive the extent of the luminosity evolution , @xmath142 , they would underestimate this evolution by factors equal to @xmath143 and @xmath144 , depending whether @xmath145 or is equal to 1 , respectively .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the effects of the dispersion of the  or its correlation with the luminosity ( or core size @xmath9 ) are included . in such cases",
    "there would be errors in the determination of the density evolution as well .",
    "3)_source counts .",

    "figure [ diffc ] shows the differential magnitude counts of extended sources with various values of as well as that of point sources .",
    "we use the same model parameters as above . again , as evident the neglect of the selection aspect discussed above can cause considerable error in the determination of the evolution of the general luminosity function or the cosmological parameters .      it should be noted that some of these effects are present even for unresolved or point sources . however , in this case the correct equation is only slightly different than  ( [ npoint ] ) or ( [ np ] ) .",
    "when @xmath147 the sources are unresolved and they all have essentially the same profile @xmath148 and size @xmath58 as the psf ; @xmath149 .",

    "@xmath159 is the inverse function of the psf .",

    "the  limit can be important for unresolved galaxies because of their low intrinsic  or effective temperatures .",
    "but for other point sources such as quasars whose  is equal to that of a hot accretion disk this effect is negligible ( becoming important only at extremely high redshifts ) and the point source approximation of  ( [ npoint ] ) is very accurate .      in principle we can combine the counts of the resolved and unresolved sources by replacement of the @xmath162 with the modified profile @xmath163 of  ( [ psfpr ] ) .",
    "we can then repeat the procedure carried out for the extended sources with the replacement of the profiles @xmath23 and @xmath85 with @xmath65 and @xmath86 and change the limits correspondingly , except now the profiles are functions of the additional parameter @xmath164 . however , now the size limit is unnecessary because we can include all sources .",
    "of course one must make sure that the sample of galaxies , for example , is not contaminated by other unresolved sources ( e. g. stars ) .",
    "we therefore have the simpler expression [ nall ] = dvdz ^ _ db_0 ^_l_min , l dl |(b_0,l , z ) , where @xmath165 is given by  ( [ b3 ] ) with @xmath166 ; note that @xmath167 .",
    "the parameter @xmath108 now is obtained from @xmath168 with @xmath169      differentiation of @xmath45 gives the differential distribution @xmath44 from which we can calculate various moments and compare them to observations .",
    "for example , the flux - redshift relation can be obtained from [ zm ] < l(z)>=^_l ( lf()/(4d_l^2 f ( ) ) ) dl/. in a similar fashion one can derive @xmath170 or @xmath171 relations .",
    "some of the complications evident in the above analysis can be avoided if instead of the isophotal sizes and fluxes we deal with some values of these quantities .",
    "for example , if we define a proper metric size @xmath15 corresponding to a constant value of the function @xmath25 , say @xmath172 , as defined in p76 and  ( [ eta ] ) , then the expressions for the surface brightness , size and flux limits ( or truncations ) become considerably simplified . for a limiting  @xmath4 , a limiting angular radius @xmath64 and a limiting flux @xmath3",
    "these truncations are described by the following : [ bm ] b_0 /f ( ) ,   r_0 d_a/ ,  and  l f()/f ( ) , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "note that in contrast to the complicated truncations we found for the isophotal case ,  ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) , the current truncations are much simpler ; they depend only on one observational limit and the redshift .",
    "the above limits are good for @xmath175 , the size of the psf",
    ". this will always be true in this case because of the need to have a well defined  distribution .",
    "if the truncation limits are chosen so that @xmath176 , then the last limit in equation ( [ bm ] ) due to the flux limitation falls below the other two and can be ignored . in this case",
    "the data truncation in the @xmath89 plane is parallel to the axis making the calculation of the observables straight forward and free of the complex limits of integration . since the flux limit @xmath3 does not enter in the determination of the observed distribution of the sources , such a sample will not be appropriate data for tests based on source counts as a function of the flux @xmath3",
    "but such a sample can be used to obtain the distributions of the angular size , average surface brightness or redshift .",
    "for example the latter is simply [ nmz ] n ( , z)=dvdz_/f ( ) ^db_0 _ d_a/ ^dr_0 ( b_0,r_0,z ) .",
    "because of this simplification , such samples are well suited for tests based on the moments of the observed distributions .",
    "for example the angular size - redshift relation is simply given as [ tmz ] < ^2(z)>= dvdz _ /f ( ) ^db_0 _",
    "d_a/ ^dr_0 r^2_0 ( b_0,r_0,z ) .",
    "similarly , for the flux - redshift relation we have [ zmm ] < l(z)>= f ( ) dvdz _ /f",
    "( ) ^db_0 b_0 _",
    "d_a/ ^dr_0 r_0 ^ 2 ( b_0,r_0,z ) , or , in terms of the luminosity @xmath2 [ zmm ] < l(z)>= f()/f ( ) dvdz _ /f",
    "( ) ^db_0 _ l_min , ^dl l |(b_0,l , z ) , with a similar expression for the size-@xmath6 relation .",
    "the integration limit [ bm ] l_min , = 4d_l^2(^2 ) ( f()/^2)(b_0/ ) .",
    "these expressions are considerably simpler than the corresponding for the isophotal analysis .",
    "similar expressions can be derived for other definitions of the metric quantities .",
    "for example , as mentioned in  1 in connection with figures 1 and 2 , instead of @xmath15 one can use the effective radius @xmath30 , within which resides a certain fraction ( usually half ) of the total light .",
    "this would amount to a new definition of the constant @xmath177 as @xmath178 .",
    "this may be a convenient procedure for nearby galaxies but not at high reshifts , because it relies on the knowledge of the total flux , the determination of which lies at the heart of the difficulty associated with these tests .",
    "the procedure proposed in p76 relies only on the data within a specified radius and not on the data from the outer , invisible parts ; @xmath179 is obtained by setting the ratio of the average to limiting surface brightnesses to a fixed value .",
    "the discussions in the above two sections demonstrate that an accurate analysis of the extragalactic data for the purpose of cosmological tests is complicated and must include all of the above mentioned considerations . in particular , it is imperative to keep in mind the multivariate nature of the problem and to account for the surface brightness limitation , ( eq . [ [ biso ] ] ) , common in all of the above expressions . the dispersions in the distributions of @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath2 , and the correlations between these can have substantial effect on the final results .",
    "these effects are more pronounced when dealing with the isophotal quantities than with the metric ones .",
    "however , the latter procedure must be limited to well resolved sources , while the former , in principle , could be extended to unresolved sources if a good knowledge of the psf is at hand .",
    "this task , however complicated , can be carried out given the knowledge of the distribution function and the brightness profile . with sufficient care in the analysis of the data and in modeling one",
    "can determine either the cosmological evolution of the sources ( i.e. the redshift variation of the distribution @xmath34 ) or the cosmological parameters .",
    "such analyses , which may be simple or appropriate for data limited to low reshifts is not the simplest method to determine the cosmological or galactic evolutions . for example , the traditional method of identifying sources with some apparent flux may not be necessary or be the most straight forward way of carrying out this task . the complexities described in the previous sections",
    "are the result of the multiple selection criteria needed for counting individual galaxies .",
    "we now describe two new and much simpler tests which combine the good aspects and avoid the complexities of the two methods described above , and are much better suited for the analysis of modern digitized ccd data .",
    "the essence of these tests is to reduce the selection criteria to one , namely the surface brightness , and deal with the distribution of @xmath8 . in practice",
    "this amounts to simply counting the number of pixels at a given  ( or adding up their intensities ) independent of which galaxy they belong to .",
    "this way one can avoid the complexities arising from the need to define the sizes and fluxes ( isophotal or metric ) for every galaxy in the field .      the first of these tests , which is related to the angular diameter test , involves computation of the fraction of the sky which is covered by all galaxies above ( cumulative ) or within ( differential ) a given range of surface brightness , @xmath5 to @xmath180 .",
    "observational determination of this fraction is simple .",
    "it is accomplished by counting the number of pixels with a given intensity value .",
    "the expressions relating this quantity to the cosmological models and to the properties of the galaxies are decidedly ( somewhat ) simpler than those for the isophotal ( metric ) treatment .",
    "let us first consider well resolved sources , namely those with angular radii @xmath181 which we take to be @xmath182 . in this case",
    "the only data truncation arises from the size limit which is same as that described by  ( [ tiso ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) with the isophotal quantities replaced by those for an arbitrary value of @xmath5 .",

    "/ r_0=f^-1(b_z / b_0 )   with  b_0 b_z / f(d_a / r_0 ) .",
    "now following the same steps as in the previous sections the sky fraction covered by all galaxies down to a given apparent surface brightness @xmath5 is obtained by adding the contribution @xmath183 of each galaxy .",
    "the result is [ fsky ] f_sky(>b , z)=ddz_b_z ^db_0 x_b^2 _ d_a / x_b ^ dr_0 r_0 ^ 2 ( b_0,r_0,z ) , where the line element [ line ] d / dz=(dv / dz)(4d_a^2)^-1 .",

    "note that these equations have the simplicity of the tests based on metric values ;  ( [ fsky ] ) , except for the term @xmath184 is identical to @xmath185 , shown in equation ( [ tmz ] ) .",
    "however , more importantly , the data analysis is enormously simpler because it does not require determination of the  profile and the metric or isophotal values for each galaxy .    as in the case of the classical tests ,",
    "this test also can be carried out for unresolved sources .",
    "but this is not much different than counting sources because all unresolved sources have essentially the same area , @xmath186 .",
    "following the procedure in  * 2.3 * it can be shown that the sole truncation due to the  limit , @xmath187 , is equivalnt to [ lb ] l = 4d_a^2(_s^2b_0)l_b 4d_l^2(_s^2b ) and the actual angular radius of each source is given as @xmath188 . thus , the fraction of the sky covered by unresolved sources then becomes [ fskyp ] f_sky(>b , z)=dv dz ( _ s^2 ) _ b_z ^db_0",

    "then we do not need not to specify a size limit and the only truncation comes from the value of the apparent  @xmath5 .",
    "however , in this case we have the added complication due to the dependence of the characteristics on the ratio @xmath189 . for example ,  ( [ fsky ] ) now becomes [ fskyall ] f_sky(>b , z)=ddz_b_z ^ _ l_min , b ^dll x_b^2",

    "this amounts to adding all of the intensity values of the appropriate pixels .",

    "note that @xmath200 .",
    "the ratio of the quantities described in above two tests gives the average  at or down to some  @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity as expected is independent of the cosmological model parameters and depends only on the  profile and redshift and consequently , as already pointed out in p76 , can be used to to determine the evolution of the surface brightness . in general , this relation is more complicated than envisioned in p76 where the discussion was aimed at the brightest cluster galaxies . for a larger and varied sample of sources",
    "this relation is more complex and not as obvious .",
    "if , for purpose of illustration , we assume that @xmath8 and @xmath9 or @xmath2 are not correlated , then from  ( [ fskyall ] ) and its counterpart for @xmath201 , this ratio becomes [ avskyb ] < b(z , b)>=b ( _ b_z ^f(x_b)h(b_0)db_0 /_b_z ^x_b^2 f(x_b)h(b_0)db_0 ) , where @xmath128 describes the distribution of the central surface brightness . note that for a delta function , or a relatively narrow distribution , the above expression simplifies to @xmath202 as is the case with individual galaxies .",
    "this demonstrates that the surface brightness profile , or the function @xmath25 based on it , plays a central role in cosmological studies of extended sources .    with minor modification",
    "the above expressions will be valid for elliptical sources with constant ellipticity .",
    "for such sources with major and minor core radii @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the area within any isophotal limit is proportional to @xmath203 , so that if we define @xmath204 the above expressions would apply , but we now have the additional integration over the possible dispersion of the ellipticities or the ratio @xmath80 .",
    "in this paper we deal with the analysis of the distribution of redshift - size - flux ( or magnitude ) data on extrgalactic sources , in particular galaxies , which is often used for testing the evolution of sources and/or the universe .",
    "the usual practice is to describe the characteristics and evolution of the galaxies in terms of a simple luminosity function @xmath205 , as if the galaxies are point sources and the data is simply flux or magnitude limited .",
    "we emphasize that in reality these tests are more complicated .",
    "the proper analysis must involve the variation of the  profile and the multidimensional distribution function of the parameters that describe this profile , such as core radius , central surface brightness , luminosity , etc . ;",
    "@xmath206 . neglecting these copmlexities and the truncatios of the data produced by the  and angular size limits can lead to grossly misleading results .",
    "there are different ways one can account for these effects .",
    "the most efficient use of the observations comes from comparison of the full set of the data with model predictions which include the effects of all biases that are encountered in the observational selection processes .",
    "use of the isophotal values down to lowest posssible isophot and size is a good example of this approach .",
    "we have described the correct analysis of such a data in terms of the multivariate luminosity function @xmath34 .",
    "we derive the relevant expressions , in terms of the profile of spherical sources , which is to be compared with observations of the isophotal values of the fluxes , sizes and surface brightnesses . in general , because more than just the usual flux ( or magnitude ) limit enters in the analysis these expressions are relatively complex .",
    "truncation of the data due to other selection effects such as angular extent and thresholds come in and can play the dominant role in defining the content of a sample of sources .",
    "the  profile of the galaxies plays a pivotal role in these calculations .",
    "a second approach would be to select a subset of the data which yields to a more straight forward comparison with models .",
    "for example , if we select the more limited sample of large and well resolved sources , we can use fluxes and sizes related to a metric ( instead of isophotal ) radius , such as the radius defined in p76 for a constant value of the @xmath25 function .",
    "we derive the relevant expressions for this case and show that they are much simpler than the isophotal ones , and resemble more closely the simple expressions for point sources .",
    "this method , therefore , would be more appropriate for evaluation of the moments of the observed distributions in tests like the redshift - flux or angular size - redshift tests .",
    "the isophotal method is more appropriate approach for tests based on source counts and , in principle , can be used for samples of sources which include resolved as well as unresolved sources . with the knowledge of the psf at hand one can use a modified  profile as convolution of the actual profile and the psf .",
    "the above tests , aside from the complications in the modeling , suffer from the additional shortcoming of needing elaborate procedures for the analysis of the data . to overcome some of the difficulties in both of these areas we propose a new method for the analysis and modeling of extended extragalactic sourses for the purpose of determining either their evolution or the cosmological parameters .",
    "this method is very well suited to modern digitized data , and amounts to counting the numbers of pixels or summing their intensity values .",
    "it is capable of using all the data as in the isophotal case but the expressions relating the data to models are considerably simpler and are similar to the metric ones .",
    "their simplicity stems from the fact that they deal with the surface brightness limit alone and do not include selection based on fluxes or sizes .",
    "as already shown in p76 , tests based on  tend to be more robust and simpler .",
    "\\c ) the dependence on the cosmological parameters is also considerably more straight forward : instead of the dependence on the volume @xmath207 , and on the luminosity and angular diameter distances , @xmath38 and @xmath91 , the new tests depend primarily on the redshift and the much simpler line element @xmath208 .",
    "for example , for models with zero cosmological constant this is equal to @xmath209 , where @xmath41 is the density parameter and @xmath210 is the hubble constant .",
    "\\d ) because we are dealing with surface brightness , to first order the resulting expressions are independent of the weak gravitational lensing effects due to the inhomogeneities of the intervening matter distribution ( clumpiness due to galaxies and clusters ) .",
    "as mentioned above the modern digitized ccd data are ideally suited for the task proposed here .",
    "however , several conditions are required for the proper application of all the tests proposed here .",
    "a good knowledge of the background sky brightness due to all other sources except extragalactic sources underconsideration is needed because we wish to go to as low a surface brightness as possible .",
    "application of the new methods to integrated ( over the redshift ) values of @xmath211 and @xmath212 to the whole data say , in a ccd frame , will require accurate flat fielding .",
    "however , for redshift dependent type analysis the requirements are similar to galaxy based analysis , because redshifts are known for galaxies as a whole and not for indvidual pixels . for this kind of studies some identification of the pixels with galaxies",
    "is necessary so that we can assign redshifts to pixels .",
    "secondly , when combining resolved and unresolved galaxies it is important that contaminations due to other unresolved sources such as stars is kept to an acceptable value . and finally , in all these tests one must deal with several profiles ; disks , spheroids and possibly a continuum of superposition of both . in future works we hope to use these new methods on the data from the hubble deep field",
