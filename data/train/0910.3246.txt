    "the latter contributes roughly 75% to the total energy budget , the former about 20% . only about 5% are in the form of conventional , baryonic matter .",
    "the preferred model is the @xmath0cdm model which also plays the role of a reference model for alternative approaches to the de problem .",
    "while the @xmath0cdm model can describe most of the observations , there still remain puzzles @xcite .",
    "the present situation in the field is characterized , e.g. , in @xcite and references therein .",
    "both dm and de manifest themselves observationally only through their gravitational action . in most studies both these components",
    "are regarded as independent .",
    "however , there exists a line of investigation that explores the consequences of a coupling within the dark sector .",
    "corresponding models show a richer dynamics than models with separately conserved energy - momentum tensors .",
    "it has been argued that ignoring a potentially existing interaction between both components may give rise to misinterpretations of observational data regarding the equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xcite . a coupling between dm and de may also be relevant with respect to the coincidence problem ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "models with an interaction matter ",

    "limits for the admissible interaction strength have been obtained for various configurations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion can be understood as a pure interaction phenomenon in the context of holographic de models @xcite .",
    "recently it was argued that the latest snia could favor a scenario in which the cosmic acceleration has past a maximum value and is now slowing down again @xcite .",
    "in such a case the accelerated expansion could be a transient phenomenon with a late - time dynamics , incompatible with that of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "it is this possibility which we are going to study in the present paper .",
    "we mention that models of transient acceleration were already discussed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide a toy model which describes a transient cosmological acceleration as the consequence of an interaction between dark matter and dark energy .",
    "such a dynamics can not be obtained if the interaction represents a small correction to , say , the @xmath0cdm model . for models of this type",
    "the long - time cosmological dynamics will always be determined by the cosmological term and result in accelerated expansion . to achieve transient accelerated expansion , a twofold role of the interaction is necessary . at first",

    "in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background , a fluid with an equation of state @xmath61 is dynamically equivalent to a cosmological constant . according to the @xmath0cdm model , a small ( in planck units ) , but so far theoretically unexplained , cosmological",
    "constant is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of our present universe .",
    "we have demonstrated that an interaction between such type of dark energy and dark matter re - normalizes this constant . even if the resulting effective cosmological constant",
    "is assumed to be zero , the time - dependent part of the interaction ( the part that does not contribute to the re - normalization ) was shown to be able to generate a phase of accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "we have studied two types of interactions for which cosmic acceleration is a transient phenomenon .",
    "while recent investigations favor a scenario in which the acceleration of the universe is already slowing down today @xcite , our toy model predicts the maximal acceleration to occur at a future time .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model is unable to provide any type of transient acceleration dynamics .",
    "a statistical analysis of the snia data shows that models of transient accelerated expansion may well be competitive with the standard cosmological constant model .",
    "while the mentioned cancelation mechanism of the  bare \" cosmological constant is purely phenomenological , we believe that it might possibly indicate a more fundamental feature .",
    "a vanishing total effective cosmological constant seems more appealing and easier to understand within an underlying basic theory than a small , non - vanishing value of this quantity .    in general , our conclusion concerning the potentially transient character of the cosmic acceleration as the result of an interaction in the dark sector coincides with the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "but we think that an analytic solution , even though it is the solution of a toy model , provides additional information about the specific role of the interaction in this scenario and thus gives rise to a physically more transparent picture .",
