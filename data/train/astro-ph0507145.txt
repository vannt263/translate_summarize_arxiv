    "the lmc supersoft source cal  83 is one of the rare group of x - ray binaries in which most of the radiation is emitted below @xmath10.5 kev ( e.g. hasinger 1994 ; greiner 1996 ; cowley et al .",
    "cal  83 is a highly luminous source and is generally considered to be the prototype of this class .",
    "it has long been known to be variable in x - rays ( e.g. brown et al .",
    "1994 ; kahabka 1997 ) .",
    "it was shown by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and later greiner & di stefano ( 2002 ) , that the high and low x - ray states are correlated with the optical behavior of the system , with x - ray low states being followed @xmath150 days later by optical dimming in which the system fades by about a magnitude .",
    "additionally , cal  83 shows evidence of bipolar jets ( crampton et al . 1987 ) , as do several other supersoft x - ray binaries ( cowley et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "cal  83 is thought to contain a rapidly accreting , fairly massive white dwarf ( @xmath21.3@xmath3 ) and a @xmath10.5@xmath3 donor star .",
    "the system is viewed nearly pole - on ( @xmath4 ) , resulting in only a small velocity variation through its 1.047-day orbital period .",
    "the optical light varies approximately sinusoidally by @xmath10.2 mag through the orbit ( smale et al .",
    "1998 ; schmidtke et al .",
    "2004 ) , although shorter timescale variations appear to be present in the light curves shown by smale et al .",
    "many classes of white dwarfs , including those in binary systems , show periodic changes on timescales of tens of minutes . in most cases",
    "the variations are attributed to nonradial pulsations of the compact star ( e.g.  arras et al .",
    "short - timescale periodicites have also been found during the supersoft phases in some classical novae .",
    "drake et al .  ( 2003 ) reported x - ray variations with p@xmath12500 s ( 42 minutes ) in v1494 aql ( nova aql 1999 no .  2 ) and ness et al .",

    "we have carried out a period analysis of x - ray data for cal  83 from the @xmath0 and _ xmm - newton _ observatories .",
    "the x - ray data were kindly supplied to us by dr .",
    "thierry lanz , whose investigation looked at the source s spectral properties .",
    "the goal of our study was to search for short - period pulsations that might be present in the x - ray flux .",
    "cal  83 was observed with @xmath5 high resolution camera and low energy transmission grating ( letg ) for 35.4 ks on 2001 august 15 - 16 , as reported by lanz et al .",
    "this instrument configuration provides spectral coverage from 1 to 175  , but the observed signal was restricted to the range 20 - 70   ( a description of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ is given by weisskopf et al .",
    "the data were corrected for background counts and binned in 200-s segments .",
    "details of the observations are given by lanz et al .",
    ", and x - ray light curves from both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories are displayed in their fig .",
    "we have replotted the _",
    "light curve in the top panel of fig .  1 , adding orbital phases based on the cal  83 photometric ephemeris given by schmidtke et al .  ( 2004 ) .",
    "phase zero corresponds to minimum optical light .",
    "the letg x - ray light curve is characterized by rapid variability superposed on a gradual decline .",
    "a small change in the mean x - ray flux occurs near mjd 52136.826 ( higher before , lower thereafter ) , or @xmath6 , which is close to the predicted time of maximum optical brightness .",
    "the lack of correlation between x - ray and optical data suggests the x - ray decline is not related to orbital orientation , although strictly simultaneous observations would be needed to confirm this .    in order to optimize the search for variations on short timescales , the light curve was first prewhitened by removing the overall downward trend .",
    "we experimented with several techniques ( including linear and low - order polynomial fits ) but opted to model and remove the level change as if it were a periodic signal that is longer than the data train itself .",
    "this long - timescale variation is shown by a dashed curve in fig .  1",
    ". we stress , however , that all detrending techniques identified the same short period , as described below .",
    "the detrended flux was searched for high - frequency signals by calculating a normalized periodogram ( horne & baliunas 1986 ) , with 5000 test frequencies between @xmath7=1 day@xmath8 to @xmath9=216 day@xmath8 ( the nyquist frequency for 200-s data samples ) .",
    "this periodogram is shown in the top panel of fig .  2 .",
    "the most prominent peak lies near p=0.03 days and is also present in the original , non - detrended data . to test the significance of this peak",
    ", we created 1000 randomized data sets , by shuffling fluxes and dates , and then calculated their periodograms .",
    "a simple tally of the highest power found in each of the random sets was used to estimate the confidence level .",
    "the dashed line in the figure indicates the power of the 95% level , above which only 5% of the random sets had a greater peak .",
    "the peak at p=0.03 day has a confidence level @xmath1097% .",
    "similar analysis of the background flux does not show this period , hence we conclude it is a bona fide signal .",
    "the best - fit sine wave has a period of 0.0267 days , or 38.4 minutes .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude is 1.9@xmath11 erg s@xmath8 @xmath12 , which represents a @xmath123% variation of the mean value of the source s non - detrended flux .",
    "3 shows the detrended letg x - ray light curve for cal  83 folded on the 38.4-minute period .",
    "a 45.1 ks observation of cal  83 was obtained with _ xmm - newton observatory _ ( jansen et al . 2001 ) on 2000 april 23 , using both the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) and european photon imaging camera ( epic ) .",
    "details of the data acquisition and reduction were presented by paerels et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and lanz et al .",
    "our work in this paper is restricted to a period analysis of their published data .",
    "the rgs data are in the range of 20 - 40  , hence they overlap the spectral coverage of the @xmath0 data .",
    "the observations were background subtracted and binned into 200-s intervals . in the middle panel of fig .  1 we plot the rgs x - ray light curve .",
    "the x - ray flux is characterized by rapid variations superimposed on a more gradual series of rises and declines .",
    "low levels occur near orbital phase 0.96 ( close to optical minimum light ) as well as around @xmath13=0.77 and 0.18 .",
    "the origin of these gradual variations is uncertain .",
    "they may arise from errors in subtraction of the background , which shows periodicities at 0.78 , 0.27 and 0.13 days .",
    "similar to the processing of letg data , we first removed the gradual variations of the rgs flux ( shown by a dashed line in the figure ) and then calculated a periodogram of the remaining flux .",
    "the result is displayed in the middle panel of fig .",
    "several minor peaks with normalized power in the range 5 - 7 are present , but all of them fall substantially below the 95% confidence level , so formally none of them are significant .    _",
    "xmm - newton",
    "_ epic observations of cal  83 , taken simultaneously with the rgs data , are shown in the bottom panel of fig .  1 .",
    "only those events with energies in the range 0.2 - 0.8 kev ( @xmath160 - 160  ) were included in the analysis .",
    "the observations are divided into three segments , with intervening gaps that degrade the period analysis .",
    "data from the first segment are relatively flat , while those in the second and third segments show a general rise and decline , respectively .",
    "again , we modeled and removed these slow variations , using the curve shown in the figure .",
    "a periodogram of the detrended flux is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 . like the rgs data ,",
    "only minor peaks are present , with confidence levels significantly less than 95% .",
    "we note that the strongest peaks in the epic data are different than those of the simultaneous rgs data .",
    "the @xmath0 and _ xmm - newton _ data sets examined here were taken about 16 months apart . ignoring signatures that are related to windowing of the observations , caused by errors in background subtraction , etc . , we find only one meaningful periodicity in the detrended data : p=0.03 days in the @xmath0 letg observations .",
    "such a short timescale can not be reconciled with the known orbit of the companion star , and the lack of longterm stability of the signal argues against stellar rotation .",
    "it is also unlikely that the periodic signal originates in accretion disk .",
    "since the x - ray luminosities of the letg and rgs observations are similar , one would expect the mass - transfer rate , and presumably the underlying disk structure , to be somewhat the same at the two epochs .",
    "however , the power spectra of these data sets are quite different .",
    "additional observations are needed to ascertain whether changes that we find in the power spectra of cal  83 are related to other system parameters .",
    "the source exhibits at least two optical states ( greiner & di stefano 2002 ; schmidtke & cowley 2004 ) , but we have no information on the state at the epochs to the x - ray observations . since the x - rays pulsations seen nova are transient in nature , so it is reasonable to assume that signals in classical sourses would be changeable as well .",
    "the most likely cause of the observed short - period variations is nonradial pulsations of the accreting white dwarf . in @xmath0 observations of the supersoft phase of v1494 aql ( nova aql 1999 no .",
    "2 ) , drake et al .  ( 2003 ) found not just a single periodic signal ( strongest near p=2500 s ) but an entire suite of periods between 526 and 3461 s. these were interpreted as coming from nonradial @xmath14 pulsation modes . the periodograms of cal  83 are similar . in particular , we note the many minor peaks found here in the rgs and epic data are in roughly the same period range as those present in the v1494 aql observations .",
    "rapid variations also are present in the optical light curves of cal  83",
    ". visual examination of the extensive photometry presented by smale et al .",
    "( 1988 ) shows considerable structure on timescales much less than 0.1 day .",
    "although the individual measurements are no longer available in suitable format for detailed analysis , it would be an interesting exercise to search the optical data for periodicities like those found in the x - ray observations .",
    "synoptic observations of this source have been taken by the macho project , but the temporal resolution is insufficient to search for periodicities on the order of tens of minutes .",
    "additional observations are needed to ascertain whether the changes found in the power spectra of cal  83 are related to other system parameters .",
    "for example , the source is known to exhibit at least two optical states , but there is no information on the state at either epoch of the x - ray observations .",
    "since the x - rays pulsations seen in novae are transient in nature , it is reasonable to assume that similar signals in classical supersoft sources might not always be detected .    in summary",
    ", we have examined the @xmath0 and _ xmm - newton _ observations of cal  83 and have found variability with a period of 38.4 minutes in one of the x - ray data sets .",
    "the variations most likely arise from nonradial pulsations of the accreting white dwarf .",
    "this is the first detection of pulsations in a classical supersoft x - ray binary ."
