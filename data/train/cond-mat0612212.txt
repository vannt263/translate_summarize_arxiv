    "the quantization of charge and the diffraction of quantum waves lead to fluctuations in the transport state of electrical conductors even in the limit of absolute zero temperature @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations provide additional information not available from conductance measurements alone .",
    "this has led to considerable theoretical @xcite and experimental efforts @xcite to characterize fluctuations not only on the level of noise but including all higher order cumulants .",
    "these efforts have been focused almost exclusively on the statistics of transferred charge @xcite , i.e.  on the cumulants of currents measured at a contact of a conductor .",
    "clearly , there are however also other quantities of interest . for example",
    ", fluctuations of the charge inside a conductor @xcite ( as opposed to transferred charge ) are closely connected to electrostatic potential fluctuations in a conductor @xcite and are thus essential in determining the long range coulomb interaction of two nearby conductors .",
    "still another example is fluctuations of voltage .",
    "the statistics of voltage have been investigated for a mesoscopic conductor in series with a classical impedance @xcite and for networks of two - terminal conductors @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider voltage probes which connect to a conductor within its phase - coherent volume @xcite .",
    "we determine the fluctuations of the voltage at the probe @xcite and determine the joint probability distribution between the voltage fluctuations and the charge transferred into a contact of the conductor .",
    "voltage probes are real elements of mesoscopic conductors and are used to gain information of the interior state of the system .",
    "we compare the fluctuations at a voltage probe with the fluctuations at a dephasing probe .",
    "this latter probe conserves not only charge but also energy @xcite . at a dephasing probe",
    "the occupation number fluctuates @xcite .",
    "voltage and dephasing probes provide a simple means to introduce incoherent events in an otherwise quantum coherent conductor @xcite .",
    "we examine these correlations with the help of a ( quantum ) langevin approach @xcite . in a second step",
    "we derive a generating function for the correlations using a semi - classical path integral approach @xcite . on the level of conductance and noise the langevin approach and the saddle point solution of the path integral approach",
    "are shown to agree .",
    "we have earlier demonstrated that for the statistics of transferred charge both a single channel voltage probe and the single channel dephasing probe lead to the same counting functional if the scattering matrix of the conductor is energy independent in the range of applied voltages @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that this equivalence does not hold for the joint distribution of voltage ( or occupation number ) fluctuations and transferred charge .    the characterization of the transport fluctuations not only in terms of transferred charges but also of internal properties is a central motivation of this work .",
    "voltage fluctuations at a probe test carrier fluctuations that can still be evaluated in an approach that considers samples with terminals only .",
    "it is particularly interesting for conductors which exhibit quantum interference since voltage and dephasing probes are phase breaking elements .",
    "a carrier that enters a probe is eventually replaced by a carrier that is re - emitted into the conductor with a phase ( and in the case of a voltage probe , an energy ) that is unrelated to the exiting carrier .",
    "this carrier is detected in the voltage probe and thus does not contribute to certain interference processes .",
    "phase breaking and which path detection are generally closely linked phenomena @xcite .",
    "this provides another motivation to investigate the fluctuations at the probes ( the which path detectors ) and their correlations with the transmitted current .",
    "the langevin approach is a convenient tool to investigate current and voltage correlations in mesoscopic conductors @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated in numerous papers , see e.g. refs .",
    "importantly , the langevin approach also allows one to obtain information on the fluctuation properties of a probe connected to the mesoscopic conductor . in this section",
    "we investigate the average current and potentials as well as the auto- and cross - correlations .",
    "it is possible to extend the langevin approach successively to higher order correlations , giving rise to cascade corrections @xcite . in section [ fcs ]",
    "we instead directly determine the generating function of the correlations , making use of a stochastic path integral approach @xcite .",

    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the auto- and cross correlations ( actually all cumulants ) of the current in a conductor coupled to a single mode probe are independent of whether the probe is a voltage or a dephasing probe for the case that scattering is energy independent .",
    "interestingly , this does not hold for the fluctuations of the probe : there is a clear difference between the potential fluctuations of a voltage probe and the occupation number fluctuations of the dephasing probe .",
    "all the examples are quantum hall bars of different complexity subject to a high magnetic field .",
    "current is transported by an edge state at filling factor one , where carriers move in one specific direction along the edge of the structure .",

    "the beam splitter is the smallest unit that the interfering structures are composed of , we chose it here as a simple and instructive example to show how a voltage or dephasing probe behaves .",
    "for simplicity we consider the scattering matrix of all structures to be energy independent . in the following we present briefly the setups of the four examples .",
    "the results are collected in table [ table1 ] and table [ table2 ] .    *",
    "the * beam splitter * @xcite is formed by a quantum point contact with transmission probability @xmath64 , situated between two terminals @xmath65 and @xmath11 , as shown in fig .  [ beamsplitter ] .",
    "a probe -either a voltage or a dephasing probe- is perfectly coupled to the setup , such that every particle transmitted through the beam splitter enters the probe and moves then from the probe into contact @xmath11 . * an electronic * mach - zehnder interferometer * ( mzi ) is shown in fig .",

    "the transmission ( reflection ) probabilities of the beam splitters are @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) respectively .",
    "interference occurs , because the electrons have two alternative paths to propagate through the interferometer between beam splitter @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "an aharonov - bohm flux threads the two arms , and the different vector potentials in the two arms lead to a phase difference @xmath73 .",
    "this difference creates a characteristic flux - periodicity in the interference pattern , the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "a voltage or dephasing probe is attached to the upper arm .",

    "such a setup was recently realized experimentally @xcite and has since generated further works @xcite .",
    "if the length of the two interferometer arms is not equal , the transmission through the interferometer will be energy dependent due to the geometric phase a particle acquires .",
