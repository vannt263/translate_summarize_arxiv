    "prediction of the critical behavior of modified spin models ( site or bond diluted , random bonds , random fields ) , called disordered systems , has been the subject of many studies in the last decades , since this modification brings about considerable changes in the critical behavior of these systems , such as replacement of a first - order phase transition ( fopt ) by a second - order phase transition ( sopt ) , depression of tricritical points and critical end points , new critical points and universality classes , etc @xcite .",
    "the study of the disordered systems is based on the standard models , ising , blume - capel , baxter - wu , heisenberg , etc , modified accordingly to meet the case under consideration .",
    "furthermore , extensions and versions of these models can be applied to describe many other different situations , such as multicomponent fluids , ternary alloys , @xmath12he -@xmath13he mixtures , in addition to the magnetic systems for which these were initially conceived . the most extensively studied model in statistical and condensed matter physics",
    "is the spin-1/2 ising model , since its two dimensional version was analytically solved by onsager ( without an external magnetic field ) ; as a consequence , it has formed the prototype for various generalizations . in its modified versions ,",
    "it exhibits a variety of multicritical phenomena , such as a phase diagram with ordered ferromagnetic and disordered paramagnetic phases separated by a transition line that changes from an sopt to an fopt joined by a tricritical point ( tcp ) ; besides these , critical points , critical end points , ordered critical points of various orders , re - entrance can appear as in the presence of random fields .",
    "the multicritical phenomena appear in systems presenting competition among distinct types of ordering and there are numerous circumstances in which this kind of phenomenon can arise . in ferromagnetic systems in the presence of random fields ,",
    "the competition is between the parallel and random orderings , causing , occasionally , the conversion of a continuous transition into an fopt and the subsequent appearance of tcp as well as re - entrance in some cases .",
    "random - field effects on magnetic systems have been systematically studied not only for their own merit but for their experimental importance , as well .    in two dimensions",
    "an infinitesimal amount of field randomness destroys any fopt @xcite .",
    "one such situation is the presence of random magnetic fields acting on each spin in an otherwise free of defects lattice ; the respective pure system is considered to be described by ising model , which is now transformed into the random field ising model ( rfim ) @xcite .",
    "rfim had been the standard vehicle for studying the effects of quenched randomness on phase diagrams and critical properties of lattice spin systems and was studied for many years since the seminal work of imry and ma @xcite .",
    "associated with this model are the notions of lower critical dimension , tricritical points , higher order critical points and random field probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the simplest model exhibiting a tricritical phase diagram in the absence of randomness is the blume - capel model  a regular ising spin-@xmath14 model @xcite .",
    "although much effort has been invested in the study of the rfim , the only well - established conclusion is the existence of a phase transition for @xmath15 ( d space dimension ) , that is , the critical lower dimension @xmath16 is 2 , resulted after a long controversial discussion @xcite , while many other questions are still unanswered ; among them are those of the order of the phase transition , the existence of a tricritical point ( tcp ) and the dependence of these on the form of the random field pdf . according to the mean field approximation ( mfa )",
    ", the choice of the random field pdf can lead to a continuous ferromagnetic / paramagnetic ( fm / pm ) boundary as in the single gaussian pdf , whereas for the symmetric bimodal pdf this boundary is divided into two parts , an sopt branch for high temperatures and an fopt branch for low temperatures separated by a tcp at @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the coordination number , @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath21 are the tricritical temperature and random field , respectively , so that for @xmath22 and @xmath23 the transition to the fm phase is of first order . however , this behaviour is not fully elucidated since in the case of the three dimensional rfim the high temperature series expansions yield only continuous transitions for both pdfs @xcite ; according to houghton et al @xcite both distributions ( single gaussian and bimodal ) predict a tricritical point with @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the bimodal and @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the gaussian with critical standard deviation @xmath28 .",
    "galam and birman studied the crucial issue for the existence of a tcp within the mean field theory for a general pdf @xmath29 ( random magnetic field ) by using an even degree free energy expansion up to eighth degree in the order parameter ; they proposed some inequalities between the derivatives of the pdf up to sixth order at zero magnetic field for the possible existence of a tcp @xcite . in monte carlo studies for @xmath30 , machta et al @xcite , using a gaussian distribution , could not reach a definite conclusion concerning the nature of the transition , since for some realizations of randomness the magnetization histogram was two - peaked ( implying an sopt ) whereas for other ones it was three - peaked implying an fopt ; middleton and fisher @xcite , using a similar distribution for @xmath31 , suggested an sopt with a small order parameter exponent @xmath32 ; fytas et al @xcite , following the wang - landau and lee entropic sampling schemes for the bimodal distribution function with random field strengths @xmath33 and @xmath34 for a simple cubic lattice found only an sopt by applying the lee - kosterlitz free energy barrier method . hern@xmath35ndez and co - workers claim that they have found a crossover between an sopt and an fopt at a finite temperature and magnetic field for the bimodal distribution function @xcite .",
    "one of the main issues was the experimental realization of random fields .",
    "fishman and aharony @xcite have shown that the randomly quenched exchange interaction ising antiferromagnet in a uniform field @xmath36 is equivalent to a ferromagnet in a random field with the strength of the random field linearly proportional to the induced magnetization .",
    "also another interesting result found by galam @xcite via the mfa was that the ising antiferromagnets in a uniform field with either a general random site exchange or site dilution have the same multicritical space as the random field ising model with the bimodal pdf .",
    "the usual pdf for the random field is either the symmetric bimodal    @xmath37    where @xmath10 is the fraction of lattice sites having a magnetic field @xmath5 , while the rest fraction @xmath38 of lattice sites has a field @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite , or the gaussian , single or double symmetric ,    @xmath41              \\nonumber   \\\\ p(h_{i } ) & = & \\frac{1}{2 }   \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi \\sigma^{2})^{1/2 } } \\left\\{exp\\left[-\\frac{(h_{i}-h_{0})^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right ] + exp\\left[-\\frac{(h_{i}+h_{0})^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{sexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with mean value zero and ( @xmath42 ) , respectively , and standard deviation @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "galam and aharony , in a series of investigations , presented a detailed analysis via the mean field and renormalization group of a system consisting of @xmath44component classical spins ( finally choosing @xmath45 ) on a @xmath46dimensional lattice of a uniaxially anisotropic ferromagnet in a longitudinal random field extracted from a symmetric bimodal pdf ( @xmath47 ) without and with a uniform magnetic field along the easy axis , respectively @xcite .",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy was chosen to be along the easy axis and the exchange couplings were of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the anisotropy and @xmath50 . depending on the anisotropy ( small , medium , large ) a variety of phases ( longitudinal , transverse , paramagnetic ) , critical points , bicritical points , and critical end points as well as a multicritical point ( an intersection of bicritical , tricritical and critical - end - point lines ) resulted .",
    "in addition to these purely theoretical investigations , galam proposed a model ( diluted random field ) in his attempt to reproduce some of the features in the phase diagram of the experimental sample consisting of the mixed cyanide crystals @xmath51 , where @xmath52 stands for an alkali metal ( k , na , rb ) and @xmath53 a spherical halogen ion ( br , cl , i ) ; the dilution of the pure crystal @xmath54 is achieved by replacing @xmath55 by the halogen ions @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the pure alkali - cyanide @xmath54 crystal ferroelastic transition disappears at some concentration @xmath56 of the cyanide ; its numerical value depends on both components @xmath57 . by choosing a model hamiltonian ( ferromagnetic ising - type with nearest neighbor interaction ) with dilution and a symmetric trimodal pdf for the random fields galam , using mfa , managed to predict the involved first and second order phase transitions with the interfering tcp as well as the respective concentration for a phase transition to occur depending on the procedure considered .",
    "the random fields were necessary because there were experimental evidences that below @xmath56 cyanide displayed orientational freezing and the random fields were used for fixing this orientation .",
    "the involved probability @xmath58 in pdf as well as the critical threshold @xmath56 were expressed in terms of microscopic quantities .",
    "recently , the asymmetric bimodal pdf ( [ bimodalp ] ) with @xmath59 , in general , has also been studied in detail @xcite as well as the respective one with random anisotropic interactions @xmath60 @xcite , with the competition parameter @xmath6 varying in the interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the former study has revealed that for some values of @xmath10 and @xmath5 , the pm / fm boundary is exclusively of second order ; however , for some other ranges of these variables this boundary consists of two branches , a second order one and another of first order with an intervening tcp , thus confirming the existence of such a point , whose temperature depends only on the probability @xmath10 in ( [ bimodalp ] ) .",
    "in addition to these findings , re - entrance has occurred as well as complex magnetization profiles with respect the random field strength @xmath5 . for @xmath61 , the symmetric bimodal pdf , the results found by aharony",
    "were confirmed @xcite . in the latter study ,",
    "the anisotropic interactions ( introduced through the parameter @xmath6 , with @xmath62 $ ] ) do not change the numerical value of the tricritical temperatures ( they still depend on @xmath10 only ) , whereas the tcp random field ( @xmath63 ) as well as auxiliary one ( @xmath64 ) change as @xmath6 varies .",
    "another important influence of @xmath6 is to reduce the fm region allocated to the system as @xmath6 tends to @xmath14 ( @xmath65 ) and simultaneously broaden the pm region ; however , the overall structure of the phase diagram as a function of @xmath6 for a specific value of @xmath10 is unchanged , the only influence of @xmath6 on it is to cause a parallel translation of the wider phase diagram , occurring for @xmath66 inwards , towards the t axis as @xmath6 increases , thus reducing the fm region ; the largest reduction occurs for @xmath67 .",
    "an immediate generalization of the asymmetric bimodal ( [ bimodalp ] ) is the asymmetric trimodal one ,    @xmath68    where @xmath3 . in earlier studies , the partial probabilities",
    "@xmath9 had been considered as equal and related to @xmath69 by the relation @xmath70 , symmetric pdf @xcite ; recently unequal @xmath9 , ( @xmath71 ) were considered , asymmetric pdf @xcite .",
    "the third - peak , introduced in addition to the other two ones in the bimodal ( [ bimodalp ] ) and associated with the third term in ( [ trimodal ] ) , is to allow for the presence of non magnetic particles or vacancies in the lattice that are not affected by the random magnetic fields and results in reducing the randomness of the system , as well .",
    "a direct result of the choice of this pdf is that the respective physical system , depending on the values of @xmath72 , can have one tricritical point and , in some cases , it can have two such points , in contrast to the bimodal pdf , which has only one such point in both versions , @xcite .    for the critical exponents of the three - dimensional rfim , it seems that there is broad consensus concerning their values except for the specific heat exponent @xmath73 , for which there is much dispute concerning its numerical value , since its sign is widely accepted to be negative .",
    "the main sources of information for the critical exponents are monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , they provide various values depending on the probability distribution considered .",
    "middleton and fisher concluded that the @xmath73-exponent is near zero , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "rieger and young , considering the bimodal distribution , estimated @xmath75 @xcite , rieger , using the single gaussian distribution , estimated @xmath76 @xcite , whereas hartmann and young , from ground - state calculations , estimated @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "nowak et al estimated that @xmath76 @xcite , whereas dukovski and machta found a positive value , namely , @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "malakis and fytas @xcite , by applying the critical minimum - energy subspace scheme in conjunction with the wang - landau and broad - histogram methods for cubic lattices , proved that the specific heat and susceptibility are non - self - averaging using the bimodal distribution .",
    "the same ambiguous situation prevails in experimental measurements ; see ref . @xcite .",
    "another possible generalization for the trimodal pdf ( [ trimodal ] ) is to assume that the random field takes on different values in the up and down directions ( anisotropy ) , namely ,    @xmath79    where @xmath6 ( competition parameter ) is the ratio of the two fields in the up and down directions with @xmath80 $ ] , since for @xmath81 the two random fields will act in the same direction without competition , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the rfim with the asymmetric and anisotropic trimodal pdf ( [ trimodalr ] ) with arbitrary values for the partial probabilities @xmath9 and @xmath82 in order to investigate the phase diagrams , phase transitions , tricritical points and magnetization profiles with respect to @xmath5 and compare these results with those of the isotropic case ( @xmath83 ) studied earlier @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the suitable hamiltonian is introduced , and the respective free energy and equation of state for the magnetization are derived . in section @xmath84 ,",
    "the phase diagram , tricritical points and magnetization profiles for various values of @xmath6 and @xmath9 are calculated and discussed ; we close with the conclusions in section @xmath85 .",

    "we also consider that @xmath89 so that the ground state is ferromagnetic in the absence of random fields .",
    "the presence of randomness involves two averaging procedures , the usual thermal average , denoted by angular brackets @xmath90 , and the disorder average over the random fields denoted by @xmath91 for the respective pdf .    for the asymmetric ( @xmath71 ) and anisotropic ( @xmath92 ) bimodal / trimodal pdfs",
    ", we also make additional assumptions concerning the random field moments    @xmath93    the former relation in ( [ h0 ] ) vanishes for a symmetric and isotropic pdf ( @xmath94 ) , whereas for an asymmetric pdf ( @xmath71 ) is non - zero implying that the system is under the influence of a residual magnetic field due to the asymmetry and anisotropy of the random field , thereby affecting system s magnetization ; a similar case has appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well .",
    "the latter relation implies that there is no correlation between @xmath4 at different lattice sites .",

    "<S> , we write down the equilibrium equation for the magnetization and solve it for both phase transitions and at the tricritical point in order to determine the magnetization profile with respect to @xmath5 , considered as an independent variable in addition to the temperature .    </S>",
