    "it is well known that in quantum gravity and string theory , there is a lower bound to the possible resolution of distances , i.e. , a minimal observable length on the scale of the planck length of @xmath0 m. this minimal length may be introduced as an additional uncertainty in position measurements , so that the standard heisenberg uncertainty relation becomes : @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is a small positive parameter @xcite .",
    "it is clear that in this new relation , @xmath3 is always larger than @xmath4 .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the introduction of specific corrections to the usual canonical commutation relations between position and momentum operators imply this new generalized uncertainty relation in a natural way .",
    "this formalism , based on a noncommutative heisenberg algebra , together with the new concepts it implies , has been discussed in one and more dimensions @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory ( qft ) has also been reformulated within this framework , and it has been shown , in particular that , this minimal length may regularize unwanted divergencies @xcite .",
    "in addition to its importance in qft , a minimal length may have a great interest in nonrelativistic or relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , it has been argued @xcite that this length may be viewed as an intrinsic scale characterizing the system under study .",
    "consequently , the formalism based on these deformed commutation relations may provide a new model for an effective description of complex systems such as quasiparticules and various collectives excitations in solids , or composite particules such as nucleons , nuclei , and molecules @xcite .",
    "various topics were studied over the last ten years , in connection with this formalism : the spectrum of the hydrogen atom has been obtained perturbatively in coordinate space by several authors @xcite , whereas its momentum space treatment was done in ref .",
    "the authors found an upper bound of about @xmath5 fm for the minimal length by exploiting the experimental data from precision hydrogen spectroscopy ( the lamb shift ) . the harmonic oscillator potential has also been solved exactly in arbitrary dimensions @xcite and perturbatively @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an upper bound for the minimal lengh has been calculated by confronting theoretical results to precision measurement of electrons trapped in a strong magnetic field ; it is of the same order of magnitude as the result obtained in the hydrogen atom problem .",
    "the influence of the minimal length on the casimir energy between two parallel plates has also been examined @xcite .",
    "the problem of a charged particle of spin one - half moving in a constant magnetic field has been treated within the minimal length formalism , and the thermal properties of the system at high temperatures have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the minimal length was introduced in the dirac equation in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a one - dimensional dirac oscillator has been solved exactly ; in three dimensions , this problem has been solved using supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "finally , the modifications of the gyromagnetic moment of electrons and muons due to the minimal length have been discussed in ref .",
    "for a review of different approaches of theories with a minimal length scale and the relation between them , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , we study the effect of a minimal length in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics with a potential @xmath6 of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the particle mass ) .",
    "such a potential is singular when used in conjunction with the usual schrdinger equation .",
    "specifically , the condition of square integrability of the wave function does not lead to an orthogonal set of eigenfunctions with their corresponding eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hamiltonian operator is not self - adjoint @xcite ; to cure this illness , we must define self - adjoint extensions of the hamiltonian or equivalently require othogonality of the wave functions @xcite .",
    "however , the obtained spectrum is a peculiar one , as the energy eigenvalue may take values from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , so that there is no finite ground state .",
    "landau and lifshitz associate the occurrence of this infinite bound state to the classical fall to the center of the particle @xcite .",
    "in addition to this fundamental problem , the expression of the energy spectrum depends on an arbitrary phase parameter , coming from restoring the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian . for a review of works concerning this potential ,",
    "we refer the reader to refs . @xcite .    from a physical point of view , the strongly attractive @xmath12 potential is very interesting .",
    "indeed , the problem of atoms interacting with a charged wire , relevant to the fabrication of nanoscale atom optical devices , is known to provide an experimental realization of an attractive @xmath12 potential @xcite .",
    "it is a fundamental ( long range ) part of the potential describing dipole - bound anions in polar molecules @xcite , and has some applications in black holes physics @xcite . finally , let us note that the efimov effect in three - body systems @xcite arises from the existence of a long range effective interaction  @xmath6 of the form @xmath13 @xmath14 ( @xmath15 some constant ) , where @xmath16 is built from the relative distances between the three particles .",
    "further interest in the singular inverse square potential also arose from recent studies showing that it provides a simple example of a renormalization group limit cycle in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "we also mention for completeness sake other works on the regularization and the renormalization of this potential @xcite .    in this work we study in detail how the introduction of a generalized uncertainty relation regularizes the singular inverse square potential in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "we show , in particular , that the elementary length  included in these relations may be interpreted as an effective cutoff regularizing the potential at large momenta .",
    "it follows that in this new framework the existence of an elementary length regularizes the @xmath12 potential , without introducing any arbitrary cutoff .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we study the attractive @xmath17 potential in ordinary quantum mechanics , using the momentum representation . in section 3 , we derive the corresponding equations in quantum mechanics with a modified uncertainty relation . in section 4 , within the formalism of deformed heisenberg algebra , we solve exactly the schrdinger equation and extract the energy spectrum .",
    "some concluding remarks are reported in the last section .",
    "the singular attractive inverse square potential has been extensively studied in the coordinate representation ( see for instance case , perelo , george , scarf , wiliam ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the expression of the momentum wave function was given as a fourier transform of the wave function in configuration space .",
    "we use here a simple method for dealing with the attractive @xmath12 potential in momentum space , as first applied to the hydrogen atom potential @xcite .",
