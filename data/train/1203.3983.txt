    "<S> a portion of the electromagnetic wave spectrum between @xmath0 and @xmath1 terahertz ( thz ) suffers from the lack of powerful , effective , easy - to - use and inexpensive emitters , detectors and mixers . </S>",

    "<S> boron - nitride heterostructure which is able to emit radiation in the frequency range @xmath2 thz with the power density up to @xmath3 w/@xmath4 at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed device is extremely thin , light , flexible , almost invisible and may completely cover the needs of science and technology in the sources of terahertz radiation .    terahertz radiation , emitters , graphene , boron nitride .    a fast electron moves in a periodic potential @xmath5 with the average velocity @xmath6 , its momentum @xmath7 , as well as velocity @xmath8 , oscillates in time with the frequency f=.[fundamfreq ] since </S>",
    "<S> electrons are charged particles , such a motion is accompanied by an electromagnetic radiation with the frequency ( [ fundamfreq ] ) , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this physical principle is used in backward - wave oscillators and free - electron lasers , where the potential @xmath9 is produced by periodic in space electric or magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of radiation can be tuned in these devices by varying the accelerating voltage which determines the electron velocity @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> it was a long dream of scientists and engineers to create a compact solid - state emitter operating on the same physical principle . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xcite such an idea could be realized in semiconductor structures with a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas : placing a metallic grating in the vicinity of the 2d conducting layer and driving electrons across the grating stripes it seemed to be possible to force all electrons to emit electromagnetic waves at the frequency ( [ fundamfreq ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of the strong coherent emission at the frequency ( [ fundamfreq ] ) a weak thermal radiation at the frequency of two - dimensional plasmons f_p=[plasmafreq ] was observed @xcite ; here @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the charge , the effective mass and the surface density of 2d electrons and @xmath13 the dielectric constant of surrounding medium .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason of this failure was explained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the single - particle formula ( [ fundamfreq ] ) is valid only at @xmath14 , i.e. if the density of electrons is low or the drift velocity @xmath6 is sufficiently high . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is easily satisfied in vacuum devices and free - electron lasers . in a dense solid - state plasma one </S>",
    "<S> should take into account electron - electron interaction effects . </S>",
    "<S> then one finds @xcite that the strong coherent radiation is observed at the frequency f =- f_p[fundamfreqfull ] if the velocity @xmath6 exceeds a _ threshold _ value v_0>v_thf_pa_x= , [ threshold ] for details see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , at @xmath15 , electrons emit at the plasma frequency ( [ plasmafreq ] ) , just due to the heating of the system ( the thermal radiation ) .    the condition ( [ threshold ] ) is of crucial importance for successful device operation . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the surface electron density @xmath12 should be low and the drift velocity should be large . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is very difficult , if possible at all , to fulfil in semiconductor structures . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a gaas quantum well with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 m the threshold velocity ( [ threshold ] ) is about @xmath22 cm / s which is more than 4 times larger than the fermi velocity at the same density .    in graphene , a recently discovered @xcite only one - atom - thin , truly two - dimensional carbon material , the spectrum of electrons is linear , e_(*p*)=v_f[lin - spectrum ] with a very large , as compared to semiconductors , fermi velocity @xmath23 cm / s . </S>",
    "<S> this makes graphene an ideal candidate for the realization of the old idea to create a voltage tunable solid - state terahertz emitter , see illustration in figure [ parab - lin ] .     in order to accelerate a small amount of electrons up to velocities of order of @xmath23 cm / s one needs a large change of the momentum in the case of the parabolic energy dispersion ( semiconductors , left ) and a much smaller change of the momentum in the case of the linear energy dispersion ( graphene , right ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> however , an attempt to directly apply the above described ideas to graphene faces two difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> first , in graphene oscillations of the momentum do not lead to oscillations of the velocity and , hence , of the current , since the velocity @xmath24 is not proportional to the momentum . </S>",
    "<S> second , the condition @xmath25 restricts the required electron density by the values of order of @xmath26 @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known , however , that due to internal inhomogeneities ( electron - hole puddles @xcite ) the average density of electrons in a graphene sheet typically exceeds @xmath27 @xmath19 even at the dirac point .    </S>",
    "<S> the both difficulties can be overcome by using , instead of continuous graphene layers , an array of narrow stripes of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the following basic design of the emitter @xcite , figure [ genview ] . </S>",
    "<S> the first ( active ) graphene layer lies on a substrate made out of a dielectric material , e.g. sio@xmath28 or hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath29-bn ) , figures [ genview]a . </S>",

    "<S> another possible embodiment employing a single graphene layer is shown in figure [ genview]f . </S>",
    "<S> the periodic potential @xmath118 is produced in this case by the alternating stripe width @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of this design is that it employs only one graphene layer . in this case , however , the mean free path should exceed the grating period @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the ability to work as an emitter , the proposed device may also operate as a new type of a field - effect - transistor ( amplifier ) combined with a plane radiating antenna . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the intensity of the emitted radiation is determined by the amplitude of the ac electric current @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude depends , in its turn , on the voltage @xmath59 between the first and second graphene layers : if @xmath121 , the current flowing from the source to the drain does not depend on time and no radiation is emitted ; if @xmath122 , the current gets modulated and the device emits an electromagnetic signal . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation intensity can be very large ( @xmath123 kilowatts from square meter , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rad - power ] ) ) at the few - millivolt input signal @xmath59 ( see estimates above ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed device thus amplifies an input signal and sends it directly to the surrounding space within the same physical process .    </S>",
    "<S> the single - layer graphene absorbs only 2.3% of visible light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29-bn layer is a dielectric with a large band gap and is also transparent . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed powerful terahertz devices will therefore be very thin , light and practically invisible . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such few - nm thick devices can be bent up focusing radiation and producing a huge concentration of thz power in a very small spatial volume . to summarise </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a new type of few - atomic - layers thin , light , bendable , almost invisible and voltage tunable graphene based device which is able to produce a powerful electromagnetic radiation in a broad range of terahertz frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this device may cause a revolution in the terahertz science and technology and will have a lot of applications in many different areas . </S>"
