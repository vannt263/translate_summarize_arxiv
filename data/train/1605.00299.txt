    "dirac semimetals ( dsm ) are three - dimensional ( 3d ) analog of graphene , with point nodes in the bulk energy spectrum supporting low energy excitations with relativistic energy momentum relations resembling massless dirac fermions  @xcite . in principle",
    "they can arise at the quantum critical point between a 3d topological insulator and a conventional insulator with fine tuning of an external parameter .",
    "topological dirac semimetals are stable 3d electron systems with bulk dirac nodes protected by crystalline symmetries  @xcite . in dsm , owing to the simultaneous presence of time reversal and space inversion symmetries , the bulk energy bands are kramers degenerate locally at each @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the kramers degeneracy ensures that an accidental crossing between valence and conduction bands engenders a four - fold degenerate dirac node .",
    "such four - fold degenerate nodes in the bulk energy spectrum can be stable only in the presence of additional symmetries , such as uniaxial discrete crystal rotation symmetries @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this can be contrasted with three dimensional topological weyl semimetals ( wsm )  @xcite , where ( two - fold degenerate ) weyl nodes in the bulk energy spectrum are stable due to the existence of a non - zero chern number invariant associated with each weyl node . in dsm",
    "the simultaneous presence of time reversal and space inversion symmetry ensures that the chern number vanishes for each dirac node , which can in turn be thought as the superposition of a pair of weyl nodes with equal and opposite chirality .    in recent studies several materials",
    "have been theoretically proposed to be topological dsms  @xcite . on the experimental side , cd@xmath0as@xmath1   and",
    "na@xmath0bi  @xcite have been experimentally confirmed to support three dimensional bulk dirac nodes with linear energy spectrum . in this work",
    "we take a system with a pair of four - fold degenerate dirac nodes on a high symmetry axis ( which we choose as the @xmath6 axis as the axis of @xmath5 crystal rotation symmetry ) as a prototypical topological dsm .",
    "the recently discovered dsms , cd@xmath0as@xmath1 and na@xmath0bi , are both thought to be in this class .",
    "this class of dsms are topological because , since the dirac points appear on the high symmetry axis at @xmath7 , the @xmath8 plane can be considered as a gapped two - dimensional system with time reversal and space invariance symmetries , allowing the definition of a 2d @xmath9 invariant analogous to the 2d quantum spin hall insulator",
    ". additionally , since the system is invariant under a discrete rotation symmetry @xmath10 about the @xmath6 axis , which is responsible for the stability of the dirac points , one can define an additional integer topological invariant ( mirror chern number ) on the @xmath8 plane @xcite .",
    "the mirror symmetry appears here as a result of the combination of space inversion symmetry and @xmath11 rotation about the @xmath6 axis , which follows from the existence of the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "although topological dsms have certain non - trivial topological properties such as surface dirac fermions and zero energy fermi loops , topological thermoelectric response such as anomalous hall and nernst effects , which depend on non - zero momentum space integrals of berry curvature across surfaces in the brillouin zone , must vanish in the limit of zero magnetic field , because of the existence of time reversal symmetry . since anomalous hall and nernst conductivities arise from the transverse current response ( odd under time reversal ) to an applied longitudinal electric field and temperature",
    "gradient ( even under time reversal ) , independent of an applied magnetic field , it follows that the anomalous conductivities must vanish in systems that preserve time reversal symmetry .",
    "this can also be understood from the fact that the chern number of the dirac nodes in a dsm , which measures the flux of the berry curvature over closed surfaces around the dirac node , is identically zero , and thus , in the absence of a magnetic field , the net flux of the berry curvature vanishes everywhere in the brillouin zone . in the presence of a magnetic field , however , time reversal symmetry is broken , and topological dsms reduce to wsms , evincing anomalous hall and nernst response , superimposed over the conventional conductivities which must also be present because of a non - zero magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the nernst effect ( conventional as well as anomalous ) in topological dirac semimetals for small magnetic fields ( of the order of a few tesla ) and small chemical potential within the framework of boltzmann theory in the relaxation time approximation . in this limit",
    ", we find that the conventional nernst response is small due to sondheimer cancellation , and can be of either sign depending on temperature , but the anomalous nernst response is large and positive because of the peak in the berry curvature in the limit of small chemical potentials . at low temperatures , the behavior of the total nernst coefficient is characterized by an almost step like profile at @xmath2 .",
    "however , exactly at @xmath2 there is no nernst signal from either conventional or anomalous contributions , because of the restoration of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the measured nernst coefficient , thus , is dominated almost entirely by the anomalous nernst effect , at least in the limit of small temperatures .",
    "our results have direct experimental relevance for nernst and thermoelectric measurements on the available topological dirac semimetals cd@xmath0as@xmath1 and na@xmath0bi . for related work on thermoelectric response , although not for topological dsms with a pair of dirac points as appropriate for cd@xmath0as@xmath1 and na@xmath0bi , see ref .

    "[ fig_nernst_full ] , we plot the estimated nernst coefficient ( @xmath146 ) as a function of external magnetic field @xmath29 applied in the @xmath147 direction . as suggested by our previous discussion , the nernst response is primarily dominated by the anomalous contribution .",
    "this is further confirmed by our numerical results , where the conventional nernst coefficient was found to be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the anomalous nernst coefficient . at lower temperatures ( @xmath148 ) , the behavior of the nernst coefficient ( @xmath146 )",
    "is characterized by an almost step like profile at @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution of the flux of the berry curvature determines the anomalous hall conductivity @xmath137 . for @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and for @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "exactly at @xmath2 , one does not expect a finite @xmath137 , or a finite @xmath69 , as @xmath153 . as pointed out before , the sign of @xmath69 directly correlates with the sign of @xmath137 .",
    "three dimensional topological dirac semimetals are characterized by nodes in the bulk energy spectrum with a vanishing chern number . because of",
    "the vanishing flux of the berry curvature through any surface in the brillouin zone , anomalous hall and nernst conductivities vanish in a topological dsm in the absence of a magnetic field . in the presence of a magnetic field , however , a topological dsm reduces to a weyl semimetal , evincing a non - zero hall and nernst response , which have contributions from both conventional as well as anomalous ( berry curvature mediated ) components . in this paper",
    "we consider a topological dsm with a pair of dirac nodes on a high symmetry axis ( axis of four fold rotational symmetry , @xmath10 ) , which is an appropriate description of the experimentally realized dirac semimetal cd@xmath0as@xmath1 .",
    "for this system we compute the total nernst coefficient ( conventional as well as anomalous ) in the presence of a small finite magnetic field (  a few tesla ) and small chemical potential , within the boltzmann description in the relaxation time approximation . we find that the conventional nernst response is typically small due to sondheimer cancellation , and can be of either sign depending on temperature , small and negative at low temperatures ( @xmath154 k ) , and small and positive at higher temperatures ( @xmath155 k ) .",
    "in contrast , we find that the anomalous nernst response is large and positive because of the peaking of the berry curvature in the limit of small chemical potentials and due to the absence of sondheimer cancellation .",
    "our calculated anomalous nernst coefficient is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the conventional nernst coefficient at similar temperatures and magnetic field .",
    "the measured nernst coefficient , thus , is expected to be dominated almost entirely by the anomalous nernst effect , at least in the limit of small temperatures . at low temperatures , the behavior of the total nernst coefficient",
    "is characterized by an almost step like profile at @xmath2 .",
    "however , exactly at @xmath2 there is no nernst signal , from either conventional or anomalous contributions , because of the restoration of time reversal symmetry .",
    "our results have direct experimental relevance for nernst and thermoelectric measurements on the experimentally available topological dsms cd@xmath0as@xmath1 and na@xmath0bi .",
