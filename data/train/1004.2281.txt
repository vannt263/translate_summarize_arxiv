    "ever since the seminal paper of anderson and putnam @xcite , there has been a small industry devoted to computing topological invariants of tiling spaces . a key question throughout this effort has been `` what do these invariants actually mean ? '' put another way , if we determine ( say ) that the first cohomology of a 1-dimensional tiling space is @xmath5 \\oplus { \\mathbb{z}}$ ] , what does that tell us about the properties of tilings in that space ?",
    "progress has been made , relating tiling cohomology to gap labeling @xcite , to deformations of tilings @xcite , and to measures and patch frequencies @xcite . in this paper",
    "we continue this last direction of inquiry and show how the top - dimensional cohomology governs not only patch frequencies over an entire tiling , but the number of appearances of a patch in any finite region .",
    "the exact regularity property ( erp ) was defined in @xcite . in that paper , we considered one - dimensional substitution tilings with tile lengths chosen according to the left eigenvector of the substitution matrix , where the stretching factor @xmath6 is a pisot number of algebraic degree @xmath4",
    ". if the rank of the first rational ( ech ) cohomology of the tiling space is also @xmath4 , then the number of appearances of a patch @xmath7 in a return word is determined _ exactly _ by the euclidean length of the return word .",
    "the proof never used the condition that @xmath6 was a pisot number .",
    "it did rely on the tiling being 1-dimensional , and on the dimension of @xmath8 equaling the algebraic degree of the stretching factor .",
    "however , it is possible to rework the erp in much greater generality .",
    "[ general ] let @xmath9 be a @xmath1-dimensional tiling space , minimal with respect to the action of translations .",
    "suppose that @xmath10 for some integer @xmath4 .",
    "then there exist patches @xmath11 with the following property : for any other patch @xmath7 there exist rational numbers @xmath12 such that , for any region @xmath13 in any tiling @xmath14 , the number of appearances of @xmath7 in @xmath13 equals @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of appearances of @xmath17 in @xmath13 , and @xmath18 is an error term computable from the patterns that appear on the boundary of @xmath13 . in particular , the magnitude of @xmath18 is bounded by a constant times the measure of the boundary of @xmath13 .",
    "this has immediate implications for the existence of ergodic limits , and for the rate of convergence to those limits .",
    "[ ergodic ] suppose that a tiling space @xmath9 satisfies the conditions of theorem [ general ] , and suppose that the patches @xmath11 occur with well - defined frequencies @xmath19 .",
    "that is , the number of occurences of @xmath17 in any ball of volume @xmath20 , divided by @xmath20 , approaches @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath9 is uniquely ergodic , and the frequency of any patch @xmath7 approaches @xmath23 at least as quickly as the slowest of the @xmath17 s , or as @xmath24 , whichever is slower .",
    "in particular , a uniquely ergodic tiling space whose patch frequencies do not converge uniformly must have infinitely generated rational top cohomology .",
    "this theorem is in some sense dual to the results of @xcite , who study possible measures on tilings spaces by considering frequencies of ( possibly collared ) tiles and requiring that they satisfy a set of homological `` kirchoff s rules '' . knowing the ( co)homology of the tiling space then puts constraints on the possible invariant measures .",
    "when the tiling comes from a substitution , we can further sharpen our convergence estimates .",
    "let @xmath0 be a repetitive and non - periodic tiling derived from a primitive self - similar substitution .",
    "let @xmath25 be the matrix of the substitution .",
    "that is , @xmath26 is the number of times that the @xmath27-th tile type appears in the substitution of the @xmath28-th tile type .",
    "arrange the eigenvalues @xmath29 of @xmath25 in decreasing order of size .",
    "note that @xmath30 is real and positive , by the perron - frobenius theorem , and is strictly larger than @xmath31 .",
    "[ sub - rate ] if @xmath0 is a tiling as above , and if @xmath7 is any patch in @xmath0 , then there exists a constant @xmath32 such that , for any ball @xmath13 of sufficiently large volume @xmath20 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .    we obtain our strongest results when the tiling is 1-dimensional and comes from a substitution .",
    "let @xmath9 be a 1-dimensional tiling space coming from a substitution @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath9 can be expressed as an inverse limit space , and the cohomology of @xmath9 is usually computed this way @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xmath36 is finitely generated .",
    "the substitution @xmath35 maps @xmath9 to itself , and therefore maps @xmath37 to itself .",
    "this last action can be expressed by a non - singular @xmath38 integer matrix @xmath39 .",
    "( note : @xmath39 is typically different from the matrix @xmath25 of the substitution , but both matrices have the same leading eigenvalue , namely the stretching factor @xmath6@xcite . )    let @xmath40 be the minimal polynomial of @xmath39 , that is the lowest order monic polynomial for which @xmath41 , and let @xmath42 be the minimal polynomial of @xmath6 .",
    "we can then write @xmath43 for some integer polynomial @xmath44 .",
    "the polynomials @xmath45 and @xmath46 have no roots in common , so we can find a nonzero integer @xmath47 and polynomials @xmath48 and @xmath49 with integer coefficients such that @xmath50 .",
    "the smallest such integer @xmath47 is called the _ congruence number @xcite or reduced resultant @xcite _ of @xmath42 and @xmath44 .",
    "sequences of tiles in the tiling correspond to sequences of letters , also called words , where each letter designates a tile type . if the word @xmath51 occurs in the tiling , and if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is called a _ return word _ and the total length of the tiles corresponding to the letters @xmath53 is called a _ return",

    "then the frequency of @xmath7 takes the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a polynomial with integer coefficients , @xmath58 is the derivative of the minimal polynomial of @xmath6 , evaluated at @xmath6 , @xmath59 is the constant coefficient of @xmath42 , and @xmath47 is the reduced resultant of @xmath42 and @xmath44 .    in section [ background ] , we provide necessary background for understanding the proofs of these theorems . in section [ proofs ]",
    "we prove the four theorems , and in section [ examples ] we provide examples that illustrate how the erp works in practice .",
    "a square matrix @xmath39 with non - negative entries is _ primitive _ if all the entries of some power @xmath60 are positive .",
    "every primitive matrix has a largest positive eigenvalue @xmath61 , called the perron - frobenius eigenvalue .",
    "this eigenvalue has ( algebraic and geometric ) multiplicity one , and the corresponding left- and right - eigenvectors have strictly positive entries .",
    "all other eigenvalues are strictly smaller than @xmath61 in magnitude .    if @xmath35 is a tiling substitution with matrix @xmath25 , and if @xmath25 is primitive , then the relative frequencies of all tile types is given by the right perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath25 .",
    "the relative volumes of the tile types in a self - similar tiling are given by the left perron - frobenius eigenvector of @xmath25 .",
    "convergence of tile frequencies to their ergodic averages is governed by a power law . if tile type @xmath27 occurs with frequency @xmath21 , and if @xmath13 is a ball of volume @xmath20 , then @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the second - largest eigenvalue of @xmath25 , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are constants .",
    "the first term describes the error in counting @xmath27 s in a region obtained from a single patch by repeated substitution , and the second term describes the additional error from combining such regions into a ball .    a substitution @xmath35 _ forces the border _",
    "@xcite if there is an integer @xmath66 with the following property .",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are tiles in @xmath0 of the same type , then the patches @xmath69 and @xmath70 agree , up to translation , and their nearest neighbors also agree .",
    "if a substitution forces the border , then the tiling space is the inverse limit of the anderson - putnam complex @xcite , and all cohomology classes are generated by the duals to the vertices , edges , faces , etc .",
    "of this complex .",
    "if a substitution does not force the border , then we can define a new tile set using `` collared tiles '' @xcite .",
    "this rewriting yields a new substitution that does force the border , without changing the underlying tiling space .",
    "let @xmath25 be the matrix of a substitution and let @xmath71 be the matrix of the same substitution rewritten in terms of collared tiles .",
    "every eigenvalue of @xmath25 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath71 . if an eigenvalue @xmath72 of @xmath71 is not an eigenvalue of @xmath25 , then @xmath73",
    "this can be seen as folows .",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath68 are tiles of the same type , but are different as collared tiles , then @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the same ( up to translation ) as collections of regular tiles . viewed as collections of collared tiles , they can disagree only near the boundary .",
    "thus the differences between collared tiles of the same type can grow at most as @xmath74 .",
    "a 1-dimensional substitution is _ proper _ if every substituted letter has the same prefix , and every substituted letter has the same suffix .",
    "for instance , the substitution @xmath75 , @xmath76 is proper , in that all substituted letters start with @xmath77 and end with @xmath78 . in a proper substitution ,",
    "every substituted letter is a return word .",
    "it is always possible to rewrite a substitution to make it proper , without changing the underlying tiling space .",
    "this rewriting will change the substitution matrix , but the only eigenvalues that can appear or disappear from the rewriting process are zero and roots of unity .",
    "in particular , the perron - frobenius eigenvalue is unchanged .",
    "if a substitution is proper , then the first ech cohomology is the direct limit of the transpose of the substitution matrix @xcite    pattern - equivariant cohomology was first defined by kellendonk and putnam @xcite using differential forms , and then recast in @xcite in terms of cochains . here",
    "we consider rational pattern - equivariant cohomology using cochains .",
    "a @xmath1-dimensional tiling @xmath0 gives @xmath79 the structure of a cw complex , with the vertices serving as 0-cells , the edges serving as @xmath80-cells , the 2-dimensional faces as @xmath81-cells , and so on .",

    "this is an immediate corollary of theorem [ general ] . for any region @xmath13 of volume @xmath20 , let @xmath66 be the number of times @xmath7 appears in @xmath13 , and let @xmath16 be the number of times that @xmath17 appears .",

    "first suppose that the substitution forces the border .",
    "then the cohomology class of the indicator cochain of @xmath7 is a linear combination of indicator cochains of ( uncollared ) tiles .",

    "this tiling space also has @xmath246 , and the substitution , acting on cohomology , has eigenvalues 16 and 1 .",
    "however , in this example there _ are _ patches whose frequencies are not in @xmath241 $ ] . in particular , the letter @xmath77 occurs with frequency @xmath247 , while the letter @xmath78 occurs with frequency @xmath248 .",
    "theorem [ cylinder ] appears to be the strongest estimate that can be made using only the minimal polynomial of @xmath39 , or equivalently using the eigenvalues of @xmath39 ( and the size of any jordan blocks ) .",
    "however , as @xmath249 shows , we can sometimes obtain stronger estimates by studying the eigen_vectors _ of @xmath39 .",
    "the key is decomposing the cohomology class of an arbitrary indicator cochain into the sum of two pieces , one that is annihilated by @xmath150 and one that is annihilated by @xmath250 .",
    "although we can always do this using rational coefficients with denominator @xmath47 , some matrices @xmath39 allow us to do better .",
    "the theorems [ general][cylinder ] were stated in terms of the rational cohomology of the tiling space .",
    "this avoids complications relating to torsion and divisibility . however , there are times when integer - valued cohomology can be used more effectively .",
    "consider the 1-dimensional substitution on two letters @xmath251 , @xmath252 .",
    "this is an irreducible pisot substitution , with substitution matrix @xmath253 and stretching factor @xmath254 , which is the cube of the golden mean .",
    "the first cohomology is @xmath255 , with generators corresponding to the indicator cochains of @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "since every indicator cochain is cohomologous to an integer linear combination of @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 , every patch frequency is an integer linear combination of @xmath262 , @xmath263 , and @xmath264 , where we have chosen the tiles to have length @xmath265 and @xmath266 . in other words ,",
    "all patch frequencies are of the form @xmath267 , where @xmath268 and @xmath66 are integers .",
    "this is stronger than applying theorem [ cylinder ] with the return length @xmath269 , which only says that patch frequencies must be of the form @xmath270 .",
    "next consider a random 1-dimensional tiling @xmath0 , with two tile types , each of length 1 .",
    "we assume that the label of the tiles are chosen independently , with each tile having a probability @xmath221 of being type @xmath77 and a @xmath271 probability of being type @xmath78 . with probability one ,",
    "every finite word in @xmath77 and @xmath78 appears in @xmath0 , with a well - defined overall frequency given by the bernoulli measure .",
    "if @xmath221 is transcendental , then the frequencies of @xmath77 , @xmath240 , @xmath272 , etc .",
    "are all linearly independent over the rationals .",
    "this implies that the pattern - equivariant cohomology of @xmath0 is infinitely generated . and [ ergodic ] , since @xmath0 is not repetitive .",
    "however , @xmath0 being in the support of the bernoulli measure is an adequate substitute for repetitivity and unique ergodicity . ]",
    "if @xmath221 is algebraic , or even rational , then the pe cohomology is _ still _ infinitely generated , since the set of possible patches is independent of @xmath221 as long as @xmath273 .",
    "we have limited ourselves to one - dimensional examples so far because , in one dimension , it is possible to eliminate the error term in theorem [ general ] by choosing an appropriate return word . in two dimensions , that is usually much more difficult .",
    "however , some two - dimensional tilings , like the half - hex , admit regions whose boundaries are homologically trivial .",
    "another such example is the equithirds tiling , discovered independently by ludwig danzer ( unpublished ) and bill kalahurka @xcite .",
    "the equithirds tiling is a two - dimensional substitution tiling based on the substitution of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "each tile is either an equilateral triangle of side length 1 , or a 30 - 30 - 120 triangle with sides of length 1 , 1 , and @xmath274 .",
    "the equilateral triangle appears in two orientations , while the isosceles triangle appears in six orientations .",
    "all triangles have area @xmath275 .",
    "the isosceles triangles come in pairs , forming rhombi , and the equilateral triangles also come in pairs , also forming rhombi .",
    "the set of vertices of an equithirds tiling is a translate of the triangular lattice @xmath132 generated by @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "the unit cell of this lattice has area @xmath278 , or twice the area of a triangle .",
    "the vertices of first - order supertiles comprise a translate of @xmath279 , and vertices of @xmath66-th order supertiles comprise a translate of @xmath280 .",
    "the locations of @xmath66-th order vertices mod @xmath280 gives a map from the tiling space to the 2-torus , and the collection of all such locations gives a map from the tiling space to @xmath281 , which is topologically the product of two 3-adic solenoids .",
    "this map is a measurable conjugacy , and one might expect all patch frequencies to live in @xmath282$].$ ] rather than @xmath283 $ ] to emphasize that substitution corresponds to multiplication by @xmath284 , but of course the set of 9-adic rational numbers is the same as the set of 3-adic rationals . ]    this is not the case .",
    "each orientation of equilateral triangle , and each orientation of isosceles triangle , actually appears with frequency @xmath285 .",
    "overall , 3/4 of the triangles are isosceles , while 1/4 are equilateral .",
    "the appearance of a factor of 4 is analogous to the appearance of 1/3 in the patch frequencies of the thue - morse tiling .",
    "moreover , the patches shown in figure [ fig2 ] , and these patches rotated by multiples of 120 degrees , play a role analogous to return words . when substituted one or more times , the patterns on opposite legs of the rhombus match perfectly , as seen in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the term @xmath154 in equation ( [ chip ] ) vanishes when applied to a sufficiently substituted rhombus .",
    "this means that the number of appearance of any patch @xmath7 in a sufficiently substituted rhombus is determined exactly by the number of appearances of the control patches @xmath11 .    the equithirds tiling forces the border , which makes it easy to compute the cohomology @xcite using the methods of anderson and putnam @xcite .",
    "the answers are that @xmath286 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath287 \\oplus { \\mathbb{z}}^3 $ ] , hence @xmath288 , or @xmath289 .",
    "we can choose our control patches as follows .",
    "let @xmath198 be an equilateral triangle with horizontal base , let @xmath199 be the second rhombus shown in figure [ fig2 ] , and let @xmath204 and @xmath225 be rotated versions of @xmath199 .",
    "the frequency of each @xmath17 is @xmath285 , and every patch frequency lives in @xmath290 $ ] .    finally , it is possible to directly understand the various terms in @xmath291 .",
    "the patches shown in figure [ fig3 ] , obtained by substituting the rhombi of figure [ fig3 ] , are identical except in the very middle . substituting again yields even bigger patches that are identical except for one rhombus in the middle . taking a limit we obtain two tilings that agree completely except for that one rhombus .",
    "one of the classes in @xmath292 , represented by @xmath293 , measures the difference between these two tilings , and is invariant under substitution .",
    "likewise , @xmath294 and @xmath295 measure the same thing rotated by 120 and 240 degrees .",
    "each of these classes has trace zero .",
    "a fourth class , @xmath296 , counts area in units of @xmath297 , scales by 9 under substitution , and has trace @xmath298 .",
    "this corresponds to a generator of @xmath299 $ ] .",
    "these four classes span @xmath300 , but some indicator cochains can not be written as integer linear combinations .",
    "for instance , @xmath301 $ ] , so the trace of @xmath259 ( and likewise @xmath302 ) is @xmath285 .",
