    "solar granules , bright cells with darker borders , were observed with solar telescopes by the 1860s .",

    "these cells have widths of 100 mm or more , flow speeds of about 10 m s@xmath0 , and lifetimes of several months .",
    "yet another set of cells , mesogranules , were found by @xcite to be intermediate in size , flow speeds , and lifetimes between granules and supergranules .",
    "the advent of space based observations , with both continuous coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution , has enabled many new studies of solar convection .",
    "data from the michelson doppler investigation ( mdi ) on the esa / nasa solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) mission were analyzed by several groups .",
    "@xcite used a wavelet analysis on doppler , intensity , and magnetic images .",
    "they noted that granules dominated the radial flows while supergranules dominated the horizontal flows , but mesogranules were notably weak .",
    "( they also concluded that their wavelet analysis only captured about 30% of the signal . )",

    "we employ a new doppler data analysis tool to determine the toroidal component of the horizontal flows ( vortical flows with curl but no divergence ) .",
    "while the short ( compared to the 27-day solar rotation period ) lifetimes of supergranules suggest that solar rotation should not be a big influence on the flows , numerical simulations @xcite and observations @xcite indicate that the flows in supergranules have a preferred sense of vorticity in each hemisphere",
    ". this tendency should be stronger for the larger , slower cellular flows .    in the following section we describe the data and the data preparation .",

    "each doppler image is analyzed using the procedures described in @xcite and @xcite to measure and remove the doppler signals due to the axisymmetric flows ( differential rotation and the meridional circulation ) and the signal due to the convective blue shift .",

    "the convective blue shift is substantially altered in magnetic areas .",
    "uncorrected , this introduces doppler signals that are not directly related to actual flows on the sun s surface .",
    "we fit the convective blue shift signal , @xmath11 , to shifted legendre polynomials ( polynomials orthonormal with uniform weights on the interval @xmath12 ) with the dependent variable    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the heliocentric angle of a point from disk center .",

    "we calculate the three vector velocity components from this spectrum at an array of points with 4096 points equi - spaced in @xmath26 and 8192 points equi - spaced in @xmath27 .",
    "we then project these vector velocities onto the line - of - sight at each pixel in a 4096-by-4096 image of the solar disk as seen from 1 au .",

    "we also add , at each pixel , a convective blue shift signal that is a function of the heliocentric angle from disk center .",
    "this signal complicates the extraction of the doppler signal due to the meridional flow .",

    "a point - spread - function ( psf ) was developed to remove stray light from hmi data and is used here in the data simulation .",
    "first , a modulation transfer function ( mtf ) was obtained from ground - based calibration data using field stops @xcite in order to describe the pre - launch instrumental optics .",
    "we fit the mtf with an exponential convolved with the ideal optical transfer function ( otf ) , often known as a ` chat ' function .",
    "the exponential and ` chat ' function in the frequency domain are equivalent to a lorentzian and airy function in the spatial domain .",
    "post - launch data including solar aureole , lunar eclipse and venus transit events were used to evaluate how well the psf was able to reproduce the observed scattering .",
    "the final value of gamma ( the wavenumber exponent ) in the exponential function was determined through least squares fitting of the transit of venus data on 2012.06.05 from the side camera data .",
    "the final , non - ideal form of the mtf and subsequent psf was further modified for the following reasons .",
    "lunar eclipse images , where a large portion of the solar image is obscured by the lunar disk , enabled a measure of the large - scale scattering .",
    "one such eclipse occurred on 2010.10.07 and the hmi continuum intensity filtergram shows a light level of 0.34% of the disk - center continuum intensity for a position 200 pixels onto the lunar disk .",
    "we found that the light level tended towards a constant far away instead of continually decreasing with increasing distance from the solar limb .",
    "this motivated an additional term to be added to the psf to fit the tail of the distribution .",
    "if we only considered light scattered from 10@xmath37 away then the additional term would not be necessary , meaning that using only the venus transit data was not sufficient in order to emulate the large - scale scattering / dust on the optics .",
    "( note that the psf we developed differs from previous stray light removal efforts since we do not use a single gaussian or sum of gaussians as the central mathematical component . )",
    "deconvolved images were compared to the originals and it was found that the minimum intensity of a sunspot umbrae decreased from being 5.5% of the nearby quiet - sun continuum intensity in the original image to being 3.3% in the deconvolved image while the granulation contrast doubled , with a standard deviation of the intensity in the quiet - sun being 3.7% of the average in the original image and 7.2% of the average in the deconvolved image .    in our data simulation",
    "we average the line - of - sight velocity over all sub - pixels within a pixel that fall on the visible disk of the sun and then convolve that image with the psf found for the hmi instrument .",
    "this convolution is implemented by multiplying the fft of the image with the fft of the psf ( the mtf ) and then performing an inverse fft on the result .",

    "the mask edges are smoothed by convolving the mask with a cosine bell having a radius of 10 pixels .",
    "the masked data is then projected onto spherical harmonics by taking fourier transforms in longitude and legendre transforms in latitude to obtain complex spectral coefficients , @xmath39 , that reproduce the masked data when multiplied by the spherical harmonics and summed over @xmath1 and @xmath25 .",

    "the bottom of the spectral dip at @xmath44 represents cells with diameters of @xmath45 mm  a quoted size for mesogranules .",
    "we have forced the simulation spectrum to drop smoothly at low wavenumbers .",
    "while this leaves an apparent excess of power in the hmi data at wavenumbers below 30 , we attribute this signal excess to a less than perfect removal of the image artifacts .",
    "this is supported by the low wavenumber feature seen in the data when the artifacts are not removed ( dotted red line in figure [ fig : dopplervelocityspectra ] ) .",
    "the radial flow component represented by @xmath28 can be separated from the horizontal flow components using the method described by @xcite .",

    "we have compared our doppler velocity spectrum with the spectrum calculated from the three - dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations obtained using the stellarbox code @xcite , which takes into account the effects of ionization , sub - grid - scale turbulence , internal structure and chemical composition . for analysis we used a fully developed hydrodynamic run in a slab 80 by 80 mm in the horizontal , 25 mm in depth below the photosphere , and 1 mm of the atmospheric layer with the spatial grid resolution of 100 km . the photospheric velocity spectrum from this simulation ( shown in figure [ fig : compositevelocityspectrum ] by the blue line at high wavenumbers )",
    "is in very good agreement with the hmi doppler velocity spectrum in the range of the spherical harmonic degree from 200 to 4000 .",
    "however , the supergranulation bump is missing in these numerical simulations ( as it was in the simulations of @xcite ) .",
    "understanding of the origin of supergranulation is still a significant challenge in solar physics .",
    "origins based on the ionization of helium @xcite or the collective interactions between downdrafts @xcite now seem unlikely based on numerical simulations .",
    "the supergranules are imbedded in the sun s surface shear layer ( which extends to a depth of @xmath68 mm ) and are characterized by the magnetic network that forms around the periphery of each cell .",
    "perhaps their origin lies with the influence of the sun s rotation or magnetic field on these convective flows .",

    "<S> spectra of the cellular photospheric flows are determined from full - disk doppler velocity observations acquired by the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) instrument on the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) spacecraft . </S>",

    "<S> the amplitudes of these spectral coefficients are constrained by simulated data analyzed with the same procedures as the hmi data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the total velocity spectrum rises smoothly to a peak at a wavenumber of about 120 ( wavelength of about 35 mm ) , which is typical of supergranules . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum levels off out to wavenumbers of about 400 , and then rises again to a peak at a wavenumber of about 3500 ( wavelength of about 1200 km ) , which is typical of granules . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity spectrum is dominated by the poloidal flow component ( horizontal flows with divergence but no curl ) at wavenumbers above 30 . </S>",
    "<S> the toroidal flow component ( horizontal flows with curl but no divergence ) dominates at wavenumbers less than 30 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial flow velocity is only about 3% of the total flow velocity at the lowest wavenumbers , but increases in strength to become about 50% at wavenumbers near 4000 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum compares well with the spectrum of giant cell flows at the lowest wavenumbers and with the spectrum of granulation from a 3d radiative - hydrodynamic simulation at the highest wavenumbers . </S>"
