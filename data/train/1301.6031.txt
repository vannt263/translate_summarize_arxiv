    "we analyze the single - electron source of ref .   because it can operate in both adiabatic and non - adiabatic emission conditions .",
    "moreover it seems that its properties are well described by a non - interacting theory . @xcite",
    "that makes it possible to develop a relatively simple analytical theory which describes both operating conditions .",
    "we use a non - interacting model @xcite , in which the source consists of a single circular edge state , a fabry - prot cavity , weakly coupled to a linear edge state , which plays the role of an electron waveguide .",
    "this analytical model is in good agreement with actual experiments . in the weak coupling limit , the transparency of the quantum point contact connecting the cavity and the electron waveguide is small , @xmath1 .",
    "all relevant energies are smaller than the fermi energy , @xmath2 and the energy spectrum of electrons can be linearized in the vicinity of @xmath2 .",
    "that results in the equidistant spectrum of the cavity with level spacing @xmath3 defined by the time of flight , @xmath4 , around the circular edge state of the cavity .",
    "a metallic top - gate with potential @xmath5 periodically changes the position of the quantum levels in the cavity .",
    "we assume optimal operating conditions @xcite which require that the fermi level is positioned in the middle of two levels of the cavity and the gate potential changes with amplitude @xmath6 . in this case",
    "only one level crosses the fermi energy : when it raises above the fermi level an electron is emitted from the cavity into the waveguide , whereas when the level sinks below the fermi level an electron is absorbed by the cavity hence a hole appears in the stream of electrons within the waveguide .",
    "such a source generates no dc current and is often referred to as a quantum capacitor .",

    "therefore the dwell time sets a relevant time - scale of the problem under consideration .",

    "the delay between subsequent potential steps should be longer than the duration of a current pulse , @xmath19 , to allow an electron emission to be completed : the emitted charge @xmath20 should be equal to an electron charge , @xmath21 . at time",
    "@xmath22 a hole can be emitted .",
    "second , the dwell time , @xmath23 , defines the condition of adiabatic or non - adiabatic emission .",
    "if the potential @xmath5 changes fast on the scale of @xmath23 , then we speak about a non - adiabatic emission . in this case",
    "the shape of an emitted current pulse is asymmetric and given by eq .",

    "( b ) non - adiabatic emission : the cavities are driven by pulsed potentials and electron - hole pairs are emitted .",
    "since this pair is neutral , the time - dependent current is zero , @xmath40 .",
    "however , both the electron and the hole carry energy .",
    "because of the asymmetric shape of the pulses reabsorption can not be a time - reversed emission process .",
    "there is no absorption effect , the generated dc heat flow is not zero : @xmath41.,width=264 ]    on the other hand for some effects the shape of a wave - packet is crucial . as an example below we use the effect of reabsorption @xcite predicted for the adiabatic regime : if two cavities are coupled to the same edge state , then the electron emitted adiabatically by one cavity can be reabsorbed by another cavity emitting a hole at the same time , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",

    "@xcite this current consists of two parts , electron , @xmath42 , and hole , @xmath43 , which compensates each other : @xmath44 . to clarify whether it is merely a compensation effect or a reabsorption effect ,",
    "additionally the heat generated by the two cavities was analyzed .",
    "@xcite it was shown that each particle , either an electron or a hole , carries an excess energy ( over the fermi energy )    @xmath45     + this energy can be understood as the work done by the potential @xmath5 on the particle during its escape from the cavity .",
    "the particle starts to escape when its energy becomes equal to the fermi energy .",
    "the time it takes to escape is the dwell time , @xmath46 , given in eq .",

    "if two cavities emit an electron and a hole at different times , then these two particles together carry the energy @xmath49 .",
    "however , if an electron and a hole are emitted at the same time ( the time of flight between the cavities should be trivially taken into account ) then the extra energy flowing out of the system is zero.@xcite clearly this means that an electron emitted by the cavity @xmath50 and carrying an energy @xmath51 was reabsorbed by the cavity @xmath52 .",
    "this effect is paradoxical : on one hand , in fact , the hole emission is an electron absorption . on the other hand",
    ", the cavity @xmath52 can absorb any electrons in the waveguide passing it .",
    "why does it absorb the electron emitted by the cavity @xmath50 ?",
    "possibly this effect can be understood using time - reversal symmetry arguments .",
    "first , let us take only one cavity and let it emit an electron .",
    "after that let us reverse time .",
    "apparently the emitted electron will be reabsorbed .",
    "importantly , the portion of the wave - packet emitted last will be reabsorbed first .",
    "now let us take two identical cavities and let us drive them with potentials @xmath53 and @xmath54 related by the time - reversal symmetry , @xmath55 .",
    "note with such potentials if the first cavity emits an electron the second cavity emits a hole and vice versa .",
    "we can expect the second cavity to be an analogue of the time - reversal twin of the first cavity . to make such an analogy complete , the shape of the wave - packet does matter . because the second cavity will first reabsorb ( if possible ) the part of the wave - packet , which was emitted first .",
    "in contrast , the true time - reversal twin will first absorb what was emitter last .",
    "if the shape of a wave - packet is symmetric , as in the adiabatic emission regime , ( for the corresponding current pulse see eq .",
    "( [ pulse - a ] ) ) , then there is no difference between what was emitted first and what was emitted last . consequently the second cavity can play the role of the time - reversal twin and reabsorb what was emitted by the first cavity .    however , if the shape of a wave - packet is non - symmetric , as in the non - adiabatic emission regime , ( for the corresponding current pulse see eq .",
    "( [ pulse - na ] ) ) , then there is a striking difference between what was emitted first and last . as a consequence what the second cavity sees is different from what the time - reversal twin would see .",
    "therefore , adiabatic and non - adiabatic cavities work differently .",
    "as we show below , in the non - adiabatic emission regime both cavities emit together an electron - hole pair , which carries no charge , @xmath40 , but carries a non - zero energy .",
