    "hoava proposed a renormalizable theory of gravity in four dimensions .",
    "this is a non relativistic theory of gravity , which can be considered as a candidate for general relativity at uv scale @xcite .",
    "various aspects and solutions of this theory have been studied by many . by introducing a dynamical parameter @xmath2 in asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes ,",
    "a spherically symmetric black hole solution was first given by @xmath3 , mei , and pope @xcite .",
    "cai , cao , and ohta studied the general topological black holes in @xcite .",
    "in addition , kehagias and sfetsos have found a black hole solution in asymptotically flat spacetimes by choosing the dynamical parameter @xmath4 and introducing another parameter @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "park obtained a black hole solution for arbitrary values of the parameter @xmath5 and the cosmological constant @xmath6 , with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there are several studies on the thermodynamic and cosmological properties of black holes in hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity theory @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the area spectrum of a black hole in hl gravity .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    it is widely believed that horizon area of a black hole is to be quantized . in 1974 bekenstein proposed that the black hole area is equally spaced @xcite and the discrete spectrum was obtained as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the planck length and @xmath9 .",
    "bekenstein also proved @xcite that the black hole horizon area spectrum has a minimal spacing of @xmath10 . a method to quantize the horizon area",
    "was put forward by hod @xcite in which the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) were used . considering both quasinormal mode frequency and bohr s correspondence principle he found that the area spectrum is related to the real part of qnm .",
    "later kunstatter @xcite furthered this idea to find , the action @xmath11 is an adiabatic invariant , where @xmath12 is the real part of qnm frequencies , which leads to an equally spaced area spectrum .",
    "maggiore provided a new interpretation @xcite in which he proved that the physical frequency of qnm is determined by its real and imaginary parts and he derived the area spectrum which is in consistence with that of bekenstein . using these ideas ,",
    "there are several studies on the area spectrum of different kinds of black holes @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    recently majhi and vagenas @xcite proposed another method to quantize the horizon area without qnms . in their work",
    ", adiabatic invariant quantity connects to the hamiltonian of the black hole and using both hamiltonian and bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , they derived the equally spaced entropy spectrum of a spherically symmetric black hole .",
    "according to jiang and han @xcite , the adiabatic invariant quantity @xmath13 , used in @xcite is not canonically invariant and they suggested that by using the adiabatic invariant quantity of the covariant form @xmath14 , one can quantize the horizon area of a spherically symmetric black hole .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in this paper we adopt the methods suggested by majhi and vagenas and jiang and han to quantize the horizon area . therefore , by introducing the adiabatic invariant and using bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule , we determine the entropy spectrum and the area spectrum of a kehagias - sfetsos ( ks ) black hole in hl gravity .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we investigate the thermodynamics of ks black hole in hl gravity . the phase transition and stability of the black hole are discussed . in sect .",
    "3 , the entropy and horizon area quantization via adiabatic invariant and bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule are studied . finally , sect .",
    "4 ends up with a brief discussion and conclusion .",
    "hoava has used the adm formalism in which the four dimensional metric of general relativity is parametrized as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the lapse and shift functions , respectively .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath20 is the curvature scalar and @xmath21 is the extrinsic curvature that takes the form , @xmath22 here the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the time coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "the action of non - relativistic renormalizable gravitational theory proposed by hoava can be written as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 here , @xmath27 in which @xmath28 is the cotton tensor and it has the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 ,   @xmath31 ,   @xmath5 ,   @xmath2 and @xmath32 are constants .",
    "for spherically symmetric solution of hl gravity , let us consider the line element    @xmath33    substituting this metric ansatz in eq.([hl action ] ) and after angular integration , the lagrangian will reduce to @xmath34 where @xmath35    by giving @xmath4 and solving the field equations obtained from eq.([modified lagrangian ] ) , we can arrive at the ks solution @xcite , @xmath36    now we will investigate the thermodynamic aspects of ks black hole . in this section",
    "all quantities are expressed in the planck units(@xmath37 ) . from the condition @xmath38 ,",
    "the outer and inner horizons are given by , @xmath39 by considering @xmath40 from ( [ kshorizon ] ) we can establish a connection between mass of the black hole and its horizon radius as , @xmath41 from bekenstein - hawking area law , we can write @xmath42 hence , the horizon radius @xmath43 can be written in terms of entropy as , @xmath44 therefore , we can rewrite the mass - horizon radius ( [ masshorizon ] ) as @xmath45 as it is depicted in fig.[massentropy ] , the two horizons of the black hole merge at the point @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 ) @xcite . the same behavior is repeated for other values of @xmath5 with slight changes in @xmath48 values .",
    "thermodynamic quantities such as temperature and specific heat are defined respectively as ,    . ]    .",
    "@xmath49    @xmath50    then , from these equations , we can have the black hole temperature as @xmath51 and the heat capacity of the black hole as ,    . ]    . ]",
    "@xmath52    in fig.[tempentropy ] , variation of temperature with respect to entropy is plotted while in fig.[specentropy ] , the variation of heat capacity with respect to entropy for the different values of coupling parameter @xmath5 is plotted . in fig.[specentropy ] , there is a discontinuity in the plot , which shows that black hole may undergo a phase transition .",
    "heat capacity is an important thermodynamic quantity because from that we can tell about the stability of the black hole . from eq.([bhcks ] ) it is evident that the heat capacity is positive for a range @xmath53 .",
    "hence , a ks black hole is stable for this range of values of s.",
    "in this part of our work , entropy and horizon area of the ks black hole are quantized via the adiabatic invariance and the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule . by considering the properties of black hole such as adiabaticity and oscillating velocity of black hole horizon , we can write the action as @xcite , @xmath54 here @xmath55 or @xmath56 is the conjugate momentum corresponding to the coordinate @xmath57 or @xmath58 , respectively , and @xmath59 it is also to be considered that @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the horizon radius and @xmath63 is the euclidean time with a periodicity @xmath64 in which @xmath65 is the surface gravity which is given by , @xmath66    considering the hamilton equation @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the hamiltonian of the system , the integral given by eq.([adiabatic covariant action]),adiabatic covariant action can be evaluated by considering the contour integration over a closed path from @xmath58 ( outside the event horizon ) to @xmath69(inside the event horizon ) .",
    "the action given by eq.([adiabatic covariant action ] ) can be written as , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the horizon location before and after shrinking and @xmath73 is the oscillating velocity of black hole horizon . from the tunneling picture ,",
    "it is evident that when a particle tunnels in or out , the black hole horizon will shrink or expand due to the loss or gain of black hole mass @xcite . since tunneling and oscillation take place at the same time we can write @xcite , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the velocity of tunneling particle .",
    "since the two contour integrals in the eq.([adiabatic covariant action ] ) are equal we can write it as , @xmath76    to evaluate this adiabatic invariant quantity for the black hole in this discussion , let us consider the static spherically symmetric space time given by the line element ( [ lineelement ] ) ,    @xmath77    to euclideanize this metric , we consider the transformation in time coordinate @xmath78 .",
    "hence , @xmath79    let a photon travel across the black hole horizon , then from the radial null path , i.e. , @xmath80 , we can write @xmath81 from here onwards , our discussion will focus on the outgoing paths . from eq.([kssolution ] ) it is evident that @xmath82 , and thus , from eq.([radial null path ] ) we get @xmath83 the adiabatic invariant will be , @xmath84 using the near horizon approximation , @xmath85 can be taylor expanded to get , @xmath86 since there is a pole at horizon @xmath62 , we can consider a contour integral over a half loop going above the pole from right to left",
    ". using the cauchy s theorem , we can evaluate the integral in eq.([adiabatic invariant integral for ks ] ) to get @xmath87 where we have used the relation @xmath88 to connect temperature of the black hole with the surface gravity . according to first law of thermodynamics of black hole we can have ,",
    "@xmath89 therefore , @xmath90 from bohr - sommerfeld quantization @xmath91 the entropy spectrum is given by @xmath92 so the black hole entropy is quantized with a spacing of the entropy spectrum given by @xmath93 from bekenstein - hawking entropy relation @xcite , area spectrum can be found to be spaced as @xmath94 thus , we see that both entropy and area spectra of ks black hole are quantized and are equally spaced and they are independent of the black hole parameters .",
    "in this paper we have studied the quantization of entropy and horizon area of ks black hole in hl gravity using the method put forward by majhi and vagenas , which was later modified by jiang and han . the entropy and the area spectra are derived using adiabatic invariant and bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule and we have showed that both entropy and area spectra are equally spaced with a spacing of @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "eventhough the values of equispacing obtained in the present study are different from the values obtained using qnms approach for lmp black holes @xcite and ks black holes @xcite in hl theory , the equispaced property is maintained and their order of magnitudes are the same .",
    "majhi @xcite has used tunneling mechanism and qnms to study the entropy spectrum of ks black hole and found that though the entropy is quantized , the magnitude of equispacing obtained is different for the two methods .",
    "the results of the present study agrees with the result obtained through tunneling mechanism in @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy in the results may due to the fact that these methods are semiclassical .",
    "it is also found that the area and entropy spectra do not depend on the black hole parameters .",
    "we have also studied the thermodynamic aspects of ks black hole and found that they are thermodynamically stable @xcite for a certain range of values of the entropy .    .",
