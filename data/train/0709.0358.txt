    "the study of the galactic nuclei in early - type galaxies has played a fundamental role in our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "the arrival of high resolution instrumentation with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in the early 90 s opened a new window into the analysis of the nuclear properties of these systems .",
    "one of the major discoveries by hst in this respect is the _ apparent _ dichotomy in the nuclear structural properties of these galaxies ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "first highlighted by @xcite and soon after extended by @xcite , the core / cusp properties of early - type galaxies have been , and still are , under severe scrutiny by many groups around the world ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently the existence of a dichotomy has been questioned by @xcite from acs observations as part of the acs virgo cluster survey @xcite ( see also a. jordn contribution in these proceedings ) .",
    "the topic , however , is far from settled as illustrated by the numerous recent papers debating the existence of the two classes ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein for an in - depth discussion on the subject ) . independently of the debate , it is unquestionable that hst is the only current facility in the world that can allow us to revisit this issue.-2    almost in parallel to the progress made by hst , ground - based integral - field spectroscopy slowly started to emerge allowing us to look at galaxies in a different new way . with the first observations in 1999 , the ` sauron `  project @xcite has been one of the pioneers in the exploitation of this technology to study the kinematical properties of galaxies . in this contribution",
    "we made use of one of the latest results from our survey to connect the nuclear photometric properties of early - type galaxies with their overall level of rotation .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the results presented here is the matter of study in @xcite .",
    "there are 33 galaxies in the ` sauron `  sample of 48 elliptical and lenticular galaxies with known values for their inner profile slope , which separates them in `` core '' and `` power - law '' galaxies @xcite . from the point of view of their stellar kinematics ( see @xcite ) early - type galaxies appear in two broad flavours , depending on whether they exhibit clear large - scale rotation or not .",
    "we measure the level of rotation via a new parameter ( @xmath0 ) and use it as a basis for a new kinematic classification that separates early - type galaxies into slow and fast rotators in @xcite .",
    "we have defined the new quantity @xmath1 :      that measures the amount of specific ( projected ) angular momentum from the velocity maps .",
    "the parameter has been defined such that is insensitive to small features in the maps , and therefore provides a robust measurement of the global rotation .",
    "as we go from galaxies with low to high @xmath1 values , the overall velocity amplitude naturally tends to increase .",
    "more importantly , there seems to be a change in the observed stellar velocity structures .     versus absolute magnitude @xmath3 ( left panel ) and virial mass m@xmath4 ( right panel ) for the 48 e and s0 of the ` sauron `  sample .",
    "in both panels , symbols correspond to the inner slope classification @xcite with power - laws as open triangles , cores as filled squares , and crosses indicating galaxies for which there is no published classification .",
    "slow rotators are coloured in red and fast rotators in blue . ]    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show the distribution of @xmath1 as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath3 .",
    "the three slowest rotators ( ngc4486 , ngc4374 , ngc5846 ) are among the brightest galaxies in our sample with @xmath5  mag . other slow rotators tend to be bright but are spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude .",
    "most fast rotators are fainter than @xmath6  mag . in terms of core / cusp distribution , we find that most slow rotators are core galaxies while most fast rotators display power - law profiles .",
    "interestingly there are no core galaxies with @xmath7 , although the inclined core galaxy ngc524 would probably have a very high @xmath1 value if seen edge - on .",
    "the general behavior that core galaxies have lower @xmath1 than cusp galaxies is expected , since both classifications show trends with total luminosity , with brighter members tending to be core galaxies , and lower luminosity ones having power - law profiles @xcite . indeed ,",
    "all galaxies with @xmath7 have @xmath8 .",
    "it is important to notice though that there is not a one - to - one correspondance between the different photometric and kinematic groups , since we find both `` power - laws '' in slow rotators and `` cores '' in fast rotator .",
    "one can appreciate in the figure that there is a domain in luminosity and also in mass where both cusp and core galaxies coexist .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show the same trends but now as a function of the total mass of the galaxies . we have derived the mass values assuming it approximates to the virial mass derived from the best - fitting m@xmath9 relation presented in @xcite .",
    "the figure displays a trend with @xmath1 such that smaller values are found in more massive galaxies .",
    "the three slowest rotators are in the high range of m@xmath4 with values above @xmath10  m@xmath11 .",
    "there is a clear overlap in mass between fast and slow rotators for m@xmath4 between @xmath12 and @xmath10  m@xmath11 .",
    "however , all slow rotators , have m@xmath13  m@xmath11 , whereas most fast rotators have m@xmath14  m@xmath11 , lower masses being reached as the value of @xmath1 increases .    the lack of one - to - one relationship between the photometric and kinematic classes is probably highlighting the complex merging histories these galaxies go through in their evolution . based on the studies showing the incidence of gas in our sample @xcite ,",
    "it is likely that dissipation is one of the dominant factors in the way galaxies in the different classes evolve . in a forthcoming paper ( falcn - barroso et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we will combine hst and groung - based imaging with our integral - field observations to extend the analysis presented in this contribution , and to investigate in more detail the links between core / cups and slow / fast rotators in our sample of galaxies .",
