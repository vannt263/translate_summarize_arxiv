    "among simple extensions of the standard model ( sm ) are those with extra vectorlike fermions near the electroweak scale .",
    "vectorlike fermions can acquire masses independently of their yukawa couplings to the higgs boson and thus are not strongly constrained ( compared to chiral fermions ) by experiments .",
    "however , even small yukawa couplings between sm fermions and vectorlike fermions can affect a variety of processes , including higgs boson decays .",
    "we consider the extension of the sm with extra su(2 ) doublet , @xmath15 , and singlet , @xmath16 , leptons ( with the same hypercharges as sm leptons ) and their vectorlike partners .",
    "the mixing of new vectorlike leptons with leptons in the sm can generate flavor violating couplings of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 between heavy and light leptons . focusing on the couplings of the muon , the partial decay width of @xmath17 , where @xmath4 is the lightest new mass eigenstate",
    ", can be significant if this process is kinematically allowed .",
    "subsequent decays of the heavy lepton , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , lead to the same final states as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , thus possibly affecting measurements of these processes . since the partial width of @xmath18 is much smaller than @xmath19 in the sm , we mainly focus on @xmath5 .",
    "we calculate @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are sm leptons , including the possibility of off - shell decays , interference with @xmath11 , and the mass effect of @xmath10 which are important when the mass of @xmath4 is close to the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "we derive constraints on masses and couplings of the heavy lepton from the searches for @xmath20 at atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite .",
    "although our calculation is general and can be presented for any final state , we focus on the couplings of the muon and discuss possible effects on @xmath21 or @xmath22 from the region of parameters that can explain the anomaly in the measurement of the muon @xmath14 .",
    "it has been shown that the discrepancy between the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the sm prediction can be explained by contributions from extra vectorlike leptons  @xcite . a particularly interesting solution to the muon @xmath14 simultaneously explaining the muon mass completely from the mixing of the muon with vectorlike leptons",
    "requires the mass of the lepton doublet to be within about 130 gev  @xcite .",
    "thus in a large range of the parameter space this solution predicts the existence of @xmath4 below the higgs mass and thus @xmath17 could be kinematically open and potentially significant .",
    "the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 couplings needed to explain the muon @xmath14 anomaly are sufficient to modify the higgs decays in @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels .",
    "thus the contributions to the muon @xmath14 and @xmath12 can be connected without any further assumptions .",
    "the correlation with contributions to other higgs decays , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , can be also found in  @xcite .",
    "flavor violating higgs decays into pairs of sm fermions were previously studied in refs .",
    "these can also be induced by mixing of sm fermions with vectorlike fermions ; however , we do not consider this possibility here .",
    "we only allow one of the sm leptons to mix with vectorlike leptons in which case the flavor violating couplings to sm leptons are not generated .    in general , vectorlike quarks and leptons near the electroweak scale",

    "we extract bounds on @xmath31 and @xmath32 from atlas and cms searches , compare the atlas and cms limits on couplings and masses of the new lepton , and calculate the partial width of a scalar to four leptons in the presence of general flavor violating couplings of the new lepton .",
    "these formulas include the mass effects of final state leptons and interference with @xmath13 .",
    "we also briefly comment on the impact of constraints from @xmath33 which are typically weaker than those from @xmath34 , unless br(@xmath6 ) is close to 1 .",
    "we extend the sm by vectorlike pairs of new leptons , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath37 ) has the same quantum numbers as @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) in the sm , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is its vectorlike partner . for su(2 )",
    "doublets we use the same label for their charged components as for the whole doublets .",
    "we assume that the new leptons mix only with one sm lepton and we take the muon as an example .",
    "the results for the electron or tau lepton could be obtained in the same way .",
    "if the new leptons mix simultaneously with more than one sm lepton , the generated flavor violating couplings need to satisfy all the constraints from a variety of processes involving sm fermions .",
    "we will not pursue this direction here , and for simplicity we assume that all other couplings are zero .    with this assumption ,",
    "the most general renormalizable lagrangian for the muon and new leptons is given by : @xmath42 where the first term is the usual sm yukawa coupling , followed by yukawa couplings between the muon and vectorlike leptons , yukawa couplings between vectorlike leptons , and mass terms for vectorlike leptons .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath43 , the resulting mass matrix for the muon and the extra leptons can be diagonalized by a biunitary transformation : @xmath44 where we label the new mass eigenstates by @xmath4 and @xmath45 .",
    "couplings of the muon and heavy leptons to the @xmath2 , @xmath1 and higgs bosons are modified because the @xmath40 is an su(2 ) singlet mixing with other su(2 ) doublets , and the charged component of @xmath46 which originates from an su(2 ) doublet mixes with other su(2 ) singlets .",
