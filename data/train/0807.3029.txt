    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are among the best motivated candidates for explaining the cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "wimps appear in many interesting extensions of the standard model providing new physics at the tev scale .",
    "such is the case of supersymmetric models , in which imposing a discrete symmetry ( r - parity ) to avoid rapid proton decay renders the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) stable and thus a good dark matter ( dm ) candidate .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) provides two natural candidates for wimps , the neutralino and the ( left - handed ) sneutrino .",
    "the neutralino is a popular and extensively studied possibility . on the contrary ,",
    "the left - handed sneutrino in the mssm  @xcite is not a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "given its sizable coupling to the @xmath5 boson , they either annihilate too rapidly , resulting in a very small relic abundance , or give rise to a large scattering cross section off nucleons and are excluded by direct dm searches  @xcite ( notice however that the inclusion of a lepton number violating operator can reduce the detection cross section  @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a strong motivation to consider an extension of the mssm , the fact that neutrino oscillations imply tiny but non - vanishing neutrino masses .",
    "these can be obtained introducing right - handed neutrino superfields .",
    "several models have been proposed to revive sneutrino dm by reducing its coupling with z - boson .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a mixture of left- and right - handed sneutrino  @xcite , or by considering a purely right - handed sneutrino  @xcite . in the former , a significant left - right mixture is realized by adopting some particular supersymmetry breaking with a large trilinear term  @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism is not available in the standard supergravity mediated supersymmetry breaking , where trilinear terms are proportional to the small neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "recently , another realization of large mixing was pointed out  @xcite by abandoning the canonical see - saw formula for neutrino masses . on the other hand ,",
    "pure right - handed sneutrinos can not be thermal relics , since their coupling to ordinary matter is extremely reduced by the neutrino yukawa coupling  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these would be unobservable in direct detection experiments .",
    "another possibility to obtain the correct thermal relic density would consist of coupling the right - handed sneutrino to the observable sector , e.g. , via an extension of the gauge @xcite or higgs @xcite sectors    there is one more motivation to consider another extension of the mssm , the so - called `` @xmath2 problem ''  @xcite .",
    "the superpotential in the mssm contains a bilinear term , @xmath6 .",
    "successful radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) requires @xmath2 of the order of the electroweak scale .",
    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) offers a simple solution by introducing a singlet superfield @xmath0 and promoting the bilinear term to a trilinear coupling @xmath7 .",
    "after rewsb , @xmath0 develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of order of the electroweak scale thereby providing an effective @xmath2 term , @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the nmssm also alleviates the `` little hierarchy problem '' of the higgs sector in the mssm  @xcite and has an attractive phenomenology , featuring light higgses and interesting consequences for neutralino dm @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath9 symmetry of the nmssm may give rise to a cosmological domain wall problem , this can be avoided with the inclusion of non - renormalisable operators .",
    "motivated by the above two issues , we study an extension of the mssm where singlet scalar superfields are included @xcite . a singlet @xmath0 in order to solve the @xmath2 problem as in the nmssm ( and which accounts for extra higgs and neutralino states ) and right - handed neutrinos @xmath3 to obtain non - vanishing neutrino majorana masses with the canonical , but low scale , see - saw mechanism .",
    "terms of the type @xmath4 in the superpotential can generate dynamically majorana masses through the vev of the singlet @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the presence of right - handed sneutrinos , @xmath10 , with a weak scale mass provides a new possible dm candidate within the wimp category .    in this letter",
    "we analyse the properties of right - handed sneutrinos , showing that not only they can be thermally produced in sufficient amount to account for the dm in the universe because of the direct coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath3 , but also that their elastic scattering cross section off nuclei is large enough to allow their detection in future experiments .",
    "the superpotential in our construction is an extension of that of the nmssm , including new trilinear coupling among the singlets @xmath0 and @xmath3 and yukawa terms to provide neutrino masses .",
    "it reads @xmath11 where flavour indices are omitted and the dot denotes the @xmath12 antisymmetric product . as in the nmssm , a global @xmath9 symmetry is imposed , so that there are no supersymmetric mass terms in the superpotential . note that the term @xmath13 and @xmath14 are gauge invariant but not consistent with r - parity and thus are not included .",
    "we also assume no cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "once rewsb takes place and the higgs fields take non - vanishing vevs , @xmath15 , an effective majorana mass term in the neutrino sector is generated , @xmath16 .",
    "light masses for left - handed neutrinos are then obtained via a see - saw @xmath17 , which implies yukawa couplings @xmath18 of the same order of the electron yukawa .",
    "the sneutrino mass matrix can be read from the quadratic terms in the scalar potential as @xmath19 here , sneutrinos are decomposed in real and imaginary components as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and all parameters are defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , are the new soft parameters .",
    "these are assumed to be real for simplicity , so that the real and imaginary parts of sneutrinos do not mix .",
    "the mixing between left- and right - handed sneutrinos , induced by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , is proportional to the small neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath29 , and therefore negligible .",
    "note that @xmath30 splits the masses of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath32 is lighter than @xmath31 for @xmath33 and vice versa .",
    "although the right - handed sneutrino may have a non vanishing vev breaking r - parity spontaneously  @xcite , by solving the stationary condition we find that the origin @xmath34 is the true minimum if @xmath35 , which is precisely the condition for the lightest right - handed sneutrino mass squared  ( [ sneutrinomass ] ) to be positive .",
    "hereafter we only consider cases where this condition is satisfied .",
    "in such a case , the higgs potential coincides with that in the nmssm .    the coupling between a higgs boson , @xmath36 , and two right - handed sneutrinos determines most of the sneutrino phenomenological properties .",
    "it can be calculated from the superpotential and lagrangian and reads @xmath37\\hcompis \\ , ,    \\label{csnsn } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the elements of the higgs diagonalisation matrix .",
    "the right - handed sneutrino , having a mass of order the ew scale , can be the lsp in our construction for adequate choices of the input parameters ( in particular , for small @xmath40 ) .",
    "in such a case , it constitutes a good candidate for dm . in order to determine its viability , its thermal relic abundance , @xmath41 , needs to be calculated and compared to the wmap result , @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the possible products for @xmath43 annihilation include    * @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 via @xmath47-channel higgs exchange ; * @xmath48 , via @xmath47-channel higgs exchange , @xmath49- and @xmath50-channel sneutrino exchange , and a scalar quartic coupling ; * @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , via @xmath47-channel higgs exchange , and a scalar quartic coupling ; * @xmath53 and @xmath54 via @xmath47-channel higgs exchange ; * @xmath55 , via @xmath47-channel higgs exchange and via @xmath49- and @xmath50-channel neutralinos exchange .",
    "the processes suppressed by the neutrino yukawa @xmath29 , e.g. , those involving @xmath5 exchange along an @xmath47-channel , are negligible and have not been taken into account .",
    "notice that similar models where the higgs sector is extended share some of these channels @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the annihilation cross section is very dependent on the structure of the higgs sector . in particular",
    ", all the processes involve @xmath47-channel higgs exchange , which implies the presence of rapid annihilation in the resonances , when @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , annihilations into a neutral higgs pair turn out to be one of the dominant channels , implying a significant decrease in @xmath41 when @xmath57 .",
    "this is interesting , since very light higgses are possible ( as long as they have a significant singlet component ) in the nmssm .",
    "another important contribution comes from the annihilation into a pair of right - handed neutrinos when @xmath58 .    in our calculation",
    "we do not include coannihilation effects . for our choice of parameters and in wide regions of the nmssm these are only important in the regions in which the lsp changes from sneutrino to neutralino and do not affect our conclusions .",
    "our input parameters are , on the one hand , the usual nmssm degrees of freedom , @xmath59 , which we define at low - energy .",
    "regarding the soft parameters , we assume that gaugino masses mimic , at low - energy , the values obtained from a hypothetical gut unification .",
    "low - energy observables , such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment and br(@xmath60 ) , pose stringent constraints on the nmssm parameter space . in order to avoid these",
    ", we consider an example with @xmath61  gev , @xmath62  gev , @xmath63  gev , @xmath64  gev @xmath65  gev , @xmath66  gev , @xmath67 , @xmath68  gev and @xmath69 , that was studied in  @xcite ( see fig.7 there ) .",
    "the choice @xmath70 and @xmath71 corresponds to a very characteristic point of the nmssm , featuring a very light higgs mass , @xmath72  gev ( compatible with lep bounds due to its large singlet component ) , and a lightest neutralino with @xmath73  gev ( which sets the upper limit for @xmath74 as the lsp ) .",
    "the masses of the remaining two scalar higgses are @xmath75  gev and @xmath76  gev .",
    "the pseudoscalar masses in this example are @xmath77  gev and @xmath78  gev , where the lightest pseudoscalar also has a significant singlet composition .",
    "finally , the resulting mass of the charged higgs is @xmath79  gev . the viability of this set of nmssm parameters is checked with the nmhdecay  2.0 code  @xcite , based on which we have built a package which calculates the sneutrino relic density using the numerical procedure described in @xcite .",
    "our model contains three new parameters to be fixed , @xmath80 . in order to illustrate the theoretical predictions for @xmath41 we set @xmath81  gev and vary @xmath82 and @xmath40 in the ranges @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 $ ]  gev , respectively , excluding those points in which @xmath74 is not the lsp or is tachyonic .",
    "the resulting @xmath41 is shown in fig.[fig : relic ] , where the large suppression on the higgs resonances for the two lightest higgses is clearly evidenced ( the resonance corresponding to the heaviest scalar higgs would be located at @xmath85  gev and is therefore not accessible in the region where the sneutrino is the lsp in the present example ) .",
    "the relic abundance increases as @xmath82 decreases due to the reduction in @xmath86 .",
    "remarkably , the correct relic density can be obtained with natural values of @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , when annihilation into higgses is possible ( @xmath87 ) , one needs @xmath88 .",
    "notice also that very light @xmath74 are viable with @xmath89 through the annihilation into @xmath90 . for our choice of parameters",
    "a lower bound @xmath91  gev is obtained .",
    "the direct detection of sneutrinos would take place through their elastic scattering with nuclei inside a dm detector . at the microscopic level",
    ", the low - energy interaction of sneutrinos and quarks can be described by an effective lagrangian . in our case , there is only one contribution ( at tree level ) to this process , the @xmath49-channel exchange of neutral higgses . in terms of the higgs - sneutrino - sneutrino coupling ,",
    "one can write @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the corresponding quark yukawa coupling and @xmath94 labels up - type quarks ( @xmath95 ) and down - type quarks ( @xmath96 ) . the effective lagrangian contains no axial - vector coupling since the sneutrino is a scalar field , thus implying a vanishing spin - dependent cross section .    the total spin - independent sneutrino - proton scattering cross section yields @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the proton mass and the expression for @xmath99 in terms of the hadronic matrix elements parametrizing the quark content of the proton can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the scattering cross section is also very dependent on the features of the higgs sector . in particular",
    ", @xmath100 becomes larger when @xmath86 ( [ csnsn ] ) increases ( e.g. , when @xmath101 , @xmath82 or @xmath25 are enhanced ) and/or the mass of the lightest cp - even higgs decreases .",
    "the theoretical predictions for @xmath102 are represented as a function of the sneutrino mass in fig.[fig : sncross ] .",
    "the sneutrino fractional density @xmath103 , is defined to be @xmath104 $ ] in order to have a rescaling of the signal for subdominant dm in the halo  @xcite .",
    "black dots correspond to points with a relic density consistent with the wmap results , whereas grey dots stand for those with @xmath105 in which @xmath74 is subdominant .",
    "the right - handed sneutrino in our model is not yet excluded by direct searches for dm .",
    "interestingly , the predicted @xmath100 lies within the reach of projected detectors , such as supercdms and xenon1 t ( unlike a pure right - handed sneutrino with only yukawa interactions ) .    regarding the possible indirect detection of this wimp candidate , notice that not being a majorana fermion , contrary to the neutralino case , sneutrino annihilation into a @xmath106 pair would not be helicity suppressed .",
    "thus it can potentially lead to larger signals ( as in the case of kaluza - klein dark matter ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the detectability of these signals will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we propose the right - handed sneutrino as a viable thermal dm candidate in an extension of the mssm where the singlet superfields , @xmath0 and @xmath3 , are included to solve the @xmath2 problem and account for neutrino masses .",
    "a direct coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath3 provides a sufficiently large annihilation cross section for the right - handed sneutrino , as well as a detection cross section in the range of future direct dm searches .",
