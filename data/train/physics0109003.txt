    "the signal of a new nature were first detected in a run of experiments of 1994 - 1996 , carried out with the aid of a modernized high - precision quartz gravimeter `` sodin '' and a magnet attached to it [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the signal appeared as permanent smooth peak - shape pulses with duration from 2 to 10min . and",
    "with amplitudes up to @xmath0 15l ( l is the amplitude of the moon tide ) .",
    "the experiments were carried out within a special box of the gravimetric laboratory of ssai msu , in a basement room at a level of 2 meters underground .",
    "the duration of the uninterrupted experiment was no more than 30 days .",
    "besides the last peak ( 19.04.96 ) , all results were obtained on the basis of one gravimeter measurements . in the last experiment",
    "two gravimeters were used .",
    "they were positioned on the same base in the box : one of the them was with a magnet , the other ( reference one ) was without magnet .",
    "both gravimeters were connected to the same power network but had separated stabilized power sources .    in the experiment with two gravimeters , that with magnet detected an anomalous event which was not fixed by the gravimeter without magnet .    since the procedure of investigating the signal of new nature with the aid of two gravimeters was of short - term duration ( and the main results were obtained by one gravimeter ) , the run of experiments in 1994 - 1996 could be considered only as preliminary one .",
    "nontheless , it should be noted that the signals ( 12 peaks ) were concentrated in space around some stellar direction having the following coordinates in the second equatorial system : right ascension @xmath2 , declination @xmath3 .",
    "this was nearly coincident with some chosen spatial direction found in the course of investigating the assumed new anisotropic interaction with the aid of a torsion balance arranged inside high - current magnets [ 3 - 8 ] as well as when observing time changes in the intensity of the @xmath4-decay of radioactive elements [ 3,4,9 - 10 ] in the process of their rotation together with the earth .",
    "the new run of experiments was aimed at more precise measurements owing to elimination of technique errors of the preceding investigations .",
    "in the run of experiments of 1999 - 2000 , the method of two gravimeters with a magnet attached to one of them , was used .",
    "the gravimeters were positioned in an underground gravimetric laboratory of ssai msu , at a depth of @xmath0 10 m , on a special base separated from the foundation of the building .",
    "a recently made stabilized power system could feed the gravimeters also in a case of accidental power switching off during @xmath0 2hs .",
    "the information from gravimeters was transmitted to a personal computers ( pc ) .    a schematic diagram of a quartz sensitive system is shown in fig.1 .",
    "its main component is a quartz lever 1 ( 2 cm in length with a platinum mass of _ m = 0.05 g _ ) suspended on torsion quartz fibres 2 and additionally off - loaded by a vertical quartz spring 3 .",
    "such a construction gives to the device the high sensitivity to changes in gravity up to 1_@xmath5gal _",
    "( @xmath6_ms_@xmath7 is the free fall acceleration ) as well as sufficient protection against microseismic disturbances .",
    "the optical recording system comprises a galogen lamp 4 fed from a high - stabilised power source , light of which lamp enters into the instrument through the objective lens 5 with the aid of optical fibers .",
    "the quartz rod 6 welded to the level is a cylindrical lens , it forms an image of the point light source , which falls further on a photosensor rule 7 with a sensitivity on the order of 1@xmath5 m .",
    "the digital signal from the photosensor rule output enters further through a special interface to a computer pc which executes preliminary processing and averaging of data over the interval of 1 min .",
    "the accuracy of minute s data is @xmath8 depending on the microseismic noise level varying considerably in the course of day .",
    "the sensitive system of the instrument includes some additional units ( not shown in fig.1 ) protecting it from thermal , electrostatic , and atmospheric pressure disturbances .",
    "calibration of the instrument is carried out by the inclination procedure with an accuracy of about @xmath9 which is quite sufficient for the experiment being considered .",
    "the amplitude of constantly recorded by the device changes in gravity due to moon - sun tides and corresponding earth s deformation , is @xmath10 which allows to evaluate magnitudes of possible anomalous effects against the background of tides .    to measure the new interaction by the sodin gravimeter , a constant magnet ( 60 mm in diameter , @xmath11 mm in height , the field b in the centre of @xmath12 ) was attached to it in such a way that the vector potential lines of the magnet in the vicinity of a test platinum weight ( see fig.1 ) were directed perpendicular to the earth s surface .",
    "the magnet played the role of a peculiar amplifier of the new force ( see in detail refs . [ 3,4 ] ) .",
    "to illustrate the experiment , in figs.2 - 6 some temporal fragments of recording of the gravimeters are shown .",
    "they demonstrate smooth peak - form overshoots by the `` sodin '' gravimeter s209 with the attached constant magnet .    at the first stage of experiments ,",
    "the gravimeter with the magnet and the reference gravimeter worked on different time scales ( moscow ( msk ) and greenwich ( utc ) time , respectively ) .",
    "therefore a shift of the curves is seen in figs.2,3 which corresponds to that of time zones ( i.e. 3hs ) .",
    "it is seen from the figures that the amplitudes of overshoots are in some cases ( figs.4,5 ) much superior to the amplitude of the moon tide . in february - march 2000",
    ", the overshoots corresponded to an increase in the gravitational effect , in may - june on the contrary to its decrease .    as opposed to the experiments of 1994 - 1996 in which the duration of the peaks was various ( from 2 to 10 min .",
    "and more ) , the peak length in consideration was practically constant and equaled 2 - 3 min .    in table 1 presented are all anomalous deflections recorded by the gravimeter with magnet and not fixed by the reference gravimeter without magnet .",
    "consider in detail an experimental fragment shown in fig.6 .",
    "as is seen , the events 1,3,4 corresponding to local earthquakes are neatly coincident in the recordings of both gravimeters , but the event 2 was fixed only by the gravimeter with magnet .",
    "as was said above , the instruments in the course of the experiment were arranged on the base separated from the foundation of the building , at a depth of @xmath0 10 m . therefore , as is clearly seen from fig.6 , various earth s oscillations acted identically onto both gravimeters .",
    "their design gives them good protection against thermal , electrostatic , and barometric disturbances .",
    "the gravimeters were powered from the same network , therefore , if some disturbance of `` unknown nature '' could pass through it that would manifest itself in both readings .",
    "the possible `` jumps '' in quartz occurring sometimes when using the gravimeters `` sodin '' have quite different form and can not explain the nature of the smooth minute s peaks fixed in the experiment .",
    "the result obtained also can not be explained by noise in the computers , because during the long use of them before the run of experiments of 1994 - 1996 as well as in other experiments carried out in 2001 , such peaks were not observed .",
    "the outer electromagnetic noise was practically minimum and , which is the main , that would uniformly tell on both gravimeters .",
    "one can not also explain the obtained results by the influence on the gravimeter of various hypothetical particles predicted in modern calibration theories ( like axions , photinos , gravitinos , etc . )",
    "[ 11,12 ] since both gravimeters are equal for their properties .",
    "in table 1 shown are the times of detection of the peaks by the gravimeter with magnet during the first half - year 2000 as well as times of corresponding events in the sun with indication of character of the event and the observatory from which the information was obtained .",
    "the more complete information about the solar events accompanying the peaks can be found in refs . [ 13 ] .            according to recent investigations of anisotropic properties of the new force presented in ref.[14 ] , this force is directed at each point of space over a cone with the opening of @xmath14 formed around the vector * a*@xmath1 with the coordinates @xmath15 the results of [ 14 ] are in good agreement with [ 15 ] .",
    "the force can act also in direction of * a*@xmath1 if an object being acted upon has a closed circular current .",
    "this was observed in experiments on investigating changes in the intensity of @xmath4-decay of radioactive elements [ 15 ] .",
    "an analysis of the experimental material presented here has shown that all events in table 1 ( except ( 2 ) in fig.6 ) corresponded to such observation time when the direction of a normal to the surface of the earth ( i.e. the direction of the maximum sensitivity of the gravimeters ) was coincident ( to a precision of @xmath16 ) with the generator of above said cone .",
    "the time of the event ( 2 ) in fig.6 indicates the direction of the normal to the earth s surface coincident ( to @xmath17 ) with the coordinates of the vector * a*@xmath13 itself : @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( i.e. with the axis of the cone ) .",
    "thus the experiments carried out with the use of two gravimeters have confirmed the earlier results obtained with the aid of only one gravimeter with an attached magnet .",
    "their results ( the direction of the new force ) are coincident with those of the experiments on investigating the anisotropic properties of space with the aid of plasma generators as well as the changes in intensity of the @xmath4-decay of radioactive elements .",
    "the authors are grateful to participants of the seminar at the astrocosmic center of the physical institute of ras and personally to prof .",
    "v.v.burdyuzsa for a fruitful discussion of the experimental results , as well as to e.p.morozov , l.i.kazinova , a.yu.baurov for the help in preparation of the text of the paper .",
