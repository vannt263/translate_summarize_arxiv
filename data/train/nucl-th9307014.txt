    "in this paper we use the kerman - klein method @xcite to derive a microscopic core - particle model .",
    "this method is based on heisenberg matrix mechanics , where exact eigenstates are used , but the matrix elements of operators are the unknown quantities . in principle",
    "the formalism gives the same results as the schrdinger equation .",
    "in practical approximations the method leads to interesting approximate models .",
    "especially when some matrix elements are known experimentally , we can construct models that are a hybrid between a phenomenological and microscopic model . in the case of core - particle coupling",
    "such an approach has been introduced by dnau and frauendorf .",
    "we study the usefulness of this approach in a serious numerical application to the rotational nuclei @xmath0gd , and extend the method to calculations of transition strengths .    our calculations , restricted to deformed nuclei in the current application ,",
    "generalize the particle rotor model , and we shall compare our results to those of less microscopic calculations using this model .",
    "the model , first introduced by bohr and mottelson @xcite , has been used for the study of both low and high spin states of weakly and strongly deformed nuclei . for the past three decades",
    "it has continued to provide a framework for the analysis of the rotational band structure of odd nuclei . in spite of its approximate nature",
    ", it has been used successfully to explain both the structure of deformed and transitional nuclei @xcite .    in its most primitive version one couples a single particle to a rotating ( even - even ) rigidly deformed core .",
    "the coupling of the single particle to the core is generally approximated by a deformed nilsson potential . due to the rotation",
    "there is also a coriolis interaction between the total angular momentum of the system and the single - particle angular momentum . in later applications",
    "one finds extensions of the original model ( we shall use calculations for @xmath0gd as references throughout the discussion ) .",
    "the nilsson potential can be replaced by a more realistic deformed woods - saxon potential @xcite , pair correlations can be taken into account by a quasi - particle transformation of bcs type @xcite , and mixing between different major shells ( states with principal quantum number @xmath2 differing by two ) @xcite can be included .",
    "finally one can allow for phonon excitations of the core @xcite , in contrast with the standard core - particle coupling model ( cpc model ) where the core is assumed to be a rigid rotor .",
    "even these extended models often suffer from an inadequacy , the so called coriolis attenuation problem . in order to reproduce the experimental energy spectra ,",
    "the coriolis matrix elements have to be reduced by up to @xmath3 .",
    "this problem has been studied extensively over the years .",
    "many physical effects previously omitted in the model have been invoked as the cure for this disease : the proper treatment of the two body recoil effect @xcite , the inclusion of octupole degrees of freedom @xcite , and the use of an angular - momentum dependent moment of inertia and pairing gap @xcite .",
    "a more complete list of all possible suggested causes is given in ref .",
    "it is quite conceivable that one needs to combine several of these extensions to eliminate this problem .",
    "as yet , however , no clear consensus has emerged concerning the source of the attenuation problem .    in the present paper",
    "we adopt the kerman - klein approach , emphasizing the steps required in the transition between a strict microscopic approach and one which contains compromises aimed at making applications easier to carry out . in effect we shall trace the steps of dnau and frauendorf in their core - quasiparticle coupling model @xcite . in their work a simple pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole separable interaction hamiltonian was considered .",
    "only a few application of this type exist , see refs .",
    "@xcite and the review in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our work",
    "we also introduce mixing between states with @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the principal quantum number .",
    "we believe that the pursuit of a microscopic approach will lead to a more complete cpc , and give some insight into the problems of phenomenological cpc models .",
    "in addition the microscopic basis allows for the straightforward inclusion of different effective interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we discuss the basis of the model . first we describe briefly the basis of the kerman - klein method and then summarize the dnau - frauendorf modifications @xcite .",
    "we then turn to the application of a slightly extended form of the dnau - frauendorf formulation to the nuclei @xmath0gd .",
    "these form an excellent testing ground for our model since extensive calculations have been performed for these nuclei",
    ". there also exists a body of recent experimental data on the transition strengths that has not yet been explored sufficiently @xcite .",
    "finally , in the last section , we give a review of the other theoretical descriptions available for these nuclei , and compare our results with these previous efforts .",
    "the kerman - klein method was introduced in the early sixties @xcite to provide a rotationally invariant description of deformed nuclei in the framework based on the equations of motion ( eom ) . among many applications ,",
    "it was applied to a study of the foundations of core - particle coupling models @xcite .",
    "overall it has been applied to various nuclear many - body problems @xcite as well as to field theories @xcite .",
    "here we use it as the starting point to derive and extend the cpc model .",
    "as has been stated in the introduction , one of the major difficulties with the cpc model is the coriolis attenuation problem .",
    "we believe that the kerman - klein method may be a good starting point for an investigation of this problem .",
    "the method starts from a shell model hamiltonian and provides expressions for the properties of low - lying collective states of an odd - mass nucleus and its even - even neighbors .",
    "these expressions include the energy eigenvalues , the single - particle coefficients of fractional parentage ( cfp ) and matrix elements of the electromagnetic operators . in practice ,",
    "hamiltonians with only simple ingredients have been studied ( in the simplest case single particle hamiltonian plus monopole pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions ) , and only relatively few low - lying collective states in the even cores have been included ( in the simplest case only the ground - state rotational band ) .",
    "since the hamiltonian must include expressions for both the long - range part and the short - range part of the nuclear force , we start with a hamiltonian containing multipole expansions involving particle - hole as well as particle - particle contributions . this separation simplifies the application of the eom method .",
    "we thus write @xmath5 here @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are the spherical single particle energies , the operator @xmath9 is the particle - hole multipole operator , @xmath10 _ { m_{l}}^{l } , \\ ] ] and @xmath11 is the particle - particle multipole operator    @xmath12 _ { m_{l}}^{l } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath13 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients and @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath15 are the particle - hole matrix elements    @xmath16    and @xmath17 the particle - particle matrix elements @xmath18    the task we set ourselves is to obtain equations for the states and energies of the odd nucleus assuming that the properties of the even nuclei are known .",
    "the states of the odd nucleus ( particle number @xmath2 ) are designated as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes all quantum numbers beside the angular momentum @xmath21 and its projection @xmath22 .",
    "the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the neighboring even nuclei with particle numbers ( @xmath23 ) are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , where @xmath26 plays the same role for even nuclei as @xmath20 does for the odd nuclei .",

    "the fundamental practical problem is to find a suitable ` collective ' subspace of the complete hilbert space .",
    "we assume that this ` collective ' subspace decouples from the remaining states , at least approximately .",
    "this requires that any matrix element of the relevant multipole operators between a collective and a non - collective state is negligible .      in this section",
    "we introduce the approximations made by dnau and frauendorf , and use these as the practical basis for our investigation .",
    "first we assume that we have a finite sum of separable interactions , where each of the terms in ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : g ] ) is of the form @xmath44 here @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the strengths of the corresponding multipole and pairing forces , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the appropriate single particle matrix elements . for the moment we consider only monopole - pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole interaction ( the inclusion of hexadecapole and the quadrupole - pairing interactions is left for later work ) .",
    "the quadrupole - quadrupole and monopole - pairing operators are @xmath49    co - workers have adopted next we identify the `` collective '' subspace appropriate for the applications that follow .",
    "the obvious choice is the ground state rotational band @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the projection of angular momentum on the body fixed axis .",
    "the fact that this `` collective '' subspace approximately decouples from the remaining states is equivalent to the requirement that inter - band @xmath52 transitions are much smaller than the intra - band transitions .",
    "this is generally true for deformed nuclei . a last approximation for deformed nuclei , convenient but not necessary ,",
    "is to replace the excitation energies as well as the multipole and pairing fields by their average values for the two neighboring even - even nuclei .    before we go on to the next step it is convenient to rewrite the eom with reduced matrix elements , using the wigner - eckart theorem .",
    "we can thus derive equations of motion , again dropping all indices , @xmath53 where @xmath30 and @xmath29 are the reduced cfp @xmath54 the self - consistent fields are represented by the expressions @xmath55 and the generalized pairing force is approximated by a constant gap energy for all levels , @xmath56 the normalization condition becomes @xmath57          = 1 .",
    "\\label{eq : ortho}\\ ] ] here the inclusion of only the collective subspace is somewhat more questionable than for the eom , but there appears to be no simple alternative .",
    "the final step in the derivation is the replacement of the self consistent fields by phenomenological inputs . in this context",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath39 are the quadrupole matrix elements of the neighboring even nuclei and @xmath39 their gap energies .",
    "the quadrupole fields can either be extracted from experiment or calculated using a phenomenological model such as the bohr - mottelson model @xcite , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a phenomenological input which can be obtained from experimental values .",
    "having described the assumptions involved in the derivation of the model , we turn to the task of solving the resulting equations .",
    "the main difficulty in solving those equations is that the set of solutions ( [ eq : deom1 ] ) is over - complete by a factor of two .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the basis states @xmath61 and @xmath62 form an over - complete and non - orthogonal set as in the standard bcs model .",
    "half of the states found by solving ( [ eq : deom1 ] ) are spurious , and these have to be identified . to remove the spurious solutions one can proceed in the following way @xcite :",

    "therefore , @xmath69 has eigenvalues @xmath70 or 0 .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian which are also eigenstates of @xmath69 with eigenvalue @xmath70 describe the real quasiparticle excitations in the odd-@xmath2 nucleus , whereas the eigenstates with eigenvalue 0 characterize the spurious states .",
    "we next decompose the hamiltonian as ,    @xmath71    where @xmath72 @xmath73 is interpreted as a generalized quasi - particle hamiltonian and @xmath74 as the core hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath66 is separated into two parts because @xmath73 is antisymmetric with respect to particle - hole conjugation ( @xmath75 ) , and therefore , as in the usual bcs theory @xcite , the solutions of this part of the hamiltonian are divided into two sets with sign - reversed energies ; the negative energy solutions are the spurious states .",
    "this decomposition gives a good starting point for a numerical technique to remove the spurious states .",
    "first , we turn off the core hamiltonian @xmath74 .",
    "we solve the eigenvalue problem , @xmath76 , and find the solutions @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 from the physical states @xmath80 we can construct the density matrix @xmath81 as in ( [ eq : dm ] ) .",
    "then the core hamiltonian is gradually turned on , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a scaling parameter .",
    "the next step is to diagonalize @xmath84 and find the new solutions , @xmath85 .",
    "if the change of @xmath83 is not too big , the quantity @xmath86 will either be close to 0 or to @xmath70 . when the value of @xmath86 is close to @xmath70 it is a real state and when it is close to zero it is a spurious state .",
    "now we can construct the new density matrix from the physical states @xmath87 which we call @xmath88",
    ". then @xmath83 is incrementally increased and this process is repeated until @xmath89 . in practice",
    "this method works very well since the change in the eigenvalues of @xmath69 never exceeds @xmath90 , even with only 15 incremental steps .",

    ", @xmath73 is equivalent to the usual nilsson plus pairing hamiltonian . to demonstrate this , we first diagonalize the particle - hole part ( @xmath93 ) of @xmath73 .",

    ", @xmath38 defines a different fixed quadrupole field or , in other words , an instantaneous orientation of the core .",
    "the index @xmath95 can be related to @xmath51 , the projection of the angular momentum on the body fixed frame , by a method described below .",
    "finally , the solutions of the @xmath73 , including pairing , are @xmath96    the remaining problem is to find the correspondence between the values of @xmath51 and those of @xmath95 .",
    "this is not straightforward because h@xmath97 is an angular momentum conserving quantity ; therefore @xmath51 can not be obviously associated with the eigenvalues .",
    "we use the fact that among states with different @xmath21 , states with the same value of @xmath51 have identical eigenvalues .",
    "we can extract a unique state of maximal @xmath51 value in the following way : compare the @xmath98 doubly degenerate solutions for angular momentum @xmath21 with the @xmath99 doubly degenerate solutions for @xmath100 . since the maximum values of @xmath51 are @xmath21 and @xmath100 , respectively , the additional pair of solutions for angular momentum @xmath21 must have @xmath101 .",

    "we include all single particle and hole l evels from from the @xmath182 major shell as well as intruder states from n=5 and n=7 shells .",
    "as was to be expected , the strength of the interaction must be adjusted because of the change in the size of the single particle space .",

    "we turn now to previous theoretical work on @xmath0gd , in order to summarize it and compare it with our own work and with experiment . we can divide this work into three major groups according to the formulation applied .    in the papers of the first group , refs . @xcite",

    "the underlying physics is that of the standard core - particle coupling ( cpc ) model .",
    "allowance is made for phonon excitations of the core , which can have both a quadrupole and hexadecapole deformation .",
    "the single particle states are found using a woods - saxon potential , and one uses a bcs approximation to include pairing correlations .",
    "in addition , interactions between states with principle quantum number differing by two are also included .",
    "only band - heads have been calculated with this model , and the results show little improvement , as regards experiment , over calculations based on the nilsson model , although fewer parameters are used in this approach @xcite . in all these calculations the coriolis interaction is neglected .",
    "the argument is that the coriolis interaction has only a slight effect on the energies and structures of the lowest parts of the rotational bands @xcite .",
    "the results of the best two calculations of this type are compared with experiment and with our calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the second group , refs.@xcite contains complete calculations of the rotational spectrum in the standard core - particle coupling model .",
    "early works based on this model utilize a rotating deformed core which is coupled to a single odd nucleon . the mean field from the core is represented by a nilsson potential .",
    "the coupling between the core and the odd nucleon , the coriolis coupling , is treated as a perturbation ( strong coupling limit ) . in ref",
    "@xcite a deformed woods - saxon potential is considered .",
    "again , pairing is taken into account by means of a bcs transformation .",
    "another extension of the original model takes into account mixing between different major shells @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we show the experimental values compared to three theoretical models .",

    "the model hamiltonian includes a quadrupole and hexadecapole deformed core .",
    "the pairing is treated in bcs approximation .",
    "the deformation parameters @xmath206 , @xmath207 and the moment of inertia @xmath208 are taken as freely adjustable parameters .",
    "the set of results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c is from ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "the same woods - saxon potential and bcs approximation are used .",
    "the model contains two additional free parameters : the moment of inertia and the coriolis attenuation factor @xmath141 , which was found to be 0.63 .",
    "the last part of fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] is based on our results , without any coriolis attenuation .",
    "the third group includes models based on dynamical symmetry arguments ; the pseudo su(3 ) @xcite and the interacting boson - fermion approximation ( ibfa ) @xcite .",
    "the results are reasonable for both models but they will not be reviewed because they describe only the lowest bands .",
    "in this paper we have applied to @xmath0gd the core - particle model as originally formulated by klein and co - workers and modified for practical application by dnau and frauendorf . when levels from several major shells were included , the band - heads were predicted quite satisfactorily .",
    "the rotational structure is predicted with high accuracy and only the higher bands are distorted .",
    "we believe that the reason for this distortion is the coriolis interaction which is included naturally in the core hamiltonian ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the standard approach to this difficulty is to attenuate the coriolis interaction @xcite .",
    "since there is no justification for this ad - hoc procedure , the best approach is to include other forms of interaction which will counteract this effect .",
    "the suggested candidates are the quadrupole - pairing and hexadecapole - hexadecapole interactions , which will be investigated in the further development of this work .",
    "the electric transitions @xmath52 were predicted and the results are closer to the experimental values than any other theory for which comparisons have been made . for the magnetic transitions @xmath203 we reproduce the experiment but need 4 parameters to do so .",
    "these parameters are not fully constrained by experiment .",
    "finally , it may be useful to summarize in general what has been accomplished and how the model may be extended . in our approach , the kinematical coriolis coupling between the particle and the core is automatically included .",
    "there is in fact no natural way of introducing an ad - hoc attenuation , for which we have found little evidence .",
    "there is some indication in higher excited bands , but not enough data is available to substantiate this . in our calculations",
    "an excessive influence of this coupling can be dealt with only by modifying the effective interaction .",
    "in addition non - adiabatic corrections to the treatment of the core may be studied , either by use of experimental matrix elements or by calculating higher order corrections to the bohr - mottelson theory . finally to study experimental results at higher angular momentum",
    ", we must include excited bands of the core .",
