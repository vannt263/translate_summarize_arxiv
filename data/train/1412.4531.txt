    "this network region can be considered to be weak in a sense that it is only a collection of a small number of photospheric magnetic bright points .",
    "however , in other more extended network regions with larger numbers of bright points , the slit jaw images show a pattern of a diffuse halo around the network patch , frequently interspersed with dynamic bright streaks that often appear to move away from the network region .",
    "these streaks are recently described as network jets by @xcite .",
    "many of these network jets can be directly related to rbes and rres in the crisp doppler movies : they can often be associated with an rbe or rre in close vicinity with similar orientation and temporal evolution ( life time and direction of propagation ) .",

    "we use coordinated observations from the sst and iris to identify the disk counterparts of type ii spicules in various iris chromospheric and tr diagnostics .",
    "one of the data sets is a more than 2  h time series with the iris spectrograph slit positioned in the proximity ( @xmath25 ) of a small network region in a coronal hole . a large number of h@xmath0  rbes and rres ( @xmath26150 )",
    "were found to be covered by the iris slit . for these events , we find clear correspondence between the temporal behaviour of the h@xmath0  line and the  h & k lines : for h@xmath0  rbes we find corresponding mg blue - shifted spectral features and for rres we find corresponding red - shifted features .",
    "we observe that the k3 and h3 central absorption dips show similar doppler excursions as the asymmetries in the h@xmath0  line .",
    "this often leads to a strong reduction ( sometimes almost complete removal ) of one of the k2 and h2 reversal peaks accompanied with a doppler shift of this peak .",
    "the shift results in enhanced emission in the wing so that rbe / rres can be observed as bright features in the  h & k wings .",
    "this is different from h@xmath0  and  8542    where rbe / rres are pure absorption features and therefore appear dark in wing images .    with 4  s exposure times , the and spectra in this coronal hole region are to a large extent dominated by noise .",
    "however , after averaging of spectra ( both spatially and temporally ) , we are able to identify spectral signatures for these lines that can be associated with h@xmath0  and mg rbes and rres .",
    "we often see ( weak ) enhanced emission with corresponding doppler shift for both the and lines . in a different data set , with",
    "the iris slit positioned in the proximity of a more extended magnetic network region in a quiet sun region , we observe for some h@xmath0  rbes and rres much stronger response in these upper - chromospheric and tr diagnostics .",
    "for these events , no spectral averaging is needed and the presence of and signal corresponding to h@xmath0  rbes or rres is unquestionable . the rbes and rres that have strong and response can be clearly identified as bright streaks in the sji 1330 and 1400 slit - jaw images .",
    "these kind of bright streaks can be found around the stronger network regions anywhere on the solar disk in the iris sji 1330 and 1400 data , @xcite describe these features as network jets .",
    "when we have coordinated sst h@xmath0  observations , we can often identify corresponding rbes and rres that display striking similarity in morphology and dynamical evolution .",
    "this suggests that we observe the same feature in different diagnostics .",
    "here we present 4 examples of h@xmath0  rbe / rres that can be associated with sji 1330 or 1400 jets .",
    "@xcite present 3 other events from the same data sets for which sji 1330 and 1400 jets are associated with rbe / rres that display clear twist in their dynamical evolution .",
    "the relatively broad bandpasses for the sji 1330 and 1400 filters ( 55    for both ) cover a large continuum window .",
    "the strong line emission we observe for jets that are covered by the iris slit indicates that the network jets in the slit jaw data are dominated by line emission rather than continuum contribution .",
    "we conclude that our observations show that type ii spicules are heated to at least tr temperatures , interpreting the emission as signs of @xmath27  kk plasma ( under equilibrium conditions ) .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who tied hinode  h type ii spicules at the quiet sun limb to iris sji 1400 spicules .",
    "their study demonstrates that the hinode ca  h passband shows type ii spicules only during their initial ( cooler ) phase and that the spicules continue to evolve in the hotter sji 1400 passband .",
    "furthermore , @xcite identified rbe and rre signatures in  k spectroheliograms from dense iris rasters close to the limb .",
    "many of these mg rbes and rres could be seen to continue in spectroheliograms .",
    "our study supports these results and further establish a close connection between rbe / rres observed in h@xmath0  and  h & k.    we note the difference between the small network region close to the iris slit in the 22-sep-2013 coronal hole data set and the more extended network regions in the same and other data sets . for the small network region",
    "we only find weak and signal and an absence of network jets in sji 1330 and 1400 .",
    "for the more extended network regions we find network jets and associated features in the spectrograms . in the crisp h@xmath0  and  8542 data however , we can not identify a clear difference in rbe / rre activity between these network regions .",
    "apparently , while these network regions seem indistinguishable in chromospheric diagnostics , for the smaller network region insufficient opacity is built up in and . whether this is due to a different level of heating or mass loading",
    "can only be speculated on .",
    "the network jets appear often to be embedded in diffuse halos that surround the larger network regions in sji 1330 and 1400 data , while these halos appear to be absent in small network regions like in the 22-sep-2013 data set .",
    "apparently , the weak and emission that we effectively find for almost all rbes and rres is insufficient to give discernible signal in the slit jaw data around small network regions .",
    "it might however be well possible that the diffuse halo around the larger network regions result from type ii spicules with insufficient opacity to stand out as individual network jets in the slit jaw images .",
    "we find a number of clear examples of sji 1330 and 1400 network jets that are connected to h@xmath0  rbes and/or rres .",
    "however , we can not firmly establish a chromospheric rbe / rre connection for all network jets in our data .",
    "it is possible that this is due to a line - of - sight effect : some network jets might follow a dynamic trajectory that is unfavourable for identification in h@xmath0  wing dopplergrams .",
    "furthermore , it can not be excluded that some network jets simply do not have a chromospheric component or are observed during a more energetic part of their evolution that makes it difficult to connect to a possible earlier chromospheric phase .",
    "@xcite connect network jets to the solar wind and measure apparent velocities that are often well above 100  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "these apparent velocities are on the high end of what has been found earlier for rbe / rres and type ii spicules .",
    "the doppler shifts we measure for and are in the low range of what was found for rbe / rres @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that single gaussian fits do not catch the full complexity of these profiles . for example",
    ", there appears to be an extra component at @xmath28  km  s@xmath9  in the far blue wing of the profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : jets]c .",
    "further effort is required to explore how the asymmetry in the profiles can be characterised .",
    "this is crucial in order to determine to what extent the high apparent speeds in network jets are real mass flows .    in this letter",
    ", we do not address the temporal evolution of the spicules in our coordinated data set .",
    "we note , however , the prominent appearance of swings between red and blue shifts in the @xmath12-diagrams .",
    "it seems that this temporal variation is much more clearly tractable than in the ground - based h@xmath0  and  8542  data .",
    "potentially , this opens a new diagnostic window on the alfvnic wave modes that govern the dynamics of spicules .",
    "however , disentangling the observed doppler shifts in uniquely determined kink , torsional and up - flow components will remain to be a formidable challenge .",
