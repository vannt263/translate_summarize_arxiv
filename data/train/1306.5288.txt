    "understanding the structure and function of complex systems is of wide interest across many fields of science and technology , from sociology to physics and biology .",
    "networks with similar topological features such as degree distribution or graph diameter can exhibit significantly different local structure . thus , there is much interest in exploring small connected subgraph patterns in networks , which are often shaped during their growth and have been used to characterize communication and evolution patterns in osns  @xcite .",
    "for example , simple 3-node subgraph classes such as  the enemy of my enemy is my friend \" and  the friend of my friend is my friend \" are well known evolution patterns in social networks .",
    "kunegis et al .",
    "@xcite considered the significance of these subgraph patterns in slashdot zoo evaluating the stability of signed friend / foe subgraphs .",
    "other examples include counting relative frequencies of closed triangle ( i.e. , three users connected with each other ) , which are probably more prevalent in facebook than twitter , since twitter serves more as a news media than an osn service  @xcite .",
    "more complex examples of @xmath0-node subgraph frequencies , @xmath1 , include milo et al .  @xcite defined network motifs ( or local subgraph patterns ) as small subgraph classes occurring in networks at numbers that are significantly larger than found in random networks .",
    "network motifs have been used for pattern recognition in gene expression profiling  @xcite , protein - protein interaction predication  @xcite , and coarse - grained topology generation  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , characterizing the frequencies of subgraph patterns by searching and counting subgraphs is computationally intensive since the number of possible @xmath0-node combinations in the original graph increases exponentially with @xmath0 . to address this problem , kashtan et al .",
    "@xcite propose to sample subgraphs using random edge sampling but this method scales poorly with the subgraph size and the results can be heavily biased .",
    "wernicke  @xcite proposes another approach ( fanmod ) based on enumerating subgraph trees .",
    "the latter relies on random node sampling , which is either not supported by most osn apis or is too resource intensive to be practical ( with respect to cache misses and vacant user i d space  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is paramount for such algorithms to query the graph on - the - fly without knowledge of the complete topology .",
    "moreover , such algorithms should output accurate high accuracy estimates of subgraph concentrations with as few queries as possible . recently ,",
    "bhuiyan et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a metropolis - hastings - based algorithm ( henceforth denoted guise ) that jointly estimates concentrations of 3-node , 4-node , and 5-node connected induced subgraphs ( cises ) .",
    "however , the rejection sampling procedure of the metropolis - hastings random walk ( mhrw ) used in guise has received much criticism lately in the precise context of graph sampling  @xcite . rejecting a sample",
    "incurs the _ cost of sampling _ without gathering information in exchange . and , information - wise , the rejected samples may contain more information about the statistic of interest than the accepted samples .",
    "recently , ribeiro and towsley  @xcite shows that mhrw rejects information - rich samples when trying to estimate the degree distribution of a graph .",
    "the end result is a sampling method that exhibits large estimation errors .",
    "a new estimation method that does not suffer from the above mentioned problems is needed .    in this work",
    "we propose two algorithms to accurately estimate subgraph concentrations .",
    "the first one , denoted psrw , significantly improves upon guise in two fronts : ( a ) psrw can estimate statistics of cises of any size , in contrast to guise that is limited to jointly estimating 3-node , 4-node , and 5-node cises ; and ( b ) through careful design psrw does not reject samples , making the estimation errors of psrw significantly lower than those of guise .",
    "most importantly , psrw is not an incremental improvement over guise but rather a different type of random walk that is designed without the need to reject samples , using the horvitz - thompson estimator  @xcite to unbias the observations .",
    "the second algorithm we propose , denoted mix subgraph sampling or mss , can jointly estimate cises of sizes @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath3 for any @xmath4 , not only generalizing guise ( guise 3-node , 4-node , and 5-node cises is the special case @xmath5 ) but also achieving lower estimation errors",
    ". one of the main differences between guise and psrw or mss is that our random walk is designed to sample nodes that are important for the cis estimation and use _ all of the gathered samples _ in the estimation phase .",
    "_ through simulations we show that both of our methods ( psrw and mss ) are significantly more accurate than guise for either the same number queried nodes or the same walk clock time ( using a modern computer ) . the walk clock time is measured under the assumptions of access to a local database or a remote database ( assuming 100 milliseconds of query response delay )",
    "_ our methods represent the network as a _",
    "cis relationship graph _ , whose nodes are _ connected and induced subgraphs _ ( cises ) of the original network .",
    "[ fig : examplecisgraph ] illustrates a cis relationship graph for subgraphs of two , three , and four node subgraphs .",
    "our algorithms consist of running a random walk ( rw ) on the cis relationship graph .",
    "besides its accuracy , our algorithms are lightweight .",
    "they require little memory ( more precisely , @xmath6 space where @xmath0 is the subgraph size and @xmath7 is the number of queried nodes ) and , more importantly , _",
    "significantly fewer queries than the state - of - the - art methods to achieve the same accuracy_. note that building the completely cis relationship graph is prohibitively expensive , both in terms of queries and memory .",
    "thus , our rw methods _ do not require _ the cis relationship graph and there is no need to know the complete graph topology in advance , only the parts of the network already queried .",
    "we also prove that a rw on the cis relationship graph achieves asymptotically unbiased concentration estimates of the distinct subgraphs on the original network .",

    "<S> exploring statistics of locally connected subgraph patterns ( also known as network motifs ) has helped researchers better understand the structure and function of biological and online social networks ( osns ) . nowadays the massive size of some critical networks  often stored in already overloaded relational databases  effectively limits the rate at which nodes and edges can be explored , making it a challenge to accurately discover subgraph statistics . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose _ sampling methods _ to accurately estimate subgraph statistics from as few queried nodes as possible . </S>",
    "<S> we present sampling algorithms that efficiently and accurately estimate subgraph properties of massive networks . </S>",
