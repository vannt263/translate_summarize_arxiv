    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) form from the gravitational collapse when an initially dense region on super - horizon scales enters the horizon during the early radiation - dominated era ( carr & hawking 1974 , carr 1975 ) . in the inflationary universe ,",
    "the abundance of pbhs is extremely sensitive to the spectral index @xmath0 , which specifies the dependence of the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations on the comoving wavenumber @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "thus , a constraint on the abundance of pbhs will also yield a constraint on the index @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest constraint on the abundance of pbhs is given by the condition @xmath6 , i.e. , the mass density of the pbhs should be less than the critical density of the universe .",
    "this condition results in @xmath7 regardless of whether a black hole can evaporate completely , or ends with a planck relic ( kim & lee 1996 ) .",
    "more effective constraints can be derived by comparing the particle emission from pbh evaporation with observed background .",
    "for instance , the cosmic background of @xmath8-ray spectrum on @xmath9 mev places a tightest constraint on the pbh density parameter @xmath10 ( macgibbon & carr 1991 ) , which yields the index @xmath11 ( kim , lee & macgibbon 1999 ) .",
    "however , these constraints depend on an additional parameter , the reheating temperature @xmath12 , or equivalently , the minimum mass of pbhs @xmath13 , which is not well determined .",
    "recently , the epoch of the onset of the cosmic reionization is explored with absorption spectrum of high redshift ( @xmath14 ) sdss quasars ( fan et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "the existence of the complete ly@xmath15 gunn - peterson trough in the absorption spectra of high redshift quasars indicates that the dark age probably ended at the redshift @xmath16 .",
    "the ionizing photon background in the igm at @xmath2 is found to be more than 20 times lower than that at @xmath17 .",
    "these results motivate us to explore the constraints on the abundance of pbhs , and then on the primordial density perturbations with the low energy photon background at the epoch of reionization .",
    "we will show that this constraint is basically independent of the uncertain parameters @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "pbhs have been considered as a possible source of the cosmic reionization ( gibilisco 1996 , 1997 ) , but in these works , the mass function of pbhs is treated as free parameters .",
    "it can not be used to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in  2 , we briefly present the methods of calculating the mass function of the pbhs and the ionizing photon background from pbh s evaporation .",
    "the numerical results of the constraints on @xmath0 from the observed high redshift ionizing background are given in  3 .",
    " 4 are discussions and conclusions .",
    "for gaussian primeval density perturbations , the mass function @xmath18 of pbhs at redshift @xmath19 can be calculated by the same way as calculating the mass function of collapsed massive halos with the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "accordingly , the number density of regions with density contrast from @xmath20 to @xmath21 and mass @xmath22 to @xmath23 at the time @xmath24 of the onset of radiation - dominated epoch is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cosmic mean mass density at @xmath24 , @xmath22 the mass within @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the variance of the probability distribution function of initial gaussian mass field smoothed by scale @xmath27 . since the mass function is normalized at @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath29 , eq.(1 ) gives the physical number density of region @xmath30 at @xmath24 .",
    "the comoving number density is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the cosmic factor .",
    "it has been shown ( carr 1975 ) that when a region @xmath33 enters the horizon at @xmath34 , i.e. when @xmath22 is about the same as horizon mass at @xmath34 , this region will collapse to a black hole if the initial density contrast @xmath20 satisfies @xmath35 where parameter @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the horizon mass at @xmath24 , i.e. the horizon mass at the beginning of the radiation - dominated .",
    "the mass of a black hole formed from this region is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the mass function of pbhs is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the density contrast when the region @xmath30 crosses the horizon at @xmath34 , and variance @xmath41 . since @xmath42 ,",
    "the minimum mass of the pbh is @xmath43 .    for a power law initial density perturbation with spectral index @xmath0 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 , and eq.(3 ) becomes ( kim & lee 1996 ) @xmath46 as usual , the variance @xmath47 will be normalized with the cobe observation ( e.g. , fang & xu 1999 , bugaev & konishchev 2001 ) .    in eq.(4 ) , only the factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 are dependent on @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 . on the other hand , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the time and the redshift at the end of the radiation - dominated era .",
    "thus , the comoving mass function @xmath54 is independent of @xmath24 .      for a schwarzschild black hole @xmath55 ,",
    "the hawking emission rate for particles with spin @xmath56 , energy from @xmath57 to @xmath58 and per degree of particle freedom is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the temperature of black hole @xmath55 , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath61 is the absorption probability of spin @xmath56 particle by a black hole @xmath55 ( macgibbon & webber 1990 ; page 1975 ) . for low energy photon emission , i.e.",
    ", @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and eq.(5 ) gives @xmath64}.\\ ] ]    the evaporation leads to the decreasing of black hole mass with the rate @xmath65 where @xmath66 takes into account all degrees of freedom of evaporated particles ( macgibbon 1991 ) .",
    "since @xmath66 is not a strong function of @xmath55 , the time dependence of @xmath55 for a black hole with initial mass @xmath67 at @xmath34 is approximated by @xmath68^{1/3},\\ ] ] if @xmath69 .",

    "the integral upper limit @xmath76 in eq.(9 ) in not important , as the mass function @xmath18 is rapidly decreasing with the increasing of @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath77 is the opacity for photons emitted at @xmath19 and observed at @xmath71 at the frequency @xmath78 .",
    "using eq.(9 ) , we calculate the ionizing photon background at redshift @xmath79 - 8 . the opacity @xmath80 for photons observed at the hydrogen lyman edge ( @xmath81 = 13.6 ev ) is dominated by hi photoelectric absorption .",
    "we will use the @xmath80 estimated by the so - called high absorption model ( meiksin & madau , 1993 ) .",

    "the mean transmission @xmath84 is less than @xmath85 at @xmath86 .",
    "that is , the effective flux @xmath87 observed at @xmath88 is only contributed by pbhs localized within the spatial range from @xmath88 to 6.5 . for @xmath89 ,",
    "this range is about @xmath89 to 8.25 .",
    "actually , eq.(10 ) is found from a fitting with observations at @xmath90 - 4 .",
    "however , there is no direct observation of the hydrogen lyman edge absorption at redshifts @xmath91 .",
    "nevertheless , eq.(10 ) is consistent with the ly@xmath15 transmission @xmath92 in the redshift range @xmath93 $ ] ( becker et al .",
    "hence , it would be reasonable to estimate the optical depth at @xmath88 - 6.5 by eq.(10 ) .",
    "the latest observation of the complete gunn - peterson troughs in the absorption spectrum of a @xmath19=6.28 quasar indicates that the photoionization rate at @xmath946 is lower than 8.0@xmath95s@xmath96 for ly@xmath15 , or 2.0@xmath95s@xmath96 for ly@xmath8 ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) . assuming the ionizing photons are from massive stars @xmath97 ( barkana & loeb 2001 )",
    ", one can then find that the upper limits to the ionizing photon background @xmath98 ( @xmath99 in unit of erg @xmath100 sec@xmath96hz@xmath96sr@xmath96 ) at photon energy 13.6ev are , respectively , @xmath101 and @xmath102 for ly@xmath15 , and ly@xmath8 , and at 24ev , are @xmath103 , @xmath104 for ly@xmath15 , and ly@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 presents the pbh contributed ionizing photon background @xmath105 at @xmath88 as a function of the index @xmath0 of the primordial fluctuation power spectrum .",
    "the upper limits to the ionizing photon background yield @xmath106 for @xmath57=13.6ev , and @xmath107 for @xmath57=24 ev .",
    "it should be pointed out that these constraint basically are independent of @xmath24 .",
    "eq.(9 ) shows that @xmath87 depends on @xmath24 only via @xmath13 , the truncation of pbh mass function at small mass side . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical depth at @xmath88 is very small .",
    "only pbhs , which can survive to @xmath108 , has contribution to @xmath87 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is independent of @xmath13 , if @xmath109 g , as those pbhs have already evaporated at @xmath108 [ eqs.(7 ) and ( 8) ] . in inflationary universe , @xmath110 ( kolb & turner 1990 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath13-independence leads to also @xmath12-independence .    the @xmath13 or @xmath12-independence of @xmath87 can be also seen from fig .",
    "2 , which plots @xmath111 vs. @xmath55 .",
    "it shows that @xmath87 at @xmath88 is mainly contributed by the evaporation of pbhs with mass @xmath112 g. therefore , @xmath87 is independent of @xmath13 if it is less than @xmath113 g. the peak @xmath113 g. is also consistent with the assumption of @xmath62 used in eq.(6 ) .",
    "we calculate the flux @xmath114 at @xmath88 in the frequency range from @xmath78 = 3@xmath115 to @xmath116 , which corresponds to photon energy range from 13.6 to 24.6 ev ( hei ionization ) . in this frequency interval one can still approximately use the optical depth @xmath80 of eq.(10 ) . the result is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the flux @xmath99 can be well approximated by a power law spectrum @xmath117 .",
    "this spectrum is very different from the models of massive stars ( @xmath118 ) and quasars ( @xmath119 , see madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ) , for both of which , the flux decreases with the increasing of @xmath78 .",
    "this is because @xmath99 are mainly from the low energy tail of the photon emission by 10@xmath120 g black holes , whose temperature @xmath121 . in the low energy tail",
    ", the intensity is increasing with @xmath78 .",
    "in all the above calculations , the photons produced from the fragmentation of the pbh - emitted quarks and gluons are not considered ( macgibbon 1991 ) . since",
    "@xmath87 is given by local pbhs , we need only to consider the fragmentation of quarks and gluons into low energy ( @xmath122 - 20 ev ) photons .",
    "this problem is still quite unclear and uncertain . since the fragmentation effect will lead to an increase of @xmath87",
    "therefore , all above - mentioned upper limits on @xmath0 will be held .",
    "in the standard inflationary model with a power - law power spectrum of the primeval density perturbations , we calculated the ionizing background flux of the pbhs . with",
    "the latest observed ionizing photon background flux at the redshift of reionization , we find that the spectral index of the primeval density perturbations should be @xmath123 , assuming that the background photon flux are emitted by massive stars . the difference is negligible if the background flux coming from quasars .",
    "if the parameter @xmath8 is taken to be 0.6 ( niemeyer & jedamzik 1998 ) , we have @xmath11.29 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath99 at @xmath89 .",
    "the result is almost the same as fig .",
    "however , there is no available data on the @xmath87 at this redshift",
    ". if the reionization is really onset at @xmath124 - 8 , @xmath87 at @xmath89 would be significantly less than that at @xmath125 , one may have more tight constraint .",
    "all these constraints are independent of the reheating temperature @xmath12 , if @xmath126 gev .",
    "the abundance of black hole given by this constraint is @xmath127 , which is much stronger than the critical density constraint @xmath128 .",
    "the current observations of the angular power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) are found to be able to fit with a @xmath129 power spectrum on angular scales from tens of degrees to sub - degrees .",
    "the pbh s constraint @xmath123 shows that primeval density perturbations might still be scale invariant on scales much less than the direct observation of the cmb .",
    "moreover , in the cmb data fitting , the parameters of the spectral index @xmath0 and the optical depth of the cmb photons to the last scattering surface @xmath130 are degenerated ( stompor et al . 2001 ) .",
    "that is , even when the fitted result is @xmath131 , the original index may be @xmath132 if @xmath133 . on the other hand ,",
