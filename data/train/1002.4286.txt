    "the relatively recent discipline of data mining involves a wide spectrum of techniques , inherited from different origins such as statistics , databases , or machine learning . among them",
    ", association rule mining is a prominent conceptual tool and , possibly , a cornerstone notion of the field , if there is one .",
    "currently , the amount of available knowledge regarding association rules has grown to the extent that the tasks of creating complete surveys and websites that maintain pointers to related literature become daunting .",
    "a survey , with plenty of references , is  @xcite , and additional materials are available in @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references and discussions in their introductory sections .",
    "given an agreed general set of `` items '' , association rules are defined with respect to a dataset that consists of `` transactions '' , each of which is , essentially , a set of items .",
    "association rules are customarily written as @xmath0 , for sets of items @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and they hold in the given dataset with a specific `` confidence '' quantifying how often @xmath2 appears among the transactions in which @xmath1 appears .",
    "a close relative of the notion of association rule , namely , that of exact implication in the standard propositional logic framework , or , equivalently , association rule that holds in 100% of the cases , has been studied in several guises .",
    "exact implications are equivalent to conjunctions of definite horn clauses : the fact , well - known in logic and knowledge representation , that horn theories are exactly those closed under bitwise intersection of propositional models leads to a strong connection with closure spaces , which are characterized by closure under intersection ( see  the discussions in @xcite  or  @xcite ) .",
    "implications are also very closely related to functional dependencies in databases .",
    "indeed , implications , as well as functional dependencies , enjoy analogous , clear , robust , hardly disputable notions of redundancy that can be defined equivalently both in semantic terms and through the same syntactic calculus .",
    "specifically , for the semantic notion of entailment , an implication @xmath0 is entailed from a set of implications @xmath3 if every dataset in which all the implications of @xmath3 hold must also satisfy @xmath0 ; and , syntactically , it is known that this happens if and only if @xmath0 is derivable from @xmath3 via the armstrong axiom schemes , namely , reflexivity ( @xmath0 for @xmath4 ) , augmentation ( if @xmath0 and @xmath5 then @xmath6 , where juxtaposition denotes union ) and transitivity ( if @xmath0 and @xmath7 then @xmath8 ) .    also , such studies have provided a number of ways to find implications ( or functional dependencies ) that hold in a given dataset , and to construct small subsets of a large set of implications , or of functional dependencies , from which the whole set can be derived ; in closure spaces and in data mining these small sets are usually called `` bases '' , whereas in dependency theory they are called `` covers '' , and they are closely related to deep topics such as hypergraph theory .",
    "associated natural notions of minimality ( when no implication can be removed ) , minimum size , and canonicity of a cover or basis do exist ; again it is inappropriate to try to give a complete set of references here , but see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "however , the fact has been long acknowledged ( e.g.  already in @xcite ) that , often , it is inappropriate to search only for absolute implications in the analysis of real world datasets .",
    "partial rules are defined in relation to their `` confidence '' : for a given rule @xmath0 , the ratio of how often @xmath1 and @xmath2 are seen  together to how often @xmath1 is seen .",
    "many other alternative measures of intensity of implication exist @xcite , @xcite ; we keep our focus on confidence because , besides being among the most common ones , it has a natural interpretation for educated users through its correspondence with the observed conditional probability .",
    "the idea of restricting the exploration for association rules to frequent itemsets , with respect to a support threshold , gave rise to the most widely discussed and applied algorithm , called apriori @xcite , and to an intense research activity .",
    "already with full - confidence implications , the output of an association mining process often consists of large sets of rules , and a well - known difficulty in applied association rule mining lies in that , on large datasets , and for sensible settings of the confidence and support thresholds and other parameters , huge amounts of association rules are often obtained . therefore , besides the interesting progress in the topic of how to organize and  query the rules discovered ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , one research topic that has been worthy of attention is the identification of patterns that indicate redundancy of rules , and ways to avoid that redundancy ; and each proposed notion of redundancy opens up a major research problem , namely , to provide a general method for constructing bases of minimum size with respect to that notion of redundancy .    for partial rules ,",
    "the armstrong schemes are not valid anymore .",
    "reflexivity does hold , but transitivity takes a different form that affects the confidence of the rules : if the rule @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 , which is equivalent ) and the rule @xmath11 both hold with confidence at least @xmath12 , we still know nothing about the confidence of @xmath13 ; even the fact that both @xmath10 and @xmath14 hold with confidence at least @xmath12 only gives us a confidence lower bound of @xmath15 for @xmath13 ( assuming  ) .",
    "augmentation does not hold at all ; indeed , enlarging the antecedent of a rule of confidence at least @xmath12 may give a rule with much smaller confidence , even zero : think of a case where most of the times @xmath1 appears it comes with  @xmath16 , but it only comes with @xmath2 when @xmath16 is not present ; then the confidence of @xmath8 may be high whereas the confidence of @xmath17 may be null . similarly",
    ", if the confidence of @xmath18 is high , it means that @xmath2 and @xmath16 appear together in most of the transactions having @xmath1 , whence the confidences of @xmath0 and @xmath8 are also high ; but , with respect to the converse , the fact that both @xmath2 and @xmath16 appear in fractions at least @xmath12 of the transactions having @xmath1 does not inform us that they show up _ together _ at a similar ratio of these transactions : only a ratio of @xmath19 is guaranteed as a lower bound .",
    "in fact , if we look only for association rules with singletons as consequents ( as in some of the analyses in @xcite , or in the `` basic association rules '' of @xcite , or even in the traditional approach to association rules @xcite and the useful apriori implementation of borgelt available on the web  @xcite ) we are almost certain to lose information . as a consequence of these failures of the armstrong schemes , the canonical and minimum - size cover construction methods available for implications or functional dependencies are not appropriate for partial association rules .    on the semantic side ,",
    "a number of formalizations of the intuition of redundancy among association rules exist in the literature , often with proposals for defining irredundant bases ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,  @xcite , the  survey  @xcite , and section  6 of the survey  @xcite ) .",
    "all of these are weaker than the notion that we would consider natural by comparison with implications ( of which we start the study in the last section of this paper ) .",
    "we observe here that one may wish to fulfill two different roles with a basis , and that both appear ( somewhat mixed ) in the literature : as a computer - supported data structure from which confidences and supports of rules are computed ( a role for which we use the closures lattice instead ) or , in our choice , as a means of providing the user with a smallish set of association rules for examination and , if convenient , posterior enumeration of the rules that follow from each rule in the basis .",
    "that is , we will not assume to have available , nor to wish to compute , exact values for the confidence , but only discern whether it stays above a certain user - defined threshold .",
    "we compute actual confidences out of the closure lattice only at the time of writing out rules for the user .",
    "this paper focuses mainly on several such notions of redundancy , defined in a rather general way , by resorting to confidence and support inequalities : essentially , a rule is redundant with respect to another if it has at least the same confidence and support of the latter _ for every dataset_. we also discuss variants of this proposal and other existing definitions given in set - theoretic terms .",
    "for the most basic notion of redundancy , we provide formal proofs of the so far unstated equivalence among several published proposals , including a syntactic calculus and a formal proof of the fact , also previously unknown , that the existing basis known as the essential rules or the representative rules ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is of absolutely minimum size .",
    "it is natural to wish further progress in reducing the size of the basis .",
    "our theorems indicate that , in order to reduce further the size without losing information , more powerful notions or redundancy must be deployed .",
    "we consider for this role the proposal of handling separately , to a given extent , full - confidence implications from lower - than-1-confidence rules , in order to profit from their very different combinatorics . this separation is present in many constructions of bases for association rules @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we discuss corresponding notions of redundancy and completeness , and prove new properties of these notions ; we give a sound and complete deductive calculus for this redundancy ; and we refine the existing basis constructions up to a point where we can prove again that we attain the limit of the redundancy notion .",
    "next , we discuss yet another potential for strengthening the notion of redundancy .",
    "so far , all the notions have just related one partial rule to another , possibly in the presence of full implications .",
    "is it possible to combine two partial rules , of confidence at least @xmath12 , and still obtain a partial rule obeying that confidence level ? whereas the intuition is that these confidences will combine together to yield a confidence lower than @xmath12 , we prove that there is a specific case where a rule of confidence at least @xmath12 is nontrivially entailed by two of them .",
    "we fully characterize this case and obtain from the caracterization yet another deduction scheme .",
    "we hope that further progress along the notion of a _ set _ of partial rules entailing a partial rule will be made along the coming years .",
    "preliminary versions of the results in sections [ dedplain ] , [ redundcalculus ] , [ clocalcsoundcompl ] , and [ closbasedent ] have been presented  at discovery science 2008 @xcite ; preliminary versions of the remaining results ( except those in section  [ suppbound ] , which are newer and unpublished ) have been presented at ecmlpkdd  2008  @xcite .",
    "our notation and terminology are quite standard in the data mining literature .",
    "all our developments take place in the presence of a `` universe '' set @xmath20 of atomic elements called _ items _ ; their absence or presence in sets or items plays the same role as binary - valued attributes of a relational table .",
    "subsets of @xmath20 are called _",
    "itemsets_. a dataset @xmath21 is assumed to be given ; it consists of transactions , each of which is an itemset labeled by a unique transaction identifier .",
    "the identifiers allow us to distinguish among transactions even if they share the same itemset . upper - case , often subscripted letters from the end of the alphabet , like @xmath22  or  @xmath23 , denote itemsets .",
    "juxtaposition denotes union of itemsets , as in @xmath24 ; and @xmath25 denotes _ proper _ subsets , whereas @xmath26 is used for the usual subset relationship with potential equality .    for a transaction @xmath27 , we denote @xmath28 the fact that @xmath1 is a subset of the itemset corresponding to @xmath27 , that is , the transaction satisfies the minterm corresponding to @xmath1 in the propositional logic sense .    from the given dataset",
    "we obtain a notion of support of an itemset : @xmath29 is the cardinality of the set of transactions that include it , @xmath30 ; sometimes , abusing language slightly , we also refer to that set of transactions itself as support .",
    "whenever @xmath21 is clear , we drop the subindex : @xmath31 .",
    "observe that @xmath32 whenever @xmath33 ; this is immediate from the definition .",
    "note that many references resort to a normalized notion of support by dividing by the dataset size .",
    "we chose not to , but there is no essential issue here .",
    "often , research work in data mining assumes that a threshold on the support has been provided and that only sets whose support is above the threshold ( then called `` frequent '' ) are to be considered .",
    "we will require this additional constraint occassionally for the sake of discussing the applicability of our developments .",
    "we immediately obtain by standard means ( see , for instance , @xcite or @xcite )  a notion of closed itemsets , namely , those that can not be enlarged while maintaining the same support .",
    "the function that maps each itemset to the smallest closed set that contains it is known to be monotonic , extensive , and idempotent , that is , it is a closure operator .",
    "this notion will be reviewed in more detail later  on .",
    "closed sets whose support is above the support threshold , if given , are usually termed closed frequent sets .",
    "association rules are pairs of itemsets , denoted as @xmath0 for itemsets @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "intuitively , they suggest the fact that @xmath2 occurs particularly often among the transactions in which @xmath1 occurs . more precisely , each such rule has a confidence associated : the confidence @xmath34 of an association rule @xmath0 in a dataset @xmath21 is @xmath35 . as with support , often we drop the subindex @xmath21 . the support in @xmath21 of the association rule",
    "@xmath0 is @xmath36 .",
    "we can switch rather freely between right - hand sides that include the left - hand side and right - hand sides that do nt :    rules @xmath37 and @xmath38 are _ equivalent by reflexivity _ if @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    clearly , @xmath41 and , likewise , @xmath42 for any @xmath43 ; that is , the support and confidence of rules that are equivalent by reflexivity always coincide . a minor notational issue that we must point out is that , in some references , the left - hand side of a rule is required to be a subset of the right - hand side , as in @xcite or @xcite , whereas many others require the left- and right - hand sides of an association rule to be disjoint , such as @xcite or the original  @xcite .",
    "both the rules whose left - hand side is a subset of the right - hand side , and the rules that have disjoint sides , may act as canonical representatives for the rules equivalent to them by reflexivity .",
    "we state explicitly one version of this immediate fact for later reference :    [ disjointness ] if rules @xmath37 and @xmath38 are equivalent by reflexivity , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , then they are the same rule : @xmath39 and @xmath46 .    in general , we do allow , along our development , rules where the left - hand side , or a part of it , appears also at the right - hand side , because by doing so we will be able to simplify the mathematical arguments",
    ". we will assume here that , at the time of printing out the rules found , that is , for user - oriented output , the items in the left - hand side are removed from the right - hand side ; accordingly , we write our rules sometimes as @xmath47 to recall this convention .    also , many references require the right - hand side of an association rule to be nonempty , or even both sides .",
    "however , empty sets can be handled with no difficulty and do give meaningful , albeit uninteresting , rules .",
    "a partial rule @xmath48 with an empty right - hand side is equivalent by reflexivity to @xmath49 , or to @xmath50 for any @xmath43 , and all of these rules have always confidence  1 .",
    "a partial rule with empty left - hand side , as employed , for instance , in @xcite , actually gives the normalized support of the right - hand side as confidence value :    in a dataset @xmath21 of @xmath51 transactions , @xmath52 .",
    "[ emptysides ]    again , these sorts of rules could be omitted from user - oriented output , but considering them conceptually valid simplifies the mathematical development .",
    "we also resort to the convention that , if @xmath53 ( which implies that @xmath54 as well ) we redefine the undefined confidence @xmath55 as 1 , since the intuitive expression `` all transactions having  @xmath1 do have also @xmath2 '' becomes vacuously true .",
    "this convention is irrespective of whether @xmath56 .    throughout the paper , `` _ implications _ ''",
    "are association rules of confidence  1 , whereas `` _ partial rules _ '' are those having a confidence below  1 . when the confidence could be  1 or could be less , we say simply `` _ rule _ '' .",
    "we start our analysis from one of the notions of redundancy defined formally in  @xcite . the notion is employed also , generally with no formal definition , in several papers on association rules , which subsequently formalize and study just some particular cases of redundancy ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) ; thus , we have chosen to qualify this redundancy as `` standard '' .",
    "we propose also a small variation , seemingly less restrictive ; we have not found that variant explicitly defined in the literature , but it is quite natural .    1 .",
    "@xcite @xmath37 has _ standard redundancy _ with respect to @xmath38 if the confidence and support of @xmath37 are larger than or equal to those of @xmath38 , in _ all _ datasets .",
    "2 .   @xmath37 has _ plain redundancy _ with respect to @xmath38 if the confidence of @xmath37 is larger than or equal to the confidence of @xmath38 , in _ all _ datasets .",
    "[ plainreddefsa ]    generally , we will be interested in applying these definitions only to rules @xmath37 where @xmath57 since , otherwise , @xmath58 for all datasets and the rule is trivially redundant .",
    "we state and prove separately , for later use , the following new technical claim :    assume that rule @xmath37 is plainly redundant with respect to rule @xmath38 , and that @xmath57",
    ". then @xmath59 .",
    "[ suppfromconf ]    assume @xmath60 , to argue the contrapositive . then , we can consider a dataset consisting of one transaction @xmath61 and , say , @xmath62 transactions @xmath63 .",
    "no transaction includes @xmath64 , therefore @xmath65 ; however , @xmath66 is either 1 or @xmath67 , which can be pushed up as much as desired by simply increasing  @xmath62 .",
    "then , plain redundancy does not hold , because it requires @xmath68 to hold for all datasets whereas , for this particular dataset , the inequality fails .    the first use of this lemma is to show that plain redundancy is not , actually , weaker than standard redundancy .",
    "consider any two rules @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath37 has standard redundancy with respect to @xmath38 if and only if @xmath37 has plain redundancy with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "[ plainredboundssupport ]    standard redundancy clearly implies plain redundancy by definition .",
    "conversely , plain redundancy implies , first , @xmath68 by definition and , further , @xmath59 by lemma  [ suppfromconf ] ; this implies in turn @xmath69 , for all datasets , and standard redundancy holds .",
    "the reference @xcite also provides two more direct definitions of redundancy :    1 .   if @xmath70 and @xmath40 , rule @xmath37 is _ simply redundant _ with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath71 and @xmath72 , rule @xmath37 is _ strictly redundant _ with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "[ plainreddefsb ]    simple redundancy in @xcite is explained as a potential connection between rules that come from the same frequent set , in our case @xmath40 .",
    "the formal definition is not identical to our rendering : in its original statement in @xcite , rule @xmath73 is _ simply redundant _ with respect to @xmath18 , provided that @xmath74 .",
    "the reason is that , in that reference , rules are always assumed to have disjoint sides , and then both formalizations are clearly equivalent .",
    "we do not impose disjointness , so that the natural formalization of their intuitive explanation is as we have just stated in definition  [ plainreddefsb ] .",
    "the following is very easy to see ( and is formally proved in  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite both simple and strict redundancies imply standard redundancy .",
    "[ simpleandstrict ]    note that , in principle , there could possibly be many other ways of being redundant beyond simple and strict redundancies : we show below , however , that , in essence , this is not the case .",
    "we can relate these notions also to the _ cover operator _ of @xcite :    [ kryszcover ] @xcite rule @xmath38 covers rule @xmath37 when @xmath71 and @xmath59 .    here , again , the original definition , according to which rule @xmath0 covers rule @xmath75 if @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( plus some disjointness and nonemptiness conditions that we omit ) is appropriate for the case of disjoint sides .",
    "the formalization we give is stated also in @xcite as a property that characterizes covering .",
    "both simple and strict redundancies become thus merged into a single definition .",
    "we observe as well that the same notion is also employed , without an explicit name , in  @xcite .",
    "again , it should be clear that , in definition  [ kryszcover ] , the covered rule is indeed plainly redundant : whatever the dataset , changing from @xmath37 to @xmath38 the confidence stays equal or increases since , in the quotient @xmath35 that defines the confidence of a rule @xmath0 , the numerator can not decrease from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , whereas the denominator can not increase from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "also , the proposals in definition [ plainreddefsb ]  and  [ kryszcover ] are clearly equivalent :    rule @xmath38 covers rule @xmath37 if and only if rule @xmath37 is either simply redundant or strictly redundant with respect to @xmath38 , or they are equivalent by reflexivity .",
    "it turns out that all these notions are , in fact , fully equivalent to plain redundancy ; indeed , the following converse statement is a main new contribution of this section :    assume rule @xmath37 is plainly redundant with respect to @xmath38 , where @xmath57 .",
    "then rule @xmath38 covers rule @xmath37 .",
    "[ plainredcover ]    by lemma  [ suppfromconf ] , @xmath59 . to see the other inclusion , @xmath71 , assume to the contrary that @xmath82 .",
    "then we can consider a dataset in which one transaction consists of @xmath63 and , say , @xmath62 transactions consist of @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath82 , these @xmath62 transactions do not count towards the supports of @xmath22 or @xmath63 , so that the confidence of @xmath38 is  1 ; also , @xmath61 is not adding to the support of @xmath64 since @xmath57 .",
    "as @xmath59 , exactly one transaction includes @xmath64 , so that @xmath83 , which can be made as low as desired . this would contradict plain redundancy .",
    "hence , plain redundancy implies the two inclusions in the definition of cover .    combining the statements so far ,",
    "we obtain the following characterization :    consider any two rules @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath57 .",
    "the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath59 ( that is , rule @xmath38 covers rule @xmath37 ) ; 2 .",
    "rule @xmath37 is either simply redundant or strictly redundant with respect to rule @xmath38 , or they are equivalent by reflexivity ; 3 .",
    "rule @xmath37 is plainly redundant with respect to rule @xmath38 ; 4 .",
    "rule @xmath37 is standard redundant with respect to rule @xmath38 .",
    "[ plainredchar ]    marginally , we note here an additional strength of the proofs given .",
    "one could consider attempts at weakening the notion of plain redundancy by allowing for a `` margin '' or `` slack '' , appropriately bounded , but whose value is independent of the dataset , upon comparing confidences .",
    "the slack could be additive or multiplicative : conditions such as @xmath84 or @xmath85 , for all @xmath21 and for @xmath86 independent of @xmath21 , could be considered .",
    "however , such approaches do not define different redundancy notions : they result in formulations actually equivalent to plain redundancy .",
    "this is due to the fact that the proofs in lemma  [ suppfromconf ] and theorem  [ plainredcover ] show that the gap between the confidences of rules that do not exhibit redundancy can be made as large as desired within @xmath87 . likewise ,",
    "if we fix a confidence threshold @xmath88 beforehand and use it to define redundancy as @xmath89 for all @xmath21 , again an equivalent notion is obtained , independently of the concrete value of @xmath12 ; whereas , for @xmath90 , this is , instead , a characterization of armstrong derivability .      from the characterization just given",
    ", we extract now a sound and complete deductive calculus .",
    "it consists of three inference schemes : right - hand reduction ( @xmath91 ) , where the consequent is diminished ; right - hand augmentation ( @xmath92 ) , where the consequent is enlarged ; and left - hand augmentation ( @xmath93 ) , where the antecedent is enlarged . as customary in logic calculi",
    ", our rendering of each rule means that , if the facts above the line are already derived , we can immediately derive the fact below the line .",
    "@xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    we also allow always to state trivial rules :    @xmath97    clearly , scheme @xmath98 could be stated equivalently with @xmath99 below the line , by @xmath100 :    @xmath101    in fact , @xmath98 is exactly the simple redundancy from definition  [ plainreddefsb ] and , in the cases where @xmath4 , it provides a way of dealing with one direction of equivalence by reflexivity ; the other direction is a simple combination of the other two schemes .",
    "the reduction scheme @xmath102 allows us to `` lose '' information from the right - hand side ; it corresponds to strict redundancy .    as further alternative options ,",
    "it is easy to see that we could also join @xmath102 and @xmath100 into a single scheme :    @xmath103    but we consider that this option does not really simplify , rather obscures a bit , the proof of our corollary  [ calculus0complete ] below .",
    "also , we could allow as trivial rules @xmath0 whenever @xmath4 , which includes the case of @xmath104 ; such rules also follow from the calculus given by combining @xmath105 with @xmath100 and @xmath102 .",

    "[ calculus0complete ]    soundness , that is , all rules derived are plainly redundant , is simple to argue by checking that , in each of the inference schemes , the confidence of the rule below the line is greater than or equal to the confidence of the rule above the line : these facts are actually the known statements that each of equivalence by reflexivity , simple redundancy , and strict redundancy imply plain redundancy .",

    "the standard derivation symbol @xmath109 denotes derivability by application of the scheme indicated as a subscript .",
    "we note here that @xcite proposes a simpler calculus that consists , essentially , of @xmath98 ( called there `` weak left augmentation '' ) and @xmath102 ( called there `` decomposition '' ) .",
    "the point is that these two schemes are sufficient to prove completeness of the `` representative basis '' as given in that reference , due to the fact that , in that version , the rules of the representative basis include the left - hand side as part of the right - hand side ; but such a calculus is incomplete with respect to plain redundancy because it offers no rule to move items from left to right .",
    "a basis is a way of providing a shorter list of rules for a given dataset , with no loss of information , in the following sense :    given a set of rules @xmath3 , @xmath110 is a _ complete basis _ if every rule of @xmath3 is plainly redundant with respect to some rule of @xmath111 .",
    "bases are analogous to covers in functional dependencies , and we aim at constructing bases with properties that correspond to minimum size and canonical covers . the solutions for functional dependencies , however , are not valid for partial rules due to the failure of the armstrong schemes .    in all practical applications ,",

    "several studies , prominently @xcite , have put forward a different notion of redundancy ; namely , they give a separate role to the full - confidence implications , often through their associated closure operator . along this way , one gets a stronger notion of redundancy and , therefore , a possibility that smaller bases can be constructed .    indeed , implications can be summarized better , because they allow for transitivity and augmentation to apply in order to find redundancies ; moreover , they can be combined in certain forms of transitivity with partial rules : as a simple example , if @xmath139 and @xmath162 , that is , if a fraction @xmath12 or more of the support of @xmath1 has @xmath2 and _ all _ the transactions containing @xmath2 do have @xmath16 as well , clearly this implies that @xmath163 .",
    "observe , however , that the directionality is relevant : from @xmath164 and @xmath165 we infer nothing about @xmath166 , since the high confidence of @xmath7 might be due to a large number of transactions that do not include @xmath1 .",

    "is that closure operators are characterized by three properties : extensivity ( @xmath170 ) , idempotency ( @xmath173 ) , and monotonicity ( if @xmath33 then @xmath174 ) . as an example of the use of these properties , we note the following simple consequence for later use :    @xmath175 , and @xmath176 .",
    "[ trivial ]    we omit the immediate proof .",

    "note that some references use the term `` generator '' to mean our `` minimal generator '' ; we prefer to make explicit the minimality condition in the name . in some works ,",
    "often database - inspired , minimal generators are termed sometimes `` keys '' . in other works ,",
    "often matroid - inspired , they are termed also `` free sets '' . our definition says explicitly that @xmath168 .",
    "we will make liberal use of this fact , which is easy to check also with other existing alternative definitions of the closure operator , as stated in @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "several quite good algorithms exist to find the closed sets and their supports ( see section  4 of  @xcite ) .",
    "redundancy based on closures is a natural generalization of equivalence by reflexivity ; it works as follows ( @xcite , see also @xcite and section  4 in  @xcite ) :    given a dataset and the corresponding closure operator , two partial rules @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that @xmath178 and @xmath179 have the same support and the same confidence .",
    "[ closredcci ]    the rather immediate reason is that @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , groups of rules sharing the same closure of the antecedent , and the same closure of the union of antecedent and consequent , give cases of redundancy . on account of these properties , there are some proposals of basis constructions from closed sets in the literature , reviewed below .",
    "but the first fact that we must mention to relate the closure operator with our explanations so far is the following :    @xcite let @xmath47 be a representative rule as per definition  [ bcero ] . then @xmath2 is a closed set and @xmath1 is a minimal generator . [ bcerofromclosures ]    the proof is direct from definitions [ validants ]  and  [ bcero ] , and can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the authors of @xcite do the same , seemingly unaware that the algorithm in @xcite already works just with closed itemsets .",
    "fact  [ bcerofromclosures ] may shed doubts on whether closure - based redundancy actually can lead to smaller bases .",
    "we prove that this is sometimes the case , due to the fact that the redundancy notion itself changes , and allows for a form of transitivity , which we show can take again the form of a deductive calculus .",
    "then , we will be able to refine the notion of valid antecedent of the previous section and provide a basis for which we can prove that it has the smallest possible size among the bases for partial rules , with respect to closure - based completeness .",
    "that is , we will reach the limit of closure - based redundancy in the same manner as we did for standard redundancy in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath111 be the set of implications in the dataset @xmath21 ; alternatively , @xmath111 can be any of the bases already known for implications in a dataset . in our empirical validations below we have used as @xmath111 the guigues - duquenne basis , or gd - basis , that has been proved to be of minimum size @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an apparently popular and interesting alternative , that has been rediscovered over and over in different guises , is the so - called _ iteration - free basis _ of @xcite , which coincides with the proposal in @xcite and with the _ exact min - max basis _ of @xcite ( also called sometimes _ generic basis _",
    "@xcite ) ; because of fact  [ bcerofromclosures ] , it coincides exactly also with the representative rules of confidence  1 , that is : implications that are not plainly redundant with any other implication according to definition  [ plainreddefsa ] .",
    "also , it coincides with the `` closed - key basis '' for frequent sets in @xcite , which in principle is not intended as a basis for rules , and has a different syntactic sugar , but differs in essence from the iteration - free basis only in the fact that the support of each rule is explicitly recorded together with it .",
    "closure - based redundancy takes into account @xmath111 as follows :    let @xmath111 be a set of implications .",
    "partial rule @xmath182 has _ closure - based redundancy relative to @xmath111 _ with respect to rule @xmath183 , denoted @xmath184 , if any dataset @xmath21 in which all the rules in @xmath111 hold with confidence 1 gives @xmath185 .",
    "[ closredundancy ]    in some cases , it might happen that the dataset at hand does not satisfy any nontrivial rule with confidence 1 ; then , this notion will not be able to go beyond plain redundancy .",

    "more generally , all our results only depend on the implications reaching indeed full confidence in the dataset ; but they are not required to capture all of these : the implications in @xmath111 ( with their consequences according to the armstrong schemes ) could constitute just a part of the full - confidence rules in the dataset . in particular , plain redundancy reappears by choosing @xmath186 , whether the dataset satisfies or not any full - confidence implication .",
    "we continue our study by showing a necessary and sufficient condition for closure - based redundancy , along the same lines as the one in the previous section .",

    "we observe first that , in order to satisfy @xmath111 , it suffices to make sure that all the transactions in the dataset we are to construct are closed sets according to the closure operator corresponding to @xmath111 .",
    "assume now that @xmath194 : then a dataset consisting only of one or more transactions  with itemset @xmath195 satisfies ( vacuously ) @xmath38 with confidence 1 but , given that @xmath188 , leads to confidence zero for @xmath37 .",
    "it is also possible to argue without resorting to vacuous satisfaction : simply take one transaction consisting of @xmath196 and , in case this transaction satisfies @xmath37 , obtain as low a confidence as desired for @xmath37 by adding as many transactions @xmath195 as necessary ; these will not change the confidence of @xmath38 since @xmath194 .    then consider the case where @xmath189 , whence the other inclusion fails : @xmath197 .",
    "consider a dataset of , say , @xmath51 transactions , where one transaction consists of the itemset @xmath195 and @xmath198 transactions consist of the itemset @xmath196 .",
    "the confidence of @xmath38 is at least @xmath199 , which can be made as close to 1 as desired by increasing @xmath51 , whereas the presence of at least one @xmath61 and no transaction at all containing @xmath64 gives confidence zero to @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in either case , we see that redundancy does not hold .",
    "we provide now a stronger calculus that is sound and complete for this more general case of closure - based redundancy . for clarity",
    ", we chose to avoid the closure operator in our deduction schemes , writing instead explicitly each implication .",
    "our calculus for closure - based redundancy consists of four inference schemes , each of which reaches a partial rule from premises including a partial rule .",
    "two of the schemes correspond to variants of augmentation , one for enlarging the antecedent , the other for enlarging the consequent .",

    "note that this opens the door to using @xmath100 with an empty @xmath2 , and this allows us to `` downgrade '' an implication into the corresponding partial rule .",
    "again , @xmath98 could be stated equivalently as @xmath206 like in section  [ dedplain ] .",
    "in fact , the whole connection with the simpler calculus in section  [ dedplain ] should be easy to understand : first , observe that the @xmath98 rules are identical . now ,",
    "if implications are not considered separately , the closure operator trivializes to identity , @xmath207 for every @xmath16 , and the only cases where we know that @xmath208 are those where @xmath209 ; we see that @xmath200 corresponds , in that case , to @xmath102 , whereas the @xmath100 schemes only differ on cases of equivalence by reflexivity .",

    "the result of substituting a generator for the left - hand side of a rule is equivalent to the rule itself : in one direction it is exactly scheme @xmath201 , and in the other is a chained application of @xmath100 to add the closure to the right - hand side and @xmath98 to put it back in the left - hand side . substituting a generator for the right - hand side corresponds to scheme @xmath200 in both directions .",

    "[ minimality ]    first , we will prove the following intermediate claim : for each partial rule in @xmath228 , say @xmath243 , there is in @xmath145 a corresponding partial rule of the form @xmath244 with @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "we pick any rule @xmath247 , that is , where @xmath1 is a basic @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath2 ; this rule must be redundant , relative to the implications in @xmath111 , with respect to the new basis @xmath145 under consideration : for some rule @xmath248 , we have that @xmath249 which , by theorem  [ closredchar ] , is the same as @xmath250 and @xmath251 , together with @xmath123 .",
    "we consider some support ratios : @xmath252 , which means that @xmath1 is a @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath253 , a closed set including @xmath2 ; by the second condition in the definition of basic @xmath12-antecedent , this can not be the case unless @xmath245 .",

    "now , to complete the proof of the theorem , we observe that each such rule @xmath258 in @xmath145 determines univocally both closed sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 , so that the same rule in @xmath145 can not correspond to more than one of the rules in @xmath228 .",
    "this requires @xmath145 , therefore , to have at least as many rules as @xmath228 .    in applications of @xmath228 , one needs , in general , as a basis both @xmath228 and a basis for the implications , such as the gd - basis . on the other hand , in many practical cases ,",
    "implications provide little new knowledge , most often just showing existing ( and known ) properties of the attributes . if a user is satisfied with the @xmath228 basis , and does not ask for a basis for the implications nor the representative rules , then ( s)he may get results faster , since in this case the algorithms would not need to compute minimal generators , and just mining closures and their supports ( and organizing them via the subset relation ) would suffice .    note that the joint consideration of the gd - basis and @xmath228 incurs the risk of being a larger set of rules than the representative rules , due to the fact that some rules in the gd - basis could be , in fact , plainly redundant ( ignoring the closure - related issues ) with a representative rule .",
    "we have observed empirically that , at high confidence thresholds , the representative rules tend to be a large basis due to the lack of specific minimization of implications , whereas the union of the gd - basis and @xmath228 tends to be quite smaller ; conversely , at lower confidence levels , the availability of many partial rules increases the chances of covering a large part of the gd - basis , so that the representative rules are a smaller basis than the union of @xmath228 plus gd , even if they are more in number than @xmath228 .",
    "that is : closure - based redundancy may be either stronger or weaker , in terms of the optimum basis sizes , than plain redundancy .",
    "sometimes , @xmath228 even fully coincides with the partial representative rules .",
    "this is , in fact , illustrated in the following example .",
    "we revisit the example in figure  [ smallex ] . as indicated at the end of section  [ subsecagyubasis ] , the basis for implications",
    "consists of six rules : @xmath150 , @xmath152 , @xmath151 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 ; the iteration - free basis @xcite and the guigues - duquenne basis @xcite coincide here , and these implications are also the representative rules at confidence  1 . at confidence @xmath156 ,",
    "these are kept and four _ representative rules _ are added : @xmath9 , @xmath160 , @xmath14 , and @xmath161 .",
    "since the four left - hand sides are , actually , closed sets , which is not guaranteed in general , the basis @xmath228 at this confidence includes exactly these four rules : no other closure is a basic @xmath12-antecedent .",
    "however , if the confidence threshold is lowered to @xmath259 , we find seven rules in the  @xmath260 basis : @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath161 , @xmath264 , and @xmath265 , plus the somewhat peculiar @xmath266 , since indeed the support of @xmath267 is above the same threshold ; the rules @xmath9 , @xmath160 , and @xmath14 also hold , but they are redundant with respect to @xmath261 or @xmath262 : @xmath268 and @xmath269 are @xmath12-antecedents of @xmath159 but are not basic ( by way of being also @xmath12-antecedents of @xmath157 ) , whereas @xmath159 is a @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath157 but is not basic either since it is not minimal .    additionally , the sizes of the rules can be reduced somewhat : @xmath13 suffices to give @xmath261 or indeed @xmath270 since @xmath13 is equivalent by reflexivity to @xmath271 and there is a full - confidence implication @xmath150 in the gd - basis that gives us @xmath270 .",
    "this form of reasoning is due to @xcite , and a similar argument can be made for several of the other rules .",
    "alternatively , there exists the option of omitting those implications that , seen as partial rules , are already covered by a partial rule : in this example , these are @xmath150 and @xmath151 , covered by @xmath261 ( but _ not _ by @xmath13 , which needs @xmath150 to infer @xmath261 ) ; similarly , @xmath154 and @xmath272 are plainly redundant with @xmath273 .",
    "in fact , it can be readily checked that the seven partial rules in @xmath260 plus the two remaining implications in the gd - basis , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , form exactly the representative rules at this confidence threshold .      for many real - life datasets , including all the standard benchmarks in the field , the closure space is huge , and reaches easily hundreds of thousands of nodes , or indeed even millions .",
    "a standard practice , as explained in the introduction , is to impose a support constraint , that is , to ignore ( closed ) sets that do not appear often enough .",
    "it has been observed also that the rules removed by this constraint are often appropriately so , in that they are less robust and prone to represent statistical artifacts rather than true information @xcite .",
    "hence , we discuss briefly what happens to our basis proposal if we work under such a support constraint .    for a dataset @xmath21 and confidence and",
    "support thresholds @xmath12 and @xmath274 , respectively , denote by @xmath275 the set of rules that hold in @xmath21 with confidence at least @xmath12 and support at least @xmath274 .",
    "we may want to construct either of two similar but different sets of rules : we can ask just how to compute the set of rules in @xmath228 that reach that support or , more likely , we may wish a minimum - size basis for @xmath275 .",
    "we solve both problems .",
    "we first discuss a minimum - size basis for @xmath275 .",
    "of course , the natural approach is to compute the rule basis exactly as before , but only using closed sets above the support threshold .",
    "indeed this works :    fix a dataset @xmath21 . for any fixed confidence threshold @xmath12 and support threshold @xmath274 ,",
    "the construction of basic @xmath12-antecedents , applied only to closed sets of support at least @xmath274 , provides a minimum - size basis for @xmath275 .",
    "consider any rule @xmath0 of support at least @xmath274 and confidence at least @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath167 is a @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath232 ; also , @xmath276 .",
    "arguing as in the proof of theorem  [ newsoundcomplete ] but restricted to the closures with support at least @xmath274 , we can find a rule @xmath277 where both @xmath278 and @xmath253 have support at least @xmath274 , @xmath278 is a basic @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath253 , and such that @xmath238 and @xmath279 so that it covers @xmath0 .",
    "minimum size is argued exactly as in the proof of theorem  [ minimality ] : following the same steps , one proves that any complete basis consisting of rules in @xmath275 must have separate rules to cover each of the rules formed by basic @xmath12-antecedents of closures of support  @xmath274 .",
    "we are therefore safe if we apply the basis construction for @xmath228 to a lattice of frequent closed sets above support @xmath274 , instead of the whole lattice of closed sets .",
    "however , this fact does not ensure that the basis obtained coincides with the set of rules in the whole basis @xmath228 having support above @xmath274",
    ". there may be rules that are not in @xmath228 because a large closure , of low support , prevents some @xmath1 from being a basic antecedent .",
    "if the large closure is pruned by the support constraint , then @xmath1 may become a basic antecedent .",
    "the following result explains with more precision the relationship between the basis @xmath228 and the rules of support  @xmath274 .",
    "fix a dataset @xmath21 , a confidence threshold @xmath12 , and a support threshold  @xmath274 .",
    "assume that @xmath33 and that @xmath280 ; then @xmath281 if and only if @xmath1 is a basic @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath2 in the set of all closures of support at least @xmath282 .",
    "this proposition says that , in order to find @xmath283 , that is , the set of rules in @xmath228 that have support at least @xmath274 , we do not need to compute all the closures and construct the whole of @xmath228 ; it suffices to perform the @xmath228 construction on the set of closures of support @xmath282 . of course , in both cases",
    "we must then discard the rules of support less than @xmath274 .",
    "we call this sort of process _ double - support mining _ : given user - defined @xmath12 and @xmath274 , use the product to find all closures of support @xmath282 , compute @xmath228 on these closures , and finally prune out the rules with support less than @xmath274 to obtain @xmath283 , if that is what is desired .",
    "consider a pair of closed sets @xmath120 with @xmath284 ; we must discuss whether @xmath1 is a basic @xmath12-antecedent of  @xmath2 in two different closure lattices : the one of all the closed sets and the one of frequent closures at support threshold  @xmath282 .",
    "the properties of being a @xmath12-antecedent and of being minimally so refer to @xmath1 and @xmath2 themselves or to even smaller sets , and are therefore unaffected by the support constraint .",

    "is a basic @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath2 , no proper superset @xmath16 of @xmath2 has @xmath1 as @xmath12-antecedent , whatever the support of @xmath16 ; therefore , @xmath1 will be found to be a basic @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath2 also in the smaller lattice of frequent closures .    to show the converse",
    ", it suffices to argue that , for any proper superset @xmath16 of @xmath2 , if @xmath1 is a @xmath12-antecedent of @xmath16 , then @xmath285 .",
    "indeed , @xmath286 ; hence , if no such @xmath16 is found in the frequent closures lattice at support threshold  @xmath282 , no such @xmath16 exists at all .",
    "whereas our interests in this paper are rather foundational , we wish to describe briefly the direct applicability of our results so far .",
    "we have chosen an approach that conveniently uses as a black - box a separate closed itemsets miner due to borgelt @xcite .",
    "we have implemented a construction of the gd basis using a hypergraph transversal method to construct representative rules of confidence  1 following the guidelines of @xcite and subsequently simplifying them to obtain the gd basis as per @xcite ; and we have implemented a simple algorithm that scans repeatedly the closed sets mined by the separate program and constructs all basic @xmath12-antecedents .",
    "a first scan picks up @xmath12-antecedents from the proper closed subsets and filters them for minimality ; once all minimal antecedents are there for all closures , a subsequent scan filters out those that are not basic by way of being antecedents of larger sets .",
    "effectively the algorithm does not implement the definition but the immediate extension of the characterization in corollary  [ charreprbasisay ] to the closure - based case .",
    "a natural alternative consists in preprocessing the lattice as a graph in order to find the predecessors of a node directly ; however , in practice , with this alternative , whenever the graph requires too much space , we found that the computation slows down unacceptably , probably due to a worse fit to virtual memory caching .",
    "our implementation gives us answers in just seconds in most cases , on a mid - range windows xp laptop , taking a few minutes when the closure space reaches a couple dozen thousand itemsets .",
    ".number of rules in various bases for benchmark datasets . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the basis of this implementation , we have undertaken some empirical evaluations of the sizes of the basis .",
    "we consider that the key point of our contribution is the mathematical proof of absolute size minimality , but , as a mere illustration , we show the figures of some of the cases explored in @xcite in table  [ maintable ] .",
    "the datasets and thresholds are set exactly as per that reference ; column  s / c \" is the confidence and support parameters .",
    "columns `` traditional '' ( for the number of rules under the standard traditional definition @xcite ) and `` closure - based '' ( for the number of rules obtained by the closure - based method proposed in @xcite ) are taken verbatim from the same reference .",
    "we have added the number of rules in the representative basis for implications at 100% confidence `` rrimp '' , that coincides with the iteration - free basis @xcite and other proposals as discussed at the beginning of subsection  [ subscharclosred ] ; the size of the gd basis for the same implications ( often yielding huge savings ) ; and the number of rules in the @xmath228 basis of partial rules , which , in the totality of these cases , did coincide with the representative rules at the corresponding thresholds . as discussed in the end of section  [ mybasissect ] ,",
    "representative rules encompass implications but @xmath228 must be taken jointly with the gd basis , so we give also the corresponding sum .    the confidence chosen in @xcite for this comparison , namely , coincident with the support threshold ,",
    "is , in our opinion , too low to provide a good perspective ; at these thresholds , representative rules essentially correspond to support bounds ( rules with empty left - hand  side ) . to complement the intuition , we provide the evolution of the sizes of the representative rules and the @xmath228 basis for the dataset pumsb - star , downloaded from @xcite , at the same support thresholds of 40% and 60% used in table  [ maintable ] , with confidence ranging from 99% to 51% , at 1% granularity .",
    "the guigues - duquenne bases at these support thresholds consist of  48 and  5 rules respectively .",
    "these have been added to the size of @xmath228 in figures [ pumsbstar40 ]  and  [ pumsbstar60 ] . at these confidence tresholds ,",
    "the traditional notion of association rules gives from 105086 up to 179684 rules at support 40% , and between 268 and 570 rules at support  60% .",
    "note that , in that notion , association rules are restricted , by definition , to singleton consequents ; larger numbers would be found if this condition is lifted for a fairer comparison with the bases we study .",
    "these figures show the advantage of the closure - based basis over representative rules up to the point where the implications become subsumed by partial representative rules .",
    "we want to point out as well one interesting aspect of the figures obtained .",
    "the standard settings for association rules lead to a monotonicity property , by which lower confidence thresholds allow for more rules , so that the size of the output grows ( sometimes enormously ) as the confidence threshold decreases .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath228 basis and the representative rules , some datasets exhibit a nonmonotonic evolution : at lesser confidence thresholds , sometimes less rules are obtained . inspecting the actual rules",
    ", we can find the reason : sometimes there are several rules at , say , 90% confidence that become simultaneously redundant due to a single rule of smaller confidence , say 85% , which does not appear at 90% confidence .",
    "this may reduce the set of rules upon lowering the confidence threshold .",
    "we move on towards a further contribution of this paper : we propose a stronger notion of redundancy , as progress towards a complete logical approach , where redundancy would play the role of entailment and a sound and complete deductive calculus is sought . considering the redundancy notions described so far",
    ", the following question naturally arises : beyond all these notions of redundancy that relate one partial rule to another partial rule , possibly in presence of implications , is it indeed possible that a partial rule is entailed jointly by two partial rules , but not by a single one of them ? and , if so , when does this happen ?",
    "we will fully answer this question below .",
    "the failures of transitivity and augmentation may suggest the intuition of a negative answer : it looks like any combination of two partial rules of confidence at least @xmath12 , but with @xmath227 , will require us to multiply confidences , reaching as low as @xmath287 or lower ; but this intuition is wrong .",
    "we will characterize precisely the case where , at a fixed confidence threshold , a partial rule follows from exactly two partial rules , a case where our previous calculus becomes incomplete ; and we will identify one extra deduction scheme that allows us to conclude as consequent a partial rule from two premise partial rules in a sound form . the calculus obtained is complete with respect to entailment from two premise rules .",
    "we present the whole setting in terms of closure - based redundancy , but the development carries over for plain redundancy , simply by taking the identity as closure operator .",
    "a first consideration is that we no longer have a single value of the confidence to compare ; therefore , we take a position like the one in most cases of applications of association rule mining in practice , namely : we fix a confidence threshold , and consider only rules whose confidence is above it . an alternative view",
    ", further removed from practice , would be to require just that the confidence of all our conclusions should be at least the same as the minimum of the confidences of the premises .",
    "as an example , consider the following fact ( the analogous statement for @xmath288 does not hold , as discussed below ) :    let @xmath289 .",
    "assume that items @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath267 , @xmath290 are present in  @xmath20 and that the confidence of the rules @xmath261 and @xmath291 is above @xmath12 in dataset  @xmath21 .",
    "then , the confidence of the rule @xmath292 in @xmath21 is also above @xmath12 .",

    "completeness is argued by considering any rule @xmath37 entailed by @xmath38 and @xmath341 jointly with respect to confidence threshold @xmath12 ; if the entailment is improper , apply theorem  [ calculussoundcomplete ] , otherwise just apply this new deduction scheme with @xmath382 and @xmath383 to get @xmath384 and apply @xmath201 to obtain @xmath37 .",
    "it is easy to see that the scheme is indeed applicable : proper entailment implies that all seven conditions in case ( 4 ) hold and , for @xmath382 , we get from ( i ) and ( ii ) that @xmath385 ; under this equality , the remaining five conditions provide exactly the premises of the new deduction scheme .",
    "our main contribution , at a glance , is a study of confidence - bounded association rules in terms of a family of notions of redundancy .",
    "we have provided characterizations of several existing redundancy notions ; we have described how these previous proposals , once the relationship to the most robust definitions has been clarified , provide a sound and complete deductive calculus for each of them ; and we have been able to prove global optimality of an existing basis proposal , for the plain notion of redundancy , and also to improve the constructions of bases for closure - based redundancy , up to global optimality as well .",
    "many existing notions of redundancy discuss redundancy of a partial rule only with respect to another single partial rule ; in our section  [ closbasedent ] , we have moved beyond into the use of two partial rules . for this approach to redundancy , we believe that this last step has been undertaken for the first time here",
    "; the only other reference we are aware of , where a consideration is made of several partial rules entailing a partial rule , is the early @xcite , which used a much more demanding notion of redundancy in which the exact values of the confidence of the rules were both available on the premises and required in the conclusion . in our simpler context , we have shown that the following holds : for @xmath369 , there is no case of proper @xmath12-entailment from two premises ; beyond @xmath386 , there are such cases , and they are fully captured in terms of set inclusion relationships between the itemsets involved .",
    "we conjecture that a more general pattern holds .",
    "more precisely , we conjecture the following : for values of the confidence parameter @xmath387 , such that @xmath388 ( where @xmath389 ) , there are partial rules that are properly entailed from @xmath51 premises , partial rules themselves , but there are no proper entailments from @xmath356 or more premises .",
    "that is , intuitively , higher values of the confidence threshold correspond , successively , to the ability of using more and more partial premises .",
    "however , the combinatorics to fully characterize the case of two premises are already difficult enough for the current state of the art , and progress towards proving this conjecture requires to build intuition to much further a degree .",
    "this may be , in fact , a way towards stronger redundancy notions and always smaller bases of association rules .",
    "we wish to be able to establish such more general methods to reach absolutely minimum - size bases with respect to general entailment , possibly depending on the value of the confidence threshold @xmath12 as per our conjecture as just stated .",
    "we observe the following : after constructing a basis , be it either the representative rules or the @xmath228 family , it is a simple matter to scan it and check for the existence of pairs of rules that generate a third rule in the basis according to theorem  [ dospremisas ] : then , removing such third rules gives a smaller basis with respect to this more general entailment .",
    "however , we must say that some preliminary empirical tests suggest that this sort of entailments from two premises seems to appear in practice very infrequently , so that the check is computationally somewhat expensive compared to the scarce savings it provides for the basis  size .",
    "now that all our contributions are in place , let us review briefly a point that we made in the introduction regarding what is expected to be the role of the basis .",
    "the statement that association rule mining produces huge outputs , and that this is indeed a problem , not only is acknowledged in many papers but also becomes self - evident to anyone who has looked at the output of any of the association miner implementations freely accessible on the web ( say @xcite for one ) .",
    "however , we do not agree that it is _ one _ problem : to us , it is , in fact , _ two _ slightly different problems , and confusing them may lead to controversies that are easier to settle if we understand that different persons may be interested in different problems , even if they are stated similarly . specifically , let us ask whether a huge output of an association miner is a problem for the user , who needs to receive the output of the mining process in a form that a human can afford to read and understand , or for the software that is to store all these rules , with their supports and confidences . of course , the answer is `` both '' , but the solutions may not coincide .    indeed ,",
    "sophisticated conceptual advances have provided data structures to be computed from the given dataset in such a way that , within reasonable computational resource limits , they are able to give us the support and confidence of any given rule in the given dataset ; maybe a good approximation is satisfactory enough , and this may allow us to obtain some efficiency advantages .",
    "the set of frequent sets , the set of frequent closures , and many other methods have been proposed for this task ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the surveys @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our approach is , rather , logical in nature , and aimed at the other variant of the problem : what rules are irredundant , in a general sense . from these",
    ", redundant rules reaching the thresholds can be found , `` just as rules '' .",
    "so , we formalize a situation closer to the practitioner s process , where a confidence threshold @xmath12 is enforced beforehand and the rules with confidence at least @xmath12 are to be discussed ; but we do _ not _ need to infer from the basis the value of the confidence of each of these other rules , because we can recompute it immediately as a quotient of two supports , found in an additional data structure that we assume kept , such as the closures lattice with the supports of each closed set .    therefore , our bases , namely , the already - known representative rules and our new closure - based proposal @xmath228 , are rather `` user - oriented '' : we know that all rules above the threshold can be obtained from the basis , and we know how to infer them when necessary ; thus , we could , conceivably , guide ( or be guided by ) the user if ( s)he wishes to see all the rules that can be derived from one of the rules in the basis ; this user - guided exploration of the rules resulting from the mining process is alike to the `` direction - setting rules '' of @xcite , with the difference that their proposal is based on statistical considerations rather than the logic - based approach we have followed .",
    "the advantage is that our basis is not required to provide as much information as the bases we have mentioned so far , because the notion of redundancy does not require us to be able to compute the confidence of the redundant rules .",
    "this is why we can reach an optimum size , and indeed , compared to @xcite  or  @xcite , @xmath228 differs because these proposals , essentially , pick all minimal generators of each antecedent , which we avoid .",
    "the difference is marginal in the conceptual sense ; however the figures in practical cases may differ considerably , and the main advantage of our construction is that we can actually prove that there is no better alternative as a basis for the partial rules with respect to closure - based redundancy .",
    "further research may proceed along several questions .",
    "we believe that a major breakthrough in intuition is necessary to fully understand entailment among partial rules in its full generality , either as per our conjecture above or against it ; variations of our definition may be worth study as well , such as removing the separate confidence parameter and requiring that the conclusion holds with a confidence at least equal to the minimum of the confidences of the premises .",
    "other questions are how to extend this approach to the mining of more complex dependencies @xcite or of dependencies among structured objects ; however , extending the development to sequences , partial orders , and trees , is not fully trivial , because , as demonstrated in  @xcite , there are settings where the combinatorial structures may make redundant certain rules that would not be redundant in a propositional ( item - based ) framework ; additionally , an intriguing question is : what part of all this discussion remains true if implication intensity measures different from confidence ( @xcite , @xcite ) are used ?",
