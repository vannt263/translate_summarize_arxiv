    "in several multi - terminal communication , cryptographic and information processing scenarios , the presence of a gcs krner ( gk ) common part leads to richer strategies and enhanced throughput .",
    "for example , in quantizing @xcite or communicating @xcite correlated sources that are distributed , the gk common part facilitates co - ordination through a common codebook . in communicating private messages over a broadcast channel ,",
    "the gk common part of the induced test channel can be specifically coded to enhance throughput . in this article",
    ", we address the scenario wherein the sources nearly , but not perfectly , have a gk common part , and we develop a strategy to exploit this specific structure of the joint pmf .",
    "our primary focus in this article is the scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : generalproblem ] , wherein a pair @xmath1 of correlated sources have to be communicated losslessly over a @xmath0user mac .",
    "we undertake a shannon - theoretic study of this scenario and consider the problem of characterizing sufficient conditions under which the sources can be communicated over the mac .",
    "this problem was addressed by cover , el gamal and salehi @xcite , wherein a coding scheme ( ces scheme ) that transfers the source correlation into correlated channel inputs is proposed .",
    "the ces scheme outperforms separation , and remains to be the best known scheme for a general problem instance .",
    "while the ces scheme transfers the source correlation into channel inputs via a ` single - letter ' scheme , i.e. , the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 at time @xmath4 is based only on the correlation between the source symbols at time @xmath4 , dueck @xcite , through an ingenious coding scheme designed for a specific example , proves that if one allows channel inputs to extract correlation from a block of symbols , then these can be carefully designed to communicate more effectively over the mac .",
    "thereby , dueck proves that the single - letter ( s - l ) ces scheme is sub - optimal , however his coding scheme is very specific to the example considered therein . in this work ,",
    "we build on dueck s findings and propose a generalized coding scheme .",
    "our contributions also include a performance analysis of the proposed coding scheme which leads us to characterizing a new set of sufficient conditions . in this endeavor ,",
    "we are aided by recent findings of shirani and pradhan @xcite , wherein a closely related phenomenon is identified and exploited for distributed source coding ( dsc ) .",
    "joint source - channel coding has been well studied , both from the perspective of fundamental limits @xcite and computationally feasible strategies @xcite , in several multi - terminal scenarios @xcite .",
    "fundamental limits of performance for transmitting correlated gaussians over gaussian multi - user channels have been studied in @xcite .",
    "following are the primary motivating questions we address in our work .",
    "firstly , why does the flexibility of allowing channel inputs at time @xmath4 to be correlated via a block of source symbols , not just those at time @xmath4 , provide , in general , a more efficient technique for the problem considered herein . in other words , why is the s - l ces scheme sub - optimal ? in section [ sec : explainingdueck ] , we provide a discussion on dueck s findings , and explain why a s - l ces scheme , or perhaps any scheme constrained to transfer s - l correlation , is , in general , sub - optimal .",
    "secondly , can we employ the current known s - l schemes as building blocks in a larger coding scheme and thereby transfer correlation from a block of source symbols onto channel inputs ?",
    "a careful understanding of dueck s coding scheme suggests , as stated in section [ sec : explainingdueck ] , that a concatenated coding scheme , wherein both the inner and outer codes operate in a single letter fashion can accomplish this .",
    "finally , can we characterize the performance of such a concatenated coding scheme ( that is computable ) and compare that to a s - l ces scheme ?    taking a closer look at dueck s findings in section [ sec : explainingdueck ] , we recognize why a s - l ces scheme is sub - optimal .",
    "therein , it also becomes apparent how the specific structure of the joint pmf of @xmath1 ` nearly ' , but not perfectly , possessing a gk common part can be exploited via a concatenated coding scheme involving s - l coding schemes . in section [ sec : sufficientconditions ] , we propose this coding scheme , analyze its performance to derive a computable characterization of a set of sufficient conditions . in doing this , we employ techniques from chaharsooghi and pradhan @xcite , @xcite wherein a similar effort is carried out in the context of dsc . in section",
    "[ sec : sufficientconditions ] , we also prove , via a simple modification of dueck s example , that the derived sufficient conditions can be strictly less binding than those of ces @xcite .    the significance of our contribution is highlighted .",
    "firstly , our study puts forth a new coding scheme for communicating correlated sources over a mac and characterizes a new set of sufficient conditions for transmissibility . through an example",
    ", we demonstrate that the proposed coding technique can strictly outperform the current known best .",
    "secondly , our findings indicate that , even though a s - l scheme might not , in general be optimal for a multi - terminal info - theory problem , one might be able to provide better approximations of performance limits through computable characterizations .",
    "thirdly , our coding scheme indicates that one might be able to approach the performance of multi - letter coding schemes by appropriately stitching together s - l coding schemes .",
