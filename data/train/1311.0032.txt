    "an optical medium is called birefringent if it has two different refraction indices depending on the corresponding polarization of propagating light .",
    "birefringence has various sources .",
    "there are solids that are birefringent without external manipulation since they have one or several optical axes .",
    "the most prominent example for such a material is calcite .",
    "however , birefringence can also be caused by external stress or electric and magnetic fields .",
    "on the one hand , since the publication of the pioneering work by klein and nigam in 1964 it has been known that under certain circumstances even the vacuum itself may become birefringent  @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory teaches us that the vacuum is not empty but filled with a `` soup '' of virtual particles that are created and annihilated again .",
    "that is why the vacuum can be polarized by applying an electric or magnetic field .",
    "adler pointed out that peculiar effects occur for a photon traveling in strong magnetic fields such as dispersion or splitting processes  @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason for this behavior is that a strong external field results in a nontrivial refraction index of the vacuum .",
    "the latter depends on the polarization state of the propagating photon , what can then be interpreted as a birefringent vacuum @xcite .",
    "experiments to detect this kind of vacuum birefringence include pulsed magnetic fields @xcite , optical cavities with macroscopic magnetic fields @xcite , and short pulses of conventional laser systems @xcite . new ideas even involve laser wake field acceleration @xcite and free electron lasers @xcite .    on the other hand , a birefringent vacuum may occur in the context of quantum gravity .",
    "string theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , theories of noncommutative spacetimes @xcite , and quantum field theories on spacetimes with nontrivial topologies @xcite give good arguments for a violation of lorentz symmetry at the planck scale .",
    "since there is still no established theory of quantum gravity available , we have to rely on an effective framework that is suitable to describe lorentz violation at energies much lower than the planck energy .",
    "this framework is called the standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "the sme extends the lagrange density of the standard model of elementary particle physics and of general relativity by all lorentz - violating terms that respect the corresponding gauge symmetries but violate particle lorentz invariance .",
    "each term is made up of standard model fields and lorentz - violating coefficients that determine the amount of lorentz violation and that can be interpreted as fixed background fields .",
    "these fields give rise to preferred directions in spacetime .",
    "some of the lorentz - violating terms of the photon sector lead to a birefringent vacuum .",
    "it was observed that such terms either originate from the breakdown of _ cpt_-symmetry or the dual symmetry of electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the first is associated with maxwell  chern  simons ( mcs ) theory @xcite , whose lagrange density combines a preferred spacetime direction with the vector potential and the electromagnetic field strength tensor .",
    "the latter is connected to modified maxwell theory @xcite , which involves a tensor - valued background field and a bilinear combination of field strength tensors .",
    "the corresponding lorentz - violating coefficients can be bounded , e.g. , by investigating the light of various astrophysical point sources or the cosmic microwave background itself .",
    "this leads to very strict bounds in the order of @xmath0 to @xmath1{gev}$ ] for the coefficients of mcs - theory and @xmath2 for the dimensionless coefficients of modified maxwell theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , for theoretical reasons it is still interesting to gain a better understanding for the birefringent sectors of the sme .",
    "this especially concerns the quantum field theories that are based on such a sector .",
    "mcs - theory has already been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "however this is not the case for birefringent modified maxwell theory .",
    "the goal of the current article is to extend our knowledge of these special kinds of lorentz - violating quantum field theories .",
    "the investigations performed can perhaps be adapted to other birefringent quantum field theories as well .",
    "recently , two articles were published where certain issues on the quantization procedure according to gupta and bleuler were considered for birefringent modified maxwell theory @xcite .",
    "note that birefringent photon dispersion relations also play a role in gravitational physics . in their seminal work from 1980 , drummond and hathrell showed that the classical trajectory of a photon in a gravitational background can be modified when quantum effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "this may lead to birefringence for certain curved spacetimes ( see also the review  @xcite for a discussion of further questions on this issue ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the action of modified maxwell theory",
    "is introduced and its most important properties are reviewed . the theory",
    "is then restricted to the birefringent sector with one nonzero coefficient .",
    "the photon sector is coupled to a standard dirac theory of spin-1/2 fermions to obtain a birefringent extension of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "is dedicated to investigating the modified dispersion relations of the classical theory .",
    "besides , both the phase and group velocities are obtained and discussed . in the propagator and the polarization vectors of the corresponding quantum field theory",
    "are calculated that are used to investigate unitarity in and microcausality .",
    "finally the results are presented in the last section .",
    "calculational details are relegated to the appendix . throughout the paper natural units",
    "are used with @xmath3 unless stated otherwise .",
    "modified maxwell theory  @xcite , which is the _ cpt_-even modification of the photon sector of the minimal sme , forms the basis of this paper .",
    "this theory is described by the following action :    [ eq : action - modified - maxwell - theory ] @xmath4 \\label{eq : lagrange - density - modmax } \\mathcal{l}_\\text{modmax}(x)&= & -\\frac{1}{4}\\ , \\eta^{\\mu\\rho}\\,\\eta^{\\nu\\sigma}\\,f_{\\mu\\nu}(x)f_{\\rho\\sigma}(x ) -\\frac{1}{4}\\ , \\kappa^{\\mu\\nu\\varrho\\sigma}\\,f_{\\mu\\nu}(x)f_{\\varrho\\sigma}(x)\\ , , \\label{eq : l - modified - maxwell - theory}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the field strength tensor of the _",
    "u_(1 ) gauge field @xmath6 .",
    "all fields are defined on minkowski spacetime with coordinates @xmath7 and metric @xmath8 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of the lagrange density of is the standard maxwell term and the second is the modification .",
    "the four - tensor @xmath9 describes a background field , i.e. , it transforms covariantly with respect to observer lorentz transformations but it is fixed with respect to particle lorentz transformations . for this reason the second term violates particle lorentz invariance .",
    "the background tensor @xmath9 is antisymmetric under the interchange of the first two and the last two indices plus it is symmetric when interchanging both index pairs :    [ eq : symmetries - background - tensor ] @xmath10 furthermore it obeys the bianchi identity @xmath11    where the summation runs over cyclic permutations of the rightmost three indices of @xmath9 .",
    "a nonvanishing double trace @xmath12 can be absorbed by a redefinition of the gauge field @xmath6 and , therefore , it does not describe any physics  @xcite .",
    "that is why it is usually set to zero : @xmath13 .",
    "the above mentioned conditions reduce the number of independent coefficients of the background field to 19 .",
    "ten out of these 19 coefficients lead to birefringent photon dispersion laws , i.e. , there are two physical photon modes that have different phase velocities",
    ".    the remaining 9 coefficients result in photon dispersion relations that are nonbirefringent , at least at first order in the lorentz - violating coefficients .",
    "the nonbirefringent sector is parameterized by the following _ ansatz _",
    "@xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a symmetric and traceless @xmath16-matrix . in special cases",
    "the latter matrix is usually constructed with two four - vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) according to : @xmath19 the four - vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 are interpreted as preferred directions in spacetime .",
    "hence , lorentz violation in the minimal sector of the sme leading to nonbirefringent photon dispersion relations is connected to having two preferred directions at the maximum .",
    "for example ,",
    "for the isotropic case of modified maxwell theory one purely timelike four - vector is sufficient @xcite , whereas for the parity - odd sector one purely timelike and one purely spacelike four - vector is needed @xcite .    in a series of papers",
    "it was demonstrated that a modified - maxwell type term in the photon sector can arise in the one - loop effective action of a modified qed @xcite .",
    "the modification is constructed by a nonminimal lorentz - violating coupling between the photon and the fermion plus an axial lorentz - violating term in the pure fermion sector . for the nonminimal coupling term in four dimensions the effective action depends on the regularization procedure .",
    "similar issues arise in the context of the adler ",
    "jackiw anomaly , which is directly connected to the mcs - term in four dimensions .",
    "hence the papers show that such ambiguities occur in a wider class of quantum field theories , i.e. , lorentz - violating theories that lead to modified - maxwell type terms by radiative corrections .",
    "the quantum - field - theoretic properties of the nonbirefringent part of modified maxwell theory have already been studied extensively in several papers @xcite .",
    "therefore , the current article aims at the quantum field theory of the birefringent sector .",
    "the experimental sensitivity for the birefringent coefficients lies at @xmath2 @xcite , which means that they are already tightly bounded . nevertheless , a better understanding of the structure of quantum field theories exhibiting birefringent particle dispersion laws is still of theoretical interest .",
    "the birefringent part of modified maxwell theory can be parameterized by the ten coefficients given in eq .",
    "( 8) of @xcite .",
    "in what follows we choose the framework with the nonzero coefficient @xmath20 and all others , which are not related to @xmath21 by symmetry arguments , set to zero .",
    "this special setup will be investigated throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "note that contrary to the nonbirefringent sector ( cf . )",
    "the preferred spacetime directions playing a role for the birefringent case are not evident . to find them we try to construct our special @xmath9 solely in terms of fixed four - vectors .",
    "since the nonbirefringent _ ansatz _ of already respects the symmetries of the background tensor the following generalized _ ansatz _ is used to match the lorentz - violating coefficients : @xmath22 with the two symmetric and traceless @xmath16-matrices @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the scalar quantity @xmath25 .",
    "the matrices are expressed in terms of two four - vectors analogously to , i.e. , there is a total number of four such vectors denoted as @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "each matrix can contain only one or two different vectors .",
    "for example the first is given by @xmath28 here the indices @xmath29 , @xmath30 may but need not necessarily be equal .",
    "we choose the following set of orthonormal four - vectors : @xmath31 where the first is purely timelike and the others are purely spacelike .",
    "the aforementioned _ ansatz _ is generic enough to match the particular @xmath9 considered .",
    "this is done for all combinations of @xmath26 and leads to the following result :    [ eq : generalized - ansatz - special - case ] @xmath32    consequently , the particular background tensor considered can be decomposed into one purely timelike and three purely spacelike four - vectors according to .",
    "this demonstration was made because of two reasons .",
    "first , it was shown that the well - known nonbirefringent _ ansatz _ of can be generalized for the birefringent sector of modified maxwell theory .",
    "therefore , the nonbirefringend and birefringend sector may have a common underlying structure .",
    "second , with the result obtained it becomes clear that the special part of the birefringent sector , which forms the basis of the paper , is characterized by the single nonvanishing coefficient @xmath21 and the orthogonal set of four preferred spacetime directions given by .",
    "this finding will be used frequently throughout the paper .      to construct a qed extension ,",
    "the photon sector is coupled to standard spin-1/2 dirac fermions with electric charge @xmath33 and mass @xmath34 .",

    "four comments are in order .",
    "first , note that each polarization tensor can be written in a covariant form , which is not possible in standard qed when feynman gauge is used",
    ". this behavior bears resemblance to the parity - odd nonbirefringent case of modified maxwell theory that was studied in @xcite .",
    "possibly it occurs for all theories with birefringent photon dispersion laws where it does not matter whether birefringence appears at first or at higher orders lorentz violation .",
    "second , the sum of both polarization tensors reduces to the standard result ] ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for @xmath100 : @xmath120 where `` truncated '' means that all terms proportional to the momentum four - vector @xmath42 have been dropped .",
    "third , each polarization tensor does not have a standard counterpart for @xmath100 .",
    "observe that the coefficients @xmath121 are equal to zero for a vanishing lorentz - violating parameter .",
    "this does not hold for @xmath122 and @xmath123 , in fact , but these are unphysical and the related terms do not play a role for physical ( i.e. gauge - invariant ) quantities . however @xmath122 neither go to zero for @xmath100 nor they disappear when contracted with a gauge - invariant quantity .",
    "this is not surprising , though , since there is no covariant expression for each tensor in standard qed as mentioned previously .",
    "furthermore these terms are not assumed to lead to any problems .",
    "for the parity - odd nonbirefringent modified maxwell theory similar terms remain in the limit of zero lorentz violation .",
    "however , they were shown to have no importance for physics @xcite due to the validness of the ward identity .",
    "fourth , the functional expressions for both polarization tensors are very similar in contrast to the parity - odd case . for the latter sector",
    "the first polarization tensor had a completely different structure compared to the second .",
    "as a final remark in this section , the polarization vectors of the unphysical modes of can be obtained from the field equations as well .",
    "they are chosen as follows : @xmath124 the polarization vector of the scalar mode @xmath125 is a purely timelike four - vektor whereas the polarization vector of the longitudinal mode @xmath126 points along the propagation direction of the wave .",
    "these properties mirror the characteristics of standard qed .",
    "every well - behaved quantum field theory ought to have to property of unitarity .",
    "this guarantees that no probability is lost in physical processes , e.g. , the scattering of particles .",
    "so far , a bunch of examples for lorentz - violating theories have gathered for which unitarity was proven to hold . on the one hand , mcs - theory",
    "was shown to be unitary as long as the preferred spacetime direction is spacelike  @xcite .",
    "the isotropic and the parity - odd nonbirefringent sector of modified maxwell theory were proven to be unitary at tree level within some range of the lorentz - violating coefficients @xcite .",
    "furthermore there are recent results on the unitarity of special pais  uhlenbeck models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown that unitarity breaks down for timelike mcs - theory @xcite .",
    "these examples shall demonstrate that unitarity is likely to still be valid in a lorentz - violating quantum field theory .",
    "nevertheless it is not something that should be taken for granted and , therefore , it will be investigated in what follows .",
    "there are two methods that can be used to analyze unitarity .",
    "the first is testing the property of reflection positivity ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an introduction of this concept within the framework of lattice gauge theory ) and the second is proving the validness of the optical theorem .",
    "reflection positivity is a condition that has to hold for the two - point function of a quantum field theory in euclidian space to ensure unitarity at tree - level .",
    "it was used in @xcite to prove unitarity for certain regimes of the theories considered in these papers .",
    "the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of a forward scattering amplitude to the total cross section of the particle physics process that results from performing all possible cuts of the respective amplitude .",
    "it is a consequence of unitarity of the @xmath127-matrix of the underlying quantum field theory .",
    "we write the latter as @xmath128 with the identity @xmath129 and the transfer matrix @xmath130 describing the scattering of particles .",
    "if @xmath127 is not unitary it holds that @xmath131 which results in @xmath132 . for this reason a violation of unitarity is supposed to be revealed in the optical theorem .",
    "hence it can serve as a tool to show unitarity at each order of perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore the optical theorem can be used as a cross check for the polarization vectors and the photon propagator what will become clear below .    to analyze unitarity ,",
    "the optical theorem will be used in this paper where the considerations are restricted to tree - level . as an ingredient a suitable particle physics process is needed . in accordance with @xcite",
    "the choice is the annihilation of a left - handed electron @xmath133 and a right - handed positron @xmath134 to a modified photon @xmath135 .",
    "massless fermions are considered so that their helicity is physically well - defined .",
    "we choose this process for a number of reasons .",
    "first , it is a relatively simple tree - level process including a modified photon propagator .",
    "second , it has no threshold , i.e. , its kinematics are not that complicated .",
    "third , it involves fields that are not parity - invariant .",
    "this makes sense to reveal possible issues that may occur in the context of parity violation as the particular birefringent theory considered violates parity .",
    "we neglect the axial anomaly , which is of higher order with respect to the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "if the optical theorem is valid , the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath136 is related to the production cross - section of a modified photon from a left - handed electron and a right - handed positron .",
    "the matrix element of the latter process will be denoted as @xmath137 .",

    "however in the parity - odd case the propagator structure was more involved than for the birefringent case considered here .",
