    "37 com is the primary star of a wide triple system ( tokovinin 2008 ) , but the synchronisation effect plays no role for its fast rotation and activity .",

    "observational data for 37 com were obtained with two twin fiber - fed echelle spectropolarimeters  narval ( 2 m tbl at pic du midi observatory , france ) and espadons ( 3.6 m cfht ) .",
    "we have collected 11 stokes v spectra for 37 com in the period january 2010  july 2010 .",
    "the least squares deconvolution ( lsd ) multi - line technique was applied and the surface - averaged longitudinal magnetic field b@xmath1 was computed using the first - order moment method ( donati el al .",

    "[ fig : zdi ] left ) . also , radial velocity , s - index and line activity indicators h@xmath0 and caii irt ( 854.2 nm ) show significant variations , and clear correlations with each other as well as the longitudinal field .    the zdi mapping ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zdi ] center and right ) reveals that the large - scale magnetic field has a dominant poloidal component , which contains about 88% of the reconstructed magnetic energy .",
    "the star has a differential rotation with the following parameters : @xmath2 rad / d ( the rotation rate at the equator ) and @xmath3 rad / d ( the difference in the rotation rate between the polar region and the equator ) ( petit et al . 2002 ) .",
    "37 com shows simpler surface magnetic structure than the fast rotators v390 aur ( konstantinova - antova et al . 2012 ) and hd 232862 ( aurire et al . in prep . ) and shows more complex structure than the slow rotators ek eri ( aurire et al . 2011 ) and @xmath4 ceti ( tsvetkova et al . 2013 ) , which are suspected of being descendants of ap - stars .",
    "the location of 37 com on the hertzsprung - russell diagram was determined on the basis of state - of - the - art stellar evolution models ( charbonnel & lagarde 2010 ) and the mass is found to be 5.25  @xmath5 , in a good agreement with the literature .",
    "synthetic spectra in the region containing @xmath6cn and @xmath7cn molecular lines were calculated and compared to our spectra in order to infer the @xmath6c/@xmath7c ratio .",

    ", it appears that 37 com is in the core helium - burning phase ."
