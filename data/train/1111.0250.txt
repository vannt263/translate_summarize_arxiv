    "for a measure @xmath5 on the unit interval @xmath6 $ ] we consider its _ bernstein transform _ @xmath7 as well as its _ mellin transform _",
    "@xmath8 these functions are clearly holomorphic in the right half - plane @xmath9 .",
    "the two integral transformations are combined in the following theorem from @xcite about hausdorff moment sequences , i.e. , sequences @xmath10 of the form @xmath11 for a positive measure @xmath5 on the unit interval .",
    "[ thm : htoh ] let @xmath10 be a hausdorff moment sequence as in with @xmath12 . then the sequence @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 is again a hausdorff moment sequence , and its associated measure @xmath15 has the properties @xmath16 and @xmath17    this means that the measure @xmath18 is determined as the inverse mellin transform of the function @xmath19 .",
    "it follows by theorem [ thm : htoh ] that @xmath20 maps the set of normalized hausdorff moment sequences ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) into itself . by tychonoff s extension of brouwer s fixed point theorem",
    ", @xmath20 has a fixed point @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that a fixed point @xmath22 is uniquely determined by the equations @xmath23 therefore @xmath24 giving @xmath25    similarly , @xmath26 maps the set @xmath27)$ ] of probability measures on @xmath6 $ ] into itself .",
    "it has a uniquely determined fixed point @xmath28 and @xmath29    berg and durn studied this fixed point in @xcite,@xcite , and it was proved that the bernstein transform @xmath30 is meromorphic in the whole complex plane and characterized by a functional equation and a log - convexity property in analogy with bohr - mollerup s characterization of the gamma function .",
    "let us also mention that @xmath28 has an increasing and convex density with respect to lebesgue measure @xmath31 on the unit interval .",
    "an important step in the proof is to establish that @xmath28 is an attractive fixed point so that in particular the iterates @xmath32 converge weakly to @xmath28 . here and in the following @xmath33 denotes the dirac measure with mass 1 concentrated in @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath35 , because @xmath36    it is well - known that the bernstein transform of lebesgue measure @xmath31 on @xmath6 $ ] is related to the digamma function @xmath37 , i.e. , the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function , since @xmath38 cf .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath39 is euler s constant .",
    "therefore @xmath40 is determined by @xmath41    the measure @xmath42 is given explicitly in @xcite as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the solution to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the moments of the measure @xmath48 are the reciprocals of the harmonic numbers , i.e. , @xmath49    the purpose of this paper is to study the first elements of the sequence @xmath50 , where @xmath2 is fixed .",
    "the reason for excluding @xmath51 is that @xmath52 . since @xmath28 is an attractive fixed point , we know that the sequence converges weakly to @xmath28 .",
    "the first step in the iteration is easy : @xmath53 because @xmath54    this shows that @xmath55 is the jackson @xmath56-measure on @xmath6 $ ] used in the theory of @xmath0-integrals , cf .",
    "@xcite . it is a @xmath0-analogue of lebesgue measure in the sense that @xmath57 weakly for @xmath58 .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that @xmath59 is a @xmath0-analogue of the measure @xmath48 , and we are going to determine @xmath3 as closely as possible .",
    "we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 is defined as the bernstein transform of @xmath56 : @xmath62 this formula is a @xmath0-analogue of . the moments of @xmath3 are @xmath0-analogues of @xmath63    our main result is the following ( note that the haar measure on the multiplicative group @xmath640,\\infty[$ ] is @xmath65 ) :    [ thm : main ] the measure @xmath3 has a continuous density @xmath66 with respect to @xmath65 on @xmath640,1]$ ] .",

    "furthermore , @xmath70 .",
    "it follows that the behaviour of @xmath66 is oscillatory , and therefore quite different from that of @xmath71 , which is increasing and convex .",
    "in fact , it follows from that @xmath72 see figure 1 and 2 which shows the graph of @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "jackson s @xmath0-analogue of the gamma function is defined as @xmath76 cf .",

    "we mention two other expressions @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the number of divisors in @xmath87 , see @xcite .    in order to replace the mellin transformation by the laplace transformation we introduce the probability measure @xmath88 on @xmath89 which has @xmath3 as image measure under @xmath90 , hence @xmath91 the analogue of theorem  [ thm : main ] about the measure @xmath88",

    "its laplace transform is given as @xmath103 but this shows that is equivalent to the following convolution equation @xmath104    this equation expresses a factorization of @xmath105 as the convolution of the exponential density @xmath98 and an elementary kernel @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",

    "it follows that the symmetrized density    @xmath152    is the fourier transform of the non - negative integrable function @xmath153 and therefore @xmath154 is continuous and positive definite , so @xmath88 is the restriction to @xmath89 of such a function",
    ".    the function @xmath61 defined in is a bernstein function in the sense of @xcite , but not a complete bernstein function in the sense of @xcite , because @xmath155 is not a stieltjes function as shown by formula .",

    "this was done in @xcite , where @xmath159 is defined by @xmath160 the connection is that a normalized hausdorff moment sequence @xmath10 is considered as the element @xmath161 .",
    "since @xmath20 is a continuous transformation of the compact convex set @xmath162 in the space @xmath163 of real sequences equipped with the product topology , it has a fixed point by tychonoff s theorem , and this is @xmath164 .",
    "there is no reason a priori that the fixed point @xmath22 of should be a hausdorff moment sequence , but as we have seen above , the motivation for the study of @xmath20 comes from the theory of hausdorff moment sequences .",
