    "amyloid growth experiments typically follow the appearance of amyloid aggregates or the depletion of monomers as function of time , yielding information regarding the rate of the exponential growth and the length of the lag phase under different protein concentrations at fixed volumes . a hitherto overlooked piece of information that can be derived from these kinetic experiments is the observed variation between experimental repeats , which may hold the key to understanding the early rare nucleation events of amyloid formation  @xcite .",

    "understanding these rare initial nucleation events of amyloid formation and the variability resulting from the stochastic nature of nucleation , therefore , is of paramount importance in the fundamental understanding of amyloid diseases and in controlling amyloid formation .    here , we present a new stochastic protein assembly model with the aim to capture the fundamental features of amyloid self - assembly that includes their stochastic nature , and still allow a fully rigorous mathematical analysis of these processes ( figure  [ fig1v4.jpg ] ) . in this spirit",

    "our results demonstrate how stochasticity at the molecular level may influence the kinetics of the total reaction population at a macroscopic scale depending on the relative rates of nucleation and exponential growth , and on reaction volume .",
    "we also show how new information relevant to any specific nucleated amyloid assembly can be gained in a conceptually simple and clear manner by applying our analytical results to the analysis of published @xmath1 amyloid assembly kinetics data  @xcite .",

    "our approach represents the basis for the development of extensive and tractable stochastic models , which will allow the variability information from amyloid growth kinetics experiments to be used to inform the fundamental molecular mechanisms of the key rare initial events of amyloid formation that may be involved in producing early on - pathway cytotoxic species associated with amyloid disease .    supplemental material at [ url ] presents the mathematical background of these results , in particular the rigorous proofs of the convergence results , the precise mathematical characterization of the variability of the assembly process and , finally , some simulations of these stochastic processes .    :",

    "2 ) have shown that the detail of the reactions of secondary pathways , such as a fragmentation kernel , may have a major impact on the size distribution of polymers , but comparably smaller effects on the timecourse of the polymerised mass .",

    "our model further informed the need for new mechanistic steps or experimental interpretation of the large observed variations in the lag time lengths .",
    "thus , the variation seen in the kinetic traces must be taken into account in addition to the concentration dependent behaviour of the kinetic traces in evaluating and developing mechanistic understanding of amyloid protein assembly processes .",
