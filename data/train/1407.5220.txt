    "in the recent years , the statistical physics techniques have been successfully applied in the description of socioeconomic phenomena . among the studied problems we can cite opinion dynamics , language evolution , biological aging , dynamics of stock markets , earthquakes and many others @xcite .",
    "these interdisciplinary topics are usually treated by means of computer simulations of agent - based models , which allow us to understand the emergence of collective phenomena in those systems .",
    "a challenging interdisciplinary subject is tax evasion dynamics , which is an interesting practical topic to be studied because tax evasion remains to be a major predicament facing governments @xcite .",
    "models of tax evasion were firstly studied by economists @xcite , and more recently physicists became also interested in the subject @xcite ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) . experimental evidence provided by gachter",
    "suggests that tax payers tend to condition their decision regarding whether to pay taxes or not on the tax evasion decision of the members of their group @xcite .",
    "in addition , frey and torgler also provide empirical evidence on the relevance of conditional cooperation for tax morale @xcite . based on these ideas , zaklan _ et al .",
    "_ recently proposed a model that has been attracted attention @xcite . in the so - called zaklan model , the dynamics of tax payers and tax evaders",
    "is analyzed by means of the two - dimensional ising model at a given temperature @xmath6 . in this model ,",
    "each agent @xmath7 may be in one of two possible states , namely @xmath8 ( honest ) or @xmath9 ( cheater or tax evader ) .",
    "a transition @xmath10 ( or a spin flip ) is controlled by the `` social temperature '' @xmath6 and also depends on the nearest neighbors states of the agent ( or spin ) at site @xmath7 .",
    "thus , for low temperatures few spin flips occur and for high temperatures many spin flips occur . in other words ,",
    "tax evaders have the greatest influence to turn honest citizens into tax evaders if they constitute a majority in the respective neighborhood .",
    "in addition , some punishment rules are applied : there is a probability @xmath2 of an audit each agent is subject to in every period and a length of time @xmath3 detected tax evaders remain honest @xcite . in another work ,",
    "the dynamics of the model was also controlled by another two - state model , namely the majority - vote model with noise @xcite , where the noise @xmath0 plays the role of the temperature . in this case ,",
    "similar results were found @xcite , suggesting that the results of the zaklan model are robust .    in this work",
    "we study the tax evasion dynamics by means of a three - state agent - based model .",
    "the agents interact by pairs considering kinetic exchanges of their states , in a way that the pairwise couplings may be positive of negative .",
    "in addition , we apply the punishment rules of the zaklan econophysics model .",
    "our results suggest that above the critical point of the opinion dynamics the tax evasion can be considerably reduced by the enforcement rules . on the other hand , below the critical point",
    "the compliance is high , and the punishment rules have a small impact on the evasion .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the microscopic rules that define the model , and the numerical results are discussed in section 3 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "our model is based on a kinetic exchange opinion model @xcite .",
    "a population of @xmath11 agents is defined on a fully - connected graph , i.e. , each agent can interact with all others . in opposition to what occurs in the zaklan model @xcite , for which the dynamics is governed by the ising model ( i.e. , a two - state model ) , in our model",
    "each individual @xmath7 ( @xmath12 ) carries one of three possible states or attitudes at a given time step @xmath13 , represented by @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamic rules are defined following the opinion model of ref .",
    "each social interaction occurs between two given agents @xmath7 and @xmath16 , and we considered that @xmath16 will influence @xmath7 .",
    "first , this pair of agents @xmath17 is randomly chosen .",
    "then , the state of the agent @xmath7 in the next time step @xmath18 will be updated according to @xmath19\\,,\\ ] ] where the sign function is defined such that @xmath20 and the interaction strenghts @xmath21 are quenched random variables given by the discrete bimodal probability distribution @xmath22    notice that we considered that each agent can in principle interact with all other agents , i.e. there is no specific underlying topology for the structure of the interaction network .",
    "so the model can be viewed as an infinite dimension ( or `` mean field '' ) zaklan model .",
    "this is an almost realistic situation thanks to the modern social and communication networks .",
    "first , let us elaborate upon the nature of the above - mentioned three states .",
    "the state @xmath8 represents a honest tax payer , i.e. , an individual 100@xmath23 convinced of his / her honesty , who does not consider evasion .",
    "he / she is either habitually compliant or he / she is a recent evader who has become honest as a result of enforcement efforts or social norms . on the other hand ,",
    "the state @xmath9 represents a cheater , i.e , an individual who is an evading tax payer . whether a tax payer continues to evade depends on both enforcement and the effect of social interactions .",
    "those two classes correspond to the @xmath24 states of the standard zaklan model @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have considered a third state , @xmath25 , which can be interpreted as an _ undecided _ individual . however ,",
    "notice that the above rules of the opinion dynamics [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) ] impose that for an agent to shift from state @xmath26 to @xmath27 or vice - versa it must to pass by the intermediate undecided state @xmath28 @xcite . thus , an agent that is currently at the state @xmath28 was a honest tax payer ( @xmath26 ) or a tax evader ( @xmath27 ) before .",
    "in the first case , the individual is a honest tax payer and , due to social interactions , he / she becomes a tax payer who is dissatisfied with the tax system , perhaps as a result of seeing others evading without being punished .",
    "he / she is not actively evading , but he / she might if the perceived benefits of doing so exceed the perceived costs . for this group ,",
    "evasion is an option . on the other hand ,",
    "the second possibility is that the agent is a tax evader and , due to social interactions , he / she stops temporarily the evasion because he / she wondered whether it is worth to evade .",
    "this agent is fickle and is not 100@xmath23 convinced of his / her honesty , and thus he / she can become a honest tax payer ( @xmath26 ) or he / she can come back to the tax evader state ( @xmath27 ) , depending on the next interactions with his / her social contacts . the above discussion will become more clear in the following , when we will discuss the interpretation of the competitive interactions @xmath29 .",
    "the pairwise couplings @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) may be either negative ( with probability @xmath0 ) or positive ( with probability @xmath1 ) , such that @xmath0 represents the fraction of negative couplings @xcite . the above process given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) is repeated @xmath11 times , which defines one time step in the dynamics .",
    "in addition to such basic dynamics of the model , after the @xmath11 interactions we have considered a policy makers tax enforcement mechanism consisting of two components , a probability @xmath2 of an audit each person is subject to in every period and a length of time @xmath3 detected tax evaders remain honest , as considered in the zaklan model @xcite . in other words , after the application of the above - mentioned kinetic exchange opinion dynamics , we have considered that each tax evader will be caught by an audit with probability @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", the individual must remain honest for a given number @xmath3 of time steps . as mentioned before , the above rules of the opinion dynamics impose that for an agent to shift from state @xmath8 to @xmath9 or vice - versa it must to pass by the intermediate undecided state @xmath25 .",
    "however , this kind of hierarchy is partially broken when we apply the enforcement rules .",
    "indeed , if a tax evader ( state @xmath9 ) is caught by an audit , he / she changes directly to the honest state @xmath8 and remains in this state at least during the next @xmath3 time steps .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics defined by the kinetic exchange model can be interpreted as follows .",
    "if @xmath29 is positive ( with probability @xmath1 ) , there is a kind of agreement between the agents @xmath7 and @xmath16 . in this case , if @xmath30 the agent @xmath7 is undecided and does not know what is the best choice ( be honest or be evader ) , and thus he / she follows the decision of @xmath16 , i.e. , the state of @xmath7 is updated to @xmath31 . if @xmath32 nothing occurs , and if @xmath33 the agent @xmath7 will become undecided and change to state @xmath34 in the next time step @xmath18 , and he / she can become evader or a honest tax payer in a next interaction . on the other hand , if @xmath29 is negative ( with probability @xmath0 ) , there is a kind of disagreement or mutual disliking between the agents @xmath7 and @xmath16 . in this case , if @xmath32 the agent @xmath7 will become undecided and change to @xmath34 and and if @xmath33 the agent @xmath7 keeps his / her decision . finally ,",

    "the system undergoes an order - disorder phase transition at @xmath4 , with a paramagnetic disordered phase defined by the coexistence of the three states @xmath36 and @xmath15 with equal fractions ( @xmath37 for each one ) .",

    "we have a symmetry of the extreme opinions @xmath41 , i.e. , one of the extreme opinions @xmath42 or @xmath43 dominates the system , with consensus states occurring only for @xmath44 , i.e. , in the absence of negative interactions . on the other hand , for @xmath45",
    "the system is in a disordered `` paramagnetic '' phase characterized by the coexistence of the three opinions , with the fraction of each opinion being @xmath37 .",

    "this is due to the high disagreement among the individuals in the population .    summarizing",
    ", one can see that the presence of undecided agents in the population ( state @xmath28 ) naturally reduces the number of evaders , and the implementation of public policies for punishment can be effective in controlling the tax evasion in the population , either due to fear of the undecided to being caught in an audit ( if he / she become an evader ) , as by the monitoring of the tax evaders .",

    ", we verified that the application of the enforcement mechanism can considerably reduce the tax evasion in the population .",
    "this reduction increases for decreasing values of @xmath0 , which means that it is more difficult to control the compliance in populations with more disagreement among the individuals , i.e. , with a large value of @xmath0 .",
    "we have also verified that the fraction of undecided or undecided individuals , i.e. , agents with state @xmath28 , affects the evolution of the tax evasion .",
    "these agents survive in the population in the long - time limit , which favors the reduction of the tax evasion .",
    "this fact together with the control given by the public policies may lead to low levels of evasion .",

    "<S> in this work we study the problem of tax evasion on a fully - connected population . for this purpose , we consider that the agents may be in three different states , namely honest tax payers , tax evaders and undecided , that are individuals in an intermediate class among honests and evaders . every individual can change his / her state following a kinetic exchange opinion dynamics , where the agents interact by pairs with competitive negative ( with probability @xmath0 ) and positive ( with probability @xmath1 ) couplings , representing agreement / disagreement between pairs of agents . in addition , we consider the punishment rules of the zaklan econophysics model , for which there is a probability @xmath2 of an audit each agent is subject to in every period and a length of time @xmath3 detected tax evaders remain honest . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that below the critical point @xmath4 of the opinion dynamics the compliance is high , and the punishment rules have a small effect in the population . on the other hand , for @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> the tax evasion can be considerably reduced by the enforcement mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the impact of the presence of the undecided agents in the evolution of the system .        </S>",
