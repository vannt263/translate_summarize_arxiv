    "a major open topic in stellar cluster research is whether clusters can host multiple star - formation events or extended star - formation epochs .",

    "longmore et al .",
    "globular clusters , on the other hand , host chemical abundance anomalies within their stellar populations ( e.g. , gratton et al .  2012 ) , and while age spreads can not be discerned at these old ages , some scenarios to explain the anomalies invoke multiple star - forming epochs , spanning tens to hundreds of myr ( e.g. , dercole et al .",
    "2008 ; conroy & spergel  2011 ) , although other scenarios have little or no age spreads ( e.g. , krause et al .",
    "2013 ; bastian et al .",
    "2013b ) .",
    "mackey & broby nielsen  ( 2007 ) constructed a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for ngc  1846 , an intermediate age ( @xmath0  gyr ) massive ( @xmath3 ) cluster in the lmc , and found that the main sequence turn - off region was not well described by a simple stellar population ( ssp ) , but rather was extended .",
    "the authors interpreted this spread as a spread in age of @xmath4  myr and postulated that ngc  1846 was the result of a rare cluster merger , where the two clusters had a @xmath4  myr age difference .",
    "however , subsequent work has shown that the majority of intermediate age ( @xmath0  gyr ) clusters in the lmc and smc display this extended main - sequence turn - off ( emsto - e.g. , mackey et al .",
    "2008 ; milone et al .",
    "2009 ; goudfrooij et al .  2011a , b ; keller et al .  2012 ; girardi et al .  2013 ) , ruling out rare events like unequal age cluster mergers . if interpreted as being caused by age spreads , these results suggest , rather , that star - formation can proceed for @xmath5  myr within massive clusters , and that age spreads of this magnitude should be a common feature in massive clusters .",
    "such age spreads have been searched for in younger massive clusters , where such spreads should be readily apparent .",
    "larsen et al .  ( 2011 ) studied the resolved cmds of six massive ( @xmath6 ) clusters in nearby galaxies , and did not find evidence for age spreads of more than @xmath7  myr ( and being consistent with an ssp in most cases ) .",
    "bastian & silva - villa  ( 2013 ) looked at the cmds of ngc  1866 and 1856 , two clusters with masses of @xmath3 , and ages of 180 and 280  myr , respectively .",
    "no age spreads were found , with upper limits of any potential spreads of @xmath8  myr .",
    "niederhofer et al .",
    "( 2015 ) extended the bastian & silva - villa survey to an additional eight lmc young massive clusters , including ngc  1850 , a @xmath9 , 100  myr cluster , and also did not find any evidence for age spreads .",
    "it is important to note that the ymcs studied so far have current masses ( and escape velocities ) well in excess of the intermediate age clusters that show emstos .",
    "hence , unless extreme cluster mass loss is invoked , the ymcs have the same properties ( or even higher mass and escape velocities ) as the intermediate age clusters that display the emsto features did when they were at a similar age .",
    "finally , bastian et al .  ( 2013a ) examined the integrated spectra ( or resolved cmds ) of @xmath10 ymcs with ages between @xmath11  myr and masses of @xmath12 , looking for evidence of ongoing star - formation , and none were found .",
    "these studies have called into question the interpretation of the emsto feature being due to age spreads .    since age spreads are not seen in ymcs , alternative explanations for the emsto",
    "have been put forward .",
    "bastian & de mink  ( 2009 ) suggested that stellar rotation may cause the emsto feature , as stellar rotation effects the structure of the star and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer will change the effective temperature , hence observed colour .",
    "however , girardi et al .  ( 2011 ) calculated isochrones for a modestly rotating star and found that the extended lifetime of the star , due to rotation , may cancel the stellar structure effects , resulting in a non - extended msto .",
    "platais et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that in the intermediate age ( @xmath13  gyr ) galactic cluster trumpler  20 , that modestly rotating stars were blue shifted from the nominal main sequence , in agreement with the girardi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) predictions , suggesting that stellar rotation may not be the cause of the emsto phenomenon .",
    "however , no rapid rotating stars were present in the cluster , and further studies are needed to confirm this as a general result .",
    "yang et al .  (",
    "2013 ) used the dartmouth stellar evolutionary code to investigate these contradictory results , and found that the mixing efficiency caused by rotation is a key parameter , and that in fact stellar rotation may cause emstos , depending on the specific choice of the rotational mixing parameter .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found that while the young ( @xmath14  myr ) cluster ngc  1844 in the lmc did not have an age spread , its cmd does display features that are not well described by an ssp model , namely a broadened main sequence at similar magnitudes as the emsto in the intermediate age clusters .",
    "hence , as cmds are studied in more detail , new features are still being discovered .    hence , the cause of the emsto is still under debate , with some studies still advocating age spreads as the best explanation ( e.g. , correnti et al .",
    "one way to test the above scenarios is to look for other features in the cmd that may also reflect age spreads .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) introduced the red clump as such a test , showing that the red clump in ngc  419 is more elongated than would be expected in a simple stellar population .",
    "interestingly , trumpler 20 also displays an extended or  dual red clump \" although it does not show any evidence for an age spread within it ( platais et al .",
    "li et al .",
    "( 2014a ) found , on the other hand , that the younger emsto cluster ngc  1831 , has a compact red - clump which is inconsistent with the presence of a significant age spread within the cluster .",
    "it is currently unclear what the role of rotation will be on the red clump morphology .",
    "extra - mixing from rotation would likely give larger core masses , which may result in an extended red clump , however this effect may be compensated by a longer main sequence lifetime .",
    "detailed modelling is necessary to address this .",
    "another feature of the cmd that is sensitive to age spreads is the width of the sub - giant branch ( e.g. , marino et al .",
    "li et al .",
    "( 2014b ) have shown that the sgb width in ngc  1651 , an intermediate age lmc cluster that displays the emsto phenomenon , is consistent with a simple stellar population ( i.e. , with no age spread ) .",
    "the authors place an upper limit of 80  myr on any age spread within the cluster , significantly less than the age spread of 450  myr inferred from the emsto . while the sgb width does suffer from lower numbers of stars than the msto or red clump regions of the cmds , a number of clusters contain enough stars to place strict limits on",

    "we have corrected the observed photometry for extinction , using values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and distance moduli of 18.5 and 18.42 for ngc  1806 and 1846 ( goudfrooij et al .",

    "the values were taken from goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2011b ) , although independent analysis using the present datasets found good agreement .    for our analysis",

    "( 2008 ) , with z=0.008 and y=0.25 . however , we note that the conclusions of this paper are unchanged if we would have adopted the basti ( pietrinferni et al .",
    "2004 ) or the dartmouth ( dotter et al .",
    "2008 ) isochrones with similar parameters .",
    "while the absolute ages of the clusters do depend on the model adopted , the relations between the msto , sgb and rc positions remain unchanged , i.e. if an age spread is present it will show up in the same way in each of the different portions of the cmd .",

    "( blue ) lines show isochrones of age 1.41 ( top ) , 1.58 ( middle ) and 1.86  gyr ( bottom ) , i.e. the range required to explain the observed spread in the msto region .",
    "some of the spread observed in the msto region is due to binaries and photometric errors , hence the isochrones used to bracket the emsto are upper limits to any actual spread within the clusters .",
    "it should be noted that different authors have derived somewhat conflicting age spreads , with goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2011b ) suggesting age spreads of @xmath1  myr for ngc  1806 and milone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggesting a lower value of @xmath17  myr .",
    "we identify candidate sgb branch stars between @xmath18 as ( red ) diamonds .",
    "as can already be seen from the figure , the sgb stars cluster around the youngest isochrone needed to explain the emsto feature , and do not span the full range expected if large age spreads were present in the cluster .",
    "the average photometric errors were derived from the observed main sequence distribution below the msto . to do this we  verticalised \" the main sequence between @xmath19 .",
    "we then made histograms of the stars in @xmath20 in 0.25  magnitude bins , and fit gaussians to the distribution .",
    "while there was clearly a tail of stars to the red ( due to binaries ) the core of each distribution was well described by a gaussian with dispersion of @xmath21  mag .",
    "we took this to be the typical error in colour and correspondingly an error of @xmath22  mag in brightness .",
    "we begin by estimating the age spread present as inferred by the extended msto . to do this",
    ", we take a slice through the data ( shown as the solid red box in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1806_cmd ] ) , and find the best fitting isochrone for each observed star .",
    "this is similar to what was done in goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2011b ; 2014 ) , although we note that we have not attempted to include the effects of binaries in this simple calculation . the resulting age distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1806_age_dist_msto ] .",
    "we then fit a gaussian to the distribution ( shown as a blue dash - dotted line ) to the data , and the best fit parameters are given in the panel .",
    "we will use this age distribution in constructing synthetic cmds to test if other regions of the cmd are consistent with the estimated sfh .",
    "we then generated two synthetic cluster cmds .",
    "the first is the expected distribution if the emsto was due to an age spread ( i.e. adopting the age spread in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1806_age_dist_msto ] ) .",
    "the second was under the assumption of a single age population ( i.e. , an ssp ) with an age of 1.44 gyr .",
    "synthetic stellar populations were then made adopting a salpeter  ( 1955 ) stellar imf and the marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) isochrones , applying representative errors taken from the observations .",
    "stars along the same colour / magnitude region used to define the sgb and the rc in the observations were selected and analysed in the same way as the observations .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendix_test ] we test all the used techniques against synthetic clusters with known ( input ) age spreads .",
    "additionally , we test our relatively simplistic age spread estimate based on the cut across the emsto ( note that this is the same technique adopted by goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 2011b ; 2014 ) ) against a full sfh based on the starfish package .      for the sgb , we can quantify the offset between the observed distribution and that expected from a population with an extended sfh or a single burst .",
    "this is done by measuring the magnitude offset of each observed star ( or a star from our synthetic cmd ) identified as being part of the sgb from a nominal isochrone .",
    "we adopt an isochrone at 1.44  gyr , as this best describes the observed sgb in this cluster , and looked at the difference between each observed sgb star and the nominal isochrone .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1806_age_dist_sgb ] .",
    "we also show the expected magnitude difference between other isochrones and the nominal isochrone as vertical dashed lines ( labelled in the panel ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1806_age_dist_sgb ] , the extended sfh simulation ( the average of 1,000 monte carlo realisations ) fails to reproduce both the peak of the observed distribution as well as the width .",
    "the expected and observed peaks in the distribution are offset by @xmath23  mag .",
    "the ssp simulation well describes the width of the core of the observed histogram , but the observations display extended tails on both sides , suggesting that photometric errors alone can not explain the full distribution . however , we note that the observed spread in the distribution ( corrected for photometric uncertainties ) is an upper limit to the actual spread , as we have not corrected for the effects of differential extinction , nor binarity , in our sample",
    ". additionally , if stellar rotation is affecting the msto then we may expect to see some influence on the sgb , which causes some spread in the observed sgb stars ( e.g. , girardi et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the base of the red - giant branch also appears narrower than would be expected if large age spreads were present .",
    "again , the stars cluster along the youngest isochrone that fits the msto region .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1806_cmd_rc ] we show a zoom in of the cmd of ngc  1806 centred on the base of the red giant branch and the red clump ( rc ) .",
    "additionally , we show four isochrones with ages between 1.31 and 1.77  gyr . as was the case for the sgb",
    ", we note that the position of the observed stars do not conform to the expectations if there was a significant age spread present within the cluster . while a significant spread in colour is expected , there is little spread in observations .",
    "we quantify this in a similar way as was done for the sgb .",
    "we simply assign an age to each of the observed ( and synthetic ) stars based on the closest isochrone .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1806_age_dist_rc ] . note that the rc width is consistent with the expectations of an ssp , while an extended sfh results in a distribution that is clearly at odds with the observations .",
    "the reason why this  pseudo - age distribution \" is not symmetric ( the input age distribution is ) is that the isochrones bunch up at older ages at the rc , so small photometric errors may lead to large age differences .",
    "we have explored the effect of binaries on the sgb morphology , by creating cmds of synthetic clusters with and without binaries . for the binary populations we assume a flat mass ratio and differing binary fractions , ranging from zero ( only single stars ) to 1 ( all stars have binary companions ) . only in the cases of high binary fraction",
    "was the sgb significantly affected , shifting the stars to brighter magnitudes .",
    "for realistic binary fractious we found that the sgb is only marginally broadened by binaries , consistent with the more detailed simulations of milone et al .",
    "( 2009 - their figs .",
    "@xmath24 ) .",
    "the reason for this is the relatively low fraction of near - equal mass binaries in the clusters ( @xmath25% - milone et al .",
    "2009 ) . due to the intrinsic brightness of sgb stars",
    ", low mass companions do not significantly contribute to the combined flux of a binary pair .",
    "due to the relatively short duration of the rc phase in stellar evolution , and the fact that rc stars are much brighter than their ms counterparts , binaries are not expected to have a large effect on the rc position or morphology . only in the rare circumstance that a rc star has an rc star binary companion",
    "would the magnitude be significantly affected .",
    "vertical dashed lines show the expected magnitude difference of different isochrones , labelled in the panel .",

    "the dash - dot - dot ( blue ) line shows the expected distribution adopting the parameters that best fit the emsto region ( assuming that an age spread is the cause ) .",

    "the inferred age from the sgb is that of the youngest isochrone needed to match the emsto , which is @xmath30  gyr , similar to that found for ngc  1806 .    from this we conclude that the sgb morphology is inconsistent with the presence of a significant age spread within the cluster",

    "[ fig : ngc1846_cmd_rc ] & [ fig : ngc1846_age_dist_rc ] it is clear that the rc position and morphology is also inconsistent with the inferred age spread from the msto , being best described by a single isochrone ( an ssp ) . as was the case for ngc  1806 , we again note that we have not included the effects of binarity nor differential extinction ( and also for the potential spread caused by stellar rotation ) , hence any observed spread is an upper limit to the intrinsic spread in the distribution .",
    "additionally , there is likely some amount of stellar field star contamination in the used cmd .",
    "we have also tested our results using different filter combinations ( e.g. , including @xmath33 ) based on new photometry , milone et al .",

    "their fit included the sgb and rc portions of the cmd , as well as the msto , so it could have found an inconsistency between the different cmd regions .",
    "the code , however , is weighted to regions with the most stars , hence was heavily weighted to the msto region of the cmd .",
    "figure  7 of rubele et al .",
    "( 2013 ) clearly shows high @xmath34 values for this cluster at the position of the rc , inferring that the best fitting extended sfh did not reproduce this region , consistent with what we have reported here .",
    "mackey et al .  (",
    "2013 ) have found evidence that ngc  1846 displays systematic rotation , similar in magnitude to the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "one explanation for this phenomenon is that a dynamically colder  2nd generation \" formed with a net rotation within an existing  1st generation \" ( e.g. , bekki  2010 ) .",

    "it is not possible to differentiate between the  1st \" and  2nd generations \" ( only the ",
