    "nowadays it is common to consider deeply virtual exclusive electroproduction of mesons or photons in the context of generalized parton distributions ( gpd s ) @xcite . in the case of deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs )",
    "@xcite , a single initial quark near its mass shell becomes highly virtual after it interacts with the off - shell photon .",
    "this virtual quark propagates essentially without interaction with the quark and gluon spectators until it radiates a real photon . to produce a final hadron in place of a real photon",
    ", the off - shell quark can radiate a hard gluon that enhances its correlation with soft quarks and antiquarks around the target , and hence increases the probability of hadronization into a single meson .    in the language of qcd factorization @xcite , exchange of a single off - shell quark between the interaction point for the virtual photon and real photon ( or meson , in the case of hard exclusive meson production ) corresponds to application of the operator product expansion to a product of electromagnetic currents and/or meson interpolating fields . in the center of mass frame between the initial quark and virtual photon ,",
    "the incoming quark has one large momentum component and is nearly on its mass shell . to obtain amplitudes in terms of generalized parton distributions",
    "it is necessary to ignore the other , small momentum components and quark masses .",
    "an alternative approach to exclusive processes involving strong interactions is based on identifying singularities of the scattering amplitude close to the physical region of the relevant kinematical variables . in particular",
    "one expects physical states with quantum numbers of the @xmath0-channel to dominate processes involving two - to - two particle scattering , @xmath2 at low momentum transfer to the target , @xmath3 and large values of @xmath4 ( the square of the center of mass energy ) @xmath5 .",
    "inclusion of all allowed @xmath0-channel exchanges leads to the regge - type dependence , of the scattering amplitude @xmath6 @xmath7 on the center of mass energy @xmath4 where for low momentum transfer @xmath8 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : astdef ] ) the intercept @xmath9 of the regge trajectory is a positive number less than one ( with exception of diffractive scattering which in this language corresponds to the pomeron exchange ) .",
    "the microscopic picture of exclusive electroproduction suggested by regge phenomenology differs substantially from an explanation predicated on generalized parton distributions .",
    "qualitatively , the regge picture corresponds to virtual photon scattering from quarks in the meson cloud around the bare nucleon , as opposed to the virtual photon scattering from quarks in the core of the nucleon , as implied by the connection between gpd s and the spatial distribution of valence quarks @xcite .",
    "a distinguishing feature of the gpd mechanism is amplitude scaling in terms of bjorken variables , _",
    "i.e. _ at fixed momentum transfer and mass of the produced hadron ( or photon ) the hadronic part of electroproduction amplitudes @xcite is predicted to be a function of @xmath10 , the photon virtuality and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy of the virtual photon in the target rest frame .",
    "furthermore at fixed bjorken @xmath13 qcd makes specific predictions for the leading order large-@xmath14 dependence . in the regge case",
    ", the amplitude is expected to be a function of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "recent results on exclusive vector and pseudoscalar meson production from jlab @xcite and hermes @xcite generally do not exhibit the @xmath14 scaling predicted by qcd . in the case of meson production ,",
    "the @xmath16 cross - section is predicted to fall as @xmath17 with @xmath18 , while jlab @xmath19 production data and hermes @xmath20 data taken in a similar kinematic range give @xmath21 .",
    "earlier data @xcite on @xmath22 production might be consistent with qcd expectations , but these results appear to be softer than the @xmath18 predicted by qcd scaling .",
    "dvcs data from hall a at jefferson laboratory @xcite and hermes @xcite appear to be consistent with the @xmath14-independent amplitude predicted by qcd @xcite , however the available @xmath14 window is quite small , from @xmath23 and within the published experimental errors one can not rule out a power - like dependence of the amplitude , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 as large as 0.25 .",
    "perhaps even more surprising , `` standard '' regge - exchange models have proved successful in describing a variety of differential cross sections @xcite , in the kinematical range where scaling would be expected based on comparisons with deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . as we see it , a fundamental question is whether the success of the regge picture is accidental .",
    "if not , this immediately raises the question of how one can disentangle scattering off the meson cloud from effects of nucleon tomography .",
    "it is well known that regge exchanges also contribute to dis structure functions @xcite , but their contribution is restricted to very low @xmath26 .",
    "once it was realized that regge exchange may play a significant role in exclusive electroproduction , attempts have been made to incorporate regge effects using analogies with dis , _",
    "i.e _ to restrict regge contributions in exclusive electroproduction reactions to low-@xmath13 so that scaling is not otherwise modified @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "it has not been proven that regge contributions should only contribute to exclusive amplitudes in this domain , and in fact in ref .",

    ", we investigate further this issue . in ref .",
    "@xcite we analyzed hard exclusive reactions by examining the high - energy behavior of @xmath0-channel exchange processes . here",
    "we will show that utilization of an @xmath4-channel framework , in which one analyzes the `` hand - bag '' diagrams that are used in extracting gpds , leads to the same conclusions reached in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ we show that in the region of high energy and small @xmath0 , regge effects should make sizeable contributions to hard exclusive amplitudes .",
    "in this @xmath4-channel formalism we are able to explore the interplay between regge behavior in the parton - nucleon amplitude and the hard interaction induced by the virtual photon .",
    "we will show that there are crucial differences between dis and dvcs hand - bag diagrams which make regge components of the soft parton - nucleon amplitude much more pronounced for dvcs than for dis .",
    "we find that the difference between these processes arises when one attempts a collinear factorization of the quark propagators occuring in these processes . in the presence of regge behavior in the parton - nucleon amplitude ,",
    "the dvcs formalism is ill - defined .",
    "we then compute the hand - bag diagram using the full hard quark propagator .",
    "for hard exclusive processes , the divergent terms that are introduced produce a non - analytic , non - scaling dependence on the photon virtuality .",
    "this has the following effect on the hard exclusive amplitudes .",
    "first , the breakdown of factorization means that the soft amplitudes are not universal , but are process - dependent .",

    "we have shown that regge amplitudes should make significant contributions at large values of @xmath268 , and not just at small @xmath268 .",
    "a major result of our formalism is the prediction of scaling violation in these hard exclusive processes . at intermediate energies",
    "the bethe - heitler ( bh ) amplitude is generally substantially larger than dvcs , so dvcs amplitudes must be extracted via their interference with the bh term . a group at hall a in jefferson laboratory  @xcite",

    "they measured the beam - spin azimuthal asymmetry @xcite , which is proportional to interference between bh and dvcs amplitudes . after removing the @xmath14-dependence associated with the bh term , they extracted twist-2 and twist-3 compton form factors which by qcd scaling should be @xmath14 independent . in fig .",

    "our formalism in this paper started with the generic hadronic tensor for dvcs reactions .",
    "this was then expressed in terms of a parton - proton green s function whose regge behavior has been examined in the literature .",

    "we argue that the qcd factorization theorems for exclusive processes @xcite should not be applicable to hard exclusive processes , at least not in the region of small @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the lack of convergence of the residues of the poles in the @xmath111 plane that appear in their derivations .",
    "this is a generic feature due to regge behavior .",
    "thus it appears that the qcd factorization theorems for photon - proton exclusive processes necessitate , in addition to a hard scale @xmath14 , a sizeable momentum transfer @xmath0 .",
    "this occurs because the regge nature of hadron - hadron amplitudes @xcite forces a corresponding behavior on the parton - nucleon scattering amplitude , which generates divergences in the generalized parton distribution functions at low @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 ( or @xmath282 ) increases the intercept of regge trajectories become",
    "negative , and standard collinear factorization then becomes applicable .",
    "thus it appears that momentum transfer will become a crucial parameter in these reactions . at small @xmath0",
    "we predict sizeable effects due to scattering off the meson - cloud of the proton , while at large @xmath0 the dominant effect will become scattering from the quarks in the `` bare '' nucleon .",
