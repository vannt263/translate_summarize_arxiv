    "<S> an infinite hierarchy of layering transitions exists for model polymers in solution under poor solvent or low temperatures and near an attractive surface . a flat histogram stochastic growth algorithm known as </S>",
    "<S> flatperm has been used on a self- and surface interacting self - avoiding walk model for lengths up to 256 . </S>",
    "<S> the associated phases exist as stable equilibria for large though not infinite length polymers and break the conjectured surface attached globule phase into a series of phases where a polymer exists in specified layer close to a surface . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a scaling theory for these phases and the first - order transitions between them .    with the advent of sophisticated experimental techniques @xcite , such as optical tweezers , </S>",
    "<S> to probe the behaviour of single polymer molecules and the explosion of interest in the physics of biomolecules such as dna there is a new focus on the study of dilute solutions of long chain molecules . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore appropriate to ask whether the thermodynamic behaviour of such long chain molecules is well understood over a wide range of solvent types , temperatures and surface conditions . </S>",
    "<S> even if one considers a fairly simple lattice model consisting of a self - avoiding walk on a cubic lattice with nearest - neighbour self - interactions in a half - space with the addition of surface attraction , the phase diagram has not been fully explored . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we examine the _ whole _ phase diagram highlighting a surprising new phenomenon . in particular , we demonstrate new features for large but finite polymer lengths involving the existence of a series of layering transitions at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> separately , the self - attraction of different parts of the same polymer and the attraction to a surface mediate the two most fundamental phase transitions in the study of isolated polymers in solution : collapse and adsorption . without a surface , </S>",
    "<S> an isolated polymer undergoes a collapse or coil - globule transition @xcite from a high temperature ( good solvent ) state , where in the infinite length limit the polymer behaves as a fractal with dimension @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( known as the _ extended _ phase ) to a low temperature state ( _ collapsed _ ) where the polymer behaves as a dense liquid drop ( hence a three - dimensional globule ) . in between these states is the well - known @xmath2-point . </S>",
    "<S> alternately a polymer in the presence of a sticky wall will bind ( adsorb ) onto the surface as the temperature is lowered @xcite . at high temperatures only a finite number of monomers lie in the surface ( _ desorbed _ ) regardless of length even if the polymer is tethered onto the surface , while at low temperatures a finite fraction of the monomers will be _ adsorbed _ onto the surface in the large length limit and the polymer behaves in a two - dimensional fashion ( with a smaller fractal dimension of @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> much theoretical and experimental work has gone into elucidating these transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the situation when both of these effects are at work simultaneously and hence compete has received attention in the past decade @xcite . in three dimensions , four phases were initially proposed : desorbed - extended ( de ) , desorbed - collapsed ( dc ) , adsorbed - extended ( ae ) and adsorbed - collapsed ( ac ) phases . in the ac phase the polymer </S>",
    "<S> is absorbed onto the surface and behaves as a two - dimensional liquid drop . </S>",
    "<S> recently a new low - temperature ( surface ) phase named surface - attached globule ( sag ) @xcite has been conjectured from short exact enumeration studies and the analysis of directed walk models @xcite . in this phase </S>",
    "<S> the polymer would behave as a three - dimensional globule but stay relatively close to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the claim is that there is not a bulk phase transition between dc and sag ( if sag exists ) in that the free energy of sag and dc are the same . </S>",
    "<S> however , the number of surface monomers would scale as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of monomers , rather than the @xmath6 as normally occurs in the desorbed state @xcite .    to explore the phase diagram it is natural to conduct monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> however the scale of the endeavour becomes clear for even small system sizes ( polymer lengths ) because one is required to scan the entire two - energy parameter space of self - attraction and surface attraction . </S>",
    "<S> even if once fixes one of the parameters , the study of the properties of the model as the other parameter is varied usually requires many simulations . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately a recently developed algorithm @xcite , flatperm , is able to collect the necessary data in a _ </S>",
    "<S> single _ simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the power of this approach can not be underestimated . </S>",
    "<S> we have utilised flatperm to simulate a self - avoiding walk model of a polymer with both self - attraction and surface attraction that allows us to calculate quantities of interest at essentially _ any _ values of the energies . </S>",
    "<S> this was done with one very long simulation run for polymer lengths up to length @xmath7 and also in multiple shorter cpu time runs , up to polymer length @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we used a beowulf - cluster to run these multiple simulations simultaneously with different random number ` seeds ' . </S>",
    "<S> this allowed us to gain some estimate of statistical errors .    </S>",
    "<S> the model @xcite considered is a self - avoiding walk in a three - dimensional cubic lattice in a half - space interacting via a nearest - nearest energy of attraction @xmath9 per monomer - monomer _ </S>",
    "<S> contact_. the self - avoiding walk is attached at one end to the boundary of the half - space with surface energy per monomer of @xmath10 for _ visits _ to the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of a configuration @xmath11 of length @xmath5 is given by @xmath12 and depends on the number of non - consecutive nearest - neighbour pairs ( contacts ) along the walk @xmath13 and the number of visits to the planar surface @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> for convenience , we define @xmath15 and @xmath16 for temperature @xmath17 and boltzmann constant @xmath18 . the partition function is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> it is this density of states that is estimated directly by the flatperm simulation . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm grows a walk monomer - by - monomer starting on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain data for each value of @xmath5 up to @xmath21 , and all permissible values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the growth is chosen to produce approximately equal numbers of samples for each tuple of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the equal number of samples is maintained by pruning and enrichment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for each configuration we have also calculated the average height above the surface . instead of relying on the traditional specific heat we have instead calculated , for a range of values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the matrix of second derivatives of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 and from that calculated the two eigenvalues of this matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a clear picture of the phase diagram and allows for the accurate determination of the multicritical point @xcite that exists in the phase diagram ( see figure 1(a ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin our discussion by showing a plot obtained from one run of the flatperm algorithm for @xmath7 in the region of parameter space that has been investigated in previous works , namely @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see figure 1(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundaries seen by vrbov and whittington @xcite are clearly visible with four phases in existence . for small @xmath23 and @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> the polymer is in a desorbed and expanded phase ( de ) . for larger @xmath24 adsorption </S>",
    "<S> occurs into the ae phase while for larger @xmath23 a collapse transition occurs into a phase described as the dc by vrbov and whittington @xcite and either sag or dc by singh , giri and kumar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see little evidence for two phases in this region but given that the sag / dc phase boundary is not a bulk phase transition this is not totally surprising !    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the power of the flatperm method is that it allows us to explore regions of parameter space usually unavailable to canonical approaches and so we can consider a much wider range of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> of course the price paid is that the polymer lengths attainable are restricted due to both computer memory required and time needed to produce the samples . in figure 1(b ) we consider @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    to understand what is going on </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the mean density of surface contacts @xmath30 ( _ coverage _ ) as a function of @xmath24 at fixed @xmath31 for various values of @xmath5 up to @xmath8 ( figure [ coverage ] ) . for small @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> the coverage is a slowly varying function of @xmath24 and stays that way as @xmath5 increases . for @xmath24 larger than approximately @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> the coverage converges to a plateau of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> so for @xmath33 essentially all the monomers are in the surface and the polymer should behave in a two - dimensional fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the maximum coverage regime ( fully adsorbed ) is quite sharp and reflects a first order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit : we shall confirm this inference below . </S>",
    "<S> the new phenomenon concerns intermediate values of @xmath24 where other plateaus form at around a coverage of @xmath34 and , for larger @xmath5 , also at @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from one plateau to another moves towards @xmath23 as @xmath5 increases and also becomes sharp . </S>",
    "<S> we can interpret these intermediate `` phases '' as situations where the polymer is distributed roughly equally amongst a number of layers . for example when the coverage is @xmath34 the polymer exists equally on the surface and in the layer one unit above the surface . as @xmath5 increases more and more _ layer phases _ appear where the polymer exists in the first @xmath36 layers above the substrate .     </S>",
    "<S> versus @xmath24 at @xmath31 for lengths @xmath37 ( left to right ) with statistical error estimated as shown.__,width=287 ]    to confirm this picture let us consider the mean height of monomers above the surface @xmath38 in figure [ height ] for the same value of @xmath31 . assuming a uniform density across layers , the mean number of layers that the polymer subtends , @xmath39 , can be deduced . </S>",
    "<S> we have also estimated the end - point position and the maximum height of the polymer , and the data agrees very well with this assumption . </S>",
    "<S> the average height can be seen to decrease as @xmath24 is increased in a series of plateaux corresponding to the plateaux of coverage . </S>",
    "<S> for the range of @xmath24 where the coverage is approximately @xmath34 the average height is almost exactly @xmath40 and the maximum height of a monomer is @xmath32 ( two layers ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the average number of layers is 2 , just as our hypothesis predicts .     </S>",
    "<S> ( right axis ) versus @xmath24 at @xmath31 for lengths @xmath37 ( left to right ) with statistical error estimated as shown . on the left vertical axis the corresponding average layer number @xmath41 ( assuming uniform density ) . </S>",
    "<S> _ , width=287 ]    to explain the phenomenon of the layering seen above let us examine the zero - temperature situation . for positive self - attraction and surface attraction the polymer will take on some compact configuration touching the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> consider a hamiltonian ( fully compact ) configuration of fixed height @xmath36 tethered to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , consider a rectangular parallelepiped with square cross - section parallel to the surface of side - length @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we have @xmath43 and the total energy @xmath44 ( ignoring contributions from edges and corners ) for a @xmath36-layer configuration is @xmath45 the energy can be minimised for fixed @xmath5 when @xmath46 since the system can only have integer values of @xmath36 , a particular integer value of @xmath47 will be stable for a range of @xmath10 of size @xmath48 . the ac phase , using this argument , which is given by @xmath49 , is stable for @xmath50 and for some values of @xmath51 given by the relation ( [ optimumlayer ] ) . as @xmath10 is increased at fixed @xmath9 the system s energy is minimised by smaller values of @xmath36 . at a fixed value of @xmath10 the difference between the energies of @xmath52-layers and @xmath36-layers scale as @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be argued that non - uniform layers are not stable ( consider the total surface area of a block of smaller width on top of an @xmath36-layer system ) so that the system jumps from @xmath52-layers to @xmath36-layers at some value of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we deduce that when the system swaps from @xmath52-layers to @xmath36-layers there will be a jump in the internal energy . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this will be rounded by entropic effects at finite temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> the relation ( [ optimumlayer ] ) based on the zero - temperature energy argument predicts that the transitions coalesce at @xmath54 as @xmath5 tends to @xmath55 . for finite temperatures </S>",
    "<S> the position of the transition need not be exactly @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote the infinite @xmath5 limit transition as occurring at @xmath56 the thermodynamic limit will realise a sharp bulk first - order phase transition at @xmath57 . at finite polymer lengths each of the layering transitions are rounded versions of the zero - temperature jumps in the internal energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence the layering transitions should be rounded first - order type transition with specific heat that grows linearly with system size and a transition width that is @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> note that since the layer phases are stable for segments of the @xmath24 line of the order of @xmath59 and the transitions take place in a region of @xmath24 of the order of @xmath60 , the transitions become sharper as @xmath5 increases . </S>",
    "<S> finally , if we consider sitting at fixed value of @xmath24 close to @xmath23 and increase the polymer length , we should see a set of layering transitions between phases of layer @xmath36 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have tested the conclusions of the above argument . at @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the position of the thermodynamic limit transition to the ac phase ( ie 1-layer phase ) to be @xmath63 by extrapolating the peaks of the fluctuations in the number of surface contacts for the strongest transition ( ie from 2-layers to 1-layer ) against @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ scale - dom ] shows a scaling plot of the logarithm of the fluctuations per monomer divided by @xmath5 in the number of surface contacts against @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for convenience we use the logarithm to display the needed scale . ) </S>",
    "<S> the range includes the peaks from the 1-layer to 2-layers transition , the 2-layers to 3-layers transition and the 3-layers to 4-layers transition . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the scaling collapse of the height and shift of the layering transitions from @xmath36-layers to @xmath61-layers as @xmath24 is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> the shifts of the peaks of all three transitions scale towards the same estimate of @xmath65 when using this same scale , @xmath59 .     in the number of surface contacts at @xmath31 with </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal axis scaled as @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath67 . shown </S>",
    "<S> are lengths @xmath68.__,width=272 ]    the width of the transitions can also be shown to scale with @xmath60 , re - enforcing the hypothesis of first order transitions .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the fundamental model of collapsing and adsorbing polymers in three dimensions contains a new phenomenon at low - temperatures ; at finite polymer lengths a series of ( rounded ) layering transitions exist . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions increase in number and become sharper as the polymer length increases . </S>",
    "<S> we note that while this model is a lattice model , low temperature layering transitions have been seen in off - lattice models @xcite and arise due to the types of compact configurations that can occur in the idealised or physical polymer . the ability to coat a surface with a fixed thickness of polymer may have experimental and technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a theoretical framework based on zero - temperature energy arguments which explain these transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments predict that the transitions coalesce in the infinite length limit to leave a transition between a collapsed , but not macroscopically adsorbed , polymer and a collapsed polymer which is fully adsorbed . </S>"
