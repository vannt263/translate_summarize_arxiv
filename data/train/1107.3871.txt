    "<S> the high - energy tail of the distribution of solute - solvent interaction energies is poorly characterized for condensed systems , but this tail region is of principal interest in determining the excess free energy of the solute . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce external fields centered on the solute to modulate the short - range repulsive interaction between the solute and solvent . </S>",
    "<S> this regularizes the binding energy distribution and makes it easy to calculate the free energy of the solute with the field . </S>",
    "<S> together with the work done to apply the field in the presence and absence of the solute , we calculate the excess chemical potential of the solute . </S>",
    "<S> we present the formal development of this idea and apply it to study liquid water .            </S>",
    "<S> the excess chemical potential , @xmath0 , of a solute ( @xmath1 ) within a general thermodynamic system ( the solvent ) is that part of the gibbs free energy that would vanish if the interaction between the solute and solvent were to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the excess chemical potential is of most interest in understanding a complex system on a molecular basis . since the excess chemical potential is measurable , calculating it also serves as an important validation of molecular simulations .    in this communication </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new approach to calculate @xmath0 , one that sidesteps the current dominant paradigm based on alchemically changing solutes . </S>",
    "<S> our approach , a generalization of the quasichemical organization @xcite of the potential distribution theorem @xcite , rests on appreciating and exploiting the different energies with which a solute interacts with a solvent at different spatial scales . </S>",
    "<S> the approach leads to a transparent accounting of the hydration thermodynamics and is readily applicable to systems modeled by _ ab initio _ potentials or molecularly complex solutes such as proteins . in this communication </S>",
    "<S> we present our results for liquid water modeled by both empirical and _ ab initio _ potentials . </S>",
    "<S> studies on a protein modeled by empirical potentials and of aqueous ions modeled by _ ab initio _ potentials will be presented in subsequent articles .    to appreciate the need for alchemical approaches , consider the formal relation between @xmath0 and solute - solvent interactions @xcite :    [ eq : mudefn ] @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the interaction energy of the solute ( x ) with the solvent . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath13 is the density distribution when the solute and the solvent are thermally uncoupled , with @xmath14 denoting averaging in this instance .    for condensed systems the high-@xmath11 tail of @xmath10 or the low-@xmath11 tail of @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> are rarely well sampled and thus using either of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : mudefn ] usually fails . </S>",
    "<S> it is for this reason that @xmath0 is often calculated by accumulating the work done in slowly transforming a solute from a noninteracting solute to a fully interacting solute . however , </S>",
    "<S> such alchemical transformations pose conceptual challenges in the context of _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> simulations ; an intermediate solute with fractional charge ( and uncertain spin state ) can prove troublesome within quantum chemical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , using _ ab initio _ simulations , an alchemical approach was used to calculate the hydration free energy of some cations , but the same approach could not be used for a chloride anion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the broader applicability of alchemical approaches within _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> simulations remains unknown , and in particular , we are unaware of a similar study for the hydration free energy of a water molecule .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to alchemical transformations , our strategy is to regularize the @xmath10 distribution by imposing a constraint @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the constraint is an external field @xmath15 centered on the particle such that in the presence of this field the solute - solvent interactions are better behaved . using the well - known rule of averages ( for example , see @xcite ) , @xmath16 for any potential @xmath17 and the mechanical variable @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes averaging when the solvent evolves in the presence of the additional potential @xmath17 , we can show that @xmath20 the quantity , @xmath21 , is the negative of the work done to apply @xmath22 in the solute - solvent system ; @xmath23 is the work done to apply @xmath22 in the neat solvent system ; and @xmath24 is the interaction free energy of the uncoupled solute with the solvent in the presence of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that whereas @xmath25 can prove challenging to estimate because of close solute - solvent contacts , @xmath24 is expected to be more amenable to a direct estimation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if @xmath22 is chosen such that the regularized binding energy distribution @xmath26 is a gaussian of mean @xmath27 and variance @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 the first two terms on the right - hand side of eq .  [ eq : genqc ] can be obtained using thermodynamic integration , but the solute - solvent hamiltonian is unchanged , an obvious advantage in _ ab initio _ simulations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath31 varies between zero to its final value as the parameter @xmath32 is varied from zero to @xmath33 , then @xcite @xmath34 where the ensemble averaging is in the presence of the field at the current value of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : genqc ] is a generalization of the quasichemical approach  @xcite for any external field @xmath22 . in the original quasichemical development @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , solvent molecules were strictly excluded from a sphere of radius @xmath33 around the solute . in the present notation , </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to applying the field @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distance between the solvent and the solute . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 is the probability of observing zero solvent molecules in a coordination sphere of radius @xmath33 around the solute , @xmath38 is the probability of observing an empty cavity of radius @xmath33 in neat water , and @xmath39 is the contribution to the free energy due to the interaction of the solute with the solvent outside the coordination sphere . for solutes that interact strongly with water or for solutes with complicated molecular shape , obtaining @xmath40 and @xmath41 can prove difficult , especially for a large cavity radius @xcite . the flexibility to choose any field and the thermodynamic integration method ( eq .  [ eq : ti ] ) </S>",
    "<S> both alleviate this difficulty within the context of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : genqc ] . in analogy to the original quasichemical notation , since the fields used here ( eqs .  [ eq : phi ] ) model soft - cavities , we rewrite eq .  </S>",

    "<S> before presenting the simulation details , we note that a variant of the quasichemical approach with a soft - cutoff has been presented recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that approach uses a probabilistic model to partition solvent between the inner shell ( @xmath46 ) and the bulk and is thus rather different from the approach here .    </S>",

    "<S> we simulate a cubic box of 512 spc / e @xcite water molecules at a temperature of 298  k using a langevin thermostat and a pressure of 1  bar using a langevin barostat @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to the specification of the external force @xmath49 in namd , the external potential @xmath22 is provided as an input to the cp2k code . since the code calculates the force by differentiating an interpolation function of the potential , we use a non - zero @xmath45 parameter in @xmath56 ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ramp ] ) to ensure forces are well - behaved at the cavity boundary .    </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the liquid at a density of 0.997 g/@xmath57 ( number density of 33.33 nm@xmath58 ) and a temperature of 350 k. the system contains 64 water molecules . </S>",
    "<S> to sample the nvt ensemble , we use the hybrid monte carlo method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the initial configuration is taken from a previous md simulation with the same functional  @xcite . during the first 500 sweeps , </S>",
    "<S> the time step for integrating the equations of motion was adjusted to provide an acceptance ratio of 70% . </S>",
    "<S> then the time step was fixed and the system equilibrated for another 500 sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> ( one sweep of the hmc comprises 50 molecular dynamics time steps . )    for estimating @xmath59 , a chain of hmc simulation starting at @xmath51  and going up to @xmath60   in increments of 0.25  was performed . during the construction of the chain , at each @xmath33 we performed 300 sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , for calculating averages , simulations at each @xmath33 were extended for another 1200 sweeps . for estimating @xmath61 , a similar strategy is used but with @xmath62  to @xmath63  . for both @xmath59 and @xmath61 , from the total of 1500 sweeps per @xmath33 , we use the last 1000 for analysis .    to compute @xmath53 , we chose the last 1000 configurations . </S>",
