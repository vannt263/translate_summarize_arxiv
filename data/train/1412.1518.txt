    "cell to cell contacts define key chemical pathways that articulate immune response signaling through cellular signal transduction  @xcite .",
    "signals are transported in the event of attached integrin - ligand pairs , whereupon they are carried through intracellular signaling pathways .",
    "such bio - mechanical signaling , mediated by surrounding coreceptor molecules ( cd4 , cd8 , cd45 ) proliferates an immune response in the body through cellular level interactions @xcite , often resulting in the formation of the immunological synapse ( is ) bond between the immune cells ( t & b cells ) and the antigen presenting cells ( apc ) . in t - cells , some of these signaling pathways are directed toward the nucleus , where conformal changes lead to cell proliferation and triggering of the immune effector functions .    the t - cell : apc bond , a `` close contact '' patch between the membranes , is known to have a diameter @xmath710 @xmath8 m and contains a large number of membrane bound molecules  @xcite .",
    "important cell surface molecules on the t - cell include the t - cell receptor ( tcr ) and the leukocyte function associated-1 adhesion molecule ( lfa-1 ) .",
    "the t - cell receptor ( tcr ) binds with peptide bound major histocompatibility complexes ( pmhc ) on the apc .",
    "similarly , the integrin lfa-1 molecule has a natural ligand in the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( icam-1 ) on the apc surface .",
    "nascent tcr : pmhc and lfa-1:icam-1 bonds begin to form following the initial cellular attachment .",
    "fluorescent tagging reveals heterogeneous segregation and aggregation of the surface molecules throughout the interface @xcite , a result that is attributed to the presence of multiple length scales ( @xmath714 - 15 nm for tcr : pmhc and @xmath740 - 45 nm for lfa-1:icam-1 @xcite ) leading to the dynamic reorganization of the cell surface molecules as a pathway towards is formation @xcite .",
    "initially , the longer bonds ( lfa-1:icam-1 ) localize at the centre of the contact zone , with small patches of shorter bonds ( tcr : pmhc ) toward the edge of the contact zone .",
    "such nonlinear patterning have been studied in details @xcite with theoretical models convincingly proving that the dynamical reorganization is the result of the presence of multiple length scales in the problem along with descriptions of conditions in which such changes in receptor configurations @xcite occur . in what follows",
    ", we will use this fact as an input but otherwise focus on a different aspect of quantifying the strength of the immunological synapse bond that was beyond the scope of either of these papers .    from the binding assay measurements ,",
    "we know that the affinity of the tcr - pmhc complex may vary drastically depending on the proliferated peptide , tcr sequences and the mhc allele .",
    "what triggers the sequential patterning process leading primarily to the aggregation - segregation mechanism , followed by binding of the is bond , are defined by the binding energies of the respective of the emergent synapse .",
    "while such a binding affinity is not exactly proportional to the separation length of the individual cell membranes , it has now been proved @xcite that the tcr : pmhc interaction has to be long enough to complete proximal signalling while the dissociation rates have to be sufficiently short to allow multiple tcrs engaging with the same pmhc . as explained in @xcite , following an initial clustering of the tcrs on the cell surface , affinity rates are affected by the average `` dwell times '' with affinity increasing monotonically as dwell times up to a threshold followed by a saturation regime ; so while it would be ideal to model the tcr : pmhc interaction with affinity as the switch , defining the average dwell time as our regulation `` order parameter '' allows for more direct theoretical modelling of the is dynamics and in turn the patterning process . at this minimalist level",
    ", we are considering only one - no - one tcr - pmhc interactions which is why tcr intensity resulting from the aggregation on the cell membranes will only linearly affect the is kinetics .    the early patterning signals cause polarization of the microtubule organizing centre , effectively stopping t - cell migration and orienting the internal machinery toward the contact area . at a time scale of up to 5 minutes , the pattern inverts such that the tcr : pmhc bonds migrate to the centre of the initial `` close contact '' patch and the lfa-1:icam-1 bonds form a tight adhesion ring around the periphery @xcite .",
    "such a _ pattern inversion _ is strictly a `` non - universal '' feature , since dynamic interactions ( kinapses ) between the cells are also shown to initiate immune effector functions  @xcite .",
    "it has been largely recognized that the mature synapse is required to trigger the immune effector function @xcite .",
    "a primary objective of this study is to focus on the kinetic behavior at the start of this dynamical bond formation process . when the tcr is attached to an agonist pmhc , intracellular signaling molecules can phosphorylate the cytoplasmic portion of the tcr and signal transduction occurs .",
    "however , it is not well understood if signaling continues after the tcr has disengaged from the pmhc , although some studies indicate this may be possible  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also identified tcr microclusters , small patches of membrane enriched in tcr and signaling molecules , continuously forming at the periphery of the synapse throughout the contact duration@xcite .",
    "signaling from these microclusters peaks while in the periphery and diminishes as they migrate toward the centre of the synapse .",
    "the time dynamics of these signals are in the order of seconds , consistent with upregulation of ca@xmath9 levels , before the synapse matures minutes later  @xcite .",
    "the strength and start time of the is bond patterning is defined by the average time the two randomly forced ( due to thermal fluctuations ) fluctuating membranes ( t cell & apc ) remain in contact with each other above a minimum threshold @xmath10 that is defined by the bond lengths of the participating molecules , a model that was successfully implemented previously @xcite in estimating the average lengths scale of the interacting t cell : pmhc patch sizes . in line with the chattopadhyay - burroughs model @xcite , here we analyze the average time of contact of these `` close contact '' patches , at the start of patterning , based on an analogous one membrane - two threshold model ( theoretical architecture follows @xcite ) .",

    "as shown in @xcite , incorporation of the first nonlinear ( cubic ) perturbation in the linearized ( stochastic ) model predicts a hopf - bifurcation point below which the linear regime dominates and above which nonlinear patterning @xcite takes over .",
    "our focus here is to study the crossover from the linear to the nonlinear regime .",

    "the parlance used previously as well as in @xcite , this can be represented by an estimation of the time persistence between two threshold values , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the t cell analogue of the tcr : pmhc bond length ( @xmath7 15 nm ) while @xmath6 symbolizes the icam-1:lfa-1 bond separation length ( @xmath7 45 nm ) .",

    "the time persistence initially increases as @xmath3 increases , then it saturates and asymptotically approaches the @xmath83 value . as @xmath84 the average time persistence tends toward the smallest time length scale used , for our case @xmath85 .",
    "once again , a quantitative understanding of figure  [ fig : tb_vs_delta ] can be had from the fact that an increase in the @xmath3 value can be wrought about in either of the two possible ways - an increase in @xmath6 for fixed @xmath5 , or else a decrease in @xmath5 for a fixed @xmath6 .",
    "for the first case when @xmath6 increases at a fixed @xmath5 , it is easier for a fluctuation mode to remain within the upper limit ( @xmath6 ) than to cross it while for the second case , with a fixed value of the upper threshold @xmath6 , a lowering of @xmath5 increases the probability of a fluctuation mode crossing this line resulting in an increased value of @xmath86 .",
    "figures  [ fig : tplus_vs_delta ] and [ fig : tb_vs_delta ] respectively express the variation of the average `` persistent times '' against bond lengths above a critical threshold and that in between two thresholds ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . these results are subsets of a bigger ensemble defined by a membrane that fluctuates across two thresholds @xmath5 and @xmath6 , or else that of two membranes whose fluctuations are measured across a single threshold @xmath10 , that , as already explained earlier , are equivalent analytical descriptions . in line with our model of a single membrane",
    "fluctuating across two threshold detailed in the previous section and as depicted in figure  [ fig : t_regions1 ] , the statistics can be classified in to four broad zones - `` 11 '' , `` 12 '' , `` 21 '' and `` 22 '' .",
    "while `` 11 '' defines the fluctuation regime for a crossing from a region in @xmath87 across the line @xmath88 but for @xmath89 , `` 22 '' encapsulates the complementary regime for a crossing across @xmath90 from a point @xmath91 .",
    "`` 12 '' and `` 21 '' represent statistics when crossings are restricted within @xmath92 as explained in figure  [ fig : t_regions1 ] . representing the corresponding average `` persistent time '' scales by @xmath93 ( i , j=1,2 ) , we find that due to reasons of reflection symmetry in the time correlators ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are identical , as are @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "comparing with the notations used previously , @xmath100 may be identified with @xmath101 while @xmath102 may be identified with @xmath81 under the constraint @xmath89 .",
    "for the same reason ( reflection symmetry ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : tb_stat_comp ] , the respective density distributions too conform to these symmetry lines .",

    "the number of @xmath98 events become less frequent as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "the @xmath96 densities also change slightly , again showing an increase in the probability for longer time persistence .",
    "the analysis presented here has two major immunological implications .",
    "firstly , figures [ fig : tplus_vs_delta ] and [ fig : tb_vs_delta ] clearly prove that the onset of patterning at the immature kinapse level , when the central lfa-1:icam-1 bond gives way to the smaller tcr : pmhc bond , occurs at the time scale of seconds .",
    "this discovery is expected to confirm the start time of mature synapse formation .",
    "admittedly , though , the parameter values used make the result a subjective case in that the time scale predicted for a different membrane : membrane dynamics may as well be in minutes or hours , instead of in seconds .",
    "our calculation pins down the time scale to within 2 - 4 seconds that is a further improvement on the @xmath10312 seconds window as suggested in @xcite .",
    "secondly , the non - universal character of the time correlation of the is bond as evident in the dependence on the separation length ( @xmath3 ) and separation times ( @xmath63 ) , ensuring that the probability density @xmath104 is a function of the system parameters along with being functions of @xmath3 ( figure [ fig : tb_vs_delta ] ) and @xmath98 ( figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) , confirms a widely acknowledged belief in the community that the tcr : pmhc bond is non - self - organizing in nature and hence is the only stable bond at this spatio - temporal regime .",
    "an immediate impact of this can be seen in the projected time scale for the crossover from the linear to the nonlinear phase that , as is shown in fig [ fig : tb_vs_delta ] , spans 2 - 4 seconds ( peak time of the pdf profile ) .",
    "the implication of this analysis is that of a time scale difference of an order of magnitude related to the start time of the `` immature '' is bond formation , a time scale that is also associated with the transition from the linear to the nonlinear regime ( and hence our emphasis on a study of the linear stability regime of an otherwise nonlinear dynamics ) . as to how such crossover is affected by kinase - phosphatase pathways ( these pathways act as signal transduction inhibitors and thereby control the rate of the is bond formation ) and what modification this may bring about in the prediction of the time scale of a mature is bond are some of the exciting topics that we are presently working on .",
    "new results are shortly to be communicated on the quantitative nature of the extremal value statistics of these fluctuations and how such non - universal exponents affect the life time and strength of is bonds .",
