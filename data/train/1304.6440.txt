    "it was conjectured by ivrii that the non - periodicity condition holds for all euclidean billiards .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the proofs of this conjecture in some special cases and further discussion .    the remainder @xmath6 is known to depend on dynamical properties of the billiard flow . in the present paper we focus on lower bounds for @xmath6 . for manifolds without boundary ,",
    "related results were obtained in @xcite .",
    "let us also mention the celebrated hardy  landau lower bound for the error term in the gauss s circle problem .",
    "it can be viewed as a lower bound on the weyl remainder for a flat square torus , as well as for a square with either neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it is well known that the growth of the error term is closely related to the singularities of the wave trace @xmath13 when understood as a distribution .",
    "the wave trace has a `` big '' singularity at @xmath14 , and other singularities at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the length spectrum of @xmath3 , i.e. the set of lengths of closed billiard trajectories . in any dimension",
    ", the singularity at zero produces the two main terms in weyl s law . in two dimensions ,",
    "the influence of the singularity at zero on the error term @xmath6 in the two - term asymptotics is insignificant , and therefore in order to estimate the remainder from below one has to study the contribution of the periodic orbits .",
    "this makes the two - dimensional case the most interesting and difficult .      throughout the paper we use two different representations of the billiard flow . on one hand",
    ", we view it as a map on @xmath12 , the unit cotangent bundle of @xmath3 . on the other hand , we consider the _ billiard ball map _ @xmath17 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) on @xmath18 , the co - ball bundle of the boundary .",

    "remark [ remark : maslov ] ) . condition ( i )",
    "could be probably made less restrictive , but in the present form it is sufficient to make sure that the contribution of @xmath60 is not cancelled out .",
    "condition ( ii ) is standard ( see @xcite ) ; it is necessary in order to apply the stationary phase argument .    condition ( iii ) means that the invariant circle @xmath60 stays away from the glancing set .",
    "this is needed to construct a microlocal parametrix of the dirichlet wave operator ( see section  [ multilink ] ) .",
    "it also ensures that the billiard ball map @xmath17 is smooth on @xmath60 .",
    "note that for nonconvex domains , the billiard ball map @xmath17 has discontinuities due to the existence of trajectories touching the boundary from inside ( see @xcite ) .",

    "then the weyl remainder for either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions satisfies @xmath67    the existence of a family of periodic billiard trajectories of the same length is not a generic assumption ( see @xcite ) . at the same time , it is satisfied for a number of interesting examples , including ellipses and smooth domains of constant width .",
    "there are many other billiards with one - parameter families of closed trajectories ( see @xcite and references therein ) for which theorem [ mainthm ] would hold provided the admissibility conditions ( particularly , isolation in the length spectrum ) are satisfied .    on any smooth strictly convex billiard ,",
    "there exist caustics , corresponding to the invariant circles of the billiard ball map ( see @xcite for some related spectral results ) .",
    "however , these invariant circles typically have irrational rotation numbers and do not give rise to a family of periodic orbits .",
    "it is not clear whether they are relevant for the study of the weyl remainder .",
    "[ nostadium ] note that partially rectangular domains ( including the bunimovich stadium , for which was originally conjectured by sarnak ) are not covered by theorem [ mainthm ] .",
    "the difficulties arising in their study are twofold .",
    "first , note that the fixed point set corresponding to the bouncing ball trajectories is not a submanifold of @xmath68 ; it has a boundary corresponding to the endpoints of the flats , and therefore the standard clean intersection calculus does not work .",
    "second , most partially rectangular domains are not smooth .",
    "for example , the boundary of the bunimovich stadium is @xmath69 at the points where the circular arcs meet the flat parts .",
    "despite the fact that these singularities are rather mild , the wave equation approach seems hard to implement .",
    "this is due to diffraction of singularities associated with incident waves hitting corner points and the fact that the bouncing - ball flats @xmath60 pass through the corners at the interface between the rectangular part and the semicircular wings .",
    "consequently , instead of attempting to show that the conormal expansions for @xmath70 at @xmath71 are still valid , the stationary balian - bloch approach for the dirichlet ( or neumann ) resolvent @xmath72 could be used to derive these expansions . this program will be implemented in the subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "[ noweyl ] it is not assumed in theorem [ mainthm ] ( and in theorem [ higher ] below ) that the weyl remainder satisfies the upper bound ( we note that @xmath73 does not automatically imply because the latter is an estimate on average ) .",
    "the nonperiodicity condition is known to be true for convex analytic domains @xcite , and hence holds for ellipses and analytic domains of constant width ( existence of such domains has been shown in @xcite ) .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath3 is a euclidean domain of dimension three or higher . in this case ,",
    "a lower bound on the error term could be proved using the contribution of the singularity at zero of the wave trace .",
    "in particular , we have the following    [ higher ] let @xmath74 , @xmath75 be a euclidean domain with smooth boundary .",
    "suppose that the total mean curvature of the boundary @xmath76 .",
    "then the weyl remainder for either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions satisfies @xmath77    theorem [ higher ] is a corollary of the more general proposition [ riesz ] proved in section [ higher : sec ] .",
    "note that , unlike the assumptions of theorem [ mainthm ] , the condition @xmath76 is satisfied generically .",
    "in particular , it holds for any convex domain @xmath3 .",
    "the lower bound could be generalized to riemannian manifolds with boundaries , see proposition [ riesz ] .",
    "it can be also extended to some euclidean domains with nonsmooth boundaries .",
    "for instance , it holds for generic polyhedra , including all convex ones ( see remark [ fed ] ) .",
    "estimates on the remainder in the lattice - counting problem in higher - dimensional bodies @xcite show that in dimensions @xmath78 , the bound is sharp and is saturated for rectangular parallelepipeds .",

    ", one could show : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the dimension of an admissible compact submanifold of @xmath18 corresponding to the periodic billiard trajectories of the same length ( note that in one has @xmath81 ) . according to the nonperiodicity conjecture , @xmath82 , and hence @xmath83 .",
    "if this inequality is strict , estimate does not give anything new compared to .",
    "for instance , the bouncing ball orbits in a rectangular parallelepiped form a fixed point set of dimension @xmath84 , and therefore coincides with if @xmath85 and is weaker for @xmath86 .",

    "one can check that an ellipse satisfies these assumptions , see section [ ellipse ] .",
    "the fact that the orbits belonging to @xmath60 are not orthogonal to the boundary @xmath94 significantly simplifies the analysis ( see subsection [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the proof has two main ingredients .",
    "the first is the _ rellich identity _ ( [ rellich ] ) for dirichlet eigenvalues which gives an explicit formula for the trace @xmath95 with @xmath96 as a weighted boundary trace of the normal derivatives of the dirichlet eigenfunctions . here and further on",
    ", @xmath97 denotes the schwartz space of rapidly decaying functions .",
    "the second ingredient is a conormal expansion for the boundary trace of the wave operator at microlocally clean fixed point sets of the billiard flow @xmath98 , with period @xmath71 , due to hezari and zelditch @xcite .",
    "let @xmath99 be the unit outward - pointing boundary normal at @xmath100 we define the usual normalized dirichlet eigenfunction boundary traces to be @xmath101 the rellich identity for dirichlet eigenvalues @xcite says that @xmath102 .",
    "when written in terms of the normalized boundary traces in ( [ bdytraces ] ) , this becomes @xmath103 the simple identity in ( [ rellich ] ) yields the following suggestive formula for the spectral counting function , @xmath104    without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath3 is strictly star - shaped with respect to the origin @xmath105",
    ". then the weight function @xmath106 for any @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "similarily , ( [ rellich ] ) also implies that for @xmath107 with @xmath108 @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath111 in @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the _ weighted _ boundary trace operator with schwartz kernel @xmath114 and @xmath115    it is important to note that while the lhs of ( [ key ] ) is the usual interior trace , the rhs involves only a weighted boundary trace , _ not _ the more complicated interior counterpart .",
    "indeed , as is well known , the dirichlet half wave operator @xmath116 is quite complicated even for small times .",
    "thus , instead of attempting to adapt the wave - trace methods in the boundaryless case directly to manifolds with boundary , we use the rellich formula ( [ rellich ] ) to reduce the asymptotic analysis of @xmath117 and the corresponding remainder @xmath6 entirely to the boundary , @xmath28 . in view of ( [ key ] ) and under the assumption ( [ simplify ] ) , we apply conormal expansions for @xmath118 to get lower bounds for @xmath119 indeed , with @xmath120 as above and under the assumption ( [ simplify ] ) , it is proved in ( * ? ? ? * lemma 7 ) that @xmath121 here , @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 strictly speaking , the weight function @xmath125 is not present in @xcite and the analysis is for the sine kernel @xmath126 but the expansion in ( [ conormal ] ) follows in exactly the same way . since the weight function @xmath127 for any @xmath36 , and",
    "so it follows that @xmath128 for any @xmath100 substitution of the expansion ( [ conormal ] ) into ( [ key ] ) gives @xmath129 moreover , since @xmath130 for all @xmath36 in ( [ conormal ] ) , it follows that @xmath131 and consequently , @xmath132 in ( [ upshot1 ] ) .",
    "the last step is , modulo some technical modifications , similar to the analysis in the boundaryless case .",
    "namely , using ( [ 2term ] ) and the support properties of @xmath133 we show that @xmath134 thus , for a smooth strictly star - shaped domain @xmath3 satisfying ( [ simplify ] ) it then follows from ( [ upshot2 ] ) and ( [ upshot1 ] ) that @xmath135 integration by parts and an application of sarnak s calculus lemma ( see section [ sarnak ] ) completes the proof .      as we mentioned in the previous subsection , once isolation and cleanliness are established ( see subsection [ ellipse ] ) , the above argument can be applied without changes if @xmath3 is an ellipse .",
    "however , in some other examples , such as domains of constant width , the assumption is certainly _ not _ satisfied .",
    "in fact , in the latter case the _ entire _ fixed point set of bouncing - ball geodesics is co - normal to the boundary ; that is , @xmath136 consequently , the proof in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 7 ) of the conormal expansion in ( [ conormal ] ) does not apply directly , since the boundary restriction operator @xmath137 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2 ) ) is not a homogeneous fourier integral operator ( fio ) in the sense of hrmander microlocally near @xmath138 . to compensate ,",
    "we prove a semiclassical variant of ( [ conormal ] ) using the calculus of compactly - supported semiclassical fourier integral operators @xcite .",
    "we note that variants of the rellich identity in ( [ rellich ] ) have appeared in several articles related to other eigenfunction phenomena such as  quantum ergodic restriction \" @xcite , @xmath2 restriction bounds for the dirichlet boundary traces @xcite , completeness of boundary traces @xcite , and control estimates for eigenfunctions @xcite . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", one could alternatively avoid use of the rellich identity and instead apply the possion summation formula of guillemin - melrose @xcite for the interior wave trace at non - trivial periods @xmath139 however , we find the approach via the rellich identity for the boundary traces very convenient and follow it throughout the paper .",

    "the validity of the assumption ( i ) follows from the lemma below , which completes the proof of proposition [ cwidth ] .",
    "let @xmath3 be a domain of constant width @xmath600 .",
    "then the bouncing ball orbits are the only shortest periodic orbits in @xmath3 .",

    "now , suppose there exists a sequence of periodic orbits @xmath626 such that @xmath627 as @xmath628 .",

    "this implies that @xmath641 and @xmath642 , since the only periodic orbits that may converge to a bouncing ball orbit are the bouncing ball orbits .",

    "therefore , the periodic billiard trajectories are the same as for the circular billiard . for any @xmath644 , consider the fixed point set of the iterated billiard ball map @xmath49 given by the regular @xmath572-gons inscribed in all possible two - dimensional sections of the ball .",
    "the dimension of this fixed - point set is equal to @xmath645 @xcite .",
    "indeed , for each @xmath646-plane we get a one - dimensional family of such trajectories , and the dimension of the corresponding stiefel manifold @xmath647 is equal to @xmath645 .",
    "this fixed point set is a critical manifold of the corresponding length function , which is nondegenerate in the sense of bott ( * ? ? ?",
