    "there is significant observational evidence supporting the idea that we live in a spatially - flat universe that is currently undergoing accelerated cosmological expansion .",
    "most cosmologists believe that this accelerated expansion is powered by dark energy which dominates the current cosmological energy budget .    the energy budget of the `` standard '' model of cosmology  the spatially - flat @xmath0cdm model @xcite",
    " is currently dominated by far by dark energy : einstein s cosmological constant @xmath0 contributes more than 70 % of the budget .",
    "nonrelativistic cold dark matter ( cdm ) is the next largest contributor ( more than 20 % ) , followed by nonrelativistic baryons ( around 5 % ) . for a review of the standard model see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it has been know for some time that the @xmath0cdm model is reasonably consistent with most observational constraints ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for early indications )",
    ".    however , the @xmath0cdm model appears to leave some conceptual questions unanswered .",
    "one of these is that the naive energy density scale we expect from quantum field theory considerations is many orders of magnitude higher than the measured cosmological constant energy density scale .",
    "another is what is known as the coincidence puzzle : the energy density of a cosmological constant does not change over time but the matter density decreases with the cosmological expansion , so it is puzzle why we observers live at this seemingly special time , when the dark energy and nonrelativistic matter densities happen to be of comparable size .",
    "these puzzles , and perhaps others , could be alleviated if we assume that the dark energy density was higher in the past and slowly decreased in time , thus remaining comparable to the nonrelativistic matter density for a longer time .",
    "many such time - varying dark energy models have been proposed . in this paper , for illustrative purposes , we consider two dark energy models and one dark energy parametrization .    in the @xmath0cdm model , time - independent dark energy  the cosmological constant  may be modeled as a spatially homogeneous fluid with equation of state parameter @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fluid pressure and energy density ) .    in an attempt to describe slowly decreasing dark energy , the dark energy fluid equation of state",
    "is extended to the xcdm @xmath4-fluid parametrization . here",
    ", dark energy is again modeled as a spatially homogeneous ( @xmath4 ) fluid , but now with an equation of state parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pressure and energy density of the @xmath4-fluid .",
    "when @xmath9 the xcdm parametrization reduces to the complete and consistent @xmath0cdm model . for any other value of @xmath6 ,",
    "the xcdm parametrization is incomplete as it can not describe spatial inhomogeneities ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for computational simplicity , here we study the xcdm parametrization in only the spatially - flat cosmological case .    a slowly rolling scalar field @xmath10 , with decreasing ( in @xmath10 ) potential energy density @xmath11 ,",
    "can be used to consistently model a gradually decreasing , time - evolving , dark energy density .",
    "an inverse power - law potential energy density @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a non - negative constant , provides a simple realization of this @xmath10cdm scenario .",
    "when @xmath14 the @xmath10cdm model reduces to the corresponding @xmath0cdm case . for computational simplicity , here we study the @xmath10cdm model in only the spatially - flat cosmological case .",
    "current observational data convincingly indicate that the cosmological expansion is accelerating .",
    "the main support for accelerated expansion comes from three types of data : supernova type ia ( snia ) apparent magnitude versus redshift measurements ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) combined with low estimates of the cosmological matter density ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak length scale estimates . however , the error bars associated with these three kinds of data are still too large to allow for a significant observational discrimination between the @xmath0cdm model and the two simple time - varying dark energy models discussed above .",
    "there are two major reasons to consider additional data sets .",
    "first , it is of great interest to check the above results by comparing to results derived from other data .",
    "if the new constraints differ significantly from the old ones , this could mean that the model being tested is observationally inconsistent , or it could mean that one of the data sets had an undetected systematic error .",
    "either of these is a significant result . on the other hand ,",
    "if the constraints from the new and the old data are consistent , then a joint analysis of all the data could result in significantly tighter constraints , and so possibly result in significantly discriminating between constant and time - varying dark energy .",
    "other data that have recently been used to constrain dark energy models include strong gravitational lensing measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , angular size as a function of redshift observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hubble parameter as a function of redshift measurements , galaxy cluster gas mass fraction data , and large - scale structure observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while constraints from these data are less restrictive than those derived from the sneia , cmb and bao data , both types of data result in largely compatible parameter restrictions that generally support a currently accelerating cosmological expansion .",
    "this gives us confidence that the broad outlines of the `` standard '' cosmological model are now in place .",
    "however , there is still ambiguity .",
    "current observations are unable to differentiate between different dark energy models . for instance , while current data favor a time - independent cosmological constant , they are unable to rule out time - varying dark energy .",
    "more and higher - quality data is needed to accomplish this important task .",
    "it is anticipated that future space missions will result in significantly more and better sneia , bao , and cmb anisotropy data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a complementary approach is to develop cosmological tests that make use of different sets of objects .",
    "recent examples include the lookback time test ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the gamma - ray burst luminosity versus redshft test ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gamma - ray bursts , in particular , are very luminous and can be seen to much higher redshift than the sneia and so probe an earlier cosmological epoch .",
    "h ii starburst galaxies are also very luminous and can be seen to redshifts exceeding 3 .",
    "recent work has indicated that h ii starbusrt galaxies might be standardizable candles @xcite , because of the correlation between their velocity dispersion , @xmath15 luminosity , and metallicity @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use h ii galaxy data from @xcite to constrain parameters of the three dark energy models mentioned above . @xcite",
    "have used the @xcite data to constrain the xcdm parametrization . here",
    "we also constrain parameters of the consistent and physically motivated @xmath0cdm and @xmath10cdm cosmological models .",
    "we also derive constraints on the parameters of these models and the xcdm parametrization from a joint analysis of the @xcite h ii galaxy data and the @xcite bao peak length scale measurements .    in the next section we list the basic equations for the dark energy models we consider . in sec .",
    "[ hiic ] we discuss the analysis method used for the h ii galaxy data and the resulting constraints and how they compare with those from other cosmological tests . section [ joint ] presents constraints from a joint analysis of h ii and bao data . section [ conc ] summarizes our results .",

    "our results generally agree with @xcite for the xcdm parametrization ( compare our and their fig .",
    "the small differences are due to the fact that in our analysis we do not use specially weighted sigmas , but rather average distance moduli uncertainties , and also ignore gravitational lensing effects .",

    "we again note that we have not accounted for the uncertainty in @xmath17 in our analysis , so the h ii galaxy constraints derived here are a little more restrictive than they really are .",
