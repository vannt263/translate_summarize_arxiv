    "the rte@xmath0 family of compounds ( r = rare earth ) have recently attracted renewed interest as a model system for layered ( two - dimensional ) charge - density - wave ( cdw ) materials .",
    "rte@xmath0 crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure , composed of double layers of planar te- sheets separated by corrugated r - te layers .",
    "the average chemical structure can be described using the @xmath3 space group  @xcite ( in this setting the lattice parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are close to each other , whereas @xmath6 is approximately 6 times longer ) , although in these materials an incommensurate lattice modulation with a wave vector @xmath7 is observed below the phase transition into the cdw state  @xcite .",
    "such a cdw state with modulations along the @xmath5-axis is present in all rte@xmath0 materials .",
    "however , the members with the heaviest rare - earth elements exhibit a second cdw phase transition at lower temperatures that is characterized by a modulation wavevector @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the temperatures of these two cdw transitions show opposite trends as a function of the r - atom mass .",
    "whereas @xmath9 decreases towards heavier members of the family ( _ i.e. _ , going from la to tm ) , the @xmath10 associated with the @xmath4- axis incommensurability is higher for heavier compounds  @xcite . for the specific compound studied in this report , tbte@xmath0 ,",
    "transport and diffraction experiments yield @xmath9 = 336 k. although transport measurements do not clearly reveal the presence of a second cdw transition , stm measurements performed at 6 k do show an ordering pattern that is associated with the wavevector @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "more recent high resolution x - ray diffraction measurements confirm the presence of a transverse cdw at low temperatures , with wave - vector @xmath12 , though @xmath10 is at present unknown  @xcite .",
    "the rte@xmath0 family appears to be a classic cdw system , for which the cdw wavevector corresponds to an enhancement of the generalized susceptibility @xmath13 , which is largely driven by fs nesting  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is , however , far from being a divergence , suggesting an important role for strong electron - phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface is composed of states associated with the double te layers , and is therefore similar for all members of the series .",
    "the principal role of the rare earth ion r appears to be chemical pressure , which only modestly affects the resulting cdw wavevectors  @xcite .",
    "in addition to hosting an incommensurate cdw , for magnetic rare earth ions , rte3 also hosts long range antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures .",
    "the magnetic phase transitions of rte@xmath0 have been studied using magnetisation  @xcite , calorimetry  @xcite and electrical resistivity  @xcite . using these macroscopic techniques the temperatures of the magnetic transitions",
    "have been determined and a phase diagram summarizing the temperatures of cdw and magnetic phase transition of rte@xmath0 has been established in ref .",
    "however , the nature of the long - range magnetic order in this family of compounds has not yet been studied by diffraction techniques , and the effect of the incommensurate lattice modulation on the magnetic structure is unknown . to bridge this gap",
    "we have performed neutron scattering experiments in the representative compound tbte@xmath0 .",
    "the choice of this material was dictated by the following reasons . in order to establish possible relationship of the propagation vectors",
    "associated to the cdw state and of the long - range magnetic order one needs to study the material that has reasonably close values between @xmath10 and @xmath14 . based on this condition ,",
    "the dyte@xmath0 and tbte@xmath0 are both attractive candidates according to their phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "dyte@xmath0 undergoes two magnetic phase transitions at t@xmath153.6  k and t@xmath153.45  k  @xcite .",
    "however , due to high absorption of dy the neutron measurements on dyte@xmath0 are too challenging  @xcite .",
    "tbte@xmath0 exhibits three closely located magnetic phase transitions at the following temperatures : @xmath1 = 5.78  k , @xmath16 = 5.56  k and @xmath17 = 5.38  k  @xcite . here",
    ", we present a study of the magnetic phase transitions in tbte@xmath0 using powder and single crystal neutron diffraction .",
    "single crystals of tbte@xmath0 were grown by slow cooling a binary melt , as described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "as the material is rather air - sensitive , the tbte@xmath0 powder was obtained by crushing the single crystals in he - atmosphere .",
    "the powder was immediately sealed in a cylindric vanadium can of 6  mm in diameter used for the measurements .",
    "powder neutron diffraction experiments were performed at the dmc cold - neutron diffractometer  @xcite(neutron spallation source sinq  @xcite , psi ) in the temperature range 1.5  60  k. most of the data were collected with neutron wavelengths of @xmath18   , giving access to the wave vectors range 0.13.4  @xmath19 .",
    "typical exposure times were @xmath20 hours .",
    "the experiments on the single crystals of tbte@xmath0 with size of roughly @xmath21 mm@xmath22 were performed at the trics single crystal diffractometer  @xcite .",
    "a pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) monochromator was used with neutron wavelength @xmath23  .",
    "a 120 mm long pg filter was installed in the beam in order to ensure full suppression of higher - order neutrons .",
    "the temperature range of interest for these measurements is @xmath24  k , because the three magnetic phase transitions are close to each other in the range @xmath25  k. this interval was scanned with steps of @xmath26  k. to ensure the required accuracy in temperature an `` orange''-type he flow cryostat was used .",
    "one of the samples was aligned in the [ h , k,0 ] plane and a second sample was aligned in the [ 0,k , l ] .",
    "the normal beam geometry was employed , tilting the detector in the range of -10 ... 10 deg .",
    "this allowed to access reflections with l=@xmath271 and h=@xmath271 , respectively .",

    "note that the bragg peaks that are labeled for simplicity as ( @xmath32 ) , in fact have a non - zero component of modulation along the ( @xmath33 ) direction and more precisely should be described as ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "nevertheless , the lattice parameters obtained from the data @xmath35  , @xmath36  , and @xmath37   are in agreement with those published earlier  @xcite . in what follows we concentrate on the differences of the data taken at temperatures lower than 60  k. in this experimental setup the low - temperature changes in the chemical structure of tbte@xmath0",
    "are not resolved .",
    "figure  [ differences ] shows difference - patterns at selected temperatures , obtained by eliminating the contribution from the chemical structure with the subtraction of the diffraction pattern at 60 k. as expected from the macroscopic properties of tbte@xmath0 , magnetic bragg peaks appear in the diffraction patterns collected below @xmath1= 5.78  k. furthermore , relatively sharp asymmetric peaks appear in the diffraction patterns even at temperatures slightly higher then @xmath1 ( e.g. , the patterns taken at 6.2  k and 7  k ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ differences ] , these unusual peaks have an extended shoulder towards higher wavevectors .",
    "such scattering profiles from powders are typical for systems with pronounced quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) properties , as observed _ e.g. _ in graphite  @xcite or in 2d magnetic materials  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may expect that in a relatively broad temperature range above @xmath1 tbte@xmath0 exhibits quasi-2d behavior .",
    "the positions of the magnetic bragg peaks are temperature - dependent and may be clearly distinct in different magnetic phases .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic phases occurring in tbte@xmath0 are modulated and the propagation vector is locked - in at incommensurate position only below @xmath17 . in addition , the asymmetric peaks above @xmath1 are located at a different wavevector as compared to magnetic bragg peaks observed just below @xmath1 .",

    "clearly , most of the magnetic bragg peaks are at positions incommensurate with the average chemical structure of the material .",
    "it may be speculated that the broad magnetic peaks observed in the vicinity of @xmath39   and @xmath40   are composed by many magnetic bragg peaks which are located close to each other in wave - vector space , due to the rather large value of the lattice parameter @xmath6 .",
