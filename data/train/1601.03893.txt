    "a magnetic skyrmion is a nanometric magnetic domain wall structure of which the spin configuration is swirling in the planar space and would wrap a unit three - dimensional spherical surface with spins pointing in all directions in the compactification of the planar space  @xcite .",
    "recently , experiments have revealed the existence of both nel - type and bloch - type skyrmions in thin films as well as bulk materials  @xcite .",
    "the spin configuration of a skyrmion is topologically protected , which is stable as long as it does not overlap tilted spins on the sample edge or shrink to the lattice scale .",
    "another merit of a skyrmion is that it can be displaced by a spin - polarized current in confined structures .",
    "thus , the skyrmion is expected to be a key component of future device applications in the emerging field of skyrmionics  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the creation , manipulation , and elimination of skyrmions in confined geometries using cutting - edge technologies  @xcite . however , one significant obstacle to the essential transmission process of skyrmions in devices is the skyrmion hall effect ( skhe )  @xcite , where a skyrmion gains a transverse motion perpendicular to the imposed driving direction . as a consequence",
    ", the skyrmion , which carries encoded information , might be destructed when it passes a narrow racetrack - type channel  @xcite and/or when it travels at a high speed , by touching the edge of the device  @xcite .",
    "recently we have shown in ref .   that a bilayer - skyrmion moves perfectly straight in the direction of the driving current in a bilayer synthetic antiferromagnetic ( saf ) racetrack , where the skhe is completely suppressed .",
    "the two skyrmions in the top and bottom ferromagnetic ( fm ) layers of the bilayer saf racetrack have the opposite skyrmion numbers , and thus the potential transverse shift directions are opposite and canceled  @xcite .",
    "we note that the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) skyrmions in monolayer  @xcite and bilayer  @xcite afm racetracks are also free from the skhe , where the afm skyrmions have the skyrmion number of zero .",
    "another challenging problem is about the effect of thermal fluctuations , which is detrimental to the skyrmion - based device applications .",
    "a skyrmion is largely deformed and might be easily destroyed by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "hence , the thermal effect is one of the important factors to realize the skyrmion - based device applications  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the thermal fluctuation effect on the motion of skyrmions in multilayer saf racetracks as well as in monolayer fm racetracks based on numerical simulations and a multilayer thiele equation .",
    "the skyrmions in all fm layers of a multilayer saf racetrack are bound to one single saf multilayer skyrmion by the interlayer afm exchange coupling .",
    "we call it a saf @xmath2-layer skyrmion , where @xmath2 stands for the number of constituent fm layers .",
    "first , we investigate the current - driven dynamics of a saf @xmath2-layer skyrmion at zero temperature ( @xmath3 k ) .",
    "we find the odd - even effect of the number @xmath2 of constituent fm layers on the skhe , which is understood as the total skyrmion number of the skyrmions in each individual fm layer .",
    "namely , the saf @xmath2-layer skyrmion shows the skhe only when @xmath2 is odd .",
    "furthermore , we find that the velocity of the saf @xmath2-layer skyrmion at a given driving current density is inversely proportional to @xmath2 when the driving current is applied only in the bottom fm layer",
    ". we also point out that when the driving current is applied in all fm layers , the velocity of the saf @xmath2-layer skyrmion is basically equal to that of the fm monolayer skyrmion at a given driving current density .",
    "second , we investigate the current - driven dynamics of a saf @xmath2-layer skyrmion at finite temperature ( @xmath4 k ) .",
    "it is shown that the fm monolayer skyrmion with typical material parameters is destroyed when @xmath1 k. on the other hand , the saf bilayer skyrmion is stable and goes straight along the bilayer saf racetrack even at room temperature ( @xmath0 k ) .",
    "this is because that the two skyrmions consisting the saf bilayer skyrmion are tightly bound by the interlayer afm exchange coupling , where the skhes acting on the two skyrmions are opposite and canceled out . in general , for the system with a relatively large damping coefficient , the thermal fluctuation effect decreases rapidly as the layer number @xmath2 increases at a certain temperature .",
    "our results provide a promising route to realizing the skyrmion - based device applications at room temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the monolayer fm racetrack as well as the multilayer saf racetracks studied in this paper .",
    "the monolayer fm racetrack contains one fm layer and a heavy - metal substrate underneath the fm layer .",
    "the @xmath2-layer saf racetrack ( @xmath5 ) includes @xmath2 fm layers , which are separated by @xmath6 nonmagnetic spacer layers .",
    "the fm layers are denoted from bottom to top as l1 , l2 , l3 , @xmath7 . in all models ,",
    "the length along the @xmath8-axis , width along the @xmath9-axis , and thickness along the @xmath10-axis of each fm layer and nonmagnetic spacer are respectively equal to @xmath11 nm , @xmath12 nm , and @xmath13 nm , where the fm layer l1 is attached to the heavy - metal substrate .    in the @xmath2-layer saf racetracks ( @xmath5 ) , the neighboring fm layers are antiferromagnetically exchange - coupled through their fm / spacer / fm interfaces .",
    "the magnetization in each fm layer is perpendicular to the racetrack plane due to the high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) , while the magnetization in neighboring fm layers are antiparallel due to the interlayer afm exchange coupling .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) in fm layers lead to the tilt of magnetization near the edges of the fm layers .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dmi in fm layers can be induced by both the heavy - metal substrate and spacer layers in real experiments  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies have suggested and developed the methods to induce the dmi in multilayers .",
    "more promisingly , it has been recently shown that by constructing the spacer layer made of two different heavy - metal materials , additive dmi can be achieved in multilayers  @xcite .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we explicitly consider the saf @xmath2-layer skyrmions with @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the relaxed magnetization distributions of the fm layers l1 and l3 are almost pointing along the @xmath15-direction , while those of the fm layers l2 and l4 are almost pointing along the @xmath16-direction .",
    "the background magnetization directions determine the skyrmion number of the skyrmion in each fm layer .",
    "the skyrmion number equals @xmath13 in the fm layers l1 and l3 , while it equals @xmath17 in the fm layers l2 and l4 .",
    "the total skyrmion number @xmath18 of the saf @xmath2-layer skyrmion is @xmath2 modulo @xmath19 .",
    "namely , @xmath20 for @xmath14 , respectively ( see sec .  [ se : skhe ] for details ) .",
    "at the initial state , the skyrmions are first created and relaxed at the position of @xmath21 nm , @xmath22 nm . with regard to the injection scheme of the driving current , we consider a confined current - perpendicular - to - plane ( cpp ) geometry .",
    "namely , an electron current flows through the heavy - metal substrate in the @xmath23-direction , which is converted into a spin current polarized along the @xmath24-direction and is perpendicularly injected into the fm layer l1 , due to the spin hall effect ( see ref .   for a recent experimental example ) .",
    "the skyrmion in the fm layer l1 is driven by the vertical spin current , while the other skyrmions in the fm layers l2 , l3 , and l4 move accordingly due to the interlayer afm exchange coupling between each adjacent fm layers .",
    "it should be noted that , for comparison purpose , we also simulate the straightforward case of unconfined cpp geometry with the bilayer saf racetrack , where the spin current is injected into all fm layers , neglecting the spin current absorption in the model .",
    "we investigate the multilayer saf racetrack comprised of @xmath2 fm layers , where the neighboring fm layers are antiferromagnetically exchange - coupled by the interlayer afm exchange interaction , as illustrated in fig .",

    "we have found that a moving saf bilayer skyrmion is much more stable than a moving fm monolayer skyrmion , even when the temperature effect is taken into account , since the two skyrmions consisting the saf bilayer skyrmion are tightly bound by the interlayer afm exchange coupling , and thus the saf bilayer skyrmion is immune from the skhe . besides",
    ", we have shown that the detrimental effect of the skhe on the moving fm monolayer skyrmion is enhanced as temperature increases , while the saf bilayer skyrmion can safely move along the racetrack even at room temperature .",
    "in addition , the odd - even effect of the constituent fm layer number on the skhe in multilayer saf racetracks has also been demonstrated . due to the suppression of the skhe ,",
    "the skyrmions have no transverse motion in multilayer saf racetracks with even constituent fm layers . in conclusion , we find that the bilayer saf racetrack is a preferred host for skyrmion transmission in racetrack - type device applications since it realizes a minimum system which does not show the skhe .",
