    "physical systems , in which double - diffusion induced convection plays an essential role , are often found in nature .",
    "there are two components with significantly different diffusion coefficients in such systems",
    ". it can be heat and salt in the sea water , heat and helium in stellar atmospheres , or two reagents in chemical reactors . as a result of various spatial distribution of these components in a gravitational field arises convection , which can have various forms and lead to a variety of phenomena  @xcite .",

    "it is understandable that the results of double - diffusive convection , for example , in the ocean , can be applied to double - diffusive convection in astrophysical systems or in chemical reactor .",
    "there are a number of works devoted to various theoretical models of systems with double - diffusive convection . in 8090 years",
    "the formation of structures in the neighborhood of hopf bifurcation points for the horizontally translation - invariant systems was actively studied in some works .",
    "the development of oscillations in such systems give rise to different types of waves ( eg , standing , running , modulated , chaotic ) , which well described by a generalized ginzburg  landau equations  @xcite . the equations of this type must be derived from the basic system of partial differential equations for the given physical system by asymptotic methods .",
    "however , a full and well - grounded derivation of amplitude equations for systems with double - diffusive convection ( especially three - dimensional ) is still poorly represented in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this work is the derivation of amplitude equations for the three - dimensional double - diffusive system in the neighborhood of hopf bifurcation points for the case of roll - type convection .",
    "this extends the idea of previous work  @xcite , where a two - dimensional and three - dimensional convection in a square - cells was investigated by alike methods .",
    "consider 3d double - diffusive convection in a liquid layer of a width @xmath0 , confined by two plane horizontal boundaries .",
    "the liquid layer is heated and salted from below .",
    "the governing equations in this case are hydrodynamical equations for a liquid mixture in the gravitational field  @xcite :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the velocity field of liquid , @xmath3 is the temperature , @xmath4 is the salt concentration , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the density of liquid , @xmath7 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath8 is the kinematic viscosity of fluid , @xmath9 is the thermal diffusivity of the liquid , @xmath10 is the salt diffusivity .",

    "distributed sources of heat and salt are absent . on the upper and lower boundaries of the layer",
    "the constant values of temperature and salinity are supported , higher at the lower boundary .",
    "the governing equations are transformed into dimensionless form with the use of boussinesq approximation and following units for length , time , velocity , pressure , temperature and salinity respectively : @xmath0 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are temperature and salinity differences across the layer .",

    "consider the equations for double - diffusive convection in the vicinity of a bifurcation point , the temperature and salinity rayleigh numbers for which are designated as @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively . in this case",
    "the rayleigh numbers can be represented as follows : @xmath31 values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are of unit order , and the small parameter @xmath34 shows how far from the bifurcation point the system is . to derive the amplitude equations we use the derivative - expansion method , which is a variant of multiple - scale method  @xcite .",
