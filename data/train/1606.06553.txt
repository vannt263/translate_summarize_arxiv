    "first we show @xmath4 is absolutely continuous on lines . this part of the proof parallels pfluger s proof that a mapping satisfying the geometric definition of quasiconformality is absolutely continuous on lines .",
    "his proof can be found in @xcite and is reproduced in english in @xcite , p.  162 .",
    "we fix a rectangle @xmath316 and let @xmath317 for @xmath318 between @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "define @xmath321 to be the area in @xmath322 beneath the image of @xmath323 . since @xmath80 is an increasing function of @xmath318 , it is differentiable almost everywhere .",
    "we will show @xmath324 is absolutely continuous for all @xmath318 at which @xmath80 is differentiable ; a similar argument applies to vertical line segments .",
    "we select an arbitrary collection @xmath325 of disjoint sub - intervals of @xmath323 and consider the collection of rectangles @xmath326 where each @xmath327 has height @xmath328 and bottom side on the @xmath329th sub - interval .",
    "then we apply proposition [ prop : main1 ] to a set of non - intersecting equilateral triangles of height @xmath328 each contained in some @xmath327 .",
    "we are able to conclude    @xmath330 since we chose @xmath318 where @xmath80 is differentiable , letting @xmath328 go to @xmath53 gives @xmath331    to then conclude that @xmath4 is quasiconformal we once again use proposition [ prop : main1 ] .",
    "since @xmath4 is open and absolutely continuous on lines , @xmath4 is differentiable almost everywhere by gehring and lehto s theorem @xcite .",
    "we look at a square @xmath332 with sides parallel to the coordinate axes , side - length @xmath333 and center at a point of differentiability .",
    "let @xmath162 denote the pre - image under @xmath4 of a curve of shortest length contained in @xmath334 with end points on the images of the vertical sides of @xmath335 .",
    "we create a chain @xmath336 of non - intersecting triangles such that each @xmath337 shares at least one vertex with @xmath338 , @xmath73 has a vertex on one end point of @xmath162 , and @xmath339 has a vertex on the other end point of @xmath162 . by proposition [ prop : main1 ]",
    "we are able to conclude that @xmath340 where @xmath341 denotes the area of the image of @xmath335 and @xmath342 denotes the length of the shortest curve between the images of the vertical sides of @xmath335 which is contained in @xmath334 .",
    "we then may use this inequality to replace the use of rengel s inequality in pfluger s proof and conclude @xmath343    note that once it is known that @xmath4 is differentiable almost everywhere , the computations of corollary [ cor:1 ] also show us that @xmath4 is quasiconformal .",
    "the key point of both of our proofs given here is contained in proposition [ prop : main1 ] , where it is proved that the image of a triangle contains a disk of a definite size , exhibiting a certain length - area estimate .",
    "this approach goes back to pfluger and was pushed forward by koskela and rogovin who proved that the acl property of a homeomorphism @xmath4 between open sets of @xmath344 , @xmath345 , could be established from an @xmath346-control of @xmath347 where @xmath348 denotes the lebesgue measure of @xmath349 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "the authors would like to thank pekka koskela for mentioning this similarity .",
