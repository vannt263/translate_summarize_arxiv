    "this article is part of a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite devoted to the investigation of water - hammer problems in fluid - filled pipes , both from the experimental and theoretical perspective .",
    "water - hammer experiments are a prototype model for many situations in industrial and military applications ( e.g. , trans - ocean pipelines and communication networks ) where we have fluid - structure interaction and a consequent propagation of shock - waves . after the pioneering work of korteweg@xmath0 ( 1878 ) and joukowsky@xmath1 ( 1900 ) , who modeled water - hammer waves by neglecting inertia and bending stiffness of the pipe , a more comprehensive investigation , developed by skalak @xcite in the fifties , considered inertial effects both in the pipe and the fluid , including longitudinal and bending stresses of the pipe .",
    "skalak combined the shell theory for the tube deformation and an acoustic model of the fluid motion .",
    "he shows there is a coexistence of two waves traveling at different speeds : the precursor wave ( of small amplitude and of speed close the sound speed of the pipe wall ) and the primary wave ( of larger amplitude and lower speed ) .",
    "additionally , a simplified four - equation one - dimensional model is derived based on the assumption that pressure and axial velocity of the fluid are constant across cross - sections @xcite .",
    "later studies of tijsseling @xcite-@xcite have regarded modeling of isotropic thin pipes including an analysis of the effect of thickness on isotropic pipes based on the four - equation model @xcite . while all these papers consider the case of elastically isotropic pipes , the investigation of anisotropy in water - filled pipes of composite materials",
    "was first obtained in @xcite where stress wave propagation is investigated for a system composed of water - filled thin pipe with symmetric winding angles @xmath2 . in the same geometry , a platform of numerical computations , based on the finite element method , was developed in @xcite to describe the fluid - structure interaction during shock - wave loading of a water - filled carbon - reinforced plastic ( cfrp ) tube coupled with a solid - shell and a fluid solver .",
    "more complex situations involve systems of pipes mounted coaxially where the annular regions between the pipes can be filled with fluid . in this scenario ,",
    "brmann has considered the modeling of non - stationary flow of compressible fluids in pipelines with several flow sections @xcite .",
    "his approach consists of reducing the system of partial differential equations governing the fluid - structure interaction in coaxial pipes into a 1-dimensional problem by the method of characteristics .",
    "later works have appeared on the modeling of sound dispersion in a cylindrical viscous layer bounded by two elastic thin - walled shells @xcite and of the wave propagation in coaxial pipes filled with either fluid or a viscoelastic solid @xcite .",
    "motivated by the recent experimental effort of j. shepherd s group on the investigation of the water - hammer in annular geometries @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , we extend the modeling work of @xcite and @xcite to investigate the propagation of stress waves inside an annular geometry delimited by two water - filled coaxial pipes , in elastically isotropic and cfrp pipes .",
    "a projectile impact causes propagation of a water pressure wave causing the deformation of the pipes .",
    "positive extension in the radial direction of the outer pipe , accompanied by negative extension ( contraction ) in the radial direction of the internal pipe , causes an increase in the annular area thus activating the fluid - structure interaction mechanism .",
    "the architecture of the paper is as follows . after reviewing the work of you and",
    "inaba on the modeling of elastically anisotropic pipes , we present the six - equation one - dimensional model ( paragraph [ 1311081717 ] ) that rules the fluid - solid interaction in a two - pipe system . in section [ 1311081625 ]",
    "we compare our theoretical findings with experimental data obtained during a series of water - hammer experiments . finally , in the case of fiber",
    "reinforced pipes , the wave propagation and the computation of hoop and axial strain are described in full detail in paragraph [ 1312181514 ] .",
    "here and in what follows subscript @xmath3 is either set to be equal to 1 ( in the case in which we refer to the internal pipe ) or 2 ( external pipe ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calculated primary and precursor waves are shown in fig . [ 1305101143 ] as functions of @xmath4 .",
    "similar to the one - pipe scenario of @xcite , as @xmath4 increases the result is a reinforcement of the hoop stiffness and an increase in the primary wave speed which corresponds to the breathing mode of the pipes .",
    "conversely , the speed of the precursor waves ( corresponding to a longitudinal mode of the pipes ) diminishes due to decreased axial stiffness .",
    "we remark that the computation of the physical variables is based on the incident wave @xmath5 because its magnitude is much larger than those of precursor waves . in this case , by eq .",
    "( [ 1305091618 ] ) we have @xmath6 and therefore the graph of the fluid pressure is not reported .",
    "precursor wave speeds @xmath7 and @xmath8 are very similar when the parameter @xmath9 is very small which happens for either small or large @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ 1309302314 ] ) where for @xmath10 we have @xmath11 .",
    "it is possible to prove that this corresponds to the cases for which the coupling stiffness @xmath12 as a function of @xmath4 is minimal . on the other hand ,",
    "it follows that for intermediate values of @xmath4 wavespeed @xmath7 becomes slower while @xmath9 becomes larger and is maximized at @xmath13 when also @xmath12 is large .",
    "proof of the dependence of @xmath9 on the coupling term @xmath12 requires a more detailed asymptotic analysis and it is therefore left to a forthcoming paper .",
    "plots of the hoop and axial strain in pipes 1 and 2 calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ 1311100014 ] ) and ( [ 1309291512 ] ) are reported in fig .",
    "[ 1305101157 ] .",
    "as the impulsive impact by the projectile generates a positive water pressure , pipe 2 undergoes a positive expansion in the radial direction ( hoop strain is positive ) while pipe 1 is contracted in the radial direction ( hoop strain is negative ) . note that the radial expansion of pipe 2 accompanies the contraction in the axial direction while the radial contraction of pipe 1 accompanies the expansion in the axial direction",
    "this explains why hoop and axial strain have opposite signs .",
    "the hoop strain is essentially determined by the hoop compliance @xmath14 and therefore the absolute values of the hoop strains in both pipe 1 and 2 are large for small @xmath4 and are decreasing for increasing @xmath4 .",
    "then , at a first order of approximation , the axial strain is mainly determined by the coupling term @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) and therefore the axial strains in both pipe 1 and 2 are maximized ( in absolute value ) for @xmath15 .    ,",

    "we have investigated the propagation of stress waves in water - filled pipes in an annular geometry . a six - equation model that describes",
    "the fluid - structure interaction has been derived and adapted to both elastically isotropic and anisotropic ( fiber - reinforced ) pipes .",
    "the natural frequencies of the system ( eigenvalues ) and the amplitude of the pressure and velocity of the fluid , along with the mechanical strains and stresses in the pipes ( eigenvectors ) have been computed and compared with experimental data of water - hammer tests . it is observed that the projectile impact causes a positive expansion of the external pipe in the radial direction and a contraction in the axial direction ( poisson s effect ) .",
    "vice versa , the internal pipe is contracted in the radial direction and expanded axially . in the last section of the paper , which is a benchmark for future experimental investigation , we have analyzed in full detail the propagation of waves in cfrp pipes with a special emphasis on the influence of the winding angle on the wave speeds and the axial and hoop strains in the pipes .",
    "most interestingly , we found that the speed of the primary wave ( breathing mode ) increases with the increasing winding angle due to increasing hoop stiffness in both pipes .",
    "this is in agreement with the one - pipe model and analysis of @xcite .",
    "conversely , the profile of the speed of the precursor waves ( longitudinal modes ) is large when the winding angle is small ( and therefore the axial stiffness is large ) and it decreases with increasing winding angle .",
    "additionally , we have observed that the two precursor waves travel at almost the same speed when the fiber winding angle is equal to either @xmath18 or @xmath19 while a separation of the velocities is observed for @xmath4 in between these values , a phenomenon which is the object of further analysis .",
