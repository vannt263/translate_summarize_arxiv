    "recent studies suggest that the ionising radiation escaping from galaxies could give a substantial ( possibly dominant ) contribution to the ultraviolet background radiation ( uvb ) during a large cosmological time span ( giallongo , fontana & madau 1997 ; giroux & shull 1997 ; bianchi , cristiani & kim 2001 ) .",
    "also , at large redshifts , radiation from the first stellar objects has very likely driven the process of cosmic reionisation ( gnedin & ostriker 1998 ; ciardi 2000 ; miralda - escud , haehnelt & rees 2000 ; gnedin 2000 ; benson 2000 ; ciardi 2001 ) . in spite of this extensive body of work on both aspects , their predictive power is jeopardized by the persisting ( theoretical and experimental ) ignorance on the value of @xmath0 , the fraction of hydrogen - ionising photons that escapes from the parent galaxy into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "obviously , this quantity enters the modeling of the uvb and reionisation process and the results depend quite sensibly on the assumptions made about this poorly constrained parameter .",
    "a promising way to make theoretical progresses on this issue is to improve the degree of realism of the modeling and the treatment of physical processes to make predictions that can be directly compared with available local and intermediate redshift data .",
    "dove & shull ( 1994b ) initially tackled the problem of determining @xmath0 by assuming smoothly varying h i distributions in the galactic disk .",
    "they concluded that about 14% of lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons are able to escape the disk .",
    "dove , shull & ferrara ( 2000 ) later improved the calculation by solving the time - dependent radiation transfer problem of stellar radiation through evolving superbubbles .",
    "their main result is that the shells of the expanding superbubbles quickly trap ionising photons , so that most of the radiation escapes shortly after the formation of the superbubble .",
    "this results in a value of @xmath0 roughly a factor of 2 lower than obtained by dove & shull ( 1994b ) .",
    "additional theoretical works ( ricotti & shull 2000 ; wood & loeb 2000 ) have extended the analysis to include high - redshift galaxies , for which the escape of lyc photons can be modified by geometrical effects ( disk vs. spheroidal systems ) and by the higher mean galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) density . generally speaking ,",
    "the escape fraction decreases as the object virialization redshift or mass become larger ; for a typical 2-@xmath9 fluctuation in a cdm model at redshift @xmath10 these studies derive even lower values ( @xmath11% ) .",
    "observationally , a wide range of values for the escape fraction has been deduced , but it appears that some data favor larger values than expected from theory .",
    "for example , most of the detections of starburst galaxies with the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( leitherer 1995 ; hurwitz , jelinsky & dixon 1997 ; heckman 2001 ) are consistent with @xmath12 , although objects have been observed with @xmath13 ( hurwitz , jelinsky & dixon 1997 ) . however , absorption from undetected interstellar components could allow the true escape fractions to exceed these upper limits .",
    "bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1999 ; see erratum 2001 ) used optical line emission data for the magellanic stream to derive @xmath14% .",
    "even more puzzling are the recent results ( steidel , pettini & adelberger 2001 ; haenhelt 2001 ) who detected flux beyond the lyman limit ( with significant residual flux at @xmath15 ) in a composite spectrum of 29 lbgs at @xmath16 .",
    "also , this implies that at these early epochs galaxies were much more transparent to ionising radiation than at present time , contrary to the trend found by the theoretical works mentioned before .",
    "can the low values of @xmath0 predicted by theory and the high values suggested by recent observations be brought into agreement ? in this paper",
    "we try to ascertain if the dichotomy can be removed by considering the effects of inhomogeneities in the ism structure and a more realistic distribution of massive stars , the primary sources of ionising photons .",
    "as already pointed out before , essentially all studies ( with the partial exception of wood & loeb 2000 ) to date have derived the escape fraction assuming smoothly varying gas density distributions . however",
    ", this position is clearly untenable in the light of the large number of observations showing that the ism in the galaxy and nearby ones has a hierarchical , very likely fractal , structure ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "this view is also supported by theoretical works ( see for example norman & ferrara 1996 ) , which predict a fractal behavior over a large dynamical range .",
    "this type of organization naturally arises from turbulent pressure , which plays a crucial role in the various phases of the ism ( see for example kulkarni & fich [ 1985 ] for the cold neutral hi component and reynolds [ 1985 ] for the warm ionised medium ) : norman & ferrara ( 1996 ) showed that the ism turbulent pressure is roughly 30 times higher than the thermal one .",
    "turbulence is pumped into the ism primarily by multi - sn explosions ; however , reaching the high energy density of present day galaxies requires a considerable fraction of the hubble time at high redshift .",
    "hence the ism of these primordial systems , differently from their local counterparts , is likely to be more quiescent and smooth .",
    "for these reasons , it seems worthwhile to examine a model for the escape fraction in which a fractal , turbulence dominated ism is taken into account .",
    "this is what we explore in the rest of the paper .",
    "in this section we describe the model adopted for the milky way ( mw ) gas density and the stellar distribution , as well as the source emission properties .",
    "we use the mw as a reference template , but our results should hold with good approximation for the entire class of mw - type galaxies , as long as the properties of their ism are similar .    to study the escape of ( ionising ) lyman continuum ( lyc ) photons from the mw , we have chosen a representative cubic volume of 1  kpc@xmath17 located above the disk midplane and centered at the solar position .",
    "this allows us to exploit the high quality data available for the spatial distribution of the ionising ob stars ( garmany , conti & chiosi 1982 ) .",
    "also , the same argument applies to the exquisite detail with which the gas density distribution has been derived ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; reynolds & haffner 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "comparison between the soft x - ray background and absorption line experiments toward stars near the sun , have suggested that we live in a rarefied , hot ism cavity , usually known as the local bubble , whose average radial extent is @xmath18 100 pc ( sanders et al . 1977 ; snowden et al .",
    "1990 ; sfeir et al .",
    "as the volume of the local bubble is only 0.2% of the simulation volume , we neglect for simplicity the effects of such structure on our results .      in order to compare the effects of inhomogeneities on the escape of lyc photons with previous results",
    ", we have first considered the commonly adopted gaussian hi density distribution ( gdd ) : n_hi(z)=n_0 exp(-z^2/2h^2 ) , [ gdens ] where @xmath19 is the height above the midplane of the disk .",
    "such distribution is a solution of hydrostatic equation for the gas in the gravitational field of a disk galaxy , including a dark matter component .",
    "the gaussian distribution that most closely resembles the three - component dickey - lockman ( 1990 ) vertical distribution has parameters @xmath20  @xmath21 and @xmath22  kpc ( dove , shull & ferrara 2000 ) .",
    "this gives a total neutral hydrogen column density perpendicular to the disk of @xmath23  @xmath24 .",
    "observations of molecular clouds have shown that with increasing spatial resolution the gas distribution breaks up into substructures of yet smaller scales .",
    "the self - similarity of the relations linking some of the molecular cloud properties ( such as the mass - size relation and the distribution functions of size and mass ) suggests that the density distribution very likely has a fractal structure induced by turbulence ( falgarone , phillips & walker 1991 ; elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ; elmegreen 1999 ) . as a more realistic description ,",
    "we have thus alternatively adopted a fractal model .",
    "a fractal ism distribution is obtained from hierarchically clustered points , along the prescriptions given by elmegreen ( 1997 ) . in brief , starting from a point with coordinates @xmath25 , fractals on the @xmath26 plane were made with @xmath27 hierarchical levels by choosing continuous coordinates such that for random numbers @xmath28 in the interval [ 0,1 ] , @xmath29 at the first level , @xmath30 at the second level , and so on up to level @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is a geometric factor for subdivision of one level into the next .",
    "the same procedure was used for @xmath33 . at each level",
    ", @xmath34 new positions were substituted for each position in the previous level , leaving @xmath35 positions after @xmath31 levels . at each height @xmath19 , a @xmath36 square grid was placed around all the points , and the number of points inside each grid cell was counted .",
    "we thus recovered the gas density in each grid cell constraining its average value to be the same as for the gaussian distribution of eq .",
    "[ gdens ] .",
    "the resulting gas distribution has thus a fractal dimension @xmath37 , which is consistent with the experimentally derived value ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) .",
    "this procedure is repeated at each of the 64 heights that have discrete values in the range @xmath38  kpc ; this range represents a good compromise between the need to encompass most of the vertical extent of the hi disk and to achieve a sufficient spatial sampling .",
    "the clumping factor of this distribution , @xmath39 , calculated as a function of distance from the midplane , ranges between 4 and 8 .    in principle , it would have been possible to use the hi distribution directly obtained from 21-cm line observations . however , resolving power limitations make such maps of little use to study the effects of inhomogeneities . for example",
    ", the spatial sampling of the dwingeloo survey ( burton & hartmann 1994 ) is @xmath40 ( corresponding to @xmath41 kpc ) but the spectral sampling is 1.03 km s@xmath3 , or 0.1 kpc .",
    "this is about a factor of 6 lower than the resolution required by our simulation .",
    "surveys with higher spatial resolution ( 1 arcmin ) do exist , but they do not cover a sufficiently large latitude range ( the best is probably the canadian galactic plane survey which covers @xmath42 to @xmath43 , equivalent to half the simulation box ) at roughly the same spectral resolution .",
    "thus , we have restricted our analysis to the previous two model cases .",
    "a summary of the adopted density distributions in the various simulation runs is shown in table  1 .",
    "for illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] we show a slice of the gdd ( left panel ) and the fdd ( right panel ) cut through a plane perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "measurements of faint optical interstellar emission lines and pulsar dispersion measures , show that in the mw approximately 1/3 of the hi mass is contained in the warm ionized medium ( reynolds 1991a ; reynolds 1993 ) . to account for the presence of such component",
    ", we have multiplied the gdd and fdd described above by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "we assume that initially the gas has a temperature of 100  k , as derived for the cold neutral medium .",
    "table 1 : simulation parameters    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath44density distribution + @xmath45stellar distribution + @xmath46stellar surface density [ kpc@xmath47 +    garmany , conti & chiosi ( 1982 ) compiled a catalog of o - type stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the catalog is supposed to be complete to a distance of 2.5 kpc from the sun . within this radius ,",
    "the surface density of such component is about @xmath48 stars kpc@xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we have reproduced the local stellar population by randomly extracting positions and photon ionisation rates for 24 stars in our 1 kpc@xmath17 computational volume as follows .",
    "we have adopted for the stars a vertical gaussian distribution with a scaleheight @xmath50  pc , as recently derived by maz - apellniz ( 2001 ) from a sample of o - b5 stars from the hipparcos catalog . by randomly sampling this distribution ,",
    "we have derived the @xmath19-coordinate of each star ; the @xmath51 and @xmath52 coordinates have been selected randomly .",
    "all stars above the galactic plane have been included in the simulations .",
    "as the star formation process should preferentially take place in the densest regions of the ism , we have also produced stellar distributions assuming that the probability of finding a star in a certain region is proportional to a power of the gas density , @xmath53 , a schmidt - type law ( kennicut 1998 ) .",
    "finally , we have also produced stellar distributions with a surface density two times larger than the local one , @xmath54 kpc@xmath49 , to study the dependence of @xmath0 on a larger range of ionisation rates .",
    "a summary of the adopted stellar distributions is shown in table  1 .      a spectral type and luminosity class has been randomly assigned to each star , using the number frequencies of objects of a given type in the catalog of garmany , conti & chiosi ( 1982 ) . within 2.5 kpc from the sun ,",
    "about 50% of the stars are of o9.0 - o9.5 types , half of which of luminosity class v. we have then used the stellar models of schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) to derive the rate of ionising photons from the given spectral type and luminosity class .    following this recipe , we have produced 20 different stellar distribution realizations for each case in table  1 , to get some semblance of the scatter among different realizations .",
    "the scatter is produced by the random sampling of the number , position and ionising photon rate of individual stars in the simulation volume .    for simplicity",
    ", we have adopted a single black - body spectrum for each star .",
    "we have assumed a temperature of 40000  k , a mean value for the effective temperatures of o - type stars ( @xmath55 k ; schaerer & de koter , 1997 ) .",
    "the pattern of ionisation does not heavily depend on the detailed shape of the spectrum , as long as most of the ionising photons are emitted close to the hi ionisation limit .",
    "early b - type stars also produce ionising radiation . assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) and the ionising photon rate of schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) , we have estimated that b0-b0.5 stars contribute on average to less than 10% of the total number of ionising photons .",
    "we have run a few simulations to check the influence of b stars .",
    "the difference between models with and without b stars are masked by the random scatter in the results .",
    "therefore , we did not include b - type stars in the stellar distributions .",
    "to study the propagation of ionising radiation produced by the stars through the given ism density distribution we use the monte carlo ( mc ) radiative transfer code crash ( _ cosmological radiative transfer scheme for hydrodynamics _ ) , described in ciardi ( 2001 ) .",
    "the code has been originally developed for cosmological applications , but below we show that it can correctly handle also the rather different conditions prevailing in the interstellar medium of galaxies . for clarity , we briefly summarize the main features of the numerical scheme relevant to the present study .    in the application of a mc scheme to radiative transfer problems",
    ", the radiation intensity is discretized into a representative number of monochromatic photon packets .",
    "the processes involved ( e.g. packet emission and absorption ) are then treated statistically by randomly sampling the appropriate distribution function .",
    "the 1 kpc@xmath17 simulation volume has been discretized in @xmath56 grid cells ; we consider absorption by hi and dust ; we neglect the contribution of he because of the paucity of the he - ionising photons produced .",
    "we have estimated the dust optical depth in the optical using the canonical relation between the hi column density , @xmath57 , and the color excess e(b - v ) ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) .",
    "this has been converted into an optical depth at the ionisation limit by adopting the far - uv parametrization of the mean galactic extinction law ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) .",
    "we obtain : _",
    "d(912)=1.9 10 ^ -21 ( n_h/ cm^-2 ) , where we have excluded the contribution of dust scattering to the opacity , by multiplying for @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is the average albedo of dust in the uv close to the ionisation limit ( witt 1993 ) .",
    "given the above equation , as the final mean ionisation fraction for run a ( run b ) is @xmath60 ( 0.40 ) ( see section  4 ) , for the frequencies of interest here , we find that @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , dust contribution to absorption is negligible .    for the range of densities considered here , a number of photon packets equal to @xmath63 has to be emitted in order to reach numerical convergence .    differently from ciardi _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) , here we deal with more than one ionising source .",
    "we have found that , if the number of emitted packets is sufficiently high , a more reliable solution of the discretized time - dependent ionisation equation is obtained if the time step @xmath64 used in their eq .",
    "10 is not treated statistically .",
    "thus , here @xmath64 is the time elapsed since a photon packet has gone through the cell for which the equation is being solved . only photons escaping from the top side of the cubic region contribute to the escape fraction , while those escaping from side faces or the bottom one are subject to a reflecting boundary condition , thus simulating photons coming from adjacent regions .    the same numerical tests of the code described in ciardi _",
    "( 2001 ) have been performed in an interstellar ( rather than intergalactic ) environment .",
    "we do not report them here ; instead , in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] we show the evolution of ionised regions ( in black ) produced in the gdd described in the previous section , by sources with different ionisation rate , located on the disk midplane .",
    "the slices show a plane perpendicular to the galactic disk through each source location .",
    "different columns refer to different source ionisation rates ( @xmath65  s@xmath3 respectively , from left to right ) , while from the top to the bottom we show the ism ionisation structure at times @xmath66  myr after the source has been turned on .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the stationary analytical solution given in dove & shull ( 1994b ) .",
    "the ionisation rates were chosen in order to reproduce the various possible shapes of the ionised regions : spherical , elongated and funnel - like .    to prevent misunderstandings ,",
    "it is useful here to give our working definition of the escape fraction .",
    "we define the _ global _ escape fraction , @xmath67 , as : f_esc , g(t ) , [ fglob ] where @xmath68 is the escaping photon rate ( _ i.e. _ the number of photons reaching @xmath69  kpc per unit time ) and @xmath5 is the total photon rate production at ( simulation ) time @xmath70 .",
    "the _ instantaneous _ escape fraction , @xmath71 , is instead given by : f_esc , i(t ) .",
    "[ finst ]    in order to derive @xmath0 , we assume that the stars have a constant ionisation rate and we run the simulation until convergence ( the escape fraction and the ionisation structure do not change ) is reached . as we find that , after a time of @xmath72  yr the value of @xmath0 remains roughly constant , we stop the simulations after @xmath73  yr .",
    "this is expected as the recombination time at the midplane is 0.3 myr .    following the method described above",
    ", we have run 20 simulations for each of the cases indicated in table  1 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig03 ]",
    "we show the evolution of the global escape fraction , @xmath67 , as a function of the total ionisation rate , @xmath5 , for runs a ( filled triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig03]a ) and b ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig03]b ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath67 increases with increasing @xmath5 , although for the fdd with a flatter slope .",
    "the reason for this different behavior is that photons in a gdd can escape only if an ionised channel can be produced by the stars themselves .",
    "consequently , a low ionisation rate results in a low escape fraction . in a fdd instead , photons can travel along clear sigthlines through low density ionised channels and escape more easily .",
    "thus , for @xmath74  s@xmath3 @xmath67 is always higher for a fdd , while for larger ionisation rates a gdd becomes more transparent . in both cases , the scatter in @xmath67 is mainly due to differences in the star position and ionisation rate .",
    "0.5truecm    to study the effect of a larger total ionisation rate , we have increased the stellar surface density , as explained in section  2 , obtaining a maximum value @xmath75  s@xmath3 .",
    "these additional runs are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] as open triangles ( run c ) and circles ( run d ) . the scatter is reduced with respect to runs a and b as , increasing the number of stars , their position affects less sensibly the value of @xmath0 , which instead depends more strongly on the total ionisation rate . in order to check",
    "if the curve for the gdd would reach a plateau or rather keep growing ( as the analytical derivation by dove & shull 1994a suggests ) , we have increased the total ionisation rate up to a value of @xmath76  s@xmath3 ( corresponding to a stellar surface density of @xmath77  kpc@xmath49 ) .",
    "as we expect the scatter to be reduced , in order to limit the computational time , we have only run 6 different realizations .",
    "the evolution of @xmath67 is linear over the considered range of @xmath5 and it can be fitted by the following function : [ fitds ] f_esc , g=(_/10 ^ 50 s^-1)+ , where for a gdd ( fdd ) @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . in both cases",

    "we find that the gdd curve eventually flattens and departs from the fit in eq .",
    "[ fitds ] ; on the contrary the results for the fdd are well described by the same fit also for high values of @xmath5 .",

    "the value they obtained ( represented by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig03]a ) should be compared with the asymptotic value of @xmath71 . however , as for late evolutionary times @xmath67 approaches @xmath71 ( see below ) , we can compare their results with our runs a and c directly from fig .",
    "[ fig03]a . clearly , the evolution of @xmath67 differs from the analytic calculation and higher values for the escape fraction are obtained , especially for large ionisation rates .",

    "have been made with realistic assumptions for the ionizing stellar sources based on available data in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the main results obtained can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the global escape fraction , @xmath67 , in the case of a gaussian density distribution ( gdd ) rapidly increases with increasing total ionization rate , @xmath5 , and it flattens for high values of @xmath5 ; for a fractal density distribution ( fdd ) the dependence on @xmath5 is milder .",
    "\\(2 ) for @xmath74  s@xmath3 @xmath67 is always higher for a fdd , while for larger ionization rate a gdd becomes more transparent .",
    "\\(3 ) for low stellar surface densities , @xmath98 , there is a large scatter in the results , due to differences in the star positions and ionization rates .",
    "the scatter is reduced for larger @xmath98 , as the star position affects less sensibly the value of @xmath0 , which instead depends more strongly on @xmath5 .",
    "\\(4 ) in a gdd the photon escape is retarded and the time evolution of the escape fraction is steeper compared to the fdd case .",
    "\\(5 ) for a gdd we obtain a final mean hi column density of @xmath99  @xmath24 , lower than the observed one ; for a fdd , @xmath100  @xmath24 closely matches the experimental value . in all cases",
    ", the hii distribution appears to be more extended than the hi one .",
    "\\(6 ) the value of the escape fraction is more sensitive to the gas density rather than the stellar distribution .    in order to draw a more general conclusion from the results summarized above ,",
    "it is useful to translate the total ionization rate into a star formation rate for a given galaxy .",
    "to do so we use the results of the stellar population synthesis code starburst99 ( leitherer 1999 ) . assuming a continuous star formation mode , a salpeter imf with @xmath101 and @xmath102 and a metallicity equal to 1/20 of solar , we find that the expected ionization rate inside our simulated kpc@xmath17 produced by the corresponding stellar population is @xmath103 . from fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] we then note that for @xmath104 the escape fraction is already equal to roughly 0.6 ( 0.28 ) for the gdd ( fdd ) case .",
    "star formation rates of a few tens of solar masses are commonly derived from observations of lbgs ( pettini 2001 ) .",
    "this result may suggest a galaxy - dominated uv background .",
    "in fact , bianchi , cristiani & kim ( 2001 ) have recently shown that estimates of the local and high-@xmath19 meta - galactic ionizing flux are consistent with a galaxy - dominated background if @xmath105 .",
    "hence it appears that these type of sources , as long as they could be modelled as relatively normal disk galaxies , can strongly influence the ionization history of the intergalactic medium and , possibly , the galaxy formation process .    in principle , then , photons can escape rather efficiently ( particularly if their ism is smooth ) from high redshift galaxies , provided their vertical gas distribution is not too different from the milky - way type galaxies investigated here .",
    "although galactic disk models based on simple semi - analytical prescriptions ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ; ferrara , pettini & shchekinov 2000 ; wood & loeb 2000 ) predict that the disk column density should increase with redshift by a factor @xmath106 between the present value and redshift 5 , this estimate is still subject to several uncertainties .",
    "for example it is not clear how both the gas temperature ( governing the disk scaleheight ) and the fraction of baryons that are able to cool and settle in the disk ( determining the midplane gas density ) evolve with cosmic time . even if the column density is larger , we do expect that the galactic ism is smoother than the present day one , due to the short time interval available for the build up of a fully developed turbulent spectrum and hence a fractal gas distribution .",
    "this process might require several ( say , 10 ) eddy turnover times , @xmath107 , on the scale at which turbulence is injected by superbubbles , @xmath108  kpc ( norman & ferrara 1996 ) . if the characteristic eddy velocity is @xmath109  km  s@xmath3 , this implies that @xmath110  gyr is much longer than the hubble time at redshift 3 .",
    "hence , a final conclusion from models like the one presented here extended to encompass high redshift galaxies have to await additional data ( both observational and from galaxy formation models ) on the distribution and dynamical state of the gas in primordial galaxies .",
    "we would like to thank a. lorenzani and m. normandeau for help with the hi density distributions and the referee , k. wood , for useful comments .",
