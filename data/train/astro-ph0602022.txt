    "photon bubbles can greatly enhance the escape of radiation from magnetized , radiation pressure - dominated atmospheres .",
    "in photon bubble instability ( arons 1992 ; gammie 1998 ) , the atmosphere spontaneously forms a propagating pattern of low - density channels separated by regions of high density . the fastest growing inhomogeneities evolve to nonlinear amplitude , becoming a train of isothermal , gas pressure - dominated shocks ( begelman 2001 , hereafter b01 ; turner et al .",
    "radiation tends to escape through the underdense regions between the shocks , avoiding the regions of high density .",
    "the mean radiation flux exceeds the local eddington limit ( calculated using the local gravity , @xmath4 : shaviv 1998 ) by a factor that can approach the ratio of magnetic pressure to mean gas pressure , yet overall hydrostatic equilibrium is maintained by magnetic tension and the dynamic cycling of gas between high- and low - density phases . because the shocks tend to evolve toward larger separations and higher density contrasts , atmospheres susceptible to photon bubble instability can reach very high luminosities .    begelman ( 2002 , hereafter b02 ) argued that photon bubble shock trains may dominate the escape of radiation from the inner regions of radiation pressure - dominated accretion disks .",
    "such porous disks would be thinner than standard disks of the same luminosity . under extreme conditions",
    ", it may be possible for the total luminosity of the disk to exceed the global eddington luminosity by a large factor , without the disk being destroyed by mass loss .",
    "in this paper we attempt to flesh out the effects of photon bubbles on the vertical structure of accretion disks , and particularly on the structure of the disks surface layers and on mass loss in the super - eddington limit . our analysis is based on analytic and numerical calculations of photon bubbles assuming a static background with a uniform magnetic field .",
    "further simulations are required before we can answer the crucial question of whether photon bubbles form and grow in the presence of magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which generates a magnetic field that fluctuates in time and space .",
    "arguments based on instability growth rates ( reviewed in   3 ) suggest that the answer is yes .",
    "other issues are susceptible to analytic treatment now , and we focus on these .",
    "the b02 analysis paid too little attention to the effects of finite optical depth and radiation damping on the existence and properties of photon bubbles in accretion disks .",
    "these effects prove to be crucial .",
    "the basic mechanism of photon bubbles relies on the inverse relationship between radiation flux and density , predicted by the diffusion law . when the optical depth across a region of changing density becomes small , the coupling between flux and local density declines .",
    "this means that the denser regions see a higher flux than predicted by standard diffusion , while the neighboring tenuous regions see a smaller flux .",
    "radiation damping ( commonly known as  silk damping \" : silk 1968 ) is a separate effect , and results from radiative diffusion driven by the divergence of the velocity field .",
    "it is most important at high optical depths .",
    "the effects of finite optical depth become important when the overall optical depth through the atmosphere is still very large , because photon bubbles involve length scales much smaller than the scale height of the atmosphere . in   2 we generalize the nonlinear theory of photon bubbles to include the effects of finite optical depth . to do this",
    "we require a generalization of the radiation diffusion law , to take account of the nonlocal relationship between flux and density at low @xmath0 .",
    "the closure we describe in appendix a is based on the model by ruszkowski & begelman ( 2003 ) , modified to include radiation damping .",
    "we find that the crucial parameter is the optical depth for gas at the mean density , measured across a distance equal to the _ gas _ pressure scale height .",
    "this critical optical depth  @xmath5 , in our notation  is smaller than the total optical depth by a factor of order the ratio of gas pressure to radiation pressure .",
    "radiation damping impedes the existence of photon bubbles where the radiation diffusion time through the disk is longer than the gas sound crossing time .",
    "the ratio of these timescales gives rise to a second parameter , the damping parameter @xmath6 ( b01 ) .",
    "( note that b01 refers to @xmath6 as the  radiation drag \" parameter . ",
    "radiation damping \" is a more appropriate term than  radiation drag \" in this context , because the underlying radiation field is not fixed but rather responds to the flow ; see additional comments following eq .",
    "[ [ radentropy ] ] . )",
    "photon bubbles can exist only when @xmath6 is sufficiently small ; the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath5 determines the photon bubble behavior , as discussed in   2.2 .",
    "we apply the generalized theory of photon bubbles to radiation pressure - dominated accretion disks in   3 .",
    "below a certain accretion rate , corresponding to a luminosity of a few percent to tens of percent of the eddington limit ( depending on @xmath7 and the mass of the central object ) , radiation damping is too strong for photon bubbles to dominate the disk . at higher accretion rates ,",
    "photon bubbles begin to form within the radius where @xmath8 .",
    "since the radiative losses associated with photon bubbles are expected to increase strongly with decreasing @xmath6 at @xmath9 , we argue that there should be a feedback mechanism that keeps the disk core at @xmath8 at small @xmath10 .",
    "however , we also find that this self - regulated photon bubble loss mechanism is subject to the same thermal and viscous instabilities that plague standard radiation pressure - dominated @xmath3disks .",
    "we reaffirm our earlier result that steady state disks can exceed the eddington limit while remaining thin .    in   3.2 we show that disks dominated by photon bubble transport should form a vertical  core",
    " halo \" structure .",
    "the halo has a much lower density and pressure than the core , yet possesses enough optical depth to maintain photon bubbles well outside the core .",
    "where the luminosity is sub - eddington , the core smoothly merges into a homogeneous atmosphere at the expected height above the equator . for super - eddington luminosities the halo forms the base of a wind (   3.3 ) .",
    "we argue that the mass loss , while substantial , is unlikely to prevent highly super - eddington accretion . in effect , the halo insulates the disk core against excessive mass loss . in   3.4 , we comment on the effects of photon bubble transport on the color temperatures of disks .",
    "we summarize our results in   4 , where we also discuss important caveats and amplify on two potential applications of the model : to ultraluminous x - ray sources and the rapid growth of supermassive black holes .",
    "the essence of the photon bubble mechanism is the inverse relationship between radiation flux and density . at large optical depths",
    "the diffusion law for flux is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the opacity ( assumed constant ) and @xmath13 is the radiation pressure . in order to maintain hydrodynamical equilibrium",
    ", pressure gradients must be relatively weak , but density contrasts can be very strong .",
    "thus , radiation flux is excluded from dense regions while passing readily through regions of low density . in a photon bubble wave train ,",
    "the densest regions receive so little flux that they are supported against gravity by gas pressure gradients , whereas the low - density regions see a super - eddington flux and accelerate rapidly .",
    "this picture breaks down where large changes of density occur across regions of low optical depth , i.e. , where @xmath14 .",
    "the flux can not adjust over a length scale smaller than the photon mean free path . where density gradients are large",
    ", the dense regions will receive more flux than predicted by the usual diffusion law while the tenuous regions will receive less .",
    "we stress that we are considering localized density gradients within an otherwise optically thick atmosphere .",
    "thus , to a good approximation the radiation field is everywhere isotropic .",
    "it is the _ slight _ anisotropy , giving rise to the flux , that becomes decoupled from local changes in the density .    in this section",
    "we consider how the structure of a photon bubble shock train changes as the optical depth across the bubble decreases .",
    "effects of finite optical depth set in while the total optical depth across the bubble  @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean density and @xmath17 is the spacing between shocks  is still large .",
    "we shall see below that the critical optical depth , @xmath5 , is the much smaller optical depth across a gas pressure scale height , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the gas thermal speed and @xmath20 is the local gravitational acceleration . for @xmath21 ,",
    "photon bubbles are essentially unaffected by optical depth effects . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the density contrasts within photon bubbles are smaller , but the basic mechanism persists .",

    "acceptable values of @xmath403 would be increased by the reciprocal of this factor , and the mass loss rate would be correspondingly diminished .",
    "this argument should be valid provided that the total radiative luminosity is approximately conserved through the outflow , i.e. , if only a small fraction of the radiation flux is converted to kinetic energy .",
    "even if the mass loss is not catastrophic , the fact that it is a substantial fraction of the accretion rate means that the total kinetic luminosity of the wind .",
    "@xmath404 , is likely to be only a few times smaller than the radiative luminosity of the disk . for super - eddington luminosities",
    "this can represent a large flux of energy , which could dramatically affect the environment .",
    "normal accretion disks have color temperatures that exceed their effective temperatures because the radiation pressure at the  true \" photosphere , where the escaping radiation is thermalized , is larger than the radiation pressure at the scattering photosphere .",
    "typical color corrections , @xmath405 , lie in the range @xmath406 ( shimura & takahara 1995 ; davis et al .",
    "2005 ) , implying that thermalization occurs at a scattering optical depth @xmath407 .",
    "how does photon bubble transport affect disk color ?",
    "a detailed treatment of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , but we are able to make some comments about the expected trends .",
    "first , we note that the absorption opacity used to estimate thermalization effects should be evaluated at a density close to the maximum density found in the photon bubbles , @xmath408 , where @xmath16 is the mean density .",
    "although the densest gas occupies only a fraction @xmath409 of the volume , the absorption opacity @xmath410 is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the effective opacity is @xmath411^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath412 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "the absorption opacity ( presumably a mixture of free - free and bound - free opacities ) generally decreases with radiation pressure in lte  for free - free absorption we have @xmath413 , with a somewhat slower mean decline if bound - free transitions are important .",
    "first consider the disk core .",
    "compared to a standard disk at radius @xmath32 with the same @xmath235 and @xmath7 , the photon bubble - dominated disk has both higher pressure and higher density , @xmath414 and @xmath415 .",
    "we also have @xmath416 , therefore the effective opacity is higher than in the equivalent standard disk by a factor @xmath417 .",
    "the effective optical depth for thermalization scales as @xmath418 .",
    "thus , thermalization should be much more effective in photon bubble - dominated disk cores than in standard accretion disks , mainly because the typical densities are much higher .    because the density and pressure drop by roughly the same factor between the core and halo , effective opacities ( @xmath419 ) are unlikely to change by a large factor across the transition region .",
    "however , the large density drop ( by a factor @xmath420 ) implies a substantial decrease in the effective optical depth . whether the radiation is still thermalized in the lower parts of the halo therefore depends on details . toward the upper halo , the pressure is roughly constant , @xmath383 , and according to our estimates for case ( c ) photon bubble transport , @xmath421",
    ". therefore , the effective optical depth decreases @xmath422 .",
    "thermalization will certainly fail well below the top of the halo , where the scattering optical depth approaches unity .",
    "these general arguments should also apply to the wind , in the super - eddington case .",
    "if thermalization is still effective in the lower parts of the halo , the color correction should be close to unity , i.e. , photon bubble - dominated disks would be cooler than their standard counterparts of the same luminosity , by a factor of @xmath406 .",
    "the higher luminosities of super - eddington disks , of course , would offset a smaller color correction .",
    "roughly , we expect @xmath423 .",
    "therefore , a @xmath424 black hole radiating at @xmath425 with no color correction would still appear hotter than a @xmath426 black hole radiating at the eddington limit with @xmath427 , but only by a factor of 1.6 . if some thermalization occurred further out in the wind , or if radiation trapping were important in the outflow , then the color temperature of the low mass hole could be smaller .",
    "we have attempted to refine and flesh out our earlier treatment ( b02 ) of the possible role of photon bubbles in accretion disks .",
    "the speculative nature of this work can not be overemphasized , especially given the fact that it is unknown whether highly nonlinear photon bubbles develop in the presence of hydromagnetic turbulence generated by mri .",
    "we are motivated to take an optimistic view by the fact that photon bubbles develop in uniform fields on timescales much shorter than the timescales that characterize mri ( gammie 1998 ; b02 ; turner et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , the fact that mri appears to predict a predominantly horizontal magnetic field suggests that field coherence may be adequate to support photon bubbles of moderately long wavelength ( and therefore of large density contrast ) .",
    "nevertheless , the time - dependence of the field , as well as its small - scale structure , could very well prove fatal to the premises upon which this paper is based .",
    "at least , it is hoped that the arguments presented in this paper will help to frame future radiation hydrodynamical simulations , which will settle these questions .",
    "our analysis is based on an analytic model of photon bubbles as a periodic train of planar , isothermal shocks mediated by gas pressure ( b01 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is sufficiently stiff that it enforces one - dimensional motion .",
    "the general validity of this model has been verified by numerical simulations ( turner et al .",
    "however , photon bubbles in accretion disk cores occupy a part of parameter space that had not been analyzed previously .",
    "first , the optical depth across low density regions of the photon bubble , as measured by the parameter @xmath5  the optical depth for gas at the mean density , across the _ gas _ pressure scale height  is predicted to be small .",
    "the usual diffusion law relating flux to the radiation pressure gradient and the density has to be modified , since the flux can not adjust to changes in density across distances shorter than a photon mean free path .",
    "we therefore generalized the closure to the radiation hydrodynamics equations described by ruszkowski & begelman ( 2003 ) , to take account of fluid motions ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this generalization greatly complicated the equation describing the photon bubble structure (   2 ) , changing it from a first- to a third - order nonlinear differential equation .",
    "nevertheless , the generic flow pattern , with a critical point at some characteristic flow speed , is preserved , and we were able to approximate the principal features of photon bubbles at finite and low optical depths .",
    "most importantly , we found a tendency for the low - density parts of the photon bubble to  fill in , \" so that the optical depth across any scale length never becomes much smaller than one .",
    "another new behavior , which appears as long a radiation damping is sufficiently weak , is an increase in the photon bubble phase speed to values well above the gas sound speed .",
    "second , radiation damping is predicted to be important in accretion disks . a damping parameter @xmath6  essentially the ratio of the radiation diffusion time to the sound crossing time in the gas  was included in the b01 models , which apply ( with some minor corrections : see turner et al .",
    "2005 ) for @xmath100 .",
    "we extended the analysis to include the effects of damping at finite and small optical depth .",
    "although we were not able to provide a rigorous proof , it appears that photon bubbles with large density contrasts can form only when @xmath9 or , more precisely , when @xmath6 is less than some value which depends on the orientation of the shock fronts and the magnetic field but which is probably @xmath344 in practice . as in the case of photon bubbles at large @xmath0 , the  eddington enhancement factor \" @xmath220",
    " which is the ratio of the flux to the _ local _ eddington flux , @xmath428 , and not to the global eddington limit  is given essentially by the ratio of the mean density to the minimum density , as first pointed out by shaviv ( 1998 ) .",
    "we applied our simple photon bubble theory to a one - zone @xmath3model for the equatorial region of the disk around a black hole .",
    "the treatment resembles standard models for radiation pressure - supported disks except for the inclusion of @xmath220 as a free parameter . where photon bubbles do not exist , @xmath429 . in the absence of photon bubbles , @xmath6 increases with @xmath10 , implying that damping prevents the formation of photon bubbles beyond a certain radius . for accretion disks less luminous than about @xmath430 ( for an accretion efficiency of @xmath431 ) , @xmath230 at all radii and photon bubbles can not form .    for more luminous disks , the onset of radiative transport by photon bubbles , at the radius where @xmath6 first drops below @xmath174 , causes @xmath220 to increase with decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "in a steady state with constant @xmath235 , unchecked energy loss via photon bubbles would increase @xmath6 to the point where photon bubble formation shuts off again .",
    "we therefore deduce that there is a feedback mechanism , which should regulate the amount of energy transported by photon bubbles so that @xmath8 .",
    "the photon bubble density contrasts required to maintain such an equilibrium are small compared to the maximum values permitted by photon bubble theory , lending credence to the conjecture that such contrasts could be attained under turbulent conditions .",
    "this feedback mechanism , which should operate on a dynamical timescale , makes specific predictions about the thermal and viscous stability of disks dominated by photon bubble transport . under the assumptions of an @xmath3model viscosity , we find that the steady state solution with @xmath8 does not cure the well - known thermal and viscous instabilities that plague radiation pressure - dominated disks . an alternative outcome , in view of this instability ,",
    "is that there is no steady accretion . instead",
    ", the inner disk might cycle through a sequence of states in which the surface density builds up at small @xmath6 , where the disk is thin and viscous transport inefficient , and is subsequently depleted by accretion or evaporation of a thickened disk , without photon bubbles , at large @xmath6 .",
    "recall from ",
    "3.1.1 that both thermal and viscous instabilities _ can _ be quenched by photon bubble transport if @xmath432 and the photon bubbles are able to approach the maximum permitted density contrast .",
    "steady state disk cores with @xmath8 can liberate super - eddington luminosities via photon bubble transport .",
    "this result is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the conclusion we reached in b02 , although the details of the photon bubble transport model , especially the feedback effect , are different .",
    "the predicted maximum luminosity depends weakly on mass , with @xmath433 .",
    "super - eddington luminosities necessarily drive winds .",
    "as the disk density declines , its ability to support photon bubbles with large density contrasts decreases . as @xmath220 decreases , the mean force exerted by the escaping radiation increases , driving the wind .",
    "in particular , if the advected flux @xmath434 exceeds the diffusive flux , then the mass loss will probably decimate the accretion disk , decreasing @xmath235 at such a rate ( @xmath435 ) that the luminosity can not significantly exceed @xmath2 .",
    "our approximate analysis suggests that the diffusive flux probably prevails , allowing most of the accreted matter to reach the inner disk .",
    "although this argument is tentative and will require detailed confirmation , it suggests that super - eddington luminosities need not be compromised by mass loss .",
    "mass loss could also be reduced if gas becomes trapped on closed flux loops anchored in the disk ( b02 ; socrates & davis 2005 ) .",
    "we have already emphasized the overwhelming caveat of this paper : that the incoherence and time - dependence of the magnetic field might prevent the formation of photon bubbles in accretion disks altogether . in this section",
    "we describe a number of other significant uncertainties related to the arguments presented .",
    "we used a highly approximate radiative transfer model to estimate the effects of finite optical depth on photon bubbles . the closure proposed in rb",
    "was tested against monte carlo calculations of radiative transfer through plane - parallel slabs .",
    "this test provides a reasonable facsimile of conditions in photon bubbles , and gives reasonable agreement ( although the agreement is somewhat worse after the correction of an error in rb ; see appendix a ) however , for the present problem we were required to generalize this closure to include the effects of motion",
    ". no comparable tests of been done of the generalized model .",
    "we did not solve the full , third - order nonlinear differential equation for photon bubble structure in the presence of finite optical depths .",
    "the full equation is two - point boundary value problem with a critical point and eigenvalue , in which the boundary conditions depend on each other and on the eigenvalue . to obtain a quick estimate of the functional dependence of the solutions on parameters",
    ", we devised an approximate method to find asymptotic solutions close to solutions that cross the critical point .",
    "we have no way of knowing how accurate this scheme is , although it gives reasonable ( though not perfect ) results in the high-@xmath5 limit .",
    "we were also unable to prove that no high - contrast solutions exist for large @xmath6 , although the approximate method suggests that this is the case .",
    "we adopted a simple , one - zone model for the disk core structure , assuming that the density scale height coincides with the thickness of the dissipation layer at each radius .",
    "however , simulations suggest that much of the dissipation may occur outside the density core ( miller & stone 2000 ; turner 2004 ; hirose et al .",
    "if the bulk of the dissipation occurs at high optical depth , but outside the density core , then @xmath6 will be systematically lower than our estimates indicate .",
    "photon bubble transport could then be important at larger radii and larger accretion rates . in this sense ,",
    "our one - zone model is a  worst - case scenario \" for assessing the potential importance of photon bubble transport . on the other hand ,",
    "if most of the dissipation occurs at such low optical depths that photon bubbles can not form ( e.g. , socrates & davis 2005 ) , then the issue of photon bubble transport is moot .",
    "a related issue concerns the likely absence of photon bubbles deep within the disk core .",
    "@xmath6 is a monotonically decreasing function of height , formally blowing up at the equator where the vertical gravity vanishes .",
    "this suggests that in a disk core with @xmath326 , photon bubbles could exist only in the surface layers .",
    "what happens if a sizable fraction of the dissipation occurs near the equator , where photon bubble transport is absent ?",
    "if this energy were carried to the photon bubble - dominated zone by radiative diffusion , it would puff up the disk core to the point that super - eddington luminosities would be impossible .",
    "however , this is probably not what happens .",
    "the existence of the photon bubble - dominated zone acts like a drop in opacity near the surface , which causes the specific entropy to decrease with height in the disk interior and can drive strong convection down to the equatorial zone .",
    "we demonstrate this effect explicitly in appendix b , by constructing and solving a toy model .",
    "this model shows that the ratio of convective to diffusive flux is determined by effective porosity of the disk near the surface ; for photon bubble transport the ratio is @xmath436 .",
    "as long as the viscosity parameter @xmath7 is @xmath437 , the required convective motions are highly subsonic and the convection can be efficient ( see , e.g. , blaes & socrates 2003 ; turner et al .",
    "there is no problem with convection transporting a super - eddington flux .",
    "the damping parameter @xmath6 is also affected by the orientation of the shock fronts , represented by the parameter @xmath309 with @xmath438 .",
    "we arbitrarily set @xmath439 to a fixed value associated with the fastest growing linear photon bubble modes in the high-@xmath5 limit .",
    "although this assumption seems consistent with large-@xmath5 simulations at low @xmath6 ( turner et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is possible that the dominant orientation would be affected by damping , or that @xmath439 would adjust to local conditions so that @xmath6 remains small over a much wider range of conditions than we have assumed .",
    "likewise , we adopted a very simple prescription for the effects of photon bubbles in the halo and wind , assuming that @xmath220 would be close to the maximum permitted value where @xmath231 , but would rapidly decrease with @xmath440 for @xmath441 .",
    "this was the basis for the proposed feedback mechanism , but it ignores the dependence of damping effects on the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the photon bubble shock fronts .",
    "also , we adopted a simple prescription for determining the maximum @xmath220 , based on the maximum allowed photon bubble wavelength or the maximum density contrast permitted by the magnetic field strength .",
    "finally , we modeled only the density inhomogeneities due to photon bubble shock trains propagating in a static magnetic field , under the influence of the vertical component of gravity .",
    "there are other ways of creating inhomogeneities in a radiation - dominated accretion disk , and since enhanced radiation transport is a generic characteristic of highly inhomogeneous atmospheres ( shaviv 1998 ) , we may have underestimated the disk porosity .",
    "in particular , the accelerations associated with mri would create transient zones of artificial gravity that could lead to the formation of photon bubbles close to the disk equator .",
    "accelerations associated with magnetic tension on curved field lines  also driven by mri  would create density inhomogeneities via a mechanism akin to the parker ( 1966 ) instability .",
    "inhomogeneities with density contrasts of order the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the mean gas pressure are seen in radiation ",
    "mhd shearing - box simulations ( turner , stone , & sano 2002 ; turner et al .  2003 ;",
    "turner 2004 ) ; the extent to which these result from photon bubbles remains to be determined .      in b02",
    ", we discussed several applications of photon bubble - dominated accretion disks , most notably , ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs : fabbiano 1989 ; colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) and rapidly accreting supermassive black holes . here",
    "we briefly amplify on these suggestions , based on our new results .",
    "it remains controversial whether ulxs are intermediate - mass black holes radiating at sub - eddington luminosities , or stellar - mass black holes radiating at a few times @xmath2 ( or whether there are two classes : watarai et al .",
    "our new analysis suggests that several aspects of photon bubble - dominated disks may make it difficult to distinguish these cases . at a given luminosity , the higher color temperatures associated with smaller disks around lower mass black holes would tend to make super - eddington disks appear hotter . some ulxs appear hotter than typical black - hole accretion disks ( makishima et al .",
    "2000 ; mizuno et al .",
    "2001 ) while others appear cooler ( miller , fabian , & miller 2004 ) .",
    "however , we saw in   3.4 that the color corrections of photon bubble - dominated disks could be smaller than those of standard disks .",
    "this would partially compensate for the smaller surface area , although the super - eddington disks probably would still be warmer .",
    "radiation trapping effects  although we expect them to be modest  would work in the same direction , with photon energies adiabatically shifted to lower values .",
    "another possibility is that the accretion rate at large @xmath10 exceeds the maximum allowed by photon bubble transport .",
    "such disks could also produce super - eddington luminosities , but with @xmath235 decreasing toward smaller @xmath10 according to eq .",
    "( [ mdmax ] )",
    ". the energy output would be much less centrally concentrated than in a mass - conserving disk , and the spectrum should be considerably cooler . in this case , the mass loss would be driven directly from the thick disk , without the intermediary halo .",
    "radiation trapping could be much more important , which could reduce the color temperature further .",
    "we note that a similar model was proposed by watarai , mizuno & mineshige ( 2001 ) .",
    "finally , we point out that the winds from super - eddington disks would have scattering photospheres at radii several times larger than their points of origin",
    ". this could smear out variability at the high frequencies associated with qpos from stellar - mass black holes , although lower frequencies would not be affected ( strohmayer & mushotzky 2003 ) .",
    "super - eddington accretion could lead to the very rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts .",
    "accretion rates could exceed the eddington value by 12 orders of magnitude ( depending on black hole mass ) , leading to e - folding times shorter than the salpeter time by 12 orders of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath442 million years for seed black holes of stellar mass , decreasing to a few hundred thousand years for @xmath443 .",
    "although we have argued that mass loss need not decimate a super - eddington accretion disk , the wind would probably carry an appreciable fraction of the luminosity in kinetic energy , and would therefore have a substantial effect on the surrounding protogalaxy .",
    "the release of so much energy on such a short timescale ( shorter than the dynamical time of all but the innermost regions of the galaxy ) would be like setting off a bomb in the middle of the protogalaxy , rather than a quasi - steady wind .",
