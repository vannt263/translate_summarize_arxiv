    "particle in cell codes have an inherent noise associated with them due to finite number of particles per cell .",
    "while performing these simulations , the two most important numerical criteria that we paid attention to were : i ) excellent conservation of total energy ( less than a few percent of change in any fluctuation energy ) and , ii ) the particle noise in the spectrum was significant only at scales much smaller than the scales of interest ( debye length @xmath20 for pic and @xmath21 for hybrid pic ) . on this basis ,",
    "the modest number of particles employed here was considered adequate . as an additional measure",
    ", we employed filtering ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to remove particle noise at grid scales prior to computing gradients ( e.g. vorticity ) .",
    "the most commonly discussed coherent structures in plasma physics are current sheets and reconnection sites .",
    "however , these current concentrations are also locations of strong vorticity generation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this phenomenon , often overlooked in reconnection studies , may be completely understood in terms of two dimensional mhd , which we briefly review here .",
    "the relevant equations of motion for two dimensonal ( 2d ) incompressible mhd can be written as ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath22    in terms of the @xmath23-component of vorticity @xmath24 and the magnetic potential @xmath25 , where the fluctuating magnetic field is @xmath26 .",
    "the terms involving resistivity @xmath27 and viscosity @xmath28 are dissipative and become important at small scales .",
    "although highly simplified , these contain the basic physics that establishes sites of magnetic reconnection , as in for example the well - known sweet parker model @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the vorticity equation ( [ eq : om ] ) is that when @xmath29 , kelvin s theorem applies and vorticity can not be generated in the interior of the magnetofluid .",
    "however the term @xmath30 , the curl of the lorentz force , can generate vorticity , just as sheared velocity fields can stretch magnetic field lines and amplify the mean square current density . taken together these two effects",
    "are responsible for amplification of gradients and the enhancement of dissipation that drive important relaxation processes in mhd @xcite .",
    "figure ( [ enst ] ) provides a simple demonstration that vorticity generation is also operative in a kinetic plasma .",
    "the figure shows the change in magnetic enstrophy ( mean square electric current density @xmath31 ) and the enstrophy ( mean square vorticity @xmath32 ) measured relative to their respective initial values for the hybrid run .",
    "both @xmath33 and @xmath34 increase until a maximum value is reached after one or two nonlinear times .",
    "this behavior is familiar from mhd turbulence simulations that begin from band limited initial conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the peak time being called in that case `` the peak of dissipation '' .",
    "note that prior to the peak time , the mean square current increases somewhat more rapidly than the enstrophy .",
    "this behavior is common to all the kinetic turbulence simulations of this type , and also in mhd turbulence simulations with band limited initial data and fairly large and approximately equal reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers . in both mhd and the kinetic case ,",
    "this effect is indicative of the vorticity generation that is secondary to current sheet formation .        to further discuss vorticity generation ,",
    "consider a purely 2d , or nearly 2d , geometry , and consider two oppositely directed flux tubes that encounter each other , generating a current enhancement ( say , in the positive z - direction ) with a single maximum centered on the origin in the @xmath35-@xmath36 plane , reminiscent of typical 2d reconnection geometry .",
    "then @xmath37 is directed towards the origin in all four quadrants .",
    "the main magnetic field of the tubes is such that @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 ( and we neglect the axial @xmath23- component of magnetic field for this demonstration . )",
    "one recognizes immediately @xcite that the generation term @xmath42 is positive in the first and fourth quadrants , and negative in the second and fourth quadrants .",
    "that is a standard scenario of flux tube interactions giving rise to a current enhancement ( filament or sheet ) .",
    "once the current enhancement is formed , will also generate a vorticity quadrupole structure as shown in figure [ vq - cartoon ] .",
    "central current sheet from pic otv simulation ( rotated by 30 degrees for clarity ) .",
    "@xmath43 coordinates in arbitrary units .",
    "( top ) magnetic field lines ( black ) ; and approximate directions of @xmath37 ( red arrows ) .",
    "( bottom ) smoothed contours of vorticity ( solid positive , dashed negative ) superposed over shading for current intensity .",
    "@xmath30 matches the signs of locally generated vorticity .",
    "[ vq - cartoon ]    it is noteworthy that the vorticity structures produced in this way necessarily form on the flanks of strong current enhancements .",
    "moreover , the thickness of vortex structures produced in this way should be comparable to the thickness of the current sheet that drives them , in this case a few @xmath21 .",
    "the similarity of vortex and current sheet thicknesses has been noted for example in the low beta weakly three dimensional reduced mhd description of turbulence @xcite .",
    "furthermore qualitative evidence for this can be seen in fully kinetic pic simulations @xcite that electron vorticity structures as well as current structures extend down to electron scales , although correlations were not computed in that study .",
    "the generation of vortex quadrupoles is a purely magnetohydrodynamic phenomenon that does not require any higher order effects like compressibility , hall physics or any other kinetic effects .",
    "therefore it is not entirely surprising that we can readily demonstrate that vortex quadrupole formation also occurs near current sheets in kinetic plasma simulation . for this",
    "we refer to the first two panels on the left side of each row in figure ( [ jzwap ] ) .",
    "the top row shows an early time snapshot of the relatively ordered orszag - tang initial condition @xcite , here simulated with a pic code .",
    "the dynamics results immediately in several orderly current filaments , for example , the one that is found in the center of the simulation ( first column , first row ) .",
    "one immediately sees clean vortex quadrupoles ( second column , first row ) forming near each current sheet , precisely as expected from the above reasoning .",
    "the second row shows small portion of a much less orderly turbulence - style initial condition , from a hybrid pic run . here",
    "one sees many current sheets and filaments , highly distorted , and also a complex pattern of vorticity .",
    "although in this case it is difficult to recognize the pattern of vorticity generation , we will see below that correlation statistics account for an interpretation very similar to what is seen in the simpler orszag - tang case .",
    "vortex quadrupoles form in kinetic plasma very much in the same way that they form in mhd , on the flanks of current sheets .",
    "therefore one may also expect distinctive kinetic features to appear , such as  viscous like \" heating and thermal energy transport , given that the sharpest current sheets often form with a thickness a few times the ion inertial scale @xmath21 . the basic mechanism for generating these kinetic effects",
    "can be thought of as a nonlinear generalization of landau resonance , as one may understand based on a simple physical argument .",
    "protons gyrate in a left - handed sense about a uniform magnetic field .",
    "fluid elements , defined here as parcels of plasma following bulk motion as defined by the first moment of the distribution funcion , rotate in a right handed sense relative to the local vorticity vector @xmath44 . therefore in locations where @xmath45 is positive ,",
    "the protons gyrate opposite to the vortical motion of the fluid element . in a low collisionality or collisionless plasma , individual particles",
    "are not tightly coupled to fluid elements as they are in collisional gas dynamics , so under varying circumstances , protons may change fluid elements more or less rapidly .",
    "clearly when the senses of rotation of particle and fluid element are mismatched , the protons have a higher probability of jumping from one fluid element to another one .",
    "a given fluid element will lose particles rapidly , but also gain particles that originate in elements that have different average velocities .",
    "regionally there will be an exchange and interchange of fluid energy and random thermal energy .",
    "intuitively this results either in an enhancement of heat transport , or an increase of thermal energy , or both .",
    "the opposite happens in locations where @xmath45 is negative and hence the vortical motion of the fluid element and the proton gyration match . in this case",
    "the proton distribution has a higher probability of losing energy .",
    "this can be understood in a simple way . for definiteness suppose that plasma beta is unity and a current sheet of a few @xmath21 thickness generates a ( circular ) vortex enhancement with similar dimension .",
    "then particles gyrating in the same sense of the vortex will remain within the vortex provided that their thermal speed is not much larger than the alfvn speed .",
    "but higher energy particles - those in the tail of the distribution  will rapidly scatter away as their gyro - orbits exceed the dimension of the vortex . similarly",
    "cooler particles that scatter into the vortex will easily be picked up by the fluid due to the @xmath46 drift effect .",
    "the next effect is that the fluid elements in a @xmath47 vortex should have cooler protons .",
    "indeed , previous studies have demonstrated that there is a viscous - like effect associated with shear @xcite or vorticity @xcite including the dependence on the sign of @xmath48 .",
    "a recent hybrid simulation study @xcite confirms that there is an association of kinetic effects , including proton temperature and proton temperature anisotropy , with this signed quantity @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is useful to recall a well - known general relationship that exists between _ global _ increase of internal energy and velocity gradients .",
    "this can be obtained from the vlasov equation in suitable ( e.g. , periodic ) boundaries using elementary manipulations . specifically , it is straightforward to show that the kinetic energy @xmath49 associated with random motions of any one species ( say , protons ) obeys the equation @xcite    @xmath50    in terms of the particle velocity @xmath51 , the fluid velocity of this species @xmath52 , and the pressure tensor @xmath53 .",
    "the angle brackets @xmath54 denote a volume average .",
    "since the pressure tensor is always symmetric in indices , the full contraction @xmath55 involves contributions only from the symmetric part of @xmath56 . in general",
    "one can write @xmath57 where @xmath58 represents the compressional part , @xmath59 is the traceless symmetric stress tensor , and the antisymmetric stress is @xmath60 .",
    "the several considerations described in the present section and the previous one , including the references , provide the basis for the next section , in which we further unravel the complex kinetic processes that occur near coherent structures in turbulence .",
    "we should remark at this point that our main effort here pertains to current and vortex structures , but reconnecting current sheets will typically also occur near in regions where one also finds shocks , compressions and various linear waves , e.g. , in the reconnection exhausts .",
    "all these phenomena may occur at least roughly in the vicinity of a current sheet .",
    "the typical location of these secondary structures is within a few @xmath21s of a current sheet and hence practically the same location in a system that extends to many decades in @xmath21 . in large systems ( large reynolds numbers ) the sites of vorticity generation",
    "may be so small that they are difficult to identify and hardly distinguishable in location from their companion current sheets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the proton temperature effects of vorticity generated near current sheets are clearly demonstrated in the case of the orderly orszag - tang vortex , as was the presence of the vortex quadrupole itself . in the third column , top row of figure [ jzwap ] , we see an illustration of the change in proton temperature from its initial value @xmath61 for this case , with the analogous plot from the more complex turbulence run in the second row",
    ". in the orszag - tang case one clearly sees that positive vorticity lobes ( @xmath62 of the central quadrupole are hotter , while the corresponding negative lobes are cooler .",
    "the fourth panel on each row of the same figure shows differential proton anisotropy @xmath63 for each case .",
    "we also observe that the perpendicular anisotropy is greater in the hotter @xmath64 lobes while the cooler @xmath65 lobes have parallel anisotropy ( negative @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is of course tempting to associate this phenomenon with the vorticity , as discussed by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we will discuss a nuance of this interpretation further below .",
    "an additional diagnostic in the orszag tang pic run is the relative heating of protons and electrons , shown in the final panel , top row of figure [ jzwap ] . out of many possible ways to quantify relative proton electron heating , we choose to work with differential relative heating defined by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the initial proton and electron temperatures .",
    "@xmath70 is positive where the percentage increase in proton temperature is more than percentage change in electron temperature and vice versa . in the last panel of top row in figure [ jzwap ]",
    "it is evident that the @xmath62 lobes , with hot , more anisotropic protons , also have a proton population heated more than the electron population .",
    "the cooler , @xmath71 lobes have more electron heating than proton heating .",
    "in fact , beginning at the central current sheet ( near the x - point ) and moving outward along the current sheet flanks , one sees first ( at the center ) hotter electrons , then a region with almost equal proton and electron heating ( along the flanks ) , and finally ( outside the flanks ) regions of hotter protons .",
    "clearly , the organization of the vorticity into a quadrupolar structure is closely related to the spatial organization of kinetic activity and heating near the current sheet . turning to the more turbulent hybrid run ( second row , fig .",
    "[ jzwap ] ) , we see that the proton temperature increase and the proton temperature anisotropy have a very patchy behavior . in this case",
    "it is more efficacious to carry out a statistical analysis , as done by @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the turbulent cases , we examine the association of kinetic effects with @xmath45 , by computing conditional probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "for example we may look at @xmath66 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , extracting separate distributions , from the pic simulation data depending on selected ranges of the values of @xmath74 .",
    "these ranges are ( i ) @xmath75 ; ( ii ) @xmath76 ; and and finally ( iii ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the rms value of proton vorticity . the resulting distributions for the pic run turb812 are shown in figure [ pdfspic ] where one sees immediately that the most probable values of @xmath66 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 systematically change with the selected ranges of vorticity .",
    "large positive @xmath74 gives enhanced likelihood of hotter protons , more anisotropic protons and protons hotter than electrons .",
    "for highly negative @xmath74 one finds colder protons , lower anisotropy ( parallel dominated ) and relatively hotter electrons .",
    "this indicates a clear correlation between higher and anisotropic proton heating with positive @xmath79 , consistent with the findings derived from inspection of the orszag tang pic results described above , and consistent with the findings of @xcite based on hybrid simulation .",
    "( middle ) @xmath66 ; and ( bottom ) @xmath80 . in each case",
    "the pdfs are computed for three rages of vorticity values : ( i ) @xmath81 ; ( ii ) @xmath82 , and ( iii ) @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the r.m.s .",
    "value of vorticity . ]     conditioned on three ranges of vorticity ; ( middle ) @xmath85 conditioned on three ranges of vorticity ; ( bottom ) @xmath86 conditioned on three ranges of current density . ]",
    "the pic simulation has a relatively complete description of the physics but is necessarily of smaller system size ( 25.6 @xmath21 ) and therefore smaller effective reynolds number . for a higher reynolds number view of the physics in fig .",
    "( [ pdfspic ] ) , we turn again to a hybrid run ( 204.8 @xmath21 ) .",
    "conditional distributions for our hybrid run are shown in fig .",
    "[ pdfshybrid ] . in this case",
    "( top to bottom ) , we plot the distribution of proton temperatures @xmath72 conditioned on ranges of vorticity , the distribution of proton temperature anisotropy conditions of ranges of vorticity , and the distribution of @xmath72 conditioned on ranges of the @xmath87 . here",
    "we find that proton heating is associated with both vorticity and current density but that the association with vorticity is the stronger of the two effects .",
    "having confirmed the expected statistical relations between vorticity and proton kinetic effects for the turbulent cases , it remains to quantify the spatial relationships between current sheets , vorticity concentrations , and kinetic effects .",
    "we accomplish this using two point correlations computed over the whole simulation domain .",
    "figure [ corshybrid ] and figure [ corspic ] show such correlations for the hybrid and pic runs , respectively .",
    "the top panel shows correlations between vorticity and current for the hybrid run .",
    "as current sheets are typically accompanied by vorticity generated in a quadrupole configuration , we find , on average , that the correlation between signed @xmath74 and @xmath88 is close to zero for most part .",
    "in contrast , correlation curve for the _ unsigned _ @xmath74 and @xmath88 clearly peaks at zero and drops to @xmath89 value in about @xmath90 as shown by the vertical green dashed line in fig .",
    "[ corshybrid ] .",
    "this indicates the close juxtapostion of vorticity quadrupoles and current sheets .",
    "the numerical resolution in this simulation is @xmath91 . because of the coarse grid , the current sheets generally do not collapse to electron scales and hence the correlation between current sheets and vorticity goes to @xmath92 .",
    "the correlations for signed vorticity and @xmath72 drops in a few @xmath21s but the correlation of @xmath72 with current drops in about @xmath90 like the correlation between vorticity and current .",
    "this is a direct quantification of the assertion that vorticity and kinetic effects , such as proton heating , occur  near \" current sheets and that the vorticity structures are prime locations of energy exchange between fields and particles .",
    "the final panel of fig .",
    "( [ corshybrid ] ) shows the strong correlation between vorticity and proton anisotropy .    for completeness",
    ", we show similar correlations for the pic run turb812 in figure [ corspic ] . the correlations between vorticity and proton temperature as well as anisotropy drops to @xmath89 value in less than a @xmath21 .",
    "this simulation had extremely fine grid scale , affording the possibility of collapse of current sheets to electron scales .",
    "hence the correlations of proton heating and anisotropy to vorticity and current are much tighter than the hybrid run .",
    "the final panel of figure [ corspic ] shows the correlation between current / vorticity and @xmath70 which also peaks at zero and drops to @xmath89 value in less than a @xmath21 .",
    "there is no clear correlation between @xmath73 and current .",

    "the two can be seen to have strong proximity to each other .",
    "the proximity is further quantified by the two point correlation of these variables .",
    "it drops to @xmath89 value in about @xmath94 as shown by the vertical dashed blue line . ]",
    "in this paper we have examined several ways in which vorticity enters into the dynamical activity near current sheets , thus contributing to an increasingly familiar scenario in which sharp gradients and coherent structures contribute to dissipation , kinetic effects including anisotropies , and heating .",
    "the most studied cases of coherent structures in space plasmas have been current sheets or reconnection sites @xcite , at least in part due to the availability of magnetic field data from spacecraft with sufficient resolution to attain accurate detection at scales at or approaching kinetic scales .",
    "one would fully expect however that additional plasma variables such as velocity ( and density , not shown here ; however see @xcite ) will be involved in intermittency and formation of coherent structures .",
    "in fact there have been numerous recent indications that velocity gradients might be responsible for heating the plasma through a linear instability mechanism @xcite or a viscous like interaction @xcite .",
    "the conclusion that velocity gradients contribute to proton kinetic effects is supported by recent simulation @xcite , and based on solar wind observation @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions may be extended to sharp gradients in density as well as velocity and magnetic field .    in this context",
    "we may summarize our main conclusions , and suggest a broader context .",
    "kinetic plasma turbulence forms current sheets , which like their mhd counterparts , generate vorticity nearby , in regions of strong current gradients .",
    "various kinetic effects and heating of both protons and electrons take place in the vicinity of these current and vortex structures .",
    "we have shown here ( see also @xcite ) that proton heating and anisotropy is better associated with vorticity rather than current , which provides some clarification to results that have shown @xcite that various kinetic effects are concentrated in the general vicinity of current sheets .",
    "the idea that kinetic effects concentrate near current sheets in turbulence might easily extend to include effects such as flux pile - up , density compressions and particle trapping in secondary islands .",
    "all of these are likely features of the dynamics when current sheets form between interacting magnetic flux tubes . in this way",
    ", it may be useful to think of the the general region within a few @xmath21 neighborhood a strong current sheet as a kind of complex or generalized coherent structure involving juxtaposition of coherent structures in several variables  current , density , vorticity , compressions , heating to name a few .",
    "this agglomeration has been demonstrated to span a range of scales , e.g. , from proton to electron inertial scales in the shear driven turbulent current sheets reported by @xcite .    for large systems sizes and large effective reynolds numbers",
    "it is likely that the dynamical interactions among several types of coherent structures become an important feature of the overall dynamics . in that case",
    "a fuller understanding of the complex dynamics within a `` generalized coherent structure '' becomes essential .",
    "here we described a first step  a simple dynamical chain that leads from current sheet formation to vorticity quadrupole generation and emergence of enhanced proton kinetic effects .",
    "one can actually see readily that even this situation must be more complex than we have described so far : from eq .",
    "[ eq : random ] we can deduce ( see also @xcite ) that increase of internal energy , or heating in the collisonless limit must be associated with the full contraction of the pressure tensor with the gradient tensor @xmath95 .",
    "however , the pressure tensor is symmetric and gradient tensor may be written as as sum of symmetric strain and antisymmetric strain , the latter containing the vorticity . therefore the only the symmetric stress and not the vorticity contributes directly to heating in the absence of collisions .",
    "so why do we see an association of vorticity and heating ? for an empirical answer we refer to fig [ dsq ] which shows the second invariant of the symmetric stress ( @xmath96 ) and a measure of vorticity @xmath97 plotted in the simulation plane for the pic otv case at the same time as in figure [ jzwap ] .",
    "evidently there is a very high degree of correlation .",

    "mathematically the two effects can be co - located even if they are formally independent because the current sheets are locally quasi - one - dimensional objects .    in this paper",
    "we have discussed the spatio - temporal relationship between current sheets , vorticity and kinetic processes such as proton heating , electron heating and anisotropy . as mentioned above , other quantities ( e.g. density , compressions , localized linear waves , shock(lets ) , pressure dilations )",
    "also may be intermittent and may have strong correlations with current sheets .",
    "a detailed study of such processes is beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "a detailed mathematical study of the relationship between symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the stress tensor is also beyond the scope of this study .",
