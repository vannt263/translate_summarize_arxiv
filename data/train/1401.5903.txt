    "collisionless shocks have been investigated by full particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations for more than four decades since early 1970 s @xcite .",
    "the full pic method handles both electron - scale microphysics and ion - scale shock nonstationarity ( i.e. , spatiotemporal variation ) simultaneously , since both electrons and ions are treated as individual charged particles .",
    "however , smaller simulation systems and reduced parameters ( such as the ion - to - electron mass ratio @xmath1 , the electron plasma - to - cyclotron frequency ratio @xmath2 , and the speed of light relative to the electron thermal velocity ratio @xmath3 ) were used in past simulation studies to save the computational cost .    since early one - dimensional ( 1d ) simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been well known that the shock front at supercritical ( quasi-)perpendicular collisionless shocks becomes nonstationary .",
    "incoming ions are decelerated and accumulated at the shock front .",
    "then , a part of them are reflected upstream periodically .",
    "this coherent behavior of incoming ions results in the periodic collapse and redevelopment of the shock front , which is called the self - reformation .",
    "later , the existence of the reformation in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) system was also confirmed by a full pic simulation @xcite .    it has been known that various types of microinstabilites are generated at the shock foot of perpendicular and quasi - perpendicular shocks during the broadening phase of the shock reformation when",
    "a part of incoming ions are reflected upstream .",
    "the ion reflection results in the deceleration of incoming electrons so that the conservation of the total current ( the zero current condition in the shock normal direction ) is satisfied .",
    "consequently , there arises a relative drift velocity between the incoming electrons and the incoming / reflected ions , which is the free energy source of these microinstabilities .",
    "the ratio of the relative drift velocity to the electron thermal velocity is important for controlling the type of microinstabilities ( or the effect of electron thermal damping to waves ) @xcite .",
    "this ratio is proportional to the ratio of the upstream bulk velocity to the electron thermal velocity .",
    "past self - consistent kinetic simulation studies revealed that there exist various types of microinstabilities in the shock foot region of perpendicular and quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "structures and dynamics of shock waves are generally determined by the following two dimensionless parameters , i.e. , alfven mach number @xmath4 and the plasma beta ( the ratio of the thermal plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the speed of light , bulk velocity , plasma frequency , cyclotron frequency and thermal velocity , respectively , with the subscripts `` @xmath11 '' and `` @xmath12 '' being ion and electron , respectively . here",
    "the subscript `` 1 '' denotes the upstream . from these definitions of the alfven mach number and the electron beta",
    ", we obtain the ratio of the upstream bulk velocity to the electron thermal velocity , which determines the type of microinstabilities in the shock foot region ,",
    "@xmath13 this relation means that the ratio of the upstream bulk velocity to the electron thermal velocity becomes larger with larger alfven mach number , smaller electron beta , or smaller mass ratio .",
    "note that the actual amount of free energy relative to the electron thermal energy ( @xmath14 ) is independent of the mass ratio .",
    "the relative bulk velocity between electrons and ions ( which is proportional to @xmath15 ) controls the type of microinstabilities , while the ratio of the plasma - to - cyclotron frequency ( @xmath2 ) determines the dispersion relation of plasma waves .",
    "when the relative bulk velocity between electrons and ions exceeds the electron thermal velocity , electrostatic waves are excited by current - driven instabilities such as the buneman - type instability ( bi ) @xcite or the electron cyclotron drift instability ( ecdi ) @xcite . at high - mach - number perpendicular shocks ,",
    "the relative velocity between incoming electrons and reflected ions commonly becomes much faster than the electron thermal velocity .",
    "then , the bi becomes dominant , and electrostatic waves are excited at the upper hybrid resonance frequency @xcite . at lower - mach - number ( @xmath16 ) perpendicular shocks ,",
    "the relative velocity between incoming electrons and incoming / reflected ions becomes close to the electron thermal velocity .",
    "then , the growth rate of the bi becomes small because of the damping by thermal electrons , and the ecdi becomes dominant , which excites electrostatic waves at multiple electron cyclotron harmonic frequencies @xcite .",
    "when the relative velocity between incoming electrons and incoming / reflected ions becomes slower than the electron thermal velocity at lower - mach - number perpendicular shocks , high - frequency electrostatic waves are not excited due to the damping by thermal electrons , and the modified two - stream instability ( mtsi ) @xcite becomes dominant .",
    "then , obliquely propagating electromagnetic whistler mode waves are excited at a frequency between the electron cyclotron frequency and the lower hybrid resonance frequency @xcite .",
    "our previous study @xcite has clearly shown that for a relatively low mach number ( @xmath17 ) perpendicular shock the mtsi becomes dominant with higher mass ratios ( @xmath18 ) while the ecdi becomes dominant with smaller mass ratio ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "meanwhile , it has been also known by the early hybrid pic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that large - amplitude fluctuations commonly exist along the shock overshoot in multidimensional systems , which is called as the `` ripples . ''",
    "a typical spatial scale of the shock - front ripples is @xmath20 ion inertial lengths in the shock - tangential direction .",
    "the ripples are thought to involve ( l - mode ) alfven ion cyclotron waves excited by ion temperature anisotropy at the shock front @xcite .",
    "so far , it has been difficult to perform 2d full pic simulations including the shock - front ripples , since current computer resources are not necessarily enough to cover a large simulation domain of several ion inertial lengths in the shock - tangential direction .",
    "development of computer technologies in recent days allows us to perform higher - resolution hybrid 2d pic and larger - scale 2d full pic simulations with a longer simulation time .",
    "recent 2d full pic and hybrid pic simulations of exactly perpendicular shocks @xcite have suggested that the dynamics of collisionless shocks is modified by the ion - to - electron mass ratio .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the reformation is absent with the ion - to - electron mass ratio @xmath21 , while the reformation is suppressed with @xmath22 where the shock reformation is evident in an early phase but becomes apparently suppressed in a later phase .",
    "the difference in the shock dynamics with different mass ratios in the previous studies was discussed in terms of the excitation of `` nonlinear whistler waves '' at the shock front .",
    "our previous study @xcite has confirmed that the mass ratio controls microinstabilities in the shock foot region .",
    "however , the generation of the ripples at the shock front was not included in our previous study , because the system length in the shock - tangential direction was too short .",
    "the purposes of the present study are to perform a large - scale 2d simulation including shock - front ripples for understanding the competition between the ripples and microinstabilities and to make a direct comparison between simulation results with different ion - to - electron mass ratio .",
    "it should be noted that the existence of the shock reformation itself @xcite is not discussed in the present study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the model and the parameters of full pic simulations .",
    "section iii shows the simulation results , and section iv gives conclusion and discussion of the present study .",
    "we use a 2d electromagnetic full particle code in which the full set of maxwell s equations and the relativistic equation of motion for individual electrons and ions are solved in a self - consistent manner . the continuity equation for charge",

    "the upstream magnetic field @xmath49 with a magnitude of @xmath50 is also assumed to be uniform , where @xmath9 is the cyclotron frequency .",

    "the initial condition is given by solving the shock jump conditions ( rankine - hugoniot conditions ) for a magnetized two - fluid isotropic plasma consisting of electrons and ions @xcite . in order to determine a unique initial downstream state ,",

    "it should be noted that a shock wave is excited by the relaxation of the two plasmas with different quantities in the present shock - rest - frame model .",
    "since the initial state is given by the shock jump conditions for a `` two - fluid '' plasma consisting of electrons and ions @xcite , however , the kinetic effect is excluded in the initial state and it is very difficult to construct an exact shock rest frame .",
    "then , the shock front of the excited shock moves upstream at a slow velocity ( @xmath63 ) , as we will show later .",
    "thus , the mach number should be corrected as shown in table 1 .",

    "it is noted that the previous study @xcite with @xmath19 demonstrated that the quasi - periodic oscillation of the shock overshoot gradually disappears when the magnetic field is averaged over the shock tangential direction . however , this fact does not necessarily mean the non - existence of the shock reformation",

    "the spatial profiles of @xmath64 and @xmath79 respectively in panels ( d ) and ( e ) show that there are large - scale ( ion - scale ) waves at the shock front , which correspond to the rippled structure .",
    "the spatial profile of @xmath80 in panel ( f ) shows the excitation of electron - scale electrostatic waves ( at @xmath84 ) .",
    "it is expected that these waves are due to the ecdi generated by a localized ion beam @xcite .",
    "the spatial profiles of @xmath64 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in runs b  d show the excitation of electron - scale electromagnetic waves , which implies oblique whistler waves due to the mtsi @xcite .",
    "the previous linear analysis @xcite has shown that the wavelength of the whistler waves becomes shorter as the mass ratio becomes higher , which is consistent with the present study .",

    "an excellent agreement between the linear analysis and the simulation result was shown . however , since the simulation domain was shorter than the ion inertial length in the shock - tangential direction , shock - front ripples were not included . in the present large - scale simulations , by contrast , since shock front ripples generate an inhomogeneous reflected ion beam @xcite , the standard linear analysis ( in which the spatial distribution of plasma is assumed to be uniform ) is not directly applicable .",
    "however , we use the result of previous linear analysis @xcite as a reference of microinstabilites at the shock foot .    figures 5 , 6 and 7 show the spectral intensity of the electric field @xmath80 component in the shock foot region at different time intervals ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 for a time interval of @xmath98 for fig.5 , @xmath99 and @xmath97 for a time interval of @xmath100 for fig.6 , and @xmath101 and @xmath97 for a time interval of @xmath102 for fig,7 , respectively ) . the @xmath103 spectrum in the top panels and @xmath104 spectrum in the bottom panels are obtained by integrating the @xmath105 spectrum over @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",

    "the @xmath103 spectrum at the quasi - steady phase ( in fig.7 ) shows that the waves are most enhanced at @xmath136 and @xmath139 for @xmath31 625 and 256 ( @xmath140 0.25 and 0.4 for @xmath31 625 and 256 , respectively ) .",
    "these characteristics are very similar to the `` nonlinear whistler waves '' seen in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "however , the generation mechanism of the nonlinear whistler waves is still unclear .",
    "although hellinger _",
    "@xcite proposed a fluid - like nonlinear three - wave coupling , it is difficult to identify this process in the present study . as hellinger _",
    "_ @xcite denied the direct generation by the beam of reflected ions ( i.e. , mtsi-2 ) , reflected ions are strongly scattered in the velocity space at the shock foot near the shock ramp , possibly by the nonlinear whistler waves , and the beam of reflected ions no longer exists for higher - mass - ratio runs in the present study . here , we suggest the importance of the waves propagating downstream at the shock foot . as seen in the phase - space plots for higher - mass - ratio runs ( fig.2(a ) ) , incoming ions are modulated and reflected ions are strongly scattered in the velocity space at the shock foot near the shock ramp .",
    "an alternative generation mechanism suggested in the present study is a kinetic wave - wave interaction in the phase space : the merging between phase - space vortices of large - amplitude ( nonlinear ) waves propagating upstream and downstream ( generated by the mtsi-2 and mtsi-1 , respectively ) , which may generate a large - amplitude phase - space vortices which is almost at rest in the shock frame . in order to confirm this process ,",
    "however , a further investigation is required .",
    "also , the issue of the absence / existence of the shock reformation discussed in the previous studies @xcite is not addressed in the present study .",
    "this is because averaging the magnetic field over the shock tangential direction does not necessarily show the existence / absence of the shock reformation .",
    "meanwhile , it is very difficult to define the shock reformation in multidimensional systems only from a local magnetic field @xcite . here",
    ", we again suggest the importance of the waves propagating downstream at the shock foot .",
    "the waves generated by microinstabilities ( mtsis ) have an electron - scale wavelength in the shock normal direction but an ion - scale wavelength in the shock tangential direction .",
    "hence , it is possible that the waves propagating downstream generated by the mtsi-1 interact with the l - mode alfven cyclotron waves at the shock overshoot , which may result in the modification in the development of shock front ripples at the transition phase .",
    "although this issue needs further parameter surveys for various alfven mach numbers and various plasma beta which should be left as a future study , the present result has indicated that microinstabilities play a role in the modification of collisionless shock dynamics among different ion - to - electron mass ratio .",
