    "<S> the formation of unstaggered localized modes in dynamical lattices can be supported by the interplay of discreteness and nonlinearity with a finite relaxation time . in rapidly responding nonlinear media , on - site discrete solitons are stable , and their broad inter - site counterparts are marginally stable , featuring a virtually vanishing real instability eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> the solitons become unstable in the case of the slowly relaxing nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> the character of the instability alters with the increase of the delay time , which leads to a change in the dynamics of unstable discrete solitons . </S>",
    "<S> they form robust localized breathers in rapidly relaxing media , and decay into oscillatory diffractive pattern in the lattices with a slow nonlinear response . </S>",
    "<S> marginally stable solitons can freely move across the lattice .    * </S>",
    "<S> the delay of the medium s response is unavoidable in natural phenomena and technology . in this respect , it is relevant to mention the cellular physiology , genetics , signal processing , transport of impulses through neural networks , the propagation of light signals in optical resonator systems and cavities , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> the delayed response may significantly affect many phenomena in these fields . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , essential issues , which are addressed in this paper , are the existence , stability and dynamics of localized modes in dynamical lattices with the non - instantaneous nonlinear response . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice , which may describe an array of nonlinear optical waveguides , is modeled by the time - delayed discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the localized modes in this model are explored using a properly modified delay - differential equation solver package dde - biftool v. 2.00 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the discrete bright on - site and inter - site solitons ( so classified according to the location of their center ) can be created by the modulational instability of continuous waves , which occurs in the same parameter region as in the lattice with the instantaneous nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the stability of the solitons is affected by the delayed response in three different ways : ( i ) the solitons are destroyed when the delay time exceeds a certain critical value ; ( ii ) in the case of the fast nonlinear response ( short temporal delay ) , the instability growth rate of inter - site solitons decreases in comparison with the instantaneous model ; ( iii ) the instability type changes for intermediate values of the delay time . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - site and on - site solitons with very close values of the power in the fast - responding media evolve into localized breathing modes when their amplitude is slightly perturbed . </S>",
    "<S> they can also be transformed into moving localized modes by the application of a kick . </S>",
    "<S> however , larger values of the delay time enhance the temporal correlation between time - distant events , which results in bringing moving solitons to a halt . * </S>"
