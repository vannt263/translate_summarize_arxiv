    "water spectra can be observed from many different regimes in the universe , several of which are discussed further below .",
    "the spectrum of water , particularly at elevated temperatures , is rich and complex .",
    "a few years ago @xcite presented a comprehensive line list , known as bt2 , which used well - established theoretical procedures to compute all the transitions of h@xmath0@xmath3o  of importance in objects with temperatures up to 3000 k. bt2 contains about 500 million lines .",
    "a similar line list for hd@xmath3o , known as vtt , was subsequently computed by @xcite .",
    "the bt2 line list has been extensively used .",
    "it forms the basis of the most recent release of the hitemp high - temperature spectroscopic database @xcite and for the bt - settl model @xcite for stellar and substellar atmospheres covering the range from solar - mass stars to the latest - type t and y dwarfs .",
    "bt2 has been used to detect and analyse water spectra in objects as diverse as the nova - like object v838 mon @xcite , atmospheres of brown dwarfs @xcite and m subdwarfs @xcite , and extensively for exoplanets @xcite . within the solar system bt2",
    "has been used to show an imbalance between nuclear spin and rotational temperatures in cometary comae @xcite and assign a new set of , as yet unexplained , high energy water emissions in comets @xcite , as well as to model water spectra in the deep atmosphere of venus @xcite .",
    "although bt2 was developed for astrophysical use , it has been applied to a variety of other problems including the calculation of the refractive index of humid air in the infrared @xcite , high speed thermometry and tomographic imaging in gas engines and burners @xcite , as the basis for an improved theory of line - broadening @xcite , and to validate the data used in models of the earths atmosphere and in particular simulating the contribution of weak water transitions to the so - called water continuum @xcite .",
    "there are several water line lists published in the literature @xcite .",
    "two linelists have also been computed specifically for the isotopologues : @xcite created the 3mol room - temperature line lists for h@xmath0@xmath3o , h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  based on the pes of @xcite ; tashkun created a number of line lists based on the work of @xcite , see @xcite .",
    "these are considered further below .    at present hot line lists",
    "are only published for h@xmath0@xmath3o  and hd@xmath3o .",
    "however isotopically - substituted water containing @xmath1o or @xmath2o provides important markers for a variety of astronomical problems @xcite .",
    "for example @xcite recently detected h@xmath0@xmath1o  in the emission - line spectrum of the luminous m - supergiant vy cma .",
    "astronomical spectra of water isotopologues @xcite and their direct analysis in cometary dust particles @xcite and carbonaceous chrondrites @xcite have been used to determine formation mechanisms and constrain formation models .",
    "water isotope ratios are also used to monitor stellar evolution @xcite and to probe the atmosphere of mars @xcite .",
    "the seemingly minor isotopologues of water can be important species in their own right with , for example , h@xmath0@xmath1obeing the fifth largest absorber of sunlight the earth s atmosphere .",
    "there is therefore a need for line lists equivalent to bt2 for h@xmath0@xmath2oand h@xmath0@xmath1o  to aid spectroscopic studies , and it is these that are presented here .",
    "these lists form part of the exomol project @xcite which aims to provide a comprehensive set of molecular line lists for studies of molecular line lists for exoplanet and other hot atmospheres .",
    "although our new line lists in some way mimic bt2 , they also take advantage of a number of recent theoretical developments . in particular a iupac task group @xcite used a systematic procedure @xcite to derive empirical energy levels for all the main isotopologues of water @xcite .",
    "these levels are combined with a newly - developed procedure for enhancing the accuracy of calculations on isotopically substituted species , which is used for the first time here .",
    "this ensures that most of the key frequencies in our new line lists are determined with an accuracy close to experimental , even though many of them are yet to be observed .",
    "furthermore , theoretical work on improving the accuracy and representation of the water dipole moment @xcite has improved the accuracy with which water transition intensities are predicted @xcite .",
    "some of these advances have already been used to create improved room temperature line lists for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  @xcite which were included in their entirety in the 2012 release of hitran @xcite .    the paper is structured as follows : section 2 outlines our overall methodology and presents the derivation of potential energy surfaces ( pes ) .",
    "the details of the calculation of the new line lists , along with comparison with previous line lists , are given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 discusses further improvement of the line list by the substitution of calculated energy levels with empirical ones , together with the procedure used to label energy levels with approximate vibrational and rotational quantum numbers .",
    "our results are discussed in section 5 .",
    "the fitting of water ( h@xmath0@xmath3o ) pess to experimental spectroscopic data has a long history .",
    "the first fitted pes giving near to experimental accuracy was pjt1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite constructed a fitted pes starting from a highly accurate _",
    "ab initio _",
    "calculation ; all subsequent water potentials followed this procedure and have been based on _ ab initio _  studies of increasing sophistication . as a result",
    "there are several very good water pess available @xcite .    here",
    "we need a pes which satisfies two criteria .",
    "first , it should be at least as accurate as the pes used for the bt2 line list with the calculated energies ranging up to 30 000 @xmath5 .",
    "second , the pes should be adapted to the calculation of energy levels of the two water isotopologues h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o .",
    "this second requirement is harder to fulfill , as the characterisation of the experimental energy levels of both h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  is significantly less extensive than for h@xmath0@xmath3o@xcite .    to take advantage of the accumulated knowledge on the spectrum",
    "h@xmath0@xmath3oin constructing a pes for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  and following previous work @xcite , we decided to fit a born - oppenheimer ( bo ) mass - independent pes to the available data for h@xmath0@xmath3o  and fix the adiabatic bo diagonal correction ( bodc ) , mass - dependent surface to the _ ab initio _",
    "value of @xcite .",
    "obviously this procedure requires the accuracy of predictions for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1oto be verified .",
    "this is done by comparing the calculated h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1oenergy levels to the available experimentally - determined ones @xcite .",
    "we used the same fitting procedure as @xcite .",
    "nuclear motion calculations were performed with dvr3d @xcite .",
    "as elsewhere , in the fit the experimentally derived energies of h@xmath0@xmath3ofor the @xmath6 and 5 rotational states by @xcite were used .    in the following our new empirical pes obtained using the fitting procedure described above",
    "will be referenced to as pes1 , while the pes by @xcite will be referenced to as pes2 .",
    "tables  [ pes17 ] and [ pes18 ] present a comparison between the @xmath7 energy levels calculated using pes1 , pes2 for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1orespectively . for comparison as a third column we present the @xmath8 levels and corresponding discrepancies using the pes ( called pes3 in the tables ) due to @xcite taken from the linelist calculated by dr .",
    "tashkun and summarised by @xcite .",
    "the line list based on pes3 was calculated for three temperatures : t=296 k , 1000 k and 3000 k. for all versions the highest value of the rotational quantum number @xmath9 considered is 28 and the spectral range is 0 - 28500 @xmath5 .",
    "the number of lines for h@xmath0@xmath1o  is 108  784 and for h@xmath0@xmath2o  109  083 .",
    "indeed , one can see that the agreement with the experiment is very good .",
    "although the results obtained using pes2 are somewhat better than those for pes1 .",
    "however employing pes1 gives us the opportunity to use the information on h@xmath0@xmath3o  experimental energy levels to predict very accurately energy levels of h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o .",
    "we call these predicted levels pseudo - experimental energies for the reasons explained below",
    ". table  [ sd ] illustrates the unprecedented accuracy of the prediction of the h@xmath0@xmath2o  energy levels for those states whose energies are known experimentally .",
    "the slightly less good , but still very accurate , energy levels predicted for h@xmath0@xmath1o  are shown in the column 2 of table  [ sd ] .",
    "we might expect a similar level of accuracy for predictions of the h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  energy levels for states yet to be measured for these isotopologues , but known for h@xmath0@xmath3o .",
    "we note that the standard deviations given in table  [ sd ] are rather systematic suggesting that further improvement in the predictions may be possible .",
    "this and details of our final pseudo - experimental energy levels are discussed in section 4 .",
    ".comparison of calculated @xmath10 term values for h@xmath0@xmath2ousing three potentials with experimental data .",
    "experimental ( obs ) data is taken from @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath11 : upper state counting number .",
    "+ @xmath12 : lower state counting number .",
    "+ @xmath13 : einstein - a coefficient in s@xmath14 .",
    "+    the states file lists all the ro - vibrational levels for each @xmath9 and for four c@xmath15 symmetries .",
    "it is common to further label the every level with ( approximate ) vibrational quantum numbers @xmath16 which correspond to the symmetric stretch , bending and asymmetric stretch modes , respectively and the rotational levels within each vibrational state by @xmath17 , where again the projection quantum numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 are approximate .",
    "dvr3d does not provide these approximate labels but there are several methods available for labeling water energy levels @xcite . here",
    "we label levels with @xmath20 and energies below 20  000 @xmath5 .",
    "as our energy levels differ by less than 1 @xmath5  from those of @xcite , transferring the labels from this previous study proved to be straightforward .",
    "we note that the labels we use are based on the normal modes from a harmonic oscillator model .",
    "it is well know that the higher stretching states of water are better represented with a local - mode model @xcite .",
    "however , there is a one - to - one correspodance between the two labelling schemes @xcite ; the use of normal mode labels are used for simplicity .",
    "the accuracy of the present line lists can be established by the comparison with the previous line lists calculations .",
    "two types of comparison could be made .",
    "the overall picture for the high temperature is that the coverage the hotwat78 h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  line lists should be very similar to bt2 , but that both the predicted intensives and the line positions should be significantly better .",
    "furthermore lines may shift by between a few @xmath5  to a few tens of @xmath5  between isotopologues .",
    "figure 1 demonstrate that , as expected , the overall picture is very similar for bt2 ( h@xmath0@xmath3o ) and hotwat78 ( h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o ) .",
    "here we provide the comparison only for h@xmath0@xmath1o but for the h@xmath0@xmath2o  it looks the same .",
    "figures 2 and 3 illustrate the similarity of the hotwat78 line lists with the previous high accuracy h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  line lists ( called 3mol ) of @xcite for these molecules at the room temperature .",
    "figures 4 and 5 also provide a comparison with the hitran data for the room temperature for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o .",
    "these figures only provide an overview , but a detailed line by line comparison confirms that all the calculations we present here are done correctly .",
    "the present line lists are significantly more complete , but this is only apparant at higher temperatures , see fig .",
    "3 . for the room temperature",
    "the previous line lists should look similar , as they indeed do , see figures 2 .",
    "this paper reports hot line lists for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o .",
    "these line lists represent significant improvement on both coverage and accuracy of the previous h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  line lists @xcite .",
    "the predicted frequencies in these line lists have been significantly improved using information obtained from the corresponding h@xmath0@xmath3o  empirical energy levels .",
    "this procedure can be adapted to give improved predictions of energy levels and transition frequencies for isotopologues of molecules for whom the empirical energy levels of the parent molecule are well - known .",
    "the complete hotwat78 line lists for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  can be downloaded from the cds , via ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/j/mnras/ , or via http://cdsarc.u - strasbg.fr / viz - bin / qcat?j / mnras/. the line lists together with auxiliary data including the potential parameters , dipole moment functions , and theoretical energy levels can be also obtained at www.exomol.com , where they form part of the enhanced exomol database @xcite .",
    "the bt2 h@xmath0@xmath3o  line list @xcite is already available from these sources .",
    "finally we note that pressure - broadening has been shown to have a significant effect on water spectra in exoplanets @xcite .",
    "exomol , in common with other databases , assumes that pressure - broadening parameters for h@xmath0@xmath2o  and h@xmath0@xmath1o  are the same as those for h@xmath0@xmath3o .",
    "this assumption is built into the recently updated structure of the exomol database @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently presented a comprehensive set of pressure - broadening parameters for h@xmath0@xmath3o  lines which form the basis for the exomol pressure - broadening diet for water @xcite .",
    "these parameters , which are available on the exomol website , are also suitable for use with the hotwat78 line lists .",
    "this work is supported by erc advanced investigator project 267219 and by the russian fund for fundamental studies .",
