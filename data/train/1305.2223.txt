    "bg  gem is a 13mag stellar object that shows brightness variations with a period of 91.645 days and an amplitude of @xmath3 0.5 mag at visible wavelengths ( benson et al .",
    "the primary eclipse is only observed at @xmath4 4400 , while the light curves are shallower at longer wavelengths . from low - resolution ( @xmath36  ) observations of the system ,",
    "kenyon , groot , & benson ( 2002 ) deduced that the optical spectrum is dominated by absorption lines from a k0  i secondary component .",
    "they suggested that line emission which occurs in the balmer and some hei lines may originate from a b  type or a black hole primary component . from the radial velocity curve , they determined a components mass ratio of 0.22@xmath50.07 .",
    "elebert et al .",
    "( 2007 ) took a high - resolution optical spectrum , retrieved an archival uv spectrum obtained with hst , and found an upper limit for the x - ray flux from integral .",
    "they detected a weak uv continuum ( more indicative of a black hole than of a normal star ) , but a low x - ray luminosity ( @xmath6 ergs@xmath2 ) and a low rotational velocity of the disk material ( 500 kms@xmath2 in the balmer lines and @xmath7 1000 kms@xmath2 in the uv emission lines ) .",
    "therefore , these findings are inconclusive . however",
    ", if bg  gem does have a black hole component , it becomes the longest - period system of this kind in the milky way .",
    "open questions in studies of this system include the poorly known fundamental parameters of the cool secondary companion , the unknown nature of the primary component , and the evolutionary status of the entire system .",
    "in order to refine the secondary component parameters as well as those of the entire system and check the light curve , we took new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the bg  gem system .",
    "the photometric data were obtained in the @xmath8 filters during 11  nights in 20052006 at the 0.81m telescope of the three college observatory near greensboro , north carolina , usa . the main goal of these observations was to look for changes of the light curves compared to the published data . *",
    "our data show the same brightness level at covered phases , but they are insufficient to detect any possible change of the orbital period .",
    "*    a high  resolution chelle spectrum ( @xmath9 480010500   , @xmath10 = 60000 ) was obtained at the 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope of the mcdonald observatory in december 2006 . the spectrum was taken at an orbital phase of 0.62 ( from the primary minimum ) .",
    "it has a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath330 in continuum near @xmath114800   that rises towards longer wavelengths reaching @xmath3100 near @xmath111 @xmath12 m .",
    "parts of the spectrum are shown in figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .     to match the line widths of bg  gem .",
    "the spectrum of bg  gem resembles the spectrum of hd  19745 except for the lii line at @xmath13    which is absent in the spectrum of bg  gem.,width=377 ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "significant rotational broadening of the lines in the spectrum of bg  gem , an insufficient s / n ratio , and veiling of the spectrum caused by the primary s accretion disk emission make it difficult to measure equivalent widths of individual fei and feii lines and perform the usual analysis based on excitation and ionization equilibrium .    to derive the atmospheric parameters of bg  gem , we compared its spectrum with those of various k  type giant and supergiant stars with well - known parameters .",
    "we broadened lines in these spectra to the rotation velocity of bg  gem .",
    "projected rotation velocity of bg  gem was determined by means of fitting the observed spectrum with synthetic spectra , calculated with different values of rotation velocity .",
    "taking into account the fwhm of the instrumental profile of the spectrograph and adopting a macroturbulent velocity of 2  kms@xmath2 , we determined a rotation velocity of @xmath14  kms@xmath2 for bg  gem .    using these parameters , we calculated a grid of synthetic spectra in a wide range of effective temperatures and surface gravities ( @xmath15 ) in the spectral region @xmath16  containing lines of neutral elements with different excitation potentials and two lines of feii ( at @xmath17  and @xmath18   ) which are sensitive to surface gravity .",
    "synthetic spectra were calculated using the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1993 ) and the current version ( august 2010 ) of the spectral analysis code moog ( sneden 1973 ) .",
    "the solar abundances taken from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) were adopted except the carbon and nitrogen abundances , which are known to be modified in giant stars ( see , e.g. , lambert & ries 1981 ) .",
    "the vald atomic data base ( kupka et al . 1999 ) was used to create the line list .",
    "a microturbulent velocity of 2.0  kms@xmath2 was adopted in our synthetic spectra calculations .",
    "an additional flux of 30% in continuum ( @xmath19 ) was added to the synthetic spectra .    as an example , in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we show a comparison of the observed and synthetic spectra calculated with @xmath20  k and different values of @xmath21 ( from 0.8 to 2.4 ) in two spectral regions containing feii lines at @xmath17    and @xmath18    used to estimate the surface gravity .    among high - rotating k giants with infrared excesses ,",
    "nearly half have a high li abundance ( drake et al .",
    "such an abundance was found by gonzlez hernndez et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the secondary component in the black hole binary a062000 and by sabbi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in the companion star to the millisecond pulsar j17405340 in ngc  6397 suggesting some li production in these systems .",
    "we calculated synthetic spectra in the region of the lii 6708    resonance line and found a low li abundance in bg  gem , @xmath22 ( in the notation @xmath23 .",
    "analysis of the absorption line spectrum shows that the secondary component is a k2  ii / iii star with a projected rotational velocity of 18@xmath24  kms@xmath2 , an effective temperature of 4500@xmath5300  k , and a surface gravity @xmath21 = 1.5@xmath50.5 .",
    "the derived surface gravity implies a mass of the secondary component of 1@xmath25 , if it is filling its roche lobe .",
    "diffuse interstellar bands are weak implying a noticeable contribution of the primary s disk to the near - ir excess . assuming an interstellar extinction of @xmath26 = 1.5  mag and @xmath27  mag for the k2giant , the system is located at a distance of at least 3.5  kpc ( no disk contribution at its eclipse by the secondary ) .",
    "no features that could be a result of an explosion in the system due to formation of the black hole are seen in the _ wise _ data between @xmath113.4 and @xmath1111.5 @xmath12 m .",
    "we refined the fundamental parameters of the visible star in the bg  gem binary system and showed that it is a rapidly rotating k2  ii / iii star rather than a k0  i star suggested by benson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and kenyon et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "it is still unclear whether a black hole is present in the system .",
    "the fact that we detect no light from a hot star implies that the primary s disk completely veils it .",
    "spectroscopic observations at both eclipses are needed to put further constraints on the system properties .",
