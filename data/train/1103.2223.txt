    "during the last decade , the field of superconducting qubits has advanced tremendously @xcite .",
    "these systems behave quantum - mechanically , and can be regarded as tunable artificial atoms .",
    "different from their natural counterparts , they couple strongly with the environment and as a result they have shorter coherence times . on the other hand ,",
    "stronger coupling has its own advantages , such as easier addressability and shorter gate times .",
    "a number of quantum phenomena become manifest when atoms interact with electromagnetic radiation . among these ,",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency in atomic media allows spectacular effects such as the reduction of the group velocity of light to a few meters per second @xcite or even a complete stop .",
    "this phenomenon requires two fields ( the `` probe '' and the `` coupling '' - or `` pump''- field ) and a three - level atom .",
    "the two fields are typically on - resonance ( or not far off - resonance ) from the two transitions .",
    "this effect can be used for coherent storage of optical information @xcite , for the realization of quantum repeaters @xcite , for enhanced photon - photon interactions @xcite , and for setting up table - top cosmological experiments such as the creation of event horizons @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are not restricted to atomic physics , but solid - state systems can also be used : for example , ultraslow light propagation has been already demonstrated in crystals @xcite .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency has its roots in the destructive interference of probability amplitudes of the state that is coupled to both fields : as a result , the `` probe '' field is no longer absorbed and the atom becomes `` trapped '' in a `` dark '' state ( a superposition formed by the other two states ) , a phenomenon called `` coherent population trapping '' .",
    "this phenomenon could find applications as a way to precisely prepare initial states in future quantum computers .",
    "in solid - state systems , this effect has so far been demonstrated with donor - bound spins in gaas @xcite , with nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond @xcite , and with single spins in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "superconducting quantum circuits can be operated as well as three - level systems interacting with two radiation fields on - resonant with the two transitions .",
    "so far , this has been realized with phase qubits @xcite , transmons @xcite , and flux qubits @xcite . from the spectra",
    "obtained in these experiments it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between electromagnetically induced transparency ( whose origin is quantum interference ) and the autler - townes effect @xcite ( which is due to the shift of the resonance of the transition frequency which is probed ) . as a rule of thumb to separate the two effects@xcite ,",
    "if the coupling - field rabi frequency ( denoted by @xmath0 in this paper ) is much smaller than the spectral linewidth of the darkened transition and in absorption spectroscopy we see a sharp dip formed within the linewidth , then we have electromagnetically induced transparency . if the rabi frequency of the coupling field is much larger then the linewidth , we have the autler - townes effect , which appears as the splitting of the spectral line into two lines of width similar to the initial one and separated by @xmath1 .",
    "evidence for coherent population trapping and electromagnetically induced transparency is so far only indirect : there is yet no quantum tomography experiment performed to truly measure the superposition mentioned above ( see the previous paragraph ) . in the experiment of ref . [ ] analyzed in this paper the power of the coupling field is such that @xmath0 is larger than the linewidth , making the second effect dominant .",
    "we will therefore refer to the phenomenon described below as the autler - townes effect in a superconducting qubit .",
    "we consider here a phase qubit : a system consisting of a superconducting loop interrupted by a josephson junction @xcite .",
    "the three lowest energy levels are denoted by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , and the corresponding transitions can be driven@xcite by microwave radiation fields with frequencies of the order of a few gigahertz . in atomic physics",
    "@xcite , the states typically form a @xmath5 configuration , with @xmath2 and @xmath4 being metastable hyperfine or zeeman levels , while the state @xmath3 is usually an excited electronic state that decays at a faster rate .",
    "the situation in the case of phase qubits differs : since the direct transition @xmath6 is suppressed in these systems due to relatively low anharmonicity , the most straightforward operation of the phase qubits is as ladder systems , that is , driving only on the allowed single - photon transitions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is also possible to operate these systems in the @xmath5 configuration @xcite , by driving two - photon virtual transitions from @xmath2 to @xmath4 with an intense microwave field at the frequency @xmath9 .",
    "this frequency can be sufficiently detuned from the transition @xmath10 that the direct excitation into the state @xmath3 is small .",
    "depending on the sample design , one can measure either the level population of the qubit ( if it can be addressed directly ) , or the scattered radiation .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "[ ] the qubit is embedded in a one - dimensional transmission line , and what has been measured is the absorption of a probe microwave signal in resonance with the @xmath11 transition .",
    "what is seen is that this quantity becomes large ( close to 1 within a few percentage points ) when a more intense field is applied to the transition @xmath12 .",
    "future quantum - information processing devices based on superconducting circuit architectures could make use of microwave - controlled states in three - level systems .",
    "in addition to the applications listed above , specific to the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics one could employ three - level effects for the coherent and tunable excitation of microwaves in coplanar waveguides @xcite , as an alternative way to measure the qubit s decoherence rates @xcite , for cooling @xcite and single - photon generation @xcite , as a single - atom media quantum amplifier @xcite , and as quantum switches @xcite .    this work is organized as follows : in section [ multi_level ] we introduce the phase qubit and derive its corresponding hamiltonian . in section [ master_eq ]",
    "we write the general form of the lindblad master equation for the phase qubit approximated as a three - level system , including relaxation and dephasing in our model .",
    "a full derivation of the relaxation term and of the dephasing term can be found in appendices [ appendixa ] and [ appendixb ] , respectively .",
    "the three - level model can be easily extended to account for spurious excitations on the next two levels , and the resulting five - level model is briefly presented in section [ 5levels ] . in section [ dephasing ] we then explain how to extract the dephasing rates corresponding to the three levels from the occupation probabilities under continuous irradiation ( the relaxation rates are obtained from independent pulsed measurements ) .",
    "next , we present a number of approximate analytical results ( section [ analytical ] ) for the autler - townes splitting and for the occupation probabilities . in section [ comparison ]",
    "we present the experimental data for the autler - townes effect and we compare them with the theoretical predictions based on the parameters determined in section [ dephasing ] . we show that the approximate analytical results presented in section [ analytical ] provide a good fit to the data .",
    "better agreement can be obtained with numerical simulations for the full five - level model of section [ 5levels ] .",
    "finally , in section [ dark ] we calculate the fidelities of the steady states relative to ideal dark states .",
    "details about the structure of the steady states are delegated to appendix [ appendixc ] .",
    "in this section we introduce our phase qubit @xcite , and analyze it theoretically in the three - level approximation .",
