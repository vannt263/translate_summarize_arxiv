    "consider a gravitational system composed of a central star , several planets on relatively tight orbits , and a perturbing body at a large semimajor axis .",
    "any inclination of the outermost orbit relative to the inner ones would produce a long term precession of the planet orbital planes .",

    "the goal of the present study is to determine the full range of spin - orbit angle that can be generated by the secular precession motion described above . by definition ,",

    "* bou & fabrycky ( 2014 ) ) . here , the method is applied to 55 cancri , a 5 planet system in a stellar binary .",
    "this work is motivated by a recent measurement of the projected spin - orbit angle of 55 cancri performed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bourrier & hbrard ( 2014 ) ) using the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",

    "the configuration of the system is uniquely defined by three unit vectors @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 along the angular momentum of the stellar rotation , of the planet orbital motion , and of the companion s orbit , respectively .",
    "their motion is governed by the following secular equations ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "these frequencies represent the speed at which each vector precesses around the others .",
    "the interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is due to the oblateness of the central star induced by its rotation .",
    "a similar interaction should exist between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , but given its weakness , it is neglected .",
    "the system described by the differential equations ( [ eq.motion ] ) belongs to a class of integrable three vector problems ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bou & laskar 2006 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "the general solution is a uniform rotation of the three vectors around the total angular momentum combined with periodic loops in the rotating frame ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .    ) seen in a fixed reference frame ( left ) and in a rotating frame ( right ) .",
    "the total angular momentum is aligned with the @xmath10-axis.,width=326 ]",
    "in the specific case where the perturber is a star , the binary s orbit possesses most of the total angular momentum . by consequence ,",
    "its plane is practically invariant and the precession frequency @xmath9 is negligible with respect to the other frequencies .",
    "furthermore , if we discard the timescale of the evolution , the three remaining frequencies can be normalized by an arbitrary constant so that the effective dimension of the parameter space becomes equal to two .",
    "using barycentric coordinates @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , all systems with identical spin - orbit behavior but different timescales can be represented by a single point in a ternary diagram ( figures [ fig2 ] and 3 ) .    .",
    "the system 55 cancri is represented by a segment corresponding to the binary eccentricity ranging from 0 ( top left end ) to 0.95 ( bottom right end ) .",
    "any position in this diagram uniquely determines the behavior of the stellar obliquity .",
    "this value increases from a few degrees at the @xmath6-@xmath7 edge up to twice the initial inclination of the binary s orbit at the @xmath8 vertex of the triangle .",
    "five insets detail the obliquity s full amplitude ( vertical axis , in degrees ) as a function of the binary s initial inclination ( hortizontal axis , in degrees ) , the maximum of which is shown as level curves across the diagram . ]    in this diagram , close to the upper corner , as in the 55 cancri case , the frequency @xmath6 is the highest , thus the evolution is dominated by the precession of the central star around the planet plane . near",
    "the bottom left vertex , the strongest motion is the precession of the planets with respect to the equator of the star at the frequency @xmath7 .",
    "finally , in the vicinity of the bottom right corner where @xmath8 dominates , the evolution is mainly characterized by the precession of the planets around the binary s orbital plane .    as a result , all systems in the neighborhood of the @xmath6-@xmath7 edge are lead by a strong coupling between the central star and the planets .",
    "hence , if the spin - orbit angle is initially small , it remains small .",
    "conversely , close to the @xmath8 vertex the precession of the planets around the binary s orbit is too fast for the star to follow , thus the obliquity increases up to twice the initial inclination of the binary .",
    "the middle of the @xmath6-@xmath8 edge is particular because it corresponds to a secular spin - orbit resonance in the vicinity of a cassini state . in this case",

    "were forced to zero and the system was artificially shifted at the @xmath8 corner in figure [ fig2 ] .    in order to match the rossiter - mclaughlin observations , it is necessary to enhance the coupling between the planets and the companion .",
    "one solution is to increase the eccentricity of the binary above @xmath14 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bou & fabrycky 2014 ) ) . with this value ,",
    "the system reaches the cassini regime ( middle of the @xmath6-@xmath8 edge in figure [ fig2 ] ) and the obliquity can grow by a large amount .",
    "= 150    another solution is to assume that planet d is the actual perturber of the inner four planets .",
