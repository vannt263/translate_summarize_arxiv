    "once we have the ability to control electronic heat currents with ndtc , it is natural to exploit it in order to realize a thermal transistor . similarly to its electronic analogue , the thermal transistor consists of three terminals : the source , the drain and the gate , residing at temperatures @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "the last terminal is a control knob that can tune the thermal flow across the device , offering also the opportunity to obtain _",
    "heat amplification_. this is possible if the changes in the thermal current coming form the gate ( @xmath168 ) can induce an even larger change in the currents flowing from the source to the drain.@xcite    in order to envision the potential working operations of the transistor , we shall study two possible configurations of a three - terminal hybrid device . as shown in fig .",

    "we will show that this structure can act as a thermal _ switch _ and _ modulator_. on the other hand , if we connect a n gate to a s@xmath13is@xmath2 in chain , we can obtain a thermal amplifier , as explained in the next section .    for simplicity , we set a fixed temperature gradient across the device , i.e. @xmath183 , and we assume that the device does not release energy to the environment . the latter hypothesis results to be accurate at low temperatures and for small volumes of the electrodes .",
    "then , we analyze the behavior of the heat currents flowing out of the source and entering the drain ( @xmath175 and @xmath167 , respectively ) when we vary @xmath169 .",
    "this is obtained by solving the following energy - balance equation : @xmath184 where @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , while @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the normal - state resistances of the tunnel junctions connecting the central island to the other terminals of the device .",
    "the results for @xmath107 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , where we set @xmath170 k , @xmath171 mk , @xmath9 , @xmath172 k@xmath15 , @xmath173 k@xmath15 and @xmath174 k@xmath15 .",

    "[ fig6](b ) ] .",
    "these points can represent 1 and 0 boolean states and do not depend on the history of the device .",
    "therefore , our structure can work as a thermal switch .    additionally , this system can operate as a thermal modulator , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) for the same parameters listed above except for @xmath177 k@xmath15 and @xmath194 .",
    "the latter value has been chosen to suppress the thermal hysteresis [ see sect .  [ sect5 ] ] and simplify the following analysis on heat amplification . as a matter of fact , even at a first glance , it is possible to note that the device can remarkably reduce @xmath175 and @xmath167 in a region where @xmath168 remains close to zero [ see region i in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ] .",
    "this behavior can be evaluated more quantitatively by defining the amplification factor:@xcite @xmath195 where we used eq .   and defined @xmath196 and @xmath197 as the differential thermal conductances of the source and drain tunnel junctions . from eq .",

    "the source is connected to the central island by means of the nis@xmath13 junction , which can not show the ndtc effect and",
    "therefore we always have @xmath201 . instead",
    ", the s@xmath13is@xmath2 junction can generate @xmath202 , as demonstrated in the previous sections .",
    "the trend for @xmath203 and @xmath204 vs. @xmath169 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) , where we can immediately distinguish two amplification regions i and ii , shadowed in blue and yellow , respectively . in region",
    "i , i.e. for @xmath205k@xmath206k , the performance of the thermal modulator is ideal and both the amplification factors are @xmath207 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) , this corresponds to the regime characterized by : @xmath208 where the identity between the first two sides has been obtained by using eq .  .",
    "moreover , we have : @xmath209 since @xmath201 and @xmath210 is negative in the whole range of operation [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ] . thus , from eq .",
    "we obtain that region i is characterized by @xmath211 and @xmath212 . yet , in the whole extension of region ii , i.e. @xmath213k@xmath214k , the presence of the ndtc ( @xmath202 ) still produces @xmath215 , even though @xmath168 increases with a finite slope [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ] .",
    "this configuration would produce significant results also in a more realistic device that can release energy to the environment .",
    "as explained in the previous section , a n cold finger connected to s@xmath2 would be able to maintain a relevant temperature gradient at the output of the transistor , leading to differences between the 1 and 0 states of the thermal switch exceeding 10 mk .",

    "[ fig7](a ) and consists of two n electrodes acting as the gate and the drain , while s@xmath13 and s@xmath2 embody the source and the central island , respectively .",
    "if we take the same assumptions described in the previous section , we can calculate @xmath175 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 vs. @xmath169 , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ( see the caption for the detailed list of parameters ) .",
    "it is easy to observe that the electronic heat current curves present a very small region of thermal hysteresis , which can not be used to realize an effective thermal switch . as anticipated in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] , the effect is indeed reduced with respect to that observed in previous devices , since in this case the ndtc is obtained by varying @xmath4 instead of @xmath3 and is consequently much more localized in the proximity of the smp .",
    "nevertheless , if we consider a higher value of @xmath108 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) ] , we can easily appreciate the amplification effect of our device .",
    "as we have noticed in the previous case , two different regimes i and ii are visible [ see fig .  [ fig7](d ) ] : in region ii , only @xmath204 is raised above 1 by the ndtc , while in region i @xmath221 and both @xmath212 .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the transport properties of a temperature - biased jj composed by two different superconductors . from the point of view of charge transport",
    ", this s@xmath13is@xmath2 junction can support a josephson current , which present a remarkable jump when @xmath63 .",
    "this feature has never been observed so far and would confirm the microscopic theory for a josephson tunneling structure.@xcite moreover , the temperature - dependence of the josephson current could provide a valid alternative to probe the electronic temperature in superconducting electrodes .",
    "foremost , on the thermal side , a temperature gradient imposed across the s@xmath13is@xmath2 junction can produce a sizable effect of ndtc , which exhibits a maximum peak - to - valley ratio @xmath42 in the transmitted electronic heat current when the phase difference between the superconducting condensates is @xmath75 .",
    "this requirement can be fulfilled with the help of a three - junction squid controlled by an external magnetic flux . with these elements , we envisioned two different designs for a thermal tunnel diode , which could immediately be implemented to observe a temperature modulation as large as 80 mk due to the ndtc effect . under proper conditions",
    ", this device would also produce a thermal hysteresis that might serve to store information in a solid - state memory device at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "finally , we showed the potential applications of ndtc into two versions of a thermal transistor . in the first case",
    ", the device can act as a thermal switch and modulator , while in the second configuration our three - terminal structure operates as a thermal amplifier . in both the schemes we are able to obtain a remarkable heat amplification in a wide range ( @xmath222 mk ) of the gate temperature .",
    "this result is a strict consequence of the ndtc , as predicted by li _",
    "et al_.@xcite    the proposed systems could be easily implemented by standard nanofabrication techniques and , combined with caloritronic interferometers@xcite and thermal diodes,@xcite might represent the last missing pieces to complete the thermal reproduction of the most important electronic devices .",
