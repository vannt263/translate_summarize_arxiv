    ", we consider phenomena associated with one such behavior  the negative response of a particle s velocity to an applied force .",
    "earlier experiments and computer simulations have studied how particles in glass forming systems respond to external forces  @xcite .",
    "a range of effects have been found , including the appearance of a threshold force  @xcite and non - linear velocity / force relations  @xcite , the vanishing of the linear response regime at low temperatures  @xcite , the self - organisation of forced particles  @xcite , and negative response to chemical potential gradients @xcite . here",
    ", we study the response of a probe particle  @xcite to a weak external force with numerical simulations and with analytic methods . the numerical work employs kinetically constrained models of glass formers  @xcite .",
    "the analytical work employs a continuous time random walk model  @xcite , specifically the model  @xcite introduced to treat effects due to decoupling between persistence and exchange processes  @xcite .",
    "while originally constructed in the context of kinetically constrained lattice models , essential features of dynamics that justify this analytical model have been demonstrated in atomistic models of glass formers  @xcite .    experimental context for our results",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_exp ] : we compare results from one of our model systems with results for a colloidal system near to its glass transition . in order to make contact between model systems and experiments , we plot the probe velocity @xmath0 and the applied force @xmath1 in dimensionless units .",
    "the velocity is normalised by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the particle diameter , and @xmath4 is the diffusion constant of the probe in the absence of the externally applied force .",
    "the reduced velocity @xmath5 is proportional to the ` modified peclet number ' of ref.@xcite .",
    "the reduced force is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the temperature and @xmath8 is boltzmann s constant . in these units ,",
    "the linear response formula for the probe velocity is einstein s relation for small forces , @xmath9  @xcite . estimating these reduced quantities using data from refs .",
    "@xcite , we sketch the force - velocity relationship for the colloidal system in fig .  [ fig : vf_exp ] , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite has several important features .",
    "the most striking is the so - called threshold force , above which the velocity increases rapidly with applied force . on the other hand , for small enough forces ,",
    "the einstein relation must apply , although experimental constraints meant that this regime was not accessible in ref .",
    "interestingly , for the experimentally accessible forces below the threshold , the velocity is much smaller than the prediction of linear response : in fact , it was smaller than the experimental resolution limit",
    ". we can therefore identify a regime of intermediate force , where the force is much smaller than the threshold , and the response is much smaller than that predicted by the einstein relation .    according to our theoretical predictions",
    ", this regime , which has not yet been investigated experimentally , exhibits new and interesting phenomenology .",
    "figure  [ fig : vf_exp ] illustrates our predictions by showing results from our simulations of a kinetically constrained model ( details are given below ) . at small forces , the einstein relation is obeyed , while the response saturates at larger forces .",
    "this saturation represents a non - linear response that is consistent with the small sub - threshold responses observed in ref .",
    "our use of kinetically constrained models to describe the colloidal fluid rests on the assumption that glassy behaviour occurs when the motion of particles is constrained by their neighbours .",
    "we will see that saturation of the sub - threshold responses is a natural consequence of this assumption .",
    "however , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_exp ] that the tlg model does not reflect the experimental observation of a threshold force .",
    "our interpretation of the experimental data is that , as the applied force is increased through the threshold , the force on the probe particle becomes stronger than the constraint forces imposed by its neighbours . as a result ,",
    "the structure of the colloidal fluid is disrupted by the forced probe .",
    "thus the threshold force represents the limit of applicability of the kinetically constrained model  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we concentrate in this article on the regime of intermediate forces , where the kinetically constrained model should be applicable . in this regime",
    ", we find a surprising effect : increasing the applied force _ reduces _ the velocity of the pulled particle .",
    "this phenomenon and associated results are the focus of this paper .",
    "we begin by describing the models we use in numerical simulations .",
    "two are `` particle '' models , in the sense that the material in which the probe moves is described in terms of particles on a lattice with specified dynamical rules .",
    "the other is a `` field '' model in the sense that the material is described in terms of a so - called `` mobility '' field .",
    "the value of that field at a point on the lattice specifies whether or not motion is possible at that point .",
    "the specific field model is one of many possibilities , each representing a coarse grained approximation to a particle model  .",
    "the continuous - time random walk model  @xcite used later in this paper describes the coupling of the mobility field to particle motion .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ( i.e. , square ) version of kob and andersen s ( ka ) lattice model  @xcite , and the closely related triangular lattice gas ( tlg ) model of jckle and krnig  @xcite .",
    "these constrained lattice gases are assumed to capture effects of local jamming in a supercooled liquid .",
    "they have only excluded volume interactions , so , for a given filling fraction @xmath12 , all allowed configurations are equally likely .",
    "they exhibit non - trivial effects of correlated dynamics at filling fractions @xmath13 .",
    "dynamical heterogeneity is manifested as a clustering of mobile particles , and different transport properties decouple from one another ( for example , the translation diffusion coefficient does not scale inversely with the structural relaxation time  @xcite ) .",
    "these effects arise from constraints on the dynamics .    for the ka model @xcite , specifically the ( 2,2 )",
    "variant , particles live on a square lattice , with zero or single occupancy of lattice sites , and a particle may move to adjacent vacant sites only if the particle is adjacent to two vacant sites in both the initial and final sites . similarly , for jckle and krnig s tlg model , there is single or zero occupancy on a triangular lattice , and a particle may move to vacant sites only if both of the mutual nearest neighbours of the initial and final sites are vacant .",
    "accordingly , we refer to this model as the ( 2)-tlg  @xcite .",
    "its dynamical rules can be motivated on physical grounds by associating hard - cores to the particles , the diameter of which is equal to the lattice spacing , and by insisting that particles move along the lines connecting the points on the lattice . from that picture , it is seen that the dynamical rule is a straightforward steric effect ",
    "there is not enough room for a particle to pass to an empty nearest neighbor site unless the two common adjacent sites are also vacant .    in the absence of applied forces",
    ", all allowed processes happen with rate @xmath14 , which sets the fundamental unit of time .",
    "we implement the dynamics using asynchronous monte carlo updates .    in order to introduce a force @xmath1 on a single `` probe '' particle , we first consider that particle in an empty lattice .",
    "it would correspond to a single colloidal particle alone in a solvent . in the absence of the applied force",
    ", this particle has a bare diffusion constant @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the co - ordination number of the lattice , and we identify the particle diameter @xmath3 with the lattice spacing .",
    "we denote the force - dependent rates for translational moves of displacement @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that these rates obey a local form of detailed balance , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a reduced displacement . to ensure that an isolated probe obeys the einstein relation for all forces , we use the rates @xmath21 where the dimensionless function @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{g}\\ ] ] we have @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 .",
    "an alternative choice would be to use glauber dynamics [ @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , but in that case , the einstein relation applies only for small velocities , and there is an unphysical saturation at large forces .",
    "this saturation is an artifact of using a lattice to describe continuous space  @xcite : by using the rates of equ .",
    "( [ equ : rates ] ) , we ensure that the velocity of a single particle does not saturate .",
    "hence , the saturating response that we do observe is a physical effect , which appears as the motion of the probe particle becomes increasingly constrained by other particles in the system .",
    "we have also checked that while the data presented in this article do depend quantitatively on the choice of @xmath22 , their qualitative features are preserved if we instead use glauber dynamics .",
    "thus , while there is some arbitrariness in our use of eq .",
    "( [ equ : rates ] ) , we are confident that this choice does not affect our main conclusions .    throughout this article",
    ", we consider a single probe in a large system of unforced particles , ignoring the collective behaviour arising from interactions between forced particles  @xcite , and the effect of finite current densities  @xcite . to enhance statistics , we simulate large systems with a few probe particles in each , and we verify that our results are independent of the number of probes .",
    "due to the underlying lattice , our models are not isotropic , so there is some dependence on the direction of the force compared to the lattice axes ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we find that the results are qualitatively similar for all angles .",
    "we also consider the one - dimensional one spin facilitated fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model @xcite . in this model",
    "the local structure is described by a binary variable @xmath28 .",
    "sites with @xmath29 are ` mobile ' , or excited : particles in these regions are able to move ; those with @xmath30 are ` jammed ' , so that motion is very unlikely .",
    "sites may change their state only if they are adjacent to a site with @xmath29 . in that case",
    "they flip from @xmath31 to @xmath32 with rate @xmath33 and from @xmath32 to @xmath31 with rate unity ( this choice sets the unit of time in this model ) , where @xmath34 is a dimensionless inverse temperature .",
    "the dynamics obey detailed balance , with an energy function @xmath35 , so the equilibrium state has no correlations between sites .",
    "this model exhibits effects of non - trivial correlated dynamics for @xmath36 .",
    "while the relaxation time of the fa model exhibits arrhenius temperature dependence  @xcite , in @xmath37 and at low temperature , the model has significant fluctuation effects .",
    "these are manifested by stretched exponential relaxation  @xcite and transport decoupling  @xcite .",
    "other kinetically constrained models of mobility fields , such as the east model  @xcite exhibit similar phenomenology in all dimensions , but the @xmath38 fa model is sufficient to capture the essential physical effects discussed in this article  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , probe particles were coupled to the fa model .",
    "probes were allowed to hop between adjacent sites only when both initial and final sites were mobile . with this choice , the dynamical rules for",
    "the @xmath39 do not depend on the positions of the probe particle .",
    "while the forced probe is affected by its environment , there is no mechanism for a back - reaction , where the effect of the force feeds back onto the @xmath39 variables .",
    "thus , an excitation in an fa model can pass through this type of probe particle without any knowledge of the probe s presence .",
    "we therefore refer to the probes of ref .",
    "@xcite as ` ghost ' probes .",
    "for particle - based models , including the kcms introduced above , forced probe particles do have significant effects on their environment .",
    "for this reason we introduce an alternative set of rules for probe particles in the fa model , which allow us to model this back - reaction .",
    "in particular , since the presence of a probe reduces the available free volume , we imagine that its presence is sufficient to render the site immobile .",
    "thus , we modify the model of ref",
    ".  @xcite by assuming probes can not occupy mobile sites . in this case",
    ", the probe moves through the system by swapping places with mobility excitations .",
    "if the probe position is @xmath40 , then the allowed moves are @xmath41 clearly , the dynamics of the fa model itself are now coupled to those of the probes .",
    "we therefore refer to these as ` fully coupled probes ' . the rates for attempted moves of both coupled and ghost probes are given by eq.([equ : rates ] ) , with @xmath42 .",
    "the drift velocity of the probe is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the displacement of the probe in time @xmath45 , and the average is taken in the presence of the applied force . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_model](a ) we plot this velocity as a function of force in the ( 2)-tlg and ( 2,2)-ka models , at densities above their onsets to cooperative dynamics .",
    "the linear response ( i.e. , einstein ) relation is @xmath46 , where @xmath4 is the zero - force diffusion constant , @xmath47 at densities above the onset , @xmath13 , @xmath4 is much smaller than its bare value @xmath15 .",
    "the striking result of negative response , i.e. , negative differential mobility , @xmath48 , is found for @xmath49 .",
    "a similar effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_model](b ) for the fully coupled probes in the fa model",
    ". however , negative differential mobility does not occur for the ghost probes . in that case , non - linear effects only lead to a saturation of the drift velocity with force  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_temp ] , we show how this response depends on the temperature . keeping the reduced force @xmath50 fixed , the velocity decreases monotonically as the temperature is reduced . at high temperatures ,",
    "the dependence on the force is monotonic ; negative differential mobility appears below the onset temperature , @xmath51 . for these temperatures ,",
    "the linear response ( small force ) regime is @xmath52 , and negative differential mobility is observed near @xmath53 , below the onset temperature .    the lack of non - monotonic behavior for ghost particles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_model](b ) points to the mechanism for non - monotonic behavior .",
    "we use fig .  [",
    "fig : mech ] to illustrate the mechanism .",
    "in particular , we show how applying a large force to a probe particle can prevent the movement of neighbouring particles or mobility excitations .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : mech](c ) shows a configuration in the ( 2)-tlg for which the probe can make progress in the direction of the force , but only if it first moves backwards , allowing the neighbouring particles to move out of its way . in the fa model ,",
    "[ fig : mech](b ) , illustrates how a single excitation may allow a single probe to make several steps along the direction of the force  @xcite .",
    "however , this process is suppressed at large forces , since it also involves steps in which the probe moves against the force . at large forces , most encounters between probe and excitation are of the form shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mech](a ) , and the probe makes only one step in each such encounter . in both cases , the forced probe acts to suppress local relaxation , and the force acts to slow down the motion of the probe particle .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for ka models show a non - monotonic response similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_model ] . in that case , all particles attain a finite drift velocity due to force gradients applied to many particles , and large scale density changes result .",
    "the effects found in that work are related to those we present here , but in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect we consider arises from forces on a single forced particle that produce no large scale density changes .",
    "non - monotonic response of a drift velocity has also been demonstrated for systems with quenched disorder  @xcite , but the origin of these phenomena is different from those that underlie the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and of fig .",
    "[ fig : vf_model ] , where the mechanisms involve the dynamics of the medium .",
    "finally , we note that the saturation velocity is finite in all of the models that we consider .",
    "this is to be contrasted with systems with large numbers of forced particles , in which their velocity may appear to vanish at large forces  @xcite . for single forced particles ,",
    "our results suggest that the saturation velocity will be finite as long as the unbiased diffusion constant is finite .",
    "[ in kcms with glass transitions at finite densities ( or temperatures )  @xcite , all particles are localised in the glass phase : we expect @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath50 . ]",
    "to further elucidate the mechanism for the non - monotonic responses described above , we use a continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) analysis  @xcite .",
    "we use the model of  @xcite , which exploits the existence of two separate timescales in glassy systems , corresponding to two different physical processes : exchange and persistence events  @xcite .",
    "recently , rubner and heuer  @xcite analysed how motion on an underlying energy landscape can result in particle motion that resembles a ctrw .",
    "earlier applications of ctrws to glassy materials include trapping models such as  @xcite , and mostly focussed on the physical consequences of diverging time scales . in the following",
    ", we will assume that all time scales are finite , ensuring that we recover the physical limit of simple diffusion at long times .",
    "consider a single probe particle , which makes a series of uncorrelated steps through a fluctuating environment .",
    "the force on the probe enters as a bias on the direction of these steps .",
    "the probe s environment is dynamically heterogeneous , with space - time permeated with entangled excitation lines  @xcite .",
    "the probe moves only where it is intersected by these lines . in this way",
    ", the time between successive steps acquires large fluctuations .",
