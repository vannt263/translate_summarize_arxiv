    "entanglement plays an important role in distinguishing the nature of quantum versus classical systems .",
    "it is an essential ingredient for quantum computation .",
    "it also connects quantum information theory to the traditional quantum many - body systems , for example , quantum critical phenomena @xcite and topological systems such as fractional quantum hall effects @xcite , topological insulators @xcite and graphene @xcite . in recent developments entanglement",
    "has also been related to numerical methods based on tensor network algorithms , ranging from the density - matrix renormalization group and matrix product state@xcite , to the projected entangled pair states , and variational renormalization group methods @xcite .",
    "one can measure the entanglement of a pure state using bipartite entanglement entropy : consider a pure state @xmath1 of a bipartite total system @xmath2 that consists of the system @xmath3 and the environment @xmath4 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the system a is @xmath5 .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath6 , has been widely used to measure the bipartite entanglement between the system @xmath3 and the environment @xmath4 .",
    "the entanglement entropy is especially useful for studying quantum criticality . in one dimension ,",
    "scaling of entanglement entropy is well understood both for fermions and for bosons .",
    "for one - dimensional quantum chains at zero temperature , it is generally known that the entanglement entropy @xmath7 of a system @xmath3 saturates away from criticality , however , it scales logarithmically when the system becomes quantum - critical , that is , when the correlation length diverges . in the latter case , conformal field ( cft )",
    "theory @xcite yields @xmath8 where @xmath0 and @xmath9 are holomorphic and antiholomorphic central charges of the cft and @xmath10 is a model - dependent constant . for a quantum critical system with an unknown central charge",
    ", one can estimate @xmath0 by calculating the scaling of entanglement entropy .",
    "for the conveniency of numerical calculations , the scaling law of entanglement entropy for finite sizes @xcite @xmath11 + k ,   \\label{eqn : s_scalingfinite}\\ ] ] for a subsystem of size @xmath12 and total size @xmath13 ( the size of the system plus environment ) is often used instead of the infinite size one eq .",
    "( [ eqn : s_scalinginfinite ] ) . in our system discussed below @xmath14 .",
    "however , the general knowledge about the scaling law of entanglement entry for non - critical systems is not 100 percent correct .",
    "there are some exceptions .",
    "it is pointed out recently that even when the system loses the conformal invariance , the entanglement entropy @xmath7 can still scale logarithmically with the system size .",
    "examples include the ferromagnetic heisenberg model @xcite and the infinite random fixed point ( irfp ) of several random spin chain models @xcite .",
    "those systems are at the crossover points between critical and gapped systems and , most essentially , their ground states are highly degenerate .",
    "therefore it is possible to define an effective central charge for those gapped but symmetric systems , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : s_scalinginfinite ] ) , as three times the coefficient in front of the logarithmic scaling . in this work",
    "we are interested in the situation where the cft regime ends at a ferromagnetic point with an effective central charge that is larger than the central charge of the cft regime .",
    "we found that , if one only uses eq .",
    "( [ eqn : s_scalingfinite ] ) to calculate central charges for finite systems , the central charges are influenced by the ferromagnetic points .",
    "hence , we study the effects of such a nearby ferromagnetic point on the estimation of the value of the central charge from the numerical simulation .",
    "we find that , depending on the algorithms and the physical quantities used to extract the value of central charge , different crossover behavior arises as the system approaches the ferromagnetic point from within the critical regime .",
    "based on these results we show how to determine if the central charge estimation is strongly influenced by the crossover behavior and how to properly evaluate the central charge .",
    "we consider the 1d spin-1/2 anisotropic heisenberg",
    "( xxz ) model with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the anisotropy . for @xmath17",

    "the system is in the ferromagnetic ising phase which spontaneously breaks the spin reflection symmetry .",
    "the ground states are two - fold degenerate and fully polarized in @xmath19 directions . when @xmath20 the system is in the gapless critical xy phase .",
    "it is known that the critical xy phase is described by a @xmath21 cft .",
    "the point @xmath22 is very special and is the main interest of this work .",
    "we will refer this point as the _ ferromagnetic point _ in the rest of the manuscript .",
    "at @xmath22 the symmetry of the hamiltonian is enlarged to isotropic ferromagnet with full rotational symmetry .",
    "the ground states are infinitely degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however the system is not conformally invariant at this point .",
    "when the system is in the ferromagnetic phase @xmath23 the entanglement saturates as one increases the block size .",
    "however , it has been shown when @xmath22 there is an essential singularity in the entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that in the limit of @xmath24 the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size but with a coefficient that is larger than the critical regime @xcite . for @xmath25 $ ]",
    "the ground state is @xmath26 symmetric and has @xmath27 . at the ferromagnetic point",
    "the symmetry of the hamiltonian is enlarged to su(2 ) , but this is broken by the ground state and hence there are infinitely many degenerate ground states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is exactly this ground stage degeneracy that gives rise to the logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy . in this work",
    "we are interested in the entanglement entropy scaling of the ground state that is smoothly connected to the ground state in the critical xy phase .",
    "this particular ground state at the ferromagnetic point can be reached by taking the @xmath28 limit , which corresponds to the ferromagnetic ground state with @xmath29 = 0 .",
    "it is predicted that as @xmath24 one has @xmath30 this corresponds to an effect central charge @xmath31 which is larger than the @xmath21 in the xy phase .",
    "consequently from entanglement entropy scaling point of view , there is a jump from @xmath21 for @xmath25 $ ] to @xmath31 as @xmath24 . for any numerical simulation ,",
    "however , it is expected that such an abrupt jump is smeared out .",
    "the resulting crossover behavior may depend on the algorithms and finite - size effects .",
    "consequently , conventional methods to extract the value of central charge may be influenced by the nearby ferromagnetic point .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , such an influence is not widely studied in the literature .",
    "furthermore , it is pointed out in ref.@xcite that at @xmath22 it is possible to have @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath34 depends on the particular ground state one choose and @xmath34 can be interpreted as the ( not necessarily an integer ) number of zero - energy goldstone bosons describing the ground state .",
    "it is , however , not clear how such a prediction manifest itself in the conventional calculation of the entanglement entropy .    to investigate these issues",
    ", we use three different methods to evaluate the central charge in the regime @xmath35 $ ] in this work .",
    "the first two methods study the entanglement scaling of a finite and an infinite system respectively while the third method studies the scaling of the ground state energy .",
    "two numerical algorithms are used to evaluate relevant quantities for finite systems and infinite systems .",

    "( note that idmrg is not the infinite size dmrg algorithm that is used in the warm up stage of the dmrg algorithm . )",
    "we pay special attention to the behavior when @xmath36 . for the rest of the manuscript we will express this limit as @xmath37 for clarity .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : ent_finite ] , we use the entanglement entropy scaling of a finite - system to estimate the value of the central charge . in sec.[sec : ent_infinite ] , we study the entanglement entropy scaling of an infinite - system . in sec.[sec : ent_gs ] , we use finite - size scaling of the ground state energy to extract the central charge value .",
    "spin - wave velocity and the scaling dimension of the primary field are also estimated in sec.[sec : scaling ] . in sec.[sec : sum ] we discuss our results and suggest a strategy to determine accurately the value of the central charge when there is a ferromagnetic point nearby .",

    "most of the numerical studies in the literation to confirm the cft predictions on xxz chain concentrates on the regime of @xmath44 .",
    "some works extend the study to @xmath45 @xcite but are not focused on the limit of @xmath46 , which is the main interest of this work . here",
    "the dmrg algorithm @xcite is used to obtain the ground state wave - function of a finite system with length @xmath13 with periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the entanglement entropy @xmath47 between a block of length @xmath12 and the rest of the system . in this work",
    "we use dmrg that preserves the @xmath26 symmetry and target the @xmath27 sector .",
    "this is to ensure that the proper ground state is reached as we take the @xmath24 limit .",
    "we define an @xmath13-dependent effective central charge @xmath41 by fitting the data using eq.[eqn : s_scalingfinite ] .",
    "the subscripts dmrg is used to distinguish from the central charge obtained by other methods .",
    "since the accuracy of the dmrg ground state depends on the number of states kept ( denoted as @xmath48 ) , it is important to study how @xmath41 depends on @xmath48 . for a given @xmath13 , the entanglement entropy",
    "@xmath47 reaches its maximum at half - chain @xmath49 and grows logarithmically with @xmath13 in the critical regime .",
    "on the other hand the maximal half - chain entanglement entropy attainable by dmrg is @xmath50 .",
    "it is then natural to expect that for larger @xmath13 the value of @xmath41 may depend strongly on the @xmath48 used . in inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : c_eff ] we show the value of @xmath51 evaluated using @xmath43 , and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "we observe that for a fixed @xmath16 the value of @xmath0 monotonically increases as @xmath48 increases .",
    "we find that while the data of @xmath53 seem to fit eq.[eqn : s_scalingfinite ] well ( not shown here ) , the fitted @xmath54 seems to deviate substantially from the results obtained with larger @xmath48 .",
    "this indicates that @xmath53 is too small to accurately determine the value of @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast for @xmath55 the value starts to converge .",
    "we also find that for smaller @xmath56 , @xmath53 and @xmath57 lead to similar values of @xmath54 and it is unnecessary to go to larger @xmath48 .",
    "these results suggest that in order to estimate reliably the central charge , one should increase @xmath48 until the value of @xmath54 start to saturate or perform the extrapolation of @xmath48 to infinity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_eff ] , we plot @xmath41 as a function of @xmath38 for various @xmath13 . in this plot",
    "we ensure that sufficiently large @xmath48 is used for each @xmath13 . for a fixed @xmath13",
    ", we observe that @xmath41 monotonically increases as @xmath38 decreases to zero from the positive side .",
    "consequently the central charge deviates more and more from the cft prediction @xmath21 when approaching the ferromagnetic point .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath37 , @xmath41 seems to approachf @xmath58 , the value predicted in ref.@xcite regardless the @xmath13 used . recall that we use dmrg with u(1 ) symmetry and we target the ground state with @xmath27 , which is exactly the state considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "hence at @xmath22 one expects @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "we also observe that for a fixed @xmath16 , @xmath41 decreases monotonically as @xmath13 increases and the crossover from @xmath21 to @xmath31 become sharper and shaper as @xmath13 increases .",
    "based on all the observations above , we expect that in the thermodynamic limit the function @xmath54 becomes non - analytic at @xmath22 , resulting in @xmath21 for @xmath61 $ ] and jump to @xmath62 at @xmath22 .",
    "this picture is consistent with the theoretical prediction of ref.@xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the calculation in ref.@xcite , in which by exact diagonalization of small @xmath13 systems it is found that the entanglement spectrum deviates substantially from the cft prediction when @xmath63 . from the numerical point of view",
    ", the important observation is that for smaller @xmath13 the crossover regime is larger and one can overestimate the central charge by a large amount .",
    "it is also important to note that if the number of states kept for the dmrg calculation is too small , one can underestimate the central charge . since the error due to finite @xmath13 and finite @xmath48",

    "we conclude that @xmath76 provided that only data with @xmath78 are used for the fitting .",
    "this is consistent with the cft prediction and the results in the proceeding section ( after taking the limit of @xmath80 ) .",
    "we find that when the system gets very close to the ferromagnetic point , the deviation from the expected result @xmath21 becomes larger .",
    "this is due to ( 1 ) larger @xmath70 is needed to have enough data with @xmath78 and ( 2 ) there are many nearly degenerate low energy states when the system approaches the ferromagnetic point , making it more difficult for idmrg to converge .",
    "furthermore , it is surprising to observe that all the data with @xmath81 seem to fall on a universal straight line regardless the value of @xmath16 .",

    "we find that the error is very small for @xmath123 but grows rapidly as one approaches the ferromagnetic point .",
    "this is understandable since the spin - wave velocity should approach zero at the ferromagnetic boundary which makes it very difficult to be accurately determined by the numerical simulation .",

    "inset : absolute error of the spin wave velocity @xmath122 . ]    from the results in the preceding three sections we find that the value of central charge extracted from typical simulation might deviate from the cft prediction when the system is close to the ferromagnetic point .",
    "this might make it more difficult to identify the underlying cft from the value of central charge alone .",
    "another quantity which can be used to identify the cft is the scaling dimension of the primary field .",

    "[ fig : scaling ] we plot the absolute errors @xmath135 of the results obtained by using exact velocity ( black dot ) and estimated velocity ( red dot ) respectively .",
    "we find that the error is extremely small when the exact velocity is used in the whole parameter regime including the ferromagnetic point .",

    "[ eq : scaling_dimension ] , the finite - size scaling formula of the scaling dimension , is less influenced by the ferromagnetic point provided that the exact spin - wave velocity is used .",

    "[ fig : scaling ] this makes the estimated scaling dimension less accurate near the ferromagnetic point .",

    "we find that all methods are influenced by the nearby ferromagnetic point but different crossover behavior appears .",
    "we also find that the nontrivial scaling of the ferromagnetic point only manifests itself in the first two methods , which are entanglement based . in the following we",
    "briefly summarize the crossover behavior and the proper procedure to estimate @xmath0 within each method .",
    "we also suggest that one should employ all three methods and use the consistency between different methods as an additional check for the accuracy of the value of @xmath0 .    in any finite - size calculation",
    "we observe a smooth crossover between these two values .",
    "we show that the proper procedure is that for a fixed @xmath13 one need to increase @xmath48 until a saturated value of @xmath0 is reached .",
    "one then increases @xmath13 until @xmath0 is not sensitive to the changes in @xmath13 . if the value of @xmath0 is still changing when one reaches the largest @xmath13 one can calculate , the corresponding @xmath0 value can not be trusted .",
    "when idmrg is used , however , a different crossover behavior appears .",
    "here we show that there is a @xmath16 dependent crossover length scale @xmath69 such that for scales above the system scales according to the cft prediction while for scales below the system scales according to the ferromagnetic point . for any model with a nearby ferromagnetic like point we suggest that one should increase @xmath48 ( hence @xmath66 ) gradually to check if such a crossover behavior appears or not .",
    "we also show that the conventional method to use finite - size scaling of the ground state energy to determine @xmath0 also suffers from the influence of the nearby ferromagnetic point .",
    "it induces a sub - leading correction which seems to have an opposite sign with respect to the logarithmic correction due to the marginally irrelevant operator . for the unknown model",
    ", the sign of the correction can be used to detect the existence of such an influence . here",
    "we suggest that one should just discard smaller size data .",
    "in addition , we show that the finite - size scaling relation between the excited state energy and the scaling dimension of the primary field is less influenced by the ferromagnetic point , provided that exact spin - wave velocity is used .",

    "<S> we study the entanglement entropy scaling of the xxz chain . while in the critical xy phase of the xxz chain the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with a coefficient that is determined by the associated conformal field theory , at the ferromagnetic point , however , the system is not conformally invariant yet the entanglement entropy still scales logarithmically albeit with a different coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how such an nontrivial scaling at the ferromagnetic point influences the estimation of the central charge @xmath0 in the critical xy phase . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we use the entanglement scaling of the finite or infinite system , as well as the finite - size scaling of the ground state energy to estimate the value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the spin - wave velocity and the scaling dimension are also estimated . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in all methods the evaluations are influenced by the nearby ferromagnetic point and result in crossover behavior . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss how to determine whether the central charge estimation is strongly influenced by the crossover behavior and how to properly evaluate the central charge . </S>"
