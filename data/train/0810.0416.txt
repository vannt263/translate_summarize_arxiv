    "rs cvn - type stars are binary systems where the most massive primary component is a g - k giant or subgiant and the secondary is a subgiant or dwarf of spectral classes g to m. these systems are well known due to their strong chromospheric plages , coronal x - ray emission , and strong flares in the optical , uv , radio , and x - ray .",
    "most long - term stellar activity studies of rs cvn stars are derived from the easily detected optical photometric variations produced by their long - lived large spots . in most cases ,",
    "the mean magnitude reflects a stellar activity cycle similar to the 11-year solar one . on the other hand",
    ", the peak - to - peak magnitude shows a shorter cycle , called flip - flop cycle , which reflects the non axisymmetrical redistribution of the spotted area on the stellar surface .",
    "the iue database provides a large number of uv high and low resolution spectra of these type of stars . furthermore , the iue satellite monitored these stars continuously during several seasons . in the present work",
    ", we have measured the mg ii line - core fluxes on the iue low and high resolution spectra of three rs cvn - type stars ( ii peg , ux ari and v711 tau ) and then converted the fluxes to the mount wilson index @xmath1 . for each star",
    ", we analyzed the mean annual index @xmath2 with the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite to search for a long - term chromospheric cycle .",
    "following daz et al . , we obtained the rotational modulation of the @xmath1-index for several seasons by fitting the light - curves with a harmonic function .",
    "we analyzed the amplitude of each curve with the lomb - scargle periodogram to search for a chromospheric flip - flop cycle .",
    "ii peg ( hd 224085 ) is a single - lined rs cvn - binary system composed by a k2iv star and an unseen companion of an estimated spectral class m0-m3v . in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd224085 ] we plot the mount wilson index @xmath1 derived from the iue high and low resolution spectra obtained between 1979 and 1995 .",

    "we obtained a peak at 7741 days ( @xmath021 years ) with a false alarm probability ( fap ) of 35% .",
    "secondly , we analyzed the rotational modulation of the index @xmath1 during the seasons indicated with arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd224085 ] . to do so",
    ", we phased each season s light - curve @xmath1 vs. time with the 6.724-day rotation period ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.hd224085_curvas ] ) and we fitted each set of data with the harmonic function : @xmath6 .",
    "we analyzed the amplitude @xmath7 against time with the lomb - scargle periodogram and we obtained a cyclic pattern of 3310 @xmath8 253 days ( 9.07 @xmath8 0.69 years ) with a fap of 31% .",
    "this periodic behaviour seems to be well correlated with the flip - flop cycle with a period of 9.30 years obtained by berdyugina and tuominen for the spot activity .",
    "ux ari ( hd 21242 ) is a rs cvn - type system composed by a k0iv star and a g5v companion in a 6.483-day orbit . in fig .",
    "[ fig.hd21242 ] we plot the index @xmath1 obtained for this star between 1978 and 1996 .",

    "v711 tau ( hr 1099 , hd 22468 ) is one of the most active rs cvn non - eclipsing spectroscopic binary system , consisting of a k1 subgiant primary and a g5 dwarf secondary in a 2.837 day - orbit @xcite . in fig .",
