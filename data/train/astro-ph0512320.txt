    "post - agb stars represent a relatively short - lived transition phase between asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and white dwarf ( wd ) stars . all stars with initial masses between 1 and about 8  m@xmath0 become h- and he - shell burning agb stars and end their lives as wds with a carbon - oxygen core .",
    "the model evolution is shown in fig.[fig : hrd ] for initially @xmath1 .",
    "more massive super - agb stars up to @xmath2 may end as onemg wds . during the hottest phases ,",
    "post - agb stars are surrounded by a planetary nebula ( pn ) , ionized material lost by the precursor agb star .",
    "canonical stellar evolution predicts that throughout all evolutionary phases these stars retain hydrogen - rich envelopes which , however , can become contaminated by processed material from the interior by dredge - up events occurring in the red giant branch ( rgb ) and agb stages .",
    "such an evolution is described by the solid line in fig.[fig : hrd ] .",
    "already decades ago , the observation of central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) exhibiting emission - line spectra which are very similar to those of massive wolf - rayet stars with strong helium and carbon emission lines ( i.e. spectral type wc ) suggested the existence of hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "later , the palomar - green survey revealed a new spectral class of h - deficient post - agb stars , the pg1159 stars , which are dominated by absorption lines of highly ionised he , c , and o @xcite .",
    "it is now believed that the pg1159 stars are descendants of the wolf - rayet cspn and that the majority of them will evolve into wds with helium atmospheres ( i.e. non - da white dwarfs ) .",
    "the origin of the hydrogen - deficiency in [ wc ] and pg1159 stars is probably a late helium - shell flash , which means that a post - agb star ( or wd ) re - ignites helium - shell burning and transforms the star back into an agb star .",
    "this `` born - again agb star '' phenomenon has been discovered in early stellar evolution modeling @xcite and was later invoked to explain the h - deficiency observed in some hot post - agb stars @xcite . a complete evolutionary track of such a born - again evolution is shown as a dashed line in fig.[fig : hrd ] .",
    "the late he - shell flash causes complete envelope mixing .",
    "hydrogen is ingested and burnt and the surface chemistry of the star becomes dominated by the composition of the previous he / c / o - rich intershell layer ( the region between the h- and he - burning shells of the agb star , see sect.[sec : agbevolution ] ) .    in `` usual '' , i.e. hydrogen - rich ( post- ) agb stars intershell matter can be dredged up to the surface ( so - called third dredge - up ) and results in the pollution of the photosphere with intershell matter , that is , helium , 3@xmath3-burning products ( c , o , ne ) as well as s - process elements which are produced by neutron capture in the he - burning environment .",
    "the study of s - process element abundances in agb stars was and is the most important tool to reveal details of the physics of burning and mixing processes .",
    "it is essential to understand these processes , because they affect the yields from agb stars which largely drive the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "in contrast to these h - rich stars , [ wc ] and pg1159 stars do not exhibit just traces of intershell matter in their photospheres , but they are essentially made up of intershell matter .",
    "this is because the mass of the intershell is much larger than that of the hydrogen envelope and , thus , its composition dominates the mixture of both layers triggered by the late he - flash .",
    "these h - deficient post - agb stars therefore offer the unique possibility to study intershell abundances _ directly _ and , hence , understand the physical processes leading to the composition .",

    "it is seen that they span a wide temperature and gravity range .",
    "they represent stars in their hottest phase of post - agb evolution . some of them ( those with @xmath13 6.5 ) are still helium - shell burners ( located before the `` knee '' in their evolutionary track ) while the majority has already entered the wd cooling sequence",

    "however , the h - deficient @xmath14 track ( dashed - dotted lines in fig.[fighrd ] ) is systematically hotter than the older tracks , and indicates that the central stars are on average in fact somewhat less massive than that .",
    "it is important to note , that the higher temperature of the new tracks is not the result of being h - deficient .",
    "instead , the reason is the more realistic agb progenitor evolution that now includes the third dredge - up after most of the agb thermal pulses .",
    "this leads to a higher luminosity for a given core mass and during the post - agb evolution to higher temperature ( sect.[sec : hrdnew ] ) .",

    "the quality of the abundance determination is also very different from star to star .",
    "for some objects only relatively poor optical spectra were analysed , while others were scrutinized with great care using high s / n high - resolution optical _ and _ uv / fuv data .",
    "nevertheless , we think that the abundance scatter is real .",
    "the prototype pg1159 - 035 displays what could be called a `` mean '' abundance pattern : he / c / o=0.33/0.50/0.17 .",

    "taking all analyses into account , the range of mass fractions for these elements is , approximately : he=0.300.85 , c=0.150.60 , o=0.020.20 ( excluding the peculiar object h1504 + 65 , see sect .  [ secth1504 ] ) .",
    "there is a strong preference for a helium abundance in the range 0.30.5 , independent of the stellar mass ( fig .",

    "element abundances should be accurate within a factor of two .",
    "the main problem arises from uncertainties in line broadening theory which directly affects the gravity determination and the abundance analysis of he , c , and o.      we already mentioned that hydrogen is difficult to detect .",

    "it therefore seems that stellar rotation at this point is rather indirectly relevant for the interpretation of abundance patterns of h - deficient post - agb stars .",
    "when the agb star has lost all but approximately @xmath46 of its envelope mass it starts the transition from the giant configuration to the white dwarf configuration @xcite .",
    "the remaining envelope contracts and the star evolves at constant luminosity to the hot stellar temperatures ( @xmath10 30000  k ) that are required for central stars to ionize the planetary nebulae .",
    "mass loss plays an important role in determining the transition velocity during this phase @xcite .",
    "eventually hydrogen shell - burning stops and both the stellar luminosity and effective temperature start to decrease ( fig.[fig : hrd ] ) .",
    "the star is about to enter the white dwarf cooling track .",
    "up to this point the star retains the ability to ignite a he - shell flash , if the amount of he accreted from the h - shell is large enough , and the density in the he - shell is high enough .",
    "such a post - agb he - shell flash will initiate a born - again evolution during which the star is reborn as a giant star .",
    "the basic concept of the born - again evolution scenario was established by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xcite have already speculated about the existence of two distinct born - again evolution channels , to which we now refer as the late thermal pulse ( ltp ) and the very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) .",
    "we add to those a variation of single star evolution that may be able to produce ( possibly only mildly ) h - deficient hot post - agb stars without a born - again evolution , the so - called agb final thermal pulse ( aftp ) .      in the vltp born - again evolution case the pdcz ( fig.[fig : kipp ] )",
    "is able to penetrate into the remaining h - rich envelope , triggering a h - ingestion flash ( hif ) that imposes its own nuclear burning and mixing signature on the subsequent evolution @xcite .",
    "this hif is possible when the he - shell flash occurs very late in the post - agb evolution , when the star is converging onto the white dwarf cooling track . at that time the h - shell is inactive , and provides no entropy jump that could prohibit convective instability below to spread outwards .",
    "the time at which a he - shell flash can occur during the post - agb evolution depends on the thermal pulse phase at which the star leaves the agb . a departure too early in the cycle means that no he - shell flash will happen , a departure too late in the cycle means a he - shell flash is triggered early in the post - agb phase when the h - shell is still on , resulting in a ltp born - again evolution , rather than a vltp .",
    "most born - again models that have been presented more recently are in fact vltp models @xcite .",
    "the chain of events starts with the onset of the he - shell flash convection that spreads over the entire intershell as the he - burning luminosity quickly increases in thermonuclear runaway .",
    "close to the peak luminosity the convective instability extends into the h - rich , unprocessed envelope .",
    "protons are transported on the convective time - scale into the hot , deep layers of the pdcz .",
    "eventually the proton - rich material reaches temperatures that are high enough to allow the @xmath47 reaction to proceed on the convective time scale . at this position within the pdcz",
    "the peak h - burning energy will be released .",
    "if we believe the 1d - stellar evolution models the energy generation leads to the formation of a separate convection zone driven by the h - burning energy , and separated from the he - shell convection zone beneath by a small radiative layer .",
    "the upper h - burning layer probably engulfs the entire material up to the stellar surface , and burns its hydrogen content .",
    "whatever traces of h maybe left will very likely be shed off by mass loss during the subsequent giant phase .",
    "the vltp model computations certainly are among the numerically more difficult stages of stellar evolution .",
    "nevertheless , several improvements have been made in recent years .",
    "the vltp model by @xcite included a reliable , fully implicit numerical method for solving simultaneously the nuclear network and the time - dependent mixing equations .",
    "they also based their post - agb evolution sequence on an agb progenitor with convective extra mixing ( sect.[sec : cem ] ) . in that way",
    "the model could reproduce the observed high o abundance in [ wc ] and pg1159 stars .",
    "for the surface abundances , especially oxygen , @xcite come to the same conclusion .",
    "when it became clear that sakurai s object was in fact a vltp case in which the born - again evolution from the pre - wd to the giant phase was witnessed in real - time ( sect.[kap : hist ] ) it also became clear that this star was not following the script that had been laid out by any of the previous calculations .",
    "the born - again evolution from the he - shell flash to the giant configuration has been observed to be only about two years .",
    "however , any previous vltp calculation predicted born - again evolution times of a factor @xmath48 @xcite to @xmath49 @xcite longer . an important difference between these two calculations is the numerical treatment of simultaneous burning and mixing , opacities , and metallicity , which collectively make a factor of 10 difference very plausible .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 2 , section d - e ) show that the duration of the constant luminosity part of the born - again evolution is about three times shorter for @xmath50 compared to @xmath51 . in any case , the important point is that these calculations do agree in the fact that sakurai s object was retracing the evolution back to the agb much faster than predicted by vltp models .",
    "this indicated , that the born - again evolution time is sensitive to the numerics , and as well to the physics of burning and mixing , and possibly other input physics .",
    "subsequently a new generation of models of the vltp has appeared . at the 2000 workshop _",
    "sakurai s object : what have we learned in the first five years ? _ in keele , uk , @xcite presented vltp tracks with two loops , similar to the track shown dashed in fig.[fig : hrd ] .",
    "the difference between these new models with double - loop ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and previous models was not clear initially .",
    "then , @xcite showed a connection between the convective mixing speed of surface h into the hot he- and @xmath36-rich layers deeper inside and the born - again evolution time from the hot pre - white dwarf stage back to the giant configuration .",
    "the @xcite and the @xcite models as well as all later vltp models use some simultaneous treatment of nuclear burning and convective time - dependent mixing in which the nuclear network equation sets in each mass shell are solved together with the diffusion equations for each species .",
    "although the basic concept is similar in all more recent models the details of the numerical solution technique differ , with possible consequences for the calculated born - again time scale .",
    "@xcite performed a series of tests for a @xmath14 post - agb star with a range of mixing speeds .",
    "peak nuclear burning of ingested h with @xmath36should occur where the nuclear and the mixing time scales are the same . as the temperature strongly increases as protons convectively diffuse inward the nuclear time scale decreases . for reduced mixing velocity",
    "the mixing time scale is larger and the position of equality of nuclear and mixing time scales is closer to the surface than with a faster mixing velocity as predicted by the mixing - length theory .",
    "these models suggested that a solar metallicity model with a mass of @xmath14 could reproduce the born - again evolution time of sakurai s object if the convective mixing speed is reduced by a factor @xmath49 .",
    "@xcite discuss the effect of reducing the mixing efficiency for three values : reduction by @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this may be a different regime than the one explored by @xcite , because they report a longer evolution time scale for a reduction factor @xmath54 than for @xmath53 .",
    "it should be noted however , that neither of these models included some possibly important physics , like the effect of @xmath55-gradients on convective boundaries , or time - dependent convective energy transport .    the emerging picture ,",
    "that was first fully described by @xcite , is that the vltp evolution is a superposition of two flashes , reflected in the double loop morphology of the hrd track .",
    "the first fast born - again evolution is the result of the h - ingestion flash , whereas the second longer lasting loop is driven by the he - shell flash that is still proceeding at the bottom of the intershell , largely unperturbed .",
    "even more recently , @xcite have presented new calculations of the vltp , that connect the vltp event with the observational properties of pg1159 stars , and db and dq white dwarfs .",
    "these calculations confirm the double - loop picture , and feature a born - again evolution time of @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite investigate the dependence of the born - again times on additional physics , like the convection theory and the @xmath55-gradients , and on numerical aspects , like time resolution .",
    "the born - again time of their best model is @xmath57 without changing the mixing velocity _",
    "ad hoc_. they do confirm the relation between mixing velocity and born - again time of @xcite .      as the discussion in the previous section shows , the more recent stellar evolution studies of the vltp show some agreement ( e.g.  the double - loop structure ) as well as disagreement ( e.g.  the quantitative born - again time scale ) .",
    "all these calculations are based on some assumptions that are well founded in many phases of stellar evolution : spherical symmetry , convection can be described by time - averaged quantities as in mixing - length theory , hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ". however , several or maybe all of these assumptions are invalid for the vltp .",
    "the ingestion of hydrogen into the he - shell flash convection zone is a complicated multi - dimensional problem of turbulent convective - reactive fluid flow in which composition changes and reactive energy release are coupled to the dynamics @xcite .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in the treatment of non - reactive mixing at the h - rich  c - rich interface at the top of the convection zone .",
    "convective rising plumes will perturb this interface , possibly penetrating a small distance .",
    "the perturbation of the boundary layer induces gravity waves @xcite which cause , possibly in the interaction with a small amount of convective penetration , shear flows and thereby turbulent mixing at this interface .",
    "this boundary mixing will be very important because the much lower molecular weight of material in the h - rich stable layer will prevent unmixed blobs to be entrained easily into the he - shell flash convection zone . nevertheless , as any stellar convection simulation shows , including those of the he - shell flash convection of @xcite , the overall convective flow morphology is dominated by structures that have roughly the size of the vertical extent of the convection zone . on these large vertical scales",
    "confined downflows will eventually contain material with a significant h - abundance .",
    "nuclear energy from the @xmath47 reaction is released in localized bursts at the vertical position where the temperature is large enough to reduce the nuclear burning time scale down to the local mixing time scale .",
    "this mixing time scale corresponds to the actual velocity in the downflow , not the rms - averaged value , that corresponds in fact well with the mixing - length velocity .    in most stellar evolution situations the nuclear time scale is much longer than the convective time scale",
    "this justifies the customary operator split between the convective mixing step and the nuclear burning calculation .",
    "it also justifies the assumption that nuclear energy release is isotropic in the horizontal direction ( or on spheres ) .",
    "however , in the h - ingestion flash there are small and irregular parcels of energy production that coincide with the horizontal area of h - rich downflows .",
    "this breaks spherical symmetry .",
    "the bursts of energy will locally add buoyancy and alter the convective flow patterns , deflecting focused downflows sideways or even reversing the flows .",
    "this has its correspondence to the notion derived from 1d models that the energy release from the h - ingestion flash will lead to a split of the convective region associated with an impenetrable entropy barrier . whether or not such a separation of convection zones will actually develop in real stars , and whether the 1d mixing - length theory - based diffusion - burning models can account for this evolution phase at all is uncertain , considering the many unknown aspects of the complicated reactive , turbulent mixing that dominates the above sketched picture of the problem",
    "this picture is based on our preliminary multi - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of the h - ingestion problem .    in view of all these complications",
    "it seems rather surprising that the more recent 1d vltp stellar evolution models agree to some extent with each other , and with the observed evolution of sakurai s object at all .",
    "however , there is room for some doubt whether the current models describe the physics correctly on the level needed to understand the observations .",
    "if the he - shell flash ignites during the earlier horizontal , constant - luminosity evolution the star will follow a born - again evolution but without a hydrogen ingestion flash ( hif ) .",
    "this variant of the post - agb he - shell flash is the late thermal pulse @xcite . although the ltp does not deplete h in the surface layer by nuclear burning it will still develop a h - deficient surface composition @xcite .",
    "this is achieved entirely by mixing .",
    "as the star inflates and the surface becomes cooler , envelope convection , that is characteristic for giant stars , emerges again . at this point a dredge - up event in the same way as following the agb thermal pulses will mix a very thin h - rich envelope layer of the order @xmath58 with a few @xmath59 of h - free intershell layer .",
    "the result is h - deficiency as a result of dilution .",
    "the ltp model of @xcite predicts a h surface mass fraction of @xmath60 .",
    "the ltp has only a single loop back to the agb which proceeds on a long time scale of the order @xmath28 .",
    "in addition there are differences in the abundance evolution resulting from the fact that the ltp did not experience a h - ingestion flash ( sect.[sec : modabund ] ) .",
    "these include no li production , no enhanced @xmath44  abundance , a larger @xmath30 ratio than in the vltp hif models .",
    "unfortunately there are no detailed ltp models including all relevant nucleosynthesis and a realistic treatment of the agb progenitors available .",
    "the born - again scenario may imply that h - deficient cspn should have systematically older pn , which is not the case @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the appeal of the aftp scenario is that it does not require the central star to evolve through a lengthy first cspn phase and the return to the agb and to the cspn again .",
    "the aftp leads to h - deficiency at the last thermal pulse still on the agb . by invoking some fine - tuning of the mass loss the envelope mass at the last agb thermal pulse",
    "is so small that the star leaves the agb immediately after the dredge - up following this last agb thermal pulse . because of this very small envelope mass the dredge - up leads as in the ltp to a significant dilution of the h surface abundance .",
    "the aftp scenario is in contradiction to agb stellar evolution studies of dredge - up towards the end of the agb evolution , which assert that dredge - up stops when the envelope mass falls below a certain value .",
    "for example , a minimum envelope mass of @xmath61 for dredge - up was reported by @xcite . however , dredge - up predictions in stellar evolution models are notoriously dependent on fine - tuning some mixing parameters , like the mixing - length parameter or the overshooting parameter .",
    "the two aftp models of @xcite were calculated with a mixing - length parameter of @xmath62 and overshooting . at the time of the last agb thermal pulse the envelope mass was @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the dredged - up mass was in both cases @xmath65 .",
    "this resulted in h - abundances at the surface of the post - agb star of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this is much larger than the h - abundance observed in pg1159 stars .",
    "however , the aftp model may explain quite naturally the `` hybrid '' pg1159 stars which are h - deficient but yet have h abundances much larger than the typical pg1159 and [ wr]-cspn stars ( tables  [ tababu ] and  [ tabpg1159 ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main problem with the aftp scenario seems to be a missing mechanism that favors the pulse phase zero ( or very small ) for the departure from the agb . somehow , the thermal pulse must trigger enhanced mass loss that in turn enhances the probability of a departure at phase close to zero .",
    "the typical agb mass - loss formulae do not provide such a mechanism and would lead to a very low probability of such an event .",
    "@xcite considered the possibility that swallowing a planet or a very - low mass star companion could eject the star with high probability during the temporary , significant radius increase induced by the thermal pulse .",
    "the multi - dimensional simulations showed that envelope ejection is indeed possible .",
    "this would initialize the departure from the agb .",
    "clearly this interesting possibility needs more investigation , and such efforts are underway .",
    "the evolution tracks of an undisturbed h - normal post - agb evolution ( no - tp ) , an aftp track and a vltp track are compared in fig.[fig : ba - channels ] .",
    "all three tracks have been started from the same tip - agb model that was evolved through all previous evolution phases from a @xmath1 main - sequence model .",
    "the stellar mass at the time of departure from the agb is @xmath14 .",
    "the comparison shows that surface abundance has no effect before the `` knee '' ( the hottest point in the track ) and only a small effect after the knee , where the h - normal track is slightly cooler for a given @xmath68 .",
    "however , this difference should not be overemphasized , because it is largely due to a `` kink '' in the track that reflects the onset of the reignition of the he - shell . in the no - tp track",
    "the he - shell flash run - away does not develop .",
    "for the hrd track after the knee it seems not to matter how the star became h - deficient .",
    "the aftp and the final cspn evolution of the vltp have identical tracks .",
    "this indicates that h - normal cspn tracks can be used as a tool to determine masses from spectroscopic stellar parameters in the absence of a homogeneous grid of h - deficient tracks .",
    "another point that is evident from the comparison of tracks in fig.[fighrd ] seems to be more important for accurate mass determinations .",
    "this figure shows older tracks from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , as well as our newer vltp track that is also shown in fig.[fig : ba - channels ] .",
    "while the @xmath69 track from @xcite and the @xmath70 track from @xcite show good agreement the new @xmath14 track is at and below the knee @xmath71 hotter .",
    "this is even more surprising since the same code ( although with some differences concerning nucleosynthesis and mixing ) has been used for the @xmath72 and the @xmath14 model .",
    "the reason for this hrd track difference is a different dredge - up or mass - loss history or both in the agb progenitor evolution . for the new @xmath14 track the agb progenitor evolution includes a complete sequence of thermal pulses , a large number of which",
    "are followed by third dredge - up mixing events .",
    "these dredge - up events lead to a smaller effective core growth , while the properties of the core itself , in particular the radius , depends to a large extent on the increasing degeneracy of the c / o core @xcite .",
    "if an agb evolution sequence experiences many efficient third dredge - up events the resulting post - agb star appears in the hrd like a slightly more massive star compared to the same core mass post - agb stellar model that has an agb thermal pulse history of inefficient or no dredge - up .",
    "mass loss can have a similar effect because it determines the age of the core for a given initial mass at the tip of the agb @xcite .",
    "this was shown in detail by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* his fig.10 ) who calculated two post - agb tracks with identical mass ( @xmath73 ) , one with a @xmath74 main - sequence progenitor , and one with initially @xmath75 .",
    "in order for the @xmath75 model to reach such a high core mass , a smaller mass - loss rate than for the @xmath74 track was adopted . in this way the core had a long time to grow through shell burning before the envelope loss forced the agb departure .",
    "the result is a more degenerate , more compact , and consequently hotter post - agb stellar model with the @xmath75 progenitor compared to the post - agb model with the @xmath74 progenitor .    in summary ,",
    "if cspn tracks are computed for the purpose of determining masses ( or fading times ) the third dredge - up and the mass loss during the progenitor evolution must be accurately taken into account .",
    "if we interpret h - deficient post - agb stars , like pg1159 stars or [ wc]-cspn as the bare cores of former agb stars exposed by the born - again evolution or an aftp evolution , then the surface abundance of these stars is a superposition of the intershell abundance of the progenitor agb star at the last thermal pulse on the agb and any modification that in particular the violent burning and mixing associated with the h - ingestion flash of the vltp may have caused . in the following",
    "we discuss the surface abundance predictions for the elements that have been observed so far , taking into account both of these contributions .      during the he - shell flash",
    "the triple-@xmath3 reaction that transforms three @xmath37  into one @xmath36  is the dominant source of energy .",
    "the layers immediately below the pdcz contain an amount of @xmath45  from the @xmath76 reaction , increasing with depth .",
    "starting with the earliest models of thermal pulse agb stars @xcite it has been consistently found that without convective extra mixing the @xmath45  abundance is 0.010.02 , and the @xmath36  abundance is 0.20.25 in the intershell with the remaining @xmath77 @xmath37 .",
    "more recently models with convective extra mixing in the form of a parameterized exponential overshoot at the bottom of the pdcz have been constructed @xcite .",
    "these models agree quantitatively that such extra mixing leads to a systematically larger @xmath45  and @xmath36abundance in the pdcz .",
    "@xcite showed that the efficiency of convective extra mixing is proportional to the intershell @xmath45  abundance .",
    "in addition , there is an evolution of the @xmath45  abundance with pulse number , initially rising , then reaching a maximum value after a few thermal pulses and decreasing towards a plateau at the last thermal pulses . for the evolution sequence with",
    "@xcite finds at the last computed thermal pulse an intershell abundance of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for a sequence with initially @xmath80 @xcite find @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "presumably this difference is due to the smaller number of thermal pulses in @xcite compared to @xcite . as mentioned above the @xmath45   intershell abundance goes through a maximum ( corresponding to a minimum for @xmath37 ) before approaching a plateau .",
    "the @xcite intershell abundance may correspond to a thermal pulse closer to that maximum .",
    "nitrogen is produced in agb stars by h - shell burning on envelope material enriched by carbon dredge - up after previous thermal pulses . in low - mass",
    "agb stars the h - burning shell burns most cno material in the envelope material it consumes , into @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the h - shell burning ashes ( see fig.[fig : kipp ] ) contain with each dredge - up pulse more @xmath44 , that is mixed in the next he - shell flash convection zone . in the he - burning shell during the flash this @xmath44  is destroyed and forms @xmath83  and @xmath39  ( see below ) .",
    "the models predict that the intershell of agb stars at the end of their evolution is practically free of @xmath44 .    in massive agb stars",
    "@xmath44  is produced in the envelopes by hot - bottom burning @xcite .",
    "the dredged - up carbon in the envelope is transformed by two p - captures into @xmath44  because part of the h - burning shell is included in the convective envelope .",
    "therefore , we expect in the more massive post - agb stars of roughly solar metallicity a nitrogen mass fraction of @xmath84% to maybe a few @xmath85 in the h - rich envelope at the time of departure from the agb .",
    "the nitrogen evolution is different for the ltp and vltp .",
    "the ltp will only dilute some intershell material with the remaining small amount of envelope material .",
    "even if the progenitor has evolved through the hot - bottom burning phase , the nitrogen abundance will be at most roughly @xmath86 .",
    "if the star evolves through a vltp , nitrogen is produced by the h - ingestion and may be as high as a few @xmath85 .",
    "the absence or presence of n should be a reliable indicator of a ltp or vltp event .      during each interpulse phase the h - shell builds a layer of ashes , that is engulfed into the following pdcz .",
    "these h - shell ashes contain mainly @xmath37 , with an important modification of the cno abundances .",
    "all cno , be it from the stellar initial abundance or dredged - up after a previous thermal pulse , will be mostly transformed into @xmath44 .",
    "this @xmath44  is exposed to the high he - burning temperature ( @xmath87 ) where two @xmath3 captures lead to the formation of @xmath83  first and then @xmath39 .",
    "depending on mass some @xmath39   is destroyed by the neutron producing reaction @xmath38 . for low - mass agb stars with initial masses around @xmath88",
    "the @xmath39  depletion is only small ( @xmath89 ) because the peak temperature at the base of the pdcz is not reaching high enough values @xmath90 .",

    "will be reduced by neutron capture and transformed into ni if the @xmath39  neutron source is active , i.e. @xmath40reduction will be more efficient in higher core - mass agb stars . however , as it is the case for many other species , the evolution of @xmath40  in the intershell with increasing pulse number depends sensitively on the dredge - up history , which in turn seems in model calculations to be related to assumptions about convective extra mixing @xcite .",
    "preliminary models by @xcite show that the @xmath40  depletion in the pdcz at the last thermal pulse of a @xmath75 star varies significantly depending on stellar evolution model assumptions . for a thermal pulse agb sequence with convective extra",

    "an additional depletion of fe and production of ni may be obtained during the late thermal pulse ( sect.[sec : vltp ] ) . in any case , the unmistakable signature of fe depletion due to n - capture nucleosynthesis is the simultaneous increase of ni , and correspondingly a decrease of the fe / ni ratio . while the solar ratio is about 20 , material that has experienced a significant neutron exposure would show a ratio closer to the  quasi steady - state of @xmath94 .",
    "@xcite have observed high enhancements of fluorine in agb stars .",
    "they found a correlation of f enhancement and c / o ratio , which is a strong indication that f is produced in the intershell and mixed to the surface during the third dredge - up .",
    "observations show that thermal pulses cause a 10-fold increase in @xmath95 .",
    "the nucleosynthesis path to @xmath95  first involves the production of @xmath96  which requires a neutron source : @xmath97 .",
    "this chain of reaction occurs during the interpulse phase .",
    "the neutrons are provided both by @xmath42  in the h - shell ashes , and in the @xmath42  pocket . for a certain range of mixing efficiencies ,",

    "the variation from pulse to pulse means that a quantitative comparison with observed @xmath95  values in h - deficient post - agb stars depends on details of the entire agb evolution , including for example an accurate description of mass loss and dredge - up to correctly model the total number of thermal pulses .",

    "these three elements have a too high coulomb barrier to be altered by charged particle reactions in agb stars .",

    "however , the elemental abundance of si is dominated by the lightest isotope , @xmath111 , which in the solar abundance distribution accounts for approximately @xmath112 of the elemental si abundance .",
    "neutron exposure in agb stars will shift a small fraction of @xmath111to @xmath113  and @xmath114 , but the elemental abundance changes only very little in the he intershell of agb stars .",
    "therefore , a solar si abundance is expected in hot h - deficient post - agb stars .    for p the model calculation with",
    "initially @xmath75 predicts an enhancement in the intershell at the end of the agb that is sensitive to the assumptions about convective extra mixing .",
    "the expected range is from four times solar without extra mixing to @xmath115 times solar with extra mixing . as discussed in sect.[sec : cem ] the respective mixing algorithm contains a free efficiency parameter .",
    "we consider the efficiency chosen in this model an upper boundary .",
    "as it is the case for @xmath95 , the he - shell flash nucleosynthesis can be sensitive to the initial mass .",
    "a systematic evaluation of the p intershell abundance as a function of mass and metallicity is not yet available .",
    "the same models predict a small deficiency in s in the intershell at the end of the agb , ranging from 0.6 times solar with convective extra mixing to 0.9 times solar for the standard model .",
    "a more systematic evaluation of the intershell abundance evolution of s and p should include the neutron capture cross section uncertainties .",
    "however , in general the uncertainties for these stable isotopes are typically less than @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "although li can not be observed in hot post - agb stars , the observed li overabundance in sakurai s object is an important hint .",
    "the production of this fragile element in the form of its heavy isotope @xmath117  is usually associated with hot - bottom burning in massive agb stars @xcite .",
    "enhanced extra mixing in red giant branch stars induced by tidal synchronization or swallowing of a giant planet has been proposed as another source of @xmath117  @xcite .",
    "both of these production sites are based on the @xmath118  transport processes .",
    "@xmath119  and @xmath37form @xmath118  which becomes @xmath117  through a largely temperature insensitive @xmath120-capture on a time - scale of approximately one year .",
    "if the production region of @xmath118  is convectively connected to cooler layers , like in envelope convection that reaches into the h - burning shell in hot - bottom burning , then @xmath118  is transported out of the hot layers , and the resulting @xmath117  can survive , because it is not immediately destroyed by @xmath121-captures .",
    "@xcite have shown that if @xmath119  in the envelope has not been destroyed by one of the two processes mentioned above ( which is likely for most low - mass agb stars with initial masses below @xmath122 ) , then copious amounts of @xmath117  can be produced in the hydrogen ingestion flash .",
    "they refer to this process as hot h - deficient @xmath119  burning .",
    "the reason is somewhat different from the @xmath118  transport mechanism , in which @xmath118  is transported out of the hot p - rich , and therefore @xmath117  hostile environment quickly enough . in the hif",
    "the amount of ingested h is strictly limited , and in addition to h , @xmath119  is ingested into the he - shell flash convection zone .",
    "this @xmath119  quickly reacts with @xmath37  and forms @xmath118 , which then has to wait for an @xmath120 capture to become @xmath117 .",
    "this waiting period is long enough for all the protons to be rapidly consumed by @xmath36 . by",
    "the time @xmath117  appears no protons are available anymore for li destruction , leading to a net production of @xmath117 .",
    "current models only account qualitatively for the processes involved . in a one - zone model @xcite",
    "find a maximum mass fraction of @xmath123 , which corresponds to @xmath124 more than the solar system meteoritic value .",
    "we expect that the surface overabundance of li in a realistic multi - zone model would be much smaller .",
    "@xmath117  production in a hif has been recently confirmed by @xcite in the context of he - shell flashes in extremely metal - poor agb stars . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite in fact originally proposed the @xmath118  transport mechanism motivated by the first hif models by @xcite that were , however , not reproduced by subsequent models that included radiation pressure .",
    "in the previous sections  [ observation ] and [ theory ] we have presented in detail the element abundances observed in pg1159 and [ wc ] stars as well as the the surface abundances predicted from stellar evolution models . how do they compare ?",
    "hydrogen : the observed h deficiency is in accordance with evolution models of the born - again scenario . in the vltp models h is ingested and burned and disappears completely .",
    "an ltp event causes mixing of the h - rich envelope with the intershell so that h is diluted down to a mass fraction of the order 0.02 .",
    "this is close to the observational limit .",
    "the relatively high h abundances in the hybrid - pg1159 stars and some [ wc ] stars ( of the order 0.15 ) are explained by aftp models .",
    "helium , carbon and oxygen : these are the main constituents of the intershell region of agb stars and the model abundances generally agree with the observed abundances in pg1159 and [ wc ] stars .",
    "the spread of observed relative he / c / o ratios can in part be explained by differences in stellar mass and the different number of thermal pulses experienced by objects even with equal total mass ( the latter being a consequence of potentially different agb mass - loss , for example as a result of rotation ) . however , we think that some few extreme cases of he / c / o ratios remain unexplained , in particular objects with relatively low o abundance ( of order 0.01 ) and simultaneously high c abundance ( of order 0.5 ) . one speculative scenario has been sketched by @xcite .",
    "if the agb star has a low - mass stellar or planetary companion at a distance of 12  au it would be engulfed during the radius peak induced by the first thermal pulse .",
    "the transfer of orbital energy into the agb envelope may eject the envelope and lead to a departure from the agb . according to @xcite the intershell o abundance is very low after the first thermal pulse even if overshooting has been applied . if such an evolution later involves a vltp or ltp , a pg1159 star with a very low o abundance would result .",
    "a similar evolution could result from a low - mass star that naturally leaves the agb just before the first thermal pulse @xcite .",
    "nitrogen : the observations show a wide range of n abundance , from very low upper limits ( @xmath125 in hs1517 + 7403 ) to mass fractions of @xmath126 , in agreement with predictions for ltp and vltp evolution , respectively . intermediate abundance levels could in some cases be associated with higher stellar mass .",
    "fluorine : the rich diversity of f abundances observed in pg1159 stars ( from solar up to 250 times solar ) is explained by models with different stellar mass leading to different f production efficiencies .",
    "silicon : the si abundance in the evolution models is almost unchanged so that a solar abundance is expected .",
    "only few abundance analyses are available .",
    "pg1159 stars display the expected si abundance while surprisingly strong overabundances ( up to 40 times solar ) were found in some [ wcl ] stars .",
    "phosphorus : theoretical predictions and observational data are scarce .",
    "current models are consistent with p overabundances of up to 425 times solar . preliminary results from two pg1159 stars indicate roughly solar abundances .",
    "sulfur : preliminary abundance determinations in pg1159 stars suggest a wide spread , ranging between 0.011 times solar .",
    "these results need to be confirmed by further analyses . like in the case of p ,",
    "systematic investigations with evolution models are lacking , but current models predict only slight ( 0.6 solar ) s depletion .",
    "lithium : the li abundance can not be determined in hot objects so that no conclusions can be drawn from pg1159 and [ wc ] stars .",
    "sakurai s object , however , shows a large li abundance . as discussed in previous sections this li",
    "can not have survived from an earlier phase , and is a strong additional hint that sakurai s object did in fact evolve through a vltp .    iron and nickel : the observed fe deficiency in pg1159 and [ wc ] stars is explained by neutron captures on @xmath127fe .",
    "the consequent increase of the ni abundance can not be confirmed or contradicted with current observational material .",
    "however , sakurai s object indeed exhibits a strongly subsolar fe / ni ratio , that is quantitatively in agreement with model estimates .    to conclude , element abundances predicted by born - again evolutionary models ( ltp and vltp case ) as well as the agb final thermal pulse models ( aftp case ) can explain most observational results from pg1159 and [ wc ] star analyses .",
    "the model surface abundances largely reflect the intershell abundance of the agb progenitor . from the good qualitative and quantitative agreement between observed and predicted abundances",
    "we conclude that [ wc ] and pg1159 stars generally display on their surface the intershell material of the agb progenitor . for this reason",
    ", detailed quantitative spectroscopic investigations of these hot post - agb stars can be used as a tool to study the nuclear production site of the he - intershell in agb stars .",
    "such a tool is in particular useful because the agb interior is otherwise obviously inaccessible to direct observation .",
    "it is hoped that new observations and analyses of these h - deficient post - agb stars will contribute to an even more complete picture of the nuclear astrophysics processes in agb stars .",
