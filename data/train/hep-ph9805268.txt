    "in view of counterexamples @xcite to the conjecture of factorization @xcite of hard processes in diffractive scattering , it is important to test @xcite factorization experimentally . in this paper",
    ", we present some results to this end .",
    "specifically , we present fits to data from the zeus and h1 collaborations on diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite and on diffractive photoproduction of jets @xcite .",
    "then we use these fits to predict cross sections in hard diffractive processes in @xmath2 collisions , with the assumption of factorization ; we find that the predictions fail badly .",
    "we recall that diffractive events are characterized by a large rapidity gap , a region in rapidity where no particles are produced .",
    "we are concerned with the case where there is a hard scattering and where the gap occurs between the hard scattering and one of the beam remnants .",
    "such hard diffractive events are observed in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments @xcite and are found to have a large rate : around 10% of the inclusive cross section .",
    "diffractive jet production in @xmath2 collisions was earlier reported by the ua8 collaboration @xcite , but under somewhat different kinematic conditions ( larger @xmath3 ) we mean the invariant momentum - transfer - squared from the diffracted hadron . ] .",
    "there was also a report of diffractive bottom production @xcite .",
    "now , more diffractive data are being gathered from a variety of lepto - hadronic @xcite and hadronic processes @xcite , but with substantially smaller fractions in the case of the diffractive production of jets and weak vector bosons in @xmath2 interactions than in dis .",
    "factorization for diffractive hard scattering is equivalent to the hard - scattering aspects of the ingelman and schlein model @xcite , where diffractive scattering is attributed to the exchange of a pomeron  a colorless object with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "ingelman and schlein treat the pomeron like a real particle , and so they consider that a diffractive electron - proton collision is due to an electron - pomeron collision and that a diffractive proton - proton collision is due to a proton - pomeron collision .",
    "therefore they propose that diffractive hard cross sections are obtained as a product of a hard - scattering coefficient ( or wilson coefficient ) , a known pomeron - proton coupling , and parton densities in the pomeron .",
    "as was already known @xcite before the advent of qcd , factorization is not expected to hold in general for diffractive hard processes .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of a breakdown of the triple - regge theory for soft single - diffractive excitation , goulianos has proposed @xcite to renormalize the pomeron flux in an energy - dependent way .",
    "the agreement between data and his calculated cross sections is evidence that hard - scattering factorization is likely to break down in diffractive hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "however , one of us has recently proved factorization @xcite for those diffractive hard processes that are lepton induced : these include diffractive dis and diffractive _ direct _ photoproduction of jets .",
    "the proof fails for hadron - induced processes . in this formulation ,",
    "the primary non - perturbative quantities are diffractive parton densities @xcite in the proton .",
    "although we will use the terminology of `` parton densities in the pomeron '' , this mainly gives a useful way to describe the kind of parameterization we use for the diffractive parton densities , together with an indication of the quantum numbers that we believe to be exchanged across the rapidity gap .",
    "there is no necessary requirement that the object we call the pomeron is the same as in soft scattering .    in principle",
    ", the parton densities in the pomeron can be extracted from diffractive dis @xmath4 measurements alone .",
    "since the pomeron is isosinglet and is its own charge conjugate , there is only a single light quark density to measure ; one does not have the complications of separating the different flavors of quark that one has in the case of the parton densities of the proton .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the structure functions enables one to determine the gluon density .",
    "the h1 collaboration has already presented @xcite a fit of this kind .",
    "this type of data sufficiently determines the quark density in the pomeron , and the h1 fits suggest a large gluon content for the pomeron .",
    "however , a more direct measurement of the gluons can be made in photoproduction , since the leading order processes have both quark- and gluon - induced terms .",
    "the zeus collaboration has already presented experimental evidence for a large gluon content of the pomeron ; they performed a combined analysis of their results on the diffractive structure function in deep inelastic scattering @xcite and on diffractive jet photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the main result of the zeus work was information on the overall normalization of the diffractive parton densities . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to obtain more detailed fits including the h1 data , and to use the resulting fits to predict other cross sections .",
    "we use data on both dis and photoproduction .",
    "recently , the zeus collaboration has reported @xcite new fits to their data that are made independently , but in a similar fashion to ours .    for fitting the dis data , we use full next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations .",
    "the use of nlo rather than lo calculations is important since the gluon density is larger than the quark density . for the photoproduction data , we use leading - order calculations in a monte - carlo event generator in order to implement the experimental cuts .",
    "the event generator was constructed by two of us @xcite as an extension to the pompyt generator to allow the use of evolved parton densities in the pomeron . with the resulting diffractive parton densities",
    "we calculate hard diffractive processes in hadron - hadron collisions , given the assumption of factorization .    in the past ,",
    "ingelman and schlein @xcite and bruni and ingelman @xcite have made similar calculations for one of the hadron - induced processes that we consider here ( @xmath6 production ) .",
    "their results have provided a commonly used benchmark in the phenomenology of these processes .",
    "they provide a choice of either `` hard '' or `` soft '' distributions of partons in the pomeron , according to the @xmath7 behavior .",
    "is the fraction of the pomeron s momentum that is carried by the struck parton . ] the hard distributions give larger diffractive cross sections .",
    "at that time , there were no data to determine the distributions .",
    "we will find that although the quark distributions preferred by the dis data are hard , our cross sections are substantially below those predicted by bruni and ingelman .",
    "we will present an analysis of the reasons for the lower values that we find .",
    "nevertheless , our predictions for hadron - induced cross sections are well above the measurements @xcite , for both @xmath0 production and jet production . in the case of jet production ,",
    "the excess only occurs because of the large gluon density that is strongly preferred by the photoproduction data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "fits ] , we show our fits to diffractive deep inelastic and photoproduction data . in section [ sec : kin ]",
    ", we present some details of the formulae used to calculate the cross sections in hadron - hadron processes , and we discuss the kinematics and phase - space cuts that we used . then in sections [ sec : vb.calcs ] and [ sec : jet.calcs ] , we present and discuss the results obtained for vector boson production and jet production , respectively . finally , we summarize our findings in section [ sec : concl ]",
    ".    other fits to the diffractive structure functions measured by h1 have been made by gehrmann and stirling @xcite and by kunszt and stirling @xcite .",
    "golec - biernat and kwieciski @xcite assumed a parameterization of the parton densities in the pomeron and found it to be compatible with the h1 data on diffractive dis .",
    "their quark densities are about 30% smaller than ours , and they required the momentum sum rule to be valid .",
    "the new features of our work are a fit to a wider range of data , including photoproduction , the lack of an assumption of the momentum sum rule , and a calculation of the cross sections for diffractive jet and @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , so as to test factorization by comparison with data from the cdf and d0 experiments .",
    "we will present a series of fits of parton densities in the pomeron to data on diffractive dis and diffractive photoproduction of jets .",
    "there are four sets of data that we use :    * dis data obtained by zeus using the rapidity gap method@xcite ; * dis data obtained by zeus using their leading proton spectrometer ( lps ) @xcite ; * dis data obtained by h1 using the rapidity gap method@xcite ; and * photoproduction data obtained by zeus using the rapidity gap method@xcite .",
    "diffractive structure functions are related to the differential cross section for the process @xmath8 : @xmath9 f_{2}^{d(4 ) }          - y^{2 } f_{l}^{d(4 ) }       \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where corrections due to @xmath10 exchange and due to radiative corrections have been ignored . here",
    "@xmath11 is the fractional momentum loss of the diffracted proton ( in the sense of light - cone momentum ) , and @xmath12 is the invariant momentum transfer for the diffracted proton .",
    "the variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the usual dis variables , and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the usual bjorken scaling variable of dis .    except for the zeus lps data ,",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath12 is not measured , so we make fits to the structure function integrated over @xmath12 , and write the structure function in the form : @xmath17 ( we have set the lower limit on @xmath12 to @xmath18 to avoid including contributions where the putative diffracted proton results from fragmentation of a high @xmath19 jet . this point should not be important at small @xmath20 . moreover , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq.dlflux ] ) is steeply falling in @xmath12 so that the contributions to the integral from the region @xmath21 are quite small . )",
    "we next use hard - scattering factorization , proved in @xcite , to write the diffractive structure function in terms of diffractive parton densities and hard - scattering coefficients : @xmath22 an equation valid to the leading power in @xmath5 .",
    "the hard - scattering coefficients are the same as in ordinary inclusive dis .",
    "the predictive power of this equation comes from the dglap evolution equation obeyed by the parton densities and from the universality of the parton densities : they can be used to predict the cross sections for certain other diffractive hard processes .",
    "factorization also holds for the diffractive structure function differential in @xmath12 .",
    "we now assume that @xmath20 is small .",
    "it is therefore sensible to use a parameterization of the @xmath20 dependence that is motivated by regge theory .",
    "if regge factorization is valid , then the dependence on @xmath20 is of the form given by regge theory , and therefore can be represented by a pomeron flux factor , @xmath23 , that is related to the pomeron - proton coupling measured in proton - proton elastic scattering .",
    "we do not necessarily expect regge factorization to be valid .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume that a suitable parameterization of the @xmath20-dependence is of the regge form , but possibly with different parameters than in proton - proton elastic scattering .",
    "if this form is not suitable , then we will find that we can not fit the data , and a more general parameterization is needed .",
    "this can happen even though hard - scattering factorization remains valid in the form , ( [ dis.factorization ] ) , proved in ref .  @xcite .",
    "so we will write the diffractive parton densities as a pomeron flux factor times what are termed parton densities in the pomeron : @xmath24 furthermore we will assume the pomeron flux factor is of the donnachie - landshoff ( dl ) @xcite form : @xmath25^{2}x_{\\pomeron}^{1 - 2\\alpha ( t ) } , \\label{dlflux}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the proton mass , @xmath27 is the pomeron - quark coupling and @xmath28 is the pomeron trajectory .",
    "we treat @xmath29 as a parameter of our fits , instead of using the value given by donnachie and landshoff .",
    "up to logarithmic corrections , the flux factor integrated over @xmath12 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant .",
    "the @xmath12-dependence of the dl flux factor is not used in any of our fits , so the only use we make of the @xmath12 dependence in eq.([dlflux ] ) is to give a convention for a normalization factor that is convenient for comparisons with other work .",
    "there is in fact another pomeron flux factor that is commonly used , that of ingelman and schlein ( is ) @xcite .",
    "this differs from the dl flux factor primarily in its normalization .",
    "since the same normalization factor appears in all our cross sections , its value is irrelevant to our phenomenology .",
    "any change in the normalization factor is completely compensated by changing the parton densities by an inverse factor , and we obtain the parton densities from fitting a set of data without any _ a priori _ expectations as to their normalization .",
    "however , the normalization does affect the question of whether the momentum sum rule is obeyed by the parton densities in the pomeron .",
    "since it is not at present understood whether the sum rule is a theorem , this issue will not affect us .",
    "the momentum sum rule is _ not _ assumed in any of our fits .",
    "we will use regge theory to make one further ( correctable ) assumption ; this is , in effect , that the pomeron has a definite charge conjugation parity and is an isosinglet .",
    "this implies that the distributions of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 quarks are equal .",
    "such an assumption is also valid in simple models where the rapidity gap is generated by gluon exchange .",
    "one possible mechanism for violation of the equality of the light parton densities would be the existence of an odderon , which has opposite charge conjugation to the pomeron .",
    "the existence of pomeron - odderon interference would break the equality of the quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "we will ignore this possibility , since there is no convincing phenomenological evidence to persuade us of the odderon s existence .",
    "we also note that the issue does not concern us in dis and photoproduction , since the hard - scattering coefficients are the same for quarks and antiquarks ; in effect we will measure the average of the quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "odderon contributions would only matter when we make predictions for diffractive cross sections at the tevatron .    in the data obtained using the rapidity gap method @xcite",
    ", the outgoing proton is not detected .",
    "such data include `` double - dissociative '' contributions where the proton is excited to a state that escapes down the beam - pipe and thus , misses the detector .",
    "factorization works for such final states , but since we will also wish to fit data where the outgoing proton is detected , we prefer to correct the data to remove the double - dissociative contribution . in the case of the zeus rapidity gap data @xcite , excited states up to about 4 gev pass the diffraction selection cuts , and it is estimated that there is a contribution of @xmath36 to the measured diffractive @xmath37 from double - dissociative events . in obtaining our fits ,",
    "we have corrected the relevant zeus data to take this into account . for the case of photoproduction data",
    ", we make the corresponding corrections for double dissociation and for nondiffractive contributions as well .",
    "no corrections have been made to the h1 diffractive @xmath38 data for which excited states up to 1.6 gev are included .",
    "this point is relevant when we compare predictions obtained using our fits to data where the diffracted proton is detected ( as in sect .",
    "[ sec : jet.calcs ] ) and also when we later compare our fits to both zeus and h1 data .",
    "similar formulae apply to photoproduction . for the direct diffractive photoproduction of a jet , @xmath39 , we let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be the transverse energy and pseudorapidity of the jet .",
    "then the cross section is @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the hard - scattering coefficient for the production of a jet in the collision of a photon and a parton of type @xmath44 .",
    "it is the same as in inclusive photoproduction .",
    "the pomeron flux factor @xmath45 and the parton densities in the pomeron are the same as in the previous section .",
    "the proof @xcite of the factorization theorem indicates that factorization is valid for the direct part but probably not for the resolved part of diffractive photoproduction of jets .",
    "fortunately , most of the cross section is from the direct process .",
    "this is known from the experimental data @xcite , and is also verified by our monte - carlo calculations . for the kinematic configurations of the data , we find a direct contribution that is 2 to 4.5 times larger than the resolved contribution , except at @xmath46 , where the two terms are comparable in size .",
    "if we use the factorization formula to calculate cross sections for diffractive photoproduction , then presumably we should multiply the resolved contribution to the cross section by a correction factor similar to the one needed in hadron - hadron scattering ( secs.[sec : vb.calcs ] and [ sec : jet.calcs ] ) .",
    "given the dominance of the direct contribution and the low precision of the current data  fig .",
    "[ photo.fits ]  we feel that this is an unnecessary refinement in the present work .    beyond leading order ,",
    "the separation between the resolved and direct processes is not unambiguous .",
    "again , at the level of accuracy of the present data , we think that this is not an important enough issue to affect our results .",
    "as far as the dis data are concerned , we restrict our attention to the subset of the data that is in the truly diffractive region .",
    "so we now explain the criteria we use to select the data for our fits .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define the diffractive component of a cross section to be the part of the cross section corresponding to the leading - power @xmath20-dependence , of the form in eq.([pomeron.power ] ) . with this definition of diffraction ,",
    "the cross sections reported by the zeus experiment @xcite are the diffractive components .",
    "we do not need to address the question of whether the power dependence we use , with @xmath47 around 1.1 or 1.2 , is the ultimate asymptotic behavior as @xmath48 .",
    "we also do not require that this power be the same as in soft diffraction .",
    "it is sufficient that the power law represents an adequate approximation to a measurable part of the cross section , given that the factorization theorem @xcite applies quite generally , and not just at small @xmath20 .",
    "this in fact implies that our restriction to diffractive data is mainly a matter of convenience , to reduce the number of parameters , and to be in a region of @xmath20 common to the four sets of data to which we make fits .",
    "the h1 data @xcite include both non - diffractive and diffractive components , as is evidenced by the experiment s fit to their data with two powers of @xmath20 . to restrict our own fit to the diffractive region",
    ", we imposed the following cuts on all the dis data : at @xmath49 or 0.2 , we require @xmath50 , at @xmath51 or 0.4 , we require @xmath52 , and at @xmath53 , we require @xmath54 .",
    "we estimated these cuts by examining where the power - law associated with the pomeron dominates h1 s fits to the @xmath20 dependence .",
    "the h1 data at @xmath55 and @xmath56 are eliminated from our fits by this criterion .",
    "another significant constraint is that we must restrict our fits to the truly deep - inelastic region . outside of this region , the leading - twist qcd factorization theorem for dis does not hold .",
    "in fact some of the h1 data lie very much in the resonance region .",
    "for example , they have points at @xmath57 and @xmath58 . there",
    "the invariant mass of the excited hadronic system is @xmath59 , i.e. , close to the @xmath60 resonance .",
    "while there are perturbative qcd results that apply in this region , they certainly do not include the usual inclusive factorization formula , eq .",
    "( [ dis.factorization ] ) .",
    "most of h1 s data at @xmath61 are at low @xmath62 , while the data at smaller @xmath63 have @xmath62 greater than about 2 gev .",
    "therefore we have simply chosen to discard the @xmath61 data when we make our fits .",
    "with these cuts , the set of data which we fit comprises 77 points , of which 22 are from zeus dis data obtained with the rapidity gap method @xcite , 3 from zeus dis data from its lps @xcite , 48 from h1 dis data @xcite , and 4 from the zeus photoproduction data @xcite .",
    "these subsets of data we will call `` zeus f2d3 '' , `` zeus lps '' , `` h1 f2d3 '' , and `` zeus photo '' , respectively .",
    "the region in which we make the fits is shown in figs .",
    "[ h1.fits ] , [ zeus.fits ] and [ photo.fits ] below , which compare our fits to the data used to make the fits .",
    "each of our fits is represented by a parameterization of the initial distributions at @xmath64 for the @xmath32 , @xmath65 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 quarks and for the gluon .",
    "the other quark distributions are assumed to be zero at this scale .",
    "for the dis cross sections , we used full nlo calculations ( with full evolution and with the number of flavors set equal to 3 ) , while for the photoproduction cross sections , we used a version of pompyt that two of us have constructed @xcite , with the same evolved parton distributions as we used for dis .",
    "the factorization and renormalization scheme is @xmath66 here and throughout this paper . as stated above",
    ", the pomeron flux factor is of the donnachie - landshoff form eq .",
    "( [ dlflux ] ) , but with an adjustable parameter for @xmath47 , and we did not assume a momentum sum rule for the parton densities in the pomeron , so that the choice of normalization for the flux factor is irrelevant .",
    "the fits were made by minimizing @xmath67 , with the experimental systematic errors being added in quadrature to the statistical errors ; no attempt was made to handle point - to - point correlated errors .",
    "the program used to perform the evolution was that of cteq @xcite .",
    "we tried five functional forms for the parton densities , which we label a , b , c , d , and sg . for each of these five forms ( eqs.([paramabcd ] ) and ( [ paramsg ] ) , below )",
    ", we present the values of the parameters that give the best fit , given in turn each of the following three values of @xmath47 :    * @xmath68 , which represents an appropriate value for a conventional pomeron , as seen in soft scattering ; * @xmath69 , which approximates the best value of @xmath47 associated with any of the parameterizations except d ; and * @xmath70 , which gives the best fit associated with parameterization d.    since it is time - consuming to generate monte - carlo events for the photoproduction process and since the number of photoproduction data is small , we first made some preliminary fits to dis data alone to determine suitable values for @xmath47 , as listed above . since the @xmath67 is not strongly dependent on @xmath47 , this seems to us to be sufficient .",

    "however the cross sections for @xmath0 production with fit d exceed those with fit a by a substantially larger factor , particularly at @xmath198 , where the cross section is more than a factor 2 higher .",
    "this arises because of evolution : the large gluon distribution in fit d increases the quark distribution at @xmath199 compared with the case without the large gluon distribution .",
    "the increased quark density is most pronounced at small fractional momentum .",
    "thus the effect is larger at @xmath200 than at @xmath201 , since in the first case , the quark from the pomeron that makes the @xmath0 has a smaller fractional momentum relative to the pomeron .",

    "the rates from fit d ( using nlo values ) are 6.9% ( 6.1% ) for @xmath197 production .",
    "these rates agree with those obtained by kunszt and stirling @xcite with their model 2 for diffractive parton distributions .    the data from which our fits were extracted used a conservative cut on the pomeron momentum , @xmath202 .",
    "the pomeron flux factor allows for the @xmath11 dependence , but to ensure maximum compatibility with the hera data without the assumption of standard regge behavior , the same cut should be applied to the cross sections in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "this results in the cross sections in table [ table : diffwz0.01 ] , which therefore represent our most accurate prediction of diffractive @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , given only the assumption of hard - scattering factorization , _ which of course we wish to test_. notice that with this cut the diffractive cross sections are over an order of magnitude smaller than with @xmath184 .",

    "the large reduction is due to the fact that we are not far from an effective kinematic limit : the cut on @xmath11 gives a maximum proton - pomeron energy of 180 gev , and partons typically do not carry the whole of the energy of their parent hadrons .",

    "for example , the diffractive fraction for @xmath0 production computed using fit a , is six times smaller than bruni and ingelman s fraction ( see table  [ table : fractions ] ) .",
    "since bruni and ingelman s work served as an initial benchmark for subsequent work , it is interesting to understand the sources of this factor .",
    "we first address fit a , since that is our parameterization that is closest to bruni and ingelman s .",
    "the factor between the diffractive rates arises as an accumulation of several modest factors :    * a factor 0.9 because of the use of the cteq4 m instead of the obsolete ehlq1 distributions in the proton .",
    "( the denominator in the ratio of diffractive to inclusive cross sections increases by more than the numerator . ) * a factor 0.7 for the effect of the evolution of the parton densities in the pomeron . * a factor 1.7 for the use of the donnachie - landshoff flux factor instead of the ingelman - schlein flux factor , when the momentum sum is kept fixed . we have found that this factor arises from the following : * * a factor of 2.5 to allow for our larger value of @xmath47 . * * a factor of 0.7 to allow for the effects of the pomeron slope @xmath205 . * a factor 0.16 because the dis data indicate that the quarks have a momentum sum substantially less than the value of unity that was assumed by bruni and ingelman . , which increases the cross sections at small @xmath20 . ]",
    "the first three factors in fact cancel .",
    "so one possible view is that the smallness of our results compared with those of bruni and ingelman arises essentially because of the change in the momentum sum of the quarks required by a fit to the data .",
    "an alternative view arises when one observes that the pomeron - proton coupling is obtained by fitting data on high energy scattering , and that if one increases @xmath47 , then the value of the pomeron - proton coupling has to be decreased to keep the cross section at some particular energy fixed .",
    "( of course , the energy dependence of the cross section would not be fitted so well . )",
    "the variable in high - energy scattering that corresponds to @xmath206 for hard diffraction is @xmath207 .",
    "now , the typical value of @xmath20 in the data that we fit is about @xmath208 , which corresponds to @xmath209 , i.e. , a fixed target energy of around @xmath210 .",
    "therefore it is possible to argue that the factor of 2.5 for the larger value of @xmath47 should be combined with the factor of 0.16 for the momentum sum , to produce a factor of 0.4 for the momentum sum with the pomeron - proton coupling fixed at a value appropriate for fixed - target cern and fermilab experiments .",
    "the overall reduction in our rates compared with those of bruni and ingelman then arises as a product of several factors , all less than unity .    the effects of this decrease in cross section in going from the bruni - ingelman ansatz to our fitted distribution a are then somewhat compensated by the effects of the large gluon distribution we find in fit d.      in this section , we present our results for @xmath0 production , but now with cuts on the emitted lepton @xmath211 . specifically , we calculate the electron s ( or positron s ) rapidity @xmath212 distribution from eq .",

    "the differences between the cross sections reflect first the size of the quark densities and then , in fits b , d and sg , the effects of a large gluon distribution on the evolution of the quark distribution .",

    "our negative value for the soft quark term in fit d is worrying ; note that it is driven by the h1 data , as can be seen from the @xmath67 values in table [ chi2.table ] .",
