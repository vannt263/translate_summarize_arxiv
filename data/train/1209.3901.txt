    "the strangeness production from various scattering processes plays an important role in understanding the microscopic mechanism of the strong interaction beyond the chiral limit @xmath8 and extends our knowledge into multi - strangeness particles . in the present talk",
    ", we would like to report theoretical studies on the @xmath9 photoproduction off the proton target , i.e. @xmath10 . there have been two experimental data from the clas collaboration at jefferson laboratory  @xcite and the taps collaboration at cbelsa  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies are also carried out based on the effective lagrangian method  @xcite and chiral quark model  @xcite . in the present work for the @xmath11 process",
    ", we employ the effective lagrangian method at the tree - level born approximation , including the @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonance contributions , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams preserving the gauge invariance are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in which @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 indicate the nucleon , @xmath6 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively . the strong coupling constants for the ground - state baryons @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , are determined by experimental information  @xcite as well as the nijmegen soft - core potential model ( nsc97a )  @xcite . as for the strong couplings for the baryon resonances",
    "@xmath27 , we make use of the following relation : @xmath28 where the amplitude @xmath29 is computed by the su(6 ) quark model  @xcite . for simplicity , we consider only the low - lying resonance states , since we are interested in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "the magnetic transition strengths for the resonances , @xmath30 , are estimated from the experimental and theoretical values for the helicity amplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude can be written with the phenomenological form factors that satisfy the ward - takahashi identity as follows : @xmath33f_c^2   + \\mathcal{m}_{t(k)}f_k^2 + \\mathcal{m}_{t(\\kappa ) } f_\\kappa^2   + \\mathcal{m}_{s(\\delta ) } f_\\delta^2 + \\mathcal{m}_{u(\\sigma^ * ) } f_{\\sigma^*}^2 + \\mathcal{m}_{s(n^*)}f_{n^*}^2 + \\mathcal{m}_{s(\\delta^*)}f_{\\delta^*}^2    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the form factors are defined generically as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 stand for the momentum transfer , the cutoff masses for the meson - exchange and baryon - pole diagrams , respectively . for the details of the theoretical framework , readers can refer to  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the numerical results . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show them for the differential cross section as functions of @xmath38 for different photon energies @xmath39 gev .",
    "the solid and dotted curves indicate the cases with and without the resonance contributions , respectively .",
    "the experimental data are taken from the clas  @xcite and taps  @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the two experimental data are qualitatively well reproduced and the resonance contributions are almost negligible .",
    "we verify that the @xmath4 and @xmath3 exchanges provide strong contribution in the forward scattering region , whereas the backward scattering regions are dominated by the @xmath23 exchange in the @xmath40 channel .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0 photoproduction using the effective lagrangian method at the tree - level born approximation .",
    "in addition to the born terms , we also took into account the resonance contributions in the @xmath7 and @xmath40 channels .",
    "the experimental data were reproduced qualitatively well .",
    "it also turns out that the resonance contributions are almost negligible in the energy and angular dependences of the cross sections , being different from the @xmath41 and @xmath42 photoproductions .",
    "the strange meson ( @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) exchanges in the @xmath5 channel and the @xmath6 contribution in the @xmath7 channel are the most dominant in describing the @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "more detailed works are under progress and appear elsewhere .",
    "this talk was presented at the 20th international iupap conference on few - body problems in physics , @xmath43 august 2012 , fukuoka , japan .",
