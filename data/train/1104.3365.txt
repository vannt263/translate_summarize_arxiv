    "<S> @xcite , the tensor form factors of the pion were calculated and the probability density of the polarized quarks inside the pion was derived by combining the tensor form factors with the electromagnetic ( em ) ones , based on the nonlocal chiral quark model ( n@xmath1qm ) from the instanton vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the results were in good agreement with the lattice data  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also of great interest to study the spin structure of the kaon , since it sheds light on the effects of flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking on behavior of the strange quark . </S>",

    "<S> the model provides a suitable framework to study properties of the kaon , since the instanton vacuum explains the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath1sb ) naturally via quark zero modes and the explicit breaking of flavor su(3 ) symmetry can be treated consistently . </S>",

    "<S> it is essential to know quantitatively the em form factor of the kaon . </S>",

    "<S> note that the results of model i are the same as those given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as they should be . </S>",
    "<S> as for the pion , the results from the two models almost coincide with each other because of the small masses of the light quarks in comparison to the renormalization point @xmath105 mev , and turn out to be in good agreement with the experimental data taken from refs .  </S>",

    "<S> this renormalization - point value is proportional to the inverse of the average ( anti)instanton size , i.e. @xmath106  @xcite , indicating the scale of the quark-(anti)instanton interaction strength . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , the kaon em form factors depend on which model we are using . </S>",
    "<S> the results of model i are underestimated , being compared with the experimental data  @xcite : for example , the kaon charge radius turns out to be @xmath111 , which is about @xmath112 larger than the experimental one @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have the smaller value of the kaon decay constant @xmath114 mev in comparison to the corresponding empirical value @xmath115 mev . </S>",
    "<S> these sizable deviations from the data have been already observed in our previous work  @xcite , and can be understood by the absence of the meson - loop corrections ( mlc ) which is essential for the cases with the explicit flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , to remedy this problem for the kaon case , one may consider the mlc coming from the mesonic fluctuations around the saddle point . </S>",

    "<S> both the results for the pion and kaon were in good agreement with the data .    </S>",
    "<S> having evaluated the generalized vector and tensor form factors of the kaon , we proceeded to compute the probability densities of the polarized quark inside the kaon . in doing so , we parametrized the form factors , employing the simple monopole and @xmath123-pole type parameterizations for the vector and tensor ones . </S>",
    "<S> using the parametrized results , we computed the probability densities of the unpolarized and polarized quarks inside the kaon as functions of the impact parameters , which reveal the spin structures of the kaon . anticipating the data from the lattice simulation in near future </S>",

    "<S> we summarize the important observations in the present work :    * the electromagnetic form factor of the pion is reproduced quantitatively well for both models , whereas that of the kaon is well described within model ii , i.e. the phenomenological one , compared to the original model ( model i ) in which there is no free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be understood by the absence of the @xmath126 meson - loop corrections in the present work , which will improve the results of the original model . * due to the explicit flavor su(3 ) symmetry breaking , the up and strange form factors turn out to be asymmetric with respect to the interchange of up and strange quarks , i.e. @xmath52-spin transformation , being different from the pion case . in general </S>",
    "<S> we find that the strange form factors are relatively flat in comparison to the up form factors . * in parametrizing the form factors , we find that model ii provides larger pole masses @xmath127 gev than those from model i @xmath128 gev . </S>",
    "<S> note that the results of model i are closer to those of the pion . * </S>",
    "<S> considering the tensor form factors , we find that the probability density for the polarized quarks get distorted . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of this distortion can be measured by the deviation of the average value of @xmath129 from zero . in model ii </S>",
    "<S> , the deviation depending on quark species is seen more obviously , i.e. @xmath130 fm , while almost no difference is observed for model i. * the rg evolution of the the present results brings about the tensor charges as follows : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 at the renormalization scale @xmath125 gev , theoretical uncertainties of the present model being taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown in the present work , the generalized form factors play a role of revealing the internal spin structures of mesons . while it is very difficult to get access directly to the spin structures of mesons </S>",
    "<S> , the lattice data will shed light on understanding them . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the generalized form factors with different operators and with higher moments will further show us how the quarks inside the kaon behave more in detail . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it will be of great interest to investigate them in the future . </S>"
