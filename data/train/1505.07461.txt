    "as one of the brightest binary stars in the sky , capella ( @xmath15aurigae , hd34029 , hr1708 , hip24608 , + , @xmath16 days , @xmath17 ) has been studied for more than a century with a wide range of techniques and at all observable wavelengths .",
    "a persistent source of frustration for several decades has been the difficulty in determining accurate absolute masses for the components , despite the wealth of astrometric and spectroscopic measurements available .",
    "the history of this problem has been related by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and most recently in our earlier paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t09 ) .",
    "the challenge associated with the masses has hindered efforts to pin down the precise evolutionary state of the more massive primary star , which has widely been considered to be a core helium - burning object , based mostly on timescale arguments .",
    "disappointingly , current stellar evolution models have so far largely failed to confirm that notion , as it has not been possible to achieve a satisfactory fit to the global properties of both stars simultaneously at a single age when assuming the bulk chemical composition the system is believed to have .",
    "the secondary , on the other hand , is clearly on its way across the hertzprung gap .",
    "the uncertainty in the masses was thought to have been solved in the t09 analysis , which improved the formal precision by about a factor of three compared to previous estimates , and documented efforts to control systematic errors in the radial velocities that have likely plagued the determination of the velocity amplitude of the rapidly - rotating secondary star for decades , as described there . despite this , it was still not possible to establish the state of the primary component unambiguously when enforcing a single age .    in the interim , @xcite have presented a new spectroscopic study of capella based on much higher - quality observational material that leads to significantly larger masses for both stars than in our 2009 study , by several times the stated uncertainties . in particular , the spread in mass between the stars increased from 1% to about 3.5% , which is an enormous difference for a pair of giants , and could drastically change the assessment of their relative state of evolution .",
    "in addition , we have now made a new determination of the chemical composition of capella that is appreciably different from the abundance assumed in the earlier paper , and is a key ingredient for the comparison with stellar evolution models .",
    "these two developments motivate us to take a fresh look at the system in order to investigate the impact of the new measurements .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have presented evidence that the orbit of capella may be very slightly eccentric , unexpectedly , whereas all previous studies including our own assumed it is circular .",
    "it is of interest , therefore , to revisit our 2009 study of tidal evolution in the system ( orbit circularization and rotational synchronization ) with more sophisticated models than used there , especially in light of the new masses .    we have organized the paper as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : rvs ] we describe the new spectroscopic observations of @xcite and comment on the issue of systematics in the radial velocities , in comparison with our previous results from 2009 .",
    "a revised orbital fit for capella is the presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : orbit ] , using also astrometric and other measurements from t09 .",
    "[ sec : chemical ] reports a new detailed chemical analysis of both stars from disentangled spectra , along with a determination of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "the revised physical properties of the stars are collected in sect .",
    "[ sec : properties ] , and are compared against three different sets of stellar evolution models in sect .",
    "[ sec : stellarevolution ] .",
    "key chemical diagnostics available for capella are also compared with model predictions in this section . then in sect .",
    "[ sec : tidalevolution ] we examine the evolution of orbital and stellar properties subjected to the influence of tidal mechanisms , as a test of that theory . sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] presents a discussion of the results and concluding remarks .",
    "finally , the appendix provides an update on the orbital properties of the wide common proper motion companion of capella .",
    "the numerous historical radial - velocity ( rv ) measurements of capella have been discussed at length in our t09 study , which highlighted how challenging it has been to determine accurate values for the rapidly rotating secondary star ( @xmath18  kms@xmath19 ) , whereas those of the sharp - lined primary ( @xmath20  kms@xmath19 ) have been quite consistent over the last century .",
    "t09 presented 162 new rv determinations for both components based on spectra obtained at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) covering only a very narrow wavelength range ( 45 ) .",
    "the rvs were measured using the two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm todcor @xcite , with synthetic templates appropriate for each star .",
    "because of the limited wavelength coverage , those measurements are susceptible to systematic errors resulting mostly from lines shifting in and out of the spectral window as a function of orbital phase .",
    "therefore , an effort was made to control those biases by performing numerical simulations to determine corrections to the velocities , which were at the level of the final uncertainties in the individual measurements for the secondary , and slightly larger for the primary .",
    "final errors in the rvs as measured from the scatter in the orbital fit were about 0.44  kms@xmath19  for the primary and 0.89  kms@xmath19  for the secondary . a sign that systematic errors remained at some level in the cfa velocities was evident in the residuals of the secondary star shown in figure  2 of t09 , in which a pattern can be seen as a function of orbital phase , with a peak semi - amplitude of about twice the typical error .",
    "possible explanations for this , as discussed by t09 , include the presence of spots on the active secondary star , or template mismatch .",
    "kms@xmath19 ) was not quite as large as appropriate for giant stars .",
    "this also resulted in an overestimation of the rotational velocities of the components , as discussed by t09 .",
    "] an additional indication of possible biases was the fact that a small offset ( @xmath21  kms@xmath19 ) was found between the primary and secondary velocities in the global orbital fit of t09 that could not be accounted for by differences in the gravitational redshift between the stars , and was ascribed to similar reasons as the secondary residual pattern .",
    "more recently @xcite have reported new rv measurements for capella based on a very large set of more than 400 spectra obtained with the stella chelle spectrograph @xcite on a 1.2 m robotic telescope in tenerife , spain .",
    "these spectra are of far superior quality than those of t09 , both in terms of wavelength coverage ( two orders of magnitude larger ) and signal - to - noise ratios . @xcite",
    "derived velocities using a similar two - dimensional cross - correlation approach as t09 , and also performed numerical simulations to assess and correct for systematic errors caused by the measuring technique .",
    "the velocity scatter from their orbital fit is 0.064  kms@xmath19  for the primary and 0.297  kms@xmath19  for the secondary , seven and three times smaller than in t09 , respectively .",
    "the key difference in this data set compared to t09 is in the resulting velocity semi - amplitude of the secondary star ( @xmath22  kms@xmath19 ) , which is more than 6@xmath23 larger than reported by t09 ( @xmath24  kms@xmath19 ) .",
    "this difference alone leads to absolute masses for capella that are 4% larger than in t09 for the primary , and 2% for the secondary , a very significant change that exceeds the formal mass errors by a factor of many .",
    "the semi - amplitudes @xmath25 of the primary star , on the other hand , are in virtually perfect agreement ( see below ) .    despite the much improved random errors of @xcite , the residuals of the secondary velocities from their spectroscopic orbital model",
    "( see their figure  2 ) still display a phase - dependent pattern reminiscent of the one in t09 , also with a semi - amplitude of roughly twice the errors , but at a much lower level in absolute terms .",
    "moreover , they note that a small offset is seen again between the primary and secondary velocities ( 0.059  kms@xmath19 ) that can not be explained by the gravitational redshift effect .",
    "this suggests that systematic errors may still be lurking in these new measurements , for possibly some of the same reasons as before . nevertheless , any remaining systematics are likely to be significantly less important than in t09 , as expected not only from the much higher quality of the spectroscopic material , but suggested also by the significantly smaller magnitudes of _ i _ ) the corrections for systematics applied by @xcite , _ ii _ ) the formal uncertainties in the individual rvs , or equivalently , the scatter from the spectroscopic orbital solution , _ iii _ ) the amplitude of the residual pattern for the secondary , and _ iv _ ) the unexplained residual primary / secondary offset . in the next section",
    "we therefore incorporate these measurements in a new orbital analysis of capella .    of the 438 rv measurements reported in table  1 of @xcite ,",
    "their final solution excluded 14 for the primary and 7 for the secondary .",
    "we have done the same here as we found them to give unusually large residuals , and we adopted also the measurement uncertainties as published .",
    "the global orbital solution in our t09 study of capella combined all usable astrometric observations in the literature with the cfa rvs for both stars , as well as radial velocities for the primary star from many of the historical data sets .",
    "the latter were carefully examined to ensure that they imply @xmath25 values consistent with those from the cfa rvs in separate spectroscopic solutions using the same fixed orbital period ( see t09 , table  2 ) .",
    "a similar solution of the @xcite velocities shows that the primary semi - amplitude , @xmath26  kms@xmath19 , is essentially the same as that from the cfa rvs , @xmath27  kms@xmath19 .",
    "therefore , for our revised global solution below we have incorporated the @xcite measurements for both stars , the cfa velocities for the primary ( but not the secondary ) , and the primary velocities from the same historical data sets as used in t09 .",
    "although the @xcite observations certainly dominate by weight , the older measurements are still useful because they extend the baseline more than a century , improving the orbital period .",
    "the extensive astrometry available for capella includes measurements made by many authors with the technique of long - baseline interferometry , beginning with the work of @xcite , as well as speckle interferometry , direct imaging , and the intermediate astrometric measurements from _",
    "have all been described and tabulated in our earlier study , and we refer the reader to that work for details .",
    "so far as we are aware , no further astrometric observations have been published for capella except for those of @xcite , which we do not use here , however , because of concerns expressed by these authors about possible systematic errors affecting their measurements .",
    "our global orbital fit follows closely that described by t09 , and includes the following parameters : orbital period ( @xmath28 ) , relative angular semi - major axis ( @xmath29 ) , inclination angle ( @xmath30 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath31 ) , longitude of periastron of the more massive and cooler star ( @xmath32 ) , position angle of the ascending node for the equinox j2000.0 ( @xmath33 ) , time of periastron passage ( @xmath34 ) , center - of - mass velocity ( @xmath35 ) , the velocity semi - amplitudes for each star ( @xmath25 and @xmath36 ) , the angular semimajor axis of the photocenter ( @xmath37 ) , corrections to the _ hipparcos _  catalog values of the sky position of the barycenter ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) at the mean catalog reference epoch of 1991.25 , and corrections to the proper motion components ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) . to account for differences in the zero points of the various rv data",
    "sets relative to the primary star measurements of @xcite , we have also solved for 10 velocity offsets , one for each set .",
    "an additional parameter , @xmath42 , was included to correct the scale of the angular separation measurements from two of the astrometric data sets ( see t09 for details ) .",
    "@xcite discussed several adjustments made to their secondary velocities to place them on the same system as their primary velocities of capella .",
    "these adjustments were intended to correct for differences in the gravitational redshift of the two components , and other shifts of unknown origin ( see above ) . from their discussion",
    "it is not entirely clear to us whether these constant shifts have been applied to the velocities they reported , so our global solution includes one additional offset , @xmath43 , to account for possible residual effects . with this",
    ", the total number of adjustable parameters in our fit is 27 .",
    "the solution in our t09 study assumed a circular orbit for capella , as have all previous analyses of the binary .",
    "we noted , however , that there were hints of a non - zero eccentricity in the interferometric measurements of @xcite , though not in the cfa rvs or in any of the other data sets .",
    "we ascribed this to the transformation that @xcite made between their original interferometric visibilities ( @xmath44 ) and the nightly relative positions in polar coordinates that they published , given that their own solution using the original visibilities indicated a circular orbit .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , however , a spectroscopic fit using their rvs also indicates a statistically significant non - zero eccentricity , of very nearly the same magnitude as we had seen , and even with a consistent longitude of periastron .",
    "this suggests we may have been too quick to dismiss the possibility of a non - circular orbit in t09 , as unexpected as this may be for a pair of giants ( one being a clump star ) in a period of 104 days ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss this further in sect .",
    "[ sec : tidalevolution ] . for our new global solution",
    "we have chosen to allow the orbit to be eccentric , on the assumption that the effect is real .",

    "figures  [ fig : claret1 ] and [ fig : claret2 ] show , for example , that between the ages of 648 and 649 myr the temperature of the secondary decreases by 1130k , cooling by a further 660k over the next million years .",

    "a test with granada models that include rotation for both components gave a very similar fit , with an age of 655 myr that is only marginally older than before .",
    "the evolution of the surface chemistry in giants is the result of mixing and is directly related to the depth of the convection zone , which changes drastically as the stars approach the so - called first dredge - up , during their initial ascent of the giant branch .",

    "in particular , the equations are linearized around the equilibrium state , and are strictly valid only for relatively small eccentricities and near - synchronous rotation , as well as relatively small obliquities .    in this work",
    "we have chosen to use the more general equations of tidal evolution by @xcite , which are valid for arbitrary eccentricities and rotation rates , although they are still restricted to relatively low mutual inclination angles @xmath266 .",
    "we used a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm to integrate the six coupled differential equations describing the time - dependent changes in the orbital semimajor axis ( @xmath267 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath268 ) , angular rotational velocities of both stars ( @xmath269 , @xmath270 ) , and their spin - orbit angles ( @xmath271 , @xmath272 ) . in what follows we",

    "qualitatively the largest difference is perhaps in the orbital eccentricity , which theory predicts should strictly have fallen to zero some 35 myr ago , driven almost exclusively by the evolution of the primary star .",
    "quantitatively , however , the difference in @xmath31 between theory and observation is small , as the measured value ( if real ) is only @xmath279 .",
    "while the agreement reached in these four observed properties is not entirely unexpected because we have allowed for four free parameters ( the initial values ) , we note that the good fit was only possible by increasing the nominal efficiency of the tidal dissipation by more than an order of magnitude . without this increase ,",

    "we had to increase the efficiency of the tidal mechanisms by a factor of @xmath040 .",

    "tests with other ( non - zero ) values show that the behavior is qualitatively always the same : the primary s spin axis aligns itself with the orbital axis ( i.e. , @xmath266 reaches zero ) well before the current age , whereas the secondary remains formally misaligned .",
    "the alignment of the primary happens at very nearly the same time that its rotation becomes synchronous and that the orbit circularizes .",
    "the spin - orbit angle of the secondary quickly shrinks to zero shortly after the present age ( 45 myr later ) , at which time it also synchronizes its rotation with the mean orbital motion . in both cases",
    "the changes are the result of significant structural adjustments in the stars , such as a sharp increase in the radius of gyration , @xmath282 , related to the moment of inertia through @xmath283 ( see figure  [ fig : tidal]e ) .",
    "while we can not measure the present - day values of @xmath266 , it is possible to gain indirect knowledge about these angles using our spectroscopic estimates of @xmath208 along with the measurements of @xmath209 and the radii of both stars .",
    "these quantities are trivially related by @xmath284 where the inclination angle on the left - hand side ( inaccessible to direct observation ) is strictly that of the stellar spin axis relative to the line of sight ( @xmath285 ) , and also appears on the right .",

    "this indirect empirical evidence that the obliquity may currently be zero for both stars ( which would hardly happen by chance ) appears to point to a discrepancy with the prediction from tidal theory for the secondary component ( figure  [ fig : tidal]f ) , whereas for the primary there is good agreement .",
    "it is possible that part of the reason for this difference lies in the small - angle approximation implicit in the tidal differential equations of @xcite for the angle @xmath266 .",
    "however , we note also that the secondary of capella happens to be in such a rapid state of evolution that theoretical predictions for the spin - orbit angle are extremely sensitive to other details , including those related to structural changes in the stars happening at this stage",
    ". those changes may actually have a larger impact than the dissipation processes themselves ( though the latter must also matter ) .",
    "in particular , changes in both the spin rate and the spin - orbit angle are strongly driven in part by the sudden change in the moment of inertia ( or equivalently , the gyration radius ) illustrated in figure  [ fig : tidal]e .",
    "an additional complication is the large ad - hoc increase in the efficiency of the tidal mechanism that was required to match other observations , as mentioned earlier .",
    "thus , a definitive assessment of the accuracy of tidal theory related to its other approximations is difficult in this case .",
    "an alternate way of comparing observations with the predictions from tidal and evolution models combined is by examining the evolution of @xmath208 , which is a spectroscopically measured quantity .",
    "it is a function of the stellar radius , the spin rate , and the inclination angle of the rotation axis to the line of sight , @xmath285 ( eq.[[eq : vsini ] ] ) .",
    "the latter angle is not directly predicted by theory , but is related to other angles by @xmath295 in which the obliquity @xmath266 can be predicted , @xmath30 is known , and @xmath90 is the angle between the sky projections of the spin axis and the orbital axis ( ` projected obliquity ' ) .",
    "the angle @xmath90 changes with time and is directly measurable in eclipsing systems by observing the rossiter - mclaughlin effect . as capella",
    "does not eclipse we have no knowledge of this angle in this case , except for the weak condition that it represents a lower limit to the three - dimensional angle @xmath266 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "eq.[[eq : lambda ] ] may be solved for the quantity @xmath286 that we need in order to compute @xmath208 with eq.[[eq : vsini ] ] , resulting in the quadratic equation @xmath296 where @xmath297 for the primary star the prediction that @xmath290 near the current epoch means that @xmath90 is also zero . using this value in the equations above to compute the expected evolution of the projected rotational velocity leads to the trend shown in figure  [ fig : tidal]g , where we refer to @xmath208 more properly as @xmath298 .",
    "values at times when @xmath299 will be somewhat less accurate because the projected obliquity @xmath90 may also be different from zero .",
    "the predicted value of 4.0  kms@xmath19  at the current age is in excellent agreement with the measurement ( @xmath300  kms@xmath19 ) .",
    "the corresponding evolution of @xmath301 is seen in figure  [ fig : tidal]h . in this case the predicted value at the current age does not match the measurement , and the discrepancy is in part a reflection of the evolution of @xmath266 that was discussed above , but also has to do with the very rapid changes in the structure of the star ( @xmath224 , @xmath302 ) at the present time .",
    "tests in which we changed @xmath90 within reason yielded very similar results , and can not explain the difference .    finally , it is of interest to verify that the components of capella have always been detached , as any significant mass transfer earlier in their lives ( e.g. , through roche lobe overflow in the primary ) would invalidate our comparison with stellar evolution models , which are designed for normal ( unperturbed ) stars .",
    "the fraction of its roche lobe filled by the primary component depends on its size and also on the size of the orbit , which changes due to tidal forces ( figure  [ fig : tidal]b ) . the same granada evolutionary track used above indicates the star attained a maximum radius at the tip of the giant branch of about 38@xmath5 at an age of 617  myr ( mesa models predict a similar maximum size of 36@xmath5 ) , and the filling factor ( @xmath303 ) at the time was approximately 0.63 .",
    "this indicates that mass transfer through roche - lobe overflow has not taken place in capella .",
    "for the first time current stellar evolution models are shown here to provide a satisfactory fit to the observed global properties of both components of capella at a single age , for a chemical composition equal to that measured .",
    "the comparison confirms the long - held but largely unsubstantiated belief that the primary is a clump star , and more precisely , it suggests capella  a is near the end of its core he - burning phase , as indicated consistently by three different sets of models .",
    "the principal factors that have allowed the better match are an improvement in the accuracy of the absolute masses , made possible by the high - quality radial - velocity measurements of @xcite , and the first robust determination of the metallicity of capella derived here .",
    "our detailed chemical analysis of the disentangled spectra of the components yields essentially the same near - solar composition for the two stars , which is rather different from the sub - solar abundance the binary was previously assumed to have in our earlier t09 study .",
    "all measured properties ( masses , radii , temperatures , and independently derived luminosities ) are now simultaneously in agreement with the models to within 0.41.4@xmath23 , depending on the model .",
    "this result strengthens our confidence in evolutionary calculations for evolved stars .",
    "chemical indicators of evolution that differ greatly between the components , such as the @xmath13c/@xmath14c ratio , the lithium abundance , and the c / n ratio , are also broadly in agreement with theoretical predictions , though with somewhat larger differences that may be due to either shortcomings in the mixing prescriptions in the models , or observational errors in these delicate measurements .",
    "rarely has it been possible to perform this type of test involving key chemical diagnostics for a binary with two evolved components having well - determined absolute dimensions ( @xmath304 , @xmath224 , etc . ) , such as capella .",
    "on the other hand , the performance of tidal theory as described by the tidal evolution equations of @xcite is not as good .",
    "as was noticed previously by @xcite , we again find that the efficiency of the tidal mechanisms involved seems to be too low by a factor of @xmath040 , if predictions are to be consistent with the large rotational velocities capella a and b presumably had earlier in their lives as a - type stars ( @xmath305kms@xmath19 ) , and at the same time the much lower velocities they now have as evolved stars .",
    "application of an ad - hoc adjustment of this magnitude brings agreement , although theory still forecasts a significant misalignment between the spin axis of the secondary and the orbital axis at the present age , whereas empirical evidence based on the direct measurement of the star s radius , rotation period , and @xmath208 seems to favor an obliquity consistent with zero .",
    "model predictions about the synchronous rotation of the primary and its spin - orbit alignment do agree with observational clues , as does the supersynchronous rotation of the secondary .",
    "a small additional disagreement in that the orbit seems to be very slightly eccentric even though it is expected to be perfectly circular may or may not be significant , as the difference is small .    finally , another important consequence of our revised chemical composition for capella concerns the relationship with the coronal abundances , which have been measured by many authors as summarized by t09 .",
    "coronal abundances in the sun are known to depend on the first ionization potential ( fip ) , in such a way that low - fip elements ( less than 10 ev ) are overabundant compared to those with higher fip ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "t09 showed this to be the case for capella as well .",
    "other stars display the opposite effect ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what is less clear from evidence in other stars is whether the low - fip elements are enhanced relative to the photospheric abundance , or whether it is the high - fip elements that are depleted compared to the photosphere .",
    "t09 adopted a sub - solar photospheric composition for capella of @xmath214 } = -0.34 \\pm 0.07 $ ] , based on the work of @xcite , and since this agreed with the measured coronal abundances of the high - fip elements ( see their figure  18 ) , they concluded it was the low - fip elements that were enhanced .",
    "interestingly , our revised photospheric abundance of @xmath306 } = -0.04 \\pm 0.06 $ ] leads to precisely the opposite conclusion : now it is the low - fip elements that agree with the photosphere , and therefore the high - fip elements are depleted .",
    "a recent study by @xcite of the coronae of stars with super - solar photospheric abundances found the same effect shown by capella in @xmath15  cen a and b , which have somewhat similar temperatures , although these are dwarfs so it is unclear how significant this may be . in any case , capella now represents a robust point of reference for such studies in evolved and active stars .",
