    "the deepest image of the universe acquired with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , the udf @xcite , provides a new opportunity to study the structure of the galactic disk and the halo to its limits .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite used the hubble deep field north @xcite and south @xcite data to constrain the stellar content of the galaxy .",
    "they proposed that the faint blue objects observed in these fields are old halo white dwarfs that would be consistent with the observed microlensing events toward the large magellanic cloud @xcite and would explain part of the dark matter in the solar neighborhood .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that some of these faint blue objects are confused with quasars and an extensive study including proper motion measurements and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting is required to identify stars in deep _",
    "hst _ images .",
    "the udf is the only deep field that is studied spectroscopically by the pioneering work of @xcite . using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) observations of the udf and the low resolution spectroscopy from the grism acs program for extragalactic science survey ( grapes , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite identified 26 stars and 2 quasars brighter than @xmath0 mag and additional 18 unresolved sources with @xmath5 mag .",
    "they defined a stellarity index ( @xmath6 ) using the curve of growth analysis of the light distribution of each object , and identified all objects with @xmath7 as unresolved sources .",
    "more importantly , the grapes spectra enabled @xcite to differentiate blue extra - galactic objects , i.e. quasars , from stars down to fainter magnitudes .",
    "they spectroscopically confirmed two of the 18 faint unresolved sources as quasars , and classified the remaining 16 sources as stars . assuming that these objects are main - sequence stars",
    ", they would have to be at distances larger than 300 kpc .",
    "therefore , the only viable explanation for these objects would be faint white dwarfs in the thick disk or halo of the galaxy .",
    "if these are high - velocity white dwarfs , they could contribute @xmath8% to the total dark matter halo mass .",
    "on the other hand , not all of these sources are expected to be stars and some contamination from blue extra - galactic sources is likely .",
    "@xcite split the udf data set into two halves with a baseline of 73 days , and demonstrated that there are no sources with proper motion @xmath9 mas yr@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite used shallower data from two additional epochs with a 3 yr baseline to identify proper motion objects , finding 7 objects with significant proper motions .    here",
    "we take advantage of the wide field camera 3 infrared data from the udf12 campaign , a 128-orbit large _ hst _ program @xcite , to measure proper motions for the point sources identified by @xcite , including sources fainter than @xmath0 mag .",
    "these data were obtained in 2012 august - september , and provide an @xmath118.7 yr baseline for astrometry .",
    "@xcite describe data reduction and calibration procedures for these observations .",
    "the udf12 observations in four near - infrared filters , f105w , f125w , f140w , and f160w , also greatly extend our ability to constrain the spectral type for each object .",
    "the deepest images are in the f105w ( 100 orbits ) and f160w ( 84 orbits ) bands , which correspond roughly to j and h filters , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 limiting sensitivity of the f105w image reaches an ab magnitude of 30 .",
    "hence , these data provide the best opportunity yet to measure proper motions and to model the seds of the stars in the udf .",
    "section 2 describes the identification of point sources , while  3 presents our proper motion measurements .",
    " 4 describes our sed fitting procedures and classifications for the faint sources in the udf .",
    "we discuss various implications of these results in  5 .",
    "to identify unresolved sources , @xcite used the iraf task radprof and performed aperture photometry using increasing aperture sizes .",
    "they fit a cubic spline to these measurements to create a point spread function ( psf ) for each object .",
    "they compared each psf with the empirical combined - psf from bright unresolved objects , and classified objects with psf distributions similar to this empirical psf as unresolved sources .",
    "this approach works well for bright targets , but it is likely to fail for nearly unresolved faint objects .",
    "the discovery of 16 unresolved sources with @xmath13 mag in the udf is potentially important , but clearly unexpected .    to verify the classification of point sources and to derive precise centroids for each target , we use the iraf daophot package to create a psf template using bright , unsaturated , isolated targets in the i - band ( deepest ) image and use this template to fit each object .",
    "figure 1 shows the sharpness parameter ( @xmath14 ) derived from daophot as a function of magnitude .",
    "stars have @xmath15 , whereas resolved objects have increasingly larger @xmath14 based on their morphology .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the point sources can be identified reliably down to about @xmath0 mag .",
    "@xcite identified 28 point sources , including two spectroscopically confirmed quasars , brighter than @xmath0 mag .",
    "all but one of these sources , udf 4322 , have @xmath14 indicative of stars .",
    "figure 2 presents the psf distributions for 23 of these 28 sources that are not saturated in the i - band image .",
    "@xmath14 for each source is also given in each panel .",
    "we use the iraf task pradprof to plot the radial profile of each object .",
    "we also plot the i - band psf template in each panel for a direct comparison .",
    "a comparison of the psf for each object with our template psf shows that all but one of these sources have psf distributions consistent with being unresolved .",
    "the psf distribution for udf 4322 is slightly shallower than the other point sources , and udf 4322 is likely a resolved object .",
    "all of the unresolved objects in the udf , except saturated sources , have @xmath160.12 , while udf 4322 has @xmath17 .",
    "we note that udf 4322 also has an sed significantly different from the stellar objects ( see  4 ) .",
    "figure 3 presents the contour maps of the flux distribution around udf 4322 and an unresolved source with a similar brightness .",
    "a comparison of the contour maps for udf 4322 ( @xmath18 mag ) with udf 443 ( @xmath19 mag ) shows that unresolved sources have circular contour maps , whereas udf 4322 is elongated , and slightly resolved in the @xmath20 band image .",
    "excluding udf 4322 from the list of unresolved objects and the two spectroscopically confirmed quasars ( udf 6732 and 9397 ) , there are 25 sources brighter than @xmath0 mag that are clearly stellar .",
    "the morphological classification of point sources is more problematic for fainter magnitudes .",
    "@xcite classify 18 objects with @xmath13 mag as point sources , including two quasars ( udf 4120 and 8157 ) .",
    "figure 4 presents the psf distributions of these 18 sources compared to the i - band psf template derived from brighter stellar sources .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the majority of these fainter sources are likely resolved objects .",
    "only two of these sources , udf 7113 and 8081 , have radial profiles consistent with unresolved objects and @xmath15 .",
    "the radial profiles for the remaining 16 targets are too shallow to be stellar .",
    "proper motion measurements are the best way to identify stars in deep _ hst _ images , and to distinguish between unresolved quasars and stellar objects .",
    "they are also crucial for constraining the kinematic properties of each object , and assigning membership in the galactic disk or halo .",
    "to identify high proper motion objects in the udf , we used the deepest images from the udf 2004 and udf12 datasets ; i(f775w)- , j(f105w)- , and h(f160w)-band images . @xcite",
    "provided source catalogs for the first epoch data using the source extractor package @xcite , which is designed to work best for resolved objects .",
    "we used the daophot package to create a psf template for each filter and used this template to precisely constrain the centroids for each object in each epoch .",
    "we identified @xmath21200 compact objects ( isolated , low residuals , and not fuzzy ) that can be used as reference objects to define an absolute reference frame .",
    "these sources have half light radii r50 @xmath22 4 pixels , ellipticity @xmath22 0.5 , full width at half maximum @xmath22 8 pixels , and stellarity index ( as defined by source extractor ) larger than 0.7 . we visually inspected all of these sources in different filters to avoid any mismatches .",
    "we used the iraf routine geomap to fit a quadratic polynomial to map the distortions and deleted deviant points using a @xmath23 rejection algorithm .",
    "rejection of very deviant points is required because the reference objects are compact galaxies and centroiding errors are larger for galaxies .",
    "after mapping the distortions with the geomap package , we transformed the object coordinates to the second epoch positions with the geoxytran routine . using the reference objects",
    ", we confirm the pixel size difference between the optical and infrared images ( 30 mas versus 60 mas pixel@xmath10 ) and that their orientations are aligned to better than 0.002@xmath24 .",
    "figure 5 presents the differences in position between the udf04 i - band and the udf12 f105w images for 200 compact objects that form our reference frame .",
    "red circles mark objects brigher than @xmath0 mag .",
    "the majority of these compact sources do not show any positional differences over the 8.7 yr baseline .",
    "however , there are seven objects brighter than @xmath0 mag that show significant motion .",
    "these sources are labeled in the figure and they are clearly stars .",
    "we check these results using our second deepest image in the udf12 dataset , the f160w image .",
    "the dotted lines mark the location of each source in the f160w image .",
    "since the f160w image mostly consists of the data from the udf09 program , the baseline between the i and f160w images are shorter .",
    "the observed locations of the seven moving objects in the f160w image are consistent with the f105w image positions , providing further evidence that these seven relatively bright objects are clearly moving .",
    "there are several fainter objects with @xmath25 mag that show significant motion in the f105w image .",
    "however , none of these objects show the same motion in the f160w image , indicating that they are likely resolved galaxies .",
    "color - dependent morphological differences in these galaxies may cause our psf - fitting algorithm to find slightly different centroids for these faint sources , and explain the differences in positions measured from the i - band , f105w , and f160w images .",
    "hence , we do not find any moving objects fainter than @xmath0 mag .",
    "the main source of error in our proper motion measurements is the positions of the reference compact objects ( galaxies ) .",
    "the residuals in the coordinate transformations are 0.3 pixels ( 9 mas ) in each coordinate . given the 8.7 year baseline between the udf04 and udf12 programs , this corresponds to 1.04 mas yr@xmath10errors in each coordinate , or 1.47 mas yr@xmath10  total proper motion errors for each source .",
    "tables 1 and 2 present the proper motions for 46 unresolved source candidates identified by @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared images from the wide field camera 3 cover an area smaller than the optical data .",
    "hence , some of these sources are not in the udf12 dataset .",
    "on the other hand , a few of the brighter sources have proper motion measurements from an earlier epoch @xcite .",
    "we include these measurements in table 1 to have a nearly complete list of proper motions for each source . in total , there are 12 sources with ( @xmath1 ) significant proper motions .",
    "figure 6 compares proper motion measurements for 11 objects that are common between our study and that of @xcite .",
    "the latter study is limited to @xmath26 mag objects due to shallower data .",
    "our measurements agree with the @xcite results within @xmath27 errors .",
    "this gives us confidence that our proper motion measurements are reliable .",
    "@xcite determined the spectral types of the unresolved objects in the udf by fitting stellar templates to the low resolution grism spectroscopy from the grapes survey .",
    "the spectroscopic data quality degrades with increasing magnitude and the background subtraction becomes the limiting factor for the objects fainter than @xmath0 mag .",
    "the seds for the majority of the unresolved sources are best - fit with late type k - m stars , where infrared data would be extremely useful , but was unavailable for the initial analysis by @xcite and @xcite .    using the f105w , f125w , f140w , and f160w data in the udf12 program , we perform psf - photometry for the unresolved sources detected in these images .",
    "we use an aperture size of @xmath28 and ab magnitude zeropoints of 26.0974 , 26.0449 , 26.2608 , and 25.7551 for the f105w , f125w , f140w , and f160w images , respectively .",
    "in addition , a few of the targets outside the field - of - view of the udf12 observations have infrared photometry available from nicmos observations in the f110w and f160w filters @xcite .",
    "table 3 presents all available optical and infrared photometry for the 46 unresolved source candidates .",
    "we attempt to fit the seds of the udf objects by combining b , v , i , and z photometry from @xcite , our own photometry in the f105w , f125w , f140w , and f160w filters , and the nicmos photometry in the f110w and f160w filters .",
    "we use the iraf task calcphot , which is designed for simulating the hst observations , to simulate the seds for main - sequence stars using @xcite stellar templates for o5 to m6 dwarfs .",
    "we assign spectral types to each object using a @xmath29 minimization technique , where photometry in each band is weighted according to its error .",
    "figure 7 shows the optical and infrared seds and our best - fit templates for the 26 bright ( @xmath26 mag ) unresolved source candidates , excluding the quasars udf 6732 and 9397 .",
    "our classifications for the stars agree reasonably well with the @xcite classifications , but are superior to the previous analysis due to the combination of optical and infrared photometry .",
    "one of these sources , udf 4322 , has an optical sed similar to a7 type stars .",
    "however , its infrared sed shows a flux excess that is similar to the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the udf .",
    "hence , based on its morphology ( fig .",
    "2 and 3 ) and optical and infrared sed , udf 4322 is most likely an extragalactic object .",
    "the seds for the remaining 25 targets fit spectral templates fairly well . we identify 17 m dwarfs , 7 k dwarfs , and one f type star ( udf 9020 ) , which is certainly a white dwarf ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "in addition , udf 4839 has optical photometry that is consistent with a k2 dwarf , but its infrared photometry is significantly fainter than expected for k dwarfs .",
    "this star must be a white dwarf as well .",
    "one of our targets , udf 1147 , is the brightest object in the @xmath30 filter and overly saturated in that image .",
    "its spectrum implies a @xmath31f7 type star , though its @xmath32 photometry is more consistent with a k3 dwarf star .",
    "therefore , we conclude that either its @xmath30 photometry is wrong , or it may have a hotter companion .",
    "unfortunately , the grapes spectrum does not go blue enough to confirm this result , but the blue excess is apparent in its photometry with @xmath33 and @xmath34 mag .",
    "@xcite identified two l dwarf candidates , udf 366 and 443 .",
    "unfortunately , these objects are not in the field of view of the nicmos or wfc3 infrared observations .",
    "the optical seds for these two sources match an m6 spectral template , which is the latest spectral type available in the @xcite library .",
    "follow - up near - infrared observations will be useful to constrain the spectral types for udf 366 and 443 more precisely .",
    "figure 8 shows optical and infrared color - color diagrams for the 46 unresolved source candidates along with the synthetic colors for o5-m6 type stars and cool white dwarfs with pure h and pure he atmospheres @xcite .",
    "these 46 sources follow the stellar sequence in the optical color - color diagrams ( top panel )",
    ". however , the majority of the faint ( @xmath25 mag ) sources and udf 4322 have infrared colors significantly different than stars ( bottom panel ) .",
    "these objects have infrared colors similar to the spectroscopically confirmed quasars udf 6732 and 9397 .",
    "@xcite note that some of these faint sources are hard to distinguish from extragalactic sources without higher signal - to - noise ratio spectra or accurate proper - motion measurements .",
    "contamination from the large number of extra - galactic objects is inevitable at these faint magnitudes .",
    "our proper motion measurements for these sources ( table 2 ) , their radial profiles ( fig . 4 ) , and infrared photometry demonstrate that the majority of the faint unresolved source candidates are extragalactic objects .    among the 18 faint ( @xmath25 mag ) unresolved source candidates ,",
    "none show significant proper motion ( table 2 ) , two are spectroscopically confirmed quasars , and 14 are most likely resolved objects with radial profiles shallower than the template psf ( fig .",
    "4 ) . udf 7113 and 8081 are the only objects with steep radial profiles similar to the unresolved stellar objects brighter than @xmath0 mag .",
    "their sharpness parameters from daophot ( @xmath35 ) are consistent with unresolved sources .",
    "figure 9 shows the optical and infrared seds and best - fit stellar templates for udf 7113 and 8081 .",
    "udf 7113 has colors best - matched by a k7 star , while udf 8081 has colors that are similar to spectroscopically confirmed quasars .",
    "even though the optical portion of udf 8081 s sed is best - matched by an a2 type star , its infrared sed is too red for an a type star or a white dwarf .",
    "hence , udf 8081 is most likely an extragalactic object .",
    "udf 9006 is potentially interesting ; its sharpness parameter of 0.18 and its radial profile is similar to the unresolved sources in the udf .",
    "however , udf 9006 also has an infrared sed that is too red for a blue main - sequence star or a white dwarf .",
    "udf 7113 is the only target fainter than @xmath0 mag that has a radial profile and an optical and infrared sed consistent with stars .",
    "there are 25 stars in the udf down to @xmath0 mag , including 24 k0 or later type stars and 1 f5 type star .",
    "fainter than this limit , udf 7113 ( @xmath36 mag ) is the only source that looks like a star , bringing the total number of stars in the udf to 26 . to estimate photometric distances , we adopt the absolute magnitude ( @xmath37 ) for each spectral type from @xcite , and use it to calculate synthetic absolute magnitudes in the acs f606w filter ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we calculated photometric distances for all of the objects in our sample using the synthetic @xmath38 and the observed @xmath39 magnitudes .",
    "spectral types from our sed fitting procedure , proper motions , absolute magnitudes , distances , and tangential velocities are given in table 1 .",
    "the photometric errors for the udf point sources are relatively small ; the resulting errors in the estimated distances are also very small . however ,",
    "if the assigned spectral types are wrong by 1 index , the absolute magnitudes could be wrong by as much as 1 mag .",
    "the stellar templates we use have approximately solar metallicity .",
    "therefore , the distances to the metal poor halo objects , which will be intrinsically fainter for the same spectral type , are over - estimated by our sed fitting method . to verify the effect of different metallicites , we use synthetic spectra from a phoenix model atmosphere grid @xcite for stars with @xmath40 k , @xmath41= 0 , -2 $ ] , and @xmath42 .",
    "the best fit temperature for the halo metallicity models are on average 300 k cooler ( see the last two columns in table 1 ) .",
    "this difference in temperature implies that the distances and tangential velocities presented in table 1 are likely overestimated for metal - poor stars by a factor of @xmath43 @xcite . despite these potential systematic errors , available kinematic data",
    "is sufficient to identify disk and halo stars and white dwarfs .",
    "the majority of the k0 and later type dwarf stars are consistent with being a late type star in the disk or halo of the galaxy . out of the 25 bright stars , 23 are at distances in the range 1 to 62 kpc .",
    "udf 7113 is consistent with a k7 dwarf at a distance of @xmath31100 kpc and @xmath44 km s@xmath10 .",
    "even though there are several objects with relatively large @xmath45 , given the uncertainties due to unknown metallicities and the errors in our proper motion measurements ( on the order of 1.4 mas yr@xmath10 ) , these tangential velocity estimates are consistent with halo membership within the errors .",
    "we used the analytical form of the density profile for the galactic disk and the halo @xcite to calculate the expected number of stars in the udf . assuming a local normalization of 0.11 m@xmath46 pc@xmath4 @xcite",
    ", we expect to find 3 thin disk , 6 thick disk , and 20 halo stars in the udf .",
    "@xcite star count models predict 4 thin disk , 8 thick disk , and 19 halo stars , whereas the besanon galaxy model predicts 32 stars down to @xmath0 mag , including two white dwarfs .",
    "given the small field of view of the udf and the small number statistics , the observed number of stars ( 25 - 26 ) and the predictions of star count models ( 2932 ) are in good agreement .",
    "@xcite identified four white dwarf candidates in the udf , objects 4322 , 4839 , 7768 , and 9020 .",
    "our analysis shows that one of these objects , udf 4322 , is resolved , and therefore almost certainly an extra - galactic object .",
    "unfortunately , no proper motion information is available for udf 4322 to support this argument .",
    "however , its infrared colors and sed are not like any known white dwarf , and they are similar to quasars",
    ".    reduced proper motion diagrams provide a clean method for identifying white dwarfs in large surveys @xcite .",

    "udf 4839 would have a tangential velocity well in excess of 5,000 km s@xmath10  at a distance of 100 kpc .",
    "similarly , udf 9020 would have a tangential velocity well in excess of 6,000 km s@xmath10  at a distance of 443 kpc .",
    "obviously , both of these point sources must be white dwarfs .",
