    "a discovery of the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) made it clear that grbs are at cosmological distance and emit enormous energy .",
    "the spectra of grb prompt emission have been expressed empirically with a smoothly broken power - law model ( `` band function '' ) @xcite . in order to explain the huge energy and non - thermal spectral shape , models of synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons in the relativistic outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are suggested .",
    "however , sometimes the low - energy component is very hard and the power - law photon index @xmath4 in the context of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the energy , throughout this paper . ] becomes greater than the theoretical limit of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this observational fact has been explained in many ways such as non - thermal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and thermal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) models , but reasons for such hard spectra have not been understood clearly .",
    "for example , suggest that some thermal models are consistent with observed spectral characteristics of several grbs with extremely hard spectra . on the other hand , @xcite remark that `` jitter '' radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is one of possible mechanisms of reproducing spectral indices @xmath8 .",
    "a grb was triggered by swift / bat and fermi / gbm at 21:55 on 2009 september 26 .",
    "the quick results of this burst , grb090926b , are reported to gcn by the swift team @xcite and the fermi team @xcite .",
    "both of them conclude that the burst has a hard spectrum , whose photon index is @xmath9 , above the critical value of synchrotron shock models , so - called `` line of death '' .",
    "grb090926b was also observed with maxi / gsc .",
    "maxi / gsc can examine a low energy portion of the spectra of grbs below 10 kev , while swift / bat or fermi / gbm observes @xmath10 10 kev .",
    "the observational results below 10 kev may give even more severe constraints to interpretation of the spectra .",
    "in this paper , we report the observational results obtained with maxi / gsc on grb090926b , and discuss their interpretation .",
    "monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ) is a mission mounted on the international space station ( iss ) @xcite .",
    "the cameras of maxi scan x - ray sources as the iss rotates around the earth .",
    "maxi has two scientific instruments : the gas slit camera ( gsc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the solid - state slit camera ( ssc ; * ? ? ?",
    "since grb090926b was out of the ssc field of view , only the data of the gsc were available for the burst .",
    "the gsc consists of twelve one - dimensional position sensitive proportional counters sensitive to 230 kev photons .",
    "six gsc counters constitute an instantaneous field of view ( fov ) of 3@xmath11160@xmath12 pointing toward the iss motion ( gsc - h ) , and the other six counters another fov pointing to the zenith ( gsc - z ) .",
    "gsc - h and gsc - z work together and covers 85% of the whole sky every iss orbit .",
    "the transit time of a camera for a source is about 40150 s , depending on the incident angle to the camera ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "grb090926b , the second grb detected with maxi , was observed with three cameras of the gsc : camera 0 , 1 , and 7 .",
    "total effective area for these three cameras is about 14 @xmath13 at maximum .",
    "s transit time as a triangular curve . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : im ] is an image of grb090926b observed with the gsc .",
    "the gsc scanned the field from the right to the left in the image .",
    "the position localized by the gsc is reported to gcn by @xcite with an error circle of a radius of about 1 degree , which is shown in figure  [ fig : im ] .",
    "the position of the x - ray afterglow observed by swift / xrt is pointed with the `` x '' mark in the same figure .",
    "the bright region of the image is clearly shifted toward the left relative to the xrt position .",
    "this is mostly because the intensity has changed during the scan . for a steady source",
    ", a point spread function must be symmetric on the source . in the case of grb090926b ,",
    "the burst started when the source came across the fov by 1/4 , then brightened after the source passed the center of the fov .",
    "we also look into the data of other transits @xmath14 5500 s before and after the burst .",
    "we can not find any emission down to the flux limit of about @xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 ( 3@xmath18 ) in the 410 kev band for either scan . according to the swift observation of the x - ray afterglow @xcite , the energy flux at the time of the earliest maxi scan after the burst was @xmath19 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 ( 0.310 kev ) , which was below the maxi s detection limit .    for the light curve and spectral analyses , we use x - ray event data with processing version 0.3 provided by the maxi team .",
    "this data set has time resolution of @xmath20 1 ms and 1200 pi channel ( 1 pi = 0.05 kev ) .",
    "in addition to the gsc data , we use fermi / gbm archival data , in order to compensate the limited energy range of the gsc .",
    "we use _ xselect _ ver .",
    "2.4a and _ xspec _ ver .",
    "12.5.0ac for the data selection and spectral analyses , respectively .      figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] shows the light curves of grb090926b with maxi / gsc and fermi / gbm .",
    "the count rate of maxi / gsc is corrected for the effective area , which is shown in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "although maxi / gsc covered only the first 30 s of the prompt emission , the burst actually lasted for more than 50 s ; @xcite ( swift ) and @xcite ( fermi ) report the burst duration of @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s , respectively .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : lc ] , it shows a relatively hard spectrum in the first 15 s. by contrast , the spectrum becomes relatively soft in the following part of the burst .",
    "the results of the time averaged spectra of the burst observed with swift and fermi are reported to gcn by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "both teams mention that the spectrum can be fit with a cutoff power law model . @xcite",
    "integrate the spectrum in the first 48.6 s , and find the peak energy in the @xmath23 spectrum ( where @xmath24 is the energy flux at energy @xmath6 ) of @xmath25 kev and @xmath4 = -0.13 @xmath26 0.06 .",
    "@xcite adopt a longer ( 154.8 s ) integration time and find @xmath27 = 78.3 @xmath26 7.0 kev and @xmath4 = -0.52 @xmath26 0.24 .",
    "these photon indices are remarkably large , well above the line of death .",
    "since these results are derived from analyses above @xmath14 10 kev , we examine whether or not this power - law is extended to energies below 10 kev , using the maxi / gsc data .",
    "first , we extract a time averaged spectrum from @xmath281.5 to @xmath2928.5 s , where @xmath30 is the trigger time of fermi ( 2009",
    "september 26 , 21:55:28 ) . to reduce the statistical uncertainty of the photon index due to the limited energy range of the gsc",
    ", we then simultaneously fit the spectra of the gsc together with that of fermi / gbm .",
    "we test both a cutoff power law model and the empirical `` grb model '' @xcite , which has 4 free parameters , a photon index in the lower energy band @xmath4 , that in the higher band @xmath31 , a peak energy @xmath32 , and a normalization .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "to study the spectral evolution during the burst , we divide the spectra into three time intervals .",
    "as noticed from figure  [ fig : lc ] , there are two distinct peaks in the light curve in the 100350 kev band at @xmath296.5 s and @xmath2917.5 s. accordingly , the first , second , and last intervals are defined as between @xmath281.5@xmath296.5 s ( before the first peak ) , @xmath286.5@xmath2917.5 s ( in - between the two peaks ) , and @xmath2817.5@xmath2928.5 s ( after the second peak ) , respectively .",
    "the fitting results of the time resolved spectra are also summarized in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "the earlier reports on the spectral analyses of grb090926b from the swift and fermi teams suggested very flat spectra represented by a cut - off power law with a photon index of @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite , and @xmath27 of 78.3@xmath267.0 kev and 91@xmath262 kev , respectively .",
    "we confirm these results from the combined spectra of maxi / gsc and fermi / gbm .",
    "using the time averaged spectrum , we obtain the best fit cut - off power - law model with @xmath35 and @xmath27 of @xmath36 kev . the discrepancy between our result and that by the fermi team mainly comes from the difference of the time interval , rather than the energy range , used for the spectral analyses ;",
    "while @xcite utilize the first 48.6 s data , we analyze only the first 30 s after the burst .",
    "indeed , from the analysis of gbm data alone , we had the result consistent with the result of joint fit analysis , when we limit the time range to first 30 s. when the `` grb model '' is adopted , we obtain the index @xmath37 and @xmath38 kev . in either model ,",
    "the obtained @xmath4 value exceeds the line of death .",
    "moreover , the spectral parameters are peculiar among grbs .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath4 values are plotted in the scatter plot in figure  [ fig : epalpha ] together with those of the batse sample taken from @xcite .",
    "the point of grb090926b is apart from the `` main sequence '' , and has both larger @xmath4 and smaller @xmath27 compared with the majority of grbs .",
    "let us consider the mechanisms to produce such a high @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "first , we investigate the possibility that the photons are heavily absorbed somewhere between the source and the earth . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we fit the time averaged spectrum with an absorbed `` grb model '' , where the absorber is assumed to be located at redshift of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we obtain the best - fit absorption column density @xmath40 consistent with zero @xmath16 . ] and @xmath41 .",
    "since the column density is often coupled with the power - law photon index , the confidence contours in the @xmath4-n@xmath42 space are drawn in figure  [ fig : cont ] . from this figure ,",
    "a lower limit of @xmath4 is found to be @xmath43 ( 90% confidence ) , and thus we conclude that the large photon index can not be explained by an interstellar absorption",
    ".    then we have to consider the possibility that the burst has intrinsically large @xmath4 .",
    "discussed various models reproducing extremely hard spectra , including the bursts with the low - energy photon indices @xmath4 larger than @xmath44 .",
    "similar discussions are presented in @xcite about grb 020813 , which had the flattest spectrum among the bursts detected by hete-2 .",
    "they studied the case of synchrotron self absorption and synchrotron self compton as well .",
    "we can calculate the source radius and the electron number density , from the redshift @xmath45=1.24 @xcite , @xmath46 kev , and total energy of the burst @xmath47 4.3 @xmath48 ergs , following @xcite .    for the case of synchrotron self absorption",
    ", we obtain the source radius @xmath49 cm , minimum lorentz factor of relativistic electrons @xmath50 , electron number density @xmath51 @xmath52 , and magnetic field strength @xmath53 gauss .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the peak flux calculated from the above parameters is inconsistent with the observed value unless we assume unusual physical conditions of the source . for the case of synchrotron self compton",
    ", we have @xmath54 cm , @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xmath52 , and @xmath57 gauss .",
    "these results are quite similar to the results of grb020813 , and then synchrotron self compton model can not be appropriate because of the large radius .",
    "interestingly , the redshift of grb020813 @xmath58 is close to that of grb090926b ( @xmath39 ) presumably .",
    "the other parameters also agree within an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the discussion for grb020813 is also appropriate for grb090926b .    jitter radiation , which is emitted by ultra - relativistic electrons in highly nonuniform , small - scale magnetic fields , is studied as one of the mechanisms responsible for such a hard low - energy index ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite studied the observable spectral shape of the jitter radiation from various conditions of magnetic field . according to their work , despite the comprehensive search of the enormous parameter space , it is not possible to find the condition to generate an index @xmath4 larger than 0 .",
    "on the other hand , we found from the fitting results that the probability of @xmath59 is order of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of grb090926b may not be produced by jitter radiation .",
    "another possibility is that the spectrum is produced by thermal radiation .",
    "thermal components in the spectra of grb prompt emission were claimed to appear for several grbs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "some bursts showed spectra reproduced by blackbody @xmath61 power - law components , and sometimes a power - law component was not necessary to represent the observed spectra @xcite .",
    "indeed , its spectrum has a positive low - energy index and shows a narrow energy distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : eemo ] shows the spectral energy distribution of this burst . compared with a typical grb ( plotted with thin solid line )",
    ", this burst has lower @xmath27 and a steeper rising part , which is rather close to the rayleigh - jeans part of a blackbody spectrum ( plotted with thin dotted line ) .",
    "the thermal components of grbs could be considered to be a contribution of the photosphere of grb fireball .",
    "@xcite studied various cases of grb spectra based on the internal shock model consisting of a photospheric component and comptonized element by the pair plasma .",
    "following @xcite , the observable radius and temperature of the blackbody radiation from the photosphere is constant during the acceleration of the flow .",
    "therefore , if we can estimate the parameters of the blackbody , they are the parameters of the innermost part of the burst . in order to derive the photospheric radius and temperature , we test a model of simple blackbody radiation first",
    ". however , this model does not give a good fit owing to the tail - like component in the high energy part .",
    "this fact can be naturally interpreted as a temporal or a spatial superposition of the multiple temperature rather than fully adiabatic and uniform photosphere .",
    "then we adopted a model of comptonized blackbody model @xcite for the purpose of fitting both the blackbody - like component and high energy tail .",
    "the results of this fit are shown in the bottom part of table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "@xcite introduced the method to calculate the parameters of photosphere from the observed spectral parameters , under the condition that the lorentz factor of the plasma @xmath62 is directly proportional to the radius of the fireball .",
    "there is a key parameter that indicates the ratio of the observed flux and emitted flux @xmath63 where @xmath18 is stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath64 is the observed flux of the blackbody component , and @xmath65 is the observed blackbody temperature .",
    "we used the equations @xmath66^{1/4 } \\",
    ", ,   \\\\",
    "r_0 & = & \\frac{4^{3/2}}{(1.48)^{6}(1.06)^{4 } }             \\frac{d_{\\mathrm l}}{(1+z)^2 } \\left (               \\frac{f_{\\mathrm bb}^{\\mathrm ob}}{y f^{\\mathrm ob } }                \\right)^{2/3 } { \\cal r } \\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the redshift , luminosity distance to the source , thomson cross section , proton mass , and speed of light , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 is a ratio between the total fireball energy and the energy emitted in gamma - rays .",
    "the ratio of the total observed flux to the blackbody component @xmath72 depends on the energy range of integration , particularly on the upper bound , because comptonized component dominates in higher energy part .",
    "for example , @xmath73 for the upper bound of 800 kev and 1.2 for 1200 kev .",
    "consequently we introduce the renormalized parameter @xmath74 instead of @xmath71 .",
    "the luminosity distance corresponding to the measured redshift @xmath39 is @xmath75 cm under the standard condition of @xmath76 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "using the temperature of the blackbody radiation @xmath79 kev and its observed flux @xmath80 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 , we find the lorentz factor of the plasma @xmath81 , and the physical size at the base of the flow @xmath0 cm .",
    "these values are factor of a few different from the case of grb970828 , grb990510 @xcite , or grb090902b @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the observed photospheric spectrum is blackbody if the outflow energy is dominated by radiation rather than baryon up to the photospheric radius .",
    "in other words , the fireball remained optically thick when the initial acceleration was saturated .",
    "this situation occurs in the case of low baryon load .",
    "the spectrum of grb090926b may be one of the extreme example of the low baryon - load fireball .",
    "maxi gsc observed the first 30 s of grb090926b prompt emission . from the data of the scans before and after the burst",
    ", we could not find any signal of emissions with the flux limit of about 3 @xmath82 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 ( 410 kev ) for each scan .",
    "the joint spectral analysis with fermi gbm reveals that the spectrum of grb090926b shows a peculiar narrow shape . the spectral index @xmath4 of time averaged spectrum is positive .",
    "the @xmath27 of the burst is low relative to other bursts with such a hard spectral indices .",
    "this hard spectral index can not be realized by interstellar absorption , synchrotron self absorption , synchrotron self compton , nor jitter radiation .",
    "we find that the spectrum can be fit well by comptonized blackbody model .",
    "the blackbody radiation can be interpreted as a photospheric emission of the grb fireball . following the model by @xcite",
    ", we obtain the size of the base of the flow @xmath83 cm and lorentz factor of the plasma @xmath1 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the observed photospheric spectrum is blackbody if the outflow energy is dominated by radiation rather than baryon up to the photospheric radius .",
