    "qcd based arguments predict that transverse component of the cross section for the exclusive reaction @xmath4 falls off with @xmath5 while the longitudinal component falls with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "exclusive pion production can be used to check this prediction and to find out at in which kinematical regime these simple scaling laws become effective . in the following we discuss these reactions ; we draw here on our publications @xcite where further details can be found .    indeed , at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) the exclusive reaction @xmath4 has been investigated for a range of photon virtualities up to @xmath7  gev@xmath8 at an invariant mass of the @xmath9 system around the onset of deep ",
    "inelastic regime , @xmath10  gev  @xcite .",
    "a separation of the cross section into the transverse @xmath11 and longitudinal @xmath12 components has been performed .",
    "the data show that @xmath11 is large at jlab energies @xcite . at @xmath13",
    "gev@xmath8 @xmath11 is by about a factor of two larger than @xmath12 , constrary to the qcd - based expectations , and at @xmath14  gev@xmath8 it has same size as @xmath12 .",
    "previous measurements at values of @xmath15  gev@xmath8  @xcite show a similar problem in the understanding of @xmath11 . even at smaller jlab  @xcite and much higher cornell  @xcite and desy  @xcite values of @xmath16 there is a disagreement between the simple scaling expectations and experimental data .    the longitudinal cross section @xmath12 is well understood in terms of the pion quasi  elastic knockout mechanism  @xcite because of the pion pole at low @xmath17 .",
    "this makes it possible to study the charge form factor of the pion at momentum transfer much bigger than in the scattering of pions from atomic electrons  @xcite .",
    "however , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on such a picture and which is generally considered to be a guideline for the experimental analysis and extraction of the pion form factor , underestimates @xmath11 at @xmath14  gev@xmath8 and at @xmath18  gev@xmath8 by about one order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can be represented by the three amplitudes shown in fig .  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the leftmost reggeized @xmath19-channel term dominates the longitudinal strength which thus always dominates at forward momenta , with relatively small contributions from vector meson exchange ( middle graph ) .",
    "the right graph , involving a nucleon - pole @xmath20-channel diagram , is necessary for gauge invariance ; its main , but small , contribution is to the transverse cross section . at the kinematics of the relevant electroproduction experiments the energies are high enough to excite also nucleon resonances ;",
    "the invariant masses of the @xmath21 system are between approximately 2 and 4 gev .",
    "we identify these high - lying resonances with partonic excitations leading to dis @xcite and invoke the continuity in going from an inclusive final dis state to the exclusive pion production @xcite . during this transition",
    "the transverse strength of dis remains intact .",
    "we thus expect that the inclusion of these resonance excitations into the @xmath20-channel diagram enhances the transverse scattering while leaving the longitudinal strength originating in the @xmath19-channel diagram intact .",
    "adding such a resonance ( dis ) component to the @xmath22__channel + born model _ _ of @xcite constitutes the central point of our theory which also contains an improved treatment of gauge invariance accounting for the difference in the electromagnetic formfactors for pions and protons @xcite .",
    "the natural point to add the resonance contributions is in the rightmost diagram of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] that depicts the so - called born graph , i.e.  a @xmath20-channel graph with an intermediate nucleon in the original theory of ref .",
    "the resonance excitations are also @xmath20-channel contributions which  because of their special coupling  are gauge invariant by themselves @xcite . in the experiments quoted the invariant masses of the @xmath23 system",
    "are all @xmath3 gev , i.e.  they all lie above the region of well - established , separated nucleon resonances .",
    "thus , the born term becomes a sum over individual resonances that can be replaced by an integral over resonances with average coupling constants and form factors @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electromagnetic and strong couplings , respectively , and @xmath27 is the electromagnetic form factor . here @xmath28 is the density of resonances with mass @xmath29 .",
    "so far unknown are here the couplings @xmath30 and @xmath31 and the form factors @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ sumres ] ) .",
    "our aim is to maintain the transverse character of dis , which follows from a parton picture , when going to the exclusive limit of a resonance decay .",
    "we thus have to establish a connection between these two pictures .",
    "bloom and gilman @xcite have shown that the total dis strength follows closely the average behavior of nucleon resonances ( for a more recent review see also @xcite ) .",
    "we , therefore , now use this bloom and gilman duality in its local form @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for the bjorken scaling variable and the deep inelastic structure function @xmath35 is expressed as a sum of resonances .",
    "@xmath36 defines the @xmath37th resonance contribution to the @xmath38 forward scattering amplitude ; it is essentially the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath25 times the resonance form factor @xmath39 .",
    "( [ bg ] ) links the partonic content of nucleon resonances with their hadronic structure . since the density of resonances in eq .",
    "( [ sumres ] ) is a steeply increasing function of invariant mass , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) that the electromagnetic coupling to nucleon resonances must be decreasing with mass since @xmath40 is finite .",
    "this leads to a natural cut - off for the number of resonances and makes the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sumres ] ) finite .    in a further step the combined nucleon - resonance contribution to the s - channel",
    "is absorbed into an effective born - term with a nucleon pole only , but a modified form factor @xmath41 which now contains all the effects of the resonances @xmath42 parametrizing the form factor in a dipole form leads to the conclusion that the cut - off must increase with the mass of the resonance @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , expect that the effective form factor @xmath41 is considerably harder than that of the nucleon alone .",
    "this is indeed born out by the calculations as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f1onoff ] .",
    "( color online ) the @xmath16 dependence of the absolute value of the transition form factor @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ sumres ] ( dashed curve ) at @xmath44  gev .",
    "the solid curve describes the proton dirac form factor in comparison with data . from @xcite . ]",
    "[ horn1 ] shows the results of the calculations in comparison with the data of ref .",
    "@xcite for all four cross sections .",
    "the solid lines that represent the results of our calculations describe all cross sections , the longitudinal , the transverse and the interference ones , very well .",
    "the transverse strength is nearly entirely built up by the resonance contributions that are considerably bigger and fall off much more weakly with @xmath16 than the ones obtained from the nucleon born term alone ( see fig .",
    "[ f1onoff ] ) .",
    "the resonances also contribute about 30% to the longitudinal cross section at forward angles ( small @xmath17 ) where the major contribution comes from the @xmath19-channel graph with the nucleon born term alone . for the interference cross sections @xmath45 and @xmath46 the sign even changes when the resonances are taken into account .        in fig .",
    "[ effhermes ] we show that this very same picture also works remarkably well at the much higher momentum transfers @xmath16 and invariant masses @xmath47 reached in the hermes experiment @xcite . even in the kinematical windows",
    "@xmath48 gev@xmath8 the difference between the dash - dash - dotted curve ( no resonance contributions ) and the dashed curve ( resonances included ) shows the dramatic impact of the resonance contributions which are essential in describing the cross section at larger @xmath17 .",
    "as the hermes kinematics are quite close to those expected for jlab at 12 gev we predict that again high - lying resonances determine the transverse cross sections at larger @xmath17 .",
    "fig .  23 in ref .",
    "@xcite detailed predictions for the @xmath49 separated cross sections are given both for @xmath50 and @xmath51 production .",
    "in particular we predict that @xmath51 production is largely longitudinal .",
    "this model has recently been extended to the photo- and electroproduction of @xmath52 @xcite ; again a very good description of all available data is reached without any new parameters . the transition from photoproduction ( @xmath53 )",
    "to electroproduction shows that the resonance contributions assume a larger and larger role with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "while at the photon point they just fill in the diffractive dip in the otherwise regge - dominated cross section at higher @xmath16 they become more and more dominant .",
    "the large transverse strength observed in various experiments on exclusive pion production has been a long - standing puzzle .",
    "we have resolved this open problem by adding to the usual @xmath19__-channel + born _ _ term description the contribution of high - lying nucleon resonances as an effective description of dis excitations . by using quark - hadron duality we have been able to link the properties of these resonances to the partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus treat this contribution to the exclusive production as the limiting case of inclusive dis processes that are predominantly transverse .",
    "such a model , that makes use only of quite general average properties of nucleon resonances , is able to describe all the available exclusive electroproduction data for pions .",
    "in particular the transverse response of nucleons is determined by their resonance / parton excitations ."
