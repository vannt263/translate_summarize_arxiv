    "the major experiments at the large hadron collider @xcite , depending on specific physics requirements , have detector setups of different geometrical acceptance for detecting several kinds of particles in different kinematic ranges . beside the specific physics goals ,",
    "all these detector setups facilitate study of the physics of the collisions , in general , by implicitly recording information on particle productions in terms of a few basic observables .",
    "sometimes , comparisons of data recorded in different acceptance of detectors of these experiments could provide insights to the particle production mechanisms in different phase - space of collisions , due to different kinematic origin . in this respect , out of the four major experiments at the lhc , the large hadron collider beauty ( lhcb ) experiment has a unique standing . while a large ion collider experiment ( alice )",
    ", the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment and a toroidal lhc apparatus ( atlas ) experiment primarily address the mid - rapidity physics by measuring majority of the produced charged particles in the mid - rapidity region , the lhcb setup allows measurement of charged particles in the forward rapidity region , facilitating the study of forward physics .",
    "the multiplicity distribution of primary charged particles produced in collisions is one of the most basic observables , characterizing the final states of multi - particle production process in a high energy physics experiment .",
    "all the lhc experiments have measured @xcite multiplicity distributions in proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) - collisions at the available lhc energies in different kinematic ranges and for different classes of events . in the context of the present work ,",
    "these lhc experiments , in spite of the differences in detector acceptance , have a common observation - the multiplicity distributions of produced particles at the new lhc energies have been found to be underestimated by several of the standard event generators / models ( like pythia , phojet etc . ) in use .",
    "this observation has made the study of multiplicity distribution at lhc energies all the more interesting .",
    "in this article , we analyze the primary charged particle multiplicity distributions in the forward rapidity region in proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) - collisions at @xmath2 = 7 tev , as measured by the lhcb experiment at lhc , in terms of parameters of the negative binomial distribution(nbd ) function . the two - parameter nbd function , as given below in eq .",
    "- ( 1 ) played a significant role in describing multiplicity distributions of produced charged particles in the mid - rapidity region in @xmath1 ( and @xmath5 ) collisions for a wide range of the centre - of - mass energy , including @xmath2 = 7 tev .",

    "however , the single nbd function could describe the data only for small pseudorapidity intervals at the mid - rapidity region . with the appearance of sub - structures in multiplicity distributions at higher energies and in larger pseudorapidity intervals",
    ", the weighted superposition or convolution of more than one function including one nbd function , as proposed by several models , @xcite representing more than one source or process of particle productions could explain the data better . such sub - structure in sps data at @xmath17 900 gev and in tevatron data at @xmath17 1.8 tev @xcite",
    "could be well explained by weighted superposition of two nbd functions @xcite , as given by eq .",

    "the other parameters , functions of both , the @xmath2 and the @xmath20 , have usual meanings as described for eq . - ( 1 ) with suffixes in parameters indicating respective components .    at this point , discussing other models or approaches of multi - particle production involving nbds",
    "would be relevant .",
    "the framework of the weighted superposition mechanism of different classes of events has been extended from the two - component to a three component model @xcite for explaining possible new physics at lhc at @xmath2 = 14 tev .",
    "the third component would attribute to the eventual new class of high multiplicity events which would be manifested by the appearance of a new elbow structure in the tail of multiplicity distribution of the @xmath1 collisions at the highest planned centre - of - mass energy at the lhc .",
    "so far , the multiplicity distributions for the @xmath1 collisions up to @xmath2 = 7 tev are available and these distributions have no such new structure , in the tail of the distributions , which calls for application of the model . a very recent theoretical approach @xcite , following glasma flux tube model , has shown that the multiplicity distribution of multi - particle production could be described by convolution of a number of nbd functions as a natural consequence of several impact parameters of the collisions .",
    "the model reproduces the multiplicity distributions data of @xmath1 collisions in small pseudorapidity window ( @xmath21 0.5 ) at the lhc energies .",
    "the scope of the present work is , however , restricted to the analysis of the lhcb data in terms of a single nbd and a superposition of two nbds , as prescribed by the two - component model of ref .",
    "@xcite .    according to the two - component model of ref.- @xcite",
    ", the multiplicity distribution of hadronic collisions can be explained by weighted superposition of two nbds , representing two classes of events , `` semihard - events with minijets or jets '' and `` soft - events without minijets or jets '' .",
    "it is note worthy that the `` semihard '' events involving hard parton - parton scatterings ( due to high momentum transfer ) resulting in qcd jets of high transverse momentum above a certain threshold is also referred to as `` hard - qcd '' events .",
    "the lhcb experiment has measured @xcite multiplicity distributions of primary charged particles produced in the @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2 = 7 tev in the pseudo rapidity coverages , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for two classes of events : the minimum bias and the hard - qcd .",
    "the hard - qcd events were chosen out of the minimum bias events by selecting events with at least one particle with transverse momentum greater than 1 gev / c .",
    "the multiplicity distributions for both the event - classes were measured for small pseudo rapidity windows of width @xmath24 scanning over the @xmath14 - range of the detector coverage as well as for the wide @xmath14 - window , @xmath25 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we analyze these distributions in the forward - rapidity in terms of the nbd that has been successful in describing the mid - rapidity data .",
    "we discuss the results , comparing with observations in similar analysis of data at the same @xmath2 at the mid - rapidity region .",
    "for the mid - rapidity region , we consider the distributions , measured by the cms experiment @xcite , as there exists @xcite similar phenomenological study of the cms data in terms of the nbd - formalism .",
    "we fit the multiplicity distributions of primary charged particles , as measured @xcite by the lhcb , in the five pseudorapidity windows of width @xmath24 in the @xmath14 - range , @xmath23 for the minimum bias events with the nbd function as given in eq . -1 .",
    "the table -  [ tab : nbd_minbias ] contains the values of the parameters obtained by the best fits , along with the the corresponding values of @xmath26 .",
    ".values of parameters of nbd functions as obtained by fitting the multiplicity distributions for the primary charged particles in minimum bias events in @xmath1 - collisions at @xmath2 = 7 tev for five small @xmath14-windows .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have analyzed the multiplicity distributions of primary charged particles in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2 = 7 tev , as measured by the lhcb experiment at the lhc .",
    "the lhcb has measured the multiplicity distributions in several small ( @xmath27 0.5 ) pseudorapidity windows mostly in the forward @xmath14 - region , @xmath23 , as well as in a large @xmath14 - window ( @xmath27 2.5 ) for two classes of events , the minimum bias and the hard - qcd .",
    "the distributions have been analyzed in terms of the nbd function .",
    "for the minimum bias events , we observe that the distributions in both the small and the large pseudorapidity windows could be better described by the weighted superposition of two - nbds than a single nbd function - a feature similar to what has been exhibited by the multiplicity distributions of primary charged hadrons produced in the mid - rapidity region in the @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2 = 7 tev .",
    "the reasonable good fits of the single nbd to the multiplicity distributions for the `` hard '' events in small @xmath14 - windows also are more - or - less in agreement with the two component model of the so - called `` hard '' and `` soft '' particle productions .",
    "but , the need of a similar function formed by the weighted superposition of two nbds in describing multiplicity distribution of the `` hard '' events in the large @xmath14 - window contradicts the concept of the discussed two - component model .",
    "on the basis of the finding that the multiplicity distribution of `` hard '' events in large @xmath14 - window deviates appreciably from a single nbd and requires weighted superposition of two nbds , one may conclude that the discussed two - component model @xcite does not conform fully with the multiplicity distribution in the forward - rapidity region of @xmath1 collisions at @xmath2 = 7 tev .",
    "the finding could be attributed either to biased selection criterion of the hard events or to the possibility of different particle production mechanism in different phase space .",
    "it is worth discussing at this point that there exists no specific orthogonal variable , as yet , to separate the `` soft '' and the `` hard '' events in @xmath1 collisions . isolating the `` hard '' ( `` soft '' ) events on the basis of having at least one ( no ) particle with the transverse momentum or transverse energy greater than a certain given value",
    "is a data driven approach and may inherit some biases , which need corrections .",
    "the selection criterion of the hard interaction events at lhcb resulted the geometrical acceptance no longer independent of momentum and the distributions were accordingly corrected by the collaboration @xcite . in this study , we have analyzed the corrected distributions .    to conclude on the possibility of different particle production mechanism at different phase space ,",
    "direct comparison of similar analysis in the mid - rapidity and in the forward - rapidity is essential .",
    "our study with the minimum bias events at the forward rapidity and comparison of the related results with similar study with the mid - rapidity data @xcite do not indicate to the possibility of different particle production mechanism , in the framework of the two - component model .",
    "the results of our analysis with the hard - qcd events , on the other hand , could not be compared with the mid - rapidity data as there exists no measured multiplicity distribution for `` hard '' events in the mid - rapidity region at lhc . in the present scenario , similar analysis of isolated `` hard '' events of @xmath1 collisions in the mid - rapidity region",
    "would be useful to obtain a comprehensive picture on the role of the discussed two - component model vis - a - vis the multiplicity distributions in different phase space in @xmath1 collisions at the lhc energies .",
    "also , other theoretical and phenomenological approaches @xcite , successful in describing the data at the mid - rapidity , may be compared with the lhcb data at the forward rapidity region . in reference",
    "@xcite , the cms data @xcite at the mid - rapidity have been successfully described in the framework of independent pair parton interaction ( ippi ) @xcite and in terms of quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite that fits better to the data than the ippi model .",
    "the mid - rapidity data have been analyzed @xcite also in the light of another multiple scattering model of particle production , the dual parton model ( dpm ) .",
    "note : during the review process of this article , we came across an article @xcite that reports analysis of minimum bias multiplicity distributions measured by all the experiments at the lhc by weighted superposition of three nbd functions .",
