    "the f - doped lnfeaso ( ln = rare - earth elements ) , which has been abbreviated as 1111 phase , is the first reported family with the highest critical transition temperature @xmath0 in bulk in the fe - based superconductors ( fescs ) .",
    "@xcite however , investigations on the physical properties of 1111-type fescs are restricted remarkably , compared with the 122 phase and 11 phase , due to the difficulties in obtaining sizable single crystals .",
    "as we know , it is essential to have high - quality single crystals when carrying out many experiments , including the measurements of electrical transport , inelastic neutron diffraction , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy , and so on . during the past several years , many efforts have been made to improve the quality and size of the single crystals .",
    "nacl and kcl were first used as the flux and small single crystals with sizes of 20 - 70 @xmath1 m can be obtained .",
    "@xcite then more attempts , including the high - pressure method and the naas - flux method ,  @xcite were made to further improve the growth processes .",
    "up to now , the two goals , sizable and high - quality , are still not achieved commendably .",
    "recently , single crystals with the size of several millimeters were reported to be accessible in f - vacant and na - doped cafeasf ,  @xcite which is another type of 1111 phase without oxygen ,  @xcite possibly due to the decrease of melting point in this fluorine - based system .",
    "as we know , a rather high @xmath0 above 50 k can also be achieved by doping in this fluorine - based 1111 system .",
    "@xcite more important information can be obtained owning to the availability of the sizable single crystals . to our knowledge , the investigations on the single crystals of the parent phase cafeasf are still lacking .",
    "here we present the growth , structure , and transport measurements of the high - quality cafeasf single crystals with the sizes of 1 - 2 mm .",
    "the single crystals were grown by the self - flux method .",
    "the structure details were obtained from the refinement of the single - crystal x - ray diffraction data . the structural transition at 121 k",
    "was confirmed by the resistivity , magnetoresistance , and magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "a feature coming from the antiferromagnetic transition was also observed in the resistivity data .",
    "high quality cafeasf single crystals were grown using the self - flux method with caas as the flux .",
    "first , the starting materials ca granules ( purity 99 .",
    "5% , alfa aesar ) and as grains ( purity 99.995% , alfa aesar ) were mixed in 1 : 1 ratio .",
    "then the mixture was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and followed by a heating process at 700@xmath2c for 10 h to get the caas precursor .",
    "caas , fef2 powder ( purity 99% , alfa aesar ) and fe powder ( purity 99+% , alfa aesar ) were mixed together in the stoichiometric ratio 10 : 1 : 1 , and the mixture were placed in a crucible .",
    "finally , the crucible was sealed in a quartz tube with vacuum .",
    "all the weighing and mixing procedures were carried out in a glove box with a protective argon atmosphere .",
    "the quartz tube was heated at 950@xmath2c for 40 hours firstly , and then it was heated up to 1230@xmath2c and stay for 20 hours .",
    "finally it was cooled down to 900@xmath2c at a rate of 2@xmath2c /h and followed by a quick cooling down to room temperature .",
    "the microstructure was examined by the scanning electron microscopy ( sem , zeiss supra55 ) .",
    "the composition of the single crystals was checked and determined by the energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) measurements on an oxford instruments .",
    "the crystals were first checked using a dx-2700 type powder x - ray diffractometer .",
    "the detailed structure was characterized and analyzed by the single - crystal x - ray diffraction measurements on a bruker d8 focus diffractometer equipped with the graphite - monochromatized mo @xmath3 radiation .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility measurement was carried out on the magnetic property measurement system ( quantum design , mpms 3 ) .",
    "the electrical resistance and magnetoresistance ( mr ) were measured using a four - probe technique on the physical property measurement system ( quantum design , ppms ) with magnetic field up to 9 t. for the mr measurements , the magnetic field was oriented parallel to the c axis of the samples and the data were measured for both positive and negative field orientations to eliminate the effect of the hall signals .",
    "a typical dimension of the single crystals is 1.2@xmath41.0@xmath40.1 mm@xmath5 .",
    "the morphology was examined by the scanning electron microscopy . an sem picture for the cafeasf single crystal",
    "can be seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) , which shows the flat surface and some terrace - like features .",
    "an enlarged view of this picture can be seen in fig .",
    "the composition of the crystals was characterized by energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) measurements .",
    "we measured the eds at different positions of the sample . here",
    "we show a typical result in fig .",
    "1(c ) and table i , which revealed that the ratio of ca : fe : as is close to the stoichiometric ratio .",
    "the content of the light element f is difficult to determine precisely based on eds measurements .",
    "the structure of the crystals was first check by a powder x - ray diffractometer , where the x - ray was incident on the ab - plane of the crystal .",
    "the diffraction pattern is shown in fig .",
    "all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the tetragonal zrcusias - type structure ( see the inset of fig .",
    "2 ) . only sharp peaks along ( 00l ) orientation",
    "can be observed , suggesting a high c - axis orientation .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the diffraction peaks is only about 0.10@xmath2 after deducting the @xmath6 contribution , indicating a rather fine crystalline quality .",
    "the c - axis lattice constant was obtained to be 8.584  by analyzing the diffraction data .",

    "the inset is the schematic of the crystal structure of cafeasf.,width=332 ]    .parameters for the data collection and structure refinement of cafeasf .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ tab.4 ]    we used the high - resolution single - crystal x - ray diffraction to study the structural details of our sample .",
    "the diffraction data were collected at room temperature by the @xmath7- and @xmath8-scan method .",
    "the crystal structure was solved by shelxs-2014 and refined by shelx-2014 .",
    "@xcite the parameters for the data collection and structure refinement are listed in table ii .",
    "the values of r@xmath9 and wr@xmath10 are much smaller than the previously reported polycrystalline results ,  @xcite and also small compared to the na - doped single crystalline system ,  @xcite indicating the high - quality of our sample and the reliability of our refinements .",
    "as shown in table iii , the final cell constants are determined to be @xmath11 = @xmath12 = 3.8774(4 )  , c = 8.5855(10 )  .",
    "it is clear that the c - axis lattice constants are very close to that obtained from the data in fig .",
    "2 . in addition",
    ", the a- and c - axis lattice constants determined from our experiment are consistent with the polycrystalline samples reported previously .",
    "@xcite compared to the na - doped single crystalline samples , the a - axis lattice constant is similar while the c - axis constant is clearly smaller .",
    "@xcite the anion ( as ) height relative to fe layer is a bit larger than the optimal value ( 1.38  ) for the highest @xmath0 in fescs .",
    "@xcite the atomic coordinates from the refinement are shown in table iv , which also confirm the structure obtained earlier on the basis of powder data , with a difference of about 0.16% for the c - axis position of as element .  @xcite the bond angles @xmath13 deviate a bit from the optimal value of about 109.47@xmath2 .        the resistivity , mr , and magnetic susceptibility change the variation tendency at the same temperature 121 k on the temperature dependent curves , as revealed in figs .",
    "3(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) .",
    "this seems to be a common feature in most of the fescs , associated with the structure and the spin - density - wave ( sdw)-type antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "this transition temperature is a little higher than the polycrystalline results ( 118 - 120 k ) .",
    "@xcite temperature dependence of resistivity are shown in fig .",
    "above 121 k , the resistivity increases almost linearly with the decrease of temperature .",
    "we note that it is rather conflicting about this behavior , among different repots based on polycrystalline samples .",
    "@xcite only one result reported on srfeasf by tegel et al .",
    "shows similar tendency , compared with our data .",
    "@xcite we argue that the data from single - crystal samples reveals the intrinsic properties since the scattering processes are not affected by the grain boundaries . moreover , the transition at 121 k is sharper than the results from polycrystalline samples .",
    "below that temperature , the resistivity decreases with cooling and a clear kink can be observed at about 110 k , as indicated by the green dashed line .",
    "these two characteristic temperatures with the interval of 11 k are reminiscent of the reported @xmath14 = 150 k and @xmath15 = 138 k in the another 1111 phase lnfeaso ( ln = la , ce ) ,  @xcite where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the transition temperatures from tetragonal to orthogonal structure and that from paramagnetic to sdw - type antiferromagnetic phase , respectively .",
    "we note that such two distinct transition temperatures have also been detected from the resistivity data in the co - doped bafe@xmath10as@xmath10 system .",
    "@xcite so it is very likely that these two transition temperatures are @xmath14 = 121 k and @xmath15 = 110 k for the present cafeasf system .    in is paper ,",
    "mr is expressed as @xmath16/\\rho_0 $ ] , where @xmath17(9 t ) and @xmath18 are the resistivity under the field 9 t and zero field , respectively . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we show temperature dependence of mr .",
    "the magnitude of mr decreases with the increase of the temperature monotonously until @xmath14 and vanishes above this temperature .",
    "these observations suggest that the mr in this system is associated with the magnetic and electronic structures , which are affected by the structure and the sdw - type antiferromagnetic transitions remarkably .",
    "the transition on the @xmath19 curve shows the feature of an antiferromagnetic transition , as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) . in the high temperature",
    "non - magnetic normal state , a linear - temperature - dependent behavior can be observed .",
    "this is a non - curie - weiss - like paramagnetic behavior and can not be understood within a simple mean - field picture",
    ". this behavior should be very important to understand the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity because it was also observed in undoped and highly underdoped cuprates .",
    "@xcite in the pnictide compounds , this feature was interpreted by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations with the local sdw correlations .",
    "in summary , high - quality and sizable single crystals of cafeasf were grown successfully by the self - flux method .",
    "the single - crystal x - ray diffraction measurements were carried out and the structure details were refined based on the data .",
    "the resistivity , magnetoresistance , and magnetic susceptibility show clear different behaviors below and above 121 k. the critical temperatures of the structure and antiferromagnetic transition were determined to be @xmath14 = 121 k and @xmath15 = 110 k , respectively .",
    "our results supply a platform to study the intrinsic properties of the 1111 phase of fescs .",
