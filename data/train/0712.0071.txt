    "atomic nuclei form a network of coupled systems communicating with each other through decays and captures @xcite .",
    "if continuum states are neglected , this communication is broken and each system becomes an isolated closed quantum system ( cqs ) .",
    "it is obvious , that the cqs description of atomic nuclei ( e.g. the nuclear shell model ( sm ) ) becomes self - contradictory for weakly - bound or unbound states .",
    "a classic example of a continuum coupling is the thomas - ehrmann shift @xcite which manifests itself in the asymmetry in the energy spectra between mirror nuclei having different particle emission thresholds . a consistent description of the interplay between scattering states , resonances , and bound state requires an open quantum system ( oqs ) formulation .",
    "comprehensive many - body theory of weakly bound / unbound states has been advanced recently in the time - asymmetric quantum mechanics using the complete ensemble of single - particle states consisting of resonant ( gamow ) states and the complex - energy , non - resonant continuum of scattering states from which the complete many - body basis of oqss can be obtained @xcite .",
    "another formulation of the continuum shell model is obtained by embedding standard sm in the continuum of decay channels .",

    ", we study the effect of the continuum coupling on spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mirror nuclei .",
    "we show that the continuum coupling explains naturally not only the appearance of the asymmetry in spectra but also provides a major part of the thomas - ehrmann shift",
    ". we shall also discuss salient effects of a continuum coupling in the binding energy systematics , in particular the anti - odd - even staggering ( anti - oes ) and the effective range of energies in which various decay channels are correlated with each other with the discrete many - body states changing significantly their energy and wave function .",
    "in the shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec ) , nucleus is described as an oqs @xcite .",
    "the total function space consists of the set of @xmath3-functions , as in the standard sm , and the set of scattering states ( decay channels ) .",
    "these two sets are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for discrete states of the closed subsystem ( closed quantum system ( cqs ) ) : @xmath4 and for scattering states of the external environment : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the sm hamiltonian , and @xmath7 is the coupled - channel ( cc ) hamiltonian .",

    "in this paper , we attempted to address two problems pertaining to the physics with exotic , weakly - bound nuclei : ( i ) what are the generic features of the continuum coupling in binding systematics of neutron - rich nuclei ?",
    "( ii ) can one explain mirror - symmetry breaking effects in spectra by the asymmetry of threshold energies in mirror nuclei ?",
    "the answers to these questions are not simple and require further investigations .",
    "studies in long chains of oxygen and fluorine isotopes revealed that the @xmath47 residual coupling to the scattering continuum becomes strongly reduced with respect to the @xmath48 coupling in the vicinity of the neutron drip line .",
    "the @xmath47 coupling is essential for an understanding of the anti - oes effect which is seen in odd-@xmath66 fluorine chain and leads to an apparent reduction of the gap parameter for neutrons .",
    "hence , in weakly - bound nuclei close to the drip lines , the oes has three components : the first one originates from nucleonic pairing , the second one is the deformed mean - field effect @xcite , and the third one originates from the @xmath47 coupling via scattering continuum .",
    "one should stress that the latter component is of a completely different nature than the singular behavior of binding energies originating from the @xmath47 correlations near @xmath99 line @xcite .",
    "asymmetry in the spectra of mirror systems is another playground for the continuum shell model . in the mirror couple @xmath1-@xmath2 , a relative shift of @xmath0 excitation energies can be to a large extent directly related to the effect of the continuum coupling .",
    "however , in contrast to neutron - rich nuclei , the low one - proton separation energy in @xmath1 has little influence on the difference of excitation energies of @xmath0 states in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the coulomb barrier which suppresses continuum - coupling effects in weakly - bound systems close to the proton drip line . in that respect ,",
    "weakly - bound / unbound systems at the proton drip line are radically different from those at the neutron drip line .",
    "to understand dissimilarity of nuclear systems at the proton and neutron drip lines is a challenge for the nuclear structure theory .",
