    "despite the impressive success of the standard model ( sm ) in describing all experimental data , it contains many unsolved problems , such as , origin of mass and cp violation , hierarchy problem , number of generations , baryon anti - baryon asymmetry , etc . for solution of these problems",
    "it is necessary to go beyond sm . to obtain a `` natural '' solution to hierarchy problem little higgs models @xcite",
    "are introduced . in little higgs models new physics",

    "there are several variations which differ in the assumed higher symmetry group and in the representation of the scalar multiplets , one of which is the littlest higgs model@xcite .",
    "the existence of new particles in littlest higgs model includes new heavy gauge bosons and a new scalar sector consisting of a neutral heavy scalar ( @xmath4 ) , a neutral pseudo - scalar ( @xmath5 ) , a singly charged scalar ( @xmath6 ) and a doubly charged scalar ( @xmath7 ) receives special attention .",
    "the charged scalars @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the littlest higgs model are under special interest since they have distinct signatures in future colliders .",
