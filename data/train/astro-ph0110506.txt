    "a small sample of detached ebs provide accurate individual mass and radius ( andersen 1991 ) . as stressed by many authors ( see e.g. clausen 1993 ) , [ fe / h ] is the main remaining uncertainty of these stars , and their t@xmath0 are inhomogeneously determined ( lastennet et al .",
    "1999 , llwb99 ) .",
    "the determination of these two last parameters is motivating because the knowledge of all possible stellar parameters for such stars is the basis of the modelling of the global physical properties and evolution of star clusters or galaxies . in this context",
    ", the present work follows llwb99 to determine metallicity - dependent t@xmath0s of non - interacting ebs from strmgren photometry .",
    "table 1 gives the individual strmgren photometry and surface gravity we used for our working sample .",
    "this sample covers a wide mass range , from 1.198 ( ux men b ) to 27.27 m@xmath2 ( v3903 sgr a ) . to be consistent with the llwb99 work we only kept ebs with ( b@xmath3y ) , m@xmath4 and c@xmath4 data .",
    "the other commonly used strmgren index @xmath5 - not affected by interstellar reddening or the distance of the stars - would provide another observational constraint , however we decided to exclude it from our study .",
    "the reason is twofold : first , determinations for both components of a system are not always available ( mainly due to the narrow bandpass of the h@xmath6 filters ) , and secondly , the synthetic @xmath5 index from the basel models is not reliable because - by construction - the resolution of flux distributions is 10 - 20 @xmath7 ( see lastennet 1998 for a proposed correction ) .",
    "while only binaries with photometric errors were considered in llwb99 , here we consider systems with no photometric errors published , except for hs hya and v906 sco .",
    "for the case were these errors are supplied , the mean values are @xmath8@xmath9@xmath100.013 , @xmath8@xmath11@xmath100.022 and @xmath8@xmath12@xmath100.027 .",

    "we apply a @xmath1-minimization method on the basel models ( lejeune et al .",
    "1998 , see also lastennet , lejeune & cuisinier , these proceedings ) to derive the t@xmath0 and [ fe / h ] values matching simultaneously the observed strmgren photometry , the surface gravity ( log g ) being fixed to its accurately determined value ( see llwb99 for details ) .",
    "all the @xmath1-scores are bad ( @xmath27 10 ) , except for both components of the system @xmath1 hya : its primary component gives a very good agreement with previous t@xmath0 determinations , but we favour a t@xmath0 larger by @xmath28 700k for @xmath1 hya b ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . of course",
    ", the @xmath1-scores are related to the assumed photometric errors , so largest errors should give better ( i.e. smaller ) @xmath1 values .",
    "the 2 binaries with published photometric errors ( hs hya and v760 sco ) give bad fit as well .",
    "further study is needed , as well as more information on the observed strmgren data before definitive conclusion .",
    "reasons for these discrepancies could be that : * 1 ) * the basel models are not fit to predict strmgren indices .",
    "this explanation is possible because some problems due to the m@xmath4 and c@xmath4 indices were detected for f - type stars with the basel strmgren synthetic photometry ( lastennet et al .",
    "however , only ux men and hs hya contain f - type stars , so this can not be a general explanation for our sample .",
    "moreover , only @xmath2817% ( 7 over 40 ) of the stars studied by llwb99 presented a similar bad fit ( and this was not correlated with a particular t@xmath0 range ) against @xmath2891% ( 20 over 22 ) in the present sample .",
    "another convincing point against unreliable results from the basel strmgren synthetic photometry is that among the 9 f - type stars studied by llwb99 , only 2 stars show bad fits . *",
    "2 ) * the differential reddening in the direction of these stars is strongly different from the standard values that we adopt . a comparison between the reddening found in the literature and derived from basel ( tab .",
    "1 ) show a good agreement , except for sz cen a but even in this case the disagreement is only of 0.058 mag . *",
    "3 ) * the choice of b@xmath3y , m@xmath4 and c@xmath4 is not critical enough for the purpose of this work .",
    "when it is true that b@xmath3y becomes increasingly insensitive to t@xmath0 for the hotter stars ( for ( b@xmath3y)@xmath29@xmath300 ) , it appears that even in this defavorable range basel is able to predict good results ( e.g. em car or cw cep in llwb99 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that even bad fits give results in agreement with previous studies .",
    "another unexpected ( because badly fitted ) but interesting result is obtained for qx car : we predict a rich metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath270.30 ( 0.15 ) from the primary ( secondary ) ) which is in agreement with previous estimates : lastennet ( 1998 ) ( z@xmath100.04 from 2 different stellar models , i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath280.39 ) , and the extrapolated result of ribas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( z@xmath100.035 , i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath280.32 ) . *",
    "4 ) * the observed colors of these stars are in some way erroneous and should be carefully re - determined from new photometric observations .      when bad fits were obtained using all the photometric data ( 3 colours ) , llwb99 considered the solutions derived from the combination of 2 colours .",
    "in this case , the results match - all with success - ( b@xmath3y ) and c@xmath4 simultaneously ( e.g. fig .",
    "1 , right upper panel ) . a comparison of t@xmath0(basel ) with previous studies shows a general good agreement , but t@xmath0(basel ) are slightly but systematically lower .",
    "unfortunately , few information is derived for [ fe / h ] , all the range considered being virtually possible inside the 1-@xmath8 contours .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "1 ( lower panels ) the solutions obtained from the b@xmath3y index alone for the 2 only systems with photometric errors .",
    "the t@xmath0 determinations show a perfect agreement with previous works . a precise spectroscopic determination of the hs hya metallicity is needed but if one assumes the value of [ fe / h]@xmath310.17 ( torres et al . ,",
    "1997 ) , then we predict t@xmath0 in the range 6380 - 6440 k ( primary ) and 6320 - 6380 k ( secondary ) .",
    "these t@xmath0s are slightly lower than the results of torres et al . :",
