    "after the introduction of the seminal concept of _ pseudocodewords _ @xcite,@xcite it is now ascertained that these errors are caused by small subsets of nodes of the tanner graph that act as attractors for iterative decoders , even if they are not the support of valid codewords .",

    "ass behavior depends on the decoder quantization and in @xcite they are classified as _ weak _ or",
    "_ strong _ depending on whether they can be resolved or not by properly tuning the decoder dynamics . in @xcite",
    "the same research group proposes a postprocessing method to resolve ass , once the iterative decoder is trapped .    in @xcite",
    "the author defines _ absorption sets _",
    "( equivalent to ass ) and identifies a variety of ass for the ldpc code used in the ieee 802.3an standard .",
    "the linear model of @xcite , suitable for min - sum ( ms ) decoding , is refined to meet the behavior of belief propagation decoders . under some hypotheses ,",
    "the error probability level can be computed assuming an unsaturated ldpc decoder .",
    "loosely speaking , in this model an as is solved if messages coming from the rest of the graph tend to infinity with a rate higher than the wrong messages inside the as . in practical implementations , messages can not get arbitrarily large .",

    "in @xcite density evolution ( de ) is used , but this is accurate only for ldpc codes with infinite ( in practice , very large ) block lengths . in @xcite",
    "the saturation is taken into account and the input growth rate is evaluated via discretized de or empirically via simulation .    in @xcite and",
    "successive works , the authors rate the trapping set dangerousness with the _ critical number _ , that is valid for hard decoders but fails to discriminate between the soft entries of the iterative decoder .    in this paper",
    ", we look for a concise , quantitative way to rate the ass dangerousness with soft decoding .",
    "we focus on min - sum ( ms ) soft decoding that is the basis for any ldpc decoder implementation , leaving aside more theoretical algorithms such as sum - product ( spa ) or linear programming ( lp ) .",
    "we study the evolution of the messages propagating inside the as , when the all - zero codeword is transmitted . unlike @xcite , we assume a limited dynamic of the log likelihood ratios ( llrs ) as in a practical decoder implementation . the as dangerousness can be characterized by a _ threshold _",
    "we show that , under certain hypotheses , the decoder convergence towards the right codeword can fail only if there exist channel llrs smaller than or equal to @xmath0 . when all channel llrs are larger than @xmath0 , successful decoding is assured .",

    "if _ all _ messages in @xmath249 were saturated , we could achieve the maximum @xmath206 not respecting , obtaining @xmath250 .",
    "we now prove that this can not happen .",

    "we conclude that @xmath257 and that substituting @xmath258 with @xmath259 does not harm the threshold computation .    once again , we do not distinguish any more between @xmath57 , @xmath96 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 since they match , and simply use @xmath0 .    in principle",
