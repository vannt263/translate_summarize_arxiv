    "there are only 263 stable nuclei ; they are surrounded by radioactive ones . some of the unstable nuclei are long - lived and can be found on earth , some are man - made ( actually , as many as @xmath12,200 nuclei have been produced in nuclear laboratories ) , and several thousand nuclei are the yet - unexplored exotic species .",
    "the decay characteristics of most radioactive nuclei are determined by the beta decay , i.e. , by weak interactions . for heavier nuclei , where the electromagnetic interaction plays a more important role , other decay channels , such as emission of alpha particles or spontaneous fission ,",
    "dominate . moving away from stable nuclei by adding either protons or neutrons , one finally reaches the particle drip lines .",
    "the nuclei beyond the drip lines are unbound to nucleon emission ; that is , for those systems the strong interaction is unable to bind @xmath2 nucleons as one nucleus .",
    "so , the territory of exotic nuclei is enormous .",
    "the uncharted regions of the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) plane contain information that can answer many questions of fundamental importance for science : how many protons and neutrons can be clustered together by the strong interaction to form a bound nucleus ?",
    "what are the proton and neutron magic numbers of the exotic nuclei ?",
    "what are the properties of very short - lived exotic nuclei with extreme neutron - to - proton ratio @xmath0 ? what is the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction in the nucleus having a very large neutron excess ?",
    "there are also related questions in the field of nuclear astrophysics . since radioactive nuclei",
    "are produced in many astrophysical sites , knowledge of their properties is crucial to the understanding of the underlying processes .",
    "nuclear life far from stability is different from that around the stability line ; the promised access to completely new combinations of proton and neutron numbers offers prospects for new structural phenomena .",
    "the unique structural factor is the weak binding ; hence closeness to the particle continuum .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to discuss some of the theoretical challenges and opportunities of research with exotic nuclear beams .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ theory ] contains a brief review of theoretical developments related to the physics of exotic nuclei .",
    "sections  [ largenz ] and [ smallnz ] contain some of the physics issues of the neutron and proton drip lines , respectively , including a discussion on the theoretical uncertainties in determining the particle drip lines .",
    "finally , conclusions are contained in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "from a theoretical point of view , spectroscopy of exotic nuclei offers a unique test of those components of effective interactions that depend on the isospin degrees of freedom . in principle , the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction in heavy nuclei should be obtained by means of the brckner renormalization which corrects the free interaction for the effects due to the nuclear medium . in practice , however , the effective interaction is approximated by means of some phenomenological density - dependent force with parameters that are usually fitted to stable nuclei and to selected properties of the infinite nuclear matter .",
    "hence , it is by no means obvious that the isotopic trends far from stability predicted by commonly used effective interactions are correct . in the models aiming at such an extrapolation ,",
    "the important questions asked are : what is the density dependence of the two - body central force @xcite ?",
    "what is the density and radial dependence of the one - body spin - orbit force @xcite ? does the spin - orbit splitting strongly vary with @xmath0 @xcite ? what is the form of the pairing interaction in weakly bound nuclei @xcite ?",
    "what is the importance of the effective mass ( i.e. , the non - locality of the force ) for isotopic trends @xcite ?",
    "what is the role of the medium effects ( renormalization ) and of the core polarization in the nuclear exterior ( halo or skin region ) where the nucleonic density is small @xcite ?",
    "similar questions are asked in connection with properties of nuclear matter @xcite , neutron droplets @xcite , and the physics of the neutron - star crust @xcite .",
    "the radioactive nuclear beams experimentation is expected to expand the range of nuclei known .",
    "that is , by going to nuclei with extreme @xmath0 ratios , one can magnify the isospin - dependent terms of the effective interaction ( which are small in  normal \" nuclei ) .",
    "the hope is that after probing these terms at the limits of extreme isospin , we can later go back to the valley of stability and improve the description of  normal \" nuclei .",
    "but this task is not going to be easy .",
    "in many respects , weakly bound nuclei are much more difficult to treat theoretically than well - bound systems .",
    "hence , before tackling the problem of force parametrization at the extremes , one should be sure that the applied theoretical tools of the nuclear many - body problem are appropriate .",
    "as mentioned above , the main theoretical challenge is the correct treatment of the particle continuum . for weakly bound nuclei",
    ", the fermi energy lies very close to zero , and the decay channels must be taken into account explicitly . as a result , many cherished approaches of nuclear theory such as the conventional shell model , the pairing theory , or the macroscopic - microscopic approach must be modified .",
    "but there is also a splendid opportunity : the explicit coupling between bound states and continuum , and the presence of low - lying scattering states invite strong interplay and cross - fertilization between nuclear structure and reaction theory .",
    "many methods developed by reaction theory can now be applied to structure aspects of loosely bound systems .    how to extend traditional tools of nuclear theory to account for the scattering of nucleons from bound single - particle orbitals to unbound states ?",
    "the closeness of particle continuum reverberates in two aspects of the theoretical description .",
    "firstly , the particles forming a bound nuclear state can effortlessly _ virtually _ scatter back and forth into the particle continuum phase space .",
    "this process must conserve the compactness of the nuclear wave function which remains bound even with such a virtual scattering taken into account .",
    "a theoretical description of this kind of effects still remains a virgin territory , although some progress has been made in the analysis of the virtual pair scattering @xcite .",
    "secondly , nucleons can very easily leave the nucleus altogether and enter the particle continuum through the _ real _ scattering .",
    "for this , it is enough to slightly shake the nucleus by providing it with a little bit of energy .",
    "this is an old problem which , in the context of excited states near or above the particle threshold , has been addressed by the continuum shell model ( csm ) @xcite . in the csm ,",
    "the continuum states ( decay channels ) and bound states are treated on equal footing .",
    "consequently , correlations due to the coupling to resonances , the spatial extension effects in weakly bound states , the structure of resonances , and the structure of particle transfer form factors are properly described by the csm .",
    "so far , most applications of the csm have been concerned with the situation when there is only one particle occupying the shell - model continuum .",
    "this is because the continuum - continuum coupling is difficult to treat @xcite .",
    "often , particle continuum is approximated by the _",
    "quasibound states _ , i.e. , the states resulting from the diagonalization of a finite potential in a large basis @xcite or by enclosing the finite nuclear potential within an infinite well with walls positioned at a large distance from the nuclear surface @xcite . more sophisticated methods of discretizing continuum include the sturmian function expansions and resonant state expansions .",
    "sturmian functions , also known as weinberg states , form a discrete set of states which behave asymptotically as outgoing waves .",
    "they have been used as a basis in the solution of scattering equations , including various applications of the csm @xcite .",
    "the gamow states are eigenstates of the time - independent schrdinger equation with complex eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "they have been applied to many problems involving an unbound spectrum @xcite .    in the description of weakly bound systems , pairing interaction plays a unique role ( see section [ pairing ] below ) . in the bcs or bcs - like methods based on bound and quasibound states ( for examples of such calculations",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",

    ", we decompose the bcs wave function into contributions from bound states ( @xmath5 ) and quasibound states ( @xmath6 ) : @xmath7 , this problem is overcome in the hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) method with a realistic pairing interaction in which the coupling of bound states to the particle continuum is correctly taken into account @xcite .    15.cm    to illustrate this point , critical in the context of calculations for drip - line nuclei , fig .",
    "[ nickel ] displays theoretical two - neutron separation energies , @xmath8 , and the rms neutron radii for the even - even nickel isotopes obtained in the hfb and hf+bcs calculations . in the hf+bcs variant ,",
    "the self - consistent pairing gaps obtained from the hfb calculations were used within the fixed - gap approximation . as seen in fig .",
    "[ nickel ] , the values of @xmath8 obtained in the hfb and hf+bcs calculations agree very well ; some deviations are seen only for the neutron drip - line systems with @xmath3@xmath960 , where the hf+bcs values are slightly lower .",
    "however , this excellent agreement does not extend to neutron radii . in the hfb calculations",
    "the neutron radii behave very smoothly as a function of @xmath3 . on the other hand , in the hf+bcs model",
    "there is a dramatic increase in the neutron radii between magic numbers and for the neutron - rich nuclei resulting from the unphysical occupation of positive - energy quasibound states .",
    "the difference between values of radii obtained within the hfb and hf+bcs calculations can be as large as 0.8fm and increases dramatically for weakly bound systems .",
    "other examples illustrating the unphysical effect of the particle gas can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consequently , for large exotic nuclei , the self - consistent hfb treatment is not a matter of choice , it is a must .",
    "the calculations are not easy , especially if the self - consistent symmetries ( e.g. , spherical symmetry ) are broken .",
    "possible strategies for solving the hfb equations include the two - step diagonalization @xcite , the gradient method in the canonical representation @xcite , or the state - dependent hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "some examples of hfb calculations are discussed in the following sections .",
    "other calculations with self - consistent inclusion of pairing and continuum states include : quasiclassical lagrangian method calculations in the coordinate representation @xcite and application of the relativistic hartree - bogolyubov theory in coordinate space to light nuclei @xcite .    in order to describe excited states",
    ", one has to go beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "one method , often used in the description of low - lying collective states in drip - line nuclei , is the continuum random phase approximation ( crpa ) based on the single - particle green function approach in the coordinate representation @xcite .",
    "in particular , the crpa has been employed extensively to the very low - energy multipole strength in drip - line nuclei @xcite . however ,",
    "for meaningful predictions of excited states in weakly bound nuclei where pairing is expected to be very important , it is necessary to use the quasiparticle rpa scheme based on the coordinate space hfb formalism .",
    "calculations along these lines can be found in recent refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the following sections contain a brief description of selected highlights of the physics of radioactive nuclear beams .",
    "it is to be noted that there are many other important topics that have been left out in our discussion ( e.g. , physics of very light drip - line nuclei , physics of beta decay , reaction aspects involving radioactive ions ) .",
    "a key point is that the variety of exciting new phenomena is one of the driving forces behind research with exotic beams .",
    "since neutrons do not carry an electric charge and do not repel each other , many neutrons can be added to nuclei starting from the valley of stability . as a result ,",
    "the `` lever arm '' separating the neutron drip line from the valley of stability is large and difficult to probe experimentally ; except for the lightest nuclei , the bounds of the neutron stability are not known .",
    "but it is just for the nuclei with the extreme neutron excess that theory predicts many new and initially unexpected phenomena .",
    "in addition to nuclear structure interest , the neutron - rich environment is important for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "neutron - rich nuclei are characterized by spatially extended density distributions which give rise to large nuclear radial moments .",
    "extreme cases are halo nuclei  loosely bound few - body systems with about thrice more neutrons than protons .",
    "the halo region is a zone of weak binding in which quantum effects play a critical role in distributing nuclear density in regions not classically allowed .    in the heavier , neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "where the concept of mean field is better applicable , the separation into a  core \" and  valence nucleons \" seems less justified .",
    "however , also in these nuclei the weak neutron binding implies the existence of the neutron skin ( i.e. , a dramatic excess of neutrons at large distances ) .",
    "15.cm    figure  [ dens ] displays the neutron hfb densities for several tin isotopes across the stability valley , calculated with the effective interactions skp@xcite , siii@xmath10 @xcite , and d1s @xcite .",
    "the densities obtained with these forces are qualitatively very similar .",
    "one can see that adding neutrons results in a simultaneous increase of the central neutron density , and of the density in the surface region .",
    "the relative magnitude of the two effects is governed by a balance between the volume and the surface asymmetry energies of effective interactions .",
    "since all three forces considered have been fitted in a similar way to bulk nuclear properties ( including the isospin dependence ) , the resulting balance between the volume and the surface isospin effects is similar .",
    "of course , this does not exclude some differences which are seen when a more detailed comparison is carried out . as will be seen in sec  [ pairing ] below",
    ", pair densities depend much stronger on the effective forces .",
    "15.cm    a very interesting aspect of nuclei far from stability is an increase in their radial dimension with decreasing particle separation energy @xcite .",
    "this effect is especially strong in weakly bound nuclei close to the neutron drip line .",
    "figure  [ rexpt ] presents the comparison of experimental ( symbols ) and calculated proton and neutron rms radii for the semi - magic isotopes and isotones with @xmath4(or @xmath3)=20 , 28 , 50 , and 82 . for neutron radii in general , and for proton radii in light and medium - mass nuclei , the hfb+skp and hfb+siii@xmath11 models yield very similar predictions . in heavy nuclei ( @xmath4 or @xmath3=50 , 82 ) the proton radii in skp",

    "[ rexpt ] , the neutron skin is manifested by a rapid increase in neutron rms radii when approaching the two - neutron drip line .",
    "this effect is very localized in neutron number ; it appears only in a few nuclei in the immediate neighborhood of the neutron drip line .",
    "pairing correlations play a very special role in drip - line nuclei @xcite .",

    "@xmath15 is very small and @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , the single - particle field characterized by @xmath12 and the pairing field @xmath13 are equally important . in other words , contrary to the situation encountered close to the line of beta stability , the pairing component of the hamiltonian can no longer be treated as a residual interaction , i.e. , a small perturbation important only in the neighborhood of the fermi surface .",
    "surprisingly , very little is known about the pairing channel of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction . in most calculations ,",
    "the pairing hamiltonian has been approximated by the state - independent seniority pairing force , or schematic multipole pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "such oversimplified forces , usually treated by means of the bcs approximation , perform remarkably well when applied to nuclei in the neighborhood of the stability valley ( where , as pointed out above , pairing can be considered as a small correction ) . as a result ,",

    "@xcite for definitions and discussion . ] the pairing densities shown in fig .",
    "[ densitieshfb ] nicely reflect different characters of the interactions used .",
    "namely , the contact force skp@xmath10 leads to pairing densities that are , in general , largest at the origin and decrease towards the surface ; this is characteristic of the volume - type pairing correlations .",
    "a different pattern appears for the skp results , where the density dependence renders the pairing interaction strongly peaked at the surface . in this case , the pairing densities tend to increase when going from the center of the nucleus towards its surface .",
    "a more pronounced dependence on the neutron excess is seen here in the surface region . near the drip line",
    ", the pairing density develops a long tail extending towards large distances .",
    "the results obtained for the finite - range gogny interaction exhibit features intermediate between surface and volume - type pairing correlations .    15.cm    an experimental observable that may probe the character of the pairing field is the pair transfer form factor , directly related to the pairing density @xmath20 .",
    "the difference in the asymptotic behavior of single - particle density @xmath21 and pair density @xmath20 in a weakly bound system can be probed by comparing the energy dependence of one - particle and pair - transfer cross sections .",
    "such measurements , when performed for both stable and neutron - rich nuclei , can shed some light on the asymptotic properties of the pair densities ; hence on the character of the pairing field .",
    "figure  [ transfer ] displays the pair transfer form factors @xmath22 calculated in @xmath23sn , @xmath24sn , and @xmath25sn with the skp interaction .",
    "these pair transfer form factors clearly show that this process has a predominantly surface character . in particular",
    ", there is a significant increase in the pair transfer form factors in the outer regions of drip - line nuclei . in @xmath23sn ,",
    "the form factors vanish around 9fm , while in @xmath24sn and @xmath25sn they extend to much larger distances .",
    "the structure of nuclei is expected to change significantly as the limit of nuclear stability is approached in neutron excess . due to the systematic variation in the spatial distribution of nucleonic densities and the increased importance of the pairing field ,",
    "the average nucleonic potential is modified when approaching the neutron drip line .",
    "the main effect is the increase of the potential diffuseness ; the single - particle neutron potential in drip - line nuclei becomes very shallow , and the resulting shell - model spectrum resembles that of a harmonic oscillator with a spin - orbit term and with a weakened @xmath26 term @xcite .",
    "this results in a new shell structure characterized by a more uniform distribution of normal - parity orbits and the unique - parity intruder orbit which reverts towards its parent shell .",
    "10.cm    the effect of the weakening of shell effects in drip - line nuclei , first mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , was further investigated in refs .",
    "quenching of shell effects manifests itself in the behavior of two - neutron separation energies @xmath8 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "the large @xmath3=82 magic gap , clearly seen in the nuclei close to the stability valley and to the proton drip line , gradually closes down when approaching the neutron drip line .",
    "this result is independent of the size of the @xmath3=82 shell gap in stable nuclei , which is slightly underestimated and overestimated by skp and sly4 forces , respectively , as compared to experimental data .",
    "it can be attributed to two effects : ( i ) a gradual increase of the neutron surface diffuseness across the stability valley related to an increase of the neutron excess , and ( ii ) the influence of the continuum , which results in closing the shell gap near the neutron drip line down to zero .",
    "11.cm    predicted behaviour of the two - neutron separation energies depends very much on the effective interaction used .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sndrip ] which shows the @xmath8 values calculated in tin isotopes for the gogny interaction d1s and for four variants of the skyrme interaction .",
    "the gogny force and the skp and sly4@xmath10 skyrme forces predict a gradual decrease of the two - neutron separation energies while the older skyrme forces , siii@xmath10 and skm@xmath10 , give almost constant values followed by a sudden drop at @xmath3=126 .",
    "this shows that the @xmath3=126 shell quenching is not a generic effect .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ sndrip ] , the position of the neutron drip line for the sn isotopes also depends on the effective interaction used ; it varies between @xmath3=118 ( d1s ) and @xmath3=126 ( siii@xmath27 ) .",
    "hence , even if the theoretical method used to calculate nuclear masses is reliable near the drip line ( this is not the case for the commonly used macroscopic - microscopic models , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the uncertainty due to the largely unknown isospin dependence of the force gives an appreciable theoretical  error bar \" .",
    "10.cm    unfortunately , the results presented in fig .  [ sndrip ]",
    "do not tell us much about which of the forces discussed should be the ",
    "preferred one \" since we are dealing with dramatic extrapolations far beyond the region known experimentally .",
    "the comparison with the data can be carried out for nuclei closer to stability , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent quantitative analysis . a comparison with the experimental two - neutron separation energies is displayed in fig .  [ s2n ] .",
    "as seen , the agreement with data is unsatisfactory for siii@xmath10 . in particular , the shell - gap sizes at @xmath3=50 , 82 , and 126",
    "are strongly overestimated , and the values and the slopes of @xmath8 are , in most cases , incorrect . for the skm@xmath10 force one obtains similar deficiencies @xcite .",
    "the results shown in figs .  [ sndrip ] and [ s2n ] illustrate a very strong dependence of the two - neutron separation energies on the force parameters .",
    "although older forces , such as siii and skm * , can perform well in certain regions of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , they do not give a satisfactory global reproduction of the data .",
    "on the other hand , a fairly good global agreement obtained with the skp and sly4@xmath10 suggests that the improvement is possible , while a still better parametrization would be welcome .",
    "of course , forces which fail in reproducing the behavior with ( @xmath28 ) in known nuclei have little chance to perform better when going far from stability .",
    "for example , the predicted values of @xmath8 obtained for the siii@xmath10 and skm@xmath10 interactions ( fig .  [ sndrip ] ) followed by a strong shell effect at @xmath3=126 do not seem very reliable . a detailed analysis of the force - dependence of results may give us valuable information on the relative importance of various force parameters .    the gradual change in shell structure",
    "is expected to give rise to new sorts of collective phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is also to be noted that the experimentally observed collapse of magic gaps seen in some neutron - rich light nuclei is conventionally explained in terms of the shape transition to the deformed intruder configuration .",
    "here , spectacular examples are @xmath29mg@xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31s@xmath32 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "hf calculations predict the shape transition @xcite due to the crossing of spherical configuration by intruder states .",
    "such a lowering of the intruder configuration depends on the detailed balance between three components in the total energy : ( i ) the position of the intruder state at the spherical shape , ( ii ) the deformation energy gain associated with the deformation - driving orbital , and ( iii ) the symmetry - restoring force exerted by particles in the magic - shell configuration .",
    "the first and the third of these elements directly depend on the spherical shell structure and thus can be affected by the hypothetical shell quenching mechanism . however , the appearance of a coexisting configuration can not , of course , be discussed solely in terms of the spherical shell structure , and it still remains an open and exciting problem .",
    "16.cm    in the following section we discuss another important aspect of the shell quenching , namely , its consequences for the r - process and the stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "the very neutron - rich drip - line nuclei can not be reached experimentally under present laboratory conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "these systems are the building blocks of the astrophysical r - process ; their separation energies , decay rates , and neutron capture cross sections are the basic quantities determining the results of nuclear reaction network calculations .",
    "consequently , one hopes to learn about properties of very neutron - rich systems by studying the r - process component of the solar - system abundances of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "the recent r - process network calculations @xcite , based on several mass formulae , indicate that a quenching of the shell effect at @xmath3=82 is required in order to fill the @xmath2=120 and 140 r - abundance troughs , in accordance with the results of the hfb+skp model shown in fig .",
    "[ gap82 ] .",
    "in addition to nuclear structure , there are other factors which can influence the r - process abundances , for instance the astrophysical conditions of temperature , neutron density , and the process time scale @xcite .",

    "in addition to nuclear masses , another important piece of nuclear structure that determines the path of the r - process is the gt strength .",
    "it is usually calculated in the quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa ) theory @xcite .",

    "the properties of the deformed single - particle states , especially in the subthreshold region , were analyzed by making the multipole decomposition in the spherical partial waves with well - defined orbital angular momentum .",
    "it has been concluded that in the limit of very weak binding , the geometric interpretation of shape deformation is lost .",
    "that is , the deformation of the halo is solely determined by the spatial structure of the valence state wave function , independently of the shape of the core .",
    "the deformed core merely establishes the quantization axis of the system  important for determining the angular momentum projection on the symmetry axis , @xmath39 .",

    "namely , it is consistent with a superdeformed shape ( @xmath49= , @xmath39=0 halo ) , a spherical shape ( @xmath49=+ , @xmath39=0 halo ) , or an oblate shape ( @xmath49= , @xmath39=1 halo ) , regardless of the deformation of the core . in the language of the self - consistent mean - field theory , this result reflects the extreme softness of the system to the quadrupole distortion .",
    "shape deformation is an extremely powerful concept provided that the nuclear surface can be properly defined .",
    "however , for very diffused and spatially extended systems , the geometric interpretation of multipole moments and deformations is lost .",
    "the presence of the spatially extended neutron halo gives rise to the low - energy isovector modes .",
    "the deformation decoupling of the halo implies that the nuclei close to the neutron drip line are excellent candidates for isovector quadrupole deformations , with different quadrupole deformations for protons and neutrons .",
    "an example of such a situation has been predicted in the self - consistent calculations for the neutron - rich sulfur isotopes performed using the skyrme hf and relativistic mean - field methods @xcite .",
    "when approaching the neutron drip line , the calculated values of quadrupole deformation for neutrons are systematically smaller than those of the proton distribution .",
    "another promising candidate for such effects is the @xmath23sr nucleus which is presently being studied by the gcm configuration mixing of the skyrme hf states @xcite .",
    "the discussion of deformation in halo nuclei applies to systems with very small binding energy and with negligible pairing .",
    "how will this scenario be modified in the presence of pairing , and for greater separation energies ?",
    "we do not know the answer to this question at present ; the systematic investigation of the interplay between deformation and pairing in weakly bound neutron - rich nuclei is one of the most exciting avenues of rnb physics .",
    "on the proton - rich side of the valley of stability , physics is different than in nuclei with a large neutron excess . because of the coulomb barrier which tends to localize the proton density in the nuclear interior , nuclei beyond the proton drip line are quasibound with respect to proton emission .",
    "however , in spite of the stabilizing effect of the coulomb barrier , the effects associated with the weak binding are also present in proton drip - line nuclei .",
    "they are not as dramatic as on the other side of the stability valley , but nevertheless important .",
    "for instance , the thomas - ehrman shift @xcite , which is due to changes in the coulomb energy of the weakly bound proton , can lead to a decrease in the energy differences between analog states by a few hundred kev .",
    "this effect is most significant for loosely bound states and for orbitals having low angular momentum @xcite .",
    "( for the self - consistent calculations of the thomas - ehrman shift in the doubly - magic diproton emitter @xmath50ni , see ref .  @xcite . )",
    "consequently , indiscriminate applications of the nuclear shell - model to nuclei close to and beyond the proton drip line , ignoring the systematic changes in single - particle energies and wave functions due to weak binding , should probably be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "the doubly magic @xmath3=@xmath4=50 nucleus @xmath51sn is a paradigm of rnb physics at the proton - rich side .",
    "although it was found experimentally three years ago @xcite , it took more than two years to roughly determine its mass @xcite , and it will probably take quite a few years to find its first excited state . actually , the question what is this state constitutes an unresolved problem which is a challenge for theoretical predictions .",
    "a unique aspect of proton - rich nuclei with @xmath3=@xmath4 is that neutrons and protons occupy the same shell - model orbitals .",
    "consequently , due to the large spatial overlaps between neutron and proton single - particle wave functions , the proton - rich @xmath3=@xmath4 nuclei are expected to exhibit unique manifestations of proton - neutron ( pn ) pairing @xcite .    at present , it is not clear what the specific experimental fingerprints of the pn pairing are , whether the pn correlations are strong enough to form a static pair condensate , and what are their main building blocks @xcite .",
    "most of our knowledge about nuclear pairing comes from nuclei with a sizable neutron excess where the isospin @xmath52=1 neutron - neutron and proton - proton pairing dominate .",
    "now , for the first time , there is an experimental opportunity to explore nuclear systems in the vicinity of the @xmath3=@xmath4 line which have _ many _ valence @xmath53 pairs ; that is , to probe the interplay between the like - particle and pn ( @xmath52=0,1 ) pairing channels .",
    "this novel situation calls for the generalization of established theoretical models of nuclear pairing . in spite of several early attempts to extend the independent quasi - particle formalism to incorporate the effect of pn correlations in light nuclei ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an early review ) , no symmetry - unrestricted calculations for np pairing , based on the isospin - projected quasi - particle theory , have been carried out .",
    "so far , the strongest evidence for enhanced pn correlations around the @xmath3=@xmath4 line comes from the measured binding energies .",
    "an additional binding ( the so - called wigner energy ) found in these nuclei manifests itself as a spike in the isobaric mass parabola as a function of @xmath54=@xmath55 ( see the review @xcite and refs .",
    "quoted therein ) .",
    "the pn correlations are also expected to play a role in beta decay @xcite , deuteron transfer reactions @xcite , structure of high spins @xcite , and also in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the role of the @xmath52=0 part of the interaction on the presence of binding - energy irregularities near the @xmath3=@xmath4 has been recognized in ref .",
    "recent calculations  @xcite have revealed the rather complex mechanism responsible for the nuclear binding around the @xmath3=@xmath4 line . in particular , it has been found that the wigner term can not be solely explained in terms of correlations between the proton - neutron @xmath56=1 , @xmath52=0 ( deuteron - like ) pairs ( see fig .",
    "[ wigner ] ) .",
    "( for more discussion of this point , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "recently , the isospin structure of the density matrices and self - consistent mean fields has been discussed @xcite in the hfb theory allowing for a consistent microscopic description of pairing correlations in all isospin channels . theoretically , the pn pairing correlations have been studied by several authors in the hfb framework @xcite . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite this has been done in the coordinate space allowing for the classification of generic proton - neutron mixing mean fields .",
    "the resulting hfb equations have interesting properties . for spherical nuclei ,",
    "only the @xmath52=1 and @xmath56=0 nucleonic pairs are allowed .",
    "( the presence of the @xmath52=0 and @xmath56@xmath570 pairs would necessarily lead to deformed mean fields . ) consequently , for the spherical symmetry , two cases can be considered .",
    "the first one corresponds to pn pairs coupled to @xmath15=0 and is similar to the standard like - particle pairing .",
    "the second one , analogous to triplet pairing with @xmath58 , is more interesting because of breaking of the intrinsic parity .",
    "here , the hfb solution contains mixtures of proton and neutron states with different parities but with the same value of @xmath59 , e.g. , a mixing of the @xmath60 and @xmath61 orbitals .",
    "15.cm      nuclei beyond the proton drip line are ground - state proton emitters .",
    "initially , the parent nucleus is in a quasistationary state , and the proton emission may be considered as a process where the proton tunnels through the potential barrier . in most cases ,",
    "the combined coulomb and centrifugal potentials give rise to barriers which are as large as @xmath115mev .",
    "consequently , the associated lifetimes , ranging from 10@xmath62sec to a few seconds , are sufficiently long to obtain a wealth of spectroscopic information .",
    "experimentally , a number of proton emitters have now been discovered in the mass regions @xmath2@xmath1110 , 150 , and 170 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "it is anticipated that new regions of proton - unstable nuclei will be explored in the near future using radioactive nuclear beams .",
    "the width of the proton resonance can be estimated through the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) @xcite . from the decay width",
    "one can obtain the half - life of the proton emission , @xmath63 .",
    "the proton resonances are extremely narrow , @xmath64mev , hence it is difficult to calculate their widths directly .",
    "( it is worth noting that in ref .",
    "@xcite an attempt was made to calculate the proton emission width by solving the schrdinger equation in the complex plane . )",
    "recently , half - lives of the spherical proton emitters have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the core - plus - proton approach assuming @xmath65 to be a sum of a simple nuclear optical woods - saxon potential and the coulomb potential .",
    "three different methods have been used : dwba , the modified two - potential approach of gurvitz @xcite , and the semi - classical approximation wkb .",
    "( because of its simplicity , the wkb approach has been widely used to study spherical proton emitters @xcite . )    after computing the barrier penetration factor , the experimental spectroscopic factors @xmath66 could be determined as ratios of calculated and measured half - lives @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the spectroscopic factor measures the fragmentation of a single - particle orbital @xmath67 . in the bcs theory ,",
    "it is given by @xmath68 , i.e. , the probability that the spherical orbital ( @xmath69 ) is empty in the daughter nucleus .",
    "15.cm    the correlation between experimental and theoretical spectroscopic factors obtained in the dwba calculations is shown in fig .",
    "[ sfact ] for odd-@xmath4 , even-@xmath3 ground - state proton emitters .",
    "the agreement between experiment and theory is good .",
    "for the two cases indicated by stars , @xmath70i and @xmath71cs , the experimental values fall well below theoretical predictions .",
    "this suggests a strong fragmentation of the single - particle strength and/or increased tunneling probability as compared to spherical predictions .",
    "indeed , both @xmath70i and @xmath71cs are predicted to be deformed , and the  anomalous \" proton half - life of @xmath70i has been reproduced by deformed calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in general , proton emission half - lives depend mainly on the proton separation energy and orbital angular momentum , but rather weakly on the details of intrinsic structure of proton emitters , e.g. , on the parameters of the proton potential at least at a qualitative level ( factors of 2 - 3 ) .",
    "the weak sensitivity of @xmath63 to the details of the optical proton potential has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of two - proton radioactivity .",
    "it has been shown that more than 94 - 99% of the wkb exponent comes from the region @xmath72@xmath9@xmath73 , which is almost solely determined by the combined coulomb and centrifugal potentials .",
    "this suggests that the lifetimes of deformed proton emitters will provide direct information on the angular momentum content of the associated nilsson state , and hence , indirectly on the nuclear shape .",
    "proton radioactivity is an excellent example of the elementary three - dimensional quantum - mechanical tunneling .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations of proton emitters ( or theoretically predicted ground - state di - proton emitters ) will open up a wealth of exciting physics associated with the residual interaction coupling between bound states and extremely narrow resonances in the region of very low density of single - particle levels .",
    "an experimental excursion into new territories of the chart of the nuclides will offer many excellent opportunities for traditional nuclear structure .",
    "this may include new regions of quadrupole and octupole deformation , new regions of shape isomers , including superdeformations , new combinations of magic or semi - magic closures , and many others . for a comprehensive review of these possibilities ,",

    "experiments with radioactive beams are going to be long and difficult , and many examples of nuclear exotica discussed in this paper ( especially those concerning very neutron - rich systems ) are clearly out of reach , even assuming most optimistic experimental scenarios .",
    "the hope is , however , that some of the effects associated with the loose binding will be seen as deviations from smooth systematic trends @xcite or will show up at higher excitation energies closer to the particle threshold , as in the example of the analog states @xcite .",
    "theoretically , we are bound to adopt the strategy of going to the extreme values of @xmath3/@xmath4 in order to identify the qualitatively new phenomena , and then back down to experimentally achievable regions to see whether these phenomena can actually be observed .",
