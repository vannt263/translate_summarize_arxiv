    "we recently obtained a new hamiltonian for a lattice which includes interactions with internal nuclear degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we started with a dirac model for electrons and for nucleons on equal footing , then allowed the nuclei to be described by a finite basis expansion , and finally developed an approximation appropriate for low nuclear velocity .",
    "our original motivation for this was to obtain a model capable of describing the mass shift associated with excited nuclear states in a configuration interaction calculation .",
    "however , the new model unexpectedly contains a new coupling term which provides for a direct interaction between lattice vibrations and nuclear transitions .    on the face of it",
    ", this new interaction term looks like it should allow for the strongly - coupled transitions that we have sought @xcite in connection with the generalized lossy spin - boson models @xcite that we proposed to account for some of the anomalies ( such as excess heat @xcite and collimated x - ray emission @xcite ) that have been reported in experiments in recent years .",
    "what is needed at this point is an explicit calculation for some nuclear system to see how it works , what states are coupled to , and how big the interaction is .    in general nuclear structure models",
    "are much more complicated than atomic structure models due to the more complicated strong force interaction",
    ". we would like to work with empirical strong force models derived from scattering experiments and few - body bound state binding energies . in recent years",
    "these models have achieved impressive results @xcite ; however , some of these strong force models involve a fair amount of work to implement .",
    "if we go back a few decades we can find simpler versions of strong force models that are easier to work with , and are sufficiently accurate to clarify the issues of interest here . in the computations that follow we will focus on the old hamada - johnston potential model @xcite . without question the simplest compound nucleus which should show the effects of interest is the deuteron , and so we will focus on this system in what follows .    in this formulation",
    "we have modeled the nucleons as elementary dirac particles .",
    "as nucleons are made up of strongly interacting quarks , we know that they are not elementary dirac particles .",
    "to do better in the case of coupling with the deuteron , we would require a description in terms of the six constituent quarks .",
    "we would expect from such a model a coupling matrix element likely somewhat different from what we calculated in this work .",
    "even so , it makes sense here to pursue this simpler deuteron model based on simple dirac nucleons as a step forward in the modeling process .",
    "in a recent paper we discussed the derivation of a finite basis approximation for a moving nucleus in the many - particle dirac model which leads to the new coupling that we are interested in .",
    "we begin with the ( relativistic ) finite basis model that we obtained .      in @xcite",
    "we developed finite basis eigenvalue relations in the form    @xmath2    where the off - diagonal matrix elements were written as    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is the relative coupling matrix element    @xmath5    we defined @xmath6 as    @xmath7    the notation for the two - body version of the problem is a bit different than what we used for the many - particle problem .",
    "it is useful to recast the relative matrix element as    @xmath8    the relative part of the off - diagonal matrix element corresponds to the rest frame interaction terms , which might come about from strong force interactions as in the development above for the nonrelativistic deuteron problem .",
    "what is new is the coupling with the center of mass momentum @xmath9 that appears in @xmath10 .",
    "we are interested in these new matrix elements .",
    "in @xcite we discussed the reduction of the new interaction matrix element to the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the results can be expressed as    @xmath11 @xmath12 ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}_j \\cdot c \\hat{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\pi$}}}_j ) \\bigg | \\phi_i \\bigg \\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath13 ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}_j \\cdot c \\hat{\\bf p } ) \\bigg | \\phi_i \\bigg \\rangle \\bigg ] \\ ] ]    as above , this is written for the many - particle problem , and we wish to recast it in terms of the two - body problem ; we may write    @xmath14 @xmath15 ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}_1 \\cdot c \\hat{\\bf p } ) \\bigg | \\phi_i \\bigg \\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath16 ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}_1 \\cdot c \\hat{\\bf p } ) \\bigg | \\phi_i \\bigg \\rangle \\bigg ] \\ ] ] @xmath17 ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}_2 \\cdot c \\hat{\\bf p } ) \\bigg | \\phi_i \\bigg \\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath18 ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}_2 \\cdot c \\hat{\\bf p } ) \\bigg | \\phi_i \\bigg \\rangle \\bigg ] \\ ] ]      it is possible to split up this new interaction term into a contribution that takes the nucleon masses to be equal , and a small correction term that depends on the difference between the nucleon masses . in what follows",
    "our focus will be on the larger equal mass terms , which is equivalent to making an equal mass approximation . in this case",

    "it is possible to develop a nonrelativistic approximation using    @xmath25    in this case , a finite basis model that includes center of mass dynamics to lowest order could be developed starting from a nonrelativistic hamiltonian of the form    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is an operator that returns the rest mass energy of the nuclear state , and where @xmath28 in the equal mass approximation is    @xmath29 @xmath30\\ ] ]",
    "we know from the literature that the deuteron at rest can be modeled using a triplet s and triplet d state , since the tensor interaction mixes the two .",
    "since the kinetic energy and potential terms preserve @xmath31 and @xmath32 , each of the triplet s states mixes with a triplet d state that has the same @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the new interaction term causes these states to mix with singlet p states . in general",
    ", the new term does not preserve @xmath32 , so that we would require a finite basis approximation that distinguishes the different sublevels .",
    "however , it is possible to focus on a special case of the new interaction which does preserve @xmath32 .",
    "this occurs if we restrict our attention to    @xmath34    we find in this case that mixing occurs for @xmath35 , but not for @xmath36 . in response , we might write    @xmath37    with the understanding that    @xmath38      nuclear state construction is usually carried out in the isospin scheme , with antisymmetry enforced through the application of the generalized pauli principle .",
    "the two - body problem is particularly simple in this regard , with spin , isospin and spatial components restricted to being either symmetric @xmath39 or antisymmetric @xmath40 ; we may write for the three states    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    the antisymmetric spin and isospin terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 are singlets , and the symmetric spin and isospin terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 are triplets .      the s state is a triplet spin state , so we may write it as    @xmath48 @xmath49    the @xmath50 are spherical harmonics ; we choose @xmath51 and @xmath52 since we are working with an s state .",

    "in addition , we have found that these off - diagonal matrix element depend on the nuclear spin , which suggests that the system may respond to net spin alignment .",
    "we recently proposed a new fundamental hamiltonian for condensed matter lattice problems that includes coupling to nuclear internal degrees of freedom . from our perspective",

    "that result is an estimate for the coupling matrix element .",
    "the development of an estimate for this matrix element is challenging for a variety of reasons .",
    "we have presumed in the derivation of the fundamental hamiltonian that it is sufficient to model the nucleons as elementary dirac particles .",
    "however , we know that nucleons are composite particles made up of quarks and gluons , and that it is unlikely that using a dirac model as we have done is going to give accurate results . to do better we probably need to go back and develop a better fundamental hamiltonian based on quarks and electrons . if it is possible to obtain reasonable nucleon models from empirical potentials , then we may be able to develop a better estimate for the deuteron coupling matrix element .",
    "working directly with bound state qcd at this stage does not seem to be an attractive option .",
    "once we have decided on the simpler model that adopts an elementary dirac particle model for nucleons , then it is an issue of whether to use a relativistic or nonrelativistic model , and further it is an issue of what potential to use .",
    "since these computations involve a fair amount of work , it seemed sensible to adopt a nonrelativistic model since it is simpler , and to work with an older relatively simple nuclear model .",
    "the hamada - johnston potential fits the bill in this regard , as it is sufficiently simple that we are able to complete a calculation in relatively short order .",
    "perhaps the most work in this computation was the evaluation of the spin , isospin , and angular momentum algebra ; for this we relied on brute force mathematica calculations .    in the end , we have developed a model for the coupling between the different nuclear spin states of the ground state deuteron and lattice - induced coupling to a highly - excited singlet p virtual state .",
    "the energy of this virtual state is about 125 mev in this model , which is consistent with our expectations .",
    "the coupling matrix element fell short of what we had hoped for by about an order of magnitude .",
    "we will need to clarify in future calculations if this is sufficiently large to be relevant to experimental results .",
    "the coupling matrix element in this model is proportional to @xmath32 , which is interesting in connection with the reported dependence of excess heat on the strength of an applied magnetic field .",
    "since the matrix element is proportional to @xmath32 , there is the potential for a larger coupling if the deuteron spins can be aligned .",
