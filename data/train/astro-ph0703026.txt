    "jovian trojan asteroids are found in two swarms around the l4 and l5 lagrangian points of the jupiter s orbit ( for a review see marzari et al .",
    "2001 ) . the first jovian trojan was discovered a century ago by max wolf .",
    "close to 2,000 jovian trojans were discovered by the end of 2003 ( bendjoya et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter b04 ) .",
    "about half are numbered asteroids with reliable orbits ( marzari et al .",
    "their total number is suspected to be similar to the number of the main belt asteroids ( shoemaker et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "trojans positions relative to jupiter librate around l4 ( leading swarm ) and l5 ( trailing swarm ) with periods of the order hundred years .",
    "their orbital eccentricity is typically smaller ( @xmath40.2 ) than those of main - belt asteroids , but the inclinations are comparable , with a few known trojans having inclinations larger than 30 degree .",
    "the largest objects have diameters exceeding 100 km .",
    "they typically have featureless ( d type ) spectra and extremely low optical albedo ( tedesco 1989 ; fernndez , sheppard & jewitt 2003 ) .",
    "these spectral properties are similar to those of cometary nuclei . however , there are also trojans that have p or common c - type classification , mostly found in the trailing swarm ( fitzsimmons et al .",
    "the collisional grinding of trojan asteroids is supported by their observed size distribution ( jewitt , trujillo & luu 2000 , hereafter jtl ) .",
    "numerous studies of the origin of jovian trojans are based on two different hypothesis . according to one of them ,",
    "the jovian trojans were formed simultaneously with jupiter in the early phase of the solar nebula .",
    "the growing jupiter could have captured and stabilized the plantesimals near its l4 and l5 points ( peale 1993 ) .",
    "the other hypothesis assumes that the majority of jovian trojans were captured over a much longer period , and were formed either close to jupiter , or were gravitationally scattered from the main belt or elsewhere in the solar system ( jewitt 1996 ) .",
    "the spectral comet - like appearance of many trojans is consistent with the scattering from the outer solar system .",
    "depending on the importance of gas drag when trojans formed , the l4 and l5 swarms could have different dynamics .",
    "the presence of significant gas drag helps stabilize orbits around the l5 point . on the other hand ,",
    "these trailing objects have later evolution different from the leading swarm because planetary migration destabilizes l5 ( gomes 1998 ) .",
    "morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) recently suggested a more complex picture : the present permanent trojan populations are built up by objects that were trapped after the 1:2 mean motion resonance crossing of the saturn and the jupiter .",
    "therefore , it is possible that size distributions , or detailed distributions of orbital parameters , could be different for the leading and trailing swarm .",
    "however , no such differences have yet been found ( marzari et al . , 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that there are severe observational biases in the sample of known jovian trojans due to their large distance .",
    "for example , although the numbers of main - belt asteroids and trojans to a given size limit are similar , only about 1% of the known objects belong to the latter group .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a trojan at a heliocentric distance of 5.2 au is about 4 magnitudes fainter than a same - size main - belt asteroid at a heliocentric distance of 2.5 au ( as observed in opposition , and not accounting for differences in albedo , which further diminishes the trojan s apparent magnitude ) .",
    "here we present an analysis of the properties of about 1000 known and candidate jovian trojan asteroids based on the data collected by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "sdss , although primarily designed for observations of extragalactic objects , is significantly contributing to studies of the solar system objects because asteroids in the imaging survey must be explicitly detected and measured to avoid contamination of the samples of extragalactic objects selected for spectroscopy .",
    "preliminary analysis of sdss commissioning data ( ivezi et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter i01 ) showed that sdss will increase the number of asteroids with accurate five - color photometry by more than two orders of magnitude , and to a limit about five magnitudes fainter ( seven magnitudes when the completeness limits are compared ) than previous multi - color surveys ( e.g. the eight color asteroid survey , zellner , tholen & tedesco 1985 ) .",
    "as we demonstrate below , the sdss data extend the faint completeness limit for trojan asteroids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( to a limiting diameter of @xmath5 km ) .",
    "the large sample and accurate astrometric and five - band photometric sdss data to a much fainter limit than reached by most previous surveys , together with suitable ways to quantify selection effects , allow us to address the following questions :    1 .",
    "what is the size distribution of jovian trojans asteroids with diameters larger than 10 km ? 2 .",
    "do the leading and trailing swarms have the same size distribution ( including both the distribution shape and the overall number above some size limit ) ? 3 .",
    "what is their color distribution in the sdss photometric system , and how does it compare to the color distribution of main - belt asteroids ? 4 .",
    "is the color distribution correlated with inclination , as suggested by a preliminary analysis of sdss data ( ivezi et al .",
    "2002a , hereafter i02a ) ? 5 .",
    "are the trojans size and color correlated ( as suggested by bendjoya et al .",
    "2004 ) ? 6 .",
    "do the leading and trailing swarms have the same color distribution ? 7 .   is the size distribution correlated with inclination ?",
    "the sdss asteroid data are described in section 2 , and in section 3 we describe a novel method for selecting candidate jovian trojan asteroids from sdss database .",

    "for example , jovian trojan asteroids are typically slower than main - belt asteroids because their distances from earth are larger ( the observed angular velocity is dominated by the earth s reflex motion ) . however , in addition to angular velocity , the selection algorithm must also include the longitudinal angle from the opposition , @xmath22 , because for large values of @xmath23 the main - belt asteroids can have angular velocity as small as jovian trojans .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in figure  [ knownkin ] .",
    "we optimize criteria for selecting candidate jovian trojans with the aid of 482 observations of 313 trojans from sdss moc that have known orbits extracted from astorb file ( there are 43,424 unique objects with known orbits in the third release of sdss moc ) .",
    "these 482 observations are identified in orbital space using constraints 5.0 au @xmath4 a @xmath4 5.4 au and e @xmath4 0.2 , and hereafter referred to as the known trojans ( kt ) . of those ,",
    "the majority ( 263 ) belong to the leading swarm .",
    "we compare the angular velocity and @xmath22 distributions of these objects to those for the whole sample in figure  [ knownkin ] .",
    "we find that the following selection criteria result in a good compromise between the selection completeness and contamination : @xmath24 for observations with @xmath25 .",
    "that is , only observations obtained relatively close to the opposition can be used to select a sample with a low contamination rate by main - belt asteroids .",
    "the adopted velocity limits are in good agreement with those proposed by jtl .    when applied to all objects from sdss moc , this selection results in a sample of 1187 candidate trojans , including 272 observations of known objects ( see figure  [ allkin ] ) . of the latter , 8 objects",
    "have semi - major axis too small to be a trojan asteroid , which implies a contamination rate of 3% .",
    "sdss moc contains 297 observations of known trojans obtained with @xmath26 , which implies that the kinematic selection method is 89% complete .",
    "the 264 detections of known trojans in the kinematically selected sample correspond to 191 unique objects . therefore , 1187 detections in the candidate sample correspond to about 858 unique objects .",
    "the contamination rate could be higher than 3% because objects with known orbits tend to be brighter and thus have smaller measurement uncertainties for angular velocities than objects from the full candidate sample ( for a detailed study of these errors and their correlation with other observables see i01 ) .",
    "for this reason , we perform the following robustness test .",
    "the above selection procedure does not include @xmath27 , the longitudinal angle between an object and jupiter .",
    "if the selection is robust , the @xmath27 distributions for the known and candidate trojans should be similar .",
    "as discernible from figure  [ lambdatest ] , this is indeed the case and demonstrates that the contamination rate by non - trojan asteroids in the candidate sample must be small .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached when comparing color distributions ( see below ) .",
    "we refer to this sample hereafter as the candidate trojans ( ct ) .     vs. @xmath27 diagram .",
    "although @xmath27 was not used in selection , the known and candidate trojans have similar @xmath27 distributions ( the third panel from top , dotted and solid histograms , respectively ) , and different than for the whole sample , dominated by main - belt asteroids ( dashed line ) . note that these @xmath27 distributions are not corrected for the selection biases due to inhomogeneous coverage of @xmath28 plane ( which are presumably similar for both known and candidate objects ) , and thus are not representative of the true distribution . the bottom panel compares the angular velocity distributions of trojans and main - belt asteroids.,width=302 ]",
    "using the sample of candidate trojan asteroids selected as described above , here we analyze their distribution in the 3-dimensional size - color - inclination space , both for the full sample and separately for each swarm .",
    "the large size of the selected candidate sample allows accurate measurements of this distribution , and represents an especially significant improvement over the previous work when studying color distribution .",
    "the two largest homogeneous studies of spectral properties of jovian trojans are by jewitt & luu ( 1990 ) and bendjoya et al .",
    "jewitt & luu obtained spectra of 32 trojans and found that they are remarkably similar to cometary spectra .",
    "bendjoya et al .",
    "obtained spectroscopic observations for 34 objects and , together with older observations , produced a sample of 73 objects .",
    "therefore , accurate color information for over a thousand objects discussed here represents a substantial improvement .",
    "it is usually assumed that the leading ( l4 ) and trailing ( l5 ) swarms contain similar number of asteroids down to the same size limit ( e.g. jtl ) .",
    "although the number of _ known _ objects in l4 and l5 differ ( e.g. as listed in bowell s astorb file ) , this asymmetry is usually dismissed as due to complex selection biases in the sample of trojans with known orbits ( e.g. marzari et al .",
    "2001 ) . on the other hand , pl & sli ( priv .",
    "find using numerical simulations that the perturbations by saturn produce different stability regions for l4 and l5 .",
    "this effect is suspected to cause about a factor of 2 population size difference between the leading and trailing swarms .",
    "therefore , it seems worthwhile to examine the number ratio for the two swarms implied by the sdss data .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ maps ] shows the observed surface density map of candidate trojan asteroids in jupiter s coordinate system .",
    "there are 1.9 times more objects with @xmath29 than with @xmath30 ( this asymmetry is already easily discernible in histograms shown in figure  [ lambdatest ] ) .",
    "however , this map does not reveal true density distribution because selection biases are strong even when using a homogeneous survey such as sdss .",
    "the most important selection effect is the varying number of sdss observations as a function of position relative to jupiter , as shown in the middle panel .",
    "it is the ratio of these two maps that is the best estimate of the underlying distribution of trojan asteroids .",
    "this map is shown in the bottom panel in figure  [ maps ] .",
    "it is still not straightforward to use the counts from this corrected map to assess the number - count ratio for the two swarms .",
    "the reason is that the sdss coverage of the @xmath28 plane is not symmetric with respect to @xmath31 , and thus the counts can not be simply summed up and compared . at the same time , the shape of the underlying distribution in the @xmath28 plane is not known .",
    "we use two different methods to solve this problem .",
    "the first one assumes that the _ shape _ of the true distribution of trojan asteroids in the @xmath28 plane is symmetric with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the second one estimates this shape using a sample of known trojans and normalizes it using the ct sample .",
    "although the coverage of the @xmath33 plane by the available observations is fairly sparse , there is sufficient overlap of regions with the same @xmath34 and @xmath35 to compute the number ratio for the two swarms . with the assumption of symmetry with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we determine that the leading - to - trailing number ratio is 1.8@xmath360.2 ( weighted average of all pixels ) .",
    "_ it appears that the leading swarm has almost twice as many objects as the trailing swarm .",
    "_    the accuracy of the number - count ratio estimate can be increased when the shape of the @xmath28 distribution is assumed to be known ( because all the data are used ) .",
    "we determined this shape using a sample of 1178 known trojan asteroids from astorb file .",
    "their distribution in the @xmath28 plane is shown in the top panel in figure  [ maps2 ] .",
    "we find that the shape of this distribution is well described by two two - dimensional gaussians centered on @xmath32 deg and @xmath37 deg , with the widths ( @xmath38 ) of 9 deg and 14 deg , for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively and indicate that the distribution of trojans on the sky is not circularly symmetric around l4 and l5 points , as assumed by jtl . ] .",
    "using this shape , we fit the overall normalization for each swarm separately ( i.e. two free parameters ) and obtain the leading - to - trailing number ratio of 1.6@xmath360.1 .",
    "the best - fit model is shown in figure  [ maps2 ] , as well as the residual map . with the assumption that the @xmath28 distribution does not depend on size ,",
    "this is our best estimate for the relative number count normalization for the two swarms .",
    "it is reassuring that we obtained a statistically consistent result using the first method .",
    "we emphasize that there is no discernible difference in the shape of the spatial distribution of objects from the two swarms .",
    "interestingly , this number ratio is about the same as the leading - to - trailing ratio of trojans with known orbits in bowell s astorb file .",
    "although the selection effects are typically invoked to explain this asymmetry , it instead appears to be a real effect ( we show below that the sample of known trojans is indeed fairly complete to @xmath41 ) . on the other hand , the number ratio of asteroids in the two swarms could be dependent on object s size , and the sdss sample extends to smaller sizes than astorb file .",

    "the above result implies that there are about 1 million jovian trojans larger than 1 km , to within a factor of 2 ( uncertainty comes from the error in @xmath54 and extrapolation over 5  mags ; in addition , this normalization scales with the albedo approximately as @xmath80 ) .",
    "this estimate could be up to a factor of 2 too high if trojans size distribution becomes shallower for objects smaller than @xmath35  km , as was found for main - belt asteroids ( see i01 ) , and is suggested for jovian trojans by yoshida & nakamura ( 2005 ) .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the normalization obtained by jtl and imply that _ there are about as many jovians trojans as there are main - belt asteroids down to the same size limit . _    in previous section , we demonstrated that l4 has a significantly larger number of objects than l5 . to examine",
    "whether , in addition to this difference in overall normalization , the _ slope _ of the size ( i.e. @xmath45 ) distribution is different for the two swarms , we separately analyzed their counts .",
    "the slope of the size distributions for both the candidate trojans ( figure  [ l4l5counts ] ) and for known trojans ( figure  [ l4l5countsallbowell ] ) are the same within measurement uncertainties ( with the slope error @xmath30.05 ) .",
    "note that the l4-to - l5 count ratios shown in the bottom panel in figures  [ l4l5counts ] and figure  [ l4l5countsallbowell ] are different from the value of 1.6 discussed in section  [ nl4vsl5 ] because @xmath81 selection effects ( which are not a function of size ) are not taken into account .",

    ".    we first correct color measurements for the phase effects using a linear color vs. phase angle approximation discussed in section  [ magdist ] .",
    "we obtained the following best - fit relations for the colors corrected to zero phase angle @xmath82 and @xmath83 with the coefficient errors of about 0.001 mag / deg .",
    "no significant correlation with the phase angle was detected for the @xmath84 color , and too few objects have accurate @xmath85 color measurement to attempt a robust fit . as the mean value of @xmath70 is about 2 degree , these corrections are small compared to photometric accuracy .",
    "the color distribution of trojan asteroids is compared to the color distribution of main - belt asteroids in figure  [ ccdfig ] .",
    "the mean colors and their standard deviation ( not the error of the mean ! ) for candidate trojans with color errors less than 0.05 mag are @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 ( for reference , these colors correspond to johnson s @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , using the photometric transformations from ivezi et al .",
    "2007 ; these values are in good agreement with previous work , e.g. , fornasier et al .",
    "2004 , dotto et al .",
    "the two distributions are different , with the difference maximized in the @xmath84 vs. @xmath93 diagram . using solar colors from i01 , we compute the relative albedo for trojan asteroids and compare it to the three dominant main - belt color types in figure  [ albedo ] .",
    "as expected from previous work , trojan asteroids are redder than main - belt asteroids at wavelengths longer than the visual band .",
    "in addition to maximizing color differences between trojan and main - belt asteroids , the @xmath84 vs. @xmath93 diagram is interesting because the distribution of candidate trojans suggests bimodality . to quantify this effect in the subsequent analysis",
    ", we define a color index which is a linear combination of the @xmath93 and @xmath84 colors : @xmath94 with the phase - angle correction @xmath95    the distribution of this color index for known and candidate trojans is compared to that of the main - belt asteroids in figure  [ tcolorhist ] .",
    "the fact that the distributions for known and candidate trojans are indistinguishable , while clearly different from that of the main - belt asteroids , is another demonstration of the robustness of kinematic selection method .",
    "the @xmath96 distribution for trojan asteroids is bimodal . at first",
    "it appears that this bimodality is related to l4 vs. l5 separation , as illustrated in figure  [ tcolorhist ] .",
    "however , objects from l4 and l5 have different _ observed _ orbital inclination distribution due to observational selection effects ( see section  [ colorinc ] ) .",
    "instead , the differences in the l4 and l5 color distributions are due to a color - inclination correlation , as detailed below .      [ cols=\">,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as was already discernible in figure  [ pp1 ] , the color and orbital inclination for jovian trojan asteroids are correlated .",
    "this correlation is presented in a more quantitative way in the top panel in figure  [ figinccolor ] and in table 1 . as evident , objects with large orbital inclination tend to be redder .",
    "for example , the median @xmath96 color is -0.01 for objects with inclination less than 10 degree , while it is 0.04 for objects with inclination greater than 10 degree , and 0.06 for those with inclination greater than 20 degree . while these differences are not large , they are detected at a statistically significant level ( the formal uncertainties are smaller than 0.01 mag ) .",
    "equivalently , the median inclination for objects with @xmath97 is 8.9 degree , while it is 13.4 for the redder objects .",
    "the marginal color distributions for subsamples selected by inclination are shown in the left panel in figure  [ figinccolorhist ] .",
    "the sample of candidate trojans is much larger and fainter than the sample of known trojans and can be used to test whether the color - inclination correlation extends to smaller sizes .",
    "since the orbital inclination is unknown for the majority of candidate trojans , we use as its proxy the latitude relative to jupiter s orbit , @xmath39 . when the sample of known trojans is separated by @xmath98 deg , 89% of high - inclination and 66% of low - inclination objects are correctly classified .",
    "as evident from the middle panel in figure  [ figinccolorhist ] , the differences in color histograms for subsamples of known trojans separated by @xmath39 are still discernible , which justifies the use of @xmath39 as a proxy for inclination .",
    "the color histograms for candidate trojans separated by @xmath39 are shown in the right panel in figure  [ figinccolorhist ] . as they look similar to the analogous histograms for known trojans , we conclude that the color - inclination correlation extends to smaller sizes .",
    "( latitude relative to jupiter s orbit ) .",
    "the bottom panel is analogous to the middle panel , except that it shows candidate trojans.,width=302 ]        due to observational selection effects , the l5 subsample of known trojans has a larger fraction of objects with large inclinations than the l4 subsample .",
    "this difference between l4 and l5 , together with the color - inclination correlation , results in differences between their @xmath96 color distributions discernible in figure  [ tcolorhist ] .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ figinccolorhistl4l5 ] , once the objects are separated by inclination , or by @xmath39 , this difference between l4 and l5 objects disappears .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for different color - inclination correlations between the two swarms .",
    "the similarity of the histograms shown in the middle and right panels in figure  [ figinccolorhist ] suggests that the color - inclination correlation can not be a strong function of object s size .",
    "another `` slice '' through the observed color - inclination - size - swarm space is shown in figure  [ sizecolorfig ] .",
    "we find no strong correlation between the trojan size and color , except for a few large l4 objects with high inclination that have about @xmath30.05 mag redder @xmath96 color . indeed",
    ", these few objects may be the reason for a claim by bendjoya et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the spectral slope ( i.e. color ) is correlated with size in the size range 70160 km .",
    "the kinematically - selected sample of candidate jovian trojan asteroids analyzed here is complete at the faint end to @xmath0 mag , approximately corresponding to 10 km diameter , with a contamination rate of only @xmath33% .",
    "similarity of the longitude ( relative to jupiter ) and color distributions between known and candidate trojans , and their difference from the distributions for main - belt asteroids which dominate the parent sample , strongly suggest that the kinematic selection is robust .",
    "the well - controlled selection effects , the sample size , depth and accurate five - band uv - ir photometry enabled several new findings and the placement of older results on a firmer statistical footing .",
    "the main results obtained here are :    1 .",
    "the differential size distribution of jovian trojan asteroids follows a power law , @xmath99 , with the power - law index of @xmath100 , in agreement with previous work ( e.g. jtl ) .",
    "this value of @xmath101 implies that the total mass is dominated by large objects .",
    "the overall normalization is tied to a complete sample of known trojans and suggests that there are about as many jovians trojans as there are main - belt asteroids down to the same size limit , also in agreement with earlier estimates .",
    "the same power - law size distribution provides a good description for both the leading ( l4 ) and trailing ( l5 ) swarm .",
    "their spatial distribution on the sky can be described by two elliptical gaussian distributions ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) that have _ different _ normalization : _ there are 1.6@xmath360.1 more objects in the leading than in the trailing swarm . _ the cumulative number of jovian trojan asteroids ( per deg@xmath6 ) as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath45 and a position in jupiter s coordinate system ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 , in degree ) can be estimated from @xmath106 where @xmath107 is given for @xmath108 by eq .",
    "[ ncum ] , and @xmath109 3 .",
    "the two orders of magnitude increase in the number of objects with accurate color measurements allowed us to demonstrate that trojan asteroids have a remarkably narrow color distribution ( root - mean - scatter of only @xmath30.05 mag ) that is significantly different from the color distribution of the main - belt asteroids .",
    "we find that the color of trojan asteroids is correlated with their orbital inclination , in a similar way for both swarms , but appears uncorrelated with the object s size .",
    "we did not detect a size - inclination correlation .",
    "these results have direct implications for the theories of trojans origin .",
    "the detected difference in the normalization between leading and trailing swarms suggests that there was at least some period during which their formation and/or evolution was different .",
    "similarly , the color - inclination correlation suggests that there must have been a process in the past which is responsible for the increased fraction of red objects at high orbital inclinations .",
    "gas dynamics and planetary migration are good candidates for such a process , as recently discussed by tsiganis et al .",
    "a possible explanation for this correlation is that when asteroids on the temporary eccentric orbits encounter the sun , their minimal distance from the sun is related to the inclination we observe today . in this picture",
    "the space weathering effects and volatization would vary with the inclination .",
    "a detailed analysis of these possibilities is beyond the scope of this paper and we leave it for future work .    while the increase in sample size enabled by sdss is considerable , very soon new large - scale sky surveys , such as pan - starrs ( kaiser et al .",
    "2002 ) and lsst ( tyson 2002 ) , may obtain even more impressive samples , both in size , diversity of measurements and their accuracy .",
    "for example , lsst will scan the whole observable sky every three nights in two bands to a @xmath110 depth equivalent to @xmath111 ( about 2.5 mag deeper than sdss ) . using the size distribution determined here",
    ", we estimate that lsst , which may have its first light in 2014 , will collect a sample of about 100,000 jovian trojan asteroids and provide _ both _ orbits , accurate color measurements and light curves for the majority of them . a significant fraction ( 2030% ) of this sample will be obtained by pan - starrs4 , which is supposed to have its first light around 2009 .",
    "these samples will undoubtely reinvigorate both observational and theoretical studies of jovian trojan asteroids .",
