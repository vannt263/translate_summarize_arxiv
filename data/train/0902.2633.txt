    "started out as research on vehicular traffic , _ traffic flow _",
    "has connected with a wide range of social problems such as traffic jam @xcite , evacuation in emergency @xcite , and biological systems @xcite .",
    "also , traffic flow is a good subject to apply mathematical developments for @xcite .",
    "highway - like traffic , intended in this paper , is modeled as a one - dimensional system in which a number of particles move in the same direction interacting one another .",
    "one may regard it as compressible fluid from the macroscopic viewpoint or as a many - body system of driven particles from the microscopic viewpoint .",
    "accordingly , there appear a lot of models @xcite ; some are coupled differential equations , and others are cellular automata ( ca ) .",
    "ca models are fully discrete , i.e. , not only independent variables but also dependent variables take integer values , and hence it is quite suitable for computer simulation .",
    "what makes traffic flow a distinct subject from traditional physics is that particles in traffic flow have an asymmetric interaction .",
    "each particle moves mainly under the influence of the particles in front but in contrast hardly does under that of the following ones .",
    "for this idea , in earlier works @xcite , _ the car - following models _ were introduced as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a function , @xmath2 is a constant and @xmath3 denotes the position of the @xmath4th particle at time @xmath5 ; accordingly , @xmath6 means the headway to the particle in front , i.e. @xmath7th one .",
    "it is remarkable that the car - following models introduce two fundamental ideas : one is _ time delay _ for the particle to respond to the change of traffic situation , and the other is a function which prescribes the _ optimal velocity _ for the distance .",
    "namely , eq . ( [ cfm ] ) means that each particle tends / intends to adjust its own velocity to the optimal velocity prescribed by @xmath1 , which requires a delay @xmath2 .",
    "it is noted that the car - following model has an exact solution if one chooses @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are constants determined empirically @xcite .",
    "another choice will be seen below . for the latter purpose",
    ", we refer to the function denoted by @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ cfm ] ) as _ the optimal velocity ( ov ) function_.    if @xmath2 is small enough to make the approximation @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ cfm ] ) , we have _ the optimal velocity ( ov ) model _ @xcite @xmath13,\\label{ov}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 means the sensitivity of the particle to traffic situation .",
    "the ov model successfully reproduces the linear instability of uniform flow in which every particle maintains the same distance from the particle in front .",
    "in particular , high - flux traffic appears as a uniform flow with middle headway .",
    "( note that the flux is defined by the product of density and velocity . )",
    "the stability of the ov model changes depending on both the sensitivity and the uniform headway , and there exists a critical line at which the uniform flow changes from unstable to stable .",
    "if one chooses @xmath15 then one finds the critical point @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 denoting the critical values of the sensitivity and the uniform distance , respectively ) at which the flux reaches its maximum value @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we refer to the ov model with eq .",
    "( [ tanh ] ) as the ov model , and the car - following model with eq .",
    "( [ tanh ] ) as _ the delay ov model_. it is remarkable that the delay ov model also has an exact solution expressed by an elliptic function @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", they show that , around the critical point mentioned above , the ov model reduces to _ the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath19 ( subscripts @xmath20 and @xmath21 denoting partial differentiations in them ) . actually , in the scaling limit : @xmath22 where the scaling parameter @xmath23 tends to zero , one obtains eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ ov ] ) as the lowest order approximation .",
    "the mkdv equation is one of well - known soliton equations , and it admits kink solutions @xcite .",
    "kink solutions show a shock wave with some plateaus , and it can describe a traffic jam propagating to the upper stream . in @xcite , they also claim that a kink solution is selected , independently of the initial condition , by the next - order correction and one therefore observes a kink solution at the critical point in numerical simulation .    _ soliton equations _",
    "possess quite rich mathematics such as a series of soliton solutions , hierarchy of equations and an infinite number of conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "a @xmath24-soliton solution contains @xmath24 solitary wave packets , i.e. solitons , each of which behaves like a particle .",
    "one can import this solitonic nature directly from soliton equations to ca by using _",
    "the ultra - discrete method _",
    "the ultra - discrete method is a nonanalytic limiting procedure to discretize the dependent variable of difference equations .",
    "the obtained cas with solitonic nature are called _ the soliton cellular automata _ ( sca ) or _ the box and ball systems _ ( bbs ) @xcite .",
    "it is , however , rather complicated to obtain a sca from a soliton equation since one has to discretize the soliton equation with respect to both time and space variables in the first stage . in the following discussion ,",
    "we call equations _ semi - discrete _ if the space variable is discrete , and _ full - discrete _ if both time and space variables are discrete .",
    "( note that , each for continuous soliton equations , there often exist a number of different semi - discrete and full - discrete equations that reduce to the same continuous equation . )    in this paper , we propose _ the ultra - discrete optimal velocity ( udov ) model _ derived from the ov model by the ultra - discrete method , and exact solution of the model .",
    "also , we present numerical simulation results to assess the validity of the ca model for traffic flow .",
    "the present result suggests a basic relation between deterministic traffic - flow models and the soliton equations , which contribute to theoretical studies of traffic flow .",
    "in order to obtain the udov model , we focus on the following facts : the ov model reduces to the mkdv equation in an appropriate scaling limit @xcite , and the mkdv equation is transformed into a sca @xcite . in addition , it is crucial that the delay ov model and the semi - discrete mkdv ( sdmkdv ) equation given in @xcite are to meet if one supposes a traveling - wave solution .      first , we shall review the ultra - discrete process of the mkdv equation given in @xcite , and see that it is natural to choose the delay ov model in the ultra - discrete process .    to begin with",
    ", we consider the full - discrete mkdv ( fdmkdv ) equation proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real parameters , and discrete time and discrete space variables are denoted respectively by super- and sub- scripts , @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "( note that we also use subscripts for partial differentiations as far as it does not cause confusion . )",
    "taking the limit @xmath29 after substitution @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ fdmkdv ] ) yields the sdmkdv equation or _ the modified lotka - volterra ( mlv ) equation _ @xmath31 where the time variable becomes continuous and we denote by dot differentiation in time .",
    "again , as for a scaling parameter @xmath23 which is introduced as @xmath32 taking the limit @xmath33 , we recover the mkdv equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 depends on continuous variables in both time and space , and subscripts denote partial differentiations in these variables .",
    "thus , one sees that it is plausible to adopt eq .",
    "( [ fdmkdv ] ) as the fdmkdv equation and eq .",
    "( [ mlv ] ) as the sdmkdv equation .",
    "the ultra - discrete method means the transformation of the dependent variable in full - discrete equations by the following formulas : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are called ultra - discrete variable . namely , the ultra - discrete method is done by taking the limit where the dependent variable diverges as the scaling parameter @xmath23 tends to zero .",
    "one may formally consider that the ultra - discrete method is to replace _ multiplication _ with _ plus _ , and _ plus _ with _ max _ as well .",
    "it is apparent that the commutative , associative , and distributive laws hold .    before applying the ultra - discrete method",
    ", we introduce another dependent variable in eq .",
    "( [ fdmkdv ] ) as @xmath39 thus , we have another form of the fdmkdv equation @xmath40 then we shall apply the ultra - discrete method for eq .",
    "( [ vtilde ] ) .",
    "the ultra - discrete variables are introduced for both the continuous dependent variable and the parameters as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath37 are integers . taking the limit @xmath43 ,",
    "one obtains the ultra - discrete mkdv ( udmkdv ) equation @xmath44 as far as we have integers as the initial value , @xmath45 takes integer values . especially if @xmath46 then eq . ( [ udmkdv ] ) reduces to @xmath47 .",
    "the udmkdv equation realizes _ the box and ball system with a carrier _ ( bbsc ) , which is an extended bbs .",
    "however , we omit further details since it is not necessary for our later discussion .",
    "refer to @xcite for more information about the bbsc .",
    "as described in the introduction , it has often been pointed out that there is a close relation of traffic - flow models to the soliton theory @xcite .",
    "now , following @xcite we show the direct connection between the delay ov model and the mlv equation , which has already appeared as a semi - discrete mkdv equation in eq .",
    "( [ mlv ] ) .",
    "we start with the delay ov model in the headway representation , i.e. , @xmath48 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ cfm ] ) and ( [ tanh ] ) . ) changing the variable , @xmath49 we have @xmath50 where we transfer @xmath2 to the right hand side for the latter discussion .",
    "then , if one assumes the traveling - wave solution @xmath51 eq .",
    "( [ dov ] ) yields @xmath52 meanwhile , the change of the variable in eq .",
    "( [ mlv ] ) , @xmath53 yields @xmath54 consequently , if one assumes @xmath55 eq .",
    "( [ rbar ] ) coincides with eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "the traveling - wave solution eq . ( [ travel ] ) means a traffic jam propagating to the upper stream at phase velocity @xmath56 .",
    "it is remarkable that this solution is numerically observed and also it appears independently of the initial condition .",
    "that means that the traveling - wave solution is stable to perturbations and is manifested as the stationary state in the long time limit .",
    "some exact solutions of eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) have been given by some research groups in different ways @xcite ; however , it is recently proven that these solutions are all identical @xcite .",
    "now , we introduce the fdov model before the udov model , based on the observations above .    according to eq .",
    "( [ r2rbar ] ) , we also change the variable in eq .",
    "( [ fdmkdv ] ) such as @xmath57 this leads to @xmath58 , and we thus have the fdmkdv equation @xmath59 which reduces to eq .",
    "( [ rbar ] ) in @xmath29 .    instead of eq .",
    "( [ travel ] ) , consider the following reduction in eq .",
    "( [ dov ] ) ( allowing half integers in the subscript ) , @xmath60 and we can thereby make the equation symmetric in both time and space .",
    "then , renumbering the space index ( i.e. , multiplying it by two ) , eq .",
    "( [ dov ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ rbar ] ) . in order to obtain the fdov model from eq .",
    "( [ fdmkdv2 ] ) , we assume the following reduction as the full - discrete analog of eq .",
    "( [ red ] ) : @xmath61 where we denote by @xmath62 the dependent variable for the fdov model and @xmath63 is a positive integer .    comparing eq .",
    "( [ travel ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ travel2 ] ) , one finds @xmath64 then , since @xmath65 is thought to be the unit of time in eq .",
    "( [ fdmkdv2 ] ) , we introduce the unit of time @xmath66 as @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ dov ] ) , and let @xmath68 thus , eq . ( [ red2 ] ) certainly reduces to eq .",

    "( [ dov ] ) .",
    "suppose the approximation mentioned in the introduction : @xmath2 is small enough for the reduction of the delay ov model to the ov model .",
    "then we should take @xmath71 which means @xmath72 .",
    "namely , @xmath2 is also regarded as the minimum unit of time .",
    "consequently , we obtain _ the full - discrete optimal velocity ( fdov ) model _ as @xmath73 in fact , eq . ( [ fdov ] ) is a second - order difference equation containing three sequential points of time : @xmath74 , @xmath5 , and @xmath75 , and which is consistent with the ov model , a second - order differential equation .",

    "in contrast with the case of eq .",

    "in this paper , we propose the ultra - discrete optimal velocity model , a cellular - automaton model which inherits the properties of the ov model such as the linear instability , and moreover have an exact solution of the model which describes a traffic jam propagating to the upper stream like a shock wave .",
    "since the ov model is defined by a nonlinear differential equation , ordinary discrete schemes do not work to obtain the corresponding difference equation .",
    "meanwhile , it is well - known that the ov model , around the critical point , reduces to the mkdv equation , a soliton equation , in a scaling limit . therefore , we apply the theory of soliton equations to the ov model so that the ca model obtained maintains the relation between the ov model and the mkdv equation described below .",
    "figure [ scheme ] shows our scheme of the present study . at the beginning , we pay attention to the fact that if one considers traveling - wave solutions , the delay ov model eq .",

    "( [ udov ] ) and an exact shock solution , and one sees the validity of the soliton theory for study of traffic flow .",
    "simulation results show that the udov model has a transition region where it is difficult for a uniform flow to maintain the headway under perturbations .",
    "( it is also remarkable that a deterministic traffic - flow model has such instability to perturbations . )",
    "moreover , we find that the system have three distinct states : a traffic jam ( absolutely unstable ) , an oscillatory pattern ( stop - and - go ) , and a free flow ( convectively unstable ) according to the uniform headway .",
    "in the present paper , we mainly focus on the theoretical study and do not have the necessity to have the model in position representation ; however in some cases the spatio - temporal patterns are also required .",
