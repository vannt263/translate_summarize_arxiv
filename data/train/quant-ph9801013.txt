    "it is well - known in molecular physics since the work by longuet - higgins and coworkers @xcite that adiabatically transporting the electronic state around a conical intersection in nuclear configuration space changes the sign of the electronic wave function .",
    "therefore the nuclear wave function must also change sign to make the total product wave function singlevalued .",

    "we here analyze the sign change problem from a noncyclic perspective .",
    "specifically , consider a two - dimensional subspace of nuclear configuration space in which two electronic states conically intersect at the origin . in a neighborhood of the degenerate point",
