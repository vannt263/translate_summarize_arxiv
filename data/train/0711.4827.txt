    "even a weak perturbation of an integrable system possessing a separatrix results in the onset of chaotic motion inside a layer@xcite which we shall further call as the separatrix chaotic layer ( sl ) .",
    "the separatrix chaos plays a fundamental role for the hamiltonian chaos , being also relevant to various applications@xcite .",
    "the boundaries of the sl in the poincar section may be easily found numerically@xcite .",
    "however , it is also important , both from the theoretical and practical points of view , to be able to _ theoretically _ calculate them and describe transport within the sl .",
    "one of the most powerful theoretical tools for the sl study is the separatrix map ( sm ) , introduced in @xcite for the nearly integrable systems with the 3/2 degrees of freedom and called sometimes@xcite as the zaslavsky separatrix map .",
    "it may also be generalized for systems with more degrees of freedom and for strongly non - integrable systems ( see @xcite for the most recent major review ) .",
    "we shall further consider the case of the 3/2 degrees of freedom but the generalization of our method for other cases may be done too .",
    "one of the most interesting for physical applications relevant quantities is the width of the sl in energy @xcite .",
    "there are various heuristic criteria @xcite based on the separatrix map and various conjectures .",
    "the width by these criteria does not depend on the angle and , as a function of a perturbation frequency @xmath0 , possesses a maximum at @xmath0 of the order of the eigenfrequency in the stable state @xmath1 while the maximum itself is of the order of the perturbation amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "however , the work @xcite has demonstrated in simulations for double - separatrix systems that the maximum width may be _ much larger _ as the sl absorbs one or two _ nonlinear resonances_. the recent work@xcite has proved this , developing a new method for the analysis of the separatrix map .",
    "the method is of a _ general _ validity , as shown in the _ present _ work .",
    "we show that the maximum width occurs at the frequency which is typically smaller than @xmath1 by the logarithmic factor @xmath3 while the maximum width is typically much larger than @xmath2 - either by a numerical factor or by the logarithmic factor ( apart from the adiabatic divergence in certain class of systems@xcite ) .",
    "besides , the method allows to describe major statistical properties of transport within the sl .",
    "note that there were various mathematical works considering the sl in rather different contexts ( see @xcite for the review ) .",
    "in particular , they analysed the sl width in normal coordinates .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , these works do not specify the relation between the normal coordinates and variables conventional in physics ( e.g. energy - angle or coordinate - momentum ) .",
    "besides , these works just estimate the width from above and below while our method allows to carry out an _ accurate _ calculation of the width in energy and , moreover , of the sl boundaries in the poincar section .",
    "finally and most importantly , the methods described in @xcite do not make a resolution between the resonance frequency range and other frequency ranges while our method shows that the sls in these ranges drastically differ from each other , as confirmed by simulations .",
    "below , we describe the basic ideas of our method ( sec .",
    "2 ) , review the results of its application to the double - separatrix case ( sec . 3 ) and",
    "present rough estimates for the single - separatrix case ( sec .",
    "consider any 1d hamiltonian system possessing at least one separatrix .",
    "let us add a weak time - periodic perturbation , @xmath4    the motion near any of the separatrices may be approximated by the separatrix map ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "the map slightly differs for different types of separatrix .",
    "our method applies to all types but , to be concrete , we consider in this section only the separatrix with a single saddle and two loops ( like in a double - well potential system )",
    ". then the sm reads as @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the separatrix energy . the quantity @xmath7 is often called as the melnikov@xcite or poincar - melnikov@xcite integral .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is sometimes called _ separatrix split_@xcite . for the sake of simplicity , let absolute values of all parameters of @xmath9 and of @xmath10 be @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 too , if @xmath13 .",
    "consider two most general ideas of the method .",
    "the sm trajectory that includes any state with @xmath14 is _ chaotic _ since the angle of this state is not correlated with the angle of the state at the preceding step of the map , due to the divergence of @xmath15 .",
    "the frequency of eigenoscillation as a function of energy is proportional to the reciprocal of the logarithmic factor :    @xmath16    ( @xmath17 are energies of the stable states ) .",
    "given that the argument of the logarithm is large in the relevant range of @xmath18 , the function @xmath19 is nearly constant at a rather significant variation of the argument .",
    "therefore , as the sm maps the state @xmath20 onto the state with @xmath21 , the value of @xmath22 for the given @xmath23 is nearly the same for most of angles @xmath24 ( except the close vicinity of @xmath25 multiples ) , namely    @xmath26    moreover , even if the deviation of the trajectory of the sm from the separatrix further increases / decreases , @xmath22 remains close to @xmath27 provided the deviation is not too large / small , namely if @xmath28 . if @xmath29 , then the evolution of the map ( 2 ) may be regular - like for a long time until the energy returns back to the close vicinity of the separatrix , where the correlation of angle is lost again .",
    "such a behavior is especially pronounced if the perturbation frequency is close to @xmath30 or @xmath31 or to one of their multiples of a not too high order : the resonance between the perturbation and eigenoscillation gives rise to an accumulation of the energy gain for many steps of the sm , which results in the deviation of @xmath18 from @xmath6 greatly exceeding the separatrix split @xmath32 . as a function of @xmath0 , the largest ( along the sl boundary ) deviation from the separatrix takes its maximum at the frequencies slightly exceeding @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for the upper and lower boundaries of the sl respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the absorption of the nonlinear resonance by the sl .",
    "the description of the regular - like parts of the chaotic trajectory in the case close to the resonance may be done within the resonance approximation .",
    "the explicit matching between the sm and the resonance approximation is carried out in @xcite .",
    "the resonance approximation is done in terms of slow variables , action @xmath33 ( note that @xmath34 ) and slow angle @xmath35 , by means of the resonance hamiltonian @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "schematically illustrates the formation of the upper boundary of the sl in the poincar section presented in the @xmath37 variables .",
    "the chaotic trajectory jumps from the separatrix onto the curve which we call the upper _ generalized separatrix split _ ( gss ) curve , within an even @xmath25 interval :    @xmath38,\\quad\\quad n=0,\\pm 1 , \\pm 2 , ...",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the gss curve relates to the sm equation for @xmath18 with @xmath39 .",
    "the relevance of just the even @xmath25 intervals of @xmath40 is a consequence of a necessarily _ positive _ sign of @xmath41 as far as we consider the _ upper _ boundary of the sl .",
    "then the system follows the trajectory of the resonance hamiltonian @xmath42 ( @xmath18 necessarily increases initially because @xmath43 is within an even @xmath25 interval ) , until it again reaches the gss curve ( necessarily in an odd @xmath25 interval , where @xmath18 decreases ) .",
    "after that , the system jumps onto the separatrix , where the angle correlation is lost .",
    "there is a statistical distribution of regular - like parts of the chaotic trajectory corresponding to the homogeneous distribution of initial angles .",
    "the boundary of the sl is formed by the trajectory of the resonance hamiltonian ( rt ) starting from the gss curve at such initial angle that provides for the deviation of the rt from the separatrix to be larger than that for any other initial angle . from the topological point of view",
    ", there may be two different situations : either the relevant rt is _ tangent _ to the gss curve ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) or it intersects it while being a self - intersecting trajectory i.e. a _ separatrix _ of the resonance hamiltonian ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the _ outer _",
    "boundary is formed by the _ outer _ part of the separatrix ( in fig .",
    "1(b ) , relating to the upper boundary , this part lies above the saddle @xmath44 ; an example of the boundary formed by the separatrix of a different type is shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) ) .",
    "the boundary strongly depends on the angle .",
    "the maximal / minimal deviation of @xmath18 from @xmath6 is much larger / smaller than @xmath45 .    0.1 in",
    "it has been found in @xcite that , if the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath9 possesses more than one separatrix ( cf .",
    "2 ) while the perturbation is time - periodic , the onset of global chaos in between the adjacent separatrices possesses a remarkable feature : it is greatly facilitated if the perturbation frequency @xmath0 is close to certain frequencies : the perturbation amplitude @xmath2 required for the chaos onset is much smaller for such frequencies than for others ( fig .",
    "this is related to the characteristic shape of @xmath22 in between the separatrices : @xmath22 approaches a _ rectangular _ form in the asymptotic limit of a small separation between the separatrices ( cf .",
    "if @xmath0 is slightly smaller than the local maximum @xmath46 of @xmath22 , then there are two nonlinear resonances that are very wide in energy : they may simultaneously overlap each other and the separatrix chaotic layers , that occurs at the value of @xmath2 which is logarithmically smaller than a typical value required for the chaos onset when @xmath0 lies beyond the immediate vicinity of @xmath46 .    using the semi - heuristic approach ,",
    "the lowest - order asymptotic theory based on the resonance hamiltonian analysis was developed in @xcite for the minima of the global chaos boundary @xmath47 .",
    "the theory was compared to results of computer simulations for the given example ( for a moderately small separation : fig .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in the minimum was well described by the lowest - order formula but the descrepancy for @xmath48 in the minimum was nearly 50@xmath49 . besides , it was unclear how the overlap of resonances with the chaotic layers occured and why even a small excess of @xmath2 over @xmath48 resulted in the onset of chaos in a large area of the poincar section despite that chaotic layers associated with the nonlinear resonances were exponentially narrow for @xmath50 .",
    "these problems have been resolved in our recent work@xcite developing the method similar to that described in the previous section .",
    "the agreement between the theory and simulations has greatly improved ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) .    our present work generalizes the above method for _ any separatrix _ ( see sec . 2 above and sec . 4 below ) .",
    "the general validity of the method is brightly demonstrated by fig .",
    "4 , that shows the direct comparison of the theoretical sl boundaries and the sls generated by computer .",
    "though the layers are still related to the system with two separatrices , the given perturbation amplitude is so small that the layers are well separated from each other and therefore the presence of a second separatrix does not play a significant role for any of the layers .",
    "the lower and upper layers demonstrate two characteristic situations : the lower layer has not yet absorbed the relevant nonlinear resonance ( though the closeness to the resonance gives rise to a rather strong increase of the layer width ) while the upper layer has absorbed the resonance so that its maximal width greatly exceeds that of the lower layer and there is a large island of stability in the layer .    0.2 in",
    "as already mentioned , the sl width in energy takes its maximum at @xmath51 . the rigorous treatment for the single - separatrix case",
    "may be done similar to the double - separatrix case @xcite .",
    "it will be done elsewhere while , here , we present rough estimates for the width .            the maximum width of the sl corresponds to the perturbation frequency at which the sl has just absorbed the widest _ nonlinear resonance _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . from the rigorous results for the double - separatrix case@xcite",
    ", we may assume that the sl width is dominated by the width of the nonlinear resonance then , i.e. the width of the resonance separatrix in energy @xmath60 greatly exceeds the minimal separation in energy between the resonance separatrix and @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , this assumption should be verified in the end .    strictly speaking",
    ", @xmath61 strongly depends on @xmath62 in the relevant range of @xmath62 , end the rigorous treatment of the nonlinear resonance is complicated ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . but for a rough estimate of the resonance width , it is sufficient to use a simple chirikov approximation of the resonance hamiltonian @xmath36 @xcite , which reduces to the auxiliary pendulum dynamics .",
    "the width of the corresponding resonance separatrix in energy is expressed as      the chirkov approximation assumes that @xmath64 within the range of energies relevant to the resonance separatrix . in our case",
    ", it is not so since the quantity @xmath65 .",
    "then we obtain for @xmath60 the following rough asymptotic equation          * 1 . *",
    "the separatrix of the unperturbed system has _ more than one saddle _ while the relevant coefficient @xmath69 in the fourier expansion ( in time ) of the perturbation @xmath10 possesses _ different _ values in adjacent saddles .",
    "an archetypal example is a pendulum subject to a dipole time - periodic perturbation @xcite .",
    "if @xmath18 is close to @xmath6 , then the system stays mostly near one of the saddles , so that @xmath70 depends on @xmath53 nearly in a piece - wise manner : it oscillates between the values corresponding to the adjacent saddles .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 ( which is the absolute value of the relevant coefficient in the fourier expansion of @xmath70 in @xmath53 ) approaches in the asymptotic limit @xmath71 some _ non - zero _ constant . as follows from eq .",
    "( 8) , @xmath60 is _ logarithmically large _ :",
    "either the separatrix has a _ single _ saddle ( like for a double - well potential system @xcite ) or the separatrix has more than one saddle while the perturbation possesses _ identically equal _ values at different saddles .",
    "archetypal examples are a pendulum in a wave with the same spatial period @xcite and a pendulum with the oscillating suspension point @xcite",
    ". then @xmath73 keeps nearly one and the same value for most of the period of @xmath53 ( as it stays most of the period near the saddle / s ) : it significantly differs from this value only during a small part of the period , which is @xmath74 .",
    "hence , @xmath75 , so that the solution of eq .",
    "( 9 ) is :      this means that the asymptotic functional dependence of the resonance width is the same as that of the sl width in frequency ranges beyond the resonance .",
    "so , the functional dependence of the sl in the resonance range is of the same type as beyond it , being @xmath77 . at the same time",
    ", a ratio between the resonance width and @xmath2 may still be a large number .",
    "both these conclusions are in agreement with computer simulations .",
    "thus , for the archetypal example of the duffing oscillator subject to the dipole time - periodic perturbation @xcite , the ratio @xmath78 approaches in the limit @xmath71 the constant value approximately equal to 20 : see fig .",
    "3(b ) in @xcite . for another archetypal example , namely a pendulum in the wave of the same spatial period @xcite",
    ", our recent simulations for the parameters exploited in @xcite have shown that @xmath79 ."
