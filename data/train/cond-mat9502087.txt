    "recently , there has been a growing interest in the study of interfaces with non - trivial geometry .",
    "such interfaces arise in a variety of situations including domain walls in random magnets,@xcite fluid invasion in porous media@xcite , spreading on heterogeneous surfaces@xcite , membranes and vesicles in biology,@xcite and epitaxial growth in materials science.@xcite    in connection with such problems it is natural to ask whether quantum effects play a significant role . for static properties",
    "it is well established that in nonrandom systems , such as a spin @xmath0 antiferromagnet , with only a nearest neighbor exchange interaction , @xmath10 , there are various regimes . near the critical temperature at @xmath11 ,",
    "thermal fluctuations are dominant . in the ordered phase ,",
    "as long as @xmath12 , quantum effects due to the finiteness of @xmath0 are unimportant . for @xmath13",
    "one is in a quantum regime , where the quantum statistics of spin waves and their interactions leads to dependences on @xmath0 and @xmath14 not present in the classical ( @xmath15 ) limit .",
    "heuristic arguments indicate that quantum effects could influence the nature of domain walls in spin systems . in the picture in which the trajectory of the domain wall is likened to the trajectory of a particle in space as a function of time , quantum effects",
    "cause a smearing out of the trajectory .",
    "for such a system analytic and numerical work is obviously very difficult .",
    "accordingly , we have been led to carry out a program of analytic work for quantum domain walls in one dimension . for this purpose",
    "we consider domain walls at zero temperature @xmath14 in the spin @xmath0 ising model ( with nearest - neighbor exchange coupling @xmath10 ) in a transverse field , @xmath5 , whose hamiltonian is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a quantum spin @xmath0 operator at site @xmath18 .    to study domain walls in this model we introduce boundary conditions in which the spin at one end of the chain is fixed to be `` up '' and that at the other end is fixed to be `` down . ''",
    "this model has some interest in its own right .",
    "for @xmath19 its properties can , in principle , be related to those of the associated free fermion model obtained via the jordan - wigner@xcite transformation .",
    "however , with domain - wall boundary conditions , this relation is not easy to implement .",
    "accordingly , we approach the analysis of the properties of domain walls in this model via perturbation theory for @xmath20 and more generally via numerical solution for the wave functions and energies of the ground state and the low - lying excited states . needless to say , some of the properties of this model in one dimension can not be extrapolated to higher dimensional systems . however , in most cases , one can safely say which features can be so extrapolated and which can not .",
    "we may summarize our results for the one dimensional model as follows .",
    "the magnetization profile has a width of order the length of the chain .",
    "the low - lying excited states comprise a manifold of `` particle '' states , which results when the center of the wall propagates from site to site .",
    "these results are easily understood within perturbation theory in @xmath21 . in the classical limit",
    "the width of the wall is of order the correlation length , i. e. it is of order a lattice constant , as long as one is far from the critical regime at @xmath22 , above which long range order disappears . in the classical limit and for small @xmath21",
    ", we evaluate a barrier energy , analogous to the peierls - nabarro energy,@xcite which prevents the free motion of the domain wall .",
    "when the correlation length becomes very large this barrier energy becomes small and since it is harder to calculate in this limit , we did not attempt such calculations",
    ". it would be interesting to calculate this energy for a quantum system , but in the present case , since the width of the wall is of order @xmath7 , we can say that this barrier energy vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . also , in the large @xmath0 limit , we find that the quantum hopping of the domain wall from one site to the next is actually analogous to a tunneling process , so that the hopping matrix element is not of order @xmath5 , as it is for the low spin case , but is now of order @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "it would be of some interest to recover this result within a field theory of one space and one time dimension to describe such a quantum effect .",
    "briefly , this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we define the class of models we will analyze in one dimension . in sec .",
    "iii we give numerical results for the magnetization profile for @xmath19 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and compare these to analytic results we obtain using perturbation theory in the small @xmath21 limit . in sec .",
    "iv we give analytic results for large @xmath0 .",
    "the classical results for @xmath27 are given both in the continuum limit ( i.e. , when the wall is very broad ) and in the discrete limit ( when the wall is very narrow ) .",
    "here we also analyze the quantum system for large @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "v we give various results concerning the nature of the energy spectrum in the presence of a domain wall .",
    "we give numerical and analytic results for the nature of the particle spectrum caused by the matrix element which allows the wall to hop from one site to the next . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we summarize the conclusions to be drawn from our work .",
    "the first one - dimensional model we consider is the spin @xmath0 ising model in a transverse field , with the hamiltonian @xmath28 this formulation of the model has the advantages that a ) the domain wall energy ( for @xmath29 ) is independent of the value of @xmath0 and is equal to @xmath10 , and b ) the mean - field transition temperature @xmath30 ( at which significant correlations begin to develop between neighboring spins ) is of order @xmath10 independent of @xmath0 . to discuss domain walls , the spins @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "will be fixed by boundary conditions , as discussed below .",
    "thus @xmath7 is the number of `` active '' spins in the chain .",
    "we will often use the notation @xmath33 .",
    "we will also consider the ",
    "yz \" model in a transverse field , for which the hamiltonian is @xmath34 the most important difference between these two models is that the interaction term ( proportional to @xmath35 ) in @xmath36 allows the spins to tip away from the @xmath4-axis . for @xmath29 and with free - end boundary conditions , the  y - z \" model with @xmath37 has the continuous @xmath38 symmetry instead of the discrete @xmath39 symmetry of the ising model which results when @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , we recall the ground state phase diagram@xcite of this more general model , shown in fig . 1 for spin @xmath41 , where one sees ( at zero temperature ) the disordered phase ( d ) , the ordered ferromagnetic ising phase ( f ) , and the ordered oscillatory phase ( o ) .",
    "in both ordered phases the spontaneous magnetization @xmath42 is non - vanishing ( where @xmath43 denotes the thermodynamic average at temperature @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , the ( connected ) two - point correlation function , @xmath44 , behaves as follows@xcite for @xmath45 : @xmath46 where the correlation length @xmath47 is a known function of @xmath48 and @xmath35 in each of the three phases , @xmath49 is a constant and @xmath50 .",
    "when going from phase f to phase o , there is a new diverging length @xmath51 , which is not simply related to a gap in the spectrum of @xmath36 ( as is @xmath47 ) , but indicates the wavelength at which the correlation function at large distances oscillates under an exponentially decaying envelope .    to discuss the width and energy of a domain wall",
    ", we shall work with `` up - down '' boundary conditions , in which we require @xmath52 we can then study the profile of the wall by evaluating    @xmath53    where @xmath54 denotes the ground state . as we discuss in more detail below , in order to obtain a spin profile for a _",
    "quantum _ system , antiperiodic boundary conditions which introduce a boundary coupling @xmath55 _ can not _ be used in a naive way . however , for a classical system such antiperiodic boundary conditions will prove convenient .",
    "the energy of the domain wall , @xmath56 , is defined to be @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the energy with `` up - down '' or antiperiodic boundary conditions and @xmath59 that with `` up - up '' or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we begin by presenting numerical results for the profile function @xmath62 for the ferromagnetic phase f. for general spin we are constrained to rather small systems , since the number of quantum states is @xmath63 for @xmath7 sites ( excluding the fixed boundary spins ) .",
    "so why not use translational symmetry to reduce the number of states ?",
    "indeed , that would be possible for the special case of antiperiodic boundary conditions ( with @xmath64 ) mentioned in the previous section .",
    "these boundary conditions are peculiar since @xmath65 commutes with the modified translation operator @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the usual translation operator and @xmath68 changes the sign of @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , @xmath65 can be decomposed ( for any @xmath70 ) into a block diagonal form .",
    "the corresponding states are said to be in the even or odd sector , respectively , depending on their parity under spin reversal .",
    "furthermore , @xmath71 in that case and one should consider instead the quantity @xmath72 where @xmath54 and @xmath73 are the ground states in the even and odd sectors ( with respect to the ising symmetry ) of the model , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that at least for _ periodic _ boundary conditions this defines@xcite a sensible finite - lattice approximation to the order parameter ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "however , for @xmath64 , even for @xmath7 finite , there are two _ degenerate _ states @xmath73 , @xmath74 in the odd sector , one of which gives rise to the desired wall profile , while the profile of the other one is essentially flat . on the other hand , for @xmath75 , one does get a wall profile , but its shape depends on the value of @xmath76 .",
    "we avoid these problems by choosing the `` up - down '' boundary conditions defined above in eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since we are interested in situations far from criticality , the convergence of the finite - size data with @xmath77 is usually quite rapid so that the moderate sizes achieved are sufficient for our purposes .    the determination of the lowest eigenstates of the hamiltonians @xmath78 and @xmath36 using the lanczos algorithm is fairly standard@xcite . from the ground state @xmath54",
    "we calculate the local magnetization @xmath79 @xmath80    our results pertaining to the ferromagnetic phase f are as follows . in fig .",
    "2 , we display @xmath79 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath41 for various values of @xmath7 . with the exception of the smallest @xmath7-values used , we first observe that the data collapse onto a single curve , which implies that the @xmath7 considered are already sufficiently large as compared to the correlation length that they represent the @xmath83 limit .",
    "second , we note that the profile is quite wide and a continuous function of @xmath84 .",
    "we find a similar data collapse for all the situations we are going to consider in the sequel .",
    "next , we show in fig .",
    "3 , that the overall shape of the profile is not a peculiarity of having spin @xmath41 .",
    "rather , we see that the profiles obtained with the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "3a ) and @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "3b ) both spins @xmath25 and @xmath86 are very close to the one for @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless , the finer details of the respective shapes become different as @xmath5 increases . finally , in fig .",
    "4 , we show the effect of varying @xmath48 in the @xmath41 case .",
    "note that the profiles for a transverse field as small as @xmath87 and as large as @xmath81 are superimposed onto each other .",
    "the fact that the width @xmath88 of the domain wall is proportional to the size of the system is a peculiarity of a one dimensional quantum model . in higher dimensions we would expect @xmath88 to remain finite as @xmath83 except possibly at a critical point where the correlation length diverges .",
    "we shall turn to a quantitative explanation of these findings below .",
    "profiles for the oscillatory phase are discussed in subsection c.      in order to gain some understanding of the results of the last section , we now present some simple approximate calculations . as it turns out ,",
    "most of the physics of the problem for @xmath48 small is conveniently described in terms of degenerate perturbation theory involving the manifold @xmath89 of the @xmath90 ground states .",
    "this procedure avoids the additional technical complications of the free fermion method for `` up - down '' boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions are that spin @xmath31 is fixed to have @xmath91 and spin @xmath32 has @xmath92 . for @xmath19 the manifold @xmath93 contains the states @xmath94 , for @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes the quantum state ( shown in fig .",
    "5 ) in which spins @xmath97 with @xmath98 have their @xmath4-component of spin equal to @xmath99 and those with @xmath100 have their @xmath4-component of spin equal to @xmath101 .",
    "the only nonzero matrix elements of the hamiltonian within the ground manifold are @xmath102 considering only the manifold @xmath93 , one finds the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath103 , and eigenenergies @xmath59 ( for @xmath104 ) to be @xmath105 |n \\rangle \\ , \\ \\ \\ \\ e_p = e_0 + h \\cos [ p \\pi / ( l+2 ) ] \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath106 is a normalization constant .",
    "perturbative corrections to the energy will occur at order @xmath107 and to the wavefunction at order @xmath21 .",
    "we may calculate the profile function within the small @xmath48 approximation : @xmath108 - \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sin^2 [ kp \\pi / ( l+2 ) ] \\over \\sum_{k=1}^{l+1 } \\sin^2 [ kp \\pi / ( l+2 ) ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 1 - 2 { \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sin^2 [ kp \\pi / ( l+2 ) ] \\over \\sum_{k=1}^{l+1 } \\sin^2 [ kp \\pi / ( l+2 ) ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 1 - 2 { ( 2n+1 ) \\sin { p \\pi \\over l+2 } - \\sin { ( 2n+1)p \\pi \\over l+2 } \\over ( 2l+3 ) \\sin { p \\pi \\over l+2 } - \\sin { ( 2l+3)p \\pi \\over l+2 } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we set @xmath109 and work in the limit of infinite @xmath7 .",
    "thereby we find @xmath110 in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath111 is shown together with the numerically determined ground - state profiles @xmath79 for @xmath41 , @xmath25 and @xmath86 and we find a nice qualitative agreement ( even for moderately large values of @xmath48 ) .",
    "the above calculation can be generalized to larger @xmath0 .",
    "consider a state in which the wall is between lattice sites .",
    "in this state let all spins to the left of the wall have @xmath91 and those to the right have @xmath92 . note that it is possible to change the value of @xmath6 for _ either one _ ( but not simultaneously both ) of the spins adjacent to the wall without changing the unperturbed ( @xmath90 ) energy .",
    "for spin @xmath25 since the nonzero matrix elements of the perturbation due to the transverse field are all the same , the problem is totally equivalent to a spin 1/2 chain of twice the length .",
    "this observation explains the fact that our results for @xmath19 and @xmath25 are indistinguishable .",
    "when @xmath112 , one has to account for the fact that to move the wall through one lattice constant involves matrix elements which depend on the initial and final values of @xmath6 .",
    "this case will be considered later .",
    "the discussion has been so far restricted to the ferromagnetic phase f. the oscillatory phase is distinguished from it by showing a non - monotonic decrease of the correlation function [ see eq . ( [ corrs ] ) ] .",
    "how does this behavior manifest itself on the level of the magnetization profile @xmath79 ?    to answer this question , we display in fig .",
    "6a , for @xmath41 , @xmath79 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 and for @xmath7 _ even_. indeed , this profile is distinct form the ones observed previously in the phase f. first , finite - size effects are much larger than in the situations discussed before .",
    "second , @xmath79 displays , at least for @xmath7 finite , a step - like behavior and it looks as if the system was built out of hard objects each occupying two lattice sites . when @xmath48 is increased , these composites soften until they completely melt at the transition towards the f phase .",
    "this picture is modified in interesting ways for @xmath7 _ odd_. in fact , the calculation of @xmath79 requires a little more care in this case . for @xmath7 even , the system has a single well - defined ground state separated by a gap at least of order @xmath115 ( see sec .",
    "v ) from the excited states .",
    "that is not so for @xmath7 odd .",
    "rather , for @xmath90 but @xmath116 , one finds that the ground state is twofold degenerate .",
    "that is a new degeneracy which has nothing to do with the ferromagnetic ordering of the system .",
    "even when @xmath117 , the two lowest states in @xmath89 remain much closer to each other than with the other states , the latter one having gaps of order @xmath118 .",
    "this new ( near ) degeneracy implies that one must reconsider the calculation of the magnetization profile @xmath79 . rather than blindly using eq .",
    "( [ magpro ] ) , we take the _ two _ ground states @xmath54 and @xmath119 to be nearly degenerate .",
    "then we construct the matrix @xmath120 and find its two eigenvalues @xmath121 .",
    "each of those represents a magnetization profile and one of them is shown in fig .",
    "the other profile is obtained by reflection around @xmath122 . the asymmetry in fig .",
    "6b , observed for @xmath7 odd and finite , is easily understood in terms of the composite objects introduced above .",
    "note that within the manifold @xmath93 , the @xmath123 term in the hamiltonian moves the wall through two lattice spaces .",
    "since we are discussing @xmath90 , this is the only kinetic energy of the domain wall .",
    "thus , if we write @xmath124 , where @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) is the submanifold of state in which there are an even ( odd ) number of up spins , then there are no matrix elements between these two submanifolds .",
    "furthermore , these two submanifolds are related to one another by spatial inversion ( accompanied by @xmath127 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath7 odd , the problem decomposes into two identical eigenvalue problems ( hence the twofold degeneracy of the energies ) .",
    "the matrix to be diagonalized is exactly the one considered in sec .",
    "iii.b , but now for @xmath128 sites and with @xmath129 .",
    "the two sets of eigenstates are thus @xmath130 ) diagonal .",
    "writing @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , we find for the profile for the @xmath133 set of eigenstates ( indicated by a subscript `` @xmath133 '' ) @xmath134 in particular , this reproduces the steps in @xmath135 observed numerically .",
    "now , taking the continuum limit , it is easy to see that the width of the terraces decreases as @xmath77 and that @xmath136 .",
    "we therefore suggest that the phenomenon observed in fig .",
    "7 is a novel type of finite - size effect . as @xmath77 , the step - like and asymmetric profiles found for @xmath7 finite will converge towards a smooth and symmetric limit function .    at least for @xmath137 , this limit function appears to show a simple relationship with the profiles previously found in the f phase .",
    "indeed , our data suggest the following .",
    "the profiles for @xmath7 large as found for @xmath138 are very close to those obtained for @xmath139 . for small @xmath35",
    "our analytic work shows this to be true with @xmath140 . for larger @xmath35 we have the phenomenological result ,",
    "@xmath141 evidence for this is provided in fig .",
    "7 , where some profiles found for @xmath90 and @xmath116 ( data points ) are collapsed with profiles calculated with @xmath142 .",
    "in this section we obtain several analytic results in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we first analyze the classical ( @xmath15 ) system .",
    "then we treat the quantum system with @xmath0 large , but not infinite .    to treat the classical ( @xmath27 ) system , we write @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a continuous classical variable",
    ". then the energy of the classical system is @xmath145 for the classical calculation without a wall , we will adopt periodic boundary conditions , so that @xmath146 and the last term in eq . ( [ eclass ] ) runs from @xmath147 to @xmath148 . in that case @xmath149 , where , for convenience , we set @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the critical value of @xmath48 above which long - range ising order disappears . for the periodic chain the energy per spin , @xmath152 , is given by @xmath153    in the classical calculations we will use two types of boundary conditions to generate a wall .",
    "the first type of boundary condition is used for the continuum calculation . here",
    "the number of sites is infinite and hence we set @xmath154 .",
    "this continuum calculation is valid when the angle @xmath144 changes slowly with position , as it does for @xmath155 .",
    "the second type of boundary condition is that used in the discrete calculation .",
    "here it is convenient to use antiperiodic boundary conditions in which spins at opposite ends of the chain are coupled antiferromagnetically , with @xmath64 and we require @xmath156 .    in any case , the ground state energy is found by minimizing @xmath58 with respect to the @xmath144 s .",
    "apart from end effects this minimization yields the following conditions ( for @xmath157 ) which characterize the exact ground state , @xmath158      for small @xmath159 the angle @xmath144 will change abruptly at the domain wall and we will treat this case in the next subsection . as @xmath159 increases ( up to the critical value @xmath160 ) , @xmath161 will become a smoother function of @xmath18 . in that case",
    ", a continuum approximation for @xmath161 makes sense . to treat the continuum limit for @xmath155 , we set @xmath162 , where @xmath163 , whence eq .",
