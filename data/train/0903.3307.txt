    "theoretical interpretations are given for their luminous hard x - rays as the thermal emission from high - temperature plasma produced by strong shocks due to the colliding winds @xcite .",
    "the interpretation is supported by the x - ray modulation observed along the orbital motion in some cwbs @xcite .",
    "cwbs are also expected to be an agent of cosmic particle acceleration , which is evidenced by the presence of non - thermal radio emission from e.g. , wr140 @xcite .",
    "charged particles with an energy distribution deviating from the maxwellian distribution give rise to the x - ray emission harder than the thermal emission dominant below 10  kev , thus the presence and the process of particle acceleration in cwbs can be best studied in the super - hard x - ray band . for convenience",
    ", we refer to the 512  kev range as `` hard '' x - ray band , while the @xmath215  kev range as `` super - hard '' x - ray band .",
    "the investigation of the super - hard emission from cwbs is important to unveil their enigmatic nature , and possibly gives a clue to understand the origin of @xmath3-ray emission reported from some massive star clusters containing cwbs @xcite .",
    "we anticipate a great leap in our comprehension of non - thermal phenomena in cwbs with the advent of x - ray imaging telescopes in the super - hard band , which will be deployed in the next generation x - ray satellites such as astro - h @xcite . at present , however , our tool is limited to non - imaging or coded - mask techniques in this band , leaving @xmath0 carina the only practical target for this subject .",
    "@xmath0 car is a luminous blue variable in the carina nebula at a distance of 2.3  kpc @xcite .",
    "it is considered to constitute a binary system with another massive star with an orbital period of 2022.7@xmath41.3 d @xcite in a highly eccentric orbit @xcite . in this paper , we use the orbital phase such that the start of the cycle 11 minimum is phase 1.0 on the julian date of 2452819.8 d @xcite or 2003 june 29.3 .",
    "@xmath0 car is one of the brightest stellar hard x - ray sources , and the hard x - ray modulation along the proposed ephemeris endorses the colliding - wind origin of the emission @xcite .",
    "the development of the x - ray light curve through an orbital phase is as follows ; it experiences an eclipse from phase 0 to 0.03 ( we call `` minimum '' ) , recovers its brightness spending @xmath50.02 phases ( `` recovery '' ) , and gradually increases the flux for the rest of the phase ( `` steady increase '' ) to reach the brightest point ( `` maximum '' ) , which is terminated by the repeated eclipse in the next phase @xcite .",
    "the periastron and the apastron are supposed to occur around phase 0.0 and 0.5 , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) . during the development ,",
    "@xmath0 car shows episodic flares @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 car below 10  kev has been described by complex models comprised of several thin - thermal plasma components with different temperatures , but a single plasma component of a 34  kev temperature dominates the hard band emission @xcite .",
    "x - ray studies of @xmath0 car in the super - hard band were conducted by two observatories to date .",
    "one is by bepposax using a combination of a gas scintillation proportional counter ( mecs ; medium energy concentrator spectrometer ) below 10  kev and a non - imaging phoswich scintillators ( pds ; phoswich detection system ) above 15  kev . @xcite and @xcite constrained the parameters of the 34  kev plasma component using the hard band data by the mecs , and extrapolated the model to claim that the pds data contain excess emission upon the 34  kev thermal emission .",
    "the other is by the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) using a coded - mask imager ( isgri ; the integral soft gamma - ray imager ) in the 15  kev1  mev range . @xcite",
    "unambiguously confirmed the super - hard emission claimed by the bepposax studies , showing that the isgri image has a significant signal at the position of @xmath0 car .    when it comes to characterizing the spectrum of the super - hard excess emission , the results produced by the two observatories have a limited use with some concerns .",
    "the pds is a non - imaging instrument with a wide field of view of in the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) , thus the contamination by other sources is inevitable . indeed ,",
    "as was pointed out by @xcite , two neighboring super - hard sources ( igrj104476027 and 1e1048.15937 ) are within the pds field of view , which significantly contribute to the pds spectrum of @xmath0 car .",
    "the isgri resolved super hard emission from @xmath0 car and is free from the contamination by these two sources .",
    "however , its spectrum does not have rich statistics with only three spectral bins for a total of a 1  ms exposure .",
    "the flux variation can not be tested .",
    "also , the excess emission was examined against the extrapolated model of the 34  kev thermal emission obtained by the mecs at a different epoch , which may not be very appropriate given the variable nature of the hard x - rays of @xmath0 car .",
    "the detection and the characterization of the excess emission in the super - hard band heavily depend on the accurate characterization and subtraction of the 34  kev thermal emission .",
    "the examination of the excess emission is straight - forward , but it requires a careful treatment since the extrapolation of the 34  kev thermal model needs to be stretched for nearly an order of magnitude in the energy range .    with these concerns ,",
    "it is not surprising that the bepposax and the integral data resulted in a serious disagreement with each other for the super - hard excess emission . while the former claims the power - law model of a photon index of 2.42@xmath40.04 , the latter claims 1@xmath40.4 .",
    "moreover , the flux estimates are inconsistent significantly by a factor of 3 .",
    "it is unclear , in the first place , whether the super - hard excess emission is of a thermal or a non - thermal origin .    to mitigate some of these concerns in the previous studies , we present the 550  kev results of suzaku observations conducted in 2005 august and 2006 february .",
    "the non - imaging detector in the super - hard band on board suzaku has a narrower field of view than that of the pds and is free from the contamination by the two neighboring super hard sources . the x - ray charge coupled devices ( ccds ) sensitive below 12  kev have good and well - calibrated responses in the hard band .",
    "their spectroscopic capability outperforms that of the mecs , resolving emission lines in the fe and ni k complex in the 6.08.5  kev band and thus enabling an accurate temperature determination of the 34  kev plasma sufficient to extrapolate toward the super - hard band .",
    "we present the spectral models to explain the 550  kev emission of @xmath0 car at two epochs around the apastron .",
    "we examine the thermal or non - thermal nature of the super hard excess emission and investigate its flux variability .",
    "the results will set a firm basis to study the development of the super - hard emission in an entire orbital cycle , which we plan to conduct in a separate paper with the new data obtained at the end of 2008 during the latest x - ray maximum and minimum .",
    "( 180mm,85mm)f1.eps    the suzaku satellite @xcite observed the carina nebula multiple times since its launch .",
    "we present the results of @xmath0 car in the first two observations on 2005 august 29 and 2006 february 3 in this paper , during which the object was around the apastron at the orbital phases of 1.39 and 1.47 , respectively ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",

    "the xis is an imaging spectrometer using x - ray ccds with a format of 1024@xmath71024 pixels .",
    "four ccd cameras are installed in the focal planes of four x - ray telescope modules @xcite coaligned with each other .",
    "three of the four cameras ( xis 0 , 2 , and 3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) devices and the remaining one ( xis1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) .",
    "the fi and the bi ccds have superior sensitivity to each other in the hard and the soft bands , respectively .",

    ", we use the pin component sensitive at 1070  kev with an fwhm energy resolution of 3.0  kev .",
    "the pin detector is composed of 64 si pin diodes installed at the bottom of 8@xmath78 well - type collimators surrounded by gso scintillators .",

    "the center of the pin field is 35 offset from that of the the xis field .",
    "thanks to the surrounding anti - coincidence scintillators , the narrow field of view , and the low background environment in the orbit , the pin achieves unprecedented sensitivity in the super - hard band .    in both observations , the xis is operated in the normal clocking mode with a frame time of 8  s. we used the cleaned event lists produced by the pipeline processing version 2.0 .",
    "the net exposure times are compiled in table  [ t1 ] .",

    "three point sources are recognized besides @xmath0 car : hd93250 , hd93205 , and wr25 , all of which are massive stars in this region . the underlying diffuse emission , which is a combination of unresolved point sources and the soft extended emission @xcite , is noticeable particularly in the western half of the image .",
    "the second observation produced a similar image .    in order to construct the xis spectra , we extracted the source and the background events from the solid and the dashed circles in figure  [ f1 ] ( b ) , respectively .",

    "the background region is selected from a region devoid of bright emission .",
    "the pile - up is negligible .",
    "the wings of other point sources and the underlying diffuse emission contribute to the background , which is negligible in our targeted energy range .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that the emission above 5  kev at the x - ray minimum of @xmath0 car , which gives the upper limit to the contamination by irrelevant emission , is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the x - ray bright phase @xcite .",
    "we constructed hard band light curves of the count rate during the 50 and 21  ks exposures in the first and the second observations , respectively , and found no significant flux changes such as flare - like variability ( figure  [ f8 ] ) .",

    "we speculate that the lower flux in the integral data is a consequence of the fact that the integral spectrum was accumulated in periods including the orbital eclipse , during which the super - hard emission may be absent .",
    "the emission mechanism of the super - hard excess x - rays and the production mechanism of the charged particles ( mostly electrons ) to produce the radiation are two different problems .",
    "for the emission mechanism , we consider the bremsstrahlung and the inverse compton radiations .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission is either thermal stemming from thermally - relaxed high - temperature plasma or non - thermal from accelerated charged particles with a non - thermal energy distribution .",
    "first , we consider the thermal bremsstrahlung by a thermally - relaxed plasma . in an adiabatic strong shock ,",
    "the post shock temperature is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the average particle mass in the unit of the proton mass ( @xmath82 ) and @xmath83 is the shock velocity . substituting @xmath843000  km  s@xmath8 @xcite , we obtain @xmath85  18@xmath81  kev .",
    "@xmath81 increases for h - deficient gas widely seen among stellar winds from evolved early - type stars such as @xmath0 car , and reaches 4/3 for the most extreme case that the gas is composed only of fully - ionized he .",
    "the thermal bremsstrahlung model was abandoned in the bepposax @xcite analysis and was unemployed in the integral analysis @xcite .",
    "the combined suzaku spectrum indicates @xmath86  35  kev , but given a large systematic uncertainty , we consider that this emission mechanism remains a viable explanation .",
    "second , we argue against the bremsstrahlung emission by accelerated charged particles colliding upon ambient cold matter .",
    "this process is proposed for the super - hard emission seen in solar and stellar flares @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 car has a rich ambient matter to brake the accelerated particles , which is evidenced by a large amount of circumstellar extinction and the presence of the fe fluorescence line @xcite .",
    "however , the x - ray yield of this process is very low of @xmath8710@xmath88 even for the most efficient bremsstrahlung by electrons of a 10  kev to 1  mev kinetic energy against a thick target .",
    "most of the kinetic energy is lost by the ionization of cold target .",
    "the measured luminosity is @xmath89  erg  s@xmath8 in the super - hard band for the two suzaku observations , which implies that a constant energy input is necessary at a rate of @xmath8710@xmath90  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "this is hardly possible given the total kinetic energy of the stellar wind in this cwb being @xmath510@xmath91  erg  s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the inverse compton emission of stellar uv photons by a non - thermal population of electrons scattering the ambient uv photons up to the super - hard band @xcite .",
    "this is the most popular explanation adopted in @xcite and @xcite , and our suzaku result agrees with this interpretation .",
    "several mechanisms of acceleration to produce the non - thermal population are proposed , which includes the first - order fermi acceleration at the shock , electric field acceleration in the current sheet in a magnetized wind @xcite , and magnetic reconnections .",
    "the x - ray photon index of @xmath51.4 indicates that the injected non - thermal electrons have an energy distribution with an index of @xmath52 or harder , depending on how the compton cooling balances the injected energy .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration predicts the value of 2 for the electron energy index , and some modifications may need to be considered @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge y. hyodo for his help in the xis data reduction , j. pittard for his comments on particle acceleration , and j. c. leyder and r. walter for providing the integral spectrum .",
    "we thank the suzaku science working group team for their effort in the initial phase of the operation , during which the present data set was obtained .",

    "<S> we found significant excess emission above the thermal emission in the super - hard band with the pin , confirming the previous integral isgri report . </S>",
    "<S> the entire 550  kev spectra were fitted by a combination of a thermal plasma model plus a flat power - law or a very hot thermal bremsstrahlung model for the excess emission . </S>",
    "<S> no significant change of the excess emission was found at different epochs within the systematic and statistical uncertainties and no flare - like flux amplification was seen in the hard band , indicating that the excess emission is a steady phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the super - hard emission is attributable to the inverse compton of stellar uv photons by non - thermal electrons or to the thermal bremsstrahlung of very hot plasma , and not to the bremsstrahlung by non - thermal electrons colliding with cold ambient matter . </S>"
