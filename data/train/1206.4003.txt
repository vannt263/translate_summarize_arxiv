    "newman black hole case is the subject of this paper .",
    "this is a case of particular importance due to this 4-@xmath10 black hole @xcite likely being astrophysically realized ( at least to very good approximation as a model and for very small values of the charge parameter ) .",
    "this is due to its relevant and not excessively high symmetry , uniqueness theorems leading to it , and its capacity to arise as the end - product of the evolution of somewhat more irregular configurations .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for previous work on the geometry of thermodynamic state spaces for 4-@xmath10 black holes . in the present paper , a mathematically superior coordinate system for the ruppeiner thermodynamical state space geometry for the kerr  newman black hole",

    "this is obtained via the following sequence of coordinate transformations .",
    "i take davies coordinates @xcite , apply mass - homogenization and then apply a new coordinate transformation ; i also present the overall composite transformation and consider limiting cases ( reissner  nordstrm , kerr , extremal ) .",
    "the coordinate system found is superior in particular by virtue of block - minimality .",
    "consequences of this include ( sec 4 ) 1 ) obtaining geometrical insights ( showing using my coordinate system that 1 of the 3 conformal killing vectors of the limiting cases thermodynamical state spaces survives the generalization to the kerr ",

    "the idea is then to blockwise - simplify this by applying coordinate transformations .",
    "i first use a transformation well - known to ruppeiner @xcite and which goes at least as far back as to davies @xcite : q : = q / m , j : = j / m^2 ; these are a particular case of dimensionless variables .",
    "i note that these then simplify the blockwise form of the thermodynamical ruppeiner metric as in fig 1b ) .",
    "i next apply a mass - homogenizing/@xmath6-dependence - freeing transformation : = m , so as to have a fully homogenized version of davies - type coordinates .",
    "this casts the metric in the form of fig 1c ) .",
    "finally , i obtain a further cross - term removing coordinate transformation alongside a simplification for the isolated @xmath11 block by solving a pair of differential equations , yielding the coordinate transformation : = ( j/ ) by which the metric is cast in the final blockwise - simplified form of fig 1d ) .",

    "* 1 ) limiting cases of physical interest * i ) @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath15 , i.e. the reissner  nordstrm black hole . for this case ,",
    "the ruppeiner geometry is flat , so it can not encode this case s phase transition .",
    "this is a well - known limitation on the ruppeiner thermodynamical geometry being an entire account of phase transitions .",
    "some suggestions as regards how to include this case are i ) to exclude the static electric energy @xcite .",
    "ii ) this exclusion is an example of legendre transformation , a type of transformation familiar from basic thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , a case can be made for adopting thermodynamic state space metrics that are invariant under legendre transformations @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that thermodynamical state space metrics remain an unfinished subject .",
    "\\iii ) the extremal values @xmath19 of @xmath20 ( see fig 2 ) correspond to @xmath21 , i.e. the extremal kerr  newman black hole . here , this paper s coordinate system breaks down ; moreover the thermodynamic state space in this case comes out straightforwardly in @xmath22 , @xmath23 coordinates as flat ( @xmath17 minkowski metric ) , so this case is easily elsewise covered .        *",
    "2 ) note on the general value of block - minimality*. block - minimality is a weakening of the concept of diagonality for cases in which diagonality itself can not be attained ; this paper s working does not extend to a removal of the last independent off - diagonal term .",
    "well - known examples of non - diagonalizable metrics and useful block - minimal forms are as follows .",

    "pope coordinates @xcite are block - minimal and subsequently serve e.g. as useful cyclic coordinates for dynamics on @xmath24 , in the analysis of conserved quantities on this space and in separating the schrdinger equation on this space @xcite and for a number of gravitational instanton applications .",
    "\\2 ) the most general bianchi ix anisotropic models are non - diagonal ; these are of value in modelling both dynamics ( some of the more general cases of dynamical systems behaviour in @xcite ) and singularities ( e.g. the bkl conjecture @xcite ) in cosmology .",
    "\\4 ) for the legendre transformation invariant thermodynamical state space geometry of @xcite in the kerr ",
    "newman case also , the metric is also non - diagonal with a block - minimal form provided .",
    "moreover , this metric s block - minimal form is distinct from ours via its sole nonzero off - diagonal term being ` @xmath25 ' rather than ` @xmath26 ' .",
    "this distinction means that 4 ) s block minimality aligns with the @xmath27 factorization of ( [ in - ent ] ) so that the hessian of @xmath28 itself enters the expression for this metric .",
    "\\a ) study of conformal killing vectors ( ckv s ) .",
    "each of the reissner ",
    "nordstrm and kerr black hole thermodynamic state spaces have 3 ckv s by conformal flatness . in the generalization to kerr  newman black hole thermodynamical state space ,",
    "at least one ckv survives : @xmath29 .",
    "the homogenizing transformation that unveiled this here does have a counterpart in the case of the simpler kerr black hole thermodynamical state space itself .",
    "however , this kind of transformation was not arrived at in this case , probably because it is apparent in this case by other means that the ruppeiner thermodynamical state space geometry is conformally flatness , by which one trivially obtains the ckv s in this case .",
    "this triviality also occurs for the reissner ",
    "nordstrm black hole s ruppeiner thermodynamic state space .",
    "the value of finding ckv s is additionally increased by these being shared by the weinhold thermodynamical geometry @xcite since this is conformally related to the ruppeiner one .",
    "b ) mathematical characterization of the geometry involved .",
    "it is not clear at first sight whether a geometry found in some physical application is already known in mathematics or in other areas of physics .",
    "this is because of coordinate dependence of line elements , and makes e.g. deciding whether one s endeavours have resulted in one finding a 4-metric that is a new solution to einstein s equations is a nontrivial process @xcite .",
    "one has to consider a number of coordinate - invariant features of the geometry in order to determine this .",
    "the situation of geometrical characterization is similar in the case of 3-metrics such as the present paper s , which moreover arises in an interesting physical context as a thermodynamic state space for the most basic , very fundamental and most likely to be astrophysically realized family of black holes .",
    "knowledge of the number and algebraic inter - relations between the ( conformal ) killing vectors is useful in this direction , as is the computation of the full set of curvature invariants @xcite .",
    "the present paper s coordinate system not only readily sheds some information about the former ( i do not recognise this geometry as occuring elsewhere in the mathematical or physical literature , but i have uncovered that it manifests at least a moderate amount of symmetry in the form of it possessing a conformal killing vector ) .",
    "it also considerably simplifies the computation of the latter through starting with the least number of nonzero metric components .",
    "* acknowledgements*. i thank ingemar bengtsson for pointing out the alignment in point 2.4 of the discussion , albeit in the context that my blockwise minimal expression for the ruppeiner thermodynamic state space metric for the kerr ",
    "newman black hole did not possess it .",
    "it was down to me to point out that , on the other hand the legendre transformation invariant thermodynamic state space metric for the kerr  newman black hole _ does _",
    "possess this alignment , which could be helpful in the study of this other state space metric metric .",
