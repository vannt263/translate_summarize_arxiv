    "predicting the integrated spectral energy distributions of stellar populations is important in the solution of many problems in astronomy , from determining the ages of globular clusters to modeling counts of faint galaxies at high redshift . beginning with the early work of @xcite , successive generations of modelers",
    "have combined the best available data on stellar structure and evolution to predict the appearance of the combined light of generations of stars .",
    "although the subject of population synthesis has a long history , it is an active area of research : synthesis techniques and many of the input data ( isochrones , opacities , spectral libraries ) continue to be improved",
    ".    there is good evidence that globular clusters ( gcs ) are internally homogeneous in age and metallicity @xcite .",
    "gcs are the best observational analogs of modelers ` simple stellar populations ' , i.e.  populations of stars formed over a short time out of gas with homogeneous chemical composition .",
    "broadband colors are among the simplest predictions of population synthesis models , so comparing the models predicted colors to cluster colors is the natural zeroth - order test of compatibility between the models and reality @xcite . in this paper",
    "we compare the broad - band @xmath0 colors predicted by three modern population synthesis models with the colors of galactic and m31 gcs .",
    "our observational database is the first one to include extensive coverage of the @xmath5 bandpasses , and the first with spectroscopic metallicities for all clusters .",
    "we use the cluster metallicities to bin the clusters for comparison to the appropriate models . in this way",
    "we determine the cluster - to - model offset separately for each color and avoid the ambiguity in comparing model and cluster colors in two - color diagrams .",
    "for m31 clusters , the observational data are from the @xcite catalog . for the galactic clusters we obtained optical colors , metallicity , and reddening from the june 1999 version of the @xcite catalog , and ir colors from @xcite , as reported in @xcite ( but with the reddening correction applied by @xcite removed and the reddening values in @xcite used instead ) .",
    "we dereddened the clusters colors using the values of @xmath6 given in the catalogs and the @xcite extinction curve for @xmath7 . for m31",
    ", we excluded clusters where the error in the spectroscopic metallicity was @xmath8}>0.5 $ ] , and clusters suspected of being young on the basis of strong balmer absorption or blue  colors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for both galaxies , we excluded clusters with @xmath9 ; there are 103 m31 and 85 galactic clusters in the final sample .",
    "photometric data is not available in all bandpasses for all clusters : only about two - thirds have measured @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and less than half have @xmath12 .",
    "we compare the cluster colors to those for simple stellar populations of ages 8 , 12 , and 16 gyr from three sets of models : those of worthey}<-1.0 $ ] .",
    "] , bruzual and charlot ( hereafter bc ) ( both the worthey and bc models are reported in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite ( hereafter kff ) .",
    "although model colors are tabulated in smaller age increments ( typically 1 gyr ) , initially it is more reasonable to use the models as a rough guide to relative ages rather than attempting to derive precise cluster ages from them .",
    "the worthey models are computed at [ fe / h ] values of @xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16 , and @xmath17 dex , and the bc and kff models are computed at [ fe / h ] values of @xmath18 ( kff models only ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 dex .",
    "we compared clusters to both the salpeter imf ( worthey s ` vanilla ' models ) and @xcite ( * ? ? ? * in the worthey models ) imf version of the models .",
    "@xcite finds that some of his model colors have defects ( e.g.  is too red by 0.04 - 0.06@xmath22 due to problems in the theoretical stellar atmospheres and the color - temperature calibration ) , but the sizes of these defects are not well - determined so we do not correct for them .",
    "figure  [ twocolor ] shows data and models in two frequently - used two - color diagrams .",
    "since the models are computed at discrete values of [ fe / h ] , we use the spectroscopic metallicities of the clusters to compare only clusters with comparable metallicities ( @xmath23  dex ) to each model .",
    "the galactic cluster metallicities given in @xcite are on the @xcite ( zw ) metallicity scale , and the m31 cluster metallicities are also tied to this scale through the calibration of @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite suggests that the zw scale may be non - linear at both high and low metallicities .",
    "we retain the zw scale in this paper because we found that using the @xcite scale to assign clusters to model comparison bins made little difference in our results .",
    "we caution , however , that the effect of changing the metallicity scale is unknown for the @xmath4}=-0.25 $ ] model bin .",
    "the transformation from the zw to cg scales is only defined for @xmath4_{zw}}<-0.5 $ ] , the lower limit of this metallicity bin .",
    "we calculated the mean offsets between model and cluster colors ( referenced to @xmath24 ) for each metallicity bin ; figures  [ salp - zwscale][scal - zwscale ] show some representative comparisons .",
    "we plot @xmath25 for all bandpasses @xmath26 to make clear the differences in spectral energy distributions between models and data ; we remind the reader that the offsets for bandpasses redward of @xmath24 thus have the opposite sign from the usual colors .",
    "one general characteristic of the models visible in the figures is that younger - aged models predict bluer colors .",
    "the exception is the kff scalo model for @xmath4}=-1.63 $ ] , which predicts only very small color differences ( @xmath27 ) between ages of 12 and 16  gyr .",
    "the effect of the imf on the colors appears to depend on both metallicity and age . for the worthey @xmath28}=-1.50 $ ] models , miller - scalo imf colors are redder than salpeter model colors at all ages , but for the @xmath28}=-0.50 $ ] models , the miller - scalo imf colors are bluer for 8 and 12  gyr and almost identical for 16 gyr .",
    "bc predict almost no color difference between the salpeter and scalo imf models of the same age and metallicity .",
    "a striking feature in figures  [ salp - zwscale ] and  [ scal - zwscale ] is the range of discrepancies between models and data .",
    "for example , the largest difference between the worthey model with parameters ( salpeter imf , @xmath28}=-1.50 $ ] , age 16  gyr ) and the mean colors of clusters with @xmath29}\\leq-1.25 $ ] is @xmath30 in . the same models with",
    "@xmath28}=-0.50 $ ] are well offset from the data at all colors except ; the largest offset is @xmath31 in . to determine the best - fitting models",
    ", we quantify the overall goodness - of - fit for each model / cluster metallicity bin pair as : @xmath32 the color differences @xmath33 are weighted by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are the standard errors in the mean colors of objects in the bin .",
    "table  [ bestfit ] gives the @xmath36 and @xmath37 values for the best fitting models in each metallicity bin .",
    "table  [ bestfit ] shows that the best - fitting models fit the data quite well , with typical color offsets of @xmath38 .",
    "the two bandpasses with the most significant offsets are @xmath2 and @xmath3 : the models are too blue in  and too red in .",
    "neither offset shows a clear trend with metallicity .",
    "the offsets are likely not due to systematics in the photometric system or in the extinction curve . while problems with the photometric systems might be expected in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands ( due to conversion between the johnson and cousins @xmath39 systems ) , both data and models use the well - defined johnson  system .",
    "problems in the reddening curve also seem unlikely for the same reasons .",
    "we suspect that the offsets are more likely due to systematic errors in the models .",
    "the  offset in particular is likely due to the flux libraries used .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found their model  colors to be @xmath40 too red compared to empirical solar - metallicity spectra , even after correcting to the empirical color - temperature scale .",
    "this suggests a possible problem with the stellar atmosphere models of @xcite , upon which both libraries are based .",
    "the cause of the offset in  is not as clear .",
    "this offset is actually worse than it appears : since we compute the  colors for the bc and kff models as @xmath41 , the red  colors _ compensate _ for some of the  defect , which is actually larger than the defect in .",
    "whose models give  directly  finds that his model  is too blue compared to solar neighborhood stars and elliptical galaxies .",
    "worthey cites problems with the @xmath2 fluxes from the stellar libraries as a possible cause : modeling the many blended atomic and molecular lines blueward of @xmath3 is difficult , and many of the necessary opacities are not well determined .",
    "this can not be the only cause of model problems in @xmath2 , since the bc and kff models , which use the same stellar library , predict different  colors .",
    "the treatment of the horizontal branch in the models is another possible source of problems in the  colors because the hb emits most of the blue light .",
    "however , systematic problems with the model hb color ( which depends on metallicity ) , would presumably produce a  offset dependent on metallicity , which we do not observe .",
    "observational error is another possible contributor to the  offset , as many of the  colors of the m31 clusters are poorly determined ( see table 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the rest - frame @xmath2 flux of stellar populations becomes increasingly important when studying high - redshift galaxies and global star formation history , and further investigation of the models in this bandpass is clearly warranted .",
    "a secondary result in table  [ bestfit ] is that age determines which model best fits the data .",
    "higher - metallicity cluster colors are best fit by 8 gyr models , regardless of imf . lower - metallicity cluster colors",
    "( @xmath4_{bin}}\\leq-1.00 $ ] ) are best fit by 12 or 16 gyr models .",
    "the best - fit age depends on the imf for several of the models , but not in any systematic fashion .",
    "this result is consistent with the determinations of relative ages for galactic clusters by @xcite .",
    "these authors determined relative ages of 35 galactic globular clusters from a homogeneous set of @xmath24 ,  color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "they compared theoretical isochrones with the observational cmds to determine ages using two independent methods .",
    "they found that the clusters with @xmath4_{cg}}>-0.9 $ ] were @xmath42% younger than clusters with @xmath4_{cg}}<-1.2 $ ] , with the intermediate - metallicity clusters showing a @xmath43% age dispersion .",
    "these results are model - dependent , as are ours , but the results similarity implies that either there is a real difference between metal - rich and metal - poor clusters or there is a systematic problem in the models in one of the metallicity regimes .",
    "what possible systematic errors in our input data or comparison procedure could produce the result that the metal - rich clusters are younger ?",
    "we redid the comparison procedure considering the clusters of each galaxy separately , and still found younger ages for the most metal - rich clusters . although m31 has a greater proportion of the metal - rich clusters , younger ages are found for both m31 and galactic metal - rich clusters .",
    "@xcite suggest that the spectroscopic metallicities of the most metal - rich m31 clusters measured by @xcite are systematically too high .",
    "if this is true , the clusters would appear too blue compared to old , higher - metallicity models and the best - fit model would be younger .",
    "we compared the metal - rich m31 clusters to the worthey @xmath4}=-1.0 $ ] models , and the best - fitting model had age 16  gyr .",
    "however , the goodness - of - fit was better for the young , metal - rich models than for the older , more metal - poor model , so we conclude that younger ages are still favored for these clusters . overestimating the reddening of the metal - rich clusters would make the derived intrinsic colors too blue and yield younger ages .",
    "this seems unlikely , given that the color - metallicity relations for galactic and m31 clusters match well throughout their metallicity range ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the methods of reddening determination for m31 and galactic clusters are different",
    ".    if the detection of younger ages for metal - rich globular clusters is real , it has implications for galaxy formation .",
    "a range of gc ages implies that gc formation took place over an extended period of time .",
    "conditions for gc formation were not particular to the early universe , an assertion supported by observations of ` proto - globular ' clusters in present - day merging galaxies ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more precise knowledge of the distribution of cluster ages in each galaxy would be extremely useful in understanding cluster system formation .",
    "if the age distribution is continuous , the relation between age and metallicity might hold clues as to what factors controlled the cluster formation rate . if the age distribution is bimodal  with most clusters old and coeval and the remainder younger and coeval",
    " then some event must have triggered the second episode of gc formation .",
    "perhaps the younger clusters were stripped from or accreted along with satellite galaxies of m31 and the galaxy .",
    "comparison of three sets of population synthesis models with integrated colors of m31 and galactic globular clusters shows that the models reproduce the redder average cluster colors to within the observational uncertainties .",
    "the poorer agreement in  and  is likely due to systematic errors in the models .",
    "younger - age models are required to best match the colors of the metal - rich clusters , consistent with the findings of @xcite that the most metal - rich galactic clusters are younger than the bulk of the globular cluster population .",
    "a range of ages for globular clusters implies that conditions for cluster formation were not restricted to the early universe .",
    "the cluster age distribution has important implications for galaxy and globular cluster system formation , and attempts to determine it more precisely are needed .                                                     vs. @xmath44 and @xmath45 for m31 globular clusters ( triangles ) and galactic gcs ( squares ) .",
