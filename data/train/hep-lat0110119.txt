    "finite size scaling ( fss ) is a very powerful tool , particularly useful in extracting numerical estimates from monte carlo simulations .",
    "numerical simulations give results on systems of finite size , where phase transitions can not occur .",
    "thus , a fundamental task in monte carlo studies of phase transitions is the extraction of results holding in the thermodynamic limit from data obtained in systems of finite size .",
    "fss describes how a system of finite size approaches criticality in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one of its most far  reaching aspects concerns the universality of the fss functions .",
    "if universality holds , complex systems share the same critical behaviour as simpler systems .",
    "this opens the possibility to use simple models to obtain accurate information on much more complicated theories .",
    "+ in a recent paper@xcite , a study of the fss of spatial t  hooft loops of maximal size across the deconfinement phase transition has been performed in the @xmath2 yang  mills theory . by this analysis ,",
    "a numerical estimate of the dual string tension - for the first time observed in @xcite - has been obtained .",
    "moreover , also the fss of the electric free energies of the theory has been investigated .",
    "+ according to the svetitsky ",
    "yaffe conjecture@xcite , the @xmath1 @xmath2 yang  mills theory at the deconfinement transition is believed to be in the same universality class as the @xmath0 ising model at the hot / cold phase transition .",
    "several numerical studies have confirmed the validity of this conjecture .",
    "thus , also the universal fss functions of the electric and magnetic free energies of the @xmath1 @xmath2 theory measured in @xcite , should match with fss functions observable in the @xmath0 ising model .",
    "we investigate the universality of the fss functions in the @xmath0 ising model at the hot / cold phase transition .",
    "in particular we focus on the fss of interface free energies .",
    "our aim is to compare fss functions measured in the ising model with those observed in @xmath2 for the magnetic and the electric free energies . in order to set this connection ,",
    "it is useful to recall the idea behind the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture for the case we are considering now .",
    "if we could integrate the degrees of freedom of the @xmath1 @xmath2 gauge theory to write an effective action for the polyakov loop @xmath3 , this effective action would be a @xmath0 spin system with symmetry @xmath4 .",
    "then svetitsky and yaffe give arguments according to which the ( complicated ) effective action for the polyakov loop reduces - close to criticality - to the nearest ",
    "neighbour ising interaction .",
    "if we now consider an @xmath2 yang  mills theory on the lattice , a spatial t  hooft loop in the @xmath5 plane can be obtained by inverting the sign of the coupling of a set of time ",
    "like @xmath6 plaquettes . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the extension of the system in direction @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the unit vector along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "this condition can be accomplished in the effective ising model for the polyakov loop , by changing the boundary conditions from periodic ( p.b.c . ) to antiperiodic ( a.p.b.c . ) in direction @xmath9 .",
    "this generates a frustration in the spin system , which , in the cold phase , creates a surface of defects .",
    "one can set a.p.b.c .",
    "in one , two or in all three directions . in the @xmath2 theory , this corresponds to switching on 1 , 2 or 3 orthogonal spatial t  hooft loops of maximal size .",
    "we study the @xmath0 ising model on a cubic lattice of size @xmath11 , with the usual ferromagnetic nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the spin at the lattice site @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the unit vector in direction @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the coupling .",
    "the data presented in this paper have been collected on lattices of size up to @xmath18 .",
    "more details about the simulation parameters will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we consider p.b.c . and a.p.b.c .",
    "in @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions .",
    "@xmath22 , with respectively @xmath23 are the partition functions for these 4 different choices .",
    "the observable we consider is the free energy cost @xmath24 to create such interfaces .",
    "it is given by [ magsec ] f_k ( i ) - i=1,2,3 the counterparts of the electric free energies of the @xmath2 theory are obtained by performing the @xmath4 fourier transform @xcite in ( [ magsec ] ) . in terms of the @xmath22 ,",
    "their expressions are @xmath25 where @xmath26 . the correlation length @xmath27 sets the scale of the distances .",
    "it has a critical behaviour with exponent @xmath28 : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "we express the fss functions in terms of the scaling variable @xmath31 . in figure  1",
    ", we compare the fss functions of @xmath32 between the ising model and @xmath2 .",
    "we show results both in the cold / deconfined phase ( @xmath33 ) and the hot / confined one ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "on one hand , we observe that , according to fss expectations , the data collected at various values of @xmath8 and @xmath35 lie on a single curve , depending only on @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "it turns out to agree excellently with the fss function of one spatial t  hooft loop in @xmath2 .",
    "note that the scaling functions for @xmath2 and the ising model do not directly match from the raw data .",
    "a rescaling of the correlation length by a factor @xmath37 is necessary : @xmath38 .",
    "this implies that the variable @xmath36 defined for the ising model and the one used in @xmath2 @xcite are related by : @xmath39 .",
    "we have estimated the value @xmath40 by rescaling the @xmath33 ising data in such a way that they overlap with the @xmath2 ones .",
    "we stress that , once @xmath37 has been estimated , its value remains fixed and it is no more a fitting parameter . in figures 2 and 3",
    "the @xmath36 variable for the @xmath2 data has been rescaled by @xmath37 .      in figure 2 , we display the comparison ising@xmath2 for @xmath24 @xmath41 at @xmath33 .",
    "the interface tension @xmath42 is a fitting parameter only for @xmath32 : we estimate the value @xmath43 . for a full comparison ,",
    "we have used the same fitting ansatz as in @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with  but more precise than  the value measured in @xcite . for @xmath24 @xmath44 ,",
    "we have set @xmath45 , as follows from the expectations of the minimal interface area .",
    "this hypothesis is well satisfied , as apparent from the good quality of the fits .",
    "the very good matching ising@xmath2 of the fss functions for the free energy interface holds also for the cases of a.p.b.c . in 2 and 3 directions .",
    "figure  3 concerns the fss for @xmath46 ; similar results hold for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "thus , also for the electric free energies , we observe very good agreement between the fss functions of the two theories , with much increased accuracy in the ising case .",
    "finally , we have measured the product @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the correlation length in the hot phase . at large @xmath36 and",
    "close to the critical point , the fss functions of @xmath32 and @xmath46 have the simple asymptotic forms : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are two constants . then at large @xmath55",
    ", we have @xmath56 .",
    "in order for this ratio to reach its asymptotic behaviour sooner , we have subtracted a constant @xmath57 to the interface free energy @xmath32 . in figure  4 we plot",
    "@xmath58 as function of @xmath55 .",
    "the data clearly show a flattening to a constant at large @xmath55 . fitting the last 5 points to the right with a constant , we obtain @xmath59 . extended discussions and details about the shown results will be presented in a forthcoming paper .        _",
