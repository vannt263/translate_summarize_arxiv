    "most of the light - curve analyses of contact binary stars of the w  uma type assume  following the seminal papers of @xcite  that shapes of these stars are well described by a common equipotential surface of the roche model . however , light curve analyses have a common limitation : a light curve is a result of a mapping of a complex three - dimensional surface into an one - dimensional function of time .",
    "the information content of many contact binary light curves is low , particularly when total eclipses do not occur .",
    "the correctness of the assumed model is of a crucial importance for a proper interpretation of these binaries and still remains an open issue .",
    "the exact solid - body rotation of the roche model is a strong assumption of the lucy model .",
    "while it is a convenient simplification of the problem , we have no theoretical basis to believe that a strictly solid - body rotation is really present .",
    "the sun does not rotate rigidly and there are many indications that other solar type stars also rotate differentially .",
    "we have rather vague ideas for rotation rates some hundred times than the solar .",
    "simple arguments based on the presence of horizontal temperature gradients could be used to argue that convection cells should break into small ones leading to an enhanced turbulent viscosity and thus a solid - body rotation . but  on the other hand  the large difference in the component nuclear energy production requires an effective transport over common envelope which can not happen without extensive horizontal motions .",
    "also , the degree of the solid - body rotation may depend on the mass of the secondary component ; when it is very small , its tidal influence may be too weak to prevent the big primary from rotating differentially .    within the roche model ,",
    "a common equipotential surface has a relatively simple shape and is described by only three free geometrical parameters ( the mass ratio , @xmath2 , the degree of contact , @xmath3 and the inclination , @xmath4 ) ; this parametric description is even simpler than for detached binaries where sizes of components are unrelated .",
    "all extant solutions of contact binary light curves still require a proof of the strict applicability of the roche model described in such simple terms .",
    "in this paper we attempt to lift the degeneracy of the 3d into 1d light - curve mapping by using the broadening functions formalism @xcite . a broadening function ( bf )",
    "gives the surface brightness distribution of a stellar object in the velocity space .",
    "this is true if all surface points radiate the same spectrum , which appears to be a particularly valid assumption for contact binaries ( see @xcite ) . in the case of a solid body rotation ,",
    "the observed radial velocity is proportional to the projected distance from the axis of rotation .",
    "when combined with the uniform surface brightness , a single bf gives a 1d image of system in the velocity space .",
    "we go one step further and analyze several bf s by arranging and combining them in the orbital phase into 2d functions ( radial velocity , orbital phase ) , effectively the phase dependent , 2d radial - velocity maps of a binary system .",
    "the approach of arranging spectra in the phase domain , when the phase coherence is an issue , has already been used by several researches , particularly to study rapid changes in cataclysmic variables . in the ddo studies of the binary stars ,",
    "it was used mostly as an auxiliary tool @xcite for faint binaries where individual bf s were poor and some phase averaging was advantageous . but here , it is used as the main way to assess correctness of the solid - body rotation and to analyze the well observed contact binary aw  uma .",
    "the main object of our study , aw  uma , is presented in section  [ obj ] .",
    "the observations are described in section  [ obs ] while the determination of radial velocities through a gaussian and rotational profile fitting and through direct modelling of the bfs is presented in section  [ velocities ] .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic elements and the absolute parameters are presented in section  [ elements ] .",
    "sections  [ mass - ratio ] and [ deviate ] discuss the critical issue of the applicability of the roche model and of the deviations from it that we have discovered . a new model of aw  uma is presented and discussed in section  [ newmodel ] .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ sum ] . throughout the paper v566",
    "oph is discussed as a comparison object for aw  uma ; this contact binary was previously analyzed in @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of aw  uma by @xcite and after the important demonstration by @xcite that its photometric variability beautifully agrees with the then recently developed contact model of @xcite  this being true in spite of its unexpectedly small value of the photometrically derived mass ratio @xmath5  the binary has played a special role in the field of contact binaries .",
    "its very small photometric mass ratio was re - confirmed several times ( for references to observational studies , see @xcite ) . throughout the development of the field , all theoretical studies had to include this object as a crucial if extreme datum in all structural and evolutionary modelling efforts .",
    "the key point was that even at this extreme mass ratio , with the almost totally energetically inert secondary component , the surface temperature can be equalized over the whole common envelope as described by an equipotential surface of the roche model .",
    "the particularly good characterization of the light curve and the seemingly unambiguous conclusion that @xmath5 were a direct result of the presence of total eclipses strongly constraining the parameter space of the contact model solutions . while the photometric observations leave very little room for questioning the low value of @xmath2 for aw  uma  as long as it really fulfils all conditions of the lucy model ",
    "spectroscopic data were less easy to interpret .",
    "this is because the spectral lines of the primary component are broad and show a very small and difficult to measure orbital variability with the semi - amplitude of the variation , @xmath6 , which is _ several times smaller _ than the rotational broadening of its lines .",
    "the spectral signature of the secondary component , while nowadays rather easily detectable , is weak indicating @xmath7 in the visual region . as the result",
    ", the spectroscopic elements of aw  uma remain virtually undetermined in spite of several previous attempts .",
    ".properties of aw  uma and v566  oph .",
    "[ tab01 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     turning to the spectroscopic determinations of @xmath8 : their main uncertainty is in the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the primary component , @xmath6 , in @xmath9 , particularly when @xmath10 .",
    "this results from @xmath11 where , for small @xmath2 , the second term becomes irrelevant even when radial velocities of the secondary component are less accurate of the two ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the masses and luminosities of the components , as given in table  [ tab04 ] , are consistent with this prediction .",
    "we clearly see several deviations from the strict roche model predictions in our analysis of the bfs for aw  uma . they are documented in the bf residual maps , fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] .",
    "the deviations are discussed mostly on the basis of our new spectroscopic material , but  to be sure of the consistency in our assumptions ",
    "we made also parallel analyzes of the extant light curves of aw  uma utilizing the material and approaches as in @xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we will use the term `` the primary ( secondary ) component '' to describe the appearance of the respective stars in the broadening functions ; this would be in place of the correct , but long expressions such as `` the primary ( secondary ) component signature as seen in the radial velocities '' .",
    "the primary component is too narrow and looks `` triangular''_. the central parts of the primary component are systematically too narrow than predicted by the contact model .",
    "the peaked shape of the primary bf is the reason why it could not be fitted by the normal limb darkening law and required @xmath13 ( sections  [ differential ] and [ direct ] ) . a strongly differential rotation following",
    "the solar paradigm does not help much in alleviating this problem ( solution # 3 in table [ tab04 ] ) because the shape remains incorrect ; particularly the `` kink '' at  1/3 height ( see the next item ) is then even more prominent in the fit residuals .",
    "an explanation by a very strong limb darkening does not have any good basis .",
    "the limb darkening effect is a strictly local atmospheric phenomenon ; it is very hard to force it to be larger because this would require an increase in the local gradient of the source function .",
    "if anything , the source function can be easily made flatter ( for example due to local kinetic dissipation of horizontal motions or to magnetic energy deposition ) so the limb darkening could be smaller than for normal , spherical stars rather than larger .    an explanation by the differential rotation would force us to reject the roche model which is based on the solid - body rotation law . application of a consistent , differentially rotating equivalent of the roche model is beyond the scope of this study , mainly because of the formidable theoretical obstacles how to treat the star shape and brightness distribution for such a case . in this paper , we use a hybrid model by retaining the roche model for the shape and for the brightness prediction while artificially imposing a non - solid body rotation law for velocities , but we stress that such a model is not internally consistent . we note that an introduction of a differential rotation characterized by the parameter @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ eqn01 ] was not fully satisfactory and the quality of the fits was inferior compared to assumption of a large limb darkening . moreover",
    ", an explanation by a strong differential rotation or some steady surface circulation patterns @xcite would require very rapid flows and strong velocity shear which  in turn  would cause shock waves in the photosphere , as argued by @xcite .",
    "the `` triangular '' shape of the primary is not seen by us for the first time .",
    "@xcite and later @xcite appeared to see the same type of deviations .",
    "synthesized spectra of aw  uma , including changes of local profile over the surface , by @xcite showed that the variations of the surface temperature over the surface of the contact binary certainly can not cause the peculiarity in the profile shape .",
    "_ the primary component shows a wide `` base '' or a large rotational - velocity `` pedestal''_. there exists an additional broadening at the base of the primary , reaching about 1/3 of its height above the baseline .",
    "it is enhanced by the pointed ( triangular ) shape of primary main peak .",
    "it does not have an obvious explanation , but it may be due to an equatorially distributed , hot matter , encompassing the whole system and possibly including the secondary within its extent . due to the orbital inclination of aw  uma of only about 78@xmath15 , an equatorial belt should be visible through most of the orbital revolution , although at this point we can not say much about its geometry .",
    "if the luminous matter is really there , its additional light in the system could explain the smaller than predicted ( for @xmath16 ) amplitude of the observed light curves of aw  uma ( see item # 5 below ) .",
    "however , the amount of light would have to be large ( @xmath17 ) to drive the photometric mass ratio from @xmath18 to the popular value of the photometric mass ratio of @xmath19 .",
    "the secondary component changes its shape with phase . _",
    "the secondary appears to be too small during the transit phases as if it was not a full , roche filling star , but only a much smaller core .",
    "its two sides ( limb darkened edges ) are of unequal depths during the transit with the negative - velocity definitely darker .",
    "in addition , the secondary looks differently in the two orbital quadratures : it shows a faintly marked extension towards the primary at phases close to 0.25 while it appears to have a double structure ( as if this star was itself a double or contained a rotating ring ) at phases around 0.75 .",
    "this is best visible in a comparison of the two orbital quadratures ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the shape of the secondary appears to vary in time scales of perhaps weeks while the primary component remains remarkably stable in time .",
    "this variability is particularly well visible among spectra taken around phase 0.64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] ) . ] .",
    "the orbital changes of the secondary component and particularly its small dimensions when projected against the primary may be interpreted in two ways : ( i )  either the secondary underfills its roche lobe or ( ii )  what we see as a secondary is really an accretion region around a compact core .",
    "the small dimensions of the secondary would be consistent with the discrepancy between @xmath8 and @xmath20 , when the latter is determined through the phase of the inner eclipse contact .",
    "_ the secondary component is too faint and/or has a too low temperature . _",
    "the secondary component is too faint in the bf s as if the secondary was cooler than predicted .",
    "the required temperature to fit the secondary at quadratures would require a large temperature difference of components : for the assumed @xmath21 = 7,000 k , it demands @xmath22 k. this is incompatible with observed light curves which show practically the same depth of minima .",
    "for instance @xcite assuming @xmath23 k derived a similar @xmath24 k.    the assumption of low @xmath25 helps to fit the secondary profiles around quadratures , but predicts a relatively deep cut into the profile of the primary component during its transit in front of the primary .",
    "this is not observed and the trough or depression during the transit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) is very shallow , as if the temperature difference was in fact absent .",
    "we suspect that this problem is not intrinsic to the star but may be due to difficulties with normalization of the aw  uma spectra prior to determination of broadening functions .",
    "similarly as for other very close binaries , the spectra are notoriously difficult to handle in terms of an appropriate choice of the continuum level .",
    "this is because spectral lines in strongly rotationally broadened late - type spectra are heavily blended forcing one to define the local continuum relative to a basically arbitrary level between the lines .",
    "the importance of this effect can be illustrated by a simple experiment : we convolved the template spectrum with the expected contribution of each of the components of aw  uma at one of the orbital quadratures ( phase 0.25 ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig08 ] where we see directly that the real continuum is entirely unknown .",
    "one must use a pseudo - continuum level with an uncertainty of at least 1%  2% .",
    "extensive tests of the bf technique have shown that shapes of the bfs are entirely unaffected by the uncertainty in the continuum level placement , but that the bf zero level may be shifted , usually to negative values ( because the continuum is usually placed too low ) .",
    "the property of such simple shifts , without any influence on the shape , are due to the linear characteristics of the broadening functions and are a great advantage over the cross - correlation functions ( where zero levels are usually not accessible at all ) . but the uncertainty of the zero level does influence integrated intensities of the two stellar peaks .",
    "it has practically negligible influence on the strength of the primary component in the bf , but  for a very small mass ratio  has a profound effect on the definition of the secondary peak as small differences in the zero level strongly influence its integrated strength .",
    "the effect is exactly in the direction of making the secondary too faint hence under - luminous relative to the model .",
    "_ there is an inconsistency in the amount of light in the system . _",
    "it is impossible to fit the observed light curves of aw  uma with the parameters derived from the radial - velocity ( bf ) orbital solutions .",
    "the major obstacle is the predicted difference of the eclipse depths , @xmath26 mag , caused by different temperatures of components , which is not observed .",
    "the larger mass ratio , @xmath18 rather than 0.075 , forces both minima to be deeper than observed .",
    "all previous photometric solutions were fully consistent with the smaller mass ratio and there was no contradiction between the elements .",
    "as already mentioned , this can be alleviated by the presence of an unaccounted third light in the system of about @xmath27 . except for indications of a luminous equatorial belt ( item # 2 above ) , we see no other possible light contribution .",
    "a decrease of the orbital inclination to solve the problem is out of the question because the light curve clearly shows total eclipses .",
    "we should stress , however , that our main conclusion concerning the mass ratio of @xmath18 is based solely on the radial velocity data and in no way is it related to the light amount budget evaluated from the eclipse depths .",
    "the primary component is spotted . _",
    "the outer ( away from the secondary ) parts of the primary component reveal presence of unexplained dark features which run diagonally in the phase  radial velocity 2-d diagram in figure  [ fig01 ] and can be interpreted as dark spots on a solid - body rotating primary .",
    "they are better visible in the picture of the residuals in figure  [ fig05 ] .",
    "their presence across the whole width of the primary component indicates that they must span the whole range of velocities , i.e. , must be located close to the equator of the primary .",
    "they also contradict our suspicions of a differential rotation of the primary because they were apparently stabile over the whole period of one year .",
    "obviously , we have no idea what is the origin of the features that we see ; if these are magnetic spots , this would suggest a convective envelope which would be unexpected for the relatively early spectral type of aw  uma .",
    "we may note however that simple stellar - structure arguments suggest that the primary should have a relatively deep convective envelope @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the bf deviations from the roche model  as seen in radial velocity maps  are definitely present and very well defined for aw  uma , but are absent in v566  oph ( see for example fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] ) .",
    "it seems that v566  oph behaves fully according to the model and that it is aw  uma which appears to be in some way peculiar .",
    "this is all strange and unexpected , mostly because of the excellent agreement of the aw  uma light curve with the model .",
    "the two binaries have very similar spectral types and orbital periods , and differ really only in their mass ratios , @xmath28 for aw  uma versus @xmath29 for v566  oph .",
    "is this what causes the great difference between the systems and the strong deviations for aw  uma ?",
    "as described in the previous section , the secondary component of aw  uma , as seen in radial velocities , is far from what we would expect on the basis of the contact lucy model .",
    "because the secondary is faint and dominated by the much bigger and brighter primary companion , it is very hard to study , but its signature is definitely very different from that expected within the contact model .",
    "but the well observed primary is also showing major deviations from the contact model .",
    "we are absolutely sure now that ( 1 )  the span of the primary rotational velocities is much less than expected for the contact model and that ( 2 )  there is some additional source of continuum light at large rotational velocities relative to the primary centre ( we call it `` the belt '' ) .",
    "the problem ( 1 )  forced us to consider  as solutions  the unusually large limb darkening and the differential rotation field . but both are hard to accept , the former is not tenable on the grounds of what we know about stellar atmospheres while the latter can not be reconciled with the presence of the photospheric spots strongly suggesting that the primary does rotate as a solid body .",
    "we present here a radical and perhaps controversial suggestion : the primary ( and probably the secondary ) do not fill their common equipotential surface and they do not form a contact binary in the sense of lucy s model . our main argument is that the whole upper half of the primary broadening function can be ideally fit by the simple , solid - body rotational profile ( figure  [ fig09 ] ) .",
    "this fact , coupled with the perfectly rotationally synchronized dark spots on the primary , suggests that the primary is indeed a solid body rotator with dimensions smaller than predicted by the contact model .",
    "the rotational broadening appears to be characterized by by @xmath30 km  s@xmath31 in the orbital quadratures and @xmath32 km  s@xmath31 in the secondary minimum when the primary is seen `` from its end '' . with the solid body rotation ,",
    "the `` side '' dimension of the primary is @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the primary s surface is close to , but some 15% inside its _ inner roche lobe_. changes of @xmath34 with the orbital phase ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) for the primary component and for the belt indicate that while the primary is underfilling the inner roche lobe , the belt may have dimensions comparable with the expected size of the contact model ; this estimate includes the very risky assumption that the belt is also a solid body rotator .",
    "the assumption of the detached nature of the primary component cleanly solves the problem of the narrow , `` triangular '' shape of the primary s bf , but at the cost of having to speculate about the `` belt '' .",
    "we think that the belt may be an important source of light in the system ; it is localized in the equatorial plane , it has the surface - brightness properties ( the temperature ) not much different form those of the stellar surfaces , it must be optically and possibly also geometrically thick . _",
    "we stress that that the belt must produce an absorption spectrum , otherwise it would not be seen in the bf formalism_. there are absolutely no indications of any emission lines or of optical polarization @xcite ; the presence of the latter could possibly suggest electron scattering of the stellar spectrum .",
    "not much can be said about the secondary component in the new model , but in section  [ deviate ] we listed enough indications to think that it is quite abnormal .    in our picture ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) ,",
    "both components are seen surrounded by the belt , but their mass centre velocities are not modified .",
    "fits to the upper halves of the primary give a well defined value for @xmath35 km  s@xmath31 ; this semi - amplitude is better defined than using any of the previous measurement techniques . assuming the range of the @xmath36 semi - amplitudes as in the columns ( 2 )  ( 4 ) of table  [ tab03 ] , we arrive at the masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these are values practically identical to the ones determined previously , so the final elements of aw  uma are not changed at all . in particular , the mass ratio is basically the same , @xmath39 .",
    "the question is : why does photometry of aw  uma appear to be in such an excellent agreement with the lucy model ? and",
    "why does the binary appear so stable if it is so complicated ?",
    "frankly , we do not know ... we prefer not to suggest any similarities of aw  uma to known peculiar binaries because such analogies may constrain future options in the interpretation . in this paper , we intended to show only well established observational facts limiting speculations to a minimum .",
    "we note , however , that a period of a strong brightness instability of aw  uma was observed in 1989  1990 by @xcite .",
    "thus , although the star seems to be normally stable and well behaving , this could be the time that the quiescent picture suddenly broke down .",
    "our analysis of the broadening functions for the prototype of extreme - mass ratio contact binaries , aw  uma , indicates that the generally accepted roche model experiences major problems in interpretation of this system .",
    "we see strong indications that the system is not a contact binary and that both stars are smaller than their inner roche lobes .",
    "the interpretation is complicated by the presence of what appears to be a luminous stream of the matter ( optically thick and thus giving the same stellar spectrum ) , encompassing the primary and possibly the whole system and forming an equatorial belt around it .",
    "the equatorial extent of the belt is similar to the size of the common envelope derived in previous contact binary solutions .",
    "the secondary strongly changes its spectroscopic appearance with the orbital phase and does not appear to be a normal star but rather a small stellar core surrounded by a complex disturbance of the belt .",
    "the primary is also showing unexpected deviations from the contact model : the `` triangular '' or `` pointed '' shape of the broadening functions ( too narrow spectral lines ) requires invoking an unusually strong limb darkening and/or a strongly differential rotation of the primary ( the equatorial regions moving faster than polar ) .",
    "while the first explanation is unphysical , the second is inferior in terms of the overall fit to the data ; it is contradicted by the presence of photospheric spots on the primary which were stable over one year .",
    "our results and suggestions are radical ones because aw  uma  which appeared to be one of the best examples of the contact model  would not be then a contact binary in the sense envisaged by lucy and by many researchers who followed his ideas .",
    "but we are driven to this desperate move only after exhausting all other alternatives .",
    "a belt in the equatorial plane , encompassing both components is not an entirely new idea . in 1950 , in his book @xcite presented a picture ( p.  188",
    ", figure 28 ) which is very close to what we have in mind for aw  uma .",
    "obviously , the new model would question the validity of the lucy model for at least some binaries now considered to be in good contact .",
    "this is the price we appear to pay for having access to good spectral data and to improved methods of spectral analysis .",
    "indeed , with only photometric information , and with the lucy model , the realm of contact binaries has been not only amazingly appealing , but also much simpler .",
    "we stress that irrespectively of assumptions used to describe the details of the whole picture , the radial velocities of the photocentres give the spectroscopic mass ratio of aw  uma close to @xmath40 .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the seemingly incontestable photometric mass ratio of @xmath41 . by taking global averages of our results , the masses of the components",
    "are approximately @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where the uncertainties are estimated from systematic effects related to choices made in the analysis and are far larger than any of the formal uncertainty estimates for individual methods .",
    "since the spectral data ( in spite of several serious problems which we tried to stress rather than hide ) directly give us radial velocities of the mass centres , the spectroscopic mass ratio of @xmath40 must be close to the true one . the mass - ratio discrepancy , together with direct deviations from the expected velocity field , may be pointing to us a major deficiency in our assumptions about contact binaries . at this point",
    "we can not state whether these deficiencies are _ present _ or are merely _ best detectable _ only at the very low mass ratio of aw  uma . in either case , the deviations from the roche / lucy model appear to be highly significant for interpretation of contact binary systems .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of bohdan paczyski , the formidable teacher and towering intellect , but also an understanding colleague and friend . as a student",
    ", he discovered aw  uma in 1963 and recognized it as a particularly important one for understanding of contact binary stars .",
    "this star accompanied him over 44 years of his immensely productive astronomical life to his last contribution which he directly supervised @xcite .",
