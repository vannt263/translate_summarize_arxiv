    "after the observation in recent years of solar@xcite and atmospheric@xcite neutrino oscillations and their confirmation at reactor@xcite and accelerator@xcite neutrino experiments , the high priority of current neutrino experiments is to measure the @xmath0 mixing angle , and to improve the accuracy in the measurement of oscillation parameters .",
    "a non - zero value for the @xmath0 is fundamental for the search for cp violation .",
    "reactor experiments play an important role in this search , relying on their unique ability to measure the @xmath0 angle without coupling with the cp violation phase .",
    "the inverse-@xmath1 reaction [ ibd ] ( @xmath2 ) is one of the oscillations sought for @xmath0 at reactor neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it provides a very good sample of signal events with very little background contamination leading to an excellent signal to background ratio with an energy threshold of 1.8  mev .",
    "an ibd event is identified by looking for a prompt energy deposition followed by a @xmath3 capture energy signal .",
    "these two signals are correlated in time .",
    "the @xmath4energy can then be calculated using the deposited energy of the prompt events .",
    "figure  [ fig : flux_and_xsec ] shows the measured reactor neutrino spectrum with the @xmath4flux from a nuclear reactor and the ibd cross - section@xcite .",
    "a reactor neutrino detector consists of a central detector filled with liquid scintillator loaded with gd .",
    "the gd is mixed with the scintillator in order to increase the neutron capture probability and because the neutron capture on gd has a characteristic energy and capture time that can be used to substantially reduce background events .",
    "multiple gamma - rays are released during the neutron capture on gd , with a total deposited energy of @xmath58  mev , which gives another easy way to isolate signal events and reduce background . in order to improve our knowledge of @xmath0 , high precision experiments with dedicated detector design",
    "are required .",
    "the statistical and systematic errors should be maintained at less than a 1% level to improve the limits coming from previous experiments like chooz@xcite ) .",
    "there are several methods to accomplish this : use a near detector to reduce rate and spectral shape uncertainties , use large or multiple detectors to increase the fiducial volume and so decrease the statistical error , or use multi - core sites to get as many @xmath4as possible .",
    "this should be coupled with an understanding and reduction of the background : deep underground detector sites will help to reduce all the cosmic muon backgrounds and an accurate calibration system will help to reduce background due to radioactivity and systematic uncertainties due to energy reconstruction . in this paper",
    "we discuss the potential of current reactor neutrino experiments to limit or measure @xmath0 .",
    "we will analyze the physics potential of the following reactor neutrino experiments : daya bay@xcite , double chooz@xcite and reno@xcite .",

    "all calculations are conducted presuming a fixed value of the mass splitting @xmath10 ev@xmath11 , as measured at very high precision by the minos experiment@xcite .",
    "our evaluation of experimental capabilities are performed with a custom sensitivity toolkit , written in c++ with root , which allows a proper treatment of all reactor and detector systematic uncertainties relevant to multi - core and multi - detector experiments .",
    "calculations are executed by generating a set of experimental data with a presumption of no oscillations .",
    "this null - oscillation observation is then fit to a predicted data set with a ",
    "pulls approach\"@xcite multi - parameter minimization , and the uncertainty interval on @xmath12 is evaluated .",

    "sec : parameters ] .",
    "the basic set - up of all the existing ( or under construction ) reactor experiments consists of a identical near and a far detector .",
    "the far detector is generally positioned deeper underground ( @xmath5300  m.w.e . ) than the near detector ( @xmath5150  m.w.e . ) to allow more natural shielding from cosmic muons .",
    "for the same reason , the outer veto detector is bigger for the near than for the far detector .",
    "the near detector is typically at an average distance of @xmath5200/300  m from the nuclear reactor cores and the far detector is at @xmath51000  m. the nuclear reactors used by the reactor experiments are pressurized water reactors ( pwr ) and their number and distances with respect to the near detectors varies between experiments@xcite .",
    "double chooz@xcite is comprised of the simplest site configuration : two pwr reactors achieving 4.25 gw@xmath15 each , and two detectors of 8.3 tons fiducial mass each , located in the ardennes region of france .",
    "the double chooz near and far detector sites , situated at respective mean baselines of 395  m and 1050  m , are not placed in a symmetric configuration with respect to the reactor cores , but along a curve of iso - flux such that the ratio of neutrino events from each reactor is equal in the two detectors .",
    "the reno experiment@xcite is located near the yonggwang power station in south korea , which hosts six reactors of 2.73 gw@xmath15 power each .",
    "the reno near and far detectors are located along a line running perpendicular to , and through the midpoint of , the line of reactors , at distances of 290  m and 1,380  m. daya bay s experimental configuration@xcite is situated amongst three separate sites , each hosting two reactors of 2.95 gw@xmath15 power , in southeastern china .",
    "daya bay s eight detector modules of 20 fiducial tons each will be distributed among three sites .",
    "four detectors will be placed at a  far \" site , and two each at near sites named for the reactor complexes to which they are closest : daya bay ( dyb ) and ling ao ( la ) .",
    "daya bay s far sites lie between 1,600 and 1,900  m from the sites reactors , while the near detectors are at baselines of 360  m ( for dyb ) and 480 to 525  m ( for la , with respect to the ling ao and ling ao - ii reactor sites ) to their eponymous reactors .",
    "it is notable that the daya bay experiment has two near detector sites while double chooz and reno have only one .",
    "the near and far detectors are designed to have the same exact fiducial mass of 10 or 20  tons of liquid scintillator with a main detector usually sub - divided into three volumes , an inner veto and an outer veto system .",
    "the innermost detector is an acrylic vessel ( thickness @xmath510  mm ) that houses the @xmath16-target liquid : a mixture of liquid scintillator doped with gadolinium .",
    "the presence of gadolinium enhances neutron capture",
    ". the design and installation of this volume emphasizes radio - purity and long - term scintillator stability .",
    "the @xmath16-target volume is surrounded by a @xmath17-catcher , a thick ( @xmath560  cm ) gd - free liquid scintillator layer in a second acrylic vessel , used to detect escaping from the @xmath16-target .",
    "the light yield of the @xmath17-catcher scintillator is matched to the @xmath16-target scintillator to provide identical light yield across the full inner volume . outside",
    "the @xmath17-catcher is the buffer , a @xmath5100  cm thick layer filled with mineral oil .",
    "the buffer works to shield from the radioactivity of photomultipliers ( pmts ) and from the surrounding rock .",
    "pmts are installed on the stainless steel buffer tank inner wall to collect light from the inner volumes .",
    "these three volumes and the pmts constitute the inner detector ( i d ) .",
    "outside the i d , and optically separated from it , is a @xmath550  cm thick `` inner veto '' liquid scintillator ( iv ) .",
    "the iv is equipped with generally smaller pmts and functions as a cosmic muon veto and as a shield to spallation neutrons produced outside the detector .",
    "the whole detector is further surrounded by 15  cm of demagnetized steel or a water pool equipped with pmts as well , to suppress external @xmath17-rays .",
    "the main detector is covered by an outer veto system ( ov ) made either of plastic scintillator strips or a system of rpc modules .",
    "the ov serves to veto against muons which do not pass through the main detector , but which could act as precursors to cosmogenic backgrounds .",
    "the experiment is calibrated using light sources , radioactive point sources , cosmic rays , and natural radioactivity .",
    "deployments in the target are carried out as well using motorized systems and using the glovebox position on the top of the detector .",
    "we show the double chooz far and the daya bay detectors as examples of reactor neutrino detectors in fig .",
    "[ fig : det ] .",
    "reactor neutrino experiments take advantage of the isotropic emission of @xmath4from the reactor cores , the large ibd cross section and the particular signature of the ibd events in a gd loaded scintillator detector that helps substantially improving the signal to background ratio .",
    "a reactor - based experiment is a disappearance experiment since the anti - neutrinos produced by the reactor do not have enough energy to produce muons ( or taus ) and the neutral - current reactions of the `` oscillated '' @xmath18 or @xmath19 or @xmath4nc interactions have very low cross - section values and are indistinguishable from the backgrounds . the three neutrino reactor experiments , daya bay , double chooz and reno , which are currently under construction or taking data , have been described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : expsetup ] . for comparison , neutrino accelerator experiments like minos@xcite at fermilab and t2k@xcite in japan , will access similar @xmath20 values with gev - energy neutrinos and a baseline on the order of 800/900  km .",
    "neutrinos from reactors have a mean energy of 3  mev , much lower than the energy of the neutrinos produced by accelerator experiments , which means reactor experiments must optimize background reduction . an important difference between reactor and accelerator experiments",
    "is that the oscillation probability for reactor - based neutrino oscillation experiment depends on fewer parameters .",
    "the non - dependence upon the @xmath21 cp violating phase and mass hierarchy makes the reactor neutrino experiment the  cleanest  and most direct way to measure the neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "therefore reactor experiments can not measure @xmath21 cp violating phase and/or mass hierarchy .",
    "while in the case of neutrinos produced by accelerators , the experiment has full control over the beam ( for example when the @xmath16 are produced in time and their directions ) , the flux of @xmath4from a nuclear reactor can not be changed . however , in practice , a pwr get refueled every 12 months , this allow the experiment to have a period of data taking with a different neutrino flux and that is used to validate background estimations .",
    "a special case here is the double chooz experiment that having only two reactor cores have a very good probability to have short periods of time with both reactors off .",
    "these periods are extremely valuable because allow the experiment to have a precise background measurements .",
    "the sensitivity ( or capability ) of a reactor neutrino experiment to measure @xmath0 depends on different factors .",
    "any indication of neutrino oscillations could be due either to the neutrino oscillations or to an incorrect prediction of the anti - neutrino flux from the reactor cores .",
    "in past experiments , the determination of the neutrino flux was based on measurement of the reactor thermal power and flux calculation , which nowadays can be done with high precision .",
    "however , in current reactor experiments this will no longer be an issue because of the presence of a near detector , closer to the reactor cores , dedicated to the precise measurement of the un - oscillated neutrino flux .",
    "the near detector reduces also other uncertainties like  spill - in / spill - out \" .",
    "an event is define as  spill in / out \" when the neutrino interaction happen in the neutrino detector target volume , but the neutron escapes and captures into the @xmath17-catcher or vice - versa .",
    "a special case is the first result from the double chooz experiment : the final oscillation was produced using the far detector only@xcite . in this case",
    "only the far detector was used for the analysis and that required an accurate determination of the @xmath4spectrum and its absolute normalization@xcite .",
    "we will briefly discuss how this accuracy in the @xmath4spectrum is achieved in sec .",
    "[ sec : reactor_spectrum ] for a more accurate discussion please see p. huber _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the systematic errors need to be understood at percent level since what a reactor neutrino oscillation experiment aims to detect is a small oscillation disappearance signal .",
    "backgrounds arise from processes mimicking a time coincidence with n - gd - capture - like emission .",
    "it is very important to maintain backgrounds associated with cosmic muons as low as possible , for this reason the use of different high efficiency veto systems ( like inner - veto and outer - veto combinations ) and build detector under natural hill is very important .",
    "natural hill offers a good detector shield against cosmic ray muons induced backgrounds . to be noticed here that the near and far detectors will have in some cases different background ( due to different overburden ) and signal ( distance to cores ) rates . in the following",
    "we will discuss three kinds of backgrounds : accidental , correlated and cosmogenic isotopes .",
    "the prompt component of the background signal is produced by natural radioactivity within the detector . to reduce potential effects of this background ,",
    "the modern experiments all utilize a buffer volume of non - scintillating oil to shield the active regions of the detector from the naturally - radioactive photomultipliers .",
    "also , emphasis has been placed on radio purity during the choice of detector materials and detector construction .",
    "this background may typically be measured to high precision .",
    "this background will be considered in the rest of this review as fully correlated between detectors .",
    "a fast neutron is produced by nuclear spallation outside of the detector and interacts with a proton within the detector , causing a prompt signal as the proton recoils and scintillates .",
    "the neutron then thermalizes within the detector , and captures to provide the delayed component of the signal .",
    "most of the time the stopping - muon background category is included in the correlated background : a muon entering the detector interacting in the scintillator ( prompt signal ) and then stopping and releasing a michel electron ( delayed signal ) . for simplicity and",
    "because some details of the reactor experiment analysis are currently not well known , we will also consider this background as correlated between detectors but we would like to mention that this is not entirely correct : the different locations of the far and near detectors in terms of overburden determine different muon fluxes and a different muon energy spectrum .",
    "the muon flux determines the rate of production of long - lived isotopes like @xmath22li and @xmath23he . to compensate for this effect , the far and near detector outer veto designs need to be modified as well as the signal selection cuts , which introduces additional systematic errors uncorrelated between detectors .",
    "a cosmic - ray muon interacts with a @xmath24c nucleus and causes an inelastic scattering , creating long - lived neutron - heavy isotopes such as @xmath22li and @xmath23he .",
    "these isotopes have mean lifetimes on the order of milliseconds , preventing their being vetoed .",
    "they mimic an ibd signal when they do finally decay , with particles released in the decay providing the prompt component , and often releasing one or more neutrons to capture as a delayed component .",
    "the same considerations as for the previous background apply in this case .",
    "the goal for a one detector analysis is the correct estimation of the @xmath4reactor flux .",
    "first ingredients is the measurement of the reactor thermal power for each of the reactor cores .",
    "based on that measurements , and knowing the fuel composition of the reactors , the burn - up state is calculated as a function of time using one of the available reactor simulation codes ( for example mure or dragon@xcite ) .",
    "a reactor simulation code produces an instantaneous fission rate for each of the reactor fissile isotopes as a function of time in the fuel burn up cycle .",
    "at this point the neutrino spectrum is calculated from the fission rate and as last step , the neutrino spectrum is converted into a positron spectrum",
    ". we will give a brief description here of these three steps .",

    "the reno near detector is at a distance ranging from 300 to 740  m from the reactor cores and most of the @xmath4flux comes from the 2 closest reactors at a distance of @xmath5350  m. we found a decrease on the sensitivity to @xmath56 at 68% cl of @xmath5 4% ( from 0.027 to 0.028 ) while increasing the reactor flux uncertainties from 5% to 15% .",
    "we have also evaluated the sensitivity to @xmath57 for the daya bay experiment with only  dyb \" site data considering 300 days of actual data taking .",
    "the  dyb \" site see most of the @xmath4flux coming from the dyb closest cores at 360 m while the rest of the flux is coming from 2 different baselines ( 1,1  km and 1,6  km respectively from ling ao - i and ling ao - ii ) .",
    "we calculate a sensitivity for @xmath56 at 68% cl equal to @xmath58 .",
    "the dyb sensitivity result shows the power of the rate+shape analysis and it is included just as an example .",
    "the use of nuclear reactors to study neutrino oscillations started with the chooz@xcite experiment and in recent years has reached a high level of sophistication .",
    "actual reactor experiments use multiple detectors , multiple baselines and optimized designs to reject backgrounds .",
    "the use of multiple detectors make the uncertainties due to reactor flux calculations negligible but a lot of progress has been made also in the accuracy of the reactor neutrino flux and spectrum predictions .",
    "the latest result from double chooz of @xmath13 0.086 @xmath14 0.041  ( stat ) @xmath140.030  ( syst)@xcite has shown how a reactor experiment can achieve good sensitivity for @xmath57 without the use of a near detector . new results from reno , daya bay and double chooz are expected in 2012 .",
