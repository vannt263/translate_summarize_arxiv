    "since many years , the high energy behavior of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory has attracted interest , and extensive calculations have been performed in order to understand the structure well beyond leading orders of perturbation theory . in this context , a special role is played by the regge limit which is closely connected with unitarity of the theory .    the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite has raised new hopes to determine the high energy behavior to all orders of the t hooft coupling @xmath2 , including the strong coupling region , at least for those gauge theories which possess a dual string theory description .",
    "the most prominent example of such a duality relates 4d super yang - mills ( sym ) theory with @xmath3 supersymmetries to type iib string theory in the anti - desitter background @xmath4 . through the correspondence , the gauge theoretic bfkl pomeron  @xcite gets related to graviton on the string theory side  @xcite .    in  @xcite and  @xcite",
    "we have examined this correspondence in some detail .",
    "stimulated by qcd where @xmath5 scattering provides a safe framework for investigating the bfkl pomeron , we have studied the elastic scattering of two @xmath1-currents  @xcite in @xmath3 sym theory . on the weak coupling side , the high energy scattering amplitude factorizes into the current impact factors and the bfkl green s function . in  @xcite",
    "the @xmath1-current impact factor has been calculated to leading order .",
    "the bfkl green s function is known also in nlo  @xcite . in the strong coupling region ,",
    "the method of calculating leading order correlations function was defined in  @xcite .",
    "it involves the summation of witten diagrams containing supergravity fields which live on the @xmath6 space .",
    "our calculation of the high energy behavior of witten diagrams has shown that the scattering amplitudes for infinite t hooft coupling @xmath2 also come as a convolution of impact factors and an exchange propagator , just as in the weakly coupled theory .",
    "the convolution is defined through an integration over the radial direction of the @xmath6 geometry . as a result of our calculation",
    ", we have obtained an expression for the @xmath1-current impact factor at @xmath7 .",
    "corrections of the order @xmath8 require string theory calculations . as to the exchanged graviton ,",
    "witten diagrams in the regge limit yield a power law behavior @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the spin of the graviton .",
    "the higher order corrections to the graviton trajectory j  =  2- + o ( ) , can not be derived from witten diagrams , and they have been deduced from other lines of arguments  @xcite . in  @xcite a representation for the regge limit of four current correlators has been suggested which would allow to interpolate between weak and strong limits .",
    "we have not attempted to cast our result for the witten diagram into this form .    within qcd , it is well known that the bfkl pomeron violates unitarity bounds since it grows as @xmath11 with @xmath12 at very high energies .",
    "consequently the pomeron must be tamed by suitable corrections .",
    "elaborate calculations have been performed in order to identify the relevant corrections within perturbation theory .",
    "an example arises in the context of deep inelastic electron proton scattering at small @xmath13 ( which is related to the elastic scattering of a virtual photon on the proton ) .",
    "it has been argued that the most important corrections to the bfkl exchange are given by fan diagrams ( an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : triplereggeqcd]a ) which contain the triple pomeron vertex .",
    "this vertex describes the splitting of one bfkl pomeron into two pomerons .",
    "a derivation of this result is obtained by considering , first , the scattering of the virtual photon on two ( weakly coupled ) nucleons and , then , closing the two bfkl pomerons at the lower end by integrating over the diffractive squared mass @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : triplereggeqcd]b ) . as a key feature , the fan diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : triplereggeqcd]a .",
    "contains , in its lower part , the exchange of two bfkl pomerons which comes with a minus sign relative to the single bfkl exchange . at high energies",
    ", double pomeron exchange grows as @xmath15 , and thus starts to weaken the growth of the single bfkl exchange . in preparation for extending this discussion to @xmath0 sym theory ,",
    "one may replace the two nucleons at the bottom by virtual photons . in this way",
    ", the essential amplitude to be studied , becomes the six - point electromagnetic current correlator , evaluated in the triple regge limit .",
    "it is a remarkable feature of qcd that the two lower pomerons do not couple directly to the upper impact factor .",
    "such a direct coupling would correspond to the eikonal approximation .",
    "the absence of this direct coupling in the leading logarithmic approximation of qcd means that the eikonal picture is not supported .    turning to @xmath0 sym theory , the analogous correlator is the six - point correlator of @xmath1-currents .",
    "our comments on qcd suggest to investigate , as a first step of addressing the unitarization , the six - point @xmath1-current correlator in the limit @xmath16 .    in the weak coupling limit , this high energy limit of the six - point @xmath1-current correlator in @xmath0 sym theory has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the main result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : triplereggesym ] . at high energies",
    ", the six - point amplitude can be written as a sum of several pieces  @xcite ; each of them corresponds to a distinct set of simultaneous energy discontinuities , in agreement with the steinmann relations . for our discussion",

    "the discontinuity of this six - point function across the cut in @xmath14 leads to the cross section of the diffractive scattering process ( in the notations of qcd ) @xmath23 .",

    "[ fig : triplereggesym ] , left figure ) where the two bfkl exchanges couple directly to the upper @xmath1-currents .",
    "the presence of this direct coupling , which is absent in qcd and might be viewed as a support of eikonalization in @xmath0 sym theory , can be traced back to the fact that fermions ( and scalars ) belong to the adjoint representation .",
    "the corresponding scattering amplitude is of the form _",
