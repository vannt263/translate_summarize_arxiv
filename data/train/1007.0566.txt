    "our goal is to identify functional properties of nodes based on the network structure .",
    "connection between network structure and its functionality is important , many attempts were made to find functional signatures in the network structure , such as @xcite , for a review see @xcite . as tagging network nodes and edges with functional attributes",
    "depends on external information and is not a completely unique procedure , the original problem needs reformulation which is tractable with graph - theoretical tools .",
    "the function real - world networks perform constrains their structure . yet , one often has more detailed information about the network structure than about the functions it may perform .",
    "we focus on systems , either natural or artificial , which process signals and are comprised of many interconnected elements . from a signal processing point of view",
    ", global information about network structure is encoded in the shortest paths , i.e. if signal processing is assumed to be fast , most of network communication is propagated along the shortest paths . therefore global and local properties of shortest paths are relevant for understanding organisation of the signal processing in the system represented with a suitable network . during signal transmission ,",
    "signals are being spread and condensed in the nodes , as well as along network edges .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that in case of cerebral cortex , using a simplified version of the convergence degree ( cd ) , it was possible to connect structural and functional features of the network .",
    "in complex networks , signal processing characteristics are also determined by the level of network circularity ( which in biology and especially neural science is known as reverberation , for obvious reasons ) .",
    "possibility to go around _ chordless _ circles necessitates simultaneous quantification of signal condensing , spreading along network edges and edge circularity .",
    "here we generalise edge convergence and divergence @xcite , and take into account the existence of circles in the network , treating their effects separately from the effect of branching .",
    "for that reason we refine the definition of edge convergence and introduce the overlapping set of an edge , both notions are to be defined in a precise manner later in the text .",
    "our approach may be viewed as generalisation of in- , out and strongly connected components of a graph to the level of network edges .",
    "notions introduced have an extra gain , they help clarifying the otherwise murky notion of network causality",
    ". the functional role of a node in a network is defined by the amount of information it injects to or absorbs from the system , or passes on to other nodes . in case of real - world networks",
    "we test our findings using external validation , given the existing body of knowledge about each specific network .",
    "we illustrate the advantage of edge - based approach with the case of strongly connected graphs , where edge - based measures offer deeper understanding of signal processing and transmitting roles of nodes than an analysis which concentrates solely on nodes and their properties .",
    "measures we work with are applicable to networks of all sizes , there is no assumption about `` sufficient '' network size .",
    "more precisely , networks we work with can be small , and applicability to large networks is limited only by the computational capacity needed to find all shortest paths in the network .",
    "the semantics of our approach is tailored to explain signal flow , though our methodology is applicable to directed networks in general . in cases of information processing , regulatory , transportation or any other network",
    "the appropriate semantics of the approach has to be given .    in section [",
    "sec : notion ] we introduce the notions of convergence degree and overlapping set , in section [ sec : nrr ] we define the flow representation , in section [ sec : res ] we analyse four real - world networks and discuss signal transmission , processing and control properties of the small - world networks .",
    "we compute cd - s and ( nontrivial ) overlap probability distributions for three model networks . in the last section",
    "we discuss our results and draw conclusions .",
    "convergence degree was introduced in @xcite for the analysis of cortical networks and was applied to some random networks @xcite .",
    "we modify the measure introduced therein , in order to capture the structure of shortest paths in a more detailed way .",
    "we will discuss both global and local properties of the shortest paths , relevant notions will be distinguished with self explanatory indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of all the shortest paths in the graph @xmath0 .",
    "for any edge @xmath3 we can choose a subset @xmath4 comprised of all the shortest paths which contain the chosen edge @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 uniquely determine two further sets : @xmath6 the set of all the nodes from which the shortest paths in @xmath4 originate , and @xmath7 the set of all the nodes in which the shortest paths in @xmath4 terminate . by definition",
    "we assume that node @xmath8 is in @xmath6 and node @xmath9 is in @xmath7 .",
    "we define a third set , @xmath10 , the intersection of @xmath11- and @xmath12 sets and call it the overlapping set .",
    "we note that @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , respectively @xmath13 ) is the edge - level equivalent of the in - component ( out - component , respectively strongly connected component ) of the directed network , introduced in @xcite and later refined by @xcite .",
    "notions relevant for understanding the convergence degree and overlapping set are shown in figure [ fig : cd1 ] .    .",
    "global sets are displayed as shaded regions , local sets are comprised of first in - neighbours of node @xmath14 and first out - neighbours of node @xmath15 inside the shaded regions , with the exception of node @xmath0 , which is contained in the local and global overlap of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "note the omition of points @xmath18 and @xmath19 from the global input and output sets . ]    from the perspective of the chosen edge , the whole network splits to two , possibly overlapping sets , both of which have rich structure .",
    "shortest paths induce natural stratification on the set @xmath6 , nodes at distance 1 , 2 and so on from the node @xmath8 are uniquely determined .",
    "points at distance @xmath20 from the tail form the @xmath20-th stratum of @xmath6 .",
    "each point in the @xmath20-th stratum is a tail of an edge with a head in the @xmath21-th stratum .",
    "edges connecting @xmath20-th stratum with any stratum @xmath22 are prohibited .",
    "edges from the @xmath11 strata to the @xmath12 strata are prohibited , since those would alter the shortest paths between the sets .",
    "the set @xmath7 is stratified in a similar fashion .",
    "points in the intersection of @xmath6 with @xmath7 inherit both stratifications .",
    "stratification of @xmath23 and @xmath24 sets is illustrated in figure [ fig : strata ] .",
    ", output strata are labelled with indices @xmath25 and overlap strata have double indices @xmath26 .",
    "examples of prohibited edges are shown with dashed lines , necessary edges are shown with full line .",
    "strata @xmath27 and @xmath28 are connected with the edge itself and they do not overlap . ]    local versions of these sets are defined as follows : @xmath29 is the set of all the first predecessors of the node @xmath8 , while @xmath30 is the set of first successors of the node @xmath9 . when indices @xmath0 or @xmath1 are omitted , either is used .",
    "if the graph has circles , @xmath11 and @xmath12 sets may overlap , thus it makes sense to introduce strict @xmath31 and @xmath32 sets , which are defined as follows :    @xmath33    @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are generalisations of the notion of first predecessors and successors of a node , and accordingly , cardinalities of these sets are generalisations of the in- and out - degrees of nodes .",
    "we note that global and local versions of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and overlapping sets are two extremes of two set families defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath34 be the set of points from which paths at distance less or equal to @xmath35 from the point @xmath8 begin , analogously let @xmath36 be the set of points at which paths at distance less or equal to @xmath37 from the point @xmath9 terminate .",
    "the two sets are balls centred at @xmath8 and @xmath9 with radii @xmath35 and @xmath37 . instead of balls , one may consider the surfaces of the balls , in which case points at distances @xmath35 and @xmath37 are considered .",
    "the global @xmath11-set is thus @xmath38 , whilst the local @xmath11-set corresponds to points at surfaces with radii 1 , @xmath39 .",
    "the notion of strict in- , out- and overlapping sets is important for understanding causality relations in network systems .",
    "global signal flow through an edge @xmath5 induces separation of network nodes into four classes :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 , in which are the causes of the flow .",
    "@xmath41 , in which the effects of flow are manifested .",
    "3 .   the overlap , whose elements represent neither cause nor effect . relation between elements in the overlap",
    "is often described as circular- or network causality .",
    "points which are not members of @xmath42 form the remaining , fourth category which has no causal relationship with the signal flowing through the given edge .",
    "we stress that for a generic graph no such partition is possible based on node properties .",
    "e.g. if we tried to define analogous notions based on node properties , all analogue node classes would coincide for the case of strongly connected graphs .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 sets would coincide , and all distinction between different node classes would have been lost .    for each edge",
    "we define three additional measures , namely the relative size of the strict in - set @xmath43 , the relative size of the strict out - set @xmath44 , and the relative size of the overlap between in - set and out - set @xmath45 , as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath48 .",
    "note that equation [ eq : uc3 ] is the jaccard coefficient @xcite of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 sets .",
    "it is possible to generate networks which have edges with large global overlaps , one simply adds randomly a small number of edges to an initial oriented circle .",
    "this example helps understanding the meaning of ( possibly large ) global overlaps : they are characteristic of edges in chordless circles . more precisely , for and edge to have a nonempty overlapping set it is necessary , but not sufficient , to be on a chordless circle of length at least three .",
    "we illustrate this by an example . in the graph shown in figure",
    "[ fig : circ ] , the only edge with nonempty overlapping set is @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath51 is on the chordless circle ( 3,1,2,3 ) , whilst the edges @xmath53 and @xmath54 on the same chordless circle have zero overlapping sets .",
    "local overlaps are related to the clustering coefficient of the graph , since they define the probability that the vertices in the neighbourhood of a given vertex are connected to each other .",
    "overlap represents global mutual relationship and a measure of dependence ( in terms of chordless circles ) between @xmath11- and @xmath12 sets .",
    "this dependence is inherent in the network structure .",
    "large jaccard coefficient of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 sets is not detectable with edge betweenness , as it may obtain large values for edges with non - overlapping sets .",
    "the edge convergence degree @xmath55 of the edge @xmath5 is defined as follows : @xmath56 note that the definition of cd uses the normalised sizes of the strict @xmath11- and @xmath12-sets to make the measure independent of the network size .",
    "furthermore , this formula is related to the complement of the jaccard coefficient ( denoted as @xmath57 ) of the @xmath11- and @xmath12-sets , or equivalently to their normalised set - theoretic difference , thus connecting the cd to information theoretical quantities .",
    "the following inequality is obvious : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    directionality of the edge gives meaning to cardinality substraction , as @xmath11 and @xmath12 sets can be distinguished .",
    "if the cd value is close to one , the signal flow through the edge is originating from many sources and terminating in very few sinks , while cd values close to -1 indicate flow formed of few sources and many sinks .",
    "this property justifies rough division of edges according to their cd properties to convergent ( condensing ) , balanced and divergent ( spreading ) .",
    "an oriented circle with at least three nodes has the maximum possible global overlap for each edge , while the absolute value of the global @xmath59 is the smallest possible , in accordance with the inequality ( [ eq : cd_le_ovl ] ) .",
    "we note that cd in an oriented chain monotonously decreases along the chain , whilst the overlap is zero along the chain .",
    "this simple example again illustrates how cd and overlap are sensitive to the network topology .",
    "applicability of the convergence degree is limited by the following facts .",
    "definition of convergence degree makes sense only if not all connections are reciprocal , stated otherwise if there is a definite directionality in the network",
    ". if every connection is reciprocal , the network may be considered unoriented .",
    "for fully reciprocal networks , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 sets would coincide .",
    "second , convergence degree makes sense for a network which is at least weakly connected .",
    "since the number of edges exceeds the number of nodes in a typical connected network , and in many cases we are interested in the role of individual nodes , it is desirable to condense the our primarily edge - based measures to a node - centric view .",
    "the condensed view should reveal several features of interest : local vs global signal processing properties of network nodes , directionality of the information , i.e. whether we are interested in the properties of the incoming or outgoing edges , the third aspect is the statistics , i.e. total or average property of the edges , and finally we may choose edges according to the sign of their cd . condensing",
    "the information about overlapping sets follows the same lines , with the exception of the sign .",
    "we proceed by an example and introduce the following six quantities defined for each node @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the sum of all incoming negative local convergence degrees divided by the node s in - degree , and let @xmath61 denote the sum of all incoming positive convergence degrees divided by the node s in - degree , i.e. @xmath60 is the average negative inwards pointing local cd of the node @xmath8 .    in a similar way we can also define @xmath62 and @xmath63 for outgoing convergence degrees . for clarity",
    "we give formulae for @xmath60 and @xmath62 . @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote in - degree and out - degree of the node @xmath8 , @xmath66 is the unit step function continuous from the left .",
    "@xmath67 denotes the first in - neighbours of the node @xmath8 , the analogous notation @xmath68 is selfexplanatory .",
    "@xmath69    we also define @xmath70 , the sum of all incoming local overlaps and @xmath71 , the sum of all outgoing local overlaps each being normalised with the corresponding node degree .",
    "@xmath72 factors before the sums serve normalisation purposes , each @xmath73 should have a value within the @xmath74 $ ] interval .",
    "these quantities are average local cd - s and relative overlaps corresponding to each node .",
    "one is also interested in the total of the in- and out pointing edges of a given cd sign , and define the corresponding version of the node - reduced convergence degree . for normalisation purposes the sums in @xmath75 s are divided by @xmath76 , the maximal possible number of the outgoing ( incoming ) connections a node can have , where @xmath77 denotes the number nodes in the network .",
    "thus , using the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 one can construct four different cd flow representations of a network , namely @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the incoming node - reduced cd values are understood as coordinates of the @xmath84 axis , while the outgoing cd values are interpreted as the coordinates of the @xmath85 axis . in order to display overlaps together with the convergence degrees in a single figure ,",
    "overlaps are treated as the coordinates of the @xmath86 axis , the incoming overlaps being positive and the outgoing understood negative .",
    "each point is represented in each octant of the flow representation .",
    "the points in the @xmath87 plane are not independent , given the values in the diagonal quadrants , the other two quadrants can be reconstructed with reflections .    representation of graph nodes in the @xmath87 plane is related to the cd flow through the nodes in the following way .",
    "the cd flow @xmath88 through the node @xmath8 is defined as follows : @xmath89 the first sum is equal to @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the appropriate weight , whilst the second sum equals @xmath92 .",
    "the flow can be rewritten as @xmath93 if the first difference on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : flow_2 ] ) is large ( small ) , i.e. the representative point is close to the diagonal @xmath94 and is far from the origin in the top left ( bottom right ) quadrant , and the second difference is small ( large ) , i.e. the representative point is close to the diagonal @xmath94 and is far from the origin in the bottom right ( top left ) quadrant , the node @xmath8 is _ source _ ( _ sink _ ) of the cd flow .",
    "analogously , the cd flow can be written as : @xmath95 where the two differences determine the router characteristics of the node @xmath8 . in this sense flow representation",
    "is a means to independently study different components of the cd flow .",
    "different circles may have common nodes , thus the overlap flow defines whether different circles passing through the given node have more common parts after of before the given node , i.e. whether a node is a source or sink of circularity .",
    "precise meaning of large and small depends on the criteria used to classify the representative points of the node - reduced representation .",
    "nodes can be classified based on the cd ( relative overlap ) flow , besides distinction based on the sign , the scale is continuous , there is no a - priori grouping of nodes .",
    "further classification can be made based on the structure of the cd ( relative overlap ) flow , i.e. based on properties of different terms defining the cd ( relative overlap ) flow .",
    "components of the flow representation for two toy graphs are shown in figure [ fig : lepke ] .",
    "we observe that same nodes may be global , but not local cd flow sinks or sources .    , the right column represents graph nodes with @xmath96 .",
    "every overlapping set is empty for the lower graph , because all chordless circles are of length two .",
    "some points have the same coordinates in the flow representation .",
    "e.g. , point d is is global , but not local cd flow sink . ]",
    "each octant represents different aspect of convergence - divergence relations in the network .",
    "these quantities bring us to the actual interpretation of edge convergence and divergence as a characterisation of signal flow on the nodes of a network . to make statements about the signal flow derived from the cd flow",
    ", we have to make an inversion of properties , as nodes which behave as a sink of convergence , actually inject information to the network , thus they are sources of signal . respectively ,",
    "cd sources are sinks of signal . assuming this interpretation we can extract useful information from the flow representation regarding the signal processing roles of nodes in the network . nodes which have incoming edges with cardinalities of the @xmath11sets ( @xmath12sets ) being larger than cardinalities of the @xmath12sets ( @xmath11sets ) , and outgoing edges with cardinalities of the @xmath12sets ( @xmath11sets ) being larger than cardinalities of the @xmath11sets ( @xmath12sets ) are , from the signal processing perspective , identified as sources of signals .",
    "the combination of divergent input ( negative incoming cd sum ) and convergent output ( positive outgoing cd sum ) is , considering the signal flow , equivalent to absorption of signals in the network .",
    "this is represented in the top left quadrant of the @xmath87 plane . on the opposite , the combination of convergent input and divergent output corresponds to the source characteristics of the nodes ( bottom right quadrant of the @xmath87 plane ) .",
    "the top right and bottom left quadrants can be interpreted as a display of _ signed _ relay characteristics of the nodes .",
    "nodes which have incoming edges with cardinalities of the @xmath12sets ( @xmath11sets ) being larger than cardinalities of the @xmath11sets ( @xmath12ets ) , and outgoing edges with cardinalities of the @xmath12sets ( @xmath11sets)being larger than cardinalities of the @xmath11sets ( @xmath12sets ) , are called negative ( positive ) router nodes .",
    "at the same time routing characteristics can be read from the top right and bottom left quadrants .",
    "redistribute _ incoming cd of a given sign to outgoing cd of the _ same _ sign .",
    "additional information is obtained from the @xmath86 coordinate , which gives the average overlap of incoming and respectively , outgoing edges .",
    "this quantity identifies the degree of a node s participation in signal circulation in the network , a property typically associated with control circuits .",
    "graphical presentation of a network is not unique , e.g. isomorphic graphs may look totally different , the petersen graph being a typical example .",
    "community structure is not unique , grouping of points , thus presenting a network can be achieved in a multitude of ways . yet , the flow representation of a network is _ unique _ , though due to possible symmetries it may have a significant amount of redundancy .",
    "this 3d plot of the network is unique in the sense that there is no arbitrariness in the position of the points in the three dimensional space .",
    "the flow representation can be considered as a network fingerprint since isomorphic graphs are mapped to the same plot , and differences between flow representations can be attributed to structural and functional properties of the network .",
    "if all edges are reciprocal or the graph is undirected , the flow representation of the network shrinks to a single point .",
    "the same argument applies to all graphs in which some nodes can not be distinguished due to symmetries .",
    "more precisely , nodes in the orbit of an element generated by the automorphism group of the graph are represented with the same point on the flow representation , as all the value of @xmath73-s are constants on the orbits generated by the automorphism group of the graph .",
    "usefulness and application of the flow representation will be illustrated in the analysis of the real - world networks in section [ sec : real_net ] .",
    "we calculate cd - s for three model networks and analyse cd - s of four real - world networks .      in this section",
    "we analyse functional clusters in real - world networks and the statistical properties of their interconnection .",
    "we analysed two biological and two artificial networks : macaque visuo - tactile cortex @xcite , signal - transduction network of a ca1 neuron @xcite , the call graph of the linux kernel version 2.6.12-rc2 @xcite , and for comparison purposes the street network of rome @xcite .",
    "nodes and edges are defined as follows : in the macaque cortex nodes are cortical areas and edges are cortical fibres , in the signal - transduction network nodes are reactants and edges are chemical reactions , in the call graph nodes are functions and edges are function calls , in the street network the nodes are intersections between roads and edges correspond to roads or road segments .",
    "the first three networks perform computational tasks , linux kernel manages the possibly scarce computational resources , signal - transduction network can be considered as the operating system of a cell , while cortex is an ubiquitous example of a system which simultaneously performs many computationally complex tasks .",
    "the street network is an oriented transportation network , which has a rich structure , as its elements have traffic regulating roles .",
    "the call graph of the linux kernel was constructed in the following way .",
    "we created the call graph of the kernel source which included the smallest number of components necessary to ensure functionality .",
    "the call graph was constructed using the codeviz software @xcite , but it was not identical to the actual network of the functions calling each other , because the software detects only calls that are coded in the source and not the calls only realized during runtime .",
    "the resulting call graph had more than @xmath97 vertices .",
    "as we wanted to perform clustering and statistical tests , the original data was prohibitively large , therefore we applied a community clustering algorithm @xcite to create vertex groups .",
    "we generated a new graph in which the vertices represented the communities of the original call graph and have added edges between vertices representing communities whenever the original nodes in the communities were connected by any number of edges .",
    "definition of the call graph nodes and their connections is analogous to the nodes and connections of the cortical network , as millions of neurons form a cortical area , and two areas are considered to be connected if a relatively small number of neurons in one area is connected to a small number of neurons in another area .",
    "the call graph of the linux kernel will be discussed in section [ sec : aggreg_netw ] .",
    "flow are shown in the left column , components of the average @xmath98 are shown in the right column . displayed are : erds - rnyi graph ( row a ) , macaque visuo - tactile cortex ( row b ) and signal - transduction ( row c ) .",
    "relative overlap flow is indicated by colour intensity . ]",
    "the flow representations of two real - world networks are shown in figure [ fig:3lepke ] and for comparison , in part a , the erds - rnyi network .",
    "we can identify the most important nodes and some general features of the networks as follows .",
    "part b refers to the macaque visuo - tactile cortex .",
    "it is characterised by the alignment of the nodes along a straight line along the main diagonal , and hyperbolic - like pattern in the first and third quadrants , showing reverse ordering in the opposite quadrants , and absence of routers , which refers to a hierarchical organisation . in part c",
    "one can see the signal - transduction network of a hippocampal neuron . in the signal - transduction network of the hippocampal neurons ,",
    "the molecules with the most negative cd flow are involved , among other functions , in the regulation of key participants of the signal transduction cascade such as the camp second messengers .",
    "molecules with large positive cd flow play function in cell survival and differentiation , as well as apoptosis .",
    "router - like proteins are involved in diverse functions , notably the regulation of synaptic transmission in addition to those mentioned above .",
    "however , it should be noted that partly because of the paucity of our knowledge about many of the components of this network , as well as because of redundancy , i.e. overlapping functionality , we could give here only a very superficial classification .",
    "all edges of the signal transduction network fall in one of the three classes : excitatory , inhibitory and neutral , @xcite .",
    "cd and overlap data were unrelated to the inhibitory , excitatory or neutral nature of network edges .",
    "empirical distributions of cd - s and overlaps were alike for each edge class , see figure [ fig : stn_edges ] in the appendix .",
    "we have analysed the flow representations in order to identify different features of signal processing .",
    "network nodes are points represented in a 6d space of the flow representation , and in order to identify different signal processing , transmitting and controlling groups of nodes we performed clustering using gaussian mixture and bayesian information criterion implemented in r @xcite .",
    "we wish to stress that the clustering we performed is not a form of community detection , but grouping of nodes with respect to their functional signal processing properties .",
    "community detection can identify dense substructures , but it provides no information about the nature of signal processing , transmission or control . in each network",
    "we determined local and global , total and average signal processing clusters , have determined their properties , and have analysed the nature of cd - s and relative overlaps within and between clusters .",
    "clustering of nodes with respect to their functional properties resulted in contingency tables , with clusters being labels of the contingency table , and entries in the contingency able being numbers of edges within and between respective clusters . to estimate the randomness of the contingency tables we performed monte carlo implementation of the two sided fisher s exact test .",
    "number of replicates used in the monte carlo test was @xmath97 in each case .",
    "the exact fisher s test characterises the result of the clustering procedure , it quantifies how much the distribution of edges within and between clusters differ .",
    "we summarise the results in table [ tab : eft ] . for comparison purposes benchmark graphs",
    "were generated using algorithms described in @xcite .",
