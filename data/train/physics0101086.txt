    "( [ eqn1 ] ) based on cylindrical ( azimuthal ) symmetry which should be of wide interest in physics and astrophysics .",
    "this expansion arose in a recent investigation by two of us @xcite of gravitational potentials in circular cylindrical coordinates @xmath0 = ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 with @xmath22 a legendre function of the second kind of half - integer degree @xcite , and @xmath23 defined as @xmath24    although this expansion has been recorded in many places @xcite , its full significance has not been appreciated .",
    "we have traced its earliest occurrence to the work of e. heine in the mid - nineteenth century @xcite and will , therefore , call it the `` heine identity . '' at its most general , it takes the form @xmath25 reducing to eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) when applied to the inverse distance between two points .",

    "this reduction from six to four essential variables has not been appreciated fully .",
    "we were led to it by the parallel investigation below of the alternative expansion , and note that it is a natural consequence of the separation distance being independent of the orientation of that separation in the laboratory frame , and thus independent of two angles serving to specify that orientation .",
    "this multipole expansion in terms of spherical harmonics is very broadly utilized across the physical sciences .",
    "for example , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 interpreted as the quantum numbers of orbital angular momentum and its azimuthal projection , respectively , a whole technology of racah - wigner or clebsch - gordan algebra is available @xcite for handling all angular ( that is , geometrical or symmetry ) aspects of an @xmath38-body problem , the dynamics being confined to radial matrix elements of the coefficients @xmath39 in eq .",
