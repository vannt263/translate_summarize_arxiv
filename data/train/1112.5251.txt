    "in contrast , the exponent of the new sample exhibits a pronounced maximum at around 4k with @xmath104 , followed by a minimum around 0.3k with @xmath105 and a value of @xmath103 at lowest temperatures . for this analysis",
    "we estimate @xmath95 by linear extrapolation to @xmath106 , however , the choice of @xmath95 influences @xmath107 only at lowest temperatures .",
    "this is visible by the larger error bars of @xmath101 below 0.1k , which result from the uncertainty of @xmath95 .",
    "beside this temperature - dependent analysis of the exponent , we additionally fit the data with a single @xmath101 in a larger temperature range . for the resistivity data below 0.1k",
    ", we obtain an exponent of @xmath108 . a fit below 0.2k down to lowest temperatures gives @xmath109 , in agreement with the differential analysis .",
    "we note that the evolution of the exponent for these two different samples presents qualitative similarities to quasi - classical calculations for a system in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic qcp . there",
    ", a. rosch studied the influence of strong anisotropic scattering due to spin fluctuations for different amount of disorder and he observed broad ranges of exponents between 1 and 2 together with oscillatory behaviour @xcite . it might be interesting to implement the specifics of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 to such a model to get further insight into the transport phenomena at this local qcp .",
    "specific heat divided by temperature , @xmath110 , of ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 ( p - type ) on a linear temperature scale . at @xmath111k , a pronounced anomaly is visible which is suppressed in @xmath112 t .",

    "[ secyisgrowth ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic ground states of these two derivatives of the baal@xmath10 structure are very different , although , the tetragonal lattice parameters are nearly identical , as discussed in sec .",

    "have shown that i - type ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 is a heavy - fermion metal situated on the non - magnetic side of a qcp with fermi - liquid behaviour below 0.4k and quite large single - ion anisotropy , reflected in a larger susceptibility perpendicular to the crystallographic @xmath11-direction @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the susceptibility of p - type ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 is rather isotropic @xcite and entropy as well as resistivity measurements suggest a much smaller kondo - temperature , @xmath113k , in contrast to @xmath114k for the i - type system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in p - type crystals a prominent anomaly was observed in the specific heat below 1k , which was suggested to be a magnetic phase transition .    here , we further like to establish that p - type ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 indeed orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath115k by means of susceptibility measurements below 2k . for this purpose ,",
    "p - type crystals were prepared with yb - excess as described in sec .",
    "[ secyisgrowth ] and the dc susceptibility was measured down to @xmath116k , which was realized with the @xmath91he - option for the mpms ( quantum design ) designed by the iquantum corporation . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig9ptype ] , we present this measurement with @xmath117 t perpendicular to @xmath11 .",
    "a weak anomaly suggests that p - type ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 undergoes a magnetic phase transition at @xmath20k , although the transition is not very sharp .",
    "specific heat measurements on these crystals confirm the earlier measurements in zero field @xcite and are shown in the main part of fig .",
    "[ fig9ptype ] . applying a magnetic field of 0.1 t",
    "does not affect the anomaly at @xmath55 , whereas a field of @xmath118 t suppresses the magnetic transition and shifts the entropy to higher temperatures .",
    "the characteristics of this field dependence confirms the afm nature of the phase transition and classifies p - type ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 as a magnetically ordered system with localized yb@xmath119 moments .",
    "however , the anomalies at @xmath55 are rather broad and we were not able to detect the magnetic transition in low - temperature resistivity measurements , probably due to significant amount of disorder , likely ir - si site exchanges .",
    "in conclusion , we have optimized the single crystal growth of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , using an indium - flux method with 96 mol% indium in closed ta - crucibles .",
    "the optimal initial composition of the elements within the flux , yb : rh : si=3:2.2:1.8 , is far away from the stoichiometric ratio but was found to give large ( up to 100 mg ) single crystals .",
    "prior to the optimization of the temperature - time profile , we determined the liquidus temperature ( @xmath120c ) of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 in 96 mol% in - flux by means of differential thermal analysis and use a two - zone resistance furnace to reduce the time of the crystal growth .",
    "the resulting single crystals have a residual resistivity of only @xmath1 cm and present sharp anomalies in the transport and thermodynamic properties at the low - lying afm phase transition .",
    "the analysis of the temperature - dependence of the electrical - resistivity exponent for this new generation of single crystals reveals a deviation from the linear - in-@xmath2 behaviour below 10k .",
    "ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 was established to be a polymorphic compound which can crystallize in two different crystallographic modifications , with p - type crystals ( cabe@xmath0ge@xmath0 structure ) being the high - temperature and i - type ( thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure ) the low - temperature phase .",
    "the latter can be stabilized by annealing selected crystals at @xmath64c for 150 hours .",
    "we further found that the optimal growth parameters for ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 and ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 from in - flux are much different .",
    "for ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 , the applicable range of the initial composition is very narrow and small excess of yb leads to the formation of p - type crystals .",
    "interestingly , both modifications have different physical ground states . in p - type ybir@xmath0si@xmath0",
    ", the magnetic @xmath6-electrons undergo an afm phase transition at @xmath121k , observed in low - temperature specific - heat and susceptibility measurements , whereas i - type ybir@xmath0si@xmath0 presents a paramagnetic fermi - liquid ground state and is situated on the non - magnetic side of the quantum critical point .",
    "the series yb(rh@xmath3ir@xmath4si@xmath0 , which crystallizes in the i - type structure , is therefore ideally suited to study the phenomena around this quantum phase transition .",
