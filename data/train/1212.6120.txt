    "the european southern observatory is in the process of delivering to its community three public surveys that image the southern hemisphere : the kilo degree survey  @xcite , atlas and vphas+ @xcite .",
    "the surveys are performed using the omegacam wide - field optical imager with 1 square degree fov .",
    "it is the sole instrument on the 2.6 m vlt survey telescope at paranal observatory , chile .",
    "the three eso public surveys span thousands of square degrees of sky obtained over years of observations .",
    "for example , the kilo degree survey will map 1500 square degrees of extragalactic sky in the sloan u , g , r and i passbands .",
    "this requires @xmath1 `` full night equivalents '' spread over at least 3 years .",
    "the scientific drivers for the survey ask for @xmath2 accuracy on the photometric scale , in absolute sense and between passbands ( see @xcite in this issue ) .",
    "this means that all systematic variations along the signal path ( atmosphere , telescope , instrument ) must be characterized to a fraction of that @xmath3 , consistently over the many years of survey operation .",
    "this includes for example paranal s atmospheric variability , observed to have peak - to - peak variations of up to @xmath4mag / airmass under clear sky conditions @xcite ; systematic changes in mirror reflectivity ( dusting ) , with typical rates of few tenths of magnitude per year and subtle variations in the system s electronic gain .",
    "omegacam and vst have been commissioned in 2011 @xcite .",
    "survey operations started october 15 , 2011 with the three surveys being performed in parallel .",
    "operations are based on a strict observing protocol for both calibrations and surveys .",
    "we use the astro - wise information system to monitor the calibration of the observatory and to produce and deliver the kilo degree survey .",
    "this paper presents the approach implemented in astro - wise for photometric monitoring omegacam to maximize the quality of its survey imaging products . in astro",
    "- wise , the homogeneous stream of data flowing from the instrument s calibration plan is turned into pixeldata and metadata through which the full physical system of paranal s atmosphere + vst + omegacam is continuously monitored . the design of astro - wise has been tuned explicitly to have survey production take advantage dynamically and very much automatically of increases in calibration accuracy and improved insight of the physical system from long - term trend analyses . in other words ,",
    "the information loop between calibrating an instrument and calibrating survey data is closed inside the astro - wise system .",
    "the paper is ordered as follows .",
    "we start out by describing the omegacam instrument in its commissioned form in section  [ s : omegacamatvst ] .",
    "we give an overview of omegacam s dataflow ( section  [ s : dataflow ] ) .",
    "we then present the photometric calibration plan ( section  [ s : calibrationplan ] ) and the conceptual approach in astro - wise for photometric monitoring based on this plan ( section  [ s : monitoringinastrowise ] ) .",
    "this is combined with preliminary results of omegacam s photometric behavior in the first @xmath56 months of operations .",
    "we end with conclusions and outlook ( section  [ s : conclusionsandoutlook ] ) .",
    "the vlt survey telescope and omegacam have both been designed specifically to have ( i ) the stability to produce homogeneous surveys with long - term observational programs and ( ii ) image quality as one of the major scientific strengths .",
    "the vlt survey telescope @xcite is of modified ritchey - cretien design and has an alt - az mount .",
    "the vst telescope can work in two configurations . in the standard configuration a two - lens field corrector",
    "for very large zenith distances the second configuration replaces this corrector with one including an atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) , consisting of one lens and two counter - rotating prism pairs .",
    "the operating wavelength ranges are 320 - 1014 nm and 365 - 1014 nm for the two - lens corrector and corrector + adc respectively .",
    "the vst has active primary and secondary mirrors ( figure  [ f : vstfromabove ] ) .",
    "omegacam is mounted at the cassegrain focus ( figure  [ f : vstfrombelow ] ) .",
    "the optical parts located in the instrument are the filters , and the dewar window to the cryostat , which doubles as a field lens ( figure  [ f : omegacamschematicoverview ] ) . in front of the dewar window",
    "is the mechanical part of omegacam : closest to the window sits the filter exchange mechanism , and above that the shutter .",
    "the housing provides the mechanical link between the telescope and the detector / cryostat system .",
    "omegacam is a 268 megapixel camera with a 1 square degree fov .",
    "the optical design of the camera has little aberration over the full field and a constant 0.21  plate scale .",
    "wavefront sensing is done in omegacam .",
    "the wavefront sensors work by registering star images that are significantly out of focus : the two auxiliary ccds are mounted out of the focal plane , one 2 mm above and one 2 mm below .",
    "the resulting psf is observed to equal the atmospheric seeing down to 0.6  over the full fov .",
    "paranal offers such excellent seeing much of the time ( a 50 % fractile of 0.66  fwhm ) .",
    "the vst enclosure houses an in - dome photometric calibration unit .",
    "it consists of two sets of 4 lamps each .",
    "they are commercial 12 - 24v halogen lamps mounted on the trusses on which the secondary mounting rests ( figure  [ f : vstfromabove ] ) .",
    "the lamps illuminate a dome screen , that is located on the inside of the enclosure near zenith .",
    "each set is operated independently and is using a stabilized current supply , one unit per set .",
    "lamps are switched on / off with a gradual increase / decrease of the current over a timespan of 3 - 5 minutes .",
    "lamp intensity variations are observed to be smaller than 1% over a month ( see section  [ s : monitoringinastrowise ] ) .",
    "the two sets are operated at different rates , one set @xmath6 hour / day the other set at @xmath6 hour / week .",
    "this ensures continuous calibration coverage .",
    "the calibration unit serves as an internal standard candle for a range of instrument monitoring and calibration activities .",
    "dome screen observations are used to perform a daily overall `` quick health check '' , to measure pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , to measure ccd linearity and to check shutter timing accuracy .",
    "the exposure shutter covers an aperture size of 370@xmath7292 mm .",
    "it consists of two carbon fiber blades .",
    "they are driven by 2 micro - stepper motors and move smoothly .",
    "these movements are controlled such that each individual ccd pixel ` sees ' the opening edge of the one blade and the closing edge of the other blade with an identical time difference , even if the blades are still accelerating .",
    "this provides an impact - free , high - accuracy photometric shutter . commissioning tests",
    "have shown that for an exposure time of 0.2sec / 1sec , deviations from a homogeneous exposure are below 2% / 0.2% over the whole field of view .",
    "this is based on observed variation in the flux level ratio between domeflat exposures as a function of position in the detector mosaic ( figure  [ f : shuttercheck ] ) .",
    "the domeflats are taken under identical conditions , but with short and long exposure times .",
    "this gives an upper limit to photometric effect of shutter motion inhomogeneity as several other sources contribute to variations in flux level ratio ( e.g. , calibration unit photometric variations , non - linear behavior of detectors ) .",
    "the systematics in the plots , discrete jumps from one ccd to another , are dominated by the non - linearity of the detectors .",
    ", width=377 ]      the filters are stored in two magazines which can move up and down on either side of the focal plane , through large shafts in the housing ( figure  [ f : omegacamschematicoverview ] ) .",
    "a linear stage slides filters into the beam , where they are locked into place by means of movable notches . the total number of motors used in the filter exchange and positioning mechanism is seven .",
    "commissioning tests verify that the precision of filter positioning is good .",
    "variations in photometry due to optical imperfections in the filters are less than 0.3% over @xmath8 months of operations .",
    "this has been verified for the u , g , r and i filter .",
    "the conclusion is based on inspection of ratios in flux level of domeflats observed over timescales of months .",
    "the long - term monitoring of domeflats is presented in section  [ s : domeflatfielding ] and results are shown also in figure  [ f : domeflat ] . to minimize operational overhead time",
    "the filter exchange unit is built in such a way that it allows one filter to be pulled into the beam while the previous one is pushed out .",
    "the filters are large and heavy : when fully loaded with 12 filters , the instrument contains 40 kg of filter glass alone ! during the filter exchange process",
    "about 17 kg are moved ( mass of 2 filters and the carriage ) .",
    "the primary filter set of omegacam are sloan u , g , r , i and z filters .",
    "in addition , there are johnson b and v filters for stellar work and for cross - calibrating the photometric systems , a stromgren v filter , an h@xmath9 filter consisting of 4 segments with redshifts of up to 10000km / sec , and a segmented ugri filter for efficient photometric monitoring of the sky .",
    "filters have been manufactured by sagem in paris , and by barr associates in massachusetts , and consist of 3-layer sandwiches of coloured or coated glass plates .",
    "the sloan filters are interference filters .",
    "figure  [ f : omegacamtransmissioncurves ] shows transmission curves for the sloan filters .",
    "the omegacam optical ccd imaging camera consists of a science array of 32 2k x 4k e2v 44 - 82 devices for a total area of 16384 x 16384 15@xmath10 pixels , corresponding to 26x26 cm ( figure  [ f : layoutomegacamdetectors ] ) .",
    "the ccds are thinned and low - noise ( 5e@xmath11 read - out noise ) .",
    "they are 3-edge buttable and cover the 1x1 square degree field of view of the vst with small gaps ( 25-85  ) and have a pixelsize of 0.21 arcsec / pixel . around this science array lie four ` auxiliary ccds ' , of the same format .",
    "the mosaic has been built at eso s headquarters in garching .",
    "the whole detector system is shown in figure  [ f : omegacamfrontview ] .",
    "two of the auxiliary ccds , on opposite sides of the science array , are used for auto - guiding using a guide star .",
    "the field is so large that also field rotation is auto - guided .",
    "the other two ccds are used for wavefront sensing using real - time image analysis .",
    "the daily output of omegacam is currently @xmath12gbyte of raw imaging data on average , corresponding to 140 exposures .",
    "this includes day and night - time calibration and science exposures .",
    "this data stream of over 2 terabyte per month is automatically pulled into the astro - wise data handling system , situated approximately 11250 kilometers from the imager .",
    "omegacam data is transferred by eso from paranal observatory , chile to headquarters in garching , germany using evalso @xcite . from there data",
    "is pulled automatically to the astro - wise node in groningen via monitoring ( using wget in mirror mode ) .",
    "the nature of the data ( bias , science , twilight , etc ... ) is determined from header inspection of fits format data in groningen .",
    "this also intercepts data not to be ingested in astro - wise ( e.g. , focus runs ) .",
    "pixel data is then decompressed .",
    "the new raw data triggers ingestion into astro - wise : pixel data is stored on dataservers and metadata ( i.e. , non - pixel data ) in the database ( see @xcite for details ) and an initial rough quality assessment is automatically performed . via this retrieval approach",
    "we have succeeded in having omegacam data available for processing in astro - wise as fast as 1 hour after its observation .",
    "a week s worth of calibration data is processed and quality assessed by a single calibration scientist in about 1 day . for the kids science data , a quick look pipeline monitors for new raw data and automatically produces coadded calibrated images .",
    "latest instead of default calibrations are automatically used if available . at the astro - wise node in groningen",
    "we have achieved production of up to 70 square degrees of coadded calibrated science images in 24 hours .",
    "swift transport and ingestion of new data in astro - wise is important for instrument monitoring and survey efficiency .",
    "every week of delay in noticing degradation of nightly data quality and/or instrument performance corresponds to a loss of @xmath13 for a survey per year .",
    "the science yield and rate is also enlarged by fast production and analysis of end - products . for the omegacam kids survey for example",

    "the stars indicate at which frequency the measurement is done . for further details , see text.,width=377 ]",
    "the photometric calibration plan of omegacam is designed to provide a continuous photometric characterization of the survey system . a schematic overview of omegacam s photometric calibration plan is shown in figure  [ f : calibrationplan ] .",
    "the types of observations allow to establish the photometric scale of the omegacam+vst system and atmosphere separately and the observational cadences should allow continuous monitoring , i.e. , sample the expected timescales of variations .",
    "the system is monitored using the calibration unit with a daily ( _ quick check _ ) and weekly ( _ dome flat - field _ ) frequency .",
    "these observations are the input to determine the stability and systematic photometric behavior of omegacam+vst system . on - sky observations",
    "monitor the system plus atmosphere , using fixed fields with frequencies of three - per - night ( _ monitoring _ ) , nightly / weekly ( _ zeropoint_,_twilight flatfield _ ) and monthly or longer ( _ user@xmath14key _ , _ illum .",
    "thus the photometric behavior of the atmosphere as a function of time can be deduced from the combination of on - sky and in - dome observations .",
    "we use the astro - wise information system to handle the observations from the omegacam photometric calibration plan . a major design goal of astro - wise has been to have public survey production take advantage dynamically and very much automatically of improved calibration accuracy and improved insight of the physical system inferred from long - term monitoring using observations from the photometric calibration plan . in other words",
    ", we have closed the information loop between calibrating an instrument and calibrating a survey inside a single system of information .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite ( this volume ) and @xcite for a comprehensive description of this astro - wise design .",
    "the approach taken in astro - wise is to map the calibrational requirements ( to be achieved by the calibration plan ) to a data model .",
    "the data model is a map that describes for each calibration requirement which information it needs as input to be tested .",
    "this information is expressed as products from types of observations of the calibration plan . in other words ,",
    "the data model maps which type of observations are needed to construct the desired information .",
    "this mapping is a cascade from final products back to the initial raw observations taken for the calibration plan ( see figure  [ f : targetdiagram ] ) .",
    "the data model is conceptual : it does not fix the content of a method , e.g. , the algorithm , to make each step in this cascade .",
    "this conceptual data model is implemented as an object model .",
    "this means that each photometric requirement has a corresponding class or classes ( e.g. , _",
    "@xmath14 photometricparameters , _ monitoring _ @xmath14 atmosphericextinctioncoefficients ) .",
    "the classes aggregate the information required to test the requirement .",
    "objects are specific instantiations of classes .",
    "for example , each set of exposures that represent a component of the calibration plan ( i.e. , observing blocks in eso speak ) is represented as one object .",
    "objects can contain both meta - data and ( processed ) pixel data .",
    "meta - data is defined as all non - pixel data : e.g. , observational metadata , processing configurations , image statistics and quality assessment parameters .",
    "the objects have links to their dependencies recursively , where dependencies are other objects on which it depends for information input .",
    "thus , objects representing final survey products can be traced back to their set of raw data dependencies from which they are ultimately derived .",
    "this is the concept that eventually links requirements on calibrational accuracy in the calibration plan to attributes of objects stored in the astro - wise database .",
    "trend plots of these attributes as function of time , any other attribute of the object , or any attribute of its dependencies is the basis of quality assessment and control .",
    "the python language is used to implement the object model    in essence , astro - wise is an integrated information accumulator for survey data handling .",
    "not a pipeline feeding a separate archive feeding a separate set of data analysis tools .",
    "it keeps the cycle processing@xmath14 archiving @xmath14 in - depth monitoring analysis around the pool of data ( observational pixels and metadata ) in a single system .",
    "analysis by survey team members and calibration scientists on the data results in an improved understanding of the instrument and how it should be calibrated .",
    "changing methods is one way in which this improved knowledge can be captured by astro - wise .",
    "this does not alter the object model . by applying the improved knowledge (",
    "i.e. , reprocessing ) the next cycle starts to increase the level of detail to which the instrument plus the processing of its information is understood .",

    "figure  [ f : quickcheck ] shows the trend of raw detector levels over one and ten months for one ccd .",
    "it implies that the photometric scale of the calibration unit varies almost linear on timescale of a month with a more complex behavior on timescale of several months .",
    "the repeatability of the measurement on a monthly scale corresponds to @xmath5 2 - 5 mmag per ccd on the system photometric scale for most ccds .",
    "similarity across chip and filters of residuals to the mean exposure level suggests variability of the lamp is the dominatant source of scatter for most chips .",
    "two ccds show a larger scatter ( see figure  [ f : quickcheckscatter ] ) .",
    "these two deviations must originate within electronics specific to these detectors .",
    "previously , ccd#82 showed a larger variation .",

    "further contributions can come from systematics in the reference catalog ( sdss was used here ) and the applied illumination correction .",
    "the hourly scatter in the on - sky photometric scale per ccd is @xmath52 -7 times larger than the monthly scatter observed for the in - dome photometric scale .",
    "a lower - limit to how well we can measure the photometric scale is given by the zeropoint measurement precision .",
    "table  [ t : photometricscale ] shows that the current precision of the on - sky measurement is 1 - 3 times larger than the monthly in - dome scatter .",
    "the on - sky measurement can be improved by improving the standard catalog ( sdss dr8 catalogs in the sa fields at the moment ) and improving the source extraction ( aperture magnitudes with fixed 6.4 arcsec diameter , regardless of seeing ) . in conclusion",
    ", the best zpt per - chip at any time can be obtained using in - dome observations with the calibration unit . however",

    "first , they are used to measure the stability of the nightly atmospheric extinction .",
    "this is done by combining information from the zeropoints observations on sa fields and assuming standard atmospheric extinction coefficients .",
    "thus it is possible to determine 3/night the actual atmospheric extinction compared to photometric conditions ( figure  [ f : polarfield ] ) .",
    "second , the observations are used to measure skybrightness .",
    "again these can be compared to expected values under photometric conditions for given lunar phase / distance .",
    "long - term monitoring of both the atmospheric extinction results and sky brightness results can yield deeper understanding in the physics setting the atmospheric extinction ( dust , aerosols , water vapor etcetera ) .",
    "eventually , this should lead to survey calibrations without the need to assume default atmospheric extinction coefficients .    as the maximum difference in airmass is 8% between any two polar field observations it directly measures changes in the atmospheric extinction coefficient at fixed high airmass to this accuracy .",
    "similarly , comparison of overlapping sources in dithered science observations measure changes in atmospheric extinction coefficients at fixed lower airmasses",
    ". results from sections  [ s : indome ] and [ s : onsky ] show that the zeropoint zpt could be constrained independently by combining information from quick health and zeropoints observations .",
    "the combination of information from sa fields ( zeropoints ) at typical airmass@xmath28 and polar field ( atmospheric monitoring ) at airmass@xmath29 can then constrain the behavior of the atmospheric extinction coefficient k as a function of time from a nice baseline in airmass .",
    "commissioning analysis has shown that twilight and dome flat exposures with omegacam are both subjected to non - uniform illumination .",
    "thus , the derivation of a true flatfield ( i.e. , only the variation in pixel sensitivity ) requires a correction of these illumination variations .",
    "this is termed illumination correction .",
    "here we give a summary .",
    "if no correction for these illumination variations is applied the photometric scale residual can vary by up to @xmath30 mag , bottom - to - peak within a single chip ( figure  [ f : illumvariations ] ) .",
    "the large - scale residual pattern appears roughly point symmetric around the center of the mosaic . a variation in the stray light distribution which is point symmetric around the optical axis to",
    "first order can cause this .",
    "other instruments show similar illumination variations patterns , i.e. , having a central - axisymmetric 2d - polynomial shape , for example , wfi @xcite and  @xcite and megacam  @xcite .",
    "in addition there are localized components , especially near the covers over the detector heads .",
    "finally , commissioning analysis has shown a dependency on the rotator angle between the camera and the telescope . from trend analysis on @xmath55 months of weekly dome flats and",
    "twilight flats the conclusion is that the intrinsic flat field ( i.e. , pixel sensitivities ) varies with a @xmath31 or less .",
    "therefore it was decided to build a single masterflat from a combination of a single twilight flat and single dome flat for the sloan g , r , i and z filters and apply this to all omegacam observations used to determine the illumination correction .",
    "the usage of a single flat ( i.e. , at single rotator angle ) simplifies the procedure : a single illumination correction needs to be derived .    to characterize the illumination variations sa fields",
    "were observed at @xmath5 33 dither positions .",
    "these dither positions are mostly single - chip offsets such that a group of stars is observed on all 32 ccds .",
    "zeropoints per chip are computed and the magnitude residuals , i.e. , the difference between the zeropoint and reference magnitude , sample the illumination variations .",
    "the combined sa fields , yield roughly 1000 useful magnitude residuals per chip for g , r , i , z and about 500 for the u - band .",
    "the residuals are modelled as a continuous locally linear model using adaptive binning and interpolation .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ t : illuminationcorrection ] and shown in figure  [ f : illuminationcorrection ] .",
    ".*illumination correction results*. standard deviations of residual magnitudes in the five sloan filters left after applying the localized illumination corrections . the internal and external standard deviation ( sd ) of the magnitude residuals are defined as follows : external is with respect to the stellar reference magnitude in the standard star catalog ( sdss dr7 stellar photometry ) .",
    "internal is w.r.t .",
    "the mean of its observed magnitudes .",
    "2nd and 3rd column : sd of internal and external errors if only zero points are applied ; 4th and 5th columns : sd of internal and external errors when illumination correction applied on omegacam kids survey data ( sa fields for z band ) . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     ) .",
    "bottom : the resulting illumination correction pixelframe as applied in the photometric data processing.,width=253 ]    the illumination correction is characterized to better than 1% for the amplitude over a single ccd .",
    "the correction method overcomes the rotator angle dependence by virtue of the stability of the intrinsic ( `` true '' ) flatfield .",
    "this illumination correction has remained accurate on timescales of at least 7 months of omegacam survey operations ( including a vst technical intervention ) .",
    "the illumination correction approach here can account for the sub - percent changes in pixel - to - pixel sensitivity over time .",
    "this can be done by updating the domeflat because it sets the small - scale structure in the masterflat .",
    "the observed flatfield and the illumination correction derived for it form a multiplicative pair .",
    "together they describe the true pixel sensitivity over the field .",
    "the multiplication procedure does not remove the additive component of straylight itself .",
    "in other words , the correction should be applied to sources that are small compared to the scale over which variation in straylight strength is significant .",
    "sources with more extended surface brightness distributions on scales of a ccd or larger in science exposures are still contaminated by straylight . in this case",
    "a combination of a global illumination correction plus local background fitting appears able to remove the straylight contamination @xcite .",
    "if no such dedicated correction is applied the extended surface brightness distributions are affected systematically up to 0.04mag for typical cases .",
    "similar to flatfielding and zeropoints the illumination correction is represented in the astro - wise data model .",
    "the illuminationcorrection is the object model implementation of the _ illuminationcorrection _ component in the calibration plan .",
    "omegacam at the vst has been commissioned successfully , meeting specifications and started science operations october 15 , 2011 .",
    "the continuous flow of observations from omegacam s photometric calibration plan are being processed in astro - wise .",
    "astro - wise is also used for photometric monitoring and analyses .",
    "the first half a year of photometric calibrations yield the following preliminary results :    * the on - sky measurements with omegacam achieve 10mmag precision in sampling the photometric scale of omegacam+vst+atmosphere . * the in - dome photometric scale of detector + calibration unit is stable over a month to within @xmath55mmag for @xmath590% of the detectors . *",
    "master domeflat variations over 6 months of operations constrain the relative pixel - to - pixel responses to be constant to a level of 1 - 1.5mmag . * measuring the vst+omegacam response with in - dome observations ( domeflats ) can be done with @xmath52 - 5 times higher precision than with on - sky observations ( standard fields ) .",
    "first results give hope that by combining the results from in - dome and on - sky observations we can model variations in the atmospheric extinctions coefficients very accurately .",
    "the astro - wise system is also being used also to handle the kilo degree survey .",
    "observing conditions are partially non - photometric .",
    "the goal of our omegacam photometric calibration is to reach photometric homogeneity to 1% accuracy per filter and between filters .",
    "kids observes 1500 square degrees of sky in two patches .",
    "the area is tiled with @xmath51 square degree observations that have some overlap .",
    "the tiling is identical for each filter .",
    "these tiles are constructed per filter from an @xmath32 hour observing block of dithered observations , 4 in u and 5 in g , r and i. this survey design yields constraints on variations in photometric scale in several ways .",
    "variations in the photometric scale on the hour scale are sampled by dither - to - dither comparisons within an observing block .",
    "the overlaps between kids tiles provide intra - night and inter - night constraints .",
    "the atlas public survey running in parallel on omegacam at the vst covers kids survey area in the same filters to a shallower depth , using a different tiling .",
    "the overlaps within kids and between kids and atlas provide therefore additional mostly inter - night constraints . exploiting these constraints to improve survey",
    "photometric homogenization is an on - going effort .",
    "it is the combination of the total volume of photometric information over years of calibrations of omegacam and survey observations of kids and atlas that can lead to an internally consistent continuous description of the observatory s photometric scale to the best accuracy .",
    "the astro - wise system design is aimed specifically at combining such large volumes of complex information dynamically , improving the solution as science and calibration observations progress and new information accumulates in astro - wise .",
    "the omegacam consortium was formed in response to an announcement of opportunity from eso , and comprises institutes in the netherlands ( nova , in particular the kapteyn institute groningen and leiden observatory ) , germany ( in particular university observatories of munich , gottingen and bonn ) and italy ( inaf , in particular padua and naples observatories ) . the eso optical detector team designed and built the detector system .",
