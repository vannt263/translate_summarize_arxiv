    "a standard model for forming the terrestrial planets has emerged , and is divided broadly into three stages ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "the first stage is poorly understood , but the formation of the sun is thought to leave a large but thin protoplanetary disc of both gas and solids , with coagulation or gravitational instability producing rocky objects ( ` planetesimals ' ) in the metre - to - km size range . in the second stage , interactions between the planetesimals result in an early phase of ` runaway growth ' , to be discussed below , where the single largest body in a given region breaks away from the mass spectrum and becomes significantly larger than the second - largest . over @xmath4 years , this gives rise to an oligarchic phase , also discussed below , which produces many well - spaced comparable - mass embryos . in the third stage ,",
    "the embryos interact with each other and what remains of the the disc , merging and producing the terrestrial planets we observe today on a timescale of @xmath5 years .    the basic paradigm for the second stage , the ` planetesimal problem ' , is described in @xcite .",
    "one considers a very large number of small bodies of comparable mass , moving in low - eccentricity , low - inclination orbits around the sun .",
    "these objects will suffer close encounters with each other , changing the velocity distribution , and occasionally collide and either merge or fragment , changing the mass spectrum as well .",
    "energy equipartition in the system decreases the random velocities of the larger bodies , and increases the velocities of the smaller ones , an effect known as ` dynamical friction ' .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that dynamical friction leads to runaway growth of the largest body , as the decrease in velocity increases the collisional cross section and thus the accretion rate .",
    "later simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) confirmed this , and demonstrated that the end result of runaway growth was an ` oligarchic ' phase where the accretion process is dominated by the gravitational stirring of well - separated embryos of roughly equal masses .",
    "all simulations published to date of the second stage have either neglected any interaction between the gas disk and the solid bodies or have included only the aerodynamic gas drag acting on the solid bodies as described by @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the interactions between the protoplanetary disc and the protoplanets can also cause the latter to migrate .",
    "this can happen in several ways : type i , where the migration is driven by the asymmetry between the torques generated by the interior and exterior wakes of the body @xcite ; type ii , where the protoplanet is large enough to open up a gap in the disc , coupling it to the viscous evolution of the disc @xcite ; and recently type iii @xcite , a very fast migration mode which occurs when the embryo begins to migrate quickly enough that corotating material can not librate .",
    "( the solid material in the disc can also be scattered by the embryos , leading to embryo migration directly ; this ` type 0 ' migration @xcite is thought to play an important role in the evolution of the outer solar system . )    in most models , protoplanets of terrestrial mass are incapable of opening a gap and therefore do not suffer type ii migration , and likewise type iii should not be relevant @xcite .",
    "accordingly we restrict ourselves to considering the effects of type i migration , specifically the tidal interactions between the planet and disc which result in semimajor axis decay and random velocity decay ( both eccentricity and inclination damping . ) in the models we are considering , the typical effect is to decrease the semimajor axis , which leads to difficulties for accretion : the type i migration rate scales with the mass of the object , so as an object grows it moves inwards faster .",
    "indeed , the type i migration timescales for the embryos produced near 1 au are typically comparable to the timescales for their growth ; this problem is discussed in @xcite .    in a sense , we seek to refine the initial conditions for the third stage , by including the effects of the tidal interaction during the second stage .",
    "this is very similar in spirit to @xcite , but they include only the effects of random velocity damping , not of semimajor axis decay , and study only the third stage itself .",
    "to this end we will investigate the effects of different assumptions about the disc and the migration efficiency on the state of the protoplanetary system when the gas vanishes , and thus our ability to produce terrestrial planets from what material remains .",
    "note that we concentrate here on forming the earth and venus .",
    "mercury has a small enough mass ( @xmath6 ) that it is easily considered debris at this scale , and the problem of forming mars has its own special difficulties involving the asteroid belt , the possible presence of other large embryos , and influences from jupiter , which we defer .",
    "we will not discuss here the third stage resulting from this work , because it is probably dependent on the details of the stirring of the embryos near the end of the second stage .",
    "this is likely to involve the perturbations introduced by the formation of jupiter and saturn , for which models are sufficiently uncertain that we reserve a discussion of these effects for a subsequent paper .    in ",
    "[ section : model ] we develop a semi - analytic model for oligarchy during type i migration in the terrestrial region and use the results to motivate the n - body simulations which follow . in ",
    "[ section : nbody_methods ] we discuss our numerical n - body methods , and present the results of our n - body simulations in  [ section : sims ] .",
    "section [ section : disc ] contains a further discussion of our scenario and we summarize our conclusions in  [ section : conc ] .",
    "in this section we construct a model of oligarchic formation by adapting the model of @xcite , which built on the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "we content ourselves with summarizing their results and noting our modifications .",
    "we then discuss the differences between the physics in this semi - analytic model and the physics we use in our n - body simulations .",
    "we use the semi - analytic model for two distinct purposes : first , to provide a quick way to explore parameter space and determine what regimes are good candidates for more detailed n - body investigation ; and second , to generate initial conditions for said n - body simulations .",
    "this allows us to begin our runs later in the process than would otherwise be possible , thereby avoiding the expense of handling very large numbers of embryos at early times .",
    "@xcite represent the oligarchic system by a two - component model consisting of embryos and field planetesimals , where the former accrete but the latter do not .",
    "the model variables are the embryo mass @xmath7 and planetesimal surface density @xmath8 as functions of semimajor axis @xmath9 , and we seek to evolve @xmath10 and @xmath11 over time @xmath12",
    ".    note that since @xmath10 is continuous but is meant to represent a discrete population , it corresponds not to the mass of material in the form of embryos in a given region , but to the mass that an embryo would have were one present at that semimajor axis .",
    "it is also assumed that the embryo separation @xmath13 measured in single - planet hill units ( defined by @xmath14 ) is constant and contains all the information about the effects of any embryo - embryo mergers in the model .",
    "this assumption is justified in @xcite as the consequence of an equilibration between the decrease in @xmath13 caused by accretion of small objects and an increase in @xmath13 caused by two - body scattering followed by eccentricity damping due to dynamical friction from the field of planetesimals .",
    "the properties of the resulting ( non - continuous ) embryo population can be determined from @xmath10 by discretizing the curve appropriately .",
    "thus we construct an effective embryo surface density @xmath15 , setting the embryo spacing @xmath16 .",
    "the embryos are assumed to have uniform physical density @xmath17 .",
    "it is also assumed that the embryos are kept in near - circular orbits by dynamical friction with the field ( or , when active , tidal damping from the gas ) and therefore the important random velocity is that of the field particles .    the field population is similarly approximated as being comprised of planetesimals of uniform mass @xmath18 and density @xmath19 ( and therefore uniform radius @xmath20 ) with ( root - mean - square ) eccentricity @xmath21 and inclination @xmath22 satisfying @xmath23 . @xcite",
    "determine the eccentricity , after @xcite , by equating the stirring timescale of the field by the embryos with the damping timescale due to aerodynamic drag on the field particles .",
    "the stirring timescale in a dispersion - dominated regime can be written as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant and @xmath26 the orbital frequency .",
    "we use the damping timescale due to aerodynamic drag from @xcite , where @xmath27 is the density of the gas and @xmath28 is a drag efficiency factor ( @xmath29 ) dependent upon the reynolds number of the disc .",
    "we neglect resonant interactions . in our notation ,",
    "@xmath30    equating these two timescales yields an equilibrium eccentricity of @xmath31    @xcite derive an expression for the growth of the embryo mass @xmath32    and a corresponding decrease in planetesimal surface density from conservation of mass @xmath33    ( the aerodynamic drag also affects @xmath34 , as we discuss later . )",
    "we restrict consideration of initial disc conditions at @xmath35 to those resembling the minimum mass model @xcite .",
    "specifically , we assume the surface density in solids has the form @xmath36 ; the nominal values are @xmath37 and we introduce an enhancement factor @xmath38 so that @xmath39 . we adopt a gas - to - solid ratio of 240 , so that @xmath40 .",
    "we assume the disc has an exponential vertical structure such that @xmath41 , with @xmath42 taken at the midplane and @xmath43 the disc half - thickness .",
    "( integrating the z - dependent term over all @xmath44 gives the relation @xmath45 . )",
    "the half - thickness varies as @xmath46 , where we take the thickness at 1 au to be @xmath47 .",
    "we model the dissipation of the gas by introducing an exponential decay with a characteristic time @xmath48 which is fixed for a given model and does not vary through the disc , @xmath49 , where we allow @xmath50 .",
    "we define a parameter @xmath51 which measures the degree of pressure support of the disc ( and thus deviations of circular orbits from keplerian velocity ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 ; typically @xmath55 .",
    "we assume the gas is in cylindrical rotation such that @xmath56 .    for the planetesimal migration introduced by aerodynamic drag",
    ", we adopt the orbit - averaged approximation valid for small @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath51 due to @xcite :    @xmath59    we also add a prescription for type i migration based on that of @xcite , assuming that the embryos are on circular orbits ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they derive a timescale for semimajor axis damping @xmath60 :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is a migration efficiency parameter , with @xmath63 being nominal and @xmath64 yielding @xmath65 . by varying @xmath62 in our simulations",
    "we can account for an uncertainty of order unity in the rate of migration .    for the purpose of this model we can construct a rough radial velocity for protoplanet material    @xmath66    we emphasize that since it is not clear ( to choose one assumption among many ) whether the aerodynamic drag coefficient @xmath28 should be @xmath671 or @xmath672 @xcite , the above model is only expected to be accurate to within factors of order unity .",
    "this is true even if we neglect consequences of assuming that all field particles have the same fixed mass and the issue of the evolution of inter - embryo spacing ( see  [ bevol ] ) .",
    "we now integrate the model described in the previous section forward in time .",
    "we have two variables , the embryo mass @xmath10 and the planetesimal surface density @xmath68 , whose evolution ( in the absence of aerodynamic or tidal migration ) is specified by equations ( [ eq : dmdt ] ) and ( [ eq : dsdt ] ) .",
    "we introduce migration through equations ( [ eq : v_aero ] ) , ( [ eq : ta_semianal ] ) , and ( [ eq : v_m ] ) .",
    "these five equations are simultaneously integrated across a zone from @xmath69 0.2 au to @xmath69 5.0 au , subject to our time - dependent gas profile .",
    "figure [ figure : ed_1 ] shows the evolution of the standard minimum - mass model ( k = 7.1 @xmath70 , @xmath71 , p = -1.5 , @xmath72 ) assuming that @xmath73 .",
    "we arbitrarily set @xmath74 as the seed mass for the embryos at all @xmath9 , so that the total fraction of mass in embryos is @xmath75 that of the mass in the planetesimal field ; accretion at early times is so quick that the precise value is unimportant as long as @xmath76 .",
    "as is evident on the left part of the curves , the embryo mass nearly asymptotes toward a power - law in semimajor axis @xmath9 : except for deviations introduced by planetesimal migration and the nonzero initial mass @xmath77 of the embryo , the limiting mass is set solely by the amount of planetesimal material and the chosen @xmath13 , @xmath78 .",
    "( the right side of the curve will reach the same asymptote eventually . )",
    "figure [ figure : ed_2 ] shows the minimum - mass model with tidal migration added ( keeping @xmath72 ) : several differences from the previous case are immediately apparent . the maximum embryo mass is substantially reduced , from @xmath79 at 10 myr to @xmath80 . without migration there is a sharp drop - off in embryo mass past the peak of the accretion front , but with tidal migration there is a wide band in semimajor axis where the embryo mass is within 25% of the maximum .",
    "with @xmath50 there is nothing to prevent embryo material from continuing to migrate inwards as it accretes , and thus eventually all embryo mass falls into the sun .",
    "figure [ figure : ed_3 ] is the result of introducing gas dissipation of @xmath48 = 1 myr , which produces an intermediate system .",
    "the maximum embryo mass reached is @xmath81 , down by a factor of 2 from the no - migration case , but the gas decay has several effects : type i migration is halted , preserving embryo mass ; the increase in planetesimal eccentricity as a result of the decrease in aerodynamic drag increases the accretion time ; and as a result of this increase , a fair amount of material is left in the form of planetesimals .",
    "however , the total amount of material in the terrestrial region ( @xmath82 ) is insufficient to later accrete into the earth and venus during stage three .",
    "the dissipation timescale of @xmath83 myr was chosen based on studies of the disc lifetimes around stars in young clusters by @xcite .",
    "they find that roughly half the stars lose their discs in @xmath84 myr , and the overall disc lifetime was @xmath85 myr .",
    "( in the n - body simulations to be discussed later , we will consider discs with both larger and greater @xmath48 . )",
    "this suggests that in order to obtain the appropriate amount of material in the terrestrial region with nominal migration , one could ( 1 ) introduce a dissipating disc and ( 2 ) enhance the disc above the minimum mass model .",
    "figure [ figure : ed_4 ] compares the end state after 100 myr of evolution for the minimum mass model with various @xmath48 values with the same for a disc enhanced by a factor of three .",
    "the enhanced case both moves the point of maximum embryo mass outwards and raises the maximum mass reached by almost a factor of @xmath86 , but is otherwise qualitatively similar to the minimum mass results . from this and other runs ( not shown )",
    "we conclude that if we believe the nominal migration rates , then to within the expected reliability of the model , disc enhancements of a factor of several and dissipation times of @xmath871 myr should suffice to keep enough prototerrestrial mass in the region .",
    "unfortunately these analytic models are sufficiently simplified that they miss many interesting dynamical interactions and so can not predict the detailed behaviour of the embryos .",
    "this is especially true at the later stages when the embryo eccentricities are no longer being damped by the gas .",
    "the assumption that @xmath88 also breaks down ( see  [ bevol ] ) as the embryo mass increases , and therefore semi - analytic estimates of the mass in embryos remaining at myr timescales may be unreliable .",
    "we therefore want to construct n - body realizations of these models and integrate them directly , as we discuss next .      for consistency",
    ", we carry as much of the above approach as possible through to our n - body code .",
    "there are nevertheless modifications in both the aerodynamic and the tidal drag formulae .",
    "first , instead of the approximation for the aerodynamic drag in eq.([eq : v_aero ] ) , we consider the planetesimal migration induced by aerodynamic drag    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the cartesian velocity of the object , @xmath91 the velocity of the gas at the object s position , and @xmath92 is given by eq.([eq : tdamp ] ) .",
    "as before , we assume that @xmath56 .",
    "second , for the tidal drag , we use the full approach of @xcite , which the authors developed to handle the case where a protoplanet s eccentricity can be greater than the scale height - to - semimajor axis ratio .",
    "they derive timescales for semimajor axis damping @xmath60 and for eccentricity damping @xmath93 :    @xmath94    @xmath95    where ( as before ) @xmath62 is the migration efficiency , and @xmath96 is the analogous damping efficiency .",
    "they also argue that if the inclination damping timescale is not significantly shorter than the eccentricity damping timescale then it plays little role in the equilibrium state ; we set @xmath97 for simplicity . from these",
    "we can find the acceleration on an object due to tidal damping of semimajor axis and random velocity , namely @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath90 , and @xmath100 are cartesian position , velocity , and acceleration vectors , respectively ( with @xmath101 as the magnitude of the radial vector ) and @xmath102 is the unit vector in the vertical direction .    in the code",
    "( to be discussed in  [ section : nbody_methods ] ) , it is equations ( [ eq : v_m4nbod ] ) through ( [ eq : a ] ) which are used to incorporate the interaction between the embryos and planetesimals and the gas disc .",
    "we perform the numerical integrations using a parallel implementation of symba @xcite called miranda . symba is a mixed - variable symplectic integrator based on the n - body map of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which has been improved to accurately handle close encounters between particles .",
    "as is done in the analytic model , we consider two classes of object , embryos ( which gravitate and can accrete planetesimals ) and field planetesimals ( where we neglect all self - interactions . ) we have made several modifications to the original algorithm , mainly to include the effects of the gas disc . as introduced in ",
    "[ subsection : nbody_mod ] , both embryos and planetesimals suffer the aerodynamic drag of eq.([eq : v_m4nbod ] ) and the embryos further suffer semimajor axis decay and random velocity damping according to the prescriptions of ( [ eq : ta ] ) , ( [ eq : te ] ) , and ( [ eq : a ] ) . accelerations resulting from the gas disc are treated as operators surrounding the ( possibly recursively subdivided ) drift operator in the basic democratic heliocentric step @xcite after the manner of @xcite .",
    "however , in practice they are not applied during close encounters as the model for the gas density is almost certainly inapplicable in such situations , and we want to prevent artificial formation of tight binaries .",
    "note that we neglect the gravitational potential due to the gas disc .",
    "one important approximation made in our n - body treatment of the field is the use of ` super - planetesimals ' .",
    "that is , in representing the field by a discrete number of particles , we use a large mass @xmath103 for each object and imagine it represents an aggregate of underlying planetesimals of mass @xmath18 . the aerodynamic drag that the object feels",
    "is that which the underlying @xmath18-mass object would , but when a merger occurs the mass @xmath103 is used .",
    "thus the integrated field objects are serving as dynamical tracers .",
    "theoretical considerations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the accretion rate of an embryo embedded in a planetesimal field should depend only the product of the number density of the planetesimals and their mass , provided that the collision timescale is much shorter than the embryo growth timescale .",
    "numerical experiments varying the ratio @xmath104 over orders of magnitude confirm that the accretion is insensitive to the exact value of @xmath103 in our regime given that the characteristic embryo mass @xmath105 and the number of super - planetesimals is large .",
    "it remains true that as a consequence of this approximation , at early times when the ratio of typical embryo mass @xmath7 to @xmath103 is at its lowest , we are inaccurately treating the effects of dynamical friction .",
    "however , the embryos are on circular , non - inclined orbits in any event due to the strong tidal eccentricity damping , and the aerodynamic drag is damping the planetesimals random velocities , which suppresses the frictional stirring . as the drag becomes less effective due to the dissipation of the disc , the @xmath106 ratio quickly increases , thereby reducing the inaccuracy .",
    "we adopt as starting conditions @xmath107 ( where @xmath7 is the characteristic initial embryo mass ) .",
    "note that this differs from the approximation often made by kokubo and ida where they instead increase the accretion radius of their particles by a factor @xmath108 , thereby artificially speeding up their simulations by a factor @xmath109 for some @xmath110 $ ] ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume perfect accretion , which avoids the problem of collisional cascades ( and the resulting increase in particle number , catastrophic in a nonstatistical code ) at the cost of inaccuracy in the mass spectrum ; effects of this and other simplifications are discussed in  [ caveats ] .",
    "since computer power is limited , we wish to begin our integrations as late in the second stage as possible .",
    "we will use the semi - analytic model of  [ section : model ] to evolve the disc from our nominal t=0 start until the number of embryos ( i.e. the predicted number of embryos ; recall that @xmath10 is continuous ) is computationally tractable .",
    "this naturally produces a self - consistent gradient in embryo masses with the appropriate field population .",
    "we then discretize @xmath10 and @xmath68 , yielding a set of embryos and a large number of super - planetesimal field particles , typically @xmath111 ( subject to the constraints on mass discussed in the previous section ) , which constitute our n - body realization of the initial conditions for our simulations",
    ".    to be specific , we set embryo and planetesimal densities @xmath112 , and take the underlying physical planetesimal mass to be @xmath113 ( i.e. planetesimal radius @xmath20 = 100 km at 3.0 @xmath114 ) .",
    "we set the efficiencies of aerodynamic drag and tidal eccentricity damping to unity , @xmath115 , and set @xmath116 at 1 au .",
    "we take @xmath77 , the initial embryo mass at @xmath117 for the semi - analytic model , to be @xmath118 , which is much larger than @xmath18 but two orders of magnitude below the likely final values @xmath119 . by introducing this larger @xmath77",
    "we advance the evolution ( especially of the embryos at larger @xmath9 ) forward in time .",
    "this procedure is justifiable to the extent that the evolution we are bypassing is merely local accretion prior to any significant embryonic tidal migration .",
    "thus , embryos in a simulation starting with smaller embryonic seeds would largely ` catch up ' in mass to those in our simulations by the time significant migration sets in .",
    "we evolve this model until @xmath120 myr , which produces a satisfactory ( @xmath121 ) number of embryos , and is early enough that the use of a fixed @xmath13 of 10 is acceptable . in this early phase , the runaway growth timescale ( to return the system to oligarchy if the spacing is too large ) and the scattering timescale ( to do the same if the spacing is too small ) are both short .",
    "relaxation to the empirical equilibrium conditions begins almost immediately in the simulations , and we do not believe that our results are particularly sensitive to the fine details at the start .    from this @xmath120 myr frame , objects are constructed from @xmath122 = 0.75 au to @xmath123 2.5 au with embryo masses derived from @xmath10 ( objects placed inwards , from 0.50 au to 0.75 au , quickly fall off the inner edge of the simulation at 0.40 au . ) this sets the maximum mass of a field object @xmath103 ( see  [ section : nbody_methods ] ) and from @xmath68 the field objects can be built .",
    "initial eccentricities and inclinations for embryos are set to 0.001 and 0.0005 , respectively .",
    "planetesimal eccentricities are drawn from a rayleigh distribution of scale @xmath124 using eq.([eq : eccequil ] ) , and we enforce @xmath125 .",
    "( we observe that eq.([eq : eccequil ] ) consistently predicts an equilibrium eccentricity which is slightly larger than the value to which the simulations rapidly relax .",
    "experiments suggest that this is due to an overprediction of the stirring , whether the viscous or friction term , and not an underprediction of the effects of aerodynamic drag .",

    "all angles are randomized .",
    "as discussed above , the implications of the simplified models of  [ section : model ] are that to preserve sufficient mass we will need to increase the surface density , and therefore ( keeping in mind possible enhancements in the outer solar system ) we focus on discs @xmath126 to 4 times the minimum mass disc .",
    "specifications of the resulting conditions are summarized in table [ table : sim1 ] .",
    "we use values for @xmath48 of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 2.0 myr , and migration efficiency @xmath62 of 0.25 , 0.50 , and 1.00 . for concreteness",

    "one such wing is apparent interior to the embryo near 0.7 au in fig.[figure : c2_3 ] , where the jacobi wing has swept up a considerable amount of mass ( @xmath142 ) during migration .    at this time",
    ", @xmath143 of material has been removed from the simulation for approaching the sun too closely ( 0.4 au being the limit ) . ultimately @xmath144 will be removed , and 90% of this is accomplished by 3 myr .",
    "the probable fate of the removed material is discussed further in  [ section : weiden ] ; there are good reasons to believe that most of the material which escapes makes it to the solar surface . with migration , in order to leave enough mass in the terrestrial region , it becomes necessary to make a substantial sacrifice to the sun .    at 2 myr , in figure [",
    "figure : c2_3 ] , when the gas has dropped to @xmath145 of its original density , more objects have been lost to the inner edge , and those that remain from 0.5 to 1.5 au retain comparable mass ( i.e. the deviation from the mean is less than a factor of two ) and have grown to a mean mass just over @xmath142 . by 5 myr ( figure [ figure : c2_4 ] ) the @xmath146 region is now beyond 2.0 au and we are approaching the end of the transition phase and the beginning of our end stage ( where embryo - planetesimal accretion no longer plays a significant role . ) the mean embryo mass in the 0.5 - 1.5 au region is @xmath147 , brought down somewhat by the objects from 1.3 to 1.4 au . at this particular time the embryo spacing from 0.5 to 0.8 au is anomalously small , and this tightly - packed configuration quickly evolves to a wider one . at this time , after 5 e - foldings , the gas density has dropped to @xmath148 of its original value and gas drag ( whether aerodynamic or tidal ) is not important .",
    "the corresponding increase in eccentricity pushes the accretion timescale up substantially , and the dominant growth mechanism will now be embryo - embryo mergers .    between 10 myr and 20 myr ( figures [ figure : c2_5 ] and [ figure : c2_6 ] )",
    "we arrive at a long - lived configuration of embryos : only one embryo merger occurs between 0.5 au and 1.5 au , and it occurs before 14 myr .",
    "evolution is continuing beyond 1.75 au , and although limited , the remaining planetesimals are gradually being consumed .",
    "the mean embryo mass in the region of interest ( 0.5 - 1.5 au ) is @xmath149 , and the spacing varies from @xmath150 to @xmath151 , which is very well - separated .",
    "the eccentricities of the bodies ( @xmath152 ) , which have been increasing over time , are now many times above their tidally - suppressed values .",
    "the region contains @xmath153 in the form of embryos and a residual planetesimal field of @xmath154 for a total of @xmath155 in the zone from 0.5 - 1.5 au .",
    "as previously noted , roughly @xmath156 of material escapes the simulation to the inside .",
    "a substantial amount of mass remains beyond the zone of interest , however : @xmath157 of material is located beyond 1.5 au .",
    "this is problematic , as there is nothing approaching a @xmath158 object between the earth and mars ; we return to this problem in  [ transport ] .",
    "viewing the embryo evolution in @xmath159 space is instructive , as shown in fig.[figure : mat1 ] .",
    "three different regimes are apparent : for @xmath160 1.0 au the embryos head directly for the sun without scattering ; for 1.0 au @xmath161 1.5 au the embryos ` slide ' ( i.e.  collectively move in an orderly fashion , without orbit crossing ) toward their final destinations , slowing as the gas decay lowers the migration rate ; and for @xmath162 au the evolution is highly chaotic . figure [ figure : mat2 ] magnifies the innermost regions .    at early times ,",
    "when the embryo masses are low , the embryos can reorder themselves substantially and move several tenths of an au without suffering a merger with another embryo .",
    "however , as time passes and the masses of the embryos grow ( whether through accretion of planetesimals or direct embryo mergers ) , the migration pulls objects inwards at different rates .",
    "this leads to embryo segregration , and in some cases ( typically where migration rates are high ) to the formation of groups of two to four members which we call tidal convoys .",
    "( although not mentioned explicitly , this effect also appears to have been present in the simulations of @xcite ; see figure 6 in their paper . )    at any time in these convoys the objects are typically ordered such that the mass increases outwards .",
    "this is self - selection : if an inner object is more massive than an outer one , differential migration will cause the objects to diverge , breaking the convoy . as one would expect , the migration rate of the convoys is above that of the less massive objects and below that of the most massive object as the outer objects ` push ' on the inner ones . in many of our simulations , as in c2 , these groupings are only apparent on the inner edges ( where the object masses and gas density are highest ) as the decay of the gas disc and corresponding weakening of the migration makes the convoys harder to form and maintain . if we set @xmath163 , tidal convoying becomes nearly inevitable , which raises serious questions about the applicability of analytic oligarchy models to the middle - to - late stage transition unless the gas is presumed to have vanished .    in our simulations",
    ", while the gas remains , type i migration is remarkably efficient at capturing embryos into first - order mean motion resonances with each other , and the convoys usually show resonant relationships ( two - object pairs are especially susceptible . )",
    "this enhancement of resonance capture probability due to migration has been discussed in a different context by previous authors ( see @xcite for a possible explanation for the laplace resonance among the galilean satellites . ) most two - member tidal convoys are observed to be stable , but arguments to that end ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not easily generalized to the multiple - planet case , and in practice convoys involving three or more objects of different masses are eventually observed to merge .    beyond the convoying region , fig.[figure : mat2 ] shows part of the ` sliding ' region ( and , conveniently , a pair showing intermediate behaviour . ) as is apparent in fig.[figure : mat1 ] , when the masses and gas densities are such that the spacings will stay roughly constant during the migration , a group of embryos can move smoothly from further out in the disc suffering only a few mutual mergers .",
    "( admittedly , in c2 the surface density of the gas disc varied as @xmath164 , and one can show ( see section [ section : weiden ] ) that @xmath165 is constant for a fixed mass in this case . however , in the sliding region the masses vary by a factor of several , the gas density was decaying , and similar behaviours are seen for the @xmath166 case .",
    "the effect is not a peculiarity of this particular density law , although it is a consequence of the near - constant migration rates that it and similar laws provide . )    finally , in the lowest - mass region , chaotic behaviour persists for the entire length of the simulation , although it does begin to settle down by the end . in one case , the embryo excursion reached 1.3 au . even in this chaotic regime ,",
    "the broad outlines of the oligarchic model ( roughly equally spaced embryos of comparable mass ) were still respected , despite the fact that the simplest oligarchic picture is inapplicable as the embryos are being constantly reordered .",
    "this may imply that other mechanisms underly the oligarchic model s impressive robustness @xcite .",
    "these three regimes ( convoying , sliding , and chaotic ) were observed throughout the simulations  although their locations and strengths varied with mass , gas density , and stochastically - set spacing , as expected  and are likely frequent .",
    "time slices of the final configurations for simulations c1-c14 are plotted in figures [ figure : cset1 ] , [ figure : cset2 ] , and [ figure : cset3 ] .    the resulting mass in the 0.5 - 1.5 au region in the form of embryos ranges from @xmath167 to @xmath168 , and for planetesimals from 0.14@xmath169 to 0.44@xmath169 .",
    "some of the runs ( c2 , c3 , c4 , c6 ) yield very oligarchic - looking outcomes where the variation in mass between embryos is low , and the characteristic mass varies from 0.2 to 0.4 @xmath169 .",
    "others ( c1 , c7 , c8 , c9 , c10 ) produce systems with embryos of mass approaching @xmath170 , at least some of which are candidate planets .",
    "the remaining simulations are difficult to classify , although most show regions oligarchic in appearance with a few outliers ( e.g.  c12 , c14 . )",
    "c5 produced the least mass ( embryo mass @xmath171 , field mass @xmath172 ) for reasons to be discussed in ",
    "[ walls ] , and c1 the most ( @xmath173 ) . by accident ,",
    "c1 produced two dominant objects of terrestrial mass  venus and earth analogues .",
    "figures [ figure : mvsm1 ] and [ figure : mvsm2 ] show the resulting amounts of embryo and field mass for all simulations at 1 , 10 , and 20 myr .",
    "most simulations show an increase in embryo mass with time , and a substantial number of simulations landed in our nominal target region of 1.5 to @xmath174 in embryo mass and @xmath175 in planetesimal mass .",
    "the original expectation was for all the simulations to produce oligarchic - looking results ( as in c3 ) , not direct planet production ( as in c1 ) , but it is not surprising that with more massive embryos at least some embryo - embryo mergers would occur as the gas vanished , and it takes only a few such mergers at late times to produce a substantial planet . of the fourteen simulations , four produced less than two earth masses ( our nominal target ) of material in the region and the remaining ten produced more , leading one to suspect that our enhancements may have been too high .",
    "however , this depends entirely on how much of the material is removed during whatever processes turn the resulting configurations into terrestrial systems : they are quite widely spaced .      as noted by @xcite , the argument offered in @xcite to derive an estimate for the inter - embryo spacing @xmath13 as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath176 is of dubious applicability .",
    "recall that the spacing @xmath13 in their model is derived by equating the decrease in @xmath13 due to embryo growth ( due to planetesimal accretion ) with an increase in @xmath13 due to scattering .",
    "the two - body scattering formula of @xcite has a problem in the oligarchic context : namely , there are embryos on both sides of our scattering pair who are instead trying to scatter the two objects closer together",
    ". naively one would expect this to turn the @xmath13 growth from a monotonic process into a much slower random walk .",
    "the formula also assumes that the eccentricities of the two objects are near zero at conjunction , an assumption which breaks down in our model as the damping timescale increases with the dissipation of the gas .",
    "( simple experiments confirm both suspicions : the multiple - embryo case shows substantially slower @xmath13 growth than the two - embryo case , and introducing a decay in the strength of the eccentricity damping in the two - embryo case also washes out the growth . ) finally , when type i migration is active , differential migration of equal - mass objects will tend to increase b , and this is a non - negligible effect in our regime .    nevertheless , our numerical experiments suggest that @xmath177 is a reasonable approximation during the period we apply the semi - analytic model , possibly accidentally : embryos quickly scatter when @xmath178 and growth is a weak function of @xmath7 ( @xmath179 in @xcite ) so substantial masses are required before @xmath180 becomes unacceptable . in any case , corrections to the ` wrong ' chosen b occur on short timescales , and during testing no significant correlations between initial @xmath13 ( granted @xmath181 ) and the results were observed , suggesting that the equilibration process leaves little signature .",
    "figure [ figure : bevol ] shows the evolution of the mean mass - weighted @xmath13 in the region @xmath182 for all simulations .",
    "although the specific evolution varies from integration to integration , the trend of increase in @xmath13 from @xmath183 to @xmath184 is clear .",
    "the trend to large @xmath13 is accentuated by the tidal migration : in our control runs without tidal migration ( not shown ) we find values of @xmath185 were common in the late stages .",
    "the spikes near 4 and 6 myr are the result of unusual structures being formed ; the 4 myr spike in run c5 which reaches off the scale is to be further discussed in  [ walls ] .",
    "one concern is that we find spacings of more than 20 hill radii are typically sufficient to produce stable systems ( at least on timescales of 100 myr , the expected formation timescale ) .",
    "preliminary simulations suggest that the introduction of jupiter and saturn stirs the system enough to produce embryo interaction , and resonance sweeping involving the removal of the disc potential ( here neglected : see @xcite ) is another possibility .",
    "we will return to this issue in a subsequent paper .",
    "the gas drag ( both aerodynamic and tidal ) tends to drive embryo and field material inwards .",
    "scattering amongst embryos , or between embryos and field objects , can counteract this and move material outwards .",
    "the question of how the transport processes affect the resulting proportions of mass in the final embryos therefore arises ( i.e.  what amount of mass , from where . )",
    "figures [ figure : pie1 ] and [ figure : pie2 ] show the resulting material fraction by source region ( whether embryo or planetesimal . )",
    "substantial amounts of the material which ends up in the 0.5 - 1.5 au region comes from beyond 1.5 au , and even from beyond 2 au . in some rare cases ( e.g.  the embryo at 1.2 au in c1 , or at 0.87 au in c8 ) ,",
    "an embryo in fact consists mostly of material from beyond 2 au .",
    "it is not surprising there are general trends with @xmath48 . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ figure : pie1 ] , we see in runs c4 , c5 , and c6 ( each with @xmath48 = 2 myr ) , more material from beyond 2 au is incorporated than in c1-c3 ( with decay timescale 1 myr . )",
    "a somewhat weaker trend with migration efficiency @xmath62 is also evident .",
    "comparatively little material originally from 1 au becomes part of embryos beyond 1.2 au .",
    "we do not believe that our lack of embryos and planetesimals beyond 2.5 au at @xmath120 myr plays a significant role in these results : in the majority of the resulting embryos , material from beyond 2.25 au contributes little , and the arguable exception of c6 is the simulation with the most migration ( the result of a 2 myr dissipation timescale and an efficiency @xmath63 ) .",
    "the large degree of inward mixing suggests that present - epoch local chemistry may be probing much further out in the planetary disc than might have been expected without migration , at least if countervailing effects such as disc turbulence are limited .",
    "consequences of different models of material transport during terrestrial planet formation on presently observed water abundances are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "[ section : weiden ] recently weidenschilling , in unpublished work , has also been investigating terrestrial formation in enhanced discs with migration using a hybrid dynamical and statistical technique and reached broadly consistent conclusions ( private communication , dps 2004 . )",
    "however , he reports a definite tendency for material to accumulate in the inner regions .",
    "as we remove objects when they get below 0.4 au , and do not simulate any objects inside of 0.75 au at our start of 0.3 myr , we are insensitive to the production of a terrestrial - mass mercury .",
    "this decision was motivated by our early experiments , which demonstrated that the oligarchic predictions of the  [ section : model ] model were reliable ( except for certain details of the @xmath13 spacing ) over a large mass range before type i migration played a role and were tolerable , although less accurate , at tidally significant masses .",
    "the resulting embryos were massive enough that they invariably migrated inside of 0.4 au before the gas vanished .",
    "although these early embryos escaped our region of interest , this is not a guarantee that they would succeed in migrating all the way to the sun . to investigate the likely future of embryos whose dynamics we stopped tracing",
    ", we can take the objects removed for falling off the inner edge of our simulation and integrate the tidal migration equations ( [ eq : v_m ] ) and ( [ eq : ta_semianal ] ) . for @xmath186 , then @xmath187 , and for @xmath166 , @xmath188 .",
    "figure [ figure : wdev ] shows the projected evolution of the escaped embryos , considered one at a time .",
    "the majority of objects ( 80% ) succeed in making it to the solar radius ( @xmath189 au ) , and so our removal of them from the simulation is defensible .",
    "in over half of the simulations , no embryo which was removed would have survived . in several runs ( c1 , c2 , c4 , c9 , c10 , c11 ) ,",
    "multiple embryos would have survived , although in only four of these ( c2 , c4 , c10 , c11 ) would an embryo have survived inside of 0.2 au .",
    "note this analysis is restricted to the embryos which were actually integrated and then removed , not to embryos which should have been there but never were ( e.g.  embryos initially located at 0.5 au ) .",
    "a fortiori most of the embryos we did not include inside of 0.75 au would have also made it to the surface of the sun , at least for the 1 myr and 2 myr decay timescales . in the 0.5 myr case , with its resulting lower migration , although we are not missing much material which should end up in the 0.5 - 1.5 au region",
    ", we could be missing a substantial amount between 0.2 and 0.4 au by our choice of initial embryo range .",
    "as for planetesimals , given the effectiveness of migrating jacobi wings as a sweeping mechanism , it seems likely that many of the planetesimals not incorporated into the interior embryos would move with the flow , and given the strong dependence on semimajor axis of formation timescale there are unlikely to be many left at 0.4 au when tidally - significant embryos are emerging at 1 au and beyond . in summary , for @xmath190 1 myr , we expect that we are missing only a few embryos , and do not believe our choice of inner edge significantly affects our conclusions .",
    "the outer regions present their own set of difficulties : an average of @xmath191 of material is left beyond 1.5 au ( recall that the initial outermost embryo in each simulation is located at @xmath192 au ) , which is an order of magnitude above the mass of mars ( @xmath193 ) . as is evident from the discussion of  [ subsection : final ] , we have provided an upper bound on the necessary disc enhancement to survive type i migration , as our enhancements consistently produce more mass than desired .",
    "decreasing the enhancement to reduce this overproduction will mitigate this problem somewhat , but even a one - third decrease will still leave @xmath194 of material .",
    "this problem is not unique to our migration models , however : the naive minimum mass model , @xmath195 , itself produces @xmath196 of material between 1.5 and 2.5 au .",
    "the majority of the unwanted material in this region in our simulations is simply a reflection of how much was there to begin with .",
    "one can deal with this problem in several ways : assume a primordial decrease in original surface density in the region between earth and mars ; increase the material transport rates in some fashion , e.g.  collisional grinding producing large amounts of dust which leaves the region very quickly due to aerodynamic drag ; and so on .",
    "any approach which solves the problem for non - enhanced models without migration will have a natural analogue in our enhanced models with migration , and therefore the problem is no worse in our model than for the standard scenario .    of course",
    ", it is unlikely that a simple power - law profile accurately describes the density of the protoplanetary disc ( either solids or gas ) to within a few radii of the sun .",
    "if the solid density reaches a local maximum near 1 au , it may be possible to avoid any interior and exterior problems entirely .",
    "an unexpected side effect of neglecting the self - interactions of the field particles became apparent during some of the simulations .",
    "occasionally , due to an early embryo - embryo merger , an object is produced which is prematurely massive relative to its neighbours .",
    "the increase in mass results in a higher migration rate than the next outer embryo , and a gap opens up between them where the only objects are planetesimals .",
    "this region devoid of embryos can also be created by a major scattering event . in a weak sense",
    "this process occurs during every merger , but most of the time the gap is quickly filled by another embryo , whether through migration or scattering .",
    "however , under certain circumstances , this gap is not closed quickly with the entrance of an embryo from further out in the disc , but instead persists . in the absence of embryos",
    "there is nothing to stir the field , and the aerodynamic drag decreases the field eccentricity , resulting in a thin ring of planetesimals ( except where an exterior embryo arrives to form a new jacobi wing . ) in extreme cases the width of the ring is substantial ( e.g.  0.2 au ) , corresponding to a large amount of mass ( @xmath197 ) . at this point",
    "it can serve as a wall , and act as a barrier to the entry of inward - migrating embryos from beyond the ring .",
    "there are several possibilities for the resulting behaviour .",
    "sometimes the ring is quickly disrupted , especially if it is small . at other times",
    "the ring endures until an exterior embryo pushes through .",
    "this often leads to a surprisingly quick transition of the embryo through the ring , a consequence of the process of forming jacobi wings .",
    "the ring may or may not survive this embryo crossing . sometimes the ring endures , and the evolution stalls as the embryo masses reached exterior to the ring are insufficient to push through the barrier .",
    "an example of an extreme scenario ( from run c5 ) is demonstrated in figure [ figure : wall ] , the most massive ( by a factor of several ) and longest - lived ( also by a factor of several ) ring in our simulations . at 2 myr ,",
    "the system is unremarkable : between 1.0 and 1.7 au there are four embryos separated by @xmath198 au , with planetesimals throughout . by 2.5 myr , however",
    ", scattering events have resulted in a region from 1.3 au to 1.6 au without any embryos , but with almost an earth mass of planetesimal material .",
    "after another half million years , the innermost embryos have migrated out of the region , and only one embryo of @xmath199 remains to control the dynamics .",
    "( this wide embryo - free region is responsible for the highest spike in @xmath13 in fig.[figure : bevol ] . ) over the next 8 myr , the ring moves from @xmath200 au to @xmath201 au as a result of both aerodynamic drag ( over the first several million years , at any rate ; the dissipation timescale in c5 is 2 myr ) and the more significant push given by the exterior embryo . during this push ,",
    "the embryo consumes enough of the ring during the jacobi scattering to grow from @xmath202 to @xmath203 . finally , an encounter between the shepherd embryo and and its neighbour scatters the shepherd into the ring by 11.5 myr .",
    "when the embryo enters , it quickly migrates through and disrupts the ring . by 12 myr",
    "the ring is gone .",
    "we emphasize that this is an extreme case , and that when the rings do not form or are quickly disrupted by the embryos ( before field interactions would be expected to do so ) the two - component embryo / field approximation we make remains acceptable .    could these rings be physical , or are they merely artifacts of our simplified treatment of the planetesimal field ?",
    "it is true that some early mergers and scattering events are going to occur , and differential migration will then attempt to produce a gap .",
    "however , in a system with a more realistic mass spectrum ( with objects of intermediate mass ) the second - tier objects which are not accreted during the migration of the overmassive embryo might ascend to be the new oligarchs in the absence of competition .",
    "furthermore , eventually mutual planetesimal - planetesimal encounters ( which we neglect ) should produce new seed objects for oligarchic growth within the ring .",
    "rings which last for less than the timescale for internal disruption seem possible , and may occur in real planetary systems . in this case",
    ", their chief effect would seem to be slowing the migration process for embryos with exterior semimajor axes .",
    "various authors , looking with dismay at the unhappy consequences of type i migration for forming giant cores , have concluded that the effect simply does not occur .",
    "some recent work @xcite has also argued that the timescale for migration in some circumstances may be substantially larger than we have assumed here .",
    "this may ultimately prove correct , but several points are worth making in response .",
    "first , given the complexity of the local gas physics near the embryo , it is probably premature to rule out near - nominal migration ; a clear understanding of the behaviour will need to wait for the next generation of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "for example , it is entirely possible that whatever effects hypothetically shut off type i migration before the opening of a gap only become significant for embryo masses near or beyond earth mass .",
    "if so , the intuition that type i is migration is too destructive to have occurred in our system could be completely justified regarding the giant planets but not relevant for terrestrial formation .",
    "disc properties such as opacity on which migration may sensitively depend are extremely poorly constrained , and saying anything firm will require improved proplyd observations .",
    "that said , it seems possible that the gas disc is far less smooth than we have assumed , and type i migration may be halted by abrupt changes in gradient , opacity , or density at unknown locations . for example",
    ", @xcite develops models for the photoevaporation of the disc which result in a zone of depleted gas which could protect the terrestrial region from marauding proto - jovian embryos .",
    "although these specific models have dynamical consequences which make them difficult to accept at face value , the possibility of significant disc inhomogeneities causing similar effects remains .",
    "unfortunately all of this will clearly be very difficult to model .",
    "disc turbulence can wash out the effect of tidal migration on short timescales @xcite but may not remove a net drift ; we hope to study oligarchy in a turbulent disc in future work .",
    "[ caveats ]    several compromises made to complete the integrations with the available resources may affect the results .",
    "the neglect of field self - interaction contributes to the formation of rings , although to the degree that the behaviour of the system truly is oligarchic , the embryo - field model should be a reasonable approximation .",
    "nevertheless , our representation of the mass spectrum is limited , and no field object can promote itself to an embryo .",
    "we have chosen 100 km as the underlying planetesimal size , which is both plausible ( the formation timescale for such objects is comparable to the absolute time when we begin the simulation ) and conventional in terrestrial formation simulations .",
    "smaller planetesimal particles , such as those produced in a fragmentation spectrum , would lead to different accretion rates @xcite in potentially complicated ways , and would also be likely to result in higher migration rates for planetesimals due to aerodynamic drag , possibly requiring greater disc enhancement .",
    "the artificial increase of the seed mass for the embryos may also cause problems .",
    "it changes the gradient in embryo mass , and means that at a given time , the outermost embryos are more massive relative to their inner neighbours than they should be . when the evolution is local , this is defensible , but during migration it will lead to an overestimation of the transport .",
    "the overestimation should be mild in practice as the outermost objects are sub - migratory at @xmath128 = 0.3 myr , when our n - body simulations begin .",
    "we have investigated the likely conditions at the beginning of the terrestrial endgame as a result of type i migration during the mid - to - late transition . for reasonable values of the parameters we find that plausible progenitors for the terrestrial planets can survive despite type i migration at near the nominal rate , provided the disc density is enhanced above the minimum model . in particular , in order to get the right amount of material left in the terrestrial region with a gas dissipation timescale of @xmath0 myr , one must work with discs several times more massive than the minimum model , although a lower enhancement than we used here would likely suffice .",
    "( preliminary investigations to be reported elsewhere using discs of @xmath204 times the minimum mass model are encouraging , and show good agreement with expectations . ) as a consequence , the resulting systems at the beginning of the late phase show significant differences from the conditions normally considered ( e.g.  @xcite ) : ( 1 ) there is often a large amount , @xmath205 of material remaining in the form of planetesimals ( supporting the direction taken in @xcite ) at the time of dissipation ; ( 2 ) the embryos tend to have larger masses , with mode @xmath206 ; and ( 3 ) the embryos are separated by @xmath207 single - planet hill radii .    in a forthcoming paper we take the next step and study what must be done to turn our new endgame conditions into terrestrial planets . as",

    "<S> we conclude that even for near - nominal migration efficiencies and gas dissipation timescales of @xmath0 myr it is possible to maintain sufficient mass in the terrestrial region to form earth and venus if the disc mass is enhanced by factors of @xmath1 over the minimum mass model . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting configurations differ in several ways from the initial conditions used in previous simulations of the final stages of terrestrial accretion ( e.g.  @xcite ) , chiefly in ( 1 ) larger inter - embryo spacings , ( 2 ) larger embryo masses , and ( 3 ) up to @xmath2 of material left in the form of planetesimals when the gas vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the systems we produce are reasonably stable for @xmath3 myr and therefore require an external source to stir up the embryos sufficiently to produce final systems resembling the terrestrial planets . </S>"
