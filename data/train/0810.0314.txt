    "galactic rotation curves are one of the most important evidences favoring the dark matter scenario in astrophysics .",
    "actually dark matter was proposed by zwicky @xcite in order to accommodate observed velocities in galaxies and galaxy clusters . since then",
    "others explanations was proposed as modifications of newtonian gravity @xcite or modifications in general relativity @xcite .",
    "all these approaches have in common , from the modeling point of view , just one element : non - linearity .",
    "so , is natural asks the question if non - linear effects of some sort are responsible for the discrepancy observed in galaxies and galaxy cluster dynamics .",
    "recently , in the context of general relativity , some authors have investigated this point @xcite .    here",
    ", we will propose an alternative paradigm where newtonian gravity is maintained on its solid basements but a non - linear model of a galaxy is build .",
    "we solve the non - linear equations in two simplified cases and calculate the resulting galaxy rotation curves , showing qualitatively that flat curves can be obtained in a given region of the parameter space .",
    "we focus on spiral galaxies described as a fluid with mass distribution in the phase space , @xmath0 which is related to the ordinary mass distribution by@xmath1 where @xmath2 the mass for a typical star .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the poisson equation coming from the second newton law,@xmath3 but restricted to the mass conservation,@xmath4    using a hamiltonian description , @xmath5 * * , * * @xmath6 , we obtain,@xmath7    in general , this is a set of integro - differential non - linear coupled equations .",
    "let us restrict the model only to the disc of the galaxy in the static regime .",
    "so , using the axial symmetry of this system , the mass conservation equation become:@xmath8    this equation can be solved using the method of characteristics . assuming a constant angular velocity , this is equivalent to a set of ordinary differential equations,@xmath9 whose uniparametric family of solutions is@xmath10    experimental data shows that the mass distribution is gaussian in the observed velocities , therefore is natural to choose the mass distribution @xmath11 to be a boltzmann distribution in the total energy:@xmath12   \\right)\\ ] ]    the integration over the velocities can be done , in order to obtain the functional dependence of the mass distribution over the gravitational potential@xmath13    it means that the poisson equation now is a non - linear partial differential equation , given by@xmath14",
    "let us to take an over simplified case , assuming that the field vary only with the height to the plane of the disc,@xmath15 using an integration factor @xmath16 and the boundary conditions @xmath17 this equation can be directly integrated,@xmath18    the density profile in this case is@xmath19    so far , it is a reasonable model , since the disc predicted is thin .",
    "let us to take another over simplified model assuming variation only in the radial direction,@xmath20    multiplying both sides by @xmath21 and integrating , we find@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radius of the galaxy core , and @xmath24 .",
    "performing a second integration , we arrive in a volterra second order integral equation:@xmath25    to solve it , we apply the piccard s method of successive approximations:@xmath26@xmath27 therefore , the first order iterative solution is@xmath28",
    "assuming a virial balance , @xmath29 , the galaxy rotation curve in this model is @xmath30@xmath31    in our illustrative example , @xmath32 , we have the behavior illustrated in fig .",

    "and @xmath33 is the distance to center in adimensional units .",
    "@xmath34 is the parameter dictated by the boundary condition at the core .",
