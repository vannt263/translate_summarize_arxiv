    "the physics of particle acceleration at relativistic collisionless shock waves plays a key role in the description of a number of powerful astrophysical objects , e.g. blazars , pulsar wind nebulae , gamma - ray bursts etc .",
    "one of the lessons learned in the past decade in this field of research , is the importance of the non - linear relationship that ties the acceleration process and the generation of micro - turbulence in the shock vicinity .",
    "it was anticipated early on that the self - generation of micro - turbulence on length scales much smaller than the gyroradius of the accelerated particles is a necessary condition for the proper development of the relativistic fermi process ( lemoine et al .",

    "( 2013a ) .    the particle - in - cell ( pic ) numerical simulations of spitkovsky ( 2008a , b ) have confirmed the validity of these arguments and offered a more exhaustive picture of the acceleration process in the ultra - relativistic unmagnetized limit .",
    "these simulations have shown that the accelerated ( supra - thermal ) particle population excites filamentation instabilities upstream of unmagnetized shock waves ( meaning , shock waves propagating in an unmagnetized medium ) , see also nishikawa et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; these instabilities build up a magnetic barrier on plasma scales @xmath1 and at the same time serve as scattering centers for the acceleration process .",
    "as the magnetic field energy density grows to an equipartition fraction @xmath2 ( @xmath3 denotes the fraction of incoming kinetic energy flux in the shock front rest frame stored in magnetic energy ) , incoming particles can be isotropized on a coherence length scale of the order of @xmath4 , thereby initiating the shock transition .",
    "the gyroradius of accelerated particles remains larger than this length scale and the fermi acceleration process develops as anticipated .",
    "these simulations have been confirmed , and followed by further pic simulations with different conditions , in particular regarding the degree of magnetization of the upstream ( background ) plasma , the obliquity of the magnetic field and the nature ( pairs vs electron - proton ) of the incoming flow ( e.g. keshet et al .",

    "( 1992 ) and gallant et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    however , at intermediate magnetizations and/or very large lorentz factors , the physics remains poorly known .",
    "indeed , the filamentation instability and other two stream modes can not be excited in these regions of parameter space , because the timescale on which the incoming particles cross the precursor becomes shorter than the timescale on which such instabilities can be excited ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , how the shock is structured in such conditions remains an open question .",
    "we report here on a new current - driven instability which is likely to emerge as the dominant instability in this range of magnetization and at very large lorentz factors .",
    "the electric current is carried by the suprathermal particles ( or shock reflected particles ) and results from their gyration in the background magnetic field : assuming that the magnetic field is oriented along the @xmath5 axis , while the incoming plasma flows along @xmath6 in the shock rest frame , the current is generated along @xmath7 , since the lorentz force deflects positive and negative suprathermal particles in opposite directions .",
    "as the ambient plasma penetrates the precursor , it develops a compensating current along @xmath8 .",
    "this configuration is found to be unstable , because a current fluctuation can couple to a density fluctuation and excite a combination of extraordinary modes and compressive modes of the ambient plasma .",
    "this will be made explicit further on .",

    "while in the weibel instability , the counterstreaming beams contain particles of similar charge , which thus deviate in a perturbed magnetic field in different directions to form filaments of opposite current , in the current - driven filamentation instability , the beams contain particles of opposite charge , which thus deviate in the same direction and create filaments with a current oriented in the same direction , i.e. so as to compensate the current of the suprathermal particles .",

    "this choice is dictated by simplicity , as including the response involves doubling the number of fluid variables , which renders the problem untractable .",

    "let us now discuss why the current - driven filamentation instability is likely to play a central role in shaping the precursor , the shock and the acceleration process in the relativistic mildly magnetized regime .",
    "advection through the shock front provides a crucial limitation for the growth of instabilities upstream of a relativistic shock front . in the upstream plasma rest frame , this can be understood as follows : the precursor extends at most to a distance @xmath189 ( e.g. milosavljevi & nakar 2006 , pelletier et al . 2009 ) , because the suprathermal particles only rotate by an amount @xmath190 before being caught back by the shock front ; this takes a time @xmath191 , but the distance between the shock front and the tip of this precursor does not exceed @xmath192 .",
    "therefore , as measured in the upstream plasma rest frame ( indicated by @xmath193 ) , any instability whose growth rate @xmath194 can not grow on the crossing time of the precursor .",
    "for the filamentation instability , @xmath195 , therefore the instability can grow only if @xmath196 ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "this indicates that mildly magnetized and/or large lorentz factor shock waves can not be mediated by the weibel - filamentation instability , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the present current - driven filamentation instability modifies this picture , because it grows faster than any of the other instabilities discussed in the context of relativistic shocks , and mostly because of the impact of the current on the incoming plasma in the shock front frame : as discussed in app .",
    "[ sec : app ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] , if @xmath197 , the upstream can not compensate the current at rest ; it is therefore accelerated along @xmath26 to a lorentz factor @xmath198 in the upstream rest frame , and its apparent density increases by a similar amount . in the shock front frame ,",
    "the incoming plasma is slowed down to velocities @xmath199 , which means that the rest frame of the plasma effectively moves with a lorentz factor ( along @xmath6 ) : @xmath200 .",
    "this change of rest frame , relative to far infinity , strongly modifies the criterion under which the instability has or does not have time to grow . in the @xmath17 frame , which defines the rest frame of the background plasma after its acceleration phase , the shock front moves with a lorentz factor @xmath201 , therefore the precursor size extends to @xmath202 and the timescale for a plasma mode to cross this precursor now reads @xmath203 so that the instability can grow whenever @xmath204 , or @xmath205 for typical values @xmath206 , this implies that growth is possible up to magnetization levels @xmath207 , _ irrespective of the lorentz factor of the shock_. the latter point is of importance , because it guarantees the growth of instabilities at large @xmath33 , for which the precursor becomes very short in the upstream rest frame .",

    "this instability may then step over closer to the shock front , where the back - reaction of the turbulence strongly randomizes the return trajectories of the supra - thermal particles .",
    "nevertheless , one expect the precursor to be shaped by the size @xmath36 if the current - driven instability shapes the precursor , or even the tip of the precursor : beyond that length scale , the turbulence must die away quickly , because the plasma has not yet slowed down and instabilities can not grow there ; inside the precursor , one may expect some form of equilibrium to be reached between the level of the turbulence , the slow - down of the plasma and the growth rate of the instabilities .",
    "its detailed study lies beyond the present work .",

    "( [ eq : nuo ] ) and the discussion in lemoine & pelletier ( 2010 )",
    ". there , current - driven filamentation can grow , irrespectively of the shock lorentz factor ; it builds up turbulence and , because @xmath249 , scattering in the micro - turbulence downstream of the shock front beats advection , hence the fermi process develops . at larger values of @xmath97 ,",
    "the same simulations indicate that fermi acceleration develops in a restricted dynamic range , with a maximum energy scaling as @xmath250 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : nuo ] ) , taken at face value , would indicate that fermi acceleration should not develop in this limit .",
    "however , this argument assumes a homogeneous micro - turbulence downstream of the shock , of strength @xmath251 , whereas the micro - turbulence seen in pic simulations actually decreases away from the shock front .",
    "if the law of evolution of @xmath3 were known , one could improve on eq .",
    "( [ eq : nuo ] ) by comparing the scattering time in this evolving micro - turbulence and the gyration time in the background field . in the absence of such a well - defined law",
    ", one can nevertheless understand on a qualitative level the scaling of the maximal energy : as the magnetization increases beyond @xmath252 , the condition @xmath253 remains true only in a finite layer close to the shock front ; since the scattering length - scale evolves as the square of the particle energy , the restricted size of this layer leads to the existence of a maximal energy .",
    "let us note , that if this layer were of infinite extent , there would nevertheless be a maximal energy , scaling as @xmath254 , as dicussed in pelletier et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the above discussion directly impacts our understanding of shock structuration and of particle acceleration .",
    "for instance , sironi et al . (",
    "2013 ) argue that in front of the shock , there exists a layer of size @xmath244 filled with weibel turbulence at a level @xmath255 ; this observation is based on the simulations reported above , in the range @xmath256 . according to the above discussion",
    ", this layer actually reflects the constrained growth of current - driven filamentation and weibel- filamentation instabilities in the precursor , whose size is set by the current profile , which extends on @xmath36 , and the turbulence is not of weibel origin .    these authors then extrapolate their results to the regime of low magnetization @xmath257 to discuss the maximal energy of particles accelerated at relativistic shocks .",
    "the above arguments indicate that such an extrapolation is not justified , because the physics of the precursor are likely to change as one transits from the region controlled by the current - driven filamentation instability to that controlled solely by the weibel - filamentation mode . in particular , as @xmath258 , the diverging scale @xmath36 must decouple and one expects the precursor profile to be entirely controlled by the micro - turbulence , as in the unmagnetized limit .",
    "the above discussion indicates that this transition takes place close to the line @xmath259 and @xmath260 to @xmath261 ; for @xmath240 as used in these simulations , both limits reduce to the latter @xmath260 to @xmath261 .",
    "this work reports on a new current - driven filamentation instability usptream of a magnetized relativistic collisionless shock front .",
    "as viewed in the shock front frame , the suprathermal particles , which are reflected on the shock front , or accelerated at the shock , gyrate around the perpendicular magnetic field in the shock precursor , thereby depositing a strong current @xmath262 , which is both perpendicular to the magnetic field and to the shock normal . as the incoming plasma enters the precursor",
    ", it seeks to compensate this current within a few skin depth scales .",
    "if @xmath263 , which is a likely situation for highly relativistic shocks , the incoming plasma can not compensate this current in the upstream rest frame ; it is thus accelerated to a large lorentz factor @xmath264 ( relative to far upstream ) , which increases the apparent density of the plasma by a similar factor ; particles then drift at relativistic velocities in the perpendicular direction to achieve current compensation , electrons and positrons drifting in opposite directions . in the shock front rest frame ,",
    "the incoming plasma is decelerated along the shock normal at the same time as it is accelerated in this perpendicular direction .",
    "as we have argued , this current destabilizes a combination of the high frequency branch of the extraordinary mode and of the acoustic mode along the magnetic field . in a 2d configuration ,",
    "in which one neglects perturbations along the direction of the current , this instability bears some resemblance to the weibel - filamentation instability .",
    "however , in the present case , the electromagnetic perturbation couples to a density fluctuation , not to a charge fluctuation , because the counterstreaming electrons and positrons carry opposite charges .",
    "this leads to the formation of current filaments of a same polarity , all currents being oriented so as to compensate the cosmic ray current induced in the precursor .",
    "we find that this instability has a very fast growth rate , of order @xmath265 on skin depth scales , with @xmath100 the drift velocity .",
    "this instability is likely to play a key role in shaping the precursor of weakly magnetized relativistic collisionless shocks , in which the growth of other instabilities is very often impeded by the fast transit across the precursor .",
    "in particular , we have shown that this instability can grow at any value of the lorentz factor , provided the magnetization parameter @xmath266 .",
    "the relative independence to the lorentz factor of the shock , which controls the size of the precursor @xmath267 ( upstream rest frame ) , stems from the deceleration that the incoming plasma suffers inside the precursor : the relative lorentz factor between the shock front frame and the rest frame of the plasma now falls to @xmath200 , independent of @xmath33 . in this picture",
    ", the shock foot plays the role of a buffer that transforms the interaction with the fast incoming flow into a more moderate regime , depending on the parameter @xmath268 , over a well defined distance @xmath269 ( in the instantaneous rest frame of the incoming plasma ) .",
    "in previous studies , we have argued that the filamentation , oblique two stream modes etc .",
    ", can grow only at small values of @xmath97 and moderate values of @xmath33 , e.g. such that @xmath270 for the weibel - filamentation mode ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 , 2011 ) . otherwise , the incoming plasma transits faster across the precursor than a growth time of the instability .",
    "therefore , the current - driven filamentation instability emerges as the leading instability outside this region of parameter space . at very low magnetizations , @xmath233 , and in the region where the standard filamentation mode can grow ,",
    "the current - driven filamentation instability should gradually disappear , as the turbulent small scale electromagnetic fields randomize the return trajectories of the suprathermal particles in the shock front plane . in this limit , one transits to the unmagnetized limit ,",
    "in which the precursor size is no longer controlled by the background magnetic field , but by the profile of the micro - turbulence .    outside this region , up to @xmath271 ,",
    "the current driven filamentation instability is likely to play a dominant role .",
    "the interesting physics of the shock at low magnetizations and at lorentz factor so large that the standard weibel - filamentation mode can not grow , deserves close scrutiny . in this region ,",
    "the current filamentation instability can grow in the absence of strong microturbulence ; however the very growth of this instability and of the filamentation mode , thanks to the deceleration of the plasma , builds up the small scale turbulence , which then back reacts on the current profile .",
    "the profile of the precursor in this regime is left open for further study .",
    "our analysis at linear level indicates that the growth rate of the current - driven filamentation instability is maximal on plasma skin depth scales .",
