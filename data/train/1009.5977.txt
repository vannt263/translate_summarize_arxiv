    "the simplest situation at finite density may be the case with equal chemical potentials @xmath7 for all flavors , where the s - quark density may be suppressed compared with the u- and d - quarks due to the mass difference .",
    "however , the quark chemical potentials @xmath5 are generally unequal in various physical situations .",
    "there are more protons than neutrons in nuclei and also in neutron stars because of the electric charge of protons . in the core of compact stars in beta equilibrium",

    "the phase structure at finite chemical potentials has very rich theoretical possibilities@xcite .",
    "historically , in dense nuclear matter , nucleon superfluidity , pion and kaon condensations , and hyperon mixture were studied based on empirical nucleon interactions and chiral perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "more recently , color superconductivity was extensively investigated and the kaon condensed phase acquired renewed interests there@xcite .",
    "possibility of inhomogeneous phases is also discussed recently  @xcite .    another motivation to consider the phase diagram with unequal chemical potentials is that one can directly examine in lattice qcd simulations the @xmath8 case with finite isospin and zero quark chemical potentials , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where the measure for the importance sampling is real .",
    "we note that it may be possible to simulate the @xmath11 case with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , at least in principle .    the ground state at finite isospin chemical potential but at zero quark number density was studied with the chiral lagrangian , which revealed that the pion condensate appears once @xmath2 exceeds half the pion mass @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the chiral random matrix ( chrm ) model is one of the models which share the chiral symmetry with qcd .",
    "thus it will serve as a useful model providing qualitative features of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the phase structure of the ( chrm ) model , including the possibilities of the meson condensations , as a function of the quark chemical potentials @xmath5 ( @xmath22=u , d , s ) at zero temperature .    in the previous work of the chrm model with two flavors done in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the pion condensed phase appears at finite @xmath2 above a critical value @xmath23 as suggested by @xcite , whereas it eventually disappears as @xmath2 is further increased , which is understood as the chiral restoration at high density .",
    "it was also indicated that with small nonzero @xmath2 the chiral restoration occurs in two steps : as @xmath3 is increased with ( e.g. ) negative @xmath24 fixed , the @xmath25 condensate discontinuously decreases first , and then the @xmath26 at slightly larger @xmath3 .",
    "the two- ( or three- ) step transition along the @xmath3 axis with finite @xmath2 and/or @xmath1 is also observed in the three flavor case of the chrm model@xcite and in the two and three flavor cases of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "this two - step transition happens evidently because these models do not include flavor mixing interactions and then each quark sector independently responds to each quark chemical potential @xmath5 . the u(1)@xmath0  anomaly in qcd is known to induce the flavor mixing and tends to unify the two chiral transitions into one .",
    "this is demonstrated in the njl model with u(1)@xmath0  breaking effective interactions , which results in the usual phase diagram with a single transition@xcite .",
    "the u(1)@xmath0  anomaly effect is indispensable to build a low - energy effective model of hadrons in medium as well as in vacuum@xcite .",
    "although in a conventional chrm model the u(1)@xmath0  anomaly effect is not treated appropriately so as to affect the nature of the chiral transition , recently we have succeeded in constructing the model in which the u(1)@xmath0  breaking term generates the flavor - number dependence of the transition order@xcite .",

    "the quark number chemical potential @xmath5 is introduced independently for each quark flavor @xmath22 with a constant lorentz vector @xmath36 .    in the massless limit @xmath37 with zero chemical potential @xmath38",
    ", the classical qcd lagrangian possesses u@xmath39u@xmath40 chiral symmetry , which is broken down to u(1)@xmath41su@xmath39su@xmath40 at the quantum level due to the axial anomaly .",
    "the u(1)@xmath42 invariance results in the quark number conservation .",
    "non - perturbative qcd dynamics is believed to break this symmetry spontaneously to u(1)@xmath41su@xmath43 , generating a large part of the nucleon mass and the light pions as the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson . in reality ,",
    "nonzero quark mass term acts as an external field to select the ordinary vacuum state with nonzero @xmath44 condensate out of the nearly degenerate vacua .",
    "the chiral symmetry of qcd is intact at finite quark number chemical potential as far as it is flavor - singlet , which is usually assumed in the context of finite density qcd .",
    "once the flavor - nonsinglet potential is set nonzero , it gives a stress on the flavor symmetric ground state in addition to the quark mass term .",
    "symmetry breaking pattern in this situation has been studied most conveniently with the chiral lagrangian@xcite .",
    "let us consider the @xmath8 case with the small u- and d - quark masses @xmath45",
    ". at zero chemical potential there appear nearly degenerate vacua connected with each other by the su(2)@xmath46su(2)@xmath47o(4 ) transformation , and the true ground state aligns to the direction of the quark mass term with su(2)@xmath48 invariance .",
    "when the isospin chemical potential @xmath49 is applied , this invariance explicitly breaks down to u(1 ) @xmath50 su(2)@xmath48 around the 3rd isospin axis .",
    "the mass @xmath51 and the potential @xmath2 compete to fix the ground state . for @xmath52 , a new class of the degenerate vacua appears with nonzero pion field and the ground state spontaneously breaks the u(1 ) symmetry , which is accompanied by the appearance of an ng boson .",
    "this symmetry breaking pattern is summarized as follows : @xmath53    for @xmath11 , we consider the 2 + 1 flavor case where the quark masses @xmath54 and the chemical potentials @xmath55 in general . in this case , all flavor symmetry is broken explicitly leaving only u(1)@xmath46u(1)@xmath46u(1 ) invariance which represents the conservation of each flavor . once ( e.g. , ) @xmath56 meson condensate is formed in addition to the nonzero chiral condensates , the symmetry is spontaneously broken down to u(1)@xmath46u(1)@xmath57 , where u(1)@xmath57 leaves the condensate @xmath58 invariant .",
    "we also find one ng mode corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of u(1 ) . , etc.@xcite .",
    "] the symmetry breaking pattern is @xmath59",
    "the chiral random matrix model@xcite is constructed based on the idea that the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry is dominated by the low - lying dirac eigenmodes , as is manifest in the banks - casher relation between the chiral condensate and the spectral density near zero@xcite .",
    "the dirac operator @xmath60 is then truncated to be a matrix within the restricted space spanned by the ( quasi- ) zero modes , and the matrix elements are treated as random variables .",
    "explicitly , in the representation where @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a rectangular complex random matrix and @xmath64 is a non - random matrix responsible for the effects of temperature and chemical potentials . note that the block structure follows from the chiral symmetry @xmath65 .",
    "when the matrix @xmath63 is not square but rectangular , the dirac operator @xmath60 has @xmath66 exact zero eigenvalues with @xmath66 being the difference between the numbers of the rows and the columns of @xmath63 .",
    "this is the realization of the index theorem for the topological charge and the number of exact zero modes in chrm model .",
    "hence , in order to include the anomaly effects , we need to deal with the non - square matrix properly . to this end",
    ", we categorize the zero modes into two species , the near - zero modes and the topological zero modes@xcite .",
    "the former are assumed to be @xmath67 left- and @xmath67 right - handed low - lying modes generated in gluon dynamics , while the latter are interpreted as the modes each of which is localized near one of @xmath68 instantons or @xmath69 anti - instantons in a gauge field configuration .",
    "then the size of the matrix @xmath63 is taken as @xmath70 and the topological charge of the configuration is @xmath71 .",

    "the dirac operator @xmath60 with nonzero chemical potential @xmath77 is no longer anti - hermitian , though the partition function is invariant under @xmath78 .",
    "we stress here the fact that the absence of the medium effects in the topological zero mode sector resolves the unphysical suppression of the topological susceptibility of the original chrm model ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this form of @xmath79 may be understood physically as the fact that a topological zero mode localized near an ( anti- ) instanton is rather insensitive to the medium effects .    using the dirac operator ( [ e : dirac ] ) , we define the partition function of the chrm model with fixed @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath80 with a gaussian weight for the matrix @xmath63 .",

    "instead , we choose @xmath82 to be a binomial distribution@xcite , @xmath84 with parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the binomial distribution models the situation that , if we divide the four - volume @xmath74 into @xmath87 cells , an instanton appears in one of the cells with the probability @xmath86 , barring double occupancy .",

    "without such an extension , we find a simple termination of the pion condensed phase at large @xmath176 .",

    "on the other hand , once chiral and/or meson condensates become nonzero , they act as source terms for the other chiral condensates owing to the anomaly term @xmath213 , and therefore @xmath220 is no longer a solution .",
    "we confirmed numerically in the chrm model that two or more meson condensates do not appear in the ground state at the same time .",

    "the phase diagram of @xmath11 is different from that of @xmath8 because the anomaly term introduces the coupling among three flavors and we have a competition between the pion ( @xmath228ud ) and the kaon ( @xmath228ds or su ) condensed phases for being the ground state .",
    "below , we just assume that only one component of the meson condensates becomes nonzero in the meson condensed phase and leave its proof as an open issue - wave pion and kaon condensates in nuclear matter was studied previously@xcite . ] .",
    "preceding the numerical results , let us summarize three key points for qualitative understanding of the phase structure .",
    "\\(i ) _ analogy with the chiral sigma model _  as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the conventional chrm model for small chemical potentials and quark masses is equivalent to the zero momentum part of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "hence the phase structure of the chrm model in the small chemical potential region must have a similar structure as the chiral sigma model .",
    "it is known in the sigma model with @xmath11 that a second - order phase transition occurs from the ordinary chirally broken phase to the pion condensed phase or the kaon condensed phase at certain finite @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the critical chemical potential is roughly estimated as @xmath229 and @xmath230 for the pion and kaon condensations , respectively .",
    "there is a competition between the pion and kaon condensed phases for finite @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and the phase transition between the two is found to be first - order .",
    "we also remark that the state with two meson condensates having nonzero values can not be even a meta - stable state in this analysis .",
    "\\(ii ) _ chiral restoration _",
    " in contrast to the chiral sigma model , the chrm model includes the chiral restoration dynamics , which will result in a new kind of competition of two meson condensed phases in the region at large chemical potential .",
    "to illustrate the situation , let us consider the case in the chiral limit , where @xmath231 and the @xmath232-condensed phase @xmath233 with @xmath234 is chosen as the ground state .",
    "we now further increase @xmath1 with @xmath3 and @xmath2 fixed .",
    "this kaon condensed phase will simply remain as the ground state in the chiral sigma model . at sufficiently large @xmath1 , however , chiral or meson condensates involving the s - quark become disfavored and the chiral symmetry in the s - quark sector will presumably be restored .",
    "then there is a possibility for the remaining u- and d - quarks to form the pion condensate @xmath235 .",
    "we thus find a competition between the kaon condensed phase ( @xmath233 , @xmath234 ) and the pion condensed phase ( @xmath235 , @xmath236 ) at large @xmath1 .",
    "we will see shortly in this section that the pion - condensed phase is indeed favored at large @xmath1 .",
    "this competition exists also in the njl model@xcite , and we expect that this mechanism is common for the models exhibiting chiral symmetry restoration at large chemical potentials .",
    "\\(iii ) _ anomaly effect _  mixing of the order parameters due to the anomaly tends to unify chiral phase transitions into a single one as is seen in the case of @xmath8 . in the absence of the meson condensates , the anomaly term @xmath213 for @xmath11 reduces to @xmath237 , which couples three chiral condensates .",
    "when one of the chiral condensates melts away , the flavor mixing among the chiral condensates becomes small . with finite meson condensates",
    ", however , the anomaly term induces mixing among the chiral and the meson condensates .",
    "for example , once the pion condensate is formed @xmath238 with rotating @xmath120 and @xmath121 away , the mixing term @xmath239 becomes small but the term @xmath240 in eq .",
    "( [ e : pot_anom ] ) generates new flavor mixing . because of this mixing ,",
    "the chiral and pion condensates tend to vary cooperatively as the chemical potentials change .",
    "furthermore , the anomaly term makes the ground state with nonzero @xmath206 and @xmath207 condensates more stable as the term appears with a minus sign in the effective potential , which results in the extension of the meson condensed phase compared to the case without anomaly .     on @xmath2@xmath1 plane with @xmath188 in the chiral limit ( top ) and with nonzero quark masses",

    "different chemical potentials for different flavors are realized in general situations because of the quark mass differences and electric neutrality , and the chiral condensates have also different values there .",
    "moreover , when the chemical potential difference , which is flavor nonsinglet , becomes large and comparable to the pseudo - scalar meson masses , we have a phase transition to a meson condensed phase .",
    "we obtained a complex structure of the phase diagram with various orderings at first sight .",
    "nevertheless , we can understand the diagram qualitatively based on the following three observations .",
    "the first point is the similarity to the chiral lagrangian analysis , which explains the phase structure well below the chiral restoration . in the chiral limit for @xmath8 , the chiral condensed phase and the pion condensed phase",
    "are degenerated at @xmath245 , and an infinitesimal @xmath2 rotates the chiral condensates into the pion condensate . with finite quark masses",
    "the chiral condensed phase survives up to @xmath270 , and we find a second - order phase transition to the pion condensed phase . in the @xmath11 case , a similar behavior is also found for meson condensations , but in addition we found a new competition between the pion and kaon condensed phases , bounded by a first - order phase transition .",
    "the second point concerns the chiral restoration , whose effect is not included in the chiral lagrangian analysis . for @xmath8 and 3",
    ", we found that the pion and kaon condensates disappear continuously at large @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively , while the phase transitions along the @xmath3 axis are first - order .",
    "the chiral restoration effect explains the peculiar appearance of the pion and the kaon condensed phases in the phase diagram for @xmath11 . in the chiral lagrangian analysis ,",
    "the pion condensation is always favored if @xmath249 .",
    "however when @xmath2 is further increased , the chiral restoration for u - quark should occur and the pion condensation melts away .",
    "then the kaon condensation will be formed if the difference between @xmath168 and @xmath201 is larger than a certain critical value characterized by @xmath20 .",
    "this argument also holds in the situation where @xmath250 with exchanging the pion and kaon condensates .",
    "this is a remarkable inversion of the pion and kaon condensation at high @xmath2 or @xmath1 .",
    "note that the argument does not depend on the details of the chrm model .",
    "the same inversion may be found in other models which incorporate the chiral restoration dynamics , and therefore one may expect this also in qcd .    the third point is about the anomaly effect .",
    "the most important effect is the mixing of the condensates . for @xmath8 with finite quark masses",
    ", we find a single phase transition from the chiral condensed phase to the symmetric phase along the @xmath3 axis . without the flavor mixing ,",
    "the u- and d - quarks would show the chiral transitions independently at finite @xmath2 .",
    "but these two phase transitions coalesce into a single transition via the flavor mixing term due to the u(1)@xmath0  anomaly .",
    "there is the threshold @xmath2 for two - step phase transition , which becomes large if the anomaly parameters are increased .    in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "the anomaly effect induces the mixing among not only the chiral condensates , but also the meson condensates , which makes likely that the meson condensate and the chiral condensate of the remaining flavor show the discontinuity simultaneously as the chemical potentials are varied . in the mean - field models without the anomaly effect , where the flavor mixing is missing",
    ", the chiral phase transitions can happen in multi steps for finite @xmath2 and/or @xmath1 even when the quarks have an equal mass .",
    "we expect that the chiral condensates are strongly correlated in qcd because of the anomaly mixing as well as the dynamics beyond the mean field , and it is unlikely to have the multi - step chiral restoration in qcd when @xmath3 is increased with @xmath2 and @xmath1 being not too large . for large @xmath2 and/or @xmath1 ,",
    "however , there remains a possibility for chiral restoration to occur in multi steps , as shown in our model study .",
    "the chrm model , which discards the space - time dynamics but keeps the chiral symmetry only , is certainly a simplified model for qcd and will provide at most qualitative features of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "we have studied the response of the condensates to the chemical potentials using this chrm model with the u(1)@xmath0  anomaly , and found interesting interplay between the chiral and meson condensates as well as the importance of the u(1)@xmath0  anomaly effects .",

    "<S> phase diagram of the chiral random matrix model with u(1)@xmath0  breaking term is studied with the quark chemical potentials varied independently at zero temperature , by taking the chiral and meson condensates as the order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although , without the u(1)@xmath0  breaking term , chiral transition of each flavor can happen separately responding to its chemical potential , the u(1)@xmath0  breaking terms mix the chiral condensates and correlate the phase transitions . in the three flavor case , we find that there are mixings between the meson and chiral condensates due to the u(1)@xmath0  anomaly , which makes the meson condensed phase more stable . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the hypercharge chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) with the isospin and quark chemical potentials ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) kept small , we observe that the kaon condensed phase becomes the ground state and at the larger @xmath1 the pion condensed phase appears unexpectedly , which is caused by the competition between the chiral restoration and the meson condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the similar happens when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are exchanged , and the kaon condensed phase becomes the ground state at larger @xmath2 below the full chiral restoration . </S>"
