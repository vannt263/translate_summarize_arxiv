    "this newly discovered abundance of substructure has generated much attention , as it qualitatively fits into the framework of a @xmath3 cold dark matter cosmology that envisions the formation of the galaxy via hierarchical merging .",
    "however , the lack of available full phase - space descriptions of the substructure limits our ability to properly model and quantify the merging history of our galaxy .",
    "it is certain that the formation and dynamical evolution of tidal streams and overdensities is strongly affected by the galactic potential , in addition to the characteristics of the stream s progenitor ( e.g. , johnston et al . 1999 ; murali & dubinski 1999 ) .",
    "these effects can not be properly modeled simply with projected positions on the sky , distances , and in some cases radial velocities .",
    "moreover , these tidal features can not be properly disentangled in regions of the sky where they overlap in projection .",
    "one such example is the region of the virgo stellar overdensity ( vod ) .",
    "this region , first noted by newberg et al .",

    "sa  103 is thus @xmath14 west of the vss center as defined by d06 . in this field",
    ", we were able to identify one rr lyrae star as a vss member for which the absolute proper motion is measured .",
    "this allows us to obtain a preliminary orbit for the vss .",

    "all details concerning the reduction process and the derivation of proper motions are presented . here , we only briefly mention the basics of this survey .",
    "each field covers @xmath16 , and makes use of photographic plates taken at three different epochs .",
    "the modern epoch consists of plates taken between 1996 and 1998 with the las campanas du pont 2.5 m telescope , the intermediate epoch consists of palomar observatory sky survey plates ( poss - i ) taken in the early fifties with the oschin schmidt 1.2 m telescope , and the old epoch consists of plates taken between 1909 and 1911 with the mount wilson 1.5 m telescope .",
    "the modern and old plates were measured with the yale pds microdensitometer . for the poss - i plates we have used scans done by both the space telescope institute ( the digitized sky survey ) and the us naval observatory . for sa  103",
    "we have used two du pont plates two overlapping poss - i fields , and one 60-inch mt . wilson plate .",
    "the region of sa  103 has complete sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) coverage .",
    "thus , by comparing with the dr7 data , our proper - motion catalog in sa  103 is @xmath17 complete at @xmath18 , and becomes @xmath19 complete at @xmath20 . the limiting magnitude for objects that have over a 80-year baseline ( i.e. , those that were measured on the mt .",
    "wilson plates ) is @xmath21 , with @xmath22 completeness at @xmath23 . for objects that are well - measured ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) , we obtain proper - motion errors of @xmath25 mas  yr@xmath26 , as shown in cd06 and casetti - dinescu et al . ( 2008 ) .",
    "all proper - motion units in this paper are mas  yr@xmath26 .    we have searched the vivas et al . catalogs to find matches with stars in our sa  103 field .",

    "rr  167 , classified as bailey type ab , in the vivas et al",
    ". catalogs in our field . rr  167 ( ( r.a . , dec . )",
    "= @xmath27 ) is located near the center of our field and , with an average magnitude @xmath28 , it is a well - measured star , with the proper motion derived from thirteen position measurements across 86 years . the same star is also listed in the k08 catalog .",
    "vivas et al .",
    "( 2006 ) determine a heliocentric distance of 16.9 kpc , while k08 a distance of 18.3 kpc .",
    "both studies estimate a @xmath29 uncertainty in the distances , therefore the distances agree within uncertainties .",
    "no radial velocity ( rv ) or metallicity information is provided for rr  167 in subsequent studies that focus on the vss .",
    "we have thus searched the sdss dr7 data for spectroscopic observations in sa  103 , and fortunately we have found that rr  167 had two spectra taken near minimum light ( phase 0.70 and 0.75 ) .",
    "the phases of the spectroscopic observations were calculated using the quest ephemeris which , for this star , was based on 30 epochs in the light curve . from these spectra , the systemic heliocentric radial velocity of the star was determined to be @xmath30 km  s@xmath26 using the procedure described in v08 , which consists of fitting the radial velocity curve of the well studied rr lyrae star x arietis . the 2 sdss radial velocities for rr  167 fit quite well the curve of x arietis ( rms of the fit = 3 km  s@xmath26 ) .",
    "the quoted error however includes the uncertainties due to possible variations from star to star in the slope of the radial velocity curve and the phase when the systemic velocity occurs . in the galactic rest frame",
    "the velocity is @xmath31 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "the metallicity was determined from the caii k and h@xmath32 , h@xmath33 , and h@xmath34 equivalent width using the procedure outlined in layden ( 1994 ) .",
    "the metallicity values derived from the two spectra are @xmath35 and @xmath36 . based on this metalicity ( @xmath37 )",
    "we have re - estimated the distance to rr  167 , and we obtain @xmath38 kpc , which is the value that we use for the orbit determination .",
    "the properties of stars in the vss as determined by previous studies are summarized below .",
    "d06 find a somewhat smaller mean velocity than subsequent studies , @xmath39 km  s@xmath26 from a sample of 6 rr lyrae and blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars , in perfect agreement with the other works ( duffau 2008 ) ] .",
    "the metallicity determined by d06 is [ fe / h ] = @xmath40 , with the vss having a significant metallicity spread ( @xmath41 dex ) intrinsic to the structure .",
    "n07 obtain @xmath42 km  s@xmath26 from data on f - type turnoff star , while p09 obtain @xmath43 km  s@xmath26 ( average of four rr lyrae stars ) , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath44 and @xmath45 for two stars with available metallicity estimates .",
    "the distance to stars in the vss sampled by d06 is 19 kpc , while n07 estimate a distance of 18 kpc . from the more recent study by v08 , the distance to vss ranges between 12 and 19 kpc .",
    "thus , the estimated distance , rv , and metallicity of rr  167 make it a very likely member of the vss .",
    "figure 1 shows the formal proper - motion errors as a function of @xmath46 magnitude for stars in sa  103 .",
    "rr  167 ( filled circle ) has formal errors within the range for stars at that particular magnitude .",
    "the proper - motion zero - point for an inertial reference frame is determined from the measurement of background galaxies as classified by sdss .",
    "we use 302 galaxies with measured proper motions less than 20 mas  yr@xmath26 and that had at least four positional measurements . to determine their mean and dispersion , we apply the probability - plot method ( hamaker 1978 ) using the inner @xmath47 of the proper - motion distribution . in our data",
    "we also have four rather faint qsos ( as identified from sdss dr5 , see schneider et al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath48 .",
    "the galaxies and qsos determinations agree within errors .",
    "we obtain a final zero point from the mean proper motions of the galaxies and the qsos , weighted by their formal errors .",
    "our final zero point is @xmath49 mas  yr@xmath26 and @xmath50 mas  yr@xmath26 .",
    "figure 2 shows absolute proper - motion diagrams ( i.e. , with the zero point applied such that galaxies are centered on 0,0 ) for stars ( left panel ) and galaxies ( right panel ) .",
    "rr  167 is the filled circle .",
    "the open circles in the galaxies diagram are the qsos .",
    "the absolute proper motion of rr  167 is @xmath51 mas  yr@xmath26 and @xmath52 mas  yr@xmath26 . here",
    ", the error is determined by adopting the median value for the error of a star with the magnitude of rr  167 , as seen in fig . 1 ( i.e. , 0.8 mas  yr@xmath26 ) , and adding in quadrature the error in the zero point determination .",
    "this is done to avoid underestimating the error by using the value formally obtained from the fit of positions as a function of time .",
    "clearly , rr  167 has a high proper motion , detected at the @xmath53 level .",
    "such a large proper motion for an object at @xmath54 kpc implies a very energetic orbit ( see next section ) .",
    "the proper motion corrected for the reflex solar motion is @xmath55 mas  yr@xmath26 and @xmath56 mas  yr@xmath26 .    to further explore the presence of vss debris in sa  103 we present observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and proper - motion diagrams , and compare with their besancon - model ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) equivalents .",
    "the top panels of figure 3 show the cmds of an area centered on sa  103 , and covering our @xmath16 area .",
    "the left panel shows all stars from dr7 , the middle panel shows the besancon model data , and the right the dr7 data for stars with available proper - motion measurements .",
    "the location of rr  167 is highlighted with a filled circle .",
    "the dashed line indicates the approximate limiting magnitude of our proper - motion data . the dr7 data exhibit a distinct main - sequence like overdensity , as well as a mild enhancement at the location of a corresponding horizontal branch .",
    "the sa  103 region has also been analyzed by p09 , who examined sdss data as well as their own @xmath57 starcounts , and found a clear stellar excess compared to the besancon - model starcounts in the turn - off region of the cmd ( their figs .",
    "13 and 14 - top panels ) .",
    "they also compared the region in sa  103 to other two regions , of which one , at r.a .",
    "@xmath58 , shows no stellar excess compared to the besancon model . to better characterize the stellar overdensity in sa  103",
    ", we overlay the fiducial sequence of globular cluster m  53 in fig .",
    "the fiducial sequence is constructed from the dr7 data , and is represented with a grey line in the top - left panel .",
    "m  53 has a metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath59 , and is located at a distance of 17.8 kpc ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "thus , it is representative of the vss population .",
    "the reddening in sa  103 is e(b - v ) = 0.026 , while at the location of m  53 , it is e(b - v ) = 0.021 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore , only small adjustments due to reddening had to be made to the fiducial sequence of m  53 in order to align it with the vss .",
    "we chose not to adjust the distance modulus , since our distance to rr  167 agrees with that of m  53 within errors .",
    "figure 3 shows that the vss closely follows m  53 s fiducial sequence ; it is slightly redder , and there are no bhb stars .",
    "this indicates that the vss is slightly more metal rich than m  53 , in agreement with the spectroscopic determinations that give a 0.2dex difference .",
    "the next step is to identify more likely vss candidates in our proper - motion field . in the well - measured regime ( @xmath25 mas  yr@xmath26 , @xmath60 )",
    "we expect very few stars .",
    "both k08 and vivas et al . (",
    "2004 ) have surveyed this region , and found only one rr lyrae star which is in keeping with our expectations from the proper - motion field",
    ". there could be several more red horizontal - branch stars , as the cmd appears to indicate , however without rv information it is difficult to confidently distinguish them from field stars .",
    "likewise , we expect very few giants . from m  53 s dr7 cmd ( within a 10-arcmin radius from the cluster center )",
    "we obtain a ratio of about three red giant - branch stars ( approximately from the tip to the subgiant region ) for each horizontal - branch star .",
    "thus , even along the giant branch we ca nt expect more than about ten vss stars .",
    "lacking rv information , the giant branch vss stars have the additional problem of being virtually impossible to distinguish from the @xmath61 field stars that inhabit the same band as the m  53 giant branch .",
    "the highest contrast between the vss and the galactic field where proper - motions are available is the subgiant and turnoff region , which is also where proper - motion errors are the largest .",
    "nevertheless , we have selected stars in this region to check the overall proper - motion distribution , and compare it to that predicted by the besancon model . the stars are selected within the rectangular box highlighted in the cmds of fig .",
    "3 . our data include 93 stars , while the besancon model predicts @xmath62 stars .",
    "note that while the besancon sample is complete , the data are not ( at @xmath63 , completeness is @xmath64 ) .",
    "the proper - motion distribution of our data is shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "3 , where formal error bars are included for each star . the middle panel shows the proper - motion density contour map of our data , while the left panel shows that of the besancon data convolved with 4 mas  yr@xmath26 error .",
    "reassuringly , in the observed data the region of peak density includes rr  167 .",
    "the besancon proper - motion distribution shows a density peak at a different location than that of rr  167 ; this peak is also lower than that of the observed distribution , which reflects the stellar overdensity found in this area .",
    "the velocity components in cylindrical coordinates @xmath65 are calculated using the rv , distance and proper motion listed above for rr  167 . using the dehnen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) peculiar velocity of the sun , at r@xmath66 = 8 kpc , and @xmath67 km  s@xmath26 , we obtain @xmath68 km  s@xmath26 .",
    "we have integrated the orbit in the johnston et al .",
    "( 1995 ) galactic potential , following the procedure described in dinescu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to estimate uncertainties in the orbital parameters .",
    "we obtain an orbit with a pericentric radius of @xmath69 kpc , an apocentric radius of @xmath70 kpc , and an eccentricity of @xmath71 .",
    "the orbital inclination is @xmath72 , derived as @xmath73 - sin@xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the angular momentum along the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk , and @xmath76 is the total angular momentum .",
    "the radial orbital period is @xmath77 gyr .",
    "these orbital elements rule out any association of the vss with sgr s orbit ( e.g. , dinescu et al . 2000 ; dinescu et al .",
    "in particular , examination of the three integrals of motion for the orbits of sgr and the vss shows that while the total orbital energy and angular momentum are not determined with sufficient precision for the vss to safely rule out its association with sgr , the @xmath78 differs at the @xmath79 level .",
    "the current location of the rr  167 is @xmath54 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "thus , the orbit obtained indicates that the stars in the vss are near pericenter .",
    "interestingly , the smallest distance for stars in the vss is estimated to be 12 kpc ( v08 ) . using this distance at the sky location of rr  167",
    ", we obtain a galactocentric distance of 14 kpc , which is in reasonable agreement with our determination for the pericentric radius of the orbit .",
    "although the uncertainty in the apocentric radius is rather large , owing to distance and proper - motion errors , it is apparent that the orbit is very eccentric and thus rather destructive for the parent satellite .",
    "disruption models of satellites on eccentric orbits indicate that tidal debris piles up preferentially at the turning points of an orbit ( e.g. , the disruption of sgr : law et al . 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , the vss structure is consistent with a pericentric density enhancement of a disrupted satellite on a highly eccentric orbit . while the orbit is somewhat uncertain , it is a highly energetic one , with an apocenter beyond 50 kpc .",
    "we show this orbit in figure 4 , along with that of sgr for comparison .",
    "since there are only six globular clusters beyond a galactocentric radius of 50 kpc , we searched for positional coincidence between the orbit of the vss and distant clusters .",
    "there is only one cluster that can be associated with this orbit , namely ngc 2419 which is 13 kpc away from the closest point in the vss orbit , integrated back in time for 5 gyrs .",
    "ngc  2419 is a well - known massive cluster with a low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath80 ) , and a very extended bhb . as such",
    ", its properties fit the idea that massive , extended bhb clusters are the nuclei of disrupted dwarf galaxies ( lee et al . 2007 ) .",
    "cluster ngc  2419 ( ( l , b ) = @xmath81 has been tentatively associated with debris from sgr by newberg et al .",
    "this association is based on the proximity of ngc  2419 to sgr s orbital plane , and on the finding of an overdensity of a - type stars ( assumed to be bhb stars ) at a galactocentric distance of @xmath2 kpc that lie near sgr s orbital plane toward the direction of ngc  2419 ( newberg et al .",
    "disruption models of sgr ( law et al . 2005 ) show that debris from sgr can be found in the region and at the galactocentric distance of ngc  2419 , as part of the trailing tail , thus suggesting that the cluster and the a - type star overdensity could belong to sgr . the low radial velocity of ngc  2419 , @xmath82 km  s@xmath26 ( harris 1996 ) indicates that the cluster is at a turning point in its orbit ( in this case the apocenter ) , which can be equally implied by the membership to sgr and vss ( fig .",
    "4 ) . since ngc  2419 is in the anticenter direction , only its transverse velocity can establish whether it is associated to any of these two streams .",
