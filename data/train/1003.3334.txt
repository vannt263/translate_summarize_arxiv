    ". an important feature of these experiments is the presence of a confining potential which traps the particles within a limited spatial region of the optical lattice created by laser - induced standing waves .",

    "we consider a power - law trapping potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive constants and @xmath10 is the trap size .",
    "experiments are usually set up with a harmonic potential , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "far from the origin the potential @xmath12 diverges , therefore @xmath13 vanishes and the particles are trapped .",
    "the inhomogeneity due to the trapping potential strongly affects the phenomenology of quantum transitions in homogeneous systems .",
    "the homogeneous bh model without trap undergoes mott insulator to superfluid quantum transitions driven by the chemical potential @xmath14 , whose low - energy properties are described by a",

    "u(1)-symmetric bosonic field theory  @xcite , which is characterized by the dynamic exponent @xmath15.-dimensional xy universality class  @xcite .",

    "] in the presence of a confining potential , theoretical and experimental results have shown the coexistence of mott insulator and superfluid regions when varying the total occupancy of the lattice , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , at fixed trap size , the system does not develop a critical behavior with a diverging length scale  @xcite .",
    "criticality can be recovered only in the limit of large trap size . as put forward in refs .",
    "@xcite , this critical regime can be described in the framework of the trap - size scaling ( tss ) theory , where the critical behavior is cast in the form a tss with a nontrivial trap exponent @xmath0 , which determines how the length scale of the critical modes at the critical point diverges with increasing trap size , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "for example , let us consider a standard scenario ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in which the quantum @xmath18 transition of the the homogeneous @xmath19-dimensional system has one relevant parameter @xmath14 , with critical value @xmath20 .",

    "the critical exponents entering the scaling formulas ( [ freee ] ) and ( [ gapscalgen ] ) are @xmath28 where @xmath9 is the power of the confining potential ( [ potential ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the quantum critical behaviors of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bh model at zero temperature in the presence of a confining potential , at the mott to superfluid transitions , and within the gapless superfluid phase .",
    "the 1d bh model in the presence of a confining potential is of experimental relevance in optical lattices , where quasi 1d confined particle systems have been realized , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider the hard - core limit , @xmath29 , of the 1d bh model , which allows us to study the effects of the confining potential by exact and very accurate numerical results .",
    "the hard - core limit implies that the particle number @xmath30 per site is restricted to the values @xmath31 . in this",

    ", the 1d hard - core bh model has three phases : two mott insulator phases , for @xmath40 with @xmath41 and for @xmath42 with @xmath43 , separated by a gapless superfluid phase for @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , there are two mott insulator to superfluid transitions at @xmath45 and @xmath46 . at both transitions",
    "the exponents controlling the critical behavior are those reported in eq.([critexps ] ) .",
    "the gapless superfluid phase is instead described by a free massless bosonic field theory with dynamic exponent @xmath16 , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effects of the confining potential at the low - density transition ( @xmath45 ) has been already studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where tss has been shown to emerge by analytical calculations exploiting the spinless fermion formulation of the 1d hard - core bh model .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of the trap - size dependence to all critical regions of its phase diagram .",
    "we present results for the trap - size dependence in the gapless superfluid region and at the @xmath2 mott insulator to superfluid transition .    for this purpose",
    "we exploit the free spinless fermion representation of the 1d hard - core bh model , which allows us to perform computations for very large systems , since they only require the diagonalization of a @xmath47 matrix where @xmath48 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "we obtain numerical results for chains of size @xmath48 , with a trap of size @xmath49 centered in the middle of the chain ( unless explicitly stated , we consider odd @xmath48s so that the middle of the trap coincides with the middle site of the chain ) ; we choose @xmath48 large enough to have negligible finite-@xmath48 effects ; we are able to obtain results correct to machine precision for @xmath49 up to @xmath50 .",
    "we then analyze the quantum critical behaviors in the presence of the trap within the framework of the tss theory .",
    "the trap - size dependence shows subtle effects in the parameter region where the homogeneous model without trap has a nonzero filling @xmath1 , i.e. , for @xmath51 , therefore in the superfluid region and at the @xmath2 mott transition .",
    "this is essentially related to the presence of level crossings at finite trap size .",
    "they arise because the particle number is conserved , i.e. , the particle number operator @xmath52 commutes with the bh hamiltonian ( [ bhm ] ) even in the presence of the trapping potential ; thus the eigenvectors do not depend on @xmath14 , even though the eigenvalues do . in the presence of the trapping potential ( [ potential ] ) , the particle number @xmath53 is finite and increases as @xmath54 with increasing the trap size @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath55 , there is an infinite number of ground - state level crossings where @xmath56 jumps by 1 and the gap @xmath57 vanishes .",
    "as we shall see , this phenomenon gives rise to a new interesting scenario at the @xmath2 mott transition , requiring a revision of the tss ansatz ( [ freee ] ) and ( [ gapscalgen ] ) into a _ modulated _ tss : the tss is still controlled by the trap - size exponent @xmath58 , as in the case of the low - density mott transition , but it gets modulated by periodic functions of the trap size .",
    "we provide numerical evidence of universality at the low - density and @xmath2 mott transitions by considering a more general 1d hard - core bh model with nearest - neighbor density - density interactions , corresponding to the so - called xxz model .",
    "since the corresponding fermion representation is not longer quadratic , the numerical results are obtained by using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods .",
    "we also show that the trap - size dependence in the gapless superfluid phase is characterized by power - law asymptotic behaviors which are modulated by periodic functions of the trap size .",
    "moreover , it shows a multiscale behavior characterized by different length scales diverging with different power laws with increasing trap size , associated with the smooth modes and with the modes at the fermi momentum @xmath59 .",
