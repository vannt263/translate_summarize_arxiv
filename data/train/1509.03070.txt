    "<S> the wilson loop operator is a global operator that distinguishes different topological degenerate ground states , and can be obtained as follows : first create a pair of spinons , then wind them around the torus or infinite cylinder , and finally annihilate them . </S>",
    "<S> then the expectation value of the wilson loop operator for the two topologically degenerate ground states ( @xmath68 ) is @xmath69 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kagome_csl](a ) ] . from our microscopic lattice gauge theory </S>",
    "<S> , the wilson loop corresponds to a gauge flux around the non - contractible loop along the @xmath70 direction ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kagome_csl](b ) ) : @xmath71 @xmath72 represents a projection into the classically degenerate manifold . </S>",
    "<S> technically , the projection can be treated as a renormalization , and approximated by : @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically we find that @xmath74 , which is close to the above theoretical expectation .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ anisotropic - kagome - xxz - model ] ] anisotropic kagome xxz model : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we finally discuss the relevance of our findings for the extended kagome xxz model @xcite @xmath75 with first neighbor @xmath76 @xmath6 interactions , second- @xmath77 and third- @xmath78 neighbor @xmath79 interactions ( see fig .

    "<S> an interesting observation is that its gmf hamiltonian can be written as the product of correlated hopping terms ( see supplemental materials ) : @xmath84 \\nonumber \\\\   & -j'_{xy } \\sum_{\\langle i k\\rangle , \\langle j l \\rangle \\in \\hexagon }   \\chi^a_{ij , k } \\chi^b_{kl , j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use a generalized form of correlated hopping , @xmath85 and similarly for @xmath86 . here </S>",
    "<S> we do not require site @xmath87 to be the nearest neighbor of site @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is reasonable to expect that a finite @xmath90 could induce a spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking with @xmath91 , and result in a @xmath0 spt phase ( in the gmf hamiltonian ) as in the correlated hopping model @xcite . with the help of idmrg simulations </S>",
    "<S> we find that this is indeed true for systems with sufficiently large @xmath92 ( see supplemental materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example the order parameter @xmath93 for the time - reversal symmetry breaking is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xxz ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the csl in the kagome xxz model can also be explained as a gauged @xmath0 spt following our construction .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ conclusion ] ] conclusion : + + + + + + + + + + +    we have achieved a theoretical understanding of recent numerically discovered chiral spin liquids in kagome antiferromagnets , which turns out to be a gauged @xmath0 symmetry protected topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> it is a rare example that starting from a microscopic model , a ( non-@xmath1 ) spin liquid phase can be described in a controlled way in two spatial dimensions , via a faithful gauge theoretic model accounting for the qsl as its deconfined phase . </S>",
    "<S> this framework might be applicable to numerous interesting problems , such as solving the precise nature of the kagome spin liquid as well as realizing exotic topological phases through the  gauging \" procedure in related kagome systems or doped quantum dimer models . </S>",
