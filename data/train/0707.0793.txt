    "in a previous work @xcite , we derived the microcanonical partition function of an ideal relativistic quantum gas of spinless bosons within a quantum field theoretical framework . therein , we confined ourselves to the microcanonical ensemble with fixed energy and momentum . here , we will obtain the partition function of the microcanonical ensemble of an ideal relativistic quantum gas with fixed energy - momentum _ and _ angular momentum .",
    "it should be pointed out from the very beginning that , for a quantum system , energy - momentum and angular momentum can be defined simultaneously only in the rest frame , i.e. if @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , more rigorously , one should rather speak of fixing the maximal set of commuting observables of the orthochronous poincar group io(1,3)@xmath1 , including energy - momentum and two observables formed out of the pauli - lubanski vector .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we will retain the more colloquial expressions of `` energy - momentum and angular momentum conservation '' or ",
    "microcanonical ensemble with angular momentum conservation \" being understood that we are working in the system rest frame , where the pauli - lubanski vector is proportional to the intrinsic angular momentum or spin of the system .",
    "the microcanonical partition function of an ideal relativistic quantum gas with fixed angular momentum , in a full quantum field theoretical framework , has never been derived for particles with spin .",
    "it has been obtained in an essentially non - relativistic quantum mechanical framework in ref .",
    "@xcite and an equivalent calculation has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a projection method , yet only for spinless particles . with the same limitations , an expression with angular momentum conservation , but without momentum conservation has been derived by koba  @xcite .",
    "the classical limit has been worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we will get over these limitations and derive the microcanonical partition function of the ideal relativistic quantum gas of particles with spin by using a group theoretical approach including the maximal set of observables pertaining to space - time symmetries , i.e. energy - momentum , spin , and parity , in a consistent way in a quantum field framework .",
    "like in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will write it as an expansion over fixed multiplicities .    the most general expression will be used to work out special cases , such as the grand - canonical ( fixed temperature ) and the classical limit .",
    "we will show that those , more familiar , expressions , can be recovered , thus supporting the correctness of our approach .      in this paper",
    "we adopt the natural units , with @xmath2 .",
    "space - time linear transformations ( translations , rotations , boosts ) and sl(2,c ) transformations are written in serif font , e.g. @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "operators in hilbert space will be denoted by a hat , e.g. @xmath5 .",
    "the only exception to this rule are field operators , which will be written as a capital @xmath6 , while c - numbers field functions with a small @xmath7 .",
    "also unit vectors will be denoted with an upper hat , but they will always be referred to explicitely in the text .",
    "in order to calculate the microcanonical partition function of an ideal relativistic quantum gas fixing the maximal set of observables pertaining to space - time symmetries , the use of group theory is both essential and enlightening .",
    "the statement of the problem in this framework has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , generalizing known projection operator techniques used for internal , rather than space - time , symmetries , and we will outline it here .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the microcanonical partition function of a relativistic system can be written as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are a complete set of states for the localized problem ( the quantum field in a compact region ) and @xmath10 is a projector operator which selects the quantum states with the fixed values of the physical observables ; @xmath11 is , by definition , the entropy .",
    "if only energy - momentum is involved , the relevant symmetry group is t(4 ) and the projector reads : @xmath12 although @xmath13 is not a proper projector because @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a divergent constant we will maintain this naming even for these non - idempotent operators relaxing mathematical rigour .    similarly , for the maximal set of observables , the projection @xmath10 should be made onto irreducible states @xmath16 of the full symmetry group , namely the orthocronous poincar group io(1,3)@xmath1 .",
    "these states can be built by diagonalizing operators or combinations of operators of the poincar algebra .",
    "the first casimir is the squared four - momentum @xmath17 with eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "the construction of physical states depends on whether @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "we will consider only the former case , i.e. massive particles , and stick to the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite for the definition of spin , that we will briefly outline .",
    "first , the pauli - lubanski vector is formed : @xmath21 @xmath22 being the generators of the lorentz group , with the following properties : @xmath23 = 0 \\\\ \\nonumber & & [ \\hat w_\\mu , \\hat w_\\nu ] = -i \\sum_{\\rho \\sigma }    \\epsilon_{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma } \\hat w^\\rho \\hat p^\\sigma \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\hat w \\cdot \\hat p = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in view of the first commutation relation , if @xmath24 is an eigenvector of @xmath25 , so is @xmath26 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath27 to the eigenspace labelled by four - momentum @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 . since @xmath30",

    "the third component @xmath35 can be diagonalized along with @xmath36 which is a casimir of the full group io(1,3)@xmath1 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath37 and @xmath38 . with a suitable choice of @xmath39 ,",
    "i.e. : @xmath40e_i \\qquad [ p ] \\equiv { \\sf r}_3(\\varphi ) { \\sf r}_2 ( \\theta )    { \\sf l}_3(\\xi)\\ ] ] @xmath41 being the unit vectors of spacial axes and @xmath42 $ ] being a lorentz transformation bringing the timelike vector @xmath43 into the four - momentum @xmath28 with polar coordinates @xmath44 ; the eigenvalue @xmath37 has the physical meaning of the component of intrinsic angular momentum in the rest frame along the direction of particle momentum @xmath45 .",
    "thus , with the choice ( [ choi ] ) , @xmath37 is the helicity in the rest frame and @xmath46 is , by definition , _ the _ spin of the particle . since , from eqs .",
    "( [ spins ] ) , ( [ luba2 ] ) and ( [ luba ] ) @xmath47 , the spin operators in the rest frame coincide with the generators of the rotation groups .",
    "the inclusion of parity adds another discrete quantum number @xmath48 to the maximal set of eigenvalues .",
    "altogether , an irreducible state of the this group can be labelled by a four - momentum @xmath28 , a spin @xmath46 , its third component @xmath37 and parity @xmath48 and the projector onto such state @xmath10 can then be written as : @xmath49 generalizing the known integral expression for compact groups , one can formally write the projector ( [ progen ] ) as an integral over the poincar group : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the invariant group measure , @xmath52 is the identity or space inversion @xmath53 , @xmath54 io(1,3)@xmath1 , @xmath55 is the matrix of the unitary irreducible representation @xmath56 the state @xmath16 belongs to and @xmath57 is the unitary representation of @xmath58 in the hilbert space . like for the energy - momentum projector ( [ t4 ] ) ,",
    "the expression ( [ proj ] ) is not , strictly speaking , a projector because the group io(1,3)@xmath1is non - compact and @xmath59 with @xmath15 divergent constant .",
    "however , we will keep calling ( [ proj ] ) a projector relaxing mathematical rigor . working in the rest frame of the system , with @xmath60 , the matrix element @xmath61 vanishes",
    "unless lorentz transformations are pure rotations and this implies the reduction of the integration in ( [ proj ] ) from io(1,3)@xmath1 to @xmath62 @xcite ( replacing so(3 ) with its universal covering group su(2 ) ) .",
    "the general transformation of the orthochronous poincar group @xmath58 may be then factorized as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a translation by the four - vector @xmath65 , @xmath66 is either the identity or the space inversion and @xmath67 is a general orthochronous lorentz transformation written as the product of a boost of hyperbolic angle @xmath68 along the space - like axis @xmath69 and a rotation @xmath70 depending on three euler angles .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ proj ] ) becomes : @xmath71 where @xmath72 if @xmath73 and @xmath74 if @xmath75 . in the above equation ,",
    "the invariant measure @xmath76 of the translation subgroup has been normalized with a coefficient @xmath77 in order to yield a dirac delta , as shown later .",
    "furthermore , @xmath78 is the invariant normalized measure of the lorentz group , which can be written as @xcite : @xmath79 @xmath80 being the invariant measure of su(2 ) group normalized to 1 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the angular coordinates of the unit vector @xmath69 .    in the rest frame of the system , where @xmath83 , lorentz transformations @xmath84 comprising any non - trivial boost ( i.e. with @xmath85 ) would make the matrix element @xmath86 vanish .",
    "therefore @xmath84 reduces to the rotation @xmath3 and ( [ propro ] ) to : @xmath87 where we now use the ordinary symbol @xmath88 to denote matrices of su(2 ) unitary representations .",
    "the irreducible representations of this group are now labelled by eigenvalues of its generators @xmath89 and @xmath90 which coincide with the spin @xmath46 and its third component @xmath37 defined above by means of operators @xmath91 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath92 = 0 $ ] , we can move the @xmath93 operator to the right of @xmath94 and recast the above equation as : @xmath95 @xmath48 being the parity of the system .",
    "( [ final ] ) is indeed the final general expression of the projector defining the proper microcanonical ensemble with @xmath96 , where all conservation laws related to space - time symmetries are implemented .",
    "the nice feature of the above expression is the factorization of projections onto the energy - momentum @xmath28 , spin - helicity @xmath97 and parity @xmath48 which allows us to calculate the contribution of angular momentum and energy - momentum conservation separately .",
    "the microcanonical partition function ( mpf ) ( [ micropf1 ] ) can be written also as , by inserting a resolution of identity @xmath98 : @xmath99\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the projector onto localized states @xmath9 and @xmath101 defined in sect .  2 .",
    "@xcite , we argued that @xmath102 can be written , in its most general form , in a field theoretical framework as a functional integral over eigenstates @xmath103 of the ( scalar charged ) quantum field : @xmath104 where the field function @xmath105 is some arbitrary function outside the region @xmath106 to denote the system region and its volume . ] . in the functional integration ( [ pv1 ] )",
    ", the index @xmath106 implies that integrated field variables are just those in @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath107 . with this definition ,",
    "spurious terms depending on the degrees of freedom outside @xmath106 are introduced which must be subtracted `` by hand '' in a consistent way .",
    "this means that no contribution arising from these degrees of freedom should be retained at the end of the calculation @xcite .",
    "the quantum field theoretical approach was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to be essential for small volumes , because localized states are in principle a superposition of states with different number of particles ( meant as asymptotic states of the free field defined over the whole space ) .",
    "the approximation of assuming localized states having a well - defined number of particles is expected to be a good one only when the size of the region is much larger than compton wavelength . yet ,",
    "the final expression of the microcanonical partition function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite only differs by that calculated with the aforementioned approximation by an immaterial constant factor , after due subtraction of spurious terms . in this work",
    ", we will extend this result to particles with spin , that is to non - scalar fields .    as a first step ,",
    "the mpf @xmath108 is expressed as an expansion over all possible _",
    "channels_. by channel we mean a set of particle multiplicities for each species , that is a set of integers @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the total number of species . in formula",

    "writing @xmath113 where by @xmath114 we label the set of kinematical variables ( momenta and spins ) of the free fock space state @xmath115 , the microcanonical weight of the channel @xmath116 reads : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is defined as the _ microcanonical state weight_. it is now useful to insert a resolution of the identity in @xmath118 by using again the completeness of a set of fock space states @xmath119 : @xmath120 and work out the matrix elements @xmath121 and @xmath122 separately .",
    "it is easy to realize that @xmath10 in ( [ omega ] ) can not change the multiplicities of the ket @xmath123 .",
    "this can be seen from its integral expression ( [ final ] ) : translation , rotations and reflections can not change the number of particles of the state vector they are acting upon . therefore , in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) @xmath124 and : @xmath125 we will start our derivation of the mpf by considering the projector @xmath126 without parity fixing , which will be addressed in sect .  10 . according to eq .",
