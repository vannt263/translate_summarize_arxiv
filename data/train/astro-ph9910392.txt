    "the observed total radial velocity of a galaxy ( found from the redshift ) can be separated into two distinct parts : a cosmological part , from the expansion of the universe , and a peculiar motion associated with the galaxy proper motion .",
    "measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities on large scales reveal the underlying mass density fluctuations , since galaxies will stream towards an overdense region and away from an underdense region .    to determine peculiar motions , a distance - indicator relation has to be used to find redshift - independent distances to galaxies .",
    "the tully - fisher relation can be used for spiral galaxies .",
    "elliptical galaxies have been found to populate a nearly planar region in the three - dimensional space defined by the central velocity dispersion , the effective ( half - luminosity ) radius , and the effective surface brightness ; this region is called the fundamental plane ( lucey @xmath0 @xmath1 1991 ; j@xmath7rgensen @xmath0 @xmath1 1993 ) . the fundamental plane ( fp )",
    "method for distance determination is an improvement on the @xmath9 relation .",
    "it has a tighter correlation ; therefore , a better precision in distances ( @xmath5 20% ) can be achieved ( j@xmath7rgensen @xmath0 @xmath1 1996 ; scodeggio @xmath0 @xmath1 1997 ) .",
    "galaxy peculiar velocities are found from a comparison of the distances with the measured redshifts .",
    "there is strong observational evidence for the existence of large - scale flows in the local universe , induced by gravity ( see strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation provides a natural velocity reference frame for the analysis of galaxy motions .",
    "the dipole anisotropy , determined from cobe , implies that the local group ( lg ) moves with respect to the cmb rest frame at 627 @xmath10 22 km  s@xmath6 towards @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( kogut @xmath0 @xmath1 1993 ) .",
    "if this has a kinematic origin then , sufficiently far away , galaxy peculiar velocities should converge to the cmb frame . until now , the only studies which have reported measurements of the velocity field as far out as 15  000 km  s@xmath6 are those of lauer & postman ( lp ) ( 1994 ) , using brightest cluster galaxies as distance indicators , and riess @xmath0 @xmath1 ( 1995 ) , using type ia supernovae .",
    "lp checked the convergence of the lg dipole motion to the cmb dipole , with a surprising result : a strong signature of a very large - scale bulk flow was seen , with an amplitude of 689 @xmath10 178 km  s@xmath6 in the direction @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the lp study implies that the local rest frame fails to converge to the cmb frame , even in regions with radii @xmath5 15  000 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "a bulk flow with the statistical significance of this result rules out a whole series of cosmological models at the @xmath15% confidence level ( feldman & watkins 1994 ; strauss @xmath0 @xmath1 1995 ) ; the lp result is in disagreement with all viable models at present .",
    "the lp sample extended to 15  000 km  s@xmath6 , with an effective depth of @xmath16 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the logical next step was to compare the lp result with peculiar velocities as found from applying the tully - fisher and fp methods to galaxies extending further out than any previous peculiar velocity studies . from tully - fisher studies of field and cluster spiral galaxies within 8000",
    "km  s@xmath6 , giovanelli @xmath0 @xmath1 ( 1996 , 1998a , 1998b ) concluded that these galaxies do not show any evidence of such a bulk flow . in order to investigate the reality of large - scale streaming motion on scales of up to 150  mpc , we have studied the peculiar motions of 179 early - type galaxies in three directions of the south equatorial strip , at distances out to @xmath5 20  000  km  s@xmath6",
    "we have obtained new and independent measurements of the peculiar velocity field of elliptical field galaxies at a depth similar to that of lp , using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic data . for further details of the project ,",
    "see mller ( 1997 ) ; the results for peculiar motions are analysed in mller @xmath0 @xmath1 ( 1998 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the spectroscopic data used in our study of the large - scale motions . > from the spectra , galaxy redshifts were measured , and central velocity dispersions were obtained ",

    "9 is a histogram of the fractional errors in @xmath20 for 29 repeat observations .",
    "the rms scatter in @xmath28 is 0.103 , which means that @xmath20 can be determined to 10% accuracy .",
    "the galaxies for which there are repeat measurements are typical of those in the whole sample , so these estimated errors are representative of the true errors .        results for redshifts were compared with values from ned ( madore @xmath0 @xmath1 1992 ) and from the zcat compilation of redshifts ( huchra @xmath0 @xmath1 1992 ) , and the differences were found to be relatively small .",
    "redshift comparisons were possible for 32 standard galaxies and 20 sample galaxies .",
    "( redshifts were available for only a small fraction of the galaxies in the sample regions , since the south equatorial strip had not been well studied before . )    the determinations of radial velocity for these two sets of galaxies were compared with redshifts from the literature , and the results are shown in fig .",

    "this shows that the redshifts are of adequate reliability .",
    "in order to make sure that the values of velocity dispersions determined here are scaled to the standard system , the results for the velocity dispersions of standard galaxies were compared with published values .",

    "j@xmath7rgensen @xmath0 @xmath1 ( 1995 ) , which are the most recent data sets , although the numbers of galaxies in common are smaller .",
    "we have obtained new radial velocities and central velocity dispersions for 179 e and s0 galaxies in three selected directions in the apm south equatorial strip , as well as for 40 galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "observations were made with the 2.4  m and 1.3  m telescopes of the mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona , using the mark iii spectrograph , and at the 4.4  m mmt , using the red channel .",
