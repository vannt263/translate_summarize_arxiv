    "experimental indications@xcite of noticeable electron - phonon ( e - ph ) effects in the superconducting cuprates have revived the discussion of the interplay of e - ph and electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions .",
    "this issue has obviously a broader relevance , as both interaction mechanisms are important also in materials like fullerenes@xcite and manganites@xcite .",
    "the wealth of experiments available for the cuprates underscores quite a puzzling scenario where the fingerprints of e - ph interaction are strikingly different than in weakly correlated materials .",
    "in fact , while some quantities seem to be affected by phonons even more than in ordinary metals , particularly in the underdoped regime ( photoemission spectra @xcite , penetration depth and superfluid density@xcite ) , others are almost insensitive to phonons , like resistivity . such a situation",
    "is ultimately related to the presence of several energy scales in strongly correlated materials , which makes it compelling the use of nonperturbative approaches .",
    "several nonperturbative methods have been indeed applied to different models with both e - e and e - ph interactions . among those ,",
    "we can count fully numerical approaches such as various kinds of quantum monte carlo@xcite , exact diagonalization@xcite and density - matrix renormalization group@xcite , the semi - analytical dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite , and approximate analytical results based on large - n expansions@xcite .",
    "each of this approaches has its own advantages , and typical range of validity .",
    "an analysis of the recent literature seems to uncover an unclear scenario , since some calculations conclude an enhanced role of e - ph interaction in the presence of correlations,@xcite and others suggest exactly an opposite situation.@xcite an important part of those discrepancies can be attributed to the different physical regimes in which the investigations have been performed ( e.g. , antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic phase ) , but another part is probably due to the numerical character of the previous analyses which does not elucidate enough the underlying physical mechanisms . in the present paper ,",
    "we try to build a more analytical understanding for the correlated metal at and near half - filling and compare with the results obtained using dmft in the same regime near the mott transition.@xcite dmft is the quantum version of mean - field theories , that freezes spatial fluctuations but fully retains local dynamics .",
    "the method has been recently used to study the effects of e - ph interaction close to the mott metal - insulator transition in the hubbard - holstein model .",
    "@xcite in particular in ref .",
    ", it has been shown that , close to the mott transition , e - ph interaction manifests in a different way in low- and high - energy properties .",
    "while the high - energy hubbard bands are affected by e - ph coupling , the low - energy quasiparticle physics is to some extent  protected \" against the phonon effects by e - e correlation .",
    "the main effect of e - ph interaction is indeed the reduction of the repulsive @xmath0 leading to an effective interaction which can be parameterized in a simple way . since dmft still requires numerical calculations which sometimes make it difficult to disentangle different effects , it is instructive to compare approximate analytical methods with dmft in order to gain insight into the physical picture arising from the latter method .    to this purpose",
    "we present here a mean - field picture of the hubbard - holstein model , following a recent suggestion by perroni _",
    "_ @xcite . from one side",
    "we exploit the ability of the slave - boson mean - field approach@xcite to capture the main features of the hubbard model in the strongly correlated regime . to treat the phonon degrees of freedom we use a variational lang - firsov transformation@xcite , that has been introduced to describe the effects of e - ph interaction both in the weak- and strong - coupling regimes@xcite . to this end one",
    "introduces a  rotation \" parameter @xmath1@xcite , defined below , which measures the degree of polaron formation .",
    "slave - boson approaches have been recently performed@xcite , in a similar spirit of the present paper , to gain insight on the quantum monte carlo results of ref .",
    ", proposing that , in a range of correlation values , the small momentum e - ph vertex can be enhanced by increasing the repulsion ( yet being smaller than the bare one ) .",
    "the studies of refs .",
    "suggest that the enhancement of the vertex could be related to a finite - temperature signature of a zero - temperature phase separation .",
    "our approach here follows the spirit of those calculations ( namely the use of simplified approaches to gain insight into more involved calculations ) but focuses on a slightly different subject , such as the  protection \" of low - energy degrees of freedom from e - ph effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ method ] we introduce the model and derive the general mean - field equations for the paramagnetic homogeneous phase . in section",
    "[ results ] , after a brief summary of the most important results for the half - filling case within the present approach@xcite , we extend the analysis of the mean - field solutions to the strongly correlated small - doping regime and discuss the evolution from weak to strong e - ph coupling , with particular attention to the way electronic properties are modified .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and acknowledgments .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard - holstein model reads : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a nearest - neighbor hopping term , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath6 at the site @xmath7 while @xmath8 is the local density operator .",
    "the operator @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) creates ( destroys ) a phonon at the site @xmath7 with energy @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameterizes the coupling between electrons and local displacements . in what follows",
    "we will introduce the adiabaticity parameter @xmath13 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath14 , which measures the strength of the e - ph interaction . here",
    "@xmath15 is a factor depending only on the dimensionality and the topology of the lattice defined by the expression of the non - interacting kinetic energy _ at half filling _ , @xmath16 .",

    "we expect @xmath19 to be equal to one in the antiadiabatic regime , where the standard lang - firsov transformation applies , and equal to zero in the adiabatic regime where the born - oppenheimer approximation holds .",
    "averaging @xmath20 on the vacuum state of the transformed phonons we obtain a purely fermionic hubbard - like model with phonon - dependent renormalizations of the kinetic and correlation terms and with a rescaling of the chemical potential , all of which are controlled by the variational parameters @xmath19 .    the effective electronic model is then solved within the kotliar - ruckenstein slave - bosons technique@xcite . for each site",
    "we introduce four bosons @xmath21 , representing the four possible states on site @xmath7 ( zero , two and one @xmath6 electron state ) , and a fermionic operator @xmath22 which is connected to the original electron operator by the relation @xmath23 , where @xmath24 the equivalence with the original hilbert space is guaranteed by the constraints @xmath25 which can be enforced introducing three lagrange multipliers @xmath26 .",

    "this finding is easily interpreted in terms of renormalized interaction @xmath53 and renormalized kinetic energy @xmath54 , showing that the value of the parameter @xmath1 determines to what extent the electronic properties are affected by phonons .",

    "we are now in the position to discuss the effect of e - ph interaction on the correlation - driven mott transition at @xmath56 .",

    "( [ eq : f ] ) , we find @xmath60@xcite , while @xmath39 is recovered for large @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , while in the antiadiabatic limit the e - ph coupling strongly reduces both the coulomb repulsion and the kinetic term , in the adiabatic regime , the small value of @xmath1 makes the effect of e - ph smaller on both quantities . in this regime",
    "the exponential factor is closer to one , since the phonons are less effective in reducing the electron mobility , and , noticeably , @xmath61 , in remarkable quantitative agreement with dmft results @xcite . for small @xmath59 the line marking the mott transition in the @xmath62-u diagram",
    "is then given by @xmath63 , and reproduces accurately previous diagrams obtained by dmft@xcite .",
    "the increase of the critical @xmath0 as a function of e - ph interaction results from the two renormalizations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "because both effects are essential to get the agreement with the dmft result at @xmath66 , we expect them to be important also at finite @xmath44 .",

    "( [ sol : f ] ) with the mean - field theory of the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "we will see that @xmath1 , @xmath59 and @xmath62 play the roles of the magnetization , temperature and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the mean - field equation has the form @xmath77 and can be solved graphically just like the curie - weiss equation .",
    "@xmath78 varies from 0 to 1 , so that @xmath1 takes physically meaningful values .",
    "@xmath79 is different from zero for any finite value of @xmath59 and @xmath80 .",

    "the inflection point is at small @xmath1 , so that @xmath78 crosses @xmath1 in three points , while for larger @xmath59 only one intersection survives as the inflection point moves toward large @xmath1 . @xmath59",
    "clearly plays a role similar to the temperature , with a critical value @xmath81 which separates the two regimes . the critical point ( @xmath82 ) may be evaluated analytically by imposing @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , which in the limit @xmath86 give the critical values @xmath87 ,",
    "@xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "when three solutions exist , we find two locally stable solutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 associated to weaker and stronger effective e - ph interaction .",
    "the two solutions correspond to negative and positive magnetization in the ferromagnetic terminology .",
    "notice that the variational nature of our treatment of phonon degrees of freedom implies that only the lowest energy state is a valid result of our approach , even if the equations allow for more solutions .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 ( or more precisely the deviation from @xmath92 ) acts as a magnetic field in determining the existence of the two potential solution and which one is the ground state . for small ( large )",
    "@xmath62 only @xmath90(@xmath91 ) exists , and the energies of the two solutions cross in a first order line @xmath93 , ending in a critical point .",
    "to summarize , in the anti - adiabatic limit ( large  temperature \" ) regime , we have a single solution smoothly evolving with the  magnetic field \" @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath62 is large , lowering the `` temperature '' going from the anti - adiabatic to the adiabatic regime does not imply a dramatic change in the value of @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand for small @xmath62 @xmath1 changes from @xmath94 to @xmath95 moving from large to small @xmath59 .    the above ",

    "the weak - coupling solutions are characterized by a smooth renormalization of the correlation term that goes from its bare value in the adiabatic limit to the fully renormalized value @xmath106 as @xmath107 ; however the renormalized kinetic energy @xmath65 , dominated by the exponential term @xmath108 , is always @xmath109 .",
    "the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is not changed much as function of doping .",

    "the physics underlying the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is that by increasing @xmath62 a small number @xmath44 of localized holes strongly coupled to phonons have a lower energy ( @xmath110 , i.e. , the energy of @xmath44 polaronic holes ) than a bad metal that has a reduced kinetic energy , again of order @xmath44 ( @xmath111 ) due to the large effective mass ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "we now consider the fate of the two solutions @xmath90 and @xmath91 as we approach the mott transition by letting both @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in the adiabatic regime",
    "the mean field equations can be solved analytically and the polaronic solution only establishes at @xmath115 . at @xmath116",
    "this gives @xmath117 , which is reduced to 2 in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we can translate these values of the dimensionless coupling in terms of the dimensional phonon - mediated attraction at the zero - frequency , @xmath118 .",
    "we obtain @xmath119 close to the mott transition and @xmath120 in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we therefore find that , for @xmath0 close to @xmath121 , the weak - coupling solution @xmath90 is always the stable one even for quite large e - ph coupling up to @xmath122 , thus showing that the mott transition is robust with respect to e - ph interaction and polaron formation .",
    "@xcite through the stabilization of the @xmath90 solution the strong correlations close to the mott transition also protect the quasiparticles from a strong mass renormalization due to phonon effects@xcite .",
    "considering the fluctuations around the mean - field solution one recovers the high - energy hubbard bands@xcite .",
    "we expect that phonon effects will contribute significantly to them@xcite",
    ".    as it is well known , the mean - field treatment may be incorrect in reproducing the order of a phase transition , and in this sense the polaronic transition discussed above may be turned to a crossover when fluctuations are included , as it happens in dmft . on the other hand , the comparison with the dmft results shows that the mean - field description captures the basic qualitative features of how the polaron formation is affected by the presence of the e - e interaction .",
    "we gain further information on the way the system evolves when the mott insulator is approached by considering the compressibility @xmath123 , or equivalently the landau parameter @xmath124 , related to @xmath125 by the relation @xmath126 $ ] , where @xmath127 is the quasiparticle density of states per spin at the fermi level . to leading order in @xmath44",
    "we obtain @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the free dos ( per spin ) at the fermi level .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : landau ] ) represents the phononic contribution to the landau parameter dressed by the e - e interaction .",
    "the first term describes the electronic contribution to @xmath124 dressed by the e - ph correlation ; once more we find the same expression of the hubbard model with phonon - renormalized parameters @xcite .",
    "the attractive phononic contribution to @xmath124 increases the compressibility , and could eventually lead to a phase separation @xcite .",
    "this term is indeed only effective for the weak coupling @xmath90 solutions .",
    "however the compressibility of @xmath90 solutions diverges only for values of the parameters @xmath130 for which the @xmath91 solution is energetically favored .",
    "this finding is closely reminiscent of the dmft analysis of ref .",
    ", where the insulating behavior is favored by the e - ph interaction , but the divergence of the compressibility in the metal is prevented by the stabilization of the insulator . to verify the accuracy of our approach , we compare our compressibility ( [ eq : landau ] ) to the predictions of large - n expansion@xcite and dmft@xcite . to compare with ref . ,",
    "we take the large - u and small-@xmath59 limit ; then ( [ eq : landau ] ) acquires a simple random - phase approximation form @xmath131 $ ] , where @xmath132 is the density of states per spin in the large-@xmath0 limit in the absence of e - ph interaction and the phononic contribution to the symmetric landau amplitude is simply given by @xmath133 , in excellent agreement with . relaxing the large-@xmath0 limit",
    "we obtain @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the compressibility in the absence of the e - ph interaction and @xmath136 is a function of @xmath59 that approaches unity from below in the adiabatic limit .",

    "in the present paper we have discussed an analytical approach to the subject of e - ph interaction in strongly correlated systems , based on slave bosons , treated at the mean - field level , and a variational lang - firsov transformation .",
    "the mean - field description shows that the mott transition is robust with respect to e - ph interactions , yielding results in good quantitative agreement with previous dmft studies@xcite , and supplementing the dmft scenario with some analytical results that make the physical picture more transparent .",
    "furthermore we have shown that the nature of the evolution from weak to strong e - ph coupling is controlled by the adiabatic parameter @xmath59 . in the antiadiabatic regime ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath59 larger than a critical value @xmath81 , the evolution is a smooth crossover , which is replaced , below @xmath81 , by a first - order transition where the  rotation \" parameter @xmath1 jumps from a small ( @xmath138 , almost no rotation ) to a large value ( @xmath139 , fully developed polaronic regime ) .",
    "@xmath1 , despite being simply a variational parameter , measures the effectiveness of the e - ph coupling in affecting the electronic properties .    in the adiabatic regime",
    "the phonon - mediated attraction which screens the coulomb repulsion is found to be reduced proportionally to @xmath59 , in good agreement with dmft analyses . in this regime",
    "the phonon - induced effective mass enhancement is also reduced proportionally to the degree of adiabaticity .",
    "the first - order character of the transition from weak to strong coupling is most likely a spurious outcome of the mean - field theory .",
    "however the quantitative estimates of the boundaries between regions with different physical behavior are probably sound : at least they provide the correct order of magnitude in those cases where we have accurate estimates from alternative approaches . to what extent the present approach can give reliable results far from the strongly correlated regime",
