    "the gross  pitaevskii ( gp ) equation has a long history in the study of quantized vortices and solitons , and is important for both condensed matter and nonlinear physics . in superfluid @xmath0he and @xmath1he , vortices and solitons",
    "appear and numerous studies have been made of them @xcite .",
    "however , superfluid @xmath1he , which exhibits strong interactions between particles , can not be quantitatively described by the gp equation since it can be applied only to dilute bose systems .",
    "a dilute atomic bose ",
    "einstein condensate ( bec ) has been experimentally realized @xcite and is quantitatively described by the gp equation .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of vortices and solitons expected by the gp equation can be experimentally observed .",
    "thus , the experimental realization of dilute atomic becs sets the stage for the theoretical study of the gp equation .",
    "vortices in atomic becs have been experimentally and theoretically studied .",
    "the nucleation and dynamics of vortices are mainly treated in two systems .",
    "one is a system where the trapping potential rotates and in the other a localized potential moves in the atomic bec . in the former case",
    ", the vortices are nucleated from the surface of the condensate , and the vortex lattice is formed through the characteristic nonlinear dynamics@xcite . in the latter case",
    ", vortex pairs are nucleated by the uniform moving potential @xcite , giving rise to interesting dynamics .",
    "neely @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite experimentally and numerically observed that the vortices nucleated by the potential migrate with long periodicity in the condensate .",
    "the karman vortex street in atomic becs has been studied by numerical calculations based on the gp equation @xcite .",
    "solitons have also been investigated in atomic becs @xcite .",
    "solitons of the gp equation in a one - dimensional system are stable , while those in two or three - dimensional systems are unstable against long wavelength transverse oscillation , referred to as sneak instability@xcite .",
    "the instability of solitons leads to the nucleation of vortices , which has been experimentally and numerically confirmed @xcite .",
    "thus , solitons are profoundly related to vortices .",
    "the solitary wave solution of the gp equation has been investigated in detail by jones and roberts @xcite .",
    "they calculated the energy @xmath4 and the momentum @xmath5 of the solution , and found that there are two branches which are drawn from a common point in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane , the upper and lower branches , which denote the rarefaction pulse and the vortex pair , respectively @xcite .",
    "we expect that a vortex pair can dynamically change into a rarefaction pulse and vice versa .",
    "we have numerically observed that annihilation of a vortex pair creates a rarefaction pulse and the collapse of a pulse leads to the nucleation of a vortex pair , which is caused by an oscillating potential @xcite .",
    "a currently important theme in quantum hydrodynamics is quantum turbulence ( qt ) , which was first investigated in superfluid helium @xcite .",
    "there are a number of methods to create qt in this system .",
    "one is to employ thermal counterflow .",
    "another is to oscillate objects such as grids , micro spheres , wires , and forks in superfluid helium .",
    "recently , qt in an atomic bec has been vigorously studied @xcite .",
    "there are also several methods of creating qt in this system , namely phase printing @xcite , precessing a trapping potential @xcite , and oscillating the potential @xcite . to date ,",
    "experimental creation and observation of qt in atomic becs has been achieved only by oscillating a trapping potential @xcite .",
    "we apply a method for dealing with oscillating objects in superfluid helium to atomic becs .",
    "however , there is a definite difference between atomic becs and helium systems . in helium , moving objects do not nucleate vortices but simply amplify remanent vortices which already exist in the system , creating qt @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to theoretically treat the nucleation of vortices in helium due to the strong correlation between the atoms and it is not easy to control the event experimentally @xcite . in contrast , moving objects intrinsically nucleate vortices in experiments with atomic becs and optical techniques enable us to observe them @xcite .",
    "the nucleation of vortices and their dynamics are quantitatively described by the gp equation . in this system ,",
    "a blue detuned laser is used as the object , which is represented by a repulsive gaussian potential in our numerical calculation .",
    "we are interested in the nucleation and dynamics of vortices and solitons induced by oscillations of the potential , which should depend on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillating potential .",
    "previously , we have reported that the oscillating potential causes synergy dynamics of vortices and solitons peculiar to the oscillation , though the dependence on the parameters has not been investigated @xcite . in this paper , through the investigation of the dynamics induced by the oscillating potential , we study the dependence of the dynamics on the parameters and also the mechanism for the nucleation of vortices , the critical velocity of the nucleation , and the divergence of the nucleation time , which have not been satisfactorily treated for atomic becs .    previous research has been made on the response of atomic becs induced by an oscillating potential @xcite .",
    "however , the previous studies focused on dissipation and drag forces and barely considered the instability and nonlinear dynamics induced by an oscillating potential , including dynamical instability , landau instability , nucleation and dynamics of vortices and solitons , and quantum turbulence . therefore",
    ", our study is very different from previous studies .",
    "the nucleation of a vortex pair by an oscillating potential can be related to dynamical critical phenomena . in fact , nucleation by a linear moving potential has been investigated in terms of the phenomenon , and a power law between the vortex emission frequency and the velocity of the object near the critical velocity has been reported through a numerical simulation of the gp equation @xcite .",
    "thus , we address the nucleation by an oscillating potential in terms of dynamical critical phenomena . moreover , turbulence is deeply related to pattern formation @xcite , so that the dynamics induced by the oscillating potential is clearly connected with the process .",
    "these phenomena have been historically investigated by the complex ginzburg  landau equation , whose typical example is the gp equation .",
    "thus , it is possible to study nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena , namely pattern formation and dynamical critical phenomena , in atomic becs .",
    "therefore , our study can pioneer a new direction in atomic becs .",
    "the nucleation of vortices in quantum fluids has been considered to be an important issue , including the mechanism and critical velocity of the nucleation .",
    "previously , nucleation has been investigated in superfluid @xmath1he , where the core size of the vortices is so small that their visualization is hard .",
    "the theoretical study of nucleation is also difficult since the interaction between the @xmath1he atoms is very strong .",
    "however , in atomic becs , this situation changes .",
    "optical techniques make visualization possible and the dynamics of vortices can be followed in experiments .",
    "the nucleation and dynamics of vortices are easily treated because atomic becs are well described by the gp equation . in this paper , we focus on the mechanism and critical velocity of nucleation . the mechanism is discussed in terms of the divergence of the quantum pressure .",
    "our numerical calculations reveal that the coherence length and size of the potential are very relevant to the critical velocity of the nucleation , and we propose an expression of the velocity including both lengths .",
    "we consider an atomic bec confined by a harmonic trap to investigate the dynamics of the condensate induced by a repulsive oscillating gaussian potential .",

    "we summarize our study in sec .",
    "we consider an atomic bec near zero temperature , in which the interaction between particles is very weak because of the low density and is replaced by an effective interaction proportional to the delta function and the s - wave scattering length .",
    "almost all particles are condensed near zero temperature so that this system is well described by a macroscopic wavefunction @xmath8 obeying the gp equation . in this work",
    ", we assume that the condensate is strongly confined along the @xmath9 direction , that is , a quasi two - dimensional system .",
    "therefore it is well described by the two - dimensional gp equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the particle mass , @xmath12 is the potential , and @xmath13 is an interaction parameter for the two - dimensional case , where the wavefunction along the @xmath9 direction is assumed to be gaussian @xcite .",

    "this is the ground state before the potential starts to move , obtained by the imaginary time step method .",
    "the size of the potential @xmath40 is defined as the rounded value of the diameter of the boundary of the low density region , which is lower than half of the bulk density . in our case , @xmath41 .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows that the potential of size @xmath40 is surrounded with a boundary layer , which is a low density region with a width of the order @xmath42 .",
    "this boundary layer plays a key role for any dynamics of vortices near the potential , as discussed later .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical calculation is confirmed by the two following methods .",
    "one is the mirror symmetry about the @xmath21 axis , which must be maintained because the initial state has mirror symmetry and the potential oscillates in the @xmath21-direction to maintain the symmetry .",
    "the other is to check that the final state of the condensate , which is obtained by the numerical calculation with forward time evolution , returns properly to the initial state in fig . 1 when we perform the calculation with backward time evolution from the final state .",
    "this is confirmed by the total energy and the momentum in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "vortices can be nucleated in our system because of the breakdown of kelvin s theorem on circulation .",
    "this theorem is established in classical fluid dynamics described by the euler equation and ensures the conservation of vorticity , which leads to neither nucleation nor the disappearance of vortices .",

    "3 . in the other sub - region solitons",
    "are nucleated near the potential , as shown in fig .",
    "figure 13(a ) shows that the region for reconnection of vortices near the potential ( @xmath107 ) is wider than that for nucleation of solitons near the potential ( @xmath108 ) if the amplitude @xmath113 is larger than @xmath40 .",

    "the distance between the vortices and the potential is essential for the dynamics ( @xmath108 ) as explained in sec .",
    "v. when the amplitude and frequency of the potential is slightly larger than the critical values for nucleation of vortices , the distance is small .",

    "vi is induced by the potential .",
    "it is not the case that the dynamics induced by an oscillating potential approximate those of a uniformly moving potential if the frequency @xmath88 approaches zero .",
    "this is because , even though the potential oscillates with low frequency , it nucleates vortex pairs with different charges , and the reconnection of vortices or the nucleation of solitons near the potential not caused by the uniformly moving potential can occur .",
    "therefore , the dynamics under an oscillating potential is qualitatively different from that with a uniformly moving potential .",
    "the mechanism of nucleation of quantized vortices is one of the most important issues for quantum fluids .",
    "this is because the vortices , which are stable topological defects , bring remarkable changes to the system once they are nucleated .",
    "for example , the decay of the permanent flow of superfluid helium is considered to be strongly related to the motion of vortices , which leads to phase slippage .",
    "our numerical calculations suggest that the mechanism of nucleation of vortices in a system with an oscillating potential is different from that in a system where the condensate flows uniformly without any obstacles .",
    "nucleation in a uniform system requires excitation of phonons since a low density region causing divergence of the quantum pressure can be formed only by the growth of the amplitude of phonons , which leads to the breakdown of kelvin s theorem on circulation , as explained in sec .",
    "iii .    however , in a system with an oscillating potential , a different mechanism of nucleation applies . in this system",
    ", the potential creates a low density region inside itself , causing divergence of the quantum pressure .",
    "this leads to nucleation without any growth of phonons , as shown in fig . 2 where a ghost vortex pair is nucleated inside the potential and moves away from it to become a usual vortex pair .",
    "according to the numerical calculations , an oscillating potential continues nucleating phonons in the condensate , though the phonons do not grow to create a low density region causing the divergence when the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation is near the critical value for nucleation of vortices . if the parameters of the oscillation are much larger than the critical values , the phonons nucleated by the potential may form a low density region .",
    "therefore , our numerical calculations show that the critical velocity for nucleation of vortices by a potential is smaller than that by the growth of phonons in our system .",
    "we now consider the nucleation of a single vortex pair in fig .",
    "2 , rather than multiple vortex pairs in fig . 12 , and define the nucleation induced by the oscillating potential .",
    "our definition of nucleation is based on the increase of the total energy of the system and the density profile as shown in the following .",
    "the total energy increases by the energy of the vortices when the potential nucleates vortices , which is roughly estimated to be the order of @xmath118 @xmath119 in our simulation by using the energy of a vortex in a uniform system @xcite expressed by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the size of the system , which is the thomas  fermi radius @xmath39 in our case .",

    "then , neither reconnection in fig .",
    "3 nor nucleation of solitons in fig . 9 occur .",
    "thus , vortices appear and disappear within the boundary layer of the potential .",
    "we judge that the vortices are not yet nucleated by the potential in this case . on the other hand , the behavior of the total energy in fig .",
    "14 changes markedly during @xmath124@xmath125 @xmath126 when the vortices are nucleated by the oscillating potential .",
    "figure 14 ( c ) shows the density profile for the nucleation of vortices , which shows that vortices sufficiently escape from the boundary layer of the potential .",
    "an increase of the order of @xmath118 @xmath119 occurs twice within a period of the oscillation @xmath127 because of the following .",
    "the potential moves in the @xmath21 direction and nucleates a vortex pair during the former half period @xmath128 .",
    "then , it starts to move back in the @xmath129 direction and nucleates another pair which has an impulse opposite to that of the previous pair during the latter half period @xmath128 .",

    "our simulation shows that the vortices can be nucleated without the growth of phonons , which means that the velocity @xmath139 is not directly related to the nucleation of vortices , being just the critical velocity for which bogoliubov phonons are excited in a uniform system .",

    "the energy for the no vortex situation ( @xmath190 /s and @xmath178 /s ) slightly increases due to nucleation of phonons .",
    "however , in the case of nucleation of vortices ( @xmath179 /s and @xmath181 /s ) , the energy greatly increases .",
    "thus , there is a clear difference between the two cases , as reported by jackson @xmath2 @xmath3 . @xcite .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations with the gp equation under the condition that the aspect ratio of the shape of the condensate is fixed .",
    "one may be concerned about the dependence of the aspect ratio on the dynamics .",
    "however , we believe that the dependence is weak . the dynamics induced by an oscillating potential can be classified into two kinds .",
    "one is the dynamics near the potential , which includes the reconnection of vortices and nucleation of solitons near the potential .",
    "these dynamics are barely concerned with the surface , occurring with an arbitrary aspect ratio .",
    "the other is the dynamics of vortices and solitons related to the surface of the condensate , including the migration of vortices in fig .",
    "8 and the collision and collapse of solitons in fig . 7 .",
    "the migration is considered to have a weak dependence because the vortices only move along the surface .",
    "on the other hand , the collision and collapse can have a dependence on the aspect ratio .",
    "the direction of motion of the solitons depends on the curvature of the surface , so that the collision and collapse may not occur .",
    "our numerical calculations do not contain noise in the initial state , so that all our results have mirror symmetry about the @xmath21 axis . however , our results should be consistent with experiments with noise and fluctuation breaking the symmetry of the system .",
    "our results for the dynamics of vortices and solitons are dominated by their behavior near the potential , such as the reconnection of vortices and nucleation of solitons near the potential .",
    "these dynamics are local , so that the noise do not influence them .",
    "though the noise would break the mirror symmetry of the condensate , the overall dynamics would not be qualitatively affected .",
    "the results in this paper are based on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) gp equation , from which we can infer the dynamics of vortices and solitons for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case .",
    "a vortex pair and soliton with linear configuration in 2d correspond to a vortex ring and a soliton with planar configuration in the 3d case .",
    "thus , the dynamics in 3d would be obtained by replacing the vortex pair and linear soliton with a vortex ring and planar soliton .",
    "an oscillating potential in 3d can create a vortex tangle in the condensate and lead to qt .    finally , we consider the appropriate parameters for an oscillating potential for the growth of qt .",
    "qt needs vortices and hence the regions ii and iii in fig .",
    "13 would be appropriate .",
    "however , region ii with nucleation of solitons near the potential will not develop to qt as the number of the nucleated vortices is insufficient .",
    "therefore , we suggest region ii with a large amplitude compared with the size of the potential and region iii as appropriate parameters for the growth of qt .",
    "an oscillating potential with the parameters in regions ii and iii may lead to granulation of the condensate .",
    "in fact , the sign appears in fig .",
    "12 ( d ) , where the boundary of the condensate is granular .",
    "we numerically calculated the two dimensional gp equation to investigate the dependence of the parameters on the dynamics of the condensate induced by an oscillating potential .",
    "we roughly obtained four kinds of dynamics .",
    "first , the oscillating potential does not nucleate vortices and solitons ; only the emission of phonons occurs .",
    "second , the potential nucleates vortices and reconnection of vortices near the potential in fig . 3 occurs .",
    "thereafter , the vortices migrate in the condensate or transform into the solitons as shown in sec .",
    "thirdly , the potential nucleates solitons near itself in fig . 9 , which is very different from the case in sec .",
    "after nucleation , the solitons transform into vortex pairs or transfer to the surface of the condensate as shown in sec .",
    "v. fourthly , multiple vortex pairs are nucleated by the potential , which forms the distorted condensate in fig .",
    "these dynamics depend on the parameters of the oscillating potential , which is represented by the phase diagram in fig .",
    "we minutely discuss the nucleation of vortices induced by an oscillating potential .",
    "the key to the nucleation is the divergence of the quantum pressure , which leads to the breakdown of kelvin s theorem on circulation .",
    "thus , nucleation requires a low density region to cause the divergence , from which it follows that the mechanism of the nucleation has two processes .",
    "one is the process in which the vortices are nucleated through the growth of the amplitude of phonons .",
    "the other is that the low density region inside the potential causing the divergence leads to nucleation of vortices without the growth of phonons .",
    "we propose a new expression of eq .",
    "( 9 ) for the critical velocity @xmath140 of the nucleation , including both the coherence length @xmath42 and the size @xmath40 of the potential .",
    "we treated the nucleation of vortices by an oscillating potential as a problem of dynamical critical phenomena , and investigated the relation between the nucleation time and the frequency .",
    "our numerical calculation revealed that the nucleation time diverges near the critical frequency , but we unfortunately could not confirm the power law between the time and the frequency .",
