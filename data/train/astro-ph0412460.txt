    "superclusters are the largest systems of galaxies , composed of multiple clusters of galaxies , extending over 10 - 20  mpc ( e.g. , bahcall , soneira 1984 ; postman , geller , huchra 1988 ; quintana et al",
    ".  1995 ; small et al .  1998 ) .",
    "according to the n - body simulations which successfully reproduce the observed filamentary structures at the local universe ( e.g. , peacock et al .",
    "2001 ) , clusters of galaxies at @xmath10 are still in the process of formation ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "therefore , clusters of galaxies at this cosmological distance , especially superclusters , are important sites where we can directly see the process of structure formation and evolution and mass assembly to cluster cores .    despite the importance in the cosmological context",
    ", however , only a few superclusters with the scale of @xmath910  mpc have been identified so far at high redshifts , especially beyond @xmath10 ( connolly et al .",
    "1996 ; lubin et al .",
    "2000 ; tanaka et al .",
    "the limitation comes largely from the small field of view of large telescopes .    the advent of the suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) , a huge format optical camera with a 30@xmath2 field of view on the prime focus of the 8.2 m subaru telescope , has made it possible for us to view a @xmath910  mpc region all at once at high redshifts .",
    "kodama et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have taken this unique advantage of the suprime - cam on subaru to map out the large scale structure around the a851 cluster at @xmath11 .",
    "they have found many filamentary structures and subclumps spreading over 5  mpc from the dense cluster core , on the basis of photometric redshift ( photo - z ) analysis , an approach similar to that taken in this _",
    "letter_.    by utilizing the great light - collection power of the subaru telescope , we now target the most distant supercluster ever firmly identified with spectroscopy : ie . , the lynx supercluster region at @xmath5 composed of two known clusters , rxj  0848.9 + 4452 at @xmath0 and rxj  0848.6 + 4453 at @xmath1 , which are spectroscopically confirmed x - ray emitting clusters firstly reported by rosati et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and stanford et al .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosities of rxj  0848.9 and rxj  0848.6 are @xmath12  ergs  s@xmath13 and @xmath14  ergs  s@xmath13 , respectively , which are derived with the chandra observation ( stanford et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "throughout this paper , we use the ab magnitude system ( oke , gunn 1983 ) . the adopted cosmological parameters are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which gives a physical scale of 8.37@xmath17  kpc  arcsec@xmath13 at the cluster redshift .",
    ".log of the observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath18 @xmath19 aperture + @xmath20 quoted from stanford et al .",
    "( 2001 ) + @xmath21 the tabulated numbers for gr1 may be significantly affected by the contamination of the blue galaxies in the @xmath22  ( arcmin ) region , and hence + unreliable .",
    "+ @xmath23 the flux ( corrected for the galactic absorption ) and luminosity are given in the rest - frame 0.52 kev band .",
    "they are converted from the 0.52 kev + count rate in the observed frame by assuming an optically - thin thermal plasma model at @xmath1 with a temperature of 6 kev and elemental + abundances of 0.3 solar .",
    "+ @xmath24 3@xmath7 upper limits    table  [ table2 ] summarizes the properties of the known clusters and the cluster / group candidates .",
    "the j2000.0 coordinates of the each cluster / group candidate are given in columns 2 and 3 .",
    "columns 4 and 5 show the surface number density of all the galaxies and the red galaxies only , respectively , within a circle of @xmath25  mpc radius .",
    "we also only use galaxies at @xmath26 .",
    "the remaining field contamination has been subtracted using the sdf data ( see above ) , and the errors indicate the poisson statistics based on the number of cluster galaxies and that of the subtracted field galaxies . in column 6 , we show the estimated richness of each cluster / group candidate , using the @xmath27 indicator introduced by hill & lilly ( 1991 ) .",
    "this indicates the number of galaxies within a 0.5  mpc radius from the cluster center and within the magnitude range between @xmath28 and @xmath29 measured in the @xmath30 band at @xmath31 .",
    "since the @xmath30 band at @xmath31 roughly corresponds to the @xmath32-band at @xmath5 , we can make a direct comparison with their measurements .",
    "the cluster richness estimated based on @xmath27 is 1 - 2 for cl1 and cl2 , while 0 - 1 for gr1-gr7 ( see table  4 of hill & lilly 1991 ) .",
    "therefore we find that the candidates we newly find are poorer systems than the two known clusters .",
    "this is also suggested from deep x - ray data around the lynx field taken with chandra ( stanford et al .",
    "2001 ; stern et al .",
    "2002 ) . using the chandra image in the 0.52 kev band",
    ", we measure the flux of excess diffuse emission in the circular region around each candidate with a radius of 35@xmath33 .",
    "the background ( the unresolved x - ray background and non x - ray background ) is estimated from a surrounding annular region .",
    "the result is shown in column  8 of table  [ table2 ] .",
    "note that gr6 and gr7 are outside of the chandra field .",
    "we can not detect any significant x - ray excess at more than the @xmath34 level for our cluster / group candidates except for the two known clusters .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the @xmath34 upper limit luminosity of each region ( see column  9 of table  [ table2 ] ) is comparable to a typical luminosity of nearby groups of galaxies .",
    "thus , the non - detection in the chandra data does not necessarily imply that the regions we find have unusually low x - ray luminosities compared with their optical richnesses .",
    "we argue therefore that our ` suprime - cam imaging + photo - z ' method is a very powerful technique in finding clusters or groups in the distant universe even beyond @xmath35 out to @xmath36 .",
    "we note that this is practically the highest redshift structures of ` normal ' galaxies that can be traced by optical images with our scheme ( bracketing the 4000 - break region in the rest frame ) .",
    "we have presented the results of deep panoramic imaging of the lynx supercluster field at @xmath5 taken with the suprime - cam on subaru telescope .",
    "our multicolour image covers an area of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 mpc ) , allowing us for the first time to investigate large scale structure spreading around the known cluster regions at this high redshift . by applying the photometric - redshift technique ,",
    "we have mapped out the spatial distribution of galaxies near the redshift of the supercluster down to @xmath8 .",
    "we have newly discovered seven cluster / group candidates .",
    "these candidates show red colour - magnitude sequences and centrally concentrated profiles , similar to those of the two known clusters in this field , indicating that they are likely to be real clusters / groups of galaxies around the lynx supercluster , comprising a large - scale structure over @xmath3913  @xmath17mpc scales .",
    "the clumpiness of the candidates suggests that they are in early dynamical stages , being in the process of assembly to a massive cluster",
    ".    the next key step will be to confirm with deep spectroscopic observations that the cluster / group candidates we discovered in this study are physically associated with one another and forming a real large - scale structure at @xmath40 .",
    "if confirmed , this will be the highest redshift structure of ` normal ' galaxies ever identified , which will have a large impact on structure formation theories and will bring us invaluable information on the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies at their early stages .",
