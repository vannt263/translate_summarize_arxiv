    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in discrete time consists of particles on @xmath3 with at most one particle at each site ( exclusion principle ) . at each time step",
    ", particles jump to the neighboring right site with probability @xmath4 , provided the target site is empty .",
    "there are mainly two types of update rules one can consider .",
    "one is called _",
    "parallel update_. it consists in first checking for all particles if they can jump ( i.e. , if their right neighbor is empty ) and then , simultaneously and independently , these particles jump to the right each with probability @xmath5 . the second update rule , the one we actually analyze in this paper , is called _ sequential update_. in this case , at each time step particles are processed sequentially from right to left , i.e. , starting from right to left , if the site on the right of a particle is empty , then this particle jumps there with probability @xmath5 .",
    "this update rule allows to shift blocks of particles to the right during one time - step .",
    "equivalently , it can be regarded as a parallel update rule for holes , which under the constraint of keeping their order , jump to the left @xmath6 steps with probability proportional to @xmath7 .    on a macroscopic level",
    "the particle density , @xmath8 , evolves deterministically according to the burgers equation @xmath9 .",
    "it is therefore natural to focus on fluctuations , which turn out to have unexpected features .",
    "for example , the fluctuations of particle positions live on a @xmath10 scale and the limiting distribution depends on the type of the initial configuration .    in this paper",
    "we consider the positions of particles as observables .",
    "if one starts with step initial conditions , i.e. , particles occupying @xmath11 , then the macroscopic particle density has a region of linear decay  @xcite .",
    "there the fluctuations are governed by the gue tracy - widom distribution  @xcite , see  @xcite . moreover , in the limit of large time @xmath12 , the joint distributions of particle positions are governed by the airy process  @xcite ( called airy@xmath13 process in the following ) . the second situation which has been analyzed is the stationary initial condition  @xcite .",
    "these results have been obtained for the continuous time and/or parallel update discrete time tasep , but can be easily extended to the sequencial update case .    a third class of initial conditions consists in deterministic and periodic initial configurations .",
    "in  @xcite and  @xcite the continuous time tasep has been studied for the particular case of alternating initial configuration , i.e. , initially with particles on @xmath14 . in this case the one - particle fluctuations are described by the goe tracy - widom distribution .",
    "joint distributions are given by a fredholm determinant and the kernel converges pointwise to the one of the airy@xmath2 process . in the present paper",
    "we extend these results in several directions .",
    "firstly , we look at the fully discretized version of the tasep with sequencial update .",
    "secondly , our result holds for a wider set of periodic initial configurations and , thirdly , the control on the kernel is stronger and we prove convergence of joint distribution functions . the corresponding results for continuous time can be obtained along the same lines .    the airy@xmath2 process , @xmath15 , is a marginal of the signed determinantal point process with extended kernel @xmath16 , in the same way as the airy@xmath13 process is related to the extended airy kernel .",
    "explicitly , we set @xmath17 and let @xmath18 denote the one - dimensional laplacian .",
    "then @xmath19 more explicitly , as shown in appendix a of  @xcite , one has @xmath20 in particular , the one - point distribution of the airy@xmath2 process is given in terms of the goe tracy - widom distribution  @xcite , as shown in  @xcite , @xmath21    the process @xmath15 was first described by sasamoto  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is a determinantal formula for the probability distribution of the continuous time tasep with finitely many particles , first discovered by schtz  @xcite .",
    "sasamoto found a clever reformulation making possible the large time asymptotic analysis for the positions of particles .",
    "the details of the derivation are presented in  @xcite .",
    "there we show how the signed determinantal point process arises by applying a result on the l - ensembles defined in  @xcite .    for the discrete - time sequential update tasep , a determinantal formula of the same type as in  @xcite was derived in  @xcite via the bethe ansatz .",
    "since this is the starting point of our analysis we present here an elementary derivation .",
    "very recently , a determinantal formula for parallel update was obtained  @xcite . whether or not in this case a similar approach can be used for asymptotic analysis has still to be investigated .    by universality",
    ", one expects that the same limit process appears for any deterministic and periodic initial configurations , not only for particles initially on @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we consider initial conditions with one particle every @xmath22 sites .",
    "the fluctuations of the position of a particle live on the scale @xmath10 , while the positions of two particles are non - trivially correlated ( on the @xmath10 scale ) if they are of order @xmath23 apart . in theorem  [ thmconvtosasproc ]",
    "we prove that , properly rescaled , the joint distributions of particle positions converge to the joint distributions of the airy@xmath2 process .",
    "that is , let @xmath24 be the position at time @xmath12 of the particles starting at @xmath25 , then for some constants @xmath26 depending only on @xmath5 and @xmath22 , one has @xmath27}(t)-\\mu u t^{2/3}}{\\sigma",

    "given a realization of the particle process , one defines for each time @xmath12 a continuous height function , @xmath28 , as follows .",
    "the height at @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of particles which jumped from site @xmath29 to site @xmath32 during the time interval @xmath33 .",

    "there is only one simple case , @xmath49 , which is equivalent to flat and horizontal initial conditions . in this case , there is only one pole and the asymptotic analysis reduces to the one of a single integral on the complex plane .",
    "an explicit solution of the polynomial equation does not exist for arbitrary @xmath47 , thus we had to employ several new ideas to circumvent the problem .",
    "similar situations might appear in other problems like point - to - line directed percolation and all sorts of growth models on a flat substrate .",
