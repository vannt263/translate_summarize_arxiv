    "multicomponent fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems feature rich physics of strongly interacting electrons .",
    "in contrast to strong electronic correlations in various ( material dependent ) crystal settings , in fqh systems the kinetic energy is effectively removed from the problem due to the landau quantization in strong magnetic fields .",
    "this makes the multicomponent fqh systems a simpler ( better controlled ) setting that is amenable to the investigations of fundamental physics of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "one of the most prominent examples of multicomponent fqh systems is the quantum hall bilayer ( qhb ) at total filling factor one .",
    "the filling factor @xmath1 is defined as a product of electron density @xmath2 and the magnetic area @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the emergent length scale in the magnetic field (  magnetic length \" )  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the filling factor represents the ratio of the number of electrons @xmath5 to the number of magnetic flux quanta @xmath6 through the system . in the case of the @xmath7 qhb",
    "studied here , there are two quantum wells (  layers \" ) that we label by @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "note that throughout this work we assume the ordinary electron spin to be fully polarized by the external magnetic field .",
    "because of the two - fold layer degree of freedom , in general we need to distinguish the interaction between electrons in the same layer (  intra - layer \" ) versus electrons in opposite layers (  inter - layer \" )",
    ". the difference between these two interaction strengths can be tuned experimentally via the parameter called the bilayer distance @xmath10 , which makes the physics in this system much richer compared to an ordinary system of electrons with spin .",
    "qhb system has indeed attracted much attention since the time of the theoretical prediction  @xcite and experimental detection  @xcite of the ordered state of excitons ( bosons ) that forms when @xmath11 , despite the fact that the fundamental charge carriers in the system are fermions .",
    "perhaps equally remarkable and interesting is the physics at larger ( intermediate ) distances , typically @xmath12 .",
    "there , an intermediate phase of paired composite fermions , introduced in ref .",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ fpairing1 ] ) and ( [ sdispairing ] ) below ] , is believed to exist . on the other hand ,",
    "an exact diagonalization study of the system in the torus geometry @xcite also pointed out to the existence of pseudospin state(s ) with spiraling order in the intermediate region . here",
    "we reconcile these two descriptions of the intermediate region by considering the underlying bosonic representation of the composite fermion paired state in the long distance limit , and by performing extensive exact diagonalization studies on the torus .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : review ] we start with an overview of the qhb physics from the point of view of model wave functions .",
    "we first discuss the limits of small and large bilayer distances which are well - understood and correspond to the exciton superfluid and the product of two decoupled ( composite ) fermi liquid states , respectively .",
    "we also review the theoretical evidence for a paired phase in the regime of intermediate bilayer distances , and briefly motivate and summarize our contributions . in section [ sec : picture ] we provide a simple physical picture for the formation of the putative intermediate state .",
    "section [ sec : numerics ] contains results of exact diagonalization studies of the qhb on the torus . in section [ sec : boson ] we discuss the torus results from the composite boson viewpoint , and give arguments for meron deconfinement in the intermediate region .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] with a short summary and discussion .",
    "appendices contain further resullts on the intermediate phase .",
    "the qhb at the total filling factor one consists of two quantum hall mono - layers separated by distance @xmath10 in the @xmath13-direction ( perpendicular to both layers ) .",
    "the tunneling between the layers can be nearly completely suppressed in experiment .",
    "therefore , we can assume that @xmath14 and each layer is at filling one half .",
    "in the following we first give the basic physical picture of the ground state in the limit of either small ( @xmath15 ) or large distances @xmath16 , followed by the discussion of the intermediate regime @xmath17 .      for small distances ,",
    "the intra- and inter - layer interactions are of similar strength , and favor each electron in one layer to be directly on top of a hole in the other layer , which drives exciton formation . in this simplified picture",
    "we can differentiate between up and down excitons , but due to the quantum - mechanical uncertainty in which layer an electron is , we must include the pseudospin ( layer ) degree of freedom .",
    "the appropriate model function at total filling factor one then reads  @xcite @xmath18 the spatial part of the wave function is written in terms of 2d electron coodinates @xmath19 ( regardless of the layer index ) , and assumes the circular gauge for the magnetic field in the infinite plane .",
    "the spatial correlations are encoded via the laughlin - jastrow factor @xmath20 , and the wave function vanishes at large distances because of the gaussian term that originates from the single - electron orbitals  @xcite .",
    "note that the wave function also contains the pseudospin part @xmath21 .",
    "the pseudospin of each electron points to the same direction , due to the combined effect of the pauli principle and the coulomb interaction .",
    "the state of each particle @xmath22 is given by the pseudospin @xmath23 i.e. , the pseudospin is polarized in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "this happens because of the capacitor effect which enforces the equality of total charges in the  up \" and  down \" layer , and breaks the @xmath25 spin symmetry , assumed to exist at @xmath26 , down to @xmath27 .",
    "this correlation - condensation was detected in several experiments , e.g. , spielman _",
    "@xcite , although the  zero - bias peak \" anomaly was never as high and sharp as in the similar experiments on superconductors .",
    "more recent experiments using coulomb drag and counterflow measurements are also completely in favor of exciton formation [ for a recent review , see ref . ] .      when the layers are far apart , it is well - known that each half - filled layer is in the state of the  fermi - liquid - like \" state @xcite .",
    "for example , the state of the upper layer is given by @xmath28 where we dropped the single - particle gaussian factors .",
    "the fermi liquid correlations result from the factor @xmath29 that represents the slater determinant of plane waves . here , @xmath30 is the set of 2d momenta that define the 2d fermi sphere and we have substituted @xmath31 .",
    "the total wave function of the system in this case is just a direct product of independent layers , @xmath32    notice that both @xmath33 and @xmath34 contain a part which is the product of the differences of @xmath13 s ( the laughlin - jastrow part ) .",
    "this part of the wave function fixes the filling factor of the state , which can be seen as follows . on the one hand ,",
    "the highest exponent in any of the @xmath13 s is equal to the number of flux quanta through the system , which is the degeneracy of the lowest landau level ( lll ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this number is equal to the number of electrons in the case of @xmath33 , and twice larger than the number of electrons in the case of @xmath34 , as follows from the filling factors .",
    "thus , formally speaking the laughlin - jastrow part is the  charge \" part of the wave function , while the rest is the ",
    "neutral \" part . in @xmath33",
    "the neutral part is the condensate of pseudospins . in @xmath34",
    "the neutral part contains the slater determinant which introduces the complex conjugate coordinates @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath34 in general has a non - zero projection on many landau levels and not just the lll .",
    "if @xmath34 is to be used a lll trial wave function , in general it must be explicitly projected via a complicated derivative operator @xmath36 to make it a function of @xmath13 s only  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the long distance regime with the sample length @xmath37 , we may assume that @xmath13 and @xmath35 s commute , and thus in this regime the form of the wave function formally decouples into charge and neutral parts .",
    "given that the qhb ground state in the limits of both small and large @xmath10 is in a liquid phase , it seems unlikely that a possible intermediate state is a charge - density wave ( that breaks the translation symmetry ) .    a possible way to describe",
    "this evolution is to start from the bose condensate which is smoothly modified by two fermi condensates that grow as the distance @xmath10 increases @xcite . in such a study on the sphere @xcite it was found that the two fermi condensates pair in the manner of weakly paired bcs @xmath38 wave cooper pairs .",
    "( we use the phrase  weakly paired \" to denote cooper pairs that are not exponentially localized . )",
    "thus , at the end of the evolution of the superfluid state one may expect the following wave function ,  @xcite @xmath39 to describe the system .",
    "we use here and below a shortened form of the wave functions with spin , where spatial coordinates carry spin .",
    "it is understood that by combining the spatial wave functions with spinor wave functions , and summing with proper sign factors over all ways of choosing which electrons have which spin , we get proper totally antisymmetric wave functions . in eq .",
    "( [ fpairing1 ] ) ",
    "@xmath40 \" denotes the antisymmetrized product of @xmath41 pairs of cooper pair wave functions , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the cooper pair wave function @xmath45 describes @xmath38 pairing , i.e. , at small distances it behaves as  @xcite @xmath46 with @xmath47 , and @xmath48 which fixes the relative angular momentum of the cooper pair .",
    "based on the study of ref .",
    ", other numerical studies ( summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : picture ] ) , and our results ( sec . [",
    "sec : numerics ] ) , we will adopt the view that an intermediate state does exist and can be modeled as a bcs @xmath0-wave paired state of composite fermions .",
    "the question of whether in the thermodynamic limit we obtain a critical region ( phase ) or rather a critical point is more subtle because of the limitations of all the existing numerics to small system sizes .",
    "therefore , we will use the term  intermediate phase \" loosely , keeping in mind the possibility of it becoming a critical point in the limit of a very large ( clean ) system .    in the remaining part of this section",
    ", we will introduce in a formal way a possible alternative description of the intermediate state based on the picture of composite bosons , which we expect to be relevant in the long distance limit .",
    "first , we would like to point out that the most natural long - distance weak pairing behavior of the pair function in eq .",
    "( [ fpairing1 ] ) with @xmath48 would be @xmath49 this coincides with the existence of a bcs description with a gap function @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 is an eigenfunction of rotations in 2d with @xmath48 [ see ref . ] .",
    "this generic behavior may be used to define a suitable candidate for a projected @xmath0-wave paired composite fermion wave function valid at all distances in the lll , @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the necessary projection to the lll ( see appendix [ app : proj ] for the details of the projection ) . here",
    "we confine ourselves to the long - distance regime , i.e. , consider eq.([fpairing1 ] ) with ( [ pbehavior ] ) .",
    "in this regime , the particles may be considered point - like as the relevant probing wavelengths are much larger than @xmath54 .",
    "thus , to obtain the long - distance properties we use eq .",
    "( [ fpairing1 ] ) with ( [ pbehavior ] ) , instead of the proper lll function [ eq . ( [ pfpairing ] ) ] , assuming as usual that the universal ( topological ) properties are insensitive to the microscopic differences between the two wave functions . in the following , we will explain how in this regime of the @xmath0-wave composite fermon pairing we can also consider a composite boson representation , which will enable us to describe the topological features ( degenerate ground states on the torus and quasiparticle content ) of the intermediate state .",
    "thus the model wave function for the state into which the superfluid evolves , in the long - distance limit when @xmath13 and @xmath35 commute , is @xmath55 using the cauchy identity , we can rewrite the wave function in the following form @xmath56 again , at long distances the charge and neutral part formally decouple , and the neutral part can be viewed as a wave function of some underlying composite boson quasiparticles .",
    "furthermore , the neutral part is the product of two determinants , and a careful conformal field theory ( cft ) analysis @xcite will allow for an existence of a branch of gapless excitations ( see appendix a ) on top of this non - chiral state .",
    "these formal arguments also suggest that there is a possibility to interpret the intermediate phase in the qhb in terms of bosonic quasiparticles that correlate in a special way via eq .",
    "( [ twodet ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ twodet ] ) ( see also appendix a ) we can read off that the one - particle exciton ( or composite boson ) correlation function is @xmath57 therefore , instead of the long - range order that we had in eq .",
    "( [ ferro ] ) , in this ground state we have quasi long - range order . indeed , in the finite - size study performed in ref .",
    ", it was noticed that the excitonic superfluid order parameter , i.e. @xmath58 , persists in the state with no correlated bosonic quasiparticles in the manner of eq .",
    "( [ ferro ] ) ( i.e. , the so - called  111 \" state  @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that these critical bosons [ eq .",
    "( [ twodet ] ) ] may exist in a region between a ferromagnetically ordered and a completely disordered phase , and thus we may expect a gapless mode and compressible behavior in the neutral sector .",
    "this is supported by exact diagonalization studies on the sphere @xcite , but also by the detection of ordered ( correlated ) behavior in early experiments @xcite , which were performed at distances where we expect the physics of the intermediate state to be relevant .",
    "but what makes the intermediate region so attractive , as we will show in greater detail by exact diagonalization studies on torus [ sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] ] , is the existence of competing ground states at momenta that diverge in the thermodynamic limit , and thus define different sectors of the system .",
    "this signals a topological structure that coexists with gapless behavior . a convenient way of describing various sectors , as we will argue , is to take the composite boson view of the ground state pairing correlations .",
    "then bose condensates under different boundary conditions @xcite can be identified with the competing ground states from exact diagonalization studies on the torus .    as usual in topological systems ,",
    "the torus ground states can be connected with quasiparticles of the topological phase under consideration .",
    "we expect this also to be valid in our gapless system , and by bose condensing in two different pseudospin states , we will be able to connect different ground states with meron spin - textures .",
    "this opens a door for a possibility that merons ",
    "fractionally charged vortices of the @xmath24 ordered state @xcite  exist as free ( deconfined or not bound in pairs ) quasiparticles in the intermediate state .",
    "the first exact diagonalization study on the torus that pointed out to the existence of the competing ground states with momenta that diverge in the thermodynamic limit was done by park @xcite ( see appendix [ app : park ] for a brief review of the relationship between ref . and our work ) . in ref .",
    "a spiraling structure in the competing ground states was identified , and it was argued that the intermediate phase possesses a pseudospin spiral order .",
    "therefore , the competing states were interpreted as new developing ground states that replace the @xmath24 ordered state ( valid for smaller distances ) due to a ( classical ) symmetry - breaking ordering .",
    "on the other hand , in this work we give numerical and analytical reasons to consider an intermediate state with richer topological content than the @xmath24 ordered state ( which has a simple integer quantum hall effect characterization ) . in the intermediate phase , due to _ topological _ order ,",
    "new quasiparticles emerge and define additional ground states on the torus which have a spiraling structure . in this way",
    "our work suggests a way to reconcile and unify the views of the intermediate phase based on the previous numerical approaches , especially ref . and ref .",
    "one may naively estimate that the transition to a disordered phase occurs around @xmath59 , and this estimate is in agrement with several results in the literature that we summarize here .",
    "( i ) the calculated treshold for the disappearance of the long - range correlated composite bosons and the extrapolated estimate for the vanishing of the long - range order parameter in ref .  .",
    "( ii ) the change in the dmrg spectrum computed in ref .  , i.e. , a  change in the nature of excited state \" with a  sudden decrease in the excitation gap \" .",
    "( iii ) an abrupt change in the velocity of the goldstone mode in ref .  .",
    "( iv ) exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies ( eds ) presented here as well as in ref .  , showing the level crossing for the first excited state around @xmath59 .",
    "the physical picture of the evolution of the bilayer is the following : in the ordered @xmath24 phase we have locally equal probability to find an up and down exciton .",
    "as we increase the distance between the layers , the intra - layer coulomb interaction becomes dominant and we need to place the up excitons , and separately down excitons , further apart .",
    "one natural resolution would be an ising order ( charge density wave ) , but another viable possibility is to slowly disturb the long - range ordering and create spin - textures as ground state(s ) . in the magnetic description of ref .",
    ", the tendency to create spin - textures may be recognized by the presence of frustrating next - nearest - neighbor ising couplings .",
    "thus the magnetic ( bosonic ) description of the intermediate phase may be useful along with the fermionic description presented in ref . .",
    "in this section we present results of exact diagonalization calculations performed on the torus geometry .",
    "we model a finite system of @xmath5 electrons moving on a surface spanned by vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we fix the filling fraction to be one , which leads to the condition @xmath62 .",
    "the focus of our investigation is on the liquid phases , hence we consider an isotropic torus geometry , i.e. , the length of the two vectors is the same ( aspect ratio equal to one ) .",
    "additionally , we can also vary the angle @xmath63 between the two vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 . unless otherwise specified , we fix @xmath64 , corresponding to centered rectangular symmetry .",

    "the interaction between electrons consists of an intra - layer coulomb potential , given by the fourier transform @xmath71 and the inter - layer coulomb repulsion which is screened by the bilayer distance @xmath72 the interaction potentials are made appropriately periodic ( i.e. , @xmath73 assumes values @xmath74 times an integer ) to satisfy the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "after specifying the geometry and the interaction potential , the basic procedure of exact diagonalization is to represent the hamiltonian of the system as a large finite matrix and diagonalize it on a computer . in order to extract physical information about the energy spectrum and system s eigenstates ,",
    "it is essential to label them with good quantum numbers . in this case",
    ", the complete symmetry classification was first achieved by haldane  @xcite ; the primary quantum number that emerges from such an analysis is the two - dimensional momentum that characterizes the invariance under magnetic translations .",
    "this momentum is generically conserved for any translationally invariant interaction , and we will use it below to label the eigenstates of the system ( see ref . for a recent overview of the many - body translation symmetry classification in the magnetic field ) .    in figs .",

    "what we can see in both geometries [ figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrum13dk](b)-(d ) ] as well as fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum1315 ] , is that at distance @xmath81 two distinct states  fall \" from the excited ( continuum ) part of the spectrum : for example , the state around @xmath82 and another one at @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum13dk](c ) .",

    "we explain how the  extra \" competing ground states at non - zero momenta can be interpreted as pairs of merons ( charged vortices of the superfluid state at small @xmath10 ) , whose spiraling period is commensurate with the length(s ) of the system .",
    "these spiraling configurations were considered in the work of park @xcite , but here we would like to point out that on the torus they can be viewed as a consequence of the physics of critical bosons . in this way we will relate the physics of long spiraling on the torus and critical ( composite ) bosons to the existing description in terms of @xmath0-paired states of composite fermions ( see introduction and ref . ) .    to capture the critical correlations of bosons , in the following we will consider bosons with the critical bcs pairing function @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath111 in momentum space .",
    "thus we assume that the dominant contribution in eq .",
    "( [ twodet ] ) are pairwise correlations and that the state can be considered as a bcs correlated state of bosons ( where the correlations are expressed in terms of a _ permanent _ and not the more usual determinant ) .",
    "the assumption of only pairwise correlations is by no means self - evident , and there are two reasons why it is justified : ( a ) in our system there is no real charge - pseudospin separation or , at least we have to allow for such a possibility , and thus  halves \" of the ( fused ) quasiparticles [ in appendix [ sec : appa ] , the quasiparticle in eq.([qp2 ] ) is a product of two fused  halves \" ] in the pseudospin sector are also allowed and should be captured in the critical boson description , and ( b ) the second reason is heuristic : by allowing the reduction to pairwise correlations we can describe the ground states on the torus .",
    "the pairing allows the constructions of  halves \" , e.g.  halving \" the laughlin quasihole into two non - abelions in the moore - read state @xcite , and by keeping only pairing correlations the degrees of freedom that would be forgotten ( suppressed ) otherwise will be released .",

    "the description of the intermediate phase that is based only on the neutral sector is incomplete . as usual in fqh systems , the degeneracy of the ground states on the torus",

    "these transformations can create large momenta that characterize the degenerate ground states , or alternatively different sectors of the theory [ see , for example , a recent discussion in ref . ] .",
    "thus we also have to take into account the charge part of the theory in order to describe the ground state .    since the work of moon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we know that vortex excitations in the exciton superfluid phase are charged  they are merons of unit vorticity @xmath141 and charge @xmath142 . we may then question the cft approach for constructing excitations restricted to the neutral sector [ see appendix [ sec : appa ] ] , or in other words whether the excitations obtained by eq .",
    "( [ qp2 ] ) comprise all possible vortex excitations in the intermediate critical phase .",
    "in answering this question we may start from the model function for park s states [ eq .",

    "this construction represents two merons with opposite charge and located at two opposite boundaries [ compare with eq.(135 ) in ref . ] . on the disk , this wave function represents one meron at the center of the disk and the other at the infinity .",
    "( this is somewhat similar to the construction of the non - abelian quasiparticles in the case of moore - read state which also come in pairs @xcite . ) in this way , because the meron boundary constructions define the ground states , we may expect that merons form the quasiparticle content of the critical theory .",
    "charge and spin are not separated in these constructions that describe the ground states of the critical phase .",
    "thus it was necessary to include the  gluing \" when discussing the ground state from the point of view that treated the charge and spin sector separately .",

    "for that system we know the number of the degenerate ground states on the torus ; we can consider all possible configurations ( including meron ones ) between the two edges of a cylinder @xcite , and come to the conclusion that there are 4 sectors ( 4 degenerate states on a torus ) .",
    "they can be classified as members of the chiral algebra , in which we have the basic sector that we can associate with the identity operation , two sectors due to two kinds of meron - ( anti - meron ) excitations , and a sector that is associated with the one - flux - quantum excitation i.e. laughlin quasihole , which can be viewed as a fusion of the two ( @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) different merons . in this way",
    "the four sectors can be viewed as a direct product of two subsystems , each at filling @xmath167 and having two sectors , due to the identity and laughlin excitation in each system .",
    "symbolically , if we denote the identity by @xmath168 , and @xmath165 meron by @xmath169 , and @xmath166 meron by @xmath170 , we have a direct product @xmath171 , i.e. , 4 sectors . having the extra determinant as in eq.([fpairing ] ) , beside the ( 220 )",

    "thus we obtain a total 4-fold degeneracy of the ground states on the torus .",
    "but we have to be aware that our system is far from being a simple bosonic ( 220 ) state .",
    "there we could consider excitations of a single boson , @xmath165 or @xmath166 , but this does not create an extra sector in the ( 220 ) system because the two subsystems , @xmath165 and @xmath166 , are uncorrelated , and everything boils down to the direct product of @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( sub)system . in the case of the state in eq.([fpairing ] ) , because of the interlayer correlations , we may assume that a single fermion excitation , which we will denote by @xmath172 for @xmath165 subsystem and @xmath173 for @xmath166 subsystem , is a non - trivial excitation , and may define a sector .",
    "thus we may consider @xmath174 as a way to generate all sectors @xcite .",
    "but we notice that @xmath175 is equivalent to two @xmath176 excitations , and should not represent an extra sector .",
    "thus , in this way we expect an 8-fold degeneracy in the even sector , and this is corroborated by the results in fig .",

    "the topological characterization is made difficult by the absence of a simple model hamiltonian for the model wave function [ eq .  ( [ fpairing ] ) or eq .  ( [ twodet ] ) ] .",
    "due to ( topologically ) highly intertwined ( pseudo)spin and charge , we might expect a further reduction of the number of relevant states .",
    "namely , an operation of equivalence may be introduced for two states that are connected by a gapless branch , like in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum13angle ] .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the low - lying spectrum , in both even and odd sector is robust and independent of system size , up to @xmath177 particles in the even sector , and up to @xmath77 in the odd sector , and it is not in the accordance with the naive expectation of 4 degenerate ground states in the even sector that can be found in the previous literature , or as follows from the charge - pseudospin separated picture of the intermediate state .    by comparing the tentative degeneracies on the torus ( 8 states in the even sector and 9 states in the odd sector ) with the predictions in the even and odd sector in section [ sec : competing ] on the basis of @xmath112 bcs paired critical bosons",

    "a possible reason for the presence of composite fermions can be seen in a formal way by also noting that , by considering charge and pseudospin sector separately , we have to allow quasiparticle constructions which are not single - valued functions of electron coordinates ( assuming that the gluing of charge and pseudospin will heal this ) .",

    "<S> quantum hall bilayer phase diagram with respect to interlayer distance bears a remarkable similarity with phase diagrams of strongly correlated systems as a function of doping , with magnetic ordering on the one end and fermi - liquid - like behavior on the other . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has been suggested  @xcite that a bcs correlated state of composite fermions with @xmath0-wave pairing may exist in the intermediate region . in the same region , </S>",
    "<S> an exact diagonalization study in the torus geometry @xcite pointed out the existence of state(s ) with pseudospin spiraling order . </S>",
    "<S> here we reconcile these two descriptions of the intermediate state by considering the underlying bosonic representation of the composite fermion paired state in the long distance limit , and by performing extensive exact diagonalizations on the torus . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the spiraling states belong to the manifold of degenerate ground state(s ) , and are a consequence of bose condensation of the quasiparticles ( with critical algebraic correlations ) at non - zero momenta in the two pseudospin states . </S>",
    "<S> the spiraling states , generated in this way as spin - textures , can be identified with meron - antimeron constructions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , merons  </S>",
    "<S> the fractionally charged vortex excitations of the xy magnetically ordered state  constitute some of the topological sectors . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that merons are deconfined in the intermediate state , and allow for a smooth transition between the magnetically ordered and fermi - liquid - like phases , in which they are bound in pairs . </S>"
