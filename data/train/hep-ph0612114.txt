    "the standard model ( sm ) , although has passed many precision experimental tests , still has a number of outstanding problems which beg for a more fundamental theory . in terms of phenomenology , there are many places to test the more fundamental theory and , quite often , it is not one piece of phenomenology but a specific pattern of many pieces of phenomenology that fulfils this job .",
    "neutrino oscillation clearly indicates the beyond sm physics in that it violates the accidental symmetry @xmath7 of sm lepton flavor .",
    "moreover , the tiny neutrino masses can be most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism @xcite , indicating the majorana nature of neutrinos that leads to violation of another accidental symmetry @xmath8 of sm at a very high scale close to the grand unification theory ( gut ) scale .",
    "for this reason , studying neutrino oscillation in the gut framework becomes particularly interesting .    in so(10 )",
    "gut , quarks and leptons are unified into a single 16 multiplet , yet experimental data shows that the 2 - 3 ( generation ) mixing is dramatically different in the quark and lepton sectors . while the quark mixing angle",
    "@xmath9 is around 0.04 , the lepton mixing angle @xmath10 ( atmospheric mixing angle ) is quite large and could be a maximum of @xmath11 .",
    "this difference can be rather naturally explained by the lopsidedness in the 2 - 3 sector of mass matrices of down - type quarks and charged leptons : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is of order one and generates large mixing for left - handed ( lh ) charged leptons and right - handed ( rh ) down - type quarks , while @xmath14 is much smaller than one and generates tiny mixing for rh charged leptons and lh down - type quarks",
    ". the group - theoretical origin of this lopsidedness can be most transparently seen in terms of the su(5 ) multiplet it is the charge conjugate of rh down - type quarks that sit together with lh lepton doublet in the @xmath15 representation of su(5 ) .",
    "this lopsided structure can also be generated from so(10 ) group structure .    indeed , realistic so(10 )",
    "gut models with lopsided mass matrices have been constructed @xcite in the literature .",
    "these different versions differ in many aspects but have the common structure as shown in eq .",
    "these models fit very well with all the fermion masses and mixings , including the neutrino sector through the first type of sea - saw mechanism , as well as producing the correct amount of baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis @xcite .    given the successes of the so(10 ) models with lopsided flavor structure",
    ", we are motivated to address the following question : what is the most characteristic feature of these models and where to test it ?    from the lopsided structure itself as shown in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it is clear that the most characteristic feature of the models with lopsided structure is the large rh 2 - 3 mixing of down - type quarks associated with the large neutrino atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "the question is where and how to see its signature in other places for testing beyond sm physics .",
    "clearly this rh mixing does not show up in the quark ckm ( cabbibo - kobayashi - moskawa ) matrix , which is , in fact , the point of introducing lopsidedness to generate large lepton mixing and small quark mixing simultaneously .",
    "however , in the supersymmetry ( susy ) theory , this large rh mixing has the potential of generating sizable off - diagonal elements of soft mass matrices of squarks which , in turn , can be manifested in the flavor - changing neutral current interaction of down - type quarks , namely , the @xmath16 transition .",
    "the penguin dominated @xmath0 transition has long been regarded as the golden channel for probing new physics . moreover ,",
    "if there are phases associated with the new physics contributing to this transition , there could be new cp violations in b physics . within the sm ,",
    "the indirect cp asymmetry parameter @xmath1 and @xmath2 are essentially the same as that of @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "however , the experimental values of @xmath1 and @xmath19 from babar and belle @xcite show large deviations from the sm prediction : @xmath20 with the average of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which display 1.7@xmath13 and @xmath23 deviations from the sm predictions , respectively .",
    "this significant discrepancy between sm prediction and experiment data has generated tremendous amount of effort in searching beyond sm physics .    among these efforts , it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that there could be correlation between the large atmospheric mixing and the large @xmath24 transition , based on the connection between lh charged leptons and rh down - type quarks in the framework of so(10 ) gut .",
    "however , it should be noted that , in fact , this correlation depends exclusively on the lopsided structure , which is the only way of realizing the possible connection between lh charged leptons and rh down - type quarks .",
    "within other realistic so(10 ) models @xcite without lopsided structure , a set of parameters that are of the same order are combined constructively and destructively to give large atmospheric angle and small quark 2 - 3 mixing angle , respectively . therefore , in these so(10 )",
    "models @xcite , there is typically no large rh down - type quark mixing associated with the large atmospheric mixing , and hence the correlation between atmospheric mixing and the @xmath0 transition is not realized .    knowing the correlation between atmospheric neutrino mixing and the @xmath0 transition through the lopsided structure in so(10 ) , we test this possibility by investigating the predictions of cp conserving and cp violating observables associated with the @xmath0 transition in b physics from a particular lopsided susy so(10 ) model constructed by us @xcite .",
    "our study shows that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 could indeed have large deviations from their sm values because of the large @xmath0 transition induced by the lopsided flavor structure in the susy context . moreover",
    ", we find a particular pattern of correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which makes this class of models with lopsided structure distinguishable from other types of models .",
    "we expect , for example , the similar result from the model in @xcite , because these two models are nearly the same in the down - type quark sector .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the calculation of flavor violation variables from the so(10 ) model described in @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the predictions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with the constraint from @xmath25 as well as the recent measurement of @xmath3 , in the model . finally , we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "the susy flavor violation and flavor - violating cp violation in the quark sector are induced by the off - diagonal elements of squark mass - squared matrices @xmath26 with @xmath27 indicating the chirality . in the mass insertion approximation ( mia )",
    "approach , the relevant parameters are @xmath28s , which are the @xmath26 divided by the average squark mass - squared .",
    "we restrict ourselves to studying the gluino contribution , which is believed to be the dominant one due to enhancement by the large gauge coupling @xmath29 @xcite . in the gluino - induced contribution ,",
    "the relevant parameters for the @xmath0 transition are the @xmath30 of down - type quark .",
    "we are going to show how these parameters are calculated in the so(10 ) gut model in this section .    with the universality condition imposed at the susy breaking scale @xmath31 , which we take as the planck scale @xmath32 , and with the magnitude of @xmath33-parameter fixed from the radiative electroweak breaking , there are five susy parameters left : @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is fixed to be 10 when our so(10 ) model is constructed to fit fermion masses @xcite . the phase of @xmath33-parameter , @xmath36 , is constrained from the electric dipole moment ( edm ) bounds , which , if assuming possible cancellation exists , restrict @xmath36 to be within @xmath37 from 0 or @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we take the @xmath36 to be in the range of @xmath39 for concreteness .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath40 at @xmath31 ( see @xcite for justification ) . a nonzero @xmath41 should not bring any significant change to the results since the alignment condition is assumed . finally , we set two soft masses @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are the universal soft scalar mass and gaugino mass at @xmath31 , respectively , to be within 1 tev",
    ".    the off - diagonal elements of squark mass - squared matrices are generated from the renormalization group ( rg ) running between susy breaking scale @xmath31 and the electroweak scale @xmath44 .",
    "the gut symmetry breaking scale , @xmath45 , divides this running into two parts : above-@xmath46 running and below-@xmath46 running .    in the following discussion",
    ", we will stick to the super - km basis for the squark fields , in which the neutral current quark - gaugino - squark vertices are diagonal .",
    "below the @xmath46 , there are two yukawa couplings in the quark sector : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the running of @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath50 which is diagonal in the super - km basis of rh down - type squarks .",
    "therefore no off - diagonal element of @xmath49 should be generated from the below-@xmath46 running .",
    "nevertheless , the running of @xmath51 involve both @xmath52 and @xmath53 . while the former is diagonal in the super - km basis of lh down - type squarks , the latter is not and could generate the off - diagonal elements of @xmath51 .",
    "we have @xmath54 where the @xmath55 is in the basis of su(2 ) doublet @xmath56",
    "that @xmath57 is diagonal .    above the @xmath46 , all the 16 fermions , including the rh neutrino , are in the 16 spinor representation of so(10 ) .",
    "the soft mass - squared @xmath58 is renormalized by the single renormalizable operator @xmath59 in the model . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial universal soft mass - squared @xmath60 is not kept at @xmath46 : @xmath61 .",
    "the change of 3 - 3 element @xmath62 is due to the renormalization by the operator @xmath63 : @xmath64 the parameter @xmath65 is not completely fixed in the model and we choose it to be 1/2 , which is in the reasonable range .",
    "this non - universal , diagonal , soft mass - squared matrix is in the gut basis . after being rotated to the super - km basis ,",
    "off - diagonal elements of @xmath66 are generated : @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the unitary transformation matrices that diagonalize the down - type quark mass matrix @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath70 is obtained from @xmath71 divided by the average of its diagonal elements . finally , the @xmath72 is the sum of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , while the @xmath75 is only from above - gut running .",
    "the point mentioned in sec .",
    "i that the correlation between atmospheric neutrino mixing and @xmath0 transition depends exclusively on the lopsided structure can be explicitly seen here : in the lopsided flavor structure , the 2 - 3 element of @xmath76 is large and induces a large 2 - 3 rotation @xmath77 in @xmath78 . this large rotation in turn produces a large @xmath79 as shown in eq . ( 5 ) .",
    "finally , the large off - diagonal squark masses can generate a large @xmath16 transition .",
    "although we set @xmath40 at @xmath31 , it could be generated through radiative corrections .",
    "for @xmath80 , the running below @xmath46 , being proportional to @xmath57 , only induces diagonal elements in the super - km basis .",
    "however , running from @xmath31 to @xmath46 does generate off - diagonal elements of @xmath81 . in the gut basis @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath14 , and @xmath87 are parameters fixed in the model @xcite .",
    "the pre - coefficients 63/2 , 45 , and 61 are sums of casimirs of so(10 ) representation involved in the operator @xmath88 , @xmath89_{10}$ ] , and @xmath89_{10 } 45_h$ ] , respectively .",
    "again , one simply applies @xmath90 on both sides of @xmath91 to go to the super - km basis @xmath92 which , together with the diagonal @xmath33 term contribution , gives the full @xmath93 : @xmath94 .",
    "finally , @xmath95 is obtained as @xmath96 .    to see the characteristic feature of the lopsided structure , it is instructive to look at the size of all the @xmath85 s .",
    "taking @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 as an example , we have @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "obviously , the @xmath104 is of several orders of magnitude larger than all the other @xmath85 s .",
    "moreover , giving this large @xmath104 , a large effective @xmath105 is generated from the double mass insertion : @xmath106 , which is @xmath107 for the same set of parameters .",
    "the effective @xmath108 still remains small in the case of double mass insertion due to the smallness of @xmath109 . as a result ,",
    "the lopsided model predicts large @xmath104 and @xmath110 , and small @xmath109 and @xmath111 .",
    "the most general effective hamiltonians @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the non - leptonic @xmath114 and @xmath115 processes are @xmath116 where @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 are the wilson coefficients and the local operators ( not same in both hamiltonians ) , respectively .",
    "all the relevant contributions of high energy physics above @xmath121 mass , including the susy particle contribution , enter the wilson coefficients at @xmath122 : @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the matrix elements of local operators are , however , obtained at the energy scale of bottom quark mass @xmath125 . therefore , one needs to obtain the wilson coefficients at low energy by solving the renormalization group equations of qcd and qed in the sm : @xmath126 where the evolution matrix @xmath127 for @xmath114 and @xmath128 wilson coefficients can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the sm and susy contributions to wilson coefficients can be found in refs .",
    "it is worth noting that the susy contribution depends on the squark mass @xmath129 and gluino mass @xmath130 , which are larger than the universal soft scalar mass @xmath42 and gaugino mass @xmath43 due to the rg running .",
    "we use the matrix elements of local operators evaluated in qcd factorization ( qcdf ) , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which makes the strong phase calculable , yet introduces undetermined parameters @xmath131 and phases @xmath132 .    to make prediction of @xmath1 , we first impose constraints on the parameter space by requiring the prediction of branching ratio and cp asymmetry of @xmath25 and @xmath3 to be within the experimental bounds .    the gluino contribution to",
    "the branching ratio @xmath133 is @xcite @xmath134 where the loop functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 with @xmath137 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental bound and the sm uncertainty together require that the gluino contribution @xmath138 .",
    "the bound on the cp asymmetry @xmath139 plays no significant role in constraining the parameter space .",
    "therefore we neglect its discussion here , although we have included it in the calculation in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the d0 and cdf collaborations @xcite have reported new results for @xmath3 : @xmath140 while the best fit value in sm is @xmath141 .",
    "this imposes the constraint @xmath142 .",
    "one should notice that this bound remains valid if one considers the uncertainty in the sm value and assumes @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "the decay amplitudes of @xmath144 are given by @xcite @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the transition form factor evaluated at transfered momentum of order of @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath149 s are dependent on qcdf parameters @xmath131 and @xmath132 in such a way as given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the susy contribution modifies the cp asymmetry as @xmath150 where @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 are defined in the ratio @xmath154 where the @xmath151 is the absolute value of the ratio , the @xmath152 is the susy cp violating weak phase which depends on the phases in @xmath85s , and the @xmath155 is the cp conserving strong phase that depends on @xmath132 .",
    "we deal with @xmath2 in the similar way as we deal with @xmath1 , with the relevant coefficients also found in ref .",
    "one thing worth noting is that due to the fact that , contrary to the @xmath156 transition , the initial and final states in @xmath157 transition have opposite parity and therefore @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 appear in such combinations as @xmath161 in the amplitude @xmath162 instead of @xmath163 in @xmath164 as shown in eq .",
    "since @xmath165 depends on @xmath166 , while @xmath167 depends on @xmath168 , this difference makes the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the case with large @xmath166 different from the case with large @xmath168 .",
    "in fact , as shown in the general analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , the deviations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from the sm value are in the same direction if @xmath166 is large and in the opposite direction if @xmath168 is large .",
    "this turns out to be important in the following discussion of the correlation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 predictions from the lopsided model .    besides the susy parameters @xmath169 which are discussed in sec .",
    "ii , the undetermined parameters @xmath131 are constrained by @xmath170 to be within @xmath171 @xcite , and the strong phase @xmath132 is not constrained .    by scanning over the allowed ranges of undetermined parameters @xmath172 and imposing the bound of @xmath3 , as well as @xmath173 and @xmath174",
    ", we find the allowed @xmath175 shown in fig .",
    "1 : there is a large parameter space of @xmath176 satisfying the bound .",
    "the corresponding predictions of @xmath1 and @xmath19 are shown in fig .",
    "2 , from which we see that the large @xmath104 does push the @xmath1 and @xmath19 off their sm value @xmath177 . for the purpose of comparison",
    ", we set by hand the @xmath104 to be of the size of @xmath109 , which would be the case without lopsided structure , and present the corresponding prediction of @xmath5 and @xmath2 in fig .",
    "3 , which , together with fig .",
    "2 , shows clearly that the large deviation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from their sm values are exclusively due to the large @xmath104 from the lopsided structure .    while fig .",
    "2 shows that the lopsided structure may explain the anomalies of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the correlation between the predictions of these two quantities , shown in fig .",
    "4 , indicate an interesting pattern : the large @xmath168 push @xmath1 and @xmath2 in opposite directions . for points",
    "that @xmath1 goes small , the @xmath2 goes larger , and vice versa .",
    "as discussed above , this specific pattern is intrinsic to the large @xmath104 , which induces large @xmath168 yet leaves @xmath166 small .",
    "therefore , it is tightly associated with the lopsided flavor structure . this specific pattern of correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 means that the lopsided flavor structure can not be responsible for both anomalies simultaneously . if future experiments confirm that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indeed both significantly smaller than the sm values , the lopsided so(10 ) model is ruled out unless one assumes that susy parameters are such that large @xmath104 from the lopsided structure makes no significant contribution to the @xmath0 transition and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 anomalies are from other beyond sm physics sources . on the other hand ,",
    "if future experiments show the deviation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from their sm values in opposite directions , it would be a strong evidence for the lopsided flavor structure .",
    "in this paper , we pointed out that a possible correlation between large atmospheric neutrino mixing and the @xmath0 transition , first discussed in ref . @xcite , in fact , depends exclusively on the lopsided so(10 ) structure .",
    "we studied the prediction of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from a realistic so(10 ) model with lopsided flavor structure with the constraints from @xmath3 , @xmath4 applied .",
    "we found that both quantities can show significant deviations from their sm values due to the lopsided flavor structure , but with a specific type of correlation .",
    "we discussed that the specific correlation of the two quantities can be used to test the flavor structure by future experiments .",
