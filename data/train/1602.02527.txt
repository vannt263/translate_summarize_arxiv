    "in a society or community , individuals and their relationships form a social network . for some matter that each individual gets to express her own opinion about , individuals influence each others regarding it through such a social network .",
    "for example , the matter can be adopting a new innovation / product , and the individuals are potential users / consumers while their opinions could be tendency to adopt the innovation or the preference toward the product ; for some political issue that may need public consensus , the public have different opinions or thoughts about it . in any case , an individual is often affected by her friends / neighbors in the social network when making up her mind . the opinion forming process in a social network can be naturally thought as an opinion influencing and updating dynamics .",
    "this has attracted researchers interest a while ago in mathematical sociology , and more recently in theoretical computer science .",
    "degroot @xcite modeled the opinion formation process by associating each individual with a numeric - value opinion and letting the opinion be updated by a weighted average of the opinions from her friends and her own , where the weights represent how much she is influenced by her friends .",
    "this update dynamics will converge to a fixed point in which all individuals hold the same opinion , i.e. , a consensus .",
    "however , we can easily observe that in the real world , the consensus is difficult to reach .",
    "friedkin and johnson @xcite differentiated an _ expressed opinion _ that each individual in the networks updates over time from an _ internal opinion _ that each individual is born with and stays unchanged .",
    "thus , an individual would be always influenced by her inherent belief , and the dynamics converges to an unique equilibrium , which may not be a consensus .",
    "bindel et al .",
    "@xcite viewed the updating rule mentioned above equivalently as each player updating her expressed opinion to minimize her quadratic individual cost function , which consists of the disagreement between her expressed opinion and those of her friends , and the difference between her expressed and internal opinions .",
    "they analyzed how socially good or bad the system can be at equilibrium compared to the optimum solution in terms of the _ price of anarchy _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the ratio of the social cost at the worst equilibrium to the optimal social cost .",
    "( notions of equilibria will be given in section  2 . )",
    "the price of anarchy is at most @xmath0 in undirected graphs and is unbounded in directed graphs ( due to a star graph with a center only influencing the others but is not influenced at all by the others , or even directed bounded - degree trees with degrees high enough ) .",
    "nevertheless , a bounded price of anarchy can be obtained for weighted eulerian graphs , in particular , a tight upper bound of @xmath1 for directed cycles and an upper bound of @xmath2 for @xmath3-regular graphs .",
    "another work closely related to that of bindel et al .",
    "is by bhawalkar et al . @xcite .",
    "the individual cost functions are assumed to be  locally - smooth \" in the sense of @xcite and may be more general than quadratic , for example , convex .",
    "the price of anarchy for undirected graphs with quadratic cost functions is at most @xmath1 .",
    "they also allowed social networks to change by letting players choose @xmath4-nearest neighbors through opinion updates and bounded the price of anarchy . on the other hand , chierichetti et al .",
    "@xcite considered the games with discrete preferences , where an expressed and internal opinions are chosen from a discrete set and distances measuring  similarity \" between opinions correspond to costs .",
    "when graphs are directed , a bounded price of anarchy is only known for weighted eulerian graphs where the total incoming weights equal to the total outgoing weights at each node @xcite , which may seem rather restricted .",
    "thus , we are interested _ to bound the price of anarchy for games with directed graphs more general than weighted eulerian graphs _ ( even with just quadratic individual cost functions ) in this article .",
    "note that although the result of @xcite is indeed for directed graphs and gives bounded price of anarchy , their setting is different from ours . in their model , the weights on the @xmath4 neighbors are uniform , and more importantly , the @xmath4 neighbors of a node is not fixed , as its action in the game includes choosing its @xmath4 neighbors in addition to its opinion . therefore , it is related to but different from what we propose to tackle here .",
    "we first bound the price of anarchy for a more general class of directed graphs with conditions intuitively meaning that each node does not influence the others more than she is influenced by herself and the others , where the bounds depend on such influence differences ( in a ratio ) .",
    "this generalizes the previous results on directed graphs , and recovers and matches the previous bounds in some specific classes of ( directed ) eulerian graphs .",
    "we then show the existence of an example that just slightly violates the conditions but with an unbounded price of anarchy .",
    "we further propose more research directions in the discussions and future work .",
    "we describe a social network as a weighted graph @xmath5 for directed graph @xmath6 and matrix @xmath7_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the node set @xmath8 of size @xmath9 is the selfish players , and the edge set @xmath10 is the relationships between any pair of nodes .",
    "the edge weight @xmath11 is a real number and represents how much player  @xmath12 is influenced by player  @xmath13 ; note that weight @xmath14 can be seen as a self - loop weight , i.e. , how much player  @xmath12 influences ( or is influenced by ) herself .",
    "each ( node ) player has an internal opinion @xmath15 , which is unchanged and not affected by opinion updates .",
    "an _ opinion formation game _ can be expressed as an instance @xmath16 that combines weighted graph @xmath5 and vector @xmath17 .",
    "each player s strategy is an expressed opinion @xmath18 , which may be different from her @xmath15 and gets updated .",
    "both @xmath15 and @xmath18 are real numbers .",
    "the individual cost function of player  @xmath12 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the strategy profile / vector and @xmath21 is the set of the neighbors of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "it measures the disagreement between her expressed opinion and those of her friends , and the difference between her expressed and internal opinions .",
    "other functions could also be used other than the square one here , for example , convex functions @xcite .",
    "each node minimizes her cost @xmath23 by choosing her expressed opinion @xmath18 .",
    "we analyze the game when it stabilizes , i.e. , at equilibrium .      in a ( pure ) nash equilibrium @xmath20 ,",
    "each player  @xmath12 s strategy is @xmath18 such that given @xmath24 ( i.e. , the opinion vector of all players except @xmath12 ) for any other @xmath25 , @xmath26 according to @xcite , in such an equilibrium , the condition @xmath27 holds for any player @xmath12 .",
    "this can be shown by taking the derivative of @xmath23 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath18 , setting it to @xmath28 for each @xmath12 , and solving the equality system since very player  @xmath12 minimizes @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath23 is continuously differentiable .",
    "the social cost function here is @xmath29 , the sum of the individual costs .",
    "nash equilibria can be far from the ( centralized ) social optimum in terms of a social cost @xcite . to measure the ( in)efficiency of equilibria , the price of anarchy @xcite is defined as the ratio of the worst equilibrium s social cost to the optimal social cost .      to bound the price of anarchy , the _ local smoothness _",
    "framework developed by roughgarden and schoppmann @xcite is a promising analysis technique in algorithmic game theory .",
    "it has been applied in @xcite to obtain the price of anarchy bounds there and similar techniques have been used in many other games @xcite .",
    "the local smoothness technique is slightly different from the smoothness techniques of @xcite .",
    "the local smoothness technique is sometimes more suitable since it gives tight(er ) bounds while the smoothness technique does not in some games .",
    "we briefly summarize this technique in the following .",
    "the inequality intuitively means that summing up individual costs after some unilateral local deviations to @xmath30 s from any strategy profile @xmath20 can still be upper bounded by a combination of the social costs @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( where the derivative term accounts for localness ) , implying that @xmath31 is not too far from @xmath32 . as in @xcite , we assume that the cost function @xmath23 of each player @xmath12 is continuously differentiable w.r.t . her strategy .",
    "a cost - minimization game is @xmath33-locally smooth if for any strategy profiles @xmath34 and @xmath20 , @xmath35    we have the following from an extension theorem of @xcite .",
    "[ thm : extension ] if @xmath36 is a correlated equilibrium and @xmath34 is the social optimum in a @xmath33-locally smooth game , for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then the correlated ( thus , pure and mixed ) price of anarchy , @xmath39/c(\\mathbf{o})$ ] , is at most @xmath40 .    with this",
    ", our goal becomes finding suitable @xmath41 and @xmath42 values to satisfy inequality  ( [ def : smooth ] ) , which immediately gives price - of - anarchy bounds .",
    "we first generalize the result @xcite about bounded price of anarchy for weighted eulerian graphs to a more general class of directed graphs with conditions intuitively meaning that each node does not influence the others more than she is influenced ( by herself and the others ) .",
    "we then show that there exists an example that just slightly violates the conditions and gives an unbounded price of anarchy .",
    "recall from @xcite that in a weighted eulerian graph , @xmath43 for every node @xmath12 , which means that the influence each node exerts on the others is exactly the same as that it receives from the others .",
    "here we relax the condition and obtain the following .",
    "[ thm : bound ] consider any value @xmath44 and any weighted graph @xmath5 such that for any node @xmath12 , @xmath45 then the price of anarchy for any opinion formation game on @xmath5 is at most @xmath46 .    to make the price of anarchy bound as small as possible , one chooses @xmath47 to be the largest possible value such that the condition in still holds for every node @xmath12 . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath47 captures a bound on how much more ( as a ratio ) a node is influenced by itself and the others than it influences the others .",
    "we want to show @xmath33-local smoothness for any opinion formation game on such a weighted graph .",
    "let @xmath20 be a nash equilibrium and @xmath34 the social optimum .",
    "we start by plugging the definition of @xmath23 into the left - hand side of  ( [ def : smooth ] ) and rearranging terms as follows @xmath48    by the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , the expression above is at most @xmath53 the inequality follows from rearranging terms and the inequality @xmath54 . by the condition @xmath55 for all @xmath12 , we then have @xmath56 and @xmath57 . by theorem  [ thm :",
    "extension ] , the upper bound of @xmath58 is @xmath59 .    our bound recovers the tight bound of @xmath1 for directed cycles in @xcite since @xmath60 in any directed cycle with @xmath61 and @xmath62 for all @xmath12 .",
    "our bound also matches the upper bound of @xmath2 for @xmath3-regular eulerian graphs in @xcite since @xmath63 in any @xmath3-regular eulerian graph with @xmath61 and @xmath64 for all @xmath12 .",
    "[ thm : example ] there exists an example just slightly violating the conditions  ( [ thm : condition ] ) in theorem  [ thm : bound ] with an unbounded price of anarchy .",
    "we show the existence by a probabilistic argument .",
    "consider a directed tree in which each node , except the root , has out - degree @xmath65 and this out - edge is directed to its parent node .",
    "let the in - degree of any node , except the leaves , at level  @xmath12 be a random variable @xmath66 .",
    "all @xmath67 s are independent from each other , and have the same expectation @xmath68=p$ ] , for a constant @xmath69 slightly above @xmath65 .",
    "the root has self - loop weight @xmath70 , and all the nodes at level  @xmath12 have self - loop weight @xmath71 and weight @xmath65 to its parent at level @xmath72 .",
    "let the root be at level  @xmath28 and let the leaves be at level @xmath73 .",
    "let the root have internal opinion @xmath65 and all others have @xmath28 .",
    "at nash equilibrium , the root expresses @xmath74 and has cost @xmath75 , while it is easy to show by induction that every node at level @xmath12 expresses @xmath76 ( as @xmath77 ) and has cost @xmath78 .",
    "as the expected number of nodes at level @xmath12 equals @xmath79= \\prod_{j=1}^i e[x_j ] = p^i$ ] by independence of all @xmath67 s , the expected social cost at nash equilibrium is @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",
    "the social optimum cost is at most @xmath70 , and hence the expected price of anarchy is @xmath81 , for a constant @xmath69 .",
    "note that the tree may have nodes with in - degree @xmath1 , and they violate the condition .",
    "however , as @xmath69 approaches @xmath65 , one can show by a chernoff bound that with high probability , the fraction of such violating nodes is very small ( close to @xmath82 ) and the price of anarchy remains @xmath83 .",
    "this implies the existence of a weighted directed tree such that the fraction of violating nodes is very small while the price of anarchy is unbounded when @xmath9 is large .",
    "given the results that we just present , an immediate extension may be to give more refined bounds for classes of directed graphs or various subclasses .",
    "another natural direction is to improve the price of anarchy with so - called  stackelberg strategies \" : one way to control some nodes is to make them express something that leads to approximate the optimal social cost or minimize the price of anarchy given the uncontrolled ones still expressing selfishly .",
    "if one can control an arbitrary number of nodes , a straightforward way is to control the nodes that violate conditions  ( [ thm : condition ] ) simply making them express their opinions at social optimum and analyze the induced equilibrium reusing theorem  [ thm : bound ] to at least get a bounded price of anarchy .",
    "theorem  [ thm : example ] implies when we can control only @xmath4 nodes , @xmath4 has to be at least the number of nodes violating their corresponding conditions to get a bounded price of anarchy .",
    "so , if we focus on lower bounds on the size of the controlled nodes for a bounded price of anarchy , consider @xmath84 disconnected stars of size @xmath84 each , where for each star all the leaf nodes ( except the center ) are only in influenced by the center and the center is not influenced by anyone . in this case , at least @xmath84 centers need to be controlled or the price of anarchy bound would be unbounded .",
    "there may exist stricter lower bounds than this .",
    "note that although the results of @xcite identified some @xmath4-subset of nodes to control , just as we aim to do , we have a different social cost that is the sum of all nodes individual costs from theirs , such as the sum of all nodes opinions in @xcite , which happens to be  submodular \" and enables applicability of greedy algorithms there .",
    "other ways to control nodes may include changing their internal opinions @xcite .",
    "more broadly , designing the networks such as deleting edges ( or adding edges ) to perform socially better has also been briefly discussed @xcite .",
