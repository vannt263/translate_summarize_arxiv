    "since the pioneering work of dicke @xcite on cooperative spontaneous emission , a great deal of attention has been devoted to the interaction of the radiation field with a collection of two - level atoms located within a distance much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation . such a system is commonly referred to as the dicke model ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . a particular case of the dicke model , when atoms interact with a single - mode radiation field inside a cavity , was considered by tavis and cummings @xcite .",
    "the tavis - cummings hamiltonian is mathematically equivalent to the trilinear boson hamiltonian describing various nonlinear optical processes @xcite .",
    "the single - atom version , known as the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , is the simplest and one of the most popular models of quantum optics . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the jaynes - cummings model shows a variety of interesting nonclassical phenomena such as vacuum - field rabi oscillations , sub - poissonian photon statistics , and squeezing of the radiation field ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting quantum features of the jaynes - cummings model is the phenomenon of collapses and revivals of the rabi oscillations , which manifests itself in the clearest way when the cavity field is prepared initially in the coherent state @xcite .",
    "the shape of collapses and revivals is determined by the initial photon - number distribution .",
    "a similar behavior can be found also in the many - atom case @xcite . for a sufficiently strong coherent field",
    ", the nonlinearity in the rabi frequency is slight and the system exhibits regular dynamics in the form of collapses and revivals of the oscillations .",
    "however , in the many - atom case there exist anharmonic collective corrections which modify the shape of the collapses and revivals related to the photon - distribution mechanism @xcite . in the present work we study in detail these collective effects for different initial atomic states .",
    "if atoms are prepared initially in the ground state or in the fully - excited state , then the system behaves rather similarly to the single - atom case , although collective effects manifest themselves clearly in the length of the revival time .",
    "but , the results are different when the atoms are prepared initially in the half - excited dicke state .",
    "this state is well known as the superradiant atomic state in the context of collective spontaneous emission in open space @xcite .",
    "it was also found @xcite that the half - excited dicke state strongly modifies the resonance fluorescence spectrum of the atomic system .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this state was rarely considered in the context of the tavis - cummings ( cavity ) version of the dicke model . when the atoms are prepared in the half - excited dicke state",
    "the system exhibits a number of interesting phenomena .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of the rabi oscillations is strongly suppressed and relative intensities of revivals are essentially changed .",
    "this suppresion of the revival amplitude is similar to the trapping phenomenon occuring in the case of a single atom prepared in the equally weighted superposition of the two levels @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that the nonlinear character of the jaynes - cummings model leads to squeezing in one of the quadratures of an initially coherent cavity field .",
    "it was also predicted @xcite that strong squeezing can be obtained in the jaynes - cummings model near the revival times for large initial intensities of the field .",
    "this phenomenon of strong revival - time squeezing was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite using the factorization approximation for the so - called semiclassical atomic states @xcite .",
    "butler and drummond @xcite showed that short - time squeezing can be enhanced in the dicke model compared to the single - atom case .",
    "seke @xcite considered field and atomic squeezing in the dicke model without the rotating - wave approximation and in the presence of losses . analytical approaches to squeezing in the strong - field limit @xcite and in the weak - field limit @xcite were presented .",
    "higher - order squeezing in the dicke model was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . for atoms prepared initially in the ground state or in the fully - excited state ,",
    "the uncertainty of the field quadrature rapidly oscillates and squeezing occurs during short periods of time at the very beginning of the time evolution . on the long - time scale the temporal behavior of the quadrature uncertainty",
    "is correlated with times of collapses and revivals of the rabi oscillations . on the other hand , for the initial half - excited dicke state",
    ", the behavior of squeezing is qualitatively different .",
    "the quadrature uncertainty oscillates on the long - time scale , with a period of the order of the revival half - time , and strong squeezing is obtained in the case of two atoms .",
    "the value of squeezing is enhanced by the intensity of the initial coherent field .",
    "this phenomenon is of the same nature as revival - time squeezing in the jaynes - cummings model and can be explained using the factorization approximation for the semiclassical atomic states . in general , squeezing is better and its duration is much longer for the initial two - atom half - excited dicke state than for the ground and fully - excited states .",
    "we consider the resonant interaction between @xmath0 two - level atoms and the single - mode radiation field inside a lossless cavity . in the rotating - wave approximation ,",
    "the tavis - cummings interaction hamiltonian reads ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 here and in the following we use the interaction picture . in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) @xmath3 is the coupling constant , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the annihilation and creation operators of the field mode , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the collective atomic raising and lowering operators .",

    "an interesting physical realization of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is given by the coupling of the internal levels of atoms or ions to a mode of their quantized oscillatory motion in a harmonic trap @xcite .    the total excitation operator @xmath11 commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) and is an integral of motion .",
    "another integral of motion is the su(2 ) casimir operator @xmath12 .",
    "we describe the state of the atomic system in terms of the su(2 ) orthonormal basis @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 ) , the states @xmath13 are the symmetric dicke states : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the upper and lower states , respectively , of the @xmath19th atom , and the summation is over all possible permutations of @xmath0 atoms . if only symmetric atomic states are considered , then the ` cooperative number ' @xmath20 is equal to @xmath21 and @xmath22 is just the number of excited atoms .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath23 of the atom - field system can be decomposed into a direct sum of finite - dimensional invariant subspaces @xmath24 : @xmath25 each invariant subspace @xmath24 is spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; for @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if the field is initially in the fock state @xmath33 and the atoms are in the dicke state @xmath34 , the state of the system will evolve in the invariant subspace @xmath24 with @xmath35 .",
    "for the field and/or atoms prepared initially in a superposition state , one should take into account contributions from different subspaces .",
    "the exact solution of the problem is obtained by the diagonalization of the interaction hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in each of the invariant subspaces @xmath24 involved @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that in the basis @xmath36 the hamiltonian is given by a tridiagonal matrix with symmetric eigenvalues and the corresponding characteristic equation can be reduced to an algebraic equation of order @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "therefore , an analytical solution is possible when only invariant subspaces with @xmath38 are involved .",
    "however , already for @xmath39 , analytical solutions are rather complicated @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath40 the eigenvalues are not equidistant , so the time evolution is not periodic even within a single subspace .",
    "semiclassical approximate solutions were proposed @xcite which give the time evolution of systems governed by a trilinear hamiltonian of type ( [ ham ] ) in terms of elliptical functions .",
    "a perturbative analytical approach to the problem with weak fields was developed by kozierowski and co - workers @xcite . in the present work we use the exact solution based on the numerical diagonalization of the interaction hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "we study the temporal behavior of the atom - field system in the dicke model for the cavity field prepared initially in the coherent state @xmath41 : @xmath42 .",
    "the initial atomic state is supposed to be one of the dicke states @xmath13 ( recall that @xmath43 ) .",
    "two possibilities which are frequently considered in the literature are the fully - excited state @xmath44 and the ground state @xmath45 .",
    "we are also interested in the half - excited dicke state @xmath46 .",
    "since the coherent field state is a superposition of many fock states @xmath47 , the invariant subspaces @xmath24 with different values of @xmath48 contribute to the evolution .",
    "the temporal behavior of the atomic inversion @xmath49 is given by the sum of the appropriately weighted atomic responses to each fock state .",
    "( the mean photon number @xmath50 is connected with the atomic inversion by the fact that @xmath51 is a constant . ) in the resonant jaynes - cummings model ( @xmath52 ) with initially unexcited ( @xmath53 ) or excited ( @xmath54 ) atom , one obtains @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the scaled time , @xmath57 is the scaled rabi frequency corresponding to each subspace , and @xmath58 is the photon - number distribution . for the initial coherent state , @xmath59 is the poissonian distribution and @xmath60 is the initial mean photon number .",
    "then , due to the property of this distribution , the most regular dynamics occurs for large values of the initial mean photon number @xmath61 .",
    "contributions corresponding to different @xmath62 s interfere in such a manner that they initially go out of phase , after that acquire a common phase , and this process is repeated resulting in a series of collapses and revivals , as shown in fig .  [",
    "the revival time @xmath63 can be estimated using the condition @xcite @xmath64 which gives @xmath65 .",
    "one should expect a similar behavior also for the dicke model in the strong - field domain @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "of course , the collapses and revivals related to the photon - number distribution would be modified by the collective atomic effects due to the fact that the eigenvalues of the interaction hamiltonian are not equidistant . in the strong - field limit",
    "@xmath67 the anharmonic corrections to the eigenvalues become small , and one should expect a quite regular behavior similar to that of the resonant jaynes - cummings model .",
    "however , we will see that there exist reasons for an irregular behavior that are much more important than just the anharmonicity of the eigenvalues .",
    "in fact , the initial atomic state determines how important will be various factors leading to irregularities in the behavior of the system .",
    "= 0.45    we first consider the cases with the atoms prepared initially in the fully - excited and ground states .",
    "the temporal behavior of the atomic inversion @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "[ cr1](b , c ) for the case of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with atoms prepared in ( b ) the fully - excited state @xmath44 and ( c ) the ground state @xmath45 .",
    "the first feature to note is the dependence of the revival time on the initial atomic state .",
    "similarly to the jaynes - cummings model , we can estimate the revival time for the initial atomic state @xmath13 as @xmath70 where we use the strong - field limit expression for the rabi frequency ( i.e. , neglect the anharmonic corrections to the eigenvalues ) .",
    "formula ( [ taur ] ) is in a good agreement with our numerical results , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "the difference between the revival times for the fully - excited state and the ground state is particularly obvious when @xmath0 is not too small compared to @xmath61 .",
    "the second feature is that the spread of the revivals is determined only by the photon statistics of the initial field state @xcite and does not depend on the value of @xmath71 .",
    "these two observations may explain why the temporal behavior loses its regularity for the initial ground state notably faster than for the initial fully - excited state .",
    "indeed , we see in fig .",
    "[ cr1](b ) four regular revivals for @xmath72 , while in fig .",
    "[ cr1](c ) for @xmath73 the behavior starts to be irregular already at the end of the third revival .",
    "the reason is that the spread of the revivals increases with time and neighboring revivals start to overlap , which leads to the loss of regularity . since for @xmath73",
    "the revival time is shorter than for @xmath72 , the overlapping of the revivals and the corresponding irregularity occur earlier .",
    "= 0.45    another factor that leads to differences between the behavior of the system in the cases @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the dependence of the anharmonic corrections to the eigenvalues on the value of @xmath71 . in order to give a representative example , we considered the eigenvalues @xmath74 of the interaction hamiltonian for the subspaces with @xmath48 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the ratio @xmath78 of the 5th and 1st eigenvalues was chosen as a parameter representing the anharmonicity ( for equidistant eigenvalues @xmath79 is exactly @xmath80 ) .",
    "the numerical results are listed in table [ t1 ] .",
    "we see that for given @xmath0 the value of @xmath79 increases with decrease of @xmath71 , i.e. , irregular effects related to the anharmonicity are most important for @xmath73 . for @xmath72",
    "the value of @xmath79 decreases slightly with increase of @xmath0 , but the overall contribution of the anharmonic corrections increases with @xmath0 just because there are more eigenvalues . for @xmath73 the value of @xmath79 increases with @xmath0 ,",
    "so the importance of the anharmonic corrections here increases with @xmath0 much faster than for @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , we see that the amplitude of the revivals for @xmath73 is smaller than for @xmath72 , and this effect becomes more pronounced as @xmath0 increases . for @xmath69 , as @xmath0 increases from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , the relative amplitude @xmath83 ( the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath49 in the first revival , divided by @xmath0 ) decreases from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for @xmath72 and from @xmath86 to @xmath87 for @xmath73 .",
    "this effect occurs because the anharmonic corrections partially destroy the interference of the oscillating terms .",
    "of course , as the initial mean photon number @xmath61 increases , the behavior of the system becomes more regular .",
    "now we turn to the case when the atoms are prepared in the half - excited dicke state @xmath46 ( for even values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the temporal behavior of the atomic inversion @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "[ cr3 ] for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . here",
    "we see a number of interesting phenomena .",
    "first of all , the amplitude of the rabi oscillations is significantly suppressed . for @xmath69 , as @xmath0 increases from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , the relative amplitude @xmath90 ( the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath49 in the very beginning of the evolution , divided by @xmath0 ) increases linearly from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , according to the empirical formula @xmath93 for comparison , @xmath90 is about @xmath94 for @xmath72 and about @xmath95 for @xmath73 , being almost independent of @xmath0 .",
    "= 0.45    another important feature is the appearance of half - time revivals , i.e. , for @xmath96 the revival time is actually @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , tiny half - time revivals appear also for @xmath98 , but their amplitudes are much smaller than the amplitudes of the first revivals at @xmath63 . as @xmath0 increases from @xmath81 to @xmath82 , the relative amplitude @xmath99 ( the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath49 in the half - time revival , divided by @xmath0 ) increases monotonically from @xmath100 to @xmath101 for @xmath72 and from @xmath102 to @xmath103 for @xmath73 .",

    "for @xmath109 we even find @xmath110 .",
    "in contradistinction to the cases @xmath98 , for @xmath96 the ratio @xmath104 decreases from @xmath111 to @xmath112 as @xmath0 increases from @xmath81 to @xmath82 . in this range of @xmath0 the relative amplitude @xmath99",
    "of the half - time revival increases slightly from 0.0037 to 0.0052 , while the relative amplitude @xmath83 of the first revival increases much faster : from @xmath113 to @xmath114 . starting from @xmath115 the amplitude of the first revival exceeds that of the initial oscillations .",
    "the ratio @xmath116 increases almost linearly from @xmath117 to @xmath118 as @xmath0 increases from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "the value @xmath119 of the atomic inversion during the collapse is always positive for @xmath98 .",

    "the value of @xmath119 is always negative and decreases from @xmath123 to @xmath124 in the same range of @xmath0 .",

    "we also see that in general the dynamics in the case @xmath96 is much more irregular than for @xmath98 .",
    "all these observations show that the structure of the phenomenon of collapses and revivals is essentially different for the half - excited dicke state relative to the fully - excited state or the ground state . inspecting the eigenvalues ( see table [ t1 ] ) , we see that the influence of the anharmonic corrections can not explain this principal difference . as expected , the behavior becomes more regular with increase of the mean photon number @xmath61 .",
    "for odd numbers of atoms the half - excited dicke state @xmath46 does not exist .",
    "however , for sufficiently large odd values of @xmath0 the dicke state @xmath131 exhibits properties very similar to those of the half - excited state .    in order to explain the peculiar phenomena discussed above",

    "\\label{popinv0}\\ ] ] now it is clear why the oscillations are strongly suppressed for @xmath96 . here",
    "both the constant and oscillatory terms have the prefactor @xmath137 , while for @xmath98 in addition to the constant and oscillatory terms with prefactors of the order @xmath138 there exists an oscillatory term with a prefactor of the order @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath69 the suppression is by two orders of magnitude . for @xmath96",

    "@xmath98 the leading oscillatory term with the prefactor of the order @xmath58 has the frequency @xmath141 , associated with the revival time @xmath63 , while the smaller oscillatory term with the prefactor of the order @xmath138 has the double frequency , leading to the half - time revivals .",
    "this explains why for @xmath98 the half - time revival is much smaller than the first revival while for @xmath96 both types of revivals are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the more irregular dynamics in the case @xmath96 can be explained by two reasons .",
    "first , the nonlinearity of the rabi frequency ( @xmath142 ) is less important for larger values of @xmath62 , so the dynamics is more regular when the main contribution comes from larger @xmath62 s . for @xmath98",
    "the prefactors of the leading terms are poissonian , so for large enough @xmath61 , the main contribution will come from the high - frequency terms , resulting in a regular behavior",
    ". however , for @xmath96 the prefactors are @xmath137 , so lower frequencies also contribute , which results in a less regular behavior .",
    "the second reason is that the revivals start to overlap much earlier if the revival time is halved . the same reason also leads to an additional irregularity in the case @xmath73 when the number of atoms is relatively large and the half - time revivals are not too small .",
    "the suppression of the revival amplitude for the half - excited dicke state is similar to the trapping phenomenon which occurs for a single atom prepared in the equally weighted superposition state @xmath143 ( see ref .",

    "the remaining oscillating term has the prefactor of the order @xmath138 , so the amplitude of the rabi oscillations is reduced by the factor of the order @xmath146 . as explained above , in such a situation",
    "the dynamics is less regular than for the case of initially unexcited or fully excited atom .",
    "however , the revival time is not halfed for the single atom in the equally weighted superposition state . in the single - atom case",
    "the population trapping occurs due to the destructive interference between the contributions of the two levels , while for the two - atom half - excited dicke state this phenomenon can be explained by the destructive interference between the contributions of the two correlated atoms .",
    "the coherent radiation field interacting with atoms can acquire interesting nonclassical properties such as sub - poissonian photon statistics and squeezing . in the present paper we focus on the important quantum phenomenon of squeezing .",
    "the initially coherent cavity field can be squeezed when it interacts with a single atom @xcite , and squeezing in the revival - time regime can be very strong for large intensities of the field @xcite .",
    "butler and drummond discovered @xcite that in the dicke model collective atomic effects can improve squeezing obtained for short interaction times , compared to the single - atom case . squeezing in the dicke model",
