    "observations on supernova type ia @xcite , cosmic microwave background @xcite and large scale structure @xcite , all indicate that the expansion of the universe is not proceeding as predicted by general relativity , if the universe is homogeneous , spatially flat , and filled with relativistic matter . an interesting approach to explain the positive acceleration of the universe is @xmath0 theories of gravity which generalize the geometrical part of hilbert - einstein lagrangian @xcite .",
    "one of the initiative @xmath0 models supposed to explain the positive acceleration of expanding universe has @xmath0 action as @xmath4 @xcite . after proposing the @xmath4 model",
    ", it was appeared this model suffer several problems . in the metric formalism , initially dolgov and kawasaki discovered the violent instability in the matter sector @xcite .",
    "the analysis of this instability generalized to arbitrary @xmath0 models @xcite and it was shown than an @xmath0 model is stable if @xmath5 and unstable if @xmath6",
    ". thus we can deduce @xmath7 suffer the dolgov - kawasaki instability but this instability removes in the @xmath8 model , where @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , one can see in the @xmath7 model the cosmology is inconsistent with observation when non - relativistic matter is present .",
    "in fact there is no matter dominant era @xcite .",
    "however , the recent study shows the standard epoch of matter domination can be obtained in the @xmath8 model @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that a viable theory of gravity must have the correct newtonian limit . indeed",
    "a viable theory of @xmath0 gravity must pass solar system tests .",
    "after the @xmath7 was suggested as the solution of cosmic - acceleration puzzle , it has been argued that this theory is inconsistent with solar system tests @xcite .",
    "this claim was based on the fact that metric @xmath0 gravity is equivalent to @xmath10 brans - dicke theory , while the observational constraint is @xmath11 .",
    "but this is not quite the case and it is possible to investigate the spherical symmetric solutions of @xmath0 gravity without invoking the equivalence of @xmath0 gravity and scalar tensor theory @xcite . it has been shown that some @xmath0 models accept the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time as a spherical symmetric solutions of field equation@xcite . hence @xmath7 model has a schwarzschild - de sitter solution with constant curvature as @xmath12 where this is not the case in @xmath8 model .    in this paper we study the @xmath2 model of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we find the static spherically symmetric solution of vacuum field equation in both weak field limit and strong gravity regime , moreover , the weak field analysis can be expanded on @xmath0 models of the form @xmath13 .",
    "in this section we investigate the weak field solution of vacuum field equation in @xmath0 theories of gravity .",
    "we are interested in model of the form @xmath13 , with @xmath14 an adjustable small parameter .",
    "the motivation for discussing these models is that the nonlinear curvature terms that grow at low curvature can lead to the late time positive acceleration , but during the standard matter dominated epoch , where the curvature is assumed to be relatively high , could have a negligible effect .",
    "the field equations for these models are @xmath15\\varphi(r)+kt_{\\mu \\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .",
    "contracting the field equation we obtain @xmath17\\varphi(r)-kt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for the vacuum @xmath18 . if @xmath19 the above equations reduce to einstein equation .",
    "hence we suppose @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the r.h.s of eqs.([eq1],[eq2 ] ) can be neglected for small values of @xmath14 . furthermore if the condition @xmath22 = 0 $ ]",
    "is satisfied we can neglect this term too .",
    "neglecting these terms leads to the following equations @xmath23\\varphi(r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath24 the analysis of spherically symmetric solution can be carried out using schwarzschild coordinate @xmath25 in the weak field limit approximation the metric deviates slightly from the minkowski metric , so we can write @xmath26 when solving the field equations([eq3],[eq4 ] ) we will keep only terms linear in the perturbations @xmath27 , @xmath28 . hence equations ( [ eq3],[eq4 ] ) leads to @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates a derivation with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "this model is considered in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that this model has an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution and regarding the general line - element in eq.([eq5 ] ) , it may be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant . in the limit @xmath36 , these solutions become @xmath37 because we seek the weak field limit , in above equation we assume @xmath38 .",
    "since we are interested in the limit @xmath39 , we may expand @xmath33 around @xmath40 .",
    "then we have @xmath41 it is clear that @xmath42 satisfies the condition @xmath43= 0.\\ ] ] inserting @xmath44 in the trace equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , the ricci scalar is obtained as @xmath45 then we arrive at the solutions of eq.([eq7 ] ) @xmath46 where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "we can see our solutions are in agreement with the exact solutions ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "also one can check neglecting @xmath21 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in eq.([eq1 ] , [ eq2 ] ) is reasonable .      for this model @xmath50 .",
    "solving trace equation ( [ eq8 ] ) and field equations ( [ eq7 ] ) we obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant .",
    "therefore the space time metric for empty space in this model is @xmath54 we can see , the generalized newtonian potential is @xmath55 this generalized gravitational potential has two terms .",
    "the first term is the standard newtonian potential and the second term make a constant acceleration , @xmath56 , which is independent of the mass of star . in @xcite this metric is used to address the pioneer s anomalous .",
    "based on equivalence between @xmath0 gravity and brans - dicke theory with @xmath10 , it was argued that this theory is inconsistent with solar system tests @xcite . indeed by this approach the post - newtonian parameter is found as @xmath58 while the measurements indicate @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "also we must note that using equivalence between @xmath0 gravity and scalar tensor gravity one can find models which are consistent with the solar system tests",
    ". this consistency can be made by giving the scalar a high mass or exploiting the so - called chameleon effect@xcite .",
    "however , when one is using equivalence between @xmath0 gravity and scalar tensor gravity , the continuity of scalar field or its equivalent , the ricci scalar , at the matter boundary is crucial condition which is not the case in einstein gravity .",
    "but in this work we do nt adopt the continuity of ricci scalar for solving the field equations .",
    "instead , we suppose that when @xmath60 tends to zero we arrive at the einstein gravity .",
    "thus we find a solution for @xmath61 model which is radically different from other solutions in @xcite .",
    "for this model we have @xmath62 where @xmath42 fulfills the condition @xmath63 = 0 $ ] . solving eqs.([eq7],[eq8 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath53 is a constant .",
    "therefore the metric for space time is @xmath66 * we can use the isotropic form , by introducing a new radius , @xmath67 , which defined as @xmath68 and therefore the equivalent metric can be read as @xmath69 from above metric one can see in the asymptotic behavior,@xmath70 , @xmath71 can be obtained .",
    "* + from eq.([eq13 ] ) it is obvious that in the limit @xmath70 , @xmath72 tends to zero , so there is not singularity in the field equations .",
    "also one can check neglecting @xmath21 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 in eq.([eq1 ] , [ eq2 ] ) is reasonable .      in this section",
    "we discuss the interior gravitational field in the spherically symmetric case of static mass distribution in the @xmath73 model where @xmath3 .",
    "so we seek a spherically symmetric , static solution and we adopt the metric([eq5 ] ) . in this model",
    "we may rewrite field equation ( [ eq1 ] ) and trace equation ( [ eq2 ] ) as @xmath74 from eq.([eq2 ] ) it is obvious that as @xmath70 , @xmath75 , so assuming @xmath76 , in the r.h.s of eq.([mix1 ] ) we may neglect those terms that contain @xmath72",
    ". thus field equations ( [ mix1 ] ) reduce to einstein equations hence we may write @xmath77 furthermore the conservation equation , @xmath78 , leads to @xmath79 where @xmath80 are pressure and density of matter . to obtain metric components",
    "@xmath81 , we use eq.([mix3 ] ) and @xmath82 and @xmath83 components of eq.([mix2 ] ) @xmath84 solving eq.([mix4 ] ) we may write @xmath85    from continuity of the metric component b(r ) , on the boundary surface @xmath86 we find @xmath87 where in the above equation we used the empty space solution eq.([eq14 ] ) . from the above equation we may determine the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "it is seen that in the @xmath3 limit this constant reduces to the schwarzschild radius .",
    "furthermore , according to cosmological studies @xmath88 @xcite so , regarding a typical solar system , in eq.([mix6 ] ) we may neglect terms at order @xmath89 .    from equation ( [ mix6 ] )",
    "it is obvious that the physical interpretation of the parameter @xmath53 differ from that of general relativity . also from the above equation it is clear that in the @xmath61 gravity the external solution depends on the shape of matter distribution .",
    "in this section we investigate the existence of strong gravitational field for @xmath90 model of @xmath0 gravity .",

    "we can rewrite eq.([eq21 ] ) as    [ eq23 ] @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110    where ( @xmath94 ) denotes derivation with respect to the ( @xmath101 ) . for the limit @xmath3 , in the above equations we suppose that we can neglect terms containing @xmath111 . after solving equations we check this assumption . by neglecting these terms , equations [ eq23 ]",

    "now we can check the validity of our assumption .",
    "considering the solutions ( [ eq26 ] ) , shows that neglecting terms containing @xmath111 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) is valid only for @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "hence the metric ( [ eq25 ] ) is solution of field equations in the range of @xmath122 . by performing a conformal transformation and changing",
    "coordinate we can see the strong field solution ( [ eq27 ] ) is @xmath123 which is valid in the range of @xmath124 and farther where @xmath125 , the metric of space time can be approximated by the metric ( [ eq22 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we have solved field equations ( [ eq23])numerically and presented the results in figures [ fig : f1 ] , [ fig : f2 ] , and [ fig : f3 ] .",
    "the plots show that the numerical results are in agreement with the analytical solutions ( [ eq25],[eq26 ] ) in their region of validity .",
    "we studied spherically symmetric solution of @xmath0 gravity . at first a new approach for investigating the weak field limit of vacuum field equations in @xmath0 gravity",
    "was introduced .",
    "our results for the weak field limit of some studied f(r ) models are in agreement with their known solutions .",
    "we solved the field equations for @xmath1 gravity at weak field limit and obtained a solution which differs slightly from the schwarzschild metric .",
    "our results are against the arguments that @xmath0 models are ill defined because of the equivalence of @xmath0 gravity and brans - dicke gravity with @xmath126 which leads to @xmath58 .",
    "in fact our results are in agreement with the recent article of capozziello et al .",
    "@xcite , in which they have studied newtonian limit of the @xmath0 gravity by considering that fourth order gravity models are dynamically equivalent to the ohanlon lagrangian and they have shown fourth order gravity models can not be ruled out only on the base of analogy with brans - dicke gravity with @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , regarding the results for the weak field limit , we investigated the strong field regime for this model and showed that if @xmath127 , where @xmath32 and @xmath128 are radius and schwarzschild radius in the schwarzschild coordinate respectively , the gravitational field is a perturbed schwarzschild metric even in strong gravity regime .",
    "finally we solved the master equations numerically by setting the initial value conditions using the analytical answers of the strong gravity region . in figures ( [ fig : f1 ] ) and ( [ fig : f2 ] ) we plotted the analytical and numerical solutions of the components of the metric , @xmath100 and @xmath104 , versus radius in two weak and strong gravity region .",
    "it is seen that in the strong region ( the close up part ) the relevant analytical answer and the numerical solution are agree together while the analytical weak field approximation solution deviates from the numerical solution .",
    "the close up part of figures show that with increasing the radius and going to the weak filed region , the analytical solutions of strong filed approximation and numerical answers get separated from each other , and at last in the weak field region , i.e. @xmath129 , the analytical weak field answers coincide with the numerical solution , while the answers for the strong gravity region has a grate deviation from the numerical results in this region .",
