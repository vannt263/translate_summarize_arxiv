    "transport phenomena are well known in the physical world .",
    "diffusion has received special attention by the scientific community .",
    "more specifically , diffusion of particles with presence of constraints has been intensely studied @xcite . in this respect",
    ", several works showed that particles moving under some kind of spatial restriction may exhibit anomalous diffusion @xcite ; depending on the nature of the confinement , it can happen that mutual passage among particles is forbidden , resulting in a phenomenon called single file diffusion ( sfd ) .",
    "some realizations of sfd include transport of water and ions through molecular - sized channels in biological membranes @xcite , diffusion of colloids in microfluidic devices @xcite , molecular transport in zeolites @xcite and passage of molecules through narrow pores @xcite , being this latter the first approach about sfd mechanism .",
    "systems of particles limited to move in confined environments ( or submitted to an adjoining external field ) display a different dynamics from one expected for free particles @xcite .",
    "in addition to confinement , the interparticle interaction also plays a relevant role in the description of this diffusion process @xcite , with the possibility of letting the diffusion even slower than in the sfd case @xcite . + the most common way , which by no means cover all cases , of characterizing a diffusion process is through the long - time limit of the mean square displacement ( msd ) , @xmath0 , which is : @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the effective diffusion coefficient and @xmath3 the diffusive exponent , which allows us to sort the diffusion process as normal ( @xmath4 ) , superdiffusion ( @xmath5 ) or subdiffusion ( @xmath6 ) ; if @xmath7 , we have ballistic diffusion , and if @xmath8 , we have a characteristic behavior of sfd ( however not deterministic ) .",
    "some theoretical works have related crossover occurrences from normal to subdiffusion ( including sfd @xcite ) and between normal diffusion and ballistic one @xcite .",
    "+ lately , a novel type of model particles , called self - propelled or active matter @xcite have been proposed , which are so - called due to the fact that they propel themselves through some internal mechanism .",
    "recently , there has been an increasing interest in the transport properties of self - propelled particles @xcite , more specifically , with diffusion in confined geometries @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite have studied the confinement effect in a pure one - dimensional active particle system , and the consequent change in the system dynamics , specially in the diffusion regimes @xcite . in this letter , we study the diffusion regimes , in the @xmath9 direction , of a system of active particles , confined by a parabolic potential in the perpendicular , i. .e @xmath10 , direction , as a function of the confinement strength and rotational noise intensity .",
    "we are mainly interested in measuring the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) of the active particles , @xmath11 ^ 2\\right\\rangle , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] in the perpendicular direction , and obtaining the diffusion , given by @xmath3 in ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the results show that increasing the confinement and angular noise strengths , we go from superdiffusion ( even ballistic in some cases ) to subdiffusion ( practically attaining the sfd regime ) .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the model employed in the simulations as well as the method used for integrating the equations of motion . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we show our main results for the msd curves along with additional data to support our observations .",
    "lastly , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "in our simulations , we employed the angular brownian motion ( abm ) @xcite model in a two - dimensional system of @xmath12 particles .",
    "initially they are randomly distributed in the simulation box , and have random velocity directions .",
    "the dynamics of the _ i_-th particle is given by the langevin equation in the limit of low reynolds number ( overdamped regime ) @xmath13 these equations are integrated via the stochastic second - order runge - kutta method ( rksii ) @xcite , in which @xmath14 is the vector position of each particle , @xmath15 sets the direction of the vector @xmath16 $ ] along the intrinsic motion , being @xmath17 the magnitude of the self - propulsion .",
    "the gaussian white noises @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the thermal noise , from ordinary brownian motion , and random torque ( due to some inner mechanism of the particles ) responsible for changing the internal motion direction , respectively .",
    "they have zero means and correlations given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 with intensities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24,@xmath25 = @xmath26 , and @xmath27,@xmath28 = @xmath9,@xmath10 .",
    "the term @xmath29 is the net force on the particle @xmath24 , and @xmath30 , if @xmath31 ( @xmath32 otherwise ) , is the interparticle interaction , with @xmath33 being the overlap distance between particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 of diameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . in our model",
    "all particles have the same size , then @xmath36 .",
    "the system is subject to an external force @xmath37 which acts only in @xmath10 and is calculated from the harmonic potential @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the confinement strength and @xmath40 the minimum of the potential .",
    "the particles move in a space of dimensions @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 with boundary periodic conditions in @xmath9 . in @xmath10",
    "there is no boundary ( the potential keeps the particles in a finite space ) .",
    "this choice for boundary in @xmath10 yields an effective area fraction of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a function of @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , as we will see next , the confinement keeps the particles spread out in a more narrow strip , compared to @xmath46 , around @xmath40 .",
    "the values of the fixed parameters used are : self - speed magnitude @xmath47 ( which sets the time unit ) , particle diameter @xmath48 ( which sets the length unit ) , @xmath49 , interparticle repulsion stiffness @xmath50 , time step @xmath51 , external potential minimum , @xmath52 , and translational noise intensity , @xmath53 . with this choice for @xmath22",
    ", we follow @xcite , and neglect thermal fluctuations , since we are interested only in the effects of the active degree of freedom .",
    "the study of ordinary brownian particles in confinement was reported in @xcite .",
    "each simulation is repeated 5 times ; averages are taken over the number of runs , and time , where appropriate .",
    "in this section , we present our results for msd curves , along with other data that will help us to explain our observations .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show all msd curves vs. time for all @xmath39 and @xmath23 values ; in fig . [ fig2 ] , we show the mean exponent of each curve , with additional points that were measured for curves that are omitted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; these exponents were obtained through power law fits of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in the long time limit , i.e , we only considered for these fits parts of those curves in which we have , at least , time@xmath54 .",
    "a feature readily seen is that , for a fixed @xmath39 , the exponent @xmath3 decreases with increasing @xmath23 : for @xmath55 , fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , we go from ballistic ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath56 to normal diffusion ( @xmath4 ) for @xmath57 , even reaching subdiffusion at @xmath58 ; while for higher @xmath39 , we begin at superdiffusion in all cases ( in particular , @xmath3 is slightly larger than 1 for @xmath59 ) for @xmath60 and then the subdiffusive regime is attained ( @xmath8 , the sfd value ) at @xmath58 . + the appearance of subdiffusive regimes is simply a consequence of a more restricted space ( i.e , denser system ) in @xmath10 , for particles to explore , as we will show below . as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , this compaction effect takes place either as we increase @xmath39 or @xmath23 .",
    "the effect of the confinement magnitude @xmath39 on the spreading of the particles around @xmath40 is obvious ( a larger confinement strength results in a system more compacted around @xmath61 ) , and an estimate of the width of the region in which the particles are distributed around the potential minimum can be obtained by equating the external force @xmath62 to the active force @xmath63 and solving for @xmath64 ( which is half the size of the region around @xmath40 ) .",
    "the calculation yields for @xmath64 the following @xmath65 hence , a larger @xmath39 implies a more confined ( compacted ) space for particles to move .",
    "the role of @xmath23 on the spatial restriction is not as obvious as the effect of @xmath39 ; however , we may understand it as a consequence of the fact that active particles with a lower @xmath23 have a larger probability to keep moving along a given direction for a longer time than those with larger @xmath23 ( longer persistent motion ) .",
    "therefore , particles with a lower @xmath23 are able to climb the potential barrier further than those with larger @xmath23 , rendering a less compact system .",
    "this effect is more readily seen at low @xmath39 .     as a function of @xmath23.[fig2 ] ]    the effects of @xmath39 and @xmath23 just we have described do not explain the unexpected normal and superdiffusive regimes at high confinement ; clearly something else should be occurring , which is controlled by these two parameters .",
    "+ in order to understand this behavior , we measured the probability distribution of particles along @xmath10 , @xmath66 ; we show a few of such curves in fig.[fig3 ] .    for fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ( @xmath55 , @xmath58 ) , we see partly the picture described above ; particles remain close to @xmath40 ( the minimum of the potential ) , rendering a denser system and a slower diffusion when @xmath23 is large , while they spread out significantly around @xmath40 for low noise and confinement strength ( see fig .",
    "3b , @xmath55 , @xmath60 ) . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig3]a with [ fig3]c ( @xmath59 , @xmath58 ) and [ fig3]b with [ fig3]d ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) , we see the effect of @xmath39 compacting the system ; in both cases , the width of @xmath66 decreases . in general , the effect of either increasing @xmath39 or @xmath23 is to compact the system , as explained above , and is reflected in all @xmath66 curves that we measured . finally , the double peak seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b does not appear for @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "note that these two peaks are not independent , and we can not , at this point , interpret this result as evidence of the well - known transition from single file to double file in passive systems @xcite , occurring in this context .",
    "we leave this problem to study in a future work . + comparing figs .",
    "[ fig3]c and [ fig3]d , we do not see any significant change in @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath59 this probability hardly changes with @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , we have sub ( practically the sfd regime ) and superdiffusion for @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , figs .",
    "[ fig3]c and [ fig3]d , respectively .",
    "in order to understand what is going on in this high confinement regime , we show two snapshots of the steady state of the system in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for the parameters in figs .",
    "[ fig3]c , and [ fig3]d .",
    "+ now , the situation becomes clearer : at high @xmath39 , and low @xmath23 , there is an aggregation effect taking place , while these structures seem to be absent at high @xmath23 .",
    "in this high @xmath39 , low @xmath23 regime , the particles can not climb the potential barrier , as previously seen ; they , instead , stay around @xmath40 , and form clusters , as a consequence of their longer persistent motion .",
    "therefore , we see that super and normal diffusion seen at high @xmath39 is the result of the available space that is left among clusters which allows them to diffuse more swiftly than at the ( apparently ) sfd picture seen at fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , ( a similar effect was reported for magnetic brownian particles in confinement @xcite in which attractive interactions were responsible for the aggregation ) . in the next section",
    ", we study these clusters a little further so that we can to understand their role in the system .      here",
    ", we show our results concerning the average cluster size @xmath71 , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , as a function of @xmath39 and @xmath23 .",
    "we considered that two particles form a cluster if their distance is @xmath72 . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we see that for @xmath55 there are only small clusters , since @xmath71 is about 3 for any noise strength , and it is fairly insensitive to variations in @xmath23 . for the other confinement strengths , we see the same qualitative dependence on @xmath23 : it grows with decreasing noise intensity . for @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", we have @xmath73 , which means a discernible local structure ( with only a handful of clusters at any time , since @xmath74 is fixed ) . by itself",
    ", these results only imply the existence of these aggregates , and do not mean more available space for diffusion ; nevertheless , we see that as we increase @xmath39 , a larger diffusion exponent is obtained where we have few , large clusters . + in order to understand the change in the structure of the system , we computed the radial distribution function , @xmath75 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a , we can see a sequence of peaks around @xmath76 .",
    "this is only possible if particles are arranged in a line , which gives additional support for sfd behavior seen at @xmath77 for @xmath58 ( in fact , @xmath75 for these three cases are similar to each other ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b , these peaks are absent , and there is no evidence of long range structure ; however , we see a high and wide peak around @xmath78 , what means a strong overlap among particles , which it turns out to be the signature , in the structure , of the clusters seen in fig .",
    "given the size and location of the first peak , we may infer that there should be a significant amount of empty space among the clusters .",
    "this is reflected in the structure of the system in that the rdf quickly decreases below its normalization value for @xmath79 .",
    "it should be stressed that such strong overlaps are a consequence of the weak interparticle repulsion , i.e , small stiffness , @xmath80 .",
    "although we did not investigate whether there is significant , if any , mutual passage ( what characterizes the sfd ) , we may speculate that particles with higher @xmath80 will overlap less and , therefore , occupy the empty space which is seen in figs .",
    "[ fig4]a and [ fig6]b .",
    "since the empty space among the clusters is what allows the normal and superdiffusion to occur , we may speculate that in hard sphere limit ( @xmath81 ) we will only observe sfd for strong confinement .",
    "we studied in this letter the diffusive properties of an active matter system confined laterally by a harmonic potential .",
    "we measured the mean square displacement ( msd ) in the @xmath9-direction for several confinement , @xmath39 , and noise , @xmath23 , strengths .",
    "+ the diffusion curves showed an inverse dependence between @xmath3 , the diffusion exponent , and @xmath23 for a given @xmath39 .",
    "we showed that the subdiffusive regimes arise due to compaction of the system when we increase @xmath39 and @xmath23 .",
    "our data for the radial distribution function at high @xmath39 gave us evidence that the msd curve with a diffusion exponent of @xmath8 accounts for a linear chain of particles as seen by the secondary peaks at integer distances , yielding a strong evidence for a sfd regime .",
    "+ on the other hand , we observe normal and superdiffusion at all @xmath39 , for low @xmath23 . for low confinement , particles span a wide stripe around @xmath40 , the potential minimum , which renders an effective dilute system . for high @xmath39 , we observed that particles form clusters , leaving a significant amount of empty space among them , allowing a faster diffusion . in both cases ,",
    "these effects occur due to longer persistent motion of the particles .",
    "we inferred the second fact from snapshots of the system configuration , along with the data for @xmath75 which show a high and wide first peak about @xmath78 at high @xmath39 and low @xmath23 .",
    "the strong overlap among particles , which is the signature of the clusters , is due to weak mutual repulsion , low @xmath80 . for harder particles",
    ", we may speculate that the clusters will disappear , and only subdiffusion ( although not necessarily sfd ) , at high @xmath39 , will take place .",
