    "qcd is thought to be the basic theory describing the interaction between quarks and gluons .",
    "unfortunately , until now , because of numerical reasons , this can only be checked in systems containing 2 or 3 quarks . therefore to make the theory more useful , methods are needed that are much less numerical intensive than lattice monte carlo .",
    "these methods should agree with the monte carlo approach for the few quark systems  the assumption being that their natural extension to multiquark systems would also give correct results . since many of the multiquark systems of interest are derived from hadron - hadron scattering , in which different quark clusters scatter and rearrange , it is the @xmath8 system that must be first understood . therefore , in several attempts to describe meson - meson scatterings from qcd , the resonating group method in which a meson is treated as a @xmath9 cluster is a promising approach . in i=2 @xmath10 and",
    "i=1 @xmath11 scattering the amplitude is dominated by the direct gluon and quark exchange , and the quark - pair annihilation is expected to play a minor role .",
    "therefore , as a first step , the detailed analysis of quark exchange processes from first principles or from lattice qcd is desirable . in a series of papers on the four - quark energies in su(2 ) lattice monte carlo@xcite , we considered configurations of two static @xmath12 clusters , which we called basis a and the quark interchanged two @xmath9 state basis b. we then analyzed the energy spectra in a framework similar to the resonating group method using the corresponding @xmath0 bases .",
    "it was observed that the transition potential @xmath13 connecting the bases needed to be multiplied by a factor @xmath2 - that can be interpreted as a gluon field overlap factor - in order that the solution of the matrix equation in this model coincided with the two lowest eigen energies of the monte carlo calculation .",
    "recently the configurations of the four - quark system were extended to include large square(ls ) , rectangular(r ) , tilted rectangle(tr ) , linear(l ) , quadrilateral(q ) and nonplanar(np ) geometries@xcite .",
    "an analysis similar to the @xcite showed that , except for the np case , the gluon overlap factor @xmath14 derived from the ground state energy and the @xmath15 derived from the first excited state are close to each other , but not identical . in the np case , the agreement was worse .    for simplicity of the model , we expect theoretically @xmath16 and we tentatively attribute the small difference in @xmath14 and @xmath15 as numerical uncertainties of the monte carlo calculation . in the np case , however , the analysis in terms of @xmath0 bases could , itself , be an origin of the difficulty .    in the su(2 )",
    "lattice monte carlo approach , the transition between different configurations occurs through multiplications of plaquettes , which characterize the gluon interaction , with the bases wave function . in the np case ,",
    "some plaquettes are 3-dimensional while in the other five cases they are purely 2-dimensional .",
    "a calculation of the glueball spectrum in lattice monte carlo shows that the 3-dimensional bent plaquette contains an irreducible representation of the cubic group which violates the space parity . in our case",
    "gluon configurations are pinned down by the position of the quarks and anti - quarks and the results of the glueball calculation can not be applied directly , but evenso we expect that the symmetry of the plaquettes , which makes the transition from basis a to b could play an important role .",
    "the factor @xmath2 comes from the flux - tube rearrangement . in the case of tr , q and np , the flux tubes of basis b are not straight lines on the underlying lattice but they are a superposition of the shortest paths along the links .",
    "the cubic symmetry of the plaquettes that transform the basis a to the basis b of tr and q have different irreducible representations of the cubic group , but in the np case , there are two plaquettes that belong to the same irreducible representation",
    ". the excited states of the np case could be the hybrids i.e. @xmath9 with gluonic excitations .",
    "we , therefore , consider two types of hybrids @xmath17 and @xmath18 and analyze the np data in a @xmath1 basis using a and @xmath19 .    in order to extract parameters for use in a resonating group calculation , the continuum limit , in which the cubic symmetry is replaced by the rotation symmetry , is to be considered .",
    "thus , parameters which are specific to the cubic symmetry are not desirable .",
    "we , therefore , parametrize the factor @xmath2 by a superposition of an area dependent term and a perimeter dependent term .",
    "when the area is not a plane surface , the area that we choose is not the sum of the area of the plaquettes but an approximate minimal surface that is bounded by the links .",
    "the perimeter is kept to be the length of links on the plaquette , since we want to respect the cubic symmetry which is essential for the parametrization .",
    "we check whether the parameters for different configurations like ls and r have a common parameter when the two configurations possess the same cubic symmetry .",
    "the success or failure of this approach is given by the degree to which the various configurations are described by the same parameters . since the gluon overlap factor is not a physical quantity , it could depend on the lattice size .",
    "we expect that the perimeter dependence decreases as the lattice size becomes larger and in the continuum limit the area term dominates .",
    "in sect.2 we present the model for fitting the data of the lattice monte carlo , and the numerical results are shown in sect.3 .",
    "finally in sect.4 some conclusions are drawn .",
    "in fitting the lattice monte carlo we could choose three model state bases@xcite .    * a : two links of equal length d that connect @xmath9 on 1 - 3 and on 2 - 4 .",
    "* b : two links that connect @xmath9 on 1 - 4 and on 2 - 3 , such that the number of bending points is a minimum .",
    "* c : two links that connect between @xmath20 and @xmath21 on 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 , such that the number of bending points is the minimum .",
    "this basis can be regarded as a baryon anti - baryon system in su(2 ) .",
    "as explained in the appendix of @xcite the three states are constructed by contracting the operator @xmath22 with tensors @xmath23    here , in su(2 ) , the quark field is described by @xmath24 and the antiquark field by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the colour flux path from z to x. due to the equation @xmath27 , the base c is equal to a ",
    "b if z can be chosen to be a common point of the paths of b. this is the case for linear(l ) , base @xmath28 of quadrilateral(q ) and base @xmath29 and @xmath30 of non - planar(np)(see figs .",

    ", a+c , b+c give very similar energy spectra@xcite .",

    "thus , in addition to the product of the spatial tiles , which can be obtained by taking @xmath70 , we take into account the transition between different @xmath64 bases which are proportional to the length of the perimeter .",
    "incorporation of the perimeter term via renormalization e.g. via the self energy given by the tadpole diagram is discussed also in the large n expansion@xcite .",

    "r + we fix @xmath62=0.296 and obtain @xmath217 which means @xmath218 .",
    "tr + we again fix @xmath62=0.296 and obtain @xmath219 . in order that the two mesons does not interact for large @xmath75",
    "it is necessary that @xmath220 .",
    "however , the negative value of @xmath184 does not cause trouble since the area term dominates in physically reasonable configurations and @xmath2 tends to 0 for large @xmath75 .",
    "l + we obtain @xmath221",
    "q + we fix e=0.296 and @xmath222 then we find @xmath223 which is close to the value @xmath217 obtained in r. this is a good indication that our parametrization is meaningful .",
    "when we use the perimeter @xmath224 which corresponds to the continuum limit , we obtain for @xmath225 and 4 , @xmath226 i.e. closer to @xmath157 .",
    "we insist , however , on using the @xmath5 that respects the cubic symmetry .",
    "np + in order to fit the parameters @xmath227 and @xmath228 of the np geometry we first fit @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath148 for each set of @xmath213 independently so that the three @xmath143 coincide with the three lowest eigenenergies . in the case of @xmath231 the unperturbed energy of the configuration b is lower than that of a and we found difficulty in fitting the data . in these cases",
    "one should consider @xmath232 and b as the basis , but since the flux tubes of the basis b are not along the lattice link it is not possible to specify the bases @xmath232 .",
    "we omit these data from the analysis , except @xmath233 , where the difference in the unperturbed energy is of the order of 0.05 and we can find parameters that fits the data approximately .",
    "+ we again fixed @xmath234 and @xmath222 , and searched parameters to fit the @xmath151 and @xmath152 of the data sets of @xmath213 that satisfy @xmath235 .",
    "we obtained @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 . @xmath207",
    "consistent with zero means that the coherence of the links on the twisted plaquette is weak .",
    "a fit with @xmath207 fixed to be zero gives @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "although the error - bar of @xmath195 is large it is consistent with the previous 1.63(72 ) .",
    "the coherence on the bent plaquette parametrized by @xmath117 is relatively stable .",
    "it is the main term that transforms among different symmetry states .",
    "we remark that @xmath117 in the np case and @xmath184 in the tr case are both related to the bent plaquette and the magnitudes are similar , while @xmath195 and @xmath157 are both related to the rectangular plaquette but the magnitude of @xmath195 is larger . in the latter case ,",
    "not all the 4-quarks are sitting on the plaquette @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "these plaquettes can be obtained by multiplying a plaquette to the base @xmath241 , and by multiplying a plaquette to the base @xmath242 , respectively , on which all the 4-quarks are sitting . since a link in the model bases contains a staple - shaped link , due to the fuzzing , the effective area and the length of the perimeter of the plaquette characterized by the parameter @xmath117 would be modified .",
    "we can not , however , estimate the correction and the parameter @xmath195 is regarded as a phenomenological parameter . + the parameter @xmath148 that connects the bases @xmath17 and @xmath18 should tend to 0 as r and d increase , and we observed this tendency in the fitting .",
    "but for simplicity , we search an average value of the parameter t that fits the three lowest eigenenergies of all the data of @xmath213 . taking @xmath243 and @xmath244 and the error - bars of the eigen - energies given by the lattice calculation data",
    ", we fitted t. due to relatively large error - bars in the highest energy state , we sacrifice the accuracy of the fit of the highest state .",
    "in fact in the highest state , more complicated configurations could be involved and the fitting with three bases could be a bad approximation .",
    "the value we obtained for @xmath148 is 0.045(10 ) .",
    "we analyzed the four - quark energies in su(2 ) calculated by lattice monte carlo in a model which is inspired by the resonating group calculation of hadron interactions .",
    "the transition matrix element between different bases a and b is assumed to be proportional to the gluon overlap factor and this factor is then parametrized by a product of an area dependent and a perimeter dependent term .",
    "the perimeter dependent term was introduced by considering transition between degenerate @xmath64 symmetric bases which in the large lattice or in the continuum limit would vanish except the self energy term . in the case of large square(ls ) , rectangular(r ) , tilted rectangular(tr ) , linear(l ) and quadrilateral(q ) configurations , we found reasonable parameters for the perimeter dependent term which are characterized by the cubic symmetry . in the non - planar(np ) case , we observed that it is necessary to take into acount the gluonic degrees of freedom explicitly .",
    "the base b was split into two hybrid configurations : @xmath17 and @xmath18 . using a and @xmath19 as the bases , we parametrized the gluon overlap factor for the np .",
    "we treated , the error - bars given by the lattice monte carlo as meaningful also for the small plaquettes and checked whether a consistent parametrization for different geometries is possible .",
    "we simulated the deviation from an area dependence by adding a perimeter dependent contribution .",
    "the parameters for the perimeter dependent part are @xmath245 and @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath246 in the q case is consistent with that of r case , and @xmath117 in the np case is consistent with @xmath184 in tr case .",
    "these coincidences are not trivial and are encouraging for any further analysis based on the cubic symmetry of the flux tube geometry .",
    "@xmath207 is consistent with 0 and we could well omit it",
    ". therefore , there are 5 parameters for the perimeter terms and one parameter for the area to fit the lattice monte carlo energy spectra .",
    "we expect that in the continuum limit @xmath2 is completely given by the area term except for the self energy contribution .",
    "a comparison of the data at @xmath170 and @xmath172 for the ls configuration suggests that the parameters of the perimeter term in fact decrease as the lattice constant @xmath40 becomes small . since the monte carlo data contain lattice artefacts , in order to analyze the data for a specific configuration we need to choose proper bases so that these artefacts are eliminated . since the artefacts are represented by the perimeter term , its cubic symmetry property is essential for choosing the proper bases .",
