    "heavy quarkonia , both @xmath16 and @xmath17 bound states , have provided good laboratories for the study of the strong interaction  @xcite . for the hadronic transitions between the heavy quarkonium states , yan  @xcite characterized it as the emission of two soft gluons from the heavy quarks and the conversion of gluons into light hadrons .",
    "based on this scheme , a series of decay rates , such as the e1-e1 hadronic transition , e1-m1 hadronic transition , m1-m1 hadronic transition have been calculated  @xcite . it has been shown that the multipole expansion can make quite successful predictions for many hadronic transitions between the heavy quarkonia  @xcite",
    ". however , most of these studies are for the transitions among the @xmath18 states ; the hadronic transitions of @xmath19 states are seldom explored . using a sample of @xmath20 , cleo measured for the first time the transition rate of @xmath21-wave bottomonium @xmath22  @xcite , and the results are consistent with the theoretical predictions  @xcite . for the hadronic transition of the @xmath21-wave charmonium states ,",
    "there is only an upper limit of 2.2% at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) on the @xmath23 transition rate recently reported by the babar experiment  @xcite .",
    "the most promising process @xmath24 , which is dominated by an e1-m1 transition , is calculated in the multipole expansion formalism , and a transition rate @xmath25% is predicted  @xcite .    in this article , we search for @xmath0 with @xmath4 decays into @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where the @xmath26 is reconstructed in @xmath27 and @xmath28 in @xmath29 final states .",
    "we also report the first measurement of the branching fractions of @xmath30 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the data sample for this analysis consists of @xmath2 events produced at the peak of the @xmath3 resonance  @xcite ; an additional 42  pb@xmath31 of data were collected at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath32=3.65  gev to determine non - resonant continuum background contributions .",
    "the data are accumulated with the besiii detector operated at the bepcii @xmath33 collider .    the besiii detector , described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , has an effective geometrical acceptance of 93% of 4@xmath34 .",
    "it contains a small cell helium - based main drift chamber ( mdc ) which provides momentum measurements of charged particles ; a time - of - flight system ( tof ) based on plastic scintillator which helps to identify charged particles ; an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) made of csi ( tl ) crystals which is used to measure the energies of photons and provide trigger signals ; and a muon system ( muc ) made of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) .",
    "the resolution of the charged particles is @xmath35% at @xmath36 in a 1  tesla magnetic field . the energy loss ( @xmath37 ) measurement provided by the mdc has a resolution better than 6% for electrons from bhabha scattering",
    ". the photon energy resolution can reach @xmath38% ( @xmath39% ) at @xmath40 in the barrel ( endcaps ) of the emc .",
    "and the time resolution of tof is @xmath41  ps in the barrel and @xmath42  ps in the endcaps .",
    "monte carlo  ( mc ) simulated events are used to determine the detection efficiency , optimize the selection criteria , and study the possible backgrounds .",
    "the simulation of the besiii detector is geant4  @xcite based , where the interactions of the particles with the detector material are simulated .",
    "the @xmath3 resonance is produced with kkmc  @xcite , while the subsequent decays are generated with evtgen  @xcite .",
    "the study of the background is based on a sample of @xmath43 @xmath3 inclusive decays which are generated with known branching fractions taken from the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , or with lundcharm  @xcite for the unmeasured decays .",
    "a charged track should have good quality in the track fitting and be within the angle coverage of the mdc , @xmath44 . a good charged track ( excludes those from @xmath26 decays )",
    "is required to be within 1  cm of the @xmath33 annihilation interaction point ( ip ) transverse to the beam line and within 10  cm of the ip along the beam axis .",
    "charged - particle identification ( pid ) is based on combining the @xmath37 and tof information in the variable @xmath45 .",
    "the values @xmath46 and the corresponding confidence levels @xmath47 are calculated for each charged track for each particle hypothesis @xmath48 ( pion , kaon , or proton ) .",
    "photons are reconstructed from isolated showers in the emc which are at least 20 degrees away from any of the charged tracks . in order to improve the reconstruction efficiency and the energy resolution ,",
    "the energy deposited in the nearby tof counter is included .",
    "photon candidates are required to have the energy greater than 25  @xmath49 in the emc barrel region ( @xmath50 ) , while in the emc endcap region ( @xmath51 ) , the energy threshold requirement is increased to 50  @xmath49 .",
    "emc timing requirements are used to suppress noise and energy deposits unrelated to the event .",
    "@xmath26 candidates are reconstructed from secondary vertex fits to all the charged - track pairs in an event ( assume the tracks to be @xmath34 ) .",
    "the combination with the best fit quality is kept , and the @xmath26 candidate must have an invariant mass within @xmath52 of the @xmath26 nominal mass and the secondary vertex be at least 0.5  cm away from the ip .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath26 information is used as input for the subsequent kinematic fit .",
    "the @xmath28 candidates are reconstructed from pairs of photons with an invariant mass in the range @xmath53 .    in selecting @xmath54 , a candidate event should have at least six charged tracks and at least one good photon .",
    "after @xmath26 selection , the event should have exactly four additional good charged tracks with zero net charge . while in selecting @xmath55 , a candidate event should have four good charged tracks with zero net charge and at least three good photons .",
    "the @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) candidate is then subjected to a four - constraint ( 4c ) kinematic fit to reduce background and improve the mass resolution .",
    "determination of the species of the final state particles and selection of the best photons when additional photons ( and @xmath28 candidates ) are found in an event are achieved by selecting the combination with the minimum value of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the chi - square from the 4c kinematic fit .",
    "events with @xmath60 are kept as @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) candidates .",
    "there is substantial background from @xmath61 decays .",
    "the @xmath62 events are removed by requiring the recoil mass of any @xmath27 pair to be outside of a @xmath63 window around the @xmath64 nominal mass , where @xmath65 is the resolution of the @xmath27 recoil mass .",
    "the @xmath66 , @xmath67 events are rejected if @xmath68 . to reject background with one more photon than the signal events ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 )",
    ", @xmath71 is required when a 4c kinematic fit to @xmath69 or @xmath70 is applied to the event ; and to suppress @xmath72 background , @xmath73 or @xmath74 is required .",
    "after the above selection , the invariant mass distributions of the hadron system are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : invariant mass kkpipipi ] , and clear @xmath7 signals are observed with very low background level in the two modes .         using the inclusive mc events sample ,",
    "the potential backgrounds from the @xmath3 decays which may contaminate @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) are estimated .",
    "events from @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath77 , @xmath80 ) may peak at the signal region , and the contributions from these peaking backgrounds are estimated using the detection efficiencies determined from the mc simulations and the corresponding branching fractions from previous measurements  @xcite , and then subtracted .",
    "these background events after final event selection are listed in table  [ table : peaking bkg ksk3pi ] and  [ table : peaking bkg 2k2pipi0 ] ; the errors in the numbers of events are from the uncertainties of the detection efficiency and branching fractions .",
    "the other backgrounds are composed of dozens of decay modes and smoothly distributed in the full mass region ( @xmath81 ) ; this kind of background is described by a second - order chebyshev function .       the besiii collaboration thanks the staff of bepcii and the computing center for their hard efforts .",
