    "<S> we calculate first - order qcd corrections to the cross section for single top quark production mediated by flavor changing neutral currents  ( fcnc ) in @xmath0 collisions at the hera collider . </S>",

    "<S> hence , the study of the electroweak properties of the top - quark sector may shed some light on the mechanism responsible for the ewsb . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , deviations from the standard model predictions might be expected in the large mass top sector . </S>",
    "<S> thus , single top quark physics could probe various physics beyond the standard model : anomalous gluon - top quark couplings  @xcite , anomalous @xmath1 couplings  @xcite , new strong dynamics  @xcite , flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) couplings  @xcite , r - parity violating susy effects  @xcite , cp - violation effects  @xcite , and effects of kaluza - klein excited @xmath2-bosons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> single top quark physics is a very promising place to test the fcnc effects for @xmath3 couplings , where @xmath4- or @xmath5-quark and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> those couplings effectively appear in supersymmetry or in the scenario where new dynamics takes place in the fermion mass generation . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian involving such couplings of a @xmath7 pair to massless bosons is the following : @xmath8 + { \\it h.c.},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the usual electromagnetic and gluon field tensors with respective fcnc @xmath11 and @xmath12 couplings , @xmath13 are the gell - mann matrices , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 the dirac matrices . it was found @xcite that the strength for the anomalous @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) coupling may be probed to @xmath18  ( @xmath19 ) at the tevatron with @xmath20 of data and @xmath21  ( @xmath22 ) at the lhc with @xmath23 of data . </S>",
    "<S> efficiencies from @xcite can be used to put the limits on @xmath24 , @xmath25 couplings  ( @xmath26 , 95%cl ) at the tevatron run 2 : @xmath27 , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> however , better limits ( of the order of 0.044 at run 2 ) on these couplings @xmath11 are expected to come from the study of decays @xmath29 of pair - produced tops . </S>",
    "<S> this process already allows to derive an upper bound @xmath30 from the cdf data taken at tevatron run 1 , which is slightly better than the limit obtained by studying @xmath31 in lep2 data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that hera should provide a very good sensitivity on the fcnc @xmath32 coupling via single top production in the process @xmath33 with the respective diagram shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> alternatively , the relatively large  ( @xmath40 pb ) cross section still allowed by the current cdf limit on @xmath25 would lead to many single top events . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that h1 observed some events with a high @xmath41 isolated lepton  ( @xmath34 or @xmath42 ) , together with missing energy and a large @xmath41 hadronic final state . </S>",
    "<S> such a final state would be expected from single top events , where the @xmath2 coming from the top undergoes a semileptonic decay @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however there is a big ambiguity due to the choice of the qcd scale . </S>",
    "<S> fcnc single top quark production at hera is a @xmath37-channel process involving a massive final state top quark . </S>",
    "<S> the effective qcd scale is unknown : one can not use @xmath43 as the scale , for example , since the kinematical distributions concentrated around @xmath44 are of the order of @xmath45 gev@xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath47 for the parton structure function has no sense .    at the same time @xmath48 seems a little large for this process with such a small value of the @xmath37 variable . for the @xmath49 scale between @xmath50 gev ( minimal @xmath49 for the parton density ) and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 gev the born cross section varies by a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the cross section for a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath52 gev and cteq5 m parton densities  @xcite at @xmath53 is equal to 0.39 pb and at @xmath54 gev equal to 0.78 pb . </S>",
    "<S> this is not surprising for the given very different qcd scales . </S>",
    "<S> first - order qcd corrections should stabilize the cross section with variation of the qcd scale . </S>",
    "<S> this is the subject of this letter .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the first - order qcd corrections to the fcnc single top production using the eikonal approximation . </S>",
    "<S> since the top is very heavy , this process at hera is dominated by the threshold region where the eikonal approximation , which describes soft gluon emission , is valid . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate one - loop eikonal diagrams using techniques developed for top pair production and other qcd hard scattering cross sections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that near threshold the eikonal corrections reproduce the dominant terms of the full qcd corrections for a variety of cross sections both analytically and numerically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also known from resummation studies that these corrections exponentiate , but we will not pursue this topic in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> we define the usual mandelstam invariants for the process @xmath55 as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we also define a variable @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 the top quark and electron masses , respectively . at threshold @xmath62 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : cs](a),(b ) we present the born and one loop results for @xmath52 and 318 gev , respectively , as functions of the qcd scale @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we note the stabilization of the cross section with scale variation when the qcd corrections are included . </S>",
    "<S> since the born+one loop results are very stable throughout the @xmath49 region , it makes little difference what scale we choose for the central value of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we decided to use @xmath73 for the central value and vary the scale by a factor of two , as commonly done . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for @xmath52 gev the qcd corrected cross section is @xmath74 pb and for @xmath75 gev it is @xmath76 pb . the @xmath25 parameter was chosen to be 0.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> one should notice that we did not include in our result the uncertainty due to the top quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> for illustrative purposes we present the born , one - loop , and born+one loop cross sections as functions of the top quark mass and cm energy in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cs - x](a ) and  ( b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> a variation of the top quark mass by @xmath77 gev causes over 20% uncertainty in the total cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the cm energy is very important in this kinematical region , where the quark luminosity quickly increases with the energy : the 6% increase of the cm energy ( @xmath78 gev ) leads to a 40% increase of the total cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> the hera collider has the potential to establish the best limit on the fcnc electromagnetic coupling involving top and @xmath35- quarks . </S>",
    "<S> keeping in mind also the observation of events with isolated leptons , missing transverse momentum , and a jet with large transverse momentum at hera  ( which motivated the experimental studies ) , an accurate limit on the fcnc coupling based on the qcd corrected cross section is very important . </S>"
