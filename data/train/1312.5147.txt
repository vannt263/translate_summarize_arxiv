    "the strong field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite is _ the _ underlying theory describing the interaction of intense laser light with atoms @xcite or molecules @xcite .",
    "it allows to calculate photoelectron @xcite or high - harmonic spectra @xcite and provides a deep understanding of the cut - offs and the interferences observed in these spectra .",
    "however , it has been noted that several spectral features are not reproduced by the plain sfa , examples being radial structures at low photoelectron energies @xcite holographic side - lobes @xcite , or the low - energy structure @xcite .",
    "the reason for this failure of the sfa is the neglect of the coulomb force on the outgoing ( or returning ) photoelectron .",
    "attempts to include coulomb effects have a long history @xcite and continue to date @xcite , mainly because more and more advanced detector technology and _ ab initio _ simulations reveal more and more features _ not _ covered by the plain sfa . in general , the more `` differential '' the observable is , the trickier is the proper inclusion of coulomb effects . while the simplest task is to correct total ionization rates @xcite , much more challenging , for instance , is to get the interference pattern in photoelectron momentum spectra right @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that photoelectrons generated by strong - field ionization of atoms have a cut - off energy of @xmath0 if they move directly to the detector ( or @xmath1 if they rescatter once from their parent ion ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "these are the cut - offs predicted by the plain sfa ( or the sfa extended for one rescattering event , respectively ) , which are hardly affected by the coulomb correction . on the other hand , electrons emitted from laser - irradiated clusters",
    "may have much higher kinetic energies , especially at resonance @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we apply the methodology developed for the coulomb - corrected sfa based on quantum trajectories @xcite to a sfa that is corrected for the collective electric field in the cluster . in this way we are able to show that it is this collective field , which arises because of the coherent oscillation of the electron cloud with respect to the ionic background , that generates multi-@xmath2 electrons .",
    "this finding confirms the sparc effect ( i.e. , `` surface - plasmon - assisted rescattering in clusters '' ) revealed earlier via classical molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to introduce a quantum , sfa - based method for metal clusters that treats the ionization step self - consistently and allows for interference effects .",
    "similar approaches may then be also applied to other situations where collective fields play a role , for instance electron emission from metal nanotips @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , the basic ingredients , i.e. , the sfa , field - corrected quantum orbits , the rigid sphere model for clusters , and the actual numerical implementation are introduced or reviewed . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] a typical photoelectron spectrum obtained for a na@xmath3-cluster close to resonance is presented , and the origin of the fast electrons is revealed by identifying the relevant , collective - field - corrected quantum orbits . finally , we summarize in section [ sec : concl ] . the equation of motion for the electron sphere in the rigid sphere model is derived in [ app : restoringforce ] .",
    "atomic units are used ( in which , numerically , @xmath4 ) unless otherwise noted .",
    "the collective field by which the quantum orbits of the sfa will be corrected is approximated using the rsm . in the rsm",
    "both electrons and ions are modeled by homogeneously charged spheres .",
    "we assume that the radii and the absolute values of the charges of the electron and the ion sphere are equal .",

    "driving this system with an external ( laser ) field in dipole approximation @xmath10 leads to the following equation of motion ( cf .",

    "it is sufficient to apply adiabatically , i.e. , the constant laser amplitude @xmath38 is replaced by @xmath37 .",
    "ion and electron sphere , when centered in the origin , give rise to the same spherical electrostatic potential but with opposite sign , @xmath39 this expression , together with the excursion of the electron sphere @xmath12 in , can be used to construct the cluster potential in which a test electron would move , @xmath40 this potential is shown in and used for the cluster correction in section [ sec : clustercorrection ] . ,",

    "the are accelerated by the collective cluster field .",
    "this is detailed further in , where , besides the canonical momentum , the total electric field `` seen '' by the electron is plotted for each of the relevant trajectories .",
    "this field consists of the laser field and the field generated by the cluster potential . while the laser is treated in dipole approximation , the cluster potential is strongly position - dependent .",
    "as long as the electron is outside the cluster the total field follows the laser field with only small deviations . upon entering the cluster",

    "our quantum orbit analysis shows that the acceleration mechanism responsible for the plateau in the spectrum is the additional interaction with the cluster potential in phase with the oscillation of the electron cloud .",
    "the magnitude of the acceleration is directly associated with the maximal elongation of the electron cloud , which limits the total field strength during the electron passage . only electrons arriving at the right phase are accelerated by this process .",
    "this leads to the emission of fast electron bunches within narrow time windows , clearly seen in .",
    "another observation is that the selected group of trajectories has a peak momentum where the trajectories accumulate , resulting in a sharp peak at the cut - off momentum in the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "such caustics are known to appear in semi - classical descriptions of quantum dynamics .",
    "although they are typically smoothed in a full quantum treatment , remnants may survive and be observable @xcite .",
    "we developed a collective - field - corrected strong field approximation ( cfsfa ) that is capable of explaining energetic electron emission from laser - irradiated metal clusters close to resonance .",
    "the approach is basically a combination of the ideas already used for a coulomb - corrected sfa based on quantum orbits and the rigid - sphere model of cluster physics .",
    "the latter is used to estimate the collective field acting on the quantum orbits .",
    "so - called `` long trajectories '' , well known from the quantum orbit analysis of the plain sfa , that revisit the cluster interior with the right phase are accelerated by the collective field .",
    "the advantage of the cfsfa compared to classical calculations is that it treats the ionization step self - consistently .",
    "moreover , the method allows for interference , which is essential for , e.g. , the formation of above - threshold ionization peaks , holographic imaging , or any scheme in which structural information is inferred from interference patterns .",

    "<S> the strong field approximation ( sfa ) formulated in terms of so - called `` quantum orbits '' led to much insight into intense - laser driven ionization dynamics . in plain sfa , </S>",
    "<S> the emitted electron is treated as a free electron in the laser field alone . however , with improving experimental techniques and more advanced numerical simulations it becomes more and more obvious that the plain sfa misses interesting effects even on a qualitative level . </S>",
    "<S> examples are holographic side lobes , the low - energy structure , radial patterns in photoelectron spectra at low kinetic energies , and strongly rotated angular distributions . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason increasing effort has been recently devoted to coulomb corrections of the sfa . in the current paper , we follow a similar line but consider ionization of metal clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that photoelectrons from clusters can be much more energetic than those emitted from atoms or small molecules , especially if the mie resonance of the expanding cluster is evoked . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a sfa that takes the collective field inside the cluster via the simple rigid - sphere model into account . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on field - corrected quantum orbits so that the acceleration process ( or any other spectral feature of interest ) can be investigated in detail . </S>"
