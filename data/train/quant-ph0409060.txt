    "tunneling is one of the most important quantum phenomena that has been widely applied in science and technology . for years",
    ", the stationary treatments of tunneling were sufficient for many practical purposes , and the details of tunneling dynamics were not urgent issues to investigate .",
    "this is not the case anymore .",
    "the interest in tunneling dynamics is increasing as , for example , the number of carriers involved in tunneling events decreases due to the rapid downsizing of semiconductor devices . in principle",
    ", the tunneling dynamics can be completely understood if one can solve the time dependent schrdinger equation , taking other degrees of freedom into account that affect the tunneling particles .",
    "this is , however , a difficult task in general .",
    "it is thus important to study the time scales of tunneling dynamics ( tunneling times ) in simplified models and use them for qualitative understanding of the tunneling dynamics in realistic systems .",
    "there are many approaches to define or measure the tunneling times in simplified models @xcite , and the quantum shutter approach @xcite is one of them . the present paper concerns a generalization of the quantum shutter approach .",
    "let us consider a one dimensional scattering problem where a particle is incident on a potential @xmath0 .",
    "the time scales that characterize the tunneling dynamics are `` embedded \" in the wave function . to extract them from the wave function ,",
    "the quantum shutter approach @xcite uses a cutoff plane wave as the initial condition and monitors how the probability density changes in time at a specified position ( e.g. , at the exit of the barrier ) or in a spatial region ( e.g. , in the well region in a double barrier structure ) to find out the time scales that characterize the transient behavior of the wave function ( from nonstationary to stationary ) .",
    "the use of a cutoff plane wave initial condition can be understood as an analogy to the use of a step input in the study of the temporal response of an electrical ( e.g. , rcl ) circuit .",
    "studies of tunneling dynamics involving cutoff plane waves go back back to stevens @xcite , who argued the signal velocity under the barrier by applying the contour deformation technique developed by brillouin @xcite .",
    "this technique allows one to decompose a wave propagating in a dispersive medium into three parts : the fore - runners , the monochromatic part oscillating with the same frequency as the source , and the after - runners ; the signal velocity is then defined as the velocity with which the monochromatic front moves .",
    "the under - the - barrier signal velocity found by stevens was , however , questioned later by teranishi _",
    "et al _ @xcite , jauho and jonson @xcite , and ranfagni _ et al _ @xcite ; these authors showed that the monochromatic front to which the signal velocity is attributed is in fact not appreciable in magnitude . through these works",
    ", it was recognized that it is not appropriate to focus only on the monochromatic part of the wave .",
    "bttiker and thomas @xcite and muga and bttiker @xcite thus studied not only the monochromatic part but also the fore - runners in detail , whereas brouard and muga @xcite turned their attention to the total wave function ( under a cutoff plane wave initial condition ) and studied its properties with an exact analytical expression for the wave function which they derived .",
    "independently , garca - caldern and rubio @xcite derived an exact analytical expression for the wave function with a cutoff plane wave initial condition and applied it to the analysis of the transient behaviors in the tunneling dynamics .",
    "it may be said that these studies formed a new area of research in the field of quantum dynamics , where one explores the tunneling dynamics , especially its transient behaviors , by using exact analytical expressions for the wave functions with cutoff plane wave initial conditions .",
    "the quantum shutter approach @xcite and the approach by brouard and muga @xcite use the same tool called @xmath1 function [ see eq . ( [ eq:3 ] ) ] to express the wave functions in analytical manners .",
    "they differ , however , in the following respect : in addition to the @xmath1 function , the quantum shutter approach uses the resonant eigenfunctions , while the approach by brouard and muga uses an entire function that arises from a pole expansion of a function involved in the momentum eigenfunction expansion of the wave functions . in @xcite , an analytical expression for the transmitted wave",
    "was obtained in sole terms of the @xmath1 function and the poles and the residues of the transmission amplitude .",
    "another interesting and unexpected aspect of the quantum shutter approach is that it has a close relationship with the consistent history approach to the tunneling time problem as shown in @xcite . in particular , the probability density at the exit of a rectangular barrier under a cutoff plane wave initial condition , a quantity of major concern in the quantum shutter approach , coincides , when properly normalized , with a function @xmath2 that is defined in the consistent history approach .",
    "function @xmath2 allows us to associate the transient behaviors of the wave function with the interference between feynman histories with different tunneling times , which provides a novel viewpoint to the transient behavior . in this way",
    ", the quantum shutter approach is related not only to the stream of research that began with the work of stevens but also to a relatively new approach , the consistent history approach , to the tunneling time problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the consistent history approach was used to give different tunneling times in a unified manner .",
    "the quantum shutter approach , formulated for a general ( but finite - range ) potential , has been applied to single barriers @xcite , double barriers @xcite , and to a more general superlattice structure @xcite . for the case of tunneling through a single barrier ,",
    "the probability density at the exit of the barrier was found to have a peaked structure , which is called the _ time - domain resonance_. the time @xmath3 , corresponding to the peaked value of the resonance , has been studied in detail as a function of the system parameters and has been proposed as a tunneling time scale @xcite . for the case of tunneling through a multi - barrier resonant structure , the buildup process in the well region(s ) has been also studied , with the expectation that it has important implications on the speed of resonant tunneling devices @xcite . these studies , while demonstrating the usefulness of the quantum shutter approach , raise a natural question : to what extent do the results obtained from the approach , in particular the existence of the _ time - domain resonance _ , depend on the special form of the initial conditions ? to answer this question , it is necessary to extend the approach to a more general class of initial conditions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide an extension of the quantum shutter approach to a type of wave packet initial condition , which reduces itself to the cutoff plane wave initial condition in the limit of an infinite packet width .",
    "this extension does not change the analytical scheme of the approach , so that the time evolved wave function continues to be available in an analytical form .",
    "we apply the extended approach to tunneling through a square barrier to study how the time - domain resonance is affected by the width of the initial wave packet .",
    "the quantum shutter approach assumes an arbitrary but finite - range potential @xmath0 [ in this paper @xmath0 is such that it vanishes for @xmath4 and for @xmath5 and uses , for example , the following form of the cut off plane wave as the initial wave function : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wave number .",
    "this setup corresponds to the physical situation where a beam of particles with energy @xmath8 ( though not exactly monochromatic due to the sharp front of the wave ) impinges on a shutter placed at @xmath9 , just at the left edge of the potential ; the tunneling process begins with the instantaneous opening of the shutter at @xmath10 , enabling the incoming wave to interact with the potential for @xmath11 . when the initial condition is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , the exact solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation along the transmitted region @xmath12 is found to be @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the @xmath15-th pole of the transmission amplitude @xmath16 ( poles lie in the lower - half of the complex @xmath17 plane ) , @xmath18 is the associated residue , and the @xmath1 functions are defined by @xmath19 & = & \\frac{1}{2}e^{(imx^2/2\\hbar t)}w(iy_q ) ,   \\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 ; the function @xmath21 , which is often called faddeeva function , is related to the complex complementary error function as @xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 .",

    "some computer programs are available for numerical calculation of the @xmath25 function @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the following initial condition : @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and `` c.c",
    ". \" stands for complex conjugate",
    ". an important feature of this @xmath29 is that it automatically vanishes for @xmath30 .",
    "this is immediately seen from the fact that the integrand @xmath31 , which corresponds to the lorentzian momentum distribution centered at @xmath32 with width @xmath33 , has a simple pole only in the lower - half of the complex @xmath17-plane .",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath29 can be easily obtained by the method of residues .",
    "we find @xmath34 this represents a wave packet .",
    "a measure of the packet width is @xmath35 .",

    "the above @xmath29 is therefore a wave packet counterpart of the cut - off plane wave initial condition .",

( [ eq:2 ] ) ; we can see a transient behavior of the probability density that starts from zero , increases to the maximum , and then approaches its asymptotic value @xmath89 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "the peaked structure is an example of the _ time - domain resonance _ @xcite . in the present example , the time @xmath3 that gives the maximum of @xmath81 is about @xmath90 .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) obtained from eq . ( [ eq:12 ] ) show respectively the case of @xmath91 and the case of @xmath92 . unlike the case of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , the probability density approaches zero for large values of @xmath93 in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this is simply because the particle is eventually reflected or transmitted for the wave packet initial condition .",
    "we first find from the graphs that the peaked nature of @xmath81 is not lost ( i.e. , the time - domain resonance is preserved ) even for relatively large values of @xmath86 ( and thus for relatively narrow packets in configuration space ) . in the case of fig .",

    "although the average energy is below the barrier height in both cases , we must note that only the case of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( b ) can be associated with tunneling as explained below .    in what follows",
    "we refer to two different approaches to distinguish between tunneling and non - tunneling processes .",
    "the first one involves a stationary analysis whereas the second one deals with a time - dependent description . for wave packet initial conditions ,",
    "the first approach relies on the computation of both the tunneling probability @xmath102 ( i.e. , the probability of under - the - barrier transmission ) , and the non - tunneling probability @xmath103 ( i.e. , the probability of over - the - barrier transmission ) defined by @xmath104 p_{\\rm over}=\\int_{k_v}^\\infty dk|t(k)|^2|\\phi(k)|^2 . \\label{over}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of fig .",

    "[ fig1 ]  ( c ) , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , so that over - the - barrier transmission dominates and the process is not in the tunneling regime .",
    "the second approach deals with a time - frequency analysis @xcite , where we introduce the local average frequency @xmath109 ( the instantaneous frequency of the wave function ) and the instantaneous bandwidth @xmath110 ( the spread of frequencies around @xmath109 ) as follows @xcite : @xmath111 \\sigma(t)&=&\\left\\vert{\\rm re}\\,\\left(\\frac{1}{\\psi}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t}\\right)\\right\\vert.\\label{eq:14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the local average frequency was used in refs . @xcite and the local bandwidth in ref .",
    "@xcite in the studies of tunneling time .",
    "it is immediate from eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) that @xmath112 , i.e. , the wave function has a single instantaneous frequency , when @xmath113 , which holds at the time domain resonance peak at @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , the time domain resonance peak is characterized by a single instantaneous frequency @xmath109 , or equivalently , by a single energy @xmath115 .",
    "this was exemplified in ref .",
    "we have calculated @xmath109 at the time domain resonance peak , namely , @xmath116 , to find that @xmath117 , with @xmath118 , is @xmath119 @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 for the case of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "this implies that the time domain resonance peak is associated with tunneling for the case of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , but it is not for the case of fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( c ) since @xmath123 .",
    "we have thus shown , using two different approaches , that figs .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to tunneling , but fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( c ) does not .    as shown above",
    ", @xmath3 is not very sensitive to the width of the packets in the tunneling regime .",
    "this in turn justifies the use of the cutoff plane wave initial condition as far as the estimation of the value of @xmath3 in the tunneling regime is concerned ; @xmath3 is expected to characterize the earliest tunneling response of the system @xcite and thus , it would be of relevance for device applications .",
    "a comparison of @xmath3 with other tunneling time scales , such as the delay time , the bttiker traversal time , and the semiclassical time , has been given elsewhere @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the time - domain resonance was also studied with a cutoff pulse initial condition given by @xmath124 for @xmath125 , and zero otherwise .",
    "it was found that the resulting time - domain resonance structure is almost identical to the one obtained with the semi - infinite cutoff plane wave initial condition , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with our result that the time - domain resonance structure is not quite sensitive to the packet width . on the other hand , the oscillatory behavior of the probability density in the `` post resonance `` time domain ( see fig .",
    "@xcite ) can not be seen in our results .",
    "this implies that the probability density in the `` post resonance '' time domain is sensitive to the shape of the incident wave .",
    "in summary , we have extended the type of initial conditions used in the quantum shutter approach from shuttered plane waves to a certain class of wave packets .",
    "this makes it possible to study the `` size effect \" of the packets on the various results that had been obtained from the quantum shutter approach with shuttered plane wave initial conditions .",
    "we have derived an analytical expression for the time evolved wave function , eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) , under the wave packet initial condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "focusing on the size effect on the time domain resonance , we exemplified that ( i ) the time - domain resonance structure is present even when the packet width @xmath35 is much shorter than the barrier width , a situation that is quite different from those considered in the original quantum shutter approach , where the incident wave is semi infinite , and ( ii ) the time @xmath3 at which the time resonance peak occurs is not very sensitive to the packet width when the transmission process is in the tunneling regime . in this sense ,",
