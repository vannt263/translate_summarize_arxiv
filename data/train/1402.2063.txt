    "the first attempt at investigating the end - state of gravitational collapse of a bounded matter distribution within the realm of general relativity was due to the efforts of oppenheimer and snyder @xcite in which they considered the gravitational collapse of a dust sphere .",
    "although highly idealised , the oppenheimer - snyder dust model paved the way for more realistic collapse models .",
    "the singularity theorems of hawking and penrose assert that given a trapped surface a singularity forms which could be covered or naked @xcite . the discovery of naked singularities as the possible end - states of gravitational collapse added a new dimension to the study of cosmic censorship .",
    "this led to a renewed search of physically reasonable matter distributions avoiding the formation of the horizon during gravitational collapse .",
    "the inclusion of pressure , shear , bulk viscous effects and dissipation in the form of heat flow within the stellar fluid became possible to study with the discovery of vaidya s radiating solution for the exterior of the star @xcite .",
    "the junction conditions meshing the interior spacetime to the vaidya atmosphere were obtained by santos in 1985 @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the dissipative collapse model is the nonvanishing of the radial pressure at the boundary of the collapsing star . in the presence of a radial heat flux",
    ", santos showed that the pressure is proportional to the magnitude of the heat flux at the surface of the star .",
    "this gives rise to a dynamical equation which , in principle , establishes the temporal evolution of the collapsing star .",
    "the problem of dissipative collapse was extensively investigated in its generality by herrera and co - workers who established many general frameworks of the collapse scenario .",
    "it was then possible to obtain exact solutions describing radiating , collapsing spheres and these were largely due to herrera and co - workers and maharaj and co - workers , amongst others .",
    "the vaidya solution is the unique spherically symmetric solution of the einstein field equations representing a radiation atmosphere .",
    "this solution has been extensively studied in the literature especially within the realm of cosmic censorship including the collapse of charged null fluid , mixture of quark and null fluid , higher dimensional radiation fluids and and modified gravity models .",
    "the so - called generalised vaidya solution in which the mass function depends on both the radial and null coordinate can be thought of as an atmosphere comprising of null fluid and strings .",
    "the generalised vaidya solution has been utilised to study the outcome of gravitational collapse in various scenarios including the formation of naked singularities in classical general relativity , modeling dissipative collapse and studying radiating black hole solutions in higher dimensions within the einstein - yang - mills - gauss - bonnet framework@xcite .",
    "the junction conditions required for the matching of a spherically symmetric line element to the generalised vaidya solution was presented by maharaj _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "these results generalised the earlier junction conditions obtained by santos .",
    "it was shown that the continuity of the momentum flux across the boundary of the collapsing star required the nonvanishing of the surface pressure .",
    "in addition to the pressure being proportional to the magnitude of the heat flux ( as in the case of a pure radiation atmosphere ) , it was shown that for the two - fluid atmosphere the surface pressure depends on the heat flux and the string density .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the string density on the thermal behaviour of the collapsing star . to this end , we adopt a causal heat transport equation to obtain both the eckart temperature as well as the causal temperature throughout the stellar interior .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the interior spacetime and matter content .",
    "the generalised vaidya solution together with the appropriate junction conditions are presented in section 3 .",
    "the evolution of the temperature profile in both the causal and noncausal theories are obtained in section 4 .",
    "a discussion of the time of formation of horizon is discussed in section 5 .",
    "we finally conclude with a discussion of our results and make comparisons with earlier findings in section 6 .",
    "the interior spacetime of our radiating star is described by a spherically symmetric , shear - free line element given by@xcite @xmath0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are metric functions yet to be determined .",
    "the interior stellar material is represented by a perfect fluid with heat flux : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density , @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath6 is the magnitude of the heat flux .",
    "the fluid four  velocity @xmath7 is comoving and is given by @xmath8 the heat flow vector takes the form @xmath9 since @xmath10 and the heat is assumed to flow in the radial direction .",
    "the fluid collapse rate @xmath11 of the stellar model is given by @xmath12 for the line element ( [ g1 ] ) the einstein field equations yield @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the covariant scalar measure of the heat flux .",
    "it follows that if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are known , then the system ( [ g3a])([g3d ] ) yield the matter variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the nonvanishing components of the weyl tensor are all proportional to @xmath19 where @xmath20.\\ ] ] various approaches have been utilised to generate exact solutions of the einstein field equations ( [ g3a ] ) - ( [ g3d ] ) .",
    "these include imposing an equation of state , acceleration - free collapse , expansion - free collapse and conformal flatness .",
    "conformally flat , radiating spheres have been extensively studied in the literature in which the interior matter distribution is a perfect fluid with heat flux@xcite . here",
    "we extend the conformally flat radiating solutions obtained in earlier treatments to include a null string fluid . to this end",
    "we require the vanishing of the weyl stresses within the stellar interior which implies @xmath21 yielding _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @xmath22 the condition of pressure isotropy is obtained by equating ( [ g3b ] ) and ( [ g3c ] ) @xmath23 which easily integrates to @xmath24 the einstein field equations ( [ g3a])-([g3d ] ) can now be written as @xcite @xmath25 + \\frac{4}{c_1r^2 + 1}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times[c_2(c_2 - 2c_1c_3)r^2 + c_3(c_1c_3 - 2c_2)]\\label{fieldb}\\\\ q & = & 4({\\dot c_3}c_1 - { \\dot c_2})\\left(\\frac{c_2r^2 + c_3}{c_1r^2 + 1}\\right)^2r\\label{fieldc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note from ( [ g4 ] ) and ( [ g6 ] ) that the temporal behaviour of the metric functions are yet to determined .",

    "@xcite in which they established the link between inhomogeneity and dissipation .",
    "further studies yielded new exact solutions in which the weyl stresses vanished within the stellar interior @xcite .",
    "these models made it possible to study relaxational effects on the temperature profiles of stars with conformally flat interiors .",

    "this is an idealisation using the fluid approximation . in realistic stellar models",
    "gravitational collapse is preceded by an epoch of neutrino emission .",
    "the angular momentum associated with these neutrinos as they escape from the neutrino - sphere leads to tangential stresses .",
    "in addition , neutrino trapping within the stellar interior may render the core viscous .",
    "shear viscosity has been extensively investigated in various scenarios in which the principle stresses are unequal .",
    "our model of dissipative collapse is , in this sense , highly simplified but nevertheless serves as an important tool to test more realistic scenarios and numerical models .",

    "the inclusion of strings in astrophysical scenarios has been linked to atmospheres surrounding black holes as well as dark matter constituents in globular clusters .",
    "the radial pressure within the vaidya atmosphere can be attributed to the string tension . in the standard vaidya envelope with photons carrying energy away from the stellar core",
    ", santos@xcite was able to show that the radial pressure is proportional to the heat flux at the boundary of the radiating star .",
    "this boundary condition determines the temporal evolution of the model . with the generalised vaidya atmosphere it is the photons that carry energy to the exterior spacetime with the strings diffusing inwards .",
    "our intention is to determine the effect of the string flux on physical parameters such as temperature and luminosity in our models .",

    "it has been shown that relaxational effects give rise to substantially different luminosity profiles as compared to profiles corresponding to vanishing relaxational times .",

    "for a temperature of @xmath57k , the relaxation time is of the order of @xmath58s @xcite .",
    "in order to study the role played by the relaxation time when the star leaves hydrostatic equilibrium we utilise a causal heat transport equation of maxwell - cattaneo form given by @xcite @xmath59 where we have assumed no viscous - heat coupling of the thermodynamical fluxes .",
    "various authors have highlighted the importance of the relaxation time on the evolution of the temperature and luminosity profiles of the collapsing star .",
    "the eckart tranport equation obtained by setting @xmath60 in ( [ cmc ] ) suffers various pathologies such as the prediction of infinite propagation velocities for the thermal signals and unstable equilibrium states @xcite . a general framework adopting a full causal approach to dissipative collapse was presented by herrera _",
    "et al _ in which the full causal transport equations are coupled to the dynamical equations governing the stellar interior @xcite .",
    "we assume that during late stages of collapse heat dissipation occurs via neutrino emission .",
    "the neutrinos are thermally generated within the stellar core with energies of the order of @xmath61 . at neutron star densities",
    "neutrino trapping takes place via electron - neutrino scattering and nucleon absorption . the mean collision time for thermally generated neutrinos is given by @xmath62 to good approximation @xcite",
    "following ( [ tauu ] ) we adopt a power - law dependence for the thermal conductivity and relaxation time : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants .",
    "we further assume that the relaxation time is directly proportional to the mean collision time @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is a constant .",
    "the causal transport equation ( [ cmc ] ) together with the above assumptions reduces to @xmath70 where the eckart temperature @xmath71 is obtained by setting @xmath72 in ( [ temp1 ] ) .",
    "we are in a position to study the evolution of the temperature profile for the case @xmath73 which corresponds to constant collision time . in the case of constant mean collision time the causal transport equation ( [ temp1 ] ) is simply integrated to yield , @xmath74 + f(t ) \\label{caus0}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is an arbitrary function of integration .",

    "the choice of @xmath85 ensures that the matter variables as defined by ( [ fielda])-([fieldc ] ) and the metric functions are physically viable for some finite epoch of the collapse period . in order to generate the plots in figures 1 and 2 we choose the following values for our arbitrary constants : @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the causal temperature profiles correspond to @xmath72 and an earlier time @xmath89 ( stellar fluid is close to hydrostatic equilibrium ) . for the causal temperature we take @xmath90 corresponding to late - time evolution , @xmath91 ( fluid is in quasi - static equilibrium ) . in figure 1",

    "the two temperature profiles are very similar in magnitude and behaviour throughout the stellar core .",
    "this is expected as the stellar fluid is very close to hydrostatic equilibrium , corresponding to early stages of collapse .",
    "the noncausal temperature at the center of the star is enhanced by approximately 15@xmath94 in the presence of the string fluid in the exterior .",
    "figure 2 clearly indicates that the casual temperatures are higher than their noncausal counterparts throughout the star .",
    "the causal temperature is sensitive to the presence of the string distribution in the exterior and our model indicates a @xmath95 to @xmath96 enhancement of the temperature at @xmath97 .",
    "it is also evident that the temperature for the two - fluid atmosphere diverges significantly from the temperature of the standard vaidya exterior .",
    "we can think of this late - time evolution of the temperature in terms of the heat generated during this epoch .",
    "as the core collapses the heat generated will be higher than the initial stages of collapse . to maintain a higher temperature distribution throughout the interior of the star",
    ", we can think of the string distribution in the exterior as reducing the heat dissipation from the interior .",

    "recall that our analyses of both the causal and noncausal temperature profiles indicate a higher core temperature in the presence of a two - fluid atmosphere ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "this indicates that the heat dissipation to the exterior is reduced which has the corresponding effect of reducing the outward pressure required to maintain stability .",

    ", the string component can lead to an earlier formation of the horizon thus avoiding the divergence of the luminosity .",
    "we have modeled a radiating star undergoing dissipative collapse with the exterior spacetime described by the generalised vaidya solution .",

    "we have solved the boundary condition required for the smooth matching of the interior spacetime to the generalised vaidya solution by assuming a constant string density for the surrounding atmosphere .",

    "we have shown that during the initial stages of collapse the influence of the string density is minimal on the temperature profile . during late - time collapse",
