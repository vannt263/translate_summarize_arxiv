    "it is one of the most well - known and unintuitive features of quantum mechanics that entangled quantum systems can , in a way that disturbed einstein , instantaneously affect each other .",
    "specifically , the famous einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) paper of 1935 @xcite , which made the first prediction of this feature , used it to argue that quantum mechanics itself must be incomplete .",
    "the epr paper presents a thought experiment involving a maximally entangled state of two systems , for which measurement of the first ( alice s ) system forces the second ( bob s ) system into one of a set of basis states , with the basis depending on the choice of measurement made upon the first .",
    "that is , alice s choice of measurement determines which of bob s observables is predictable by her . but epr implicitly rule out instantaneous action - at - a - distance , assuming that  no real change can take place in the second system in consequence of anything that may be done to the first system , \" ( that is , bob s system is not disturbed @xcite , explaining why einstein was ) .",
    "hence they conclude that these different observables must have well - defined values regardless of alice s choice of measurement . but",
    "quantum mechanics forbids simultaneous values for non - commuting observables .",
    "thus , they say , `` the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality . ''",
    "contrary to epr , schrdinger argued , in the same year @xcite , that quantum mechanics was not incomplete , but idealised .",
    "he used the term `` steering '' for the effect epr identified , namely that `` as a consequence of two different measurements performed upon the first system , the second system may be left in states with two different [ types of ] wavefunctions . '' but he thought this was unrealistic when describing systems that are spatially distant , because some sort of decoherence would prevent the entanglement from being established in such situations . in this way , he , too , thought that instantaneous action _ at a distance _ could be kept out of the most fundamental description of reality .",
    "the epr paper advocated the possibility of local hidden variables ( lhvs ) in quantum systems which would account for the illusory ( in their view ) nonlocality in the theory @xcite .",
    "however , it was proved by bell in 1964 @xcite that there exist predictions of quantum mechanics for which no possible lhv model could account . finally , in 1982 , examples of bell nonlocality were experimentally realised @xcite . even without a loophole - free test of bell nonlocality , it has become widely accepted that ( contrary to schrdinger s hope ) entanglement can exist over long distances , and that bell nonlocality is real .    entanglement and bell nonlocality",
    "have been rigorously defined for decades ; however , it was not until relatively recently ( 2007 @xcite ) that the particular class of nonlocality described in the epr paper was actually formalised .",
    "the ability of an entangled quantum state to nonlocally affect another ( though not necessarily vice versa @xcite ; see also$ ] , if alice s efficiency is less than @xmath1 then epr - steering by her is impossible , while bob s efficiency is irrelevant .",
    "motived by this , consider a werner state of which one side has passed through a lossy channel which replaces the qubit state by the vacuum state @xmath2 with probability @xmath3 .",
    "this creates the qutrit - qubit state @xmath4 + p { | v \\rangle}{\\langle v |}\\otimes i^\\beta/2 $ ] , where here @xmath5 is a singlet state in the two - qubit subspace , and @xmath6 is understood to act only on this subspace . by construction , alice can not steer bob , but bob can steer alice because alice ( now considered trusted ) can simply consider steering in her qubit subspace . ] ) has come to be known as _ epr - steering _ @xcite .",
    "the nonlocality described in the epr paper had been studied mainly in the context of their position ",
    "momentum example ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) but the formal notion introduced in ref .  @xcite has opened the door to a series of new experiments . following the first demonstration of this general notion of epr - steering in @xcite , three experiments have each closed the detection loophole in tests of epr - steering .",
    "one did so while also closing the locality loophole over 48 m @xcite ( thus definitively disproving schrdinger s suggested resolution of the epr paradox ) .",
    "another closed the detection loophole with only two different measurements ( as in the original epr scenario ) by employing state - of - the - art transition edge detectors @xcite .",
    "the remaining paper closed the detection loophole using commonplace photon detectors while also enduring the losses of transmitting the measured photons through an extra kilometre of fibre - optic cable @xcite .",
    "the accomplishments of this third paper are due to the highly loss - tolerant epr - steering criteria that it employed to rigorously close the detection loophole .",
    "reference  @xcite describes the formulation of these criteria in more detail , also showing them to be more loss - tolerant than another class of epr - steering criteria ( which includes those used in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper , we reconsider those criteria and reveal that they are actually not optimally loss - tolerant epr - steering criteria . in doing so , we demonstrate a method for optimising similar tests of epr - steering , and show that the optimal measurement strategies for such an experiment are just as practicable , significantly more more loss - tolerant in some regimes , and are ( unlike those used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) applicable for an arbitrary number of different measurements by alice .    in sec .",
    "ii of this paper , we briefly review the operational definition of epr - steering and the family of states we consider in this paper . in sec .",
    "iii we review linear epr - steering criteria , including postselection , then identify and close the inefficient detection loophole this potentially incurs @xcite .",
    "we then review , in sec .",
    "iv , the epr - steering criteria obtained when using platonic solid measurement strategies .",
    "we discuss the limitations of platonic solid strategies , including their inherent restrictions in measurement number @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , and consider geodesic solid strategies ( introduced for @xmath8 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which circumvent this restriction .    going from platonic solids to geodesic solids is a more radical step than it may first appear . because it is no longer the case that every vertex is equivalent to every other",
    ", a non - trivial constraint can be used to obtain stronger criteria ( than those in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : that , when post - selection by alice is allowed , the probability of a null result be independent of alice s measurement choice . moreover , there is no longer any symmetry - based justification for all vertices to be equally weighted ; for a geodesic solid comprising two dual platonic solids ( such as the @xmath8 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath9 here ) even tighter criteria will result from weighting the two sets differently .",
    "all this is introduced in sec .",
    "iv , and serves as a springboard to the completely general consideration in sec .",
    "v. there , we allow arbitrary arrangements of @xmath0 vertices , with arbitrary weighting of each vertex , and find still tighter criteria for @xmath0 ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . for the states we consider ,",
    "these are the most loss - tolerant epr - steering criteria possible for any chosen number of measurements , @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "vi with a discussion of experimental practicalities and future work .",
    "therein , we address the benefits and difficulties presented by the most optimal measurement strategies for each @xmath0 , and consider whether optimality alone necessarily makes these the best possible choices for constructing experimental tests of epr - steering .",
    "the operational definition of epr - steering that we employ in this paper is such that one experimental party , bob , possesses a quantum state , and another party , alice , claims to possess a state that is entangled with bob s .",
    "bob asks alice to make one out of a pre - specified set of measurements on her state , and inform him of her results .",
    "using both alice s results and the results of his own measurements on his system , bob then calculates the value of some epr - steering parameter and is only convinced that alice is telling the truth if there is no local hidden state ( lhs ) model which could attain the same value .",
    "lhs models assume that bob s quantum state is preexisting , and can only depend on alice s results as much as can be explained by some local ( to alice ) hidden variable that may be correlated with bob s state .",
    "this is used to define epr - steering bounds by constructing a theoretical limit on some property of bob s system , based on the assumption that bob s quantum system can not be nonlocally affected by alice s measurements .",
    "thus , a violation of this limit demonstrates epr - steering .",
    "the epr - steering criteria that we will use are based upon measurements of qubit observables ( typcially photon polarisation , but we will also use the terminology of spin ) . moreover , we specialise to criteria suitable for two - photon entangled states that are werner states : @xmath12 where @xmath5 represents the spin singlet state : @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 superscripts respectively denote properties of alice s and bob s subsystems .",
    "the second term represents pairs of qubits that are uncorrelated , and the first term represents qubits that are maximally entangled .",
    "thus the purity parameter @xmath16 determines the degree of entanglement in the ensemble @xmath17 , with entanglement being present for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we will consider epr - steering criteria that are analogous to ( linear ) entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "that is , the expectation value of a correlation function between alice and bob s spin measurements , summed over the measurement settings . since in tests of epr - steering",
    "we can not trust alice s detectors or the results she states @xcite , this correlation function must be defined generally as a classical expectation value over alice s reported result @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 , as follows : @xmath21 ,   \\label{eq : sn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where each @xmath22 denotes a particular measurement setting on the bloch sphere , and @xmath0 denotes the total number of such settings .",
    "bob s qubit observable is @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the result alice submits for her measurement .",
    "we can restrict alice s results to these values of equal magnitude because of the symmetry of the werner state .",
    "if alice , and her detectors , were trustworthy , then the result @xmath19 would correspond to a measurement of her qubit observable @xmath25 .",
    "then the correlation function between alice and bob s results can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the state of bob s system , conditioned upon @xmath19 being the result of alice s measurement . if alice and bob share an entangled state as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : werner ] ) , and @xmath28 , then the value of this function is easily shown to be @xmath29 .",
    "however , bob must consider that alice might not share an entangled state with him , and could be employing an lhs model , in which case @xmath30 would be calculated from @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the local hidden variable(s ) inherent to bob s system , upon which alice bases her knowledge of bob s state . in this scenario",
    ", bob receives each state @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 , and alice submits results @xmath35 dependent upon both @xmath22 and @xmath32 .",
    "this expression relies on the assumption that there is an lhs model of bob s system , the existence of which means that there is a bound upon eq .",
    "( [ eq : lhs ] ) that is not present in a quantum mechanical system @xcite .    in order to ensure that this is as rigorous a test as possible , in defining our epr - steering bound we will assume that alice controls anything that depends upon the hidden variable(s ) , @xmath32 ; namely , @xmath34 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 .",
    "note that the only thing that does not have any dependence upon @xmath32 is bob s choice of measurement .",
    "the assumption of locality in this lhs model is manifested in alice s inability to influence or predict bob s measurement choice . to this end",
    ", we must assume that bob randomises the order in which he performs each of his measurements , and that alice does not have foreknowledge of , or access to , his random number generation ( this is referred to in other works as the free will assumption @xcite , which we will not be further addressing ) .    under the above conditions , it is apparent that @xmath36 is bounded above by @xmath37 , which is always achievable by choosing a suitable sign for @xmath35 . a proof of this , and of which ensembles of states a cheating alice can use to attain this optimal value , are given in ref .",
    "but if the only concern is to maximise @xmath38 ( an assumption to which we will return in sec .",
    "[ sec : globaloptimal ] ) then this can clearly be achieved for a single state @xmath33 . even if there were more than one state that maximised @xmath38 , there is no reason ( at this stage ) for alice to use more than one .",
    "therefore , we can take @xmath39 for that state , and @xmath32 will now denote any choice that maximises @xmath30",
    ". the @xmath35 values corresponding to this choice are obviously @xmath40",
    ". however , to evaluate the bound on @xmath38 it is more convenient to keep @xmath41 , writing @xmath42 with the representation on the right being included to highlight that this entire value can be considered as the expectation value of an operator . to seek out the largest possible value of this expression ,",
    "we will use the fact that the largest possible expectation value of any operator is equal to the largest eigenvalue of that operator .",
    "therefore , the epr - steering bound we can derive for @xmath30 is @xmath43,\\label{eq : kbound}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 denotes the maximum eigenvalue of this operator , and the other maximisation is over the @xmath0 values of @xmath41 .",
    "it should be noted that the normalisation factor of @xmath45 in all of the above expressions , stemming from its introduction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sn ] ) , is generally paired with the sum over @xmath0 measurements so that the values of @xmath38 ( and related quantities ) are limited to @xmath46 .",
    "this restricts the values of @xmath38 to the same range for any @xmath0-value , allowing meaningful comparison between them .",
    "while it seems logical to weight each measurement result equally , by applying @xmath47 to each term or to the whole sum , we will re - evaluate this assumption in sec .",
    "iv.c .      in keeping with our assumption of locality ,",
    "any null results that bob obtains for his measurements can not be predicted by , or used to any advantage by a cheating alice in an lhs model . because we trust that bob s state , and his measurement thereof ,",
    "is governed by our quantum mechanical model of it , we can assume that bob s probability of missing any result is independent of the value that result would have taken ( had it not been null ) .",
    "therefore , we will assume that the probability distribution of the results bob did not obtain would have been the same as the probability distribution of bob s measured results .",
    "this is known as a fair sampling assumption ( fsa ) , and is generally valid for quantum systems as it is based upon the principles of quantum mechanics ( in the behaviour of detectors ) . however , since we can not assume that alice s results are generated through measurement of a quantum state , we can not apply any fsa to her results in any test of epr - steering ( which is , in part , a test of quantum mechanics itself ) . to simply postselect out any of alice",
    "s null results would open an inefficient detection loophole in our test .      even though the fsa can not be made for alice",
    ", this does not mean that it is not permissible to postselect on alice getting ( or claiming to get ) a non - null result .",
    "this postselection is permissible as long as the bound @xmath48 in the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : kbound ] ) is adjusted ( to a higher value , naturally ) , to take into account the extra flexibility offered to a dishonest alice if she is allowed to submit null results with a certain probability @xmath49 .",
    "since bob has no way of knowing whether this probability is due to genuine inefficiencies or not , we refer to @xmath50 ( such that @xmath51 ) , as alice s _ apparent efficiency_. alice s optimal cheating strategies , which gives us the new bounds @xmath52 for the post - selected correlation function , were derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , with more details in ref .",
    "the analysis in the remainder of the present paper builds on this , so we briefly review it here .    if alice chooses to submit non - null results only for a predetermined set of @xmath53 measurement settings , with @xmath54 , her optimal @xmath33 is defined by the values of these @xmath53 settings .",
    "such a strategy can be referred to as a _ deterministic _ strategy , and the maximal @xmath30 values obtainable with such a strategy are calculated to be @xmath55 , \\label{eq : platdet}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the apparent efficiency associated with any such strategy , which is necessarily constrained to be @xmath57 .",
    "the sum in the above expression can be over either @xmath0 or @xmath53 settings , since the maximisation over @xmath58 is constrained such that a portion @xmath59 of the @xmath41 values will be nonzero .",
    "an experimental determination of @xmath30 would require many repetitions for each of the @xmath0 settings , and alice is not constrained to choose the same measurements to be null in every iteration , nor even to choose the same number of nulls in every iteration . if alice uses a combination of deterministic strategies ",
    "a _ nondeterministic _ strategy ",
    "she is also able to avoid constraining her apparent efficiency to be @xmath60 .",
    "if using a nondeterministic strategy , the maximal @xmath30 value attainable for any apparent efficiency @xmath50 is @xmath61,\\label{eq : ndbound}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 defines the weighting with which alice uses each deterministic strategy , each of which is defined by its apparent efficiency , @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the sum over @xmath53 indexes all optimal deterministic strategies alice could use ( there is no benefit for alice to ever use suboptimal deterministic strategies , so they are not considered ) .",
    "the weightings @xmath62 are normalised by @xmath64 , and constrained such that @xmath65 .",
    "it can be seen from the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndbound ] ) that @xmath66 .    [ platbound ] the above construction gives the bound a dishonest alice can achieve for the non - postselected correlation function . since she declares non - null results with probability @xmath50 ( which is a quantity bob directly calculates from the statistics of her declared results ) , the bound on the post - selected function @xmath38 will be @xmath67",
    "linear epr - steering criteria of the above form have been studied before , both with the fsa for alice @xcite and without ( i.e. , closing the detection loophole ) @xcite . in all of these works , measurement orientations that are regularly spaced about the bloch sphere were used .",
    "that is , the spacing between vertices is the same for any pair of nearest neighbours .",
    "the only such arrangements that exist are those with 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , or 10 different measurement axes , which correspond to the vertices of the three - dimensional platonic solids ( with the exception of @xmath68 for which the tetrahedron , whose vertices do not come in antipodal pairs , was replaced by the square ) .",
    "regularly spaced measurements are as far apart as it is possible to be from their nearest neighbours on the bloch sphere , and in this sense are as different as possible .",
    "this minimises the ability of alice to choose a state @xmath33 that leads to high values of @xmath69 for many @xmath23 .",
    "intuitively , this seems like a good choice for making it as hard as possible for a cheating alice to obtain high @xmath30 values , thereby making the rigorous epr - steering bounds as low as possible , and thus making it as easy as possible for an honest alice to violate the bound .",
    "it should be noted that this reasoning would not necessarily apply for all kinds of photon polarisation states , as it relies on the symmetry of werner states , which are invariant under identical unitary transformations performed on both sides .",
    "figure [ fig : platonic ] displays the epr - steering bounds calculated from eq .",
    "( [ knep ] ) with measurement orientations defined by platonic solid vertices . looking closely at this graph",
    ", one can observe that the platonic solid measurements for @xmath70 are clearly not optimal in general , since they give a bound above that for @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "an optimal set of four measurements would never require a higher degree of correlation to demonstrate epr - steering than any set of three measurements .",
    "we will return to this issue in sec .",
    "[ sec : globaloptimal ] .",
    ", using platonic solid measurements ( and geodesic measurements , for @xmath8 ) . ]",
    "recall that for a werner state the degree of post - selected correlation @xmath38 is @xmath29 , which can approach unity .",
    "thus we see that for @xmath29 close to one , the bounds @xmath52 are quite loss - tolerant , especially as @xmath0 increases . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath73 , epr - steering is demonstrable so long as @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , in almost all places , use of more measurements results in epr - steering bounds that are more loss - tolerant .",
    "however , regularly spaced measurementsets do not exist for any @xmath0 above 10 , so we must abandon our scheme of using regularly spaced measurements if we wish to use @xmath75 .",
    "but on the other hand , our restriction to regularly spaced measurements was based upon the intuition that they were the best choice for their respective numbers of measurements , whereas this is demonstrably not true everywhere , as discussed above .",
    "therefore , there may be little reason to continue imposing this condition , and little reason to thusly limit our measurement number .",
    "the reader may notice that fig .",
    "[ fig : platonic ] includes not only the platonic solid bounds mentioned above , but also includes a bound for @xmath8 measurements , which can not correspond to any platonic solid .",
    "this was derived , and employed experimentally , in ref .",
    "the measurement orientations used to obtain this bound correspond to the vertices of a shape that incorporates the vertices of the icosahedron ( @xmath76 ) and the dodecahedron ( @xmath77 ) , face - centred on one another ( as these two shapes are a dual pair ) .",
    "the resulting arrangement of vertices creates a shape that is a geodesic solid  each face is an isoceles triangle , so its neighbouring vertices are not regularly spaced , but are quite close to it .",
    "this characteristic is true of any geodesic solid , so given the obvious benefits of using this @xmath8 arrangement , it would seem that geodesic solids are one possible solution for obtaining high-@xmath0 measurement sets with robust bounds .",
    "construction of a geodesic solid does not require two platonic solids to be superimposed , but only requires vertices to be added to the face centres of a platonic solid , or another geodesic solid .",
    "thus , they can not be constructed with arbitrary numbers of vertices , but there does not exist any upper bound upon the number of vertices that can be used to construct one .    having seen that the platonic solids are not necessarily optimal anyway , the fact that the vertices of a geodesic solid are not regularly spaced is not really much of a drawback .",
    "indeed , the viability of geodesic solids may even raise the point of whether a little asymmetry may be more optimal than regularly spaced measurements even for small @xmath0 .",
    "this will be fully explored in sec .",
    "[ sec : globaloptimal ] .",
    "meanwhile , we will use the geodesic solids as a first investigation into the way asymmetry can affect the derivation of epr - steering bounds , enabling more loss - tolerant tests than any previously calculated .",
    "when a cheating alice suspects that bob is keeping track of her null result distribution , her foremost consideration in optimising @xmath38 will be to ensure that this distribution reflects the same profile as that of an honest alice .",
    "this means that alice should ensure the probability of her reporting a null result on any given measurement is equal to the probability of her reporting a null result on any other measurement .",
    "she must do this , even if submitting nulls more often for some measurements would allow her to obtain a higher @xmath30 value .",
    "in other words , if bob does verify that the null rate is independent of alice s supposed setting , then he will be convinced of the reality of epr - steering for a lower @xmath38 value than without this verification , thereby making the test more loss - tolerant .",
    "the uniform spacing of the platonic solids vertices grants them large symmetry groups ; the group of all transformations which leave the polyhedron invariant .",
    "in particular , all vertices are equivalent under the action of each solid s symmetry group .",
    "therefore any cheating strategy alice adopts performs precisely as well if it is symmetrised by application of the symmetry group , and this ensures that the null - rate can be made independent of alice s supposed setting .",
    "for example , when @xmath78 for any of the platonic measurement sets , alice s optimal choice of @xmath79 is any state with its spin axis centred on an edge of the platonic solid ( i.e. , equidistant between any pair of adjacent vertices ) .",
    "such a strategy is equally optimal regardless of which adjacent vertex pair is chosen because all edges are the same length .",
    "but for any geodesic solid , not all edges are the same length , so ( considering @xmath78 again ) not all edge - centres correspond to optimal strategies .",
    "thus , it may not necessarily be possible to use a nondeterministic strategy that both attains the maximal @xmath38 value _ and _ keeps alice s null probabilities equal",
    ". such limitations would be expected to become even more important for the more complicated cheating strategies [ which would be strategies near @xmath80 : the middle of each curve ] .     with and without consideration given to the symmetry condition .",
    "]        for illustration , let us consider the geodesic solid that is constructed by combining the @xmath71 and @xmath70 platonic solid vertices ( because they are dual to one another ) , to obtain @xmath9 . to simply maximise the numerical value of @xmath81 , without constraining her null probabilities for each measurement to be equal , alice can obtain the `` asymmetric '' bound in fig .",
    "[ fig : n7 ] .",
    "if a cheating alice takes care to obey this symmetry condition , then the maximum @xmath82 she can attain is the `` symmetric '' bound in fig .",
    "[ fig : n7 ] .",

    "a clearer plot of the numerical difference between these two bounds is shown later .",

    "the partitions in this figure show the optimal mixture of deterministic strategies by alice , for each possible @xmath50-value .",
    "the height of each partition represents the weighting with which alice must send bob each of the ensembles displayed on the shape within that section , in order to attain the maximal value of @xmath30 . for example , alice s optimal symmetric strategy for @xmath84 requires alice to choose bob s states @xmath33 such that : @xmath85 come from the ensemble shown on the solid labelled ( 0,1 ) , @xmath86 from the ( 1,1 ) solid , and @xmath87 from the ( 1,2 ) solid .",
    "the states in each ensemble must also be submitted equally frequently , e.g. , in this strategy , the eight states on the ( 0,1 ) solid must each be submitted @xmath88 of the time , in total .",

    "although constructed slightly differently , these are the same relations as given in sec .",
    "[ platbound ] . in order for @xmath101 to give the optimal _ symmetric",
    "_ nondeterministic bound , we must also constrain alice s null probability to be independent of bob s measurement orientation .",
    "this can be done by constraining @xmath98 such that the mixing of strategies must be in proportions where , over the entire nondeterministic strategy , the null probability for @xmath71 is equal to that for @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 must also satisfy @xmath102 for both @xmath103 and @xmath104 . without this constraint , the optimal cheating strategies for alice [ those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weighting7](a ) ] would lead to very asymmetric reporting of null results .",
    "for example , at @xmath105 there is a single deterministic strategy ; the @xmath106 strategy , with an apparent efficiency of @xmath107 .",
    "this strategy requires @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which means alice would never report a null result for one of bob s measurements drawn from the cube ( @xmath110 but would report a null result @xmath111 of the time for one drawn from the octahedron ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath9 , a cheating alice is able to attain a symmetric bound almost always as high as her asymmetric bound , but only if she employs more elaborate mixings of her deterministic strategies . indeed , at almost every @xmath50-value , the optimal symmetric mixings include more deterministic strategies than just the strategies used to attain the optimal asymmetric bounds at that @xmath50-value . clearly , only when using two ( or more ) geometrically inequivalent subsets of measurement direction ( as in geodesic solids ) could any cheating strategy attain a higher @xmath81 with an asymmetric null distribution than is possible with a symmetric null distribution .",
    "thus , only when using such inequivalent measurement subsets can a symmetry condition be used to improve our epr - steering bounds ( as we observed for @xmath9 ) . from this observation",
    ", one may come to suspect a further advantage that may be gained in this situation , as follows .",

    "since the symmetry condition requires alice to use an 80:20 ratio of these two strategies , any increase in @xmath114 will thus lower @xmath191 . because @xmath120 does not affect the optimal lhs orientations for ( 2,2 ) or ( 1,4 ) , the optimal value of @xmath114 at @xmath190 is therefore @xmath192 .",
    "this kind of collapse is only possible when the optimal mixture is composed only of strategies with the symmetric characteristics of the ( 2,2 ) and ( 1,4 ) strategies .",
    "this mixture itself is only the optimal one because the differences between the average @xmath112 and @xmath186 results , in both the ( 2,2 ) and ( 1,4 ) strategies , is small enough that even when @xmath192 , there simply does not happen to be any other possible mixture of strategies that can attain as high a value of @xmath193 while still maintaining @xmath190 .",
    "indeed , we can see in fig .",
    "[ comparison7 ] that the improvement at @xmath190 is only about @xmath194 .",
    "thus , this anomaly provides a good example of how strategically unbalanced weightings allow us to optimally utilise a chosen set of geodesic measurements .",

    "thus , for these @xmath50 values , being as far apart as possible ( i.e. , regularly spaced ) is of most importance in a measurement strategy , which is why the platonic measurements are optimal or quite nearly optimal in this range .",
    "a similar principle applies for the minima to the right of the central peak in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , when alice must choose most of her results to be non - null . with non - regularly spaced measurements",
    ", alice can often compose her deterministic strategies for @xmath198 to have non - null arrangements that are more closely spaced than platonic measurements allow ( in a non - regular set of orientations , it s easy to find one or two that are more isolated from the others , whereas in a regular set , this is impossible ) .",
    "the symmetry condition curbs this ability somewhat since it requires each measurement to have the same average non - null probability , but when alice has several @xmath53-values between @xmath199 and @xmath124 ( i.e. , when @xmath0 is large ) , it becomes easier for her to mix these closely spaced high-@xmath53 ( @xmath200 ) strategies with low-@xmath53 strategies that give higher expectation values for the outlying measurements .",
    "this is why the platonic strategies are close to optimal around @xmath173 , and moreso for @xmath76 than @xmath70 .      in this regime ,",
    "alice s optimal strategy is to choose roughly the same number of nulls and non - nulls in each deterministic strategy .",
    "and low-@xmath50 strategies .",
    "however , this would combine the weaknesses of the low-@xmath50 and high-@xmath50 strategies without optimally employing their strengths .",
    "alice s most effective cheating strategies at low @xmath50 are those which maximise bob s results for a minority measurements by disregarding his results for the majority ( which are assigned nulls ) . at high @xmath50 ,",
    "alice s most effective strategies are those which maximise bob s results for as many measurements as possible , with her ability to do so being limited by how many measurements she can afford to assign nulls for ( and therefore not care about their values ) .",
    "choosing roughly the same number of nulls and non - nulls in each deterministic strategy allows her to most effectively prioritise the maximisation of half of bob s measurements over the other half , which she can afford to not care about ( and submit nulls for ) in each deterministic strategy . ] to do this , alice would need to find closely - spaced configurations of @xmath202 measurements to be non - null , and must find such configurations in as many directions as possible .",
    "this task is trivial with platonic measurements , as their symmetry groups are such that a configuration of @xmath53 nearest - neighbour measurements is the same configuration for _ any _ @xmath53 nearest neighbours .",
    "therefore , choosing a set of measurements that are not regularly spaced offers an advantage in this region . for the @xmath70 solid in fig .",
    "[ n4ep5solid ] , for example , every measurement pair is farther apart than the measurement pairs in the cubic arrangement , with the exception of the pair of lowest - weighted measurements .",
    "thus , there is only one pair of measurements that can offer deterministic strategies lower than the cube s , and they have very low weightings .",
    "it is in this way that non - regularity of the optimal measurement sets is easily used to outperform platonic measurement sets .",
    "alice s strategies are most strongly restricted at @xmath124 , where a cheating alice s optimal strategy is to align bob s state with the spatial average of all of his measurement axes , with a suitable choice of sign . for the platonic solids ,",
    "this means choosing ensembles that are either face - centred or vertex - centred all about the platonic solid .",
    "however , optimised measurement strategies for @xmath182 tend to have ( up to @xmath170 , at least ) most of their measurements defining a single plane ( or two parallel planes ) of vertices , and the rest clustered near the directions perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the benefit this offers is that the spatial average(s ) of all of these measurements will be farther from most of them than the platonic averages are from their constituent measurements .",
