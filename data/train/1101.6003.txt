    "one of the outstanding theoretical problems in heavy ",
    "ion physics is a first principles understanding of the isotropization and thermalization of the matter produced in collision .",

    "estimates of the relaxation time range from @xmath1@xmath2 fm @xcite which is hard to accommodate within a simple picture of interacting quasi  particles .",
    "however , a quasi  particle description is not essential to thermalization and in this work we will demonstrate that an initially strong classical field undergoing quantum evolution may evolve in accordance with ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "we will show that the presence of secular divergences ( modes whose occupation number grows with time ) become semi  classical on relatively short time scales and must be resumed to all orders in a standard perturbative expansion .    while this works focuses on scalar @xmath0 theory",
    "it is suggested that similar mechanisms may be at work within the framework of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) description @xcite of high energy nuclei .",
    "work in applying the techniques shown here to the case of classical yang ",
    "mills is currently in progress @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to understand the role secular divergences play in modifying the time evolution of the classical field .",
    "we will demonstrate that the quantum evolution of a scalar field evolves in accordance with ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "finally , we will speculate on the mechanism behind this relaxation by looking at modified spectra and the time evolution of the number density .",
    "this work is largely based off the first paper on this topic",
    "@xcite which we refer the reader to for more details on the resummation scheme .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the resummation of secular diverges is qualitatively similar to the resummation of leading logarithms @xmath3 of the incoming partons momentum fractions required for the computation of inclusive quantities at leading log order @xcite .",
    "these results have proven to be valuable in a quantitative understanding of the near side angular correlations observed in nucleus ",
    "nucleus @xcite and proton ",
    "proton @xcite collisions .",
    "we would like to point out that a considerable amount of work has been done for theories similar to @xmath0 in the context of reheating after inflation @xcite .",
    "in addition , considerable progress has been made on the thermalization problem in the context of heavy ",
    "ion collisions through the use of n  particle irreducible effective actions @xcite .",
    "the cgc inspired scalar theory model has the lagrangian = ( _ ) ( ^ ) - v ( ) + jwhere the interaction potential is v()=^4 and j is an external source which mimics the large @xmath4 color charges of the incoming nuclei .",
    "since the external current vanishes after the collision takes place we take our source to be nonvanishing for @xmath5 only , j(x)~(-x^0 ) .",
    "the role of the external source is to initialize a classical field ( having occupation number @xmath6 ) which evolves solely via their self  interactions at @xmath7 .",
    "this source term also brings an external scale into the problem .",
    "since we assume the source is turned on adiabatically from @xmath8 we can consider the evolution of the classical field as an initial value problem at @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    throughout this work",
    "we will use the same model parameters . in order to avoid confusion we now state these parameters once and for all . for both the homogeneous and non  homogeneous systems we take @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( a very weak coupling considering the factor of @xmath14 in front of the potential ) . for the case of the 3d simulations we employ a @xmath15 lattice with a volume of @xmath15 .",
    "this lattice size will have a momentum cutoff of @xmath16 .",
    "for these model parameters the resonance mode exists between @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "the zero  mode has an effective mass @xmath19 and a period of oscillator of @xmath20 .",
    "in this section we consider a classical background field that is homogeneous in all space and undergoes quantum evolution with space  independent fluctuations ( _ i.e. _ zero  mode fluctuations ) . while highly unrealistic this simple toy model will allow us to see how the mechanism of phase decoherence leads to ideal hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "the lagrangian for a uniform non  expanding scalar theory is = ^2-v ( ) , where @xmath21",
    ". the classical evolution can be found in closed form .",
    "since the energy @xmath22 remains constant throughout the evolution we can write ^2=e_0-v ( ) , [ eq : e0 ] where @xmath23 is the initial energy of the system which is determined by the initial condition of our classical field e_0=_0 ^ 2+_0 ^ 4 . where @xmath24 .",
    "equation [ eq : e0 ] can be integrated to obtain t - t_0=__0^(t ) . at this point",
    "it will be useful to introduce some notation .",
    "let us define ^2g^2/4 !",
    ", and make the change of variables @xmath25 .",
    "we are also free to set @xmath26 for the non  expanding case and we find t=__0^(t ) where ( t)&=&^-1 ( ) + _ 0&=&^-1 ( ) the above integral equation can be solved for @xmath27 in terms of the jacobi elliptic function of the first kind having elliptic modulus @xmath28 .",

    "notice that the period of oscillations depends on the initial conditions through @xmath23 .",
    "the fact that the period of oscillation depends on the initial condition is a signature of non  linear evolution and is crucial for phase decoherence .",
    "it is worth noting that to a very good approximation ( within about 15% ) the above expression for @xmath31 can be approximated by ( t ) , where @xmath32 is a phase set by the initial conditions = .      with an analytic expression for @xmath27 available",
    "we can now find analytic expressions for the stress energy tensor as well .",
    "for the homogeneous non - expanding system there are two independent components of the stress  energy tensor t^00&=&^2+v ( ) + t^ij&=&^ij(^2-v ( ) ) with all other components vanishing . using the expressions derived in the previous section",

    "for this toy model we will treat @xmath35 as a free parameter .",

    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi4_uniform_avg ] for @xmath39 .",
    "the analytic expression is not too enlightening .",

    "[ eq : t ] .",
    "when performing the ensemble average the differing periods of each system results in a phase decoherence forcing the pressure to relax to its equilibrium value .",

    "in this case the period of oscillation will _ not _ depend on the initial condition .",
    "in the previous section we showed how a homogeneous system undergoing zero  mode fluctuations relaxes to a system evolving according to ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "while the previous case is of pedagogical interest since it shows simply how the decoherence of the quantum field leads to the relaxation of the pressure it is highly unrealistic in that it does not include space dependent fluctuations .",
    "we now consider the same model in three dimensions including the space dependent fluctuations as predicted from quantum field theory . in order to motivate the need for the resummation we first discuss the case of linearized perturbations .      in this section",

    "the time scale for relaxation due to the low momentum modes is on the order of that estimated in eq .",
    "[ eq : tauzero ] for the zero  mode .",
    "of course this interpretation is only qualitative .",
    "interactions immediately cause modes which are initially unoccupied to become occupied and the result becomes a complex interplay between many modes which can not be understood simply by studying the linear evolution of individual quanta .",

    "it is clear that as we vary @xmath76 the energy density of the system which is of order @xmath80 varies as well . in order to see the parametric behavior of the relaxation time on @xmath76 at fixed energy density we instead take @xmath81 . in this case",

    "whether these peaks correspond to resonance modes is not clear . even though we know the location of the resonance band at @xmath84 the effective mass of the background field changes with time thereby changing the location of the resonance band with time .",
    "of course , larger lattice simulations will be needed to reinforce these statements . at late times , when the system has fully relaxed , the number density is smooth with a power  law fall off .     and @xmath85 are almost indistinguishable form the spectra at @xmath86 . ]    in fig .",

    "interesting further work might study the late time behavior of the particle number to see if it scales according to kolmogorov turbulence @xcite .     with @xmath88 . ]",
    "in conclusion , it is apparent that quantum fluctuations modify the evolution of a classical scalar theory to the point where it evolves in accordance with ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "we have attempted to understand this behavior by using modified spectra of fluctuations and by studying the particle content of the theory .",
    "we observe that there is a two  stage relaxation process ; the rapid early time relaxation is somehow controlled by modes of intermediate momentum ( at and above the resonance band ) followed by a longer more gradual relaxation which is controlled by the lower momentum ( near zero ) modes .",
