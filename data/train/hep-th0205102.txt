    "particle magnetic moments have provided a valuable test of qed and the standard model . in the magnetic moments of the electron and the muon we have the important situation that both the experimental measurements and the standard model predictions are extremely precise .",
    "additional importance of the muon stems from the fact that it has a larger rest mass than the electron and hence is more sensitive to massive virtual particles and to new physics .",
    "see @xcite for a review of the electron and the muon anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "it was recently found that the complete standard model prediction for the muon magnetic moment differs from the experimentally determined value @xcite by 1.6 standard deviations .",
    "for a nice summary of the experimental and theoretical analyses , as well as history and prospects , see @xcite .",
    "the measured value is expressed as @xmath1 ( assuming cpt invariance ) where @xmath2 .",
    "the standard model prediction is @xmath3 .",
    "there are many possible extensions of the standard model which may contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "for example , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , higher dimensional kaluza - klein theories @xcite , as well as theories based on heretofore undiscovered interactions @xcite , are all of this type .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a new interaction involving an antisymmetric tensor field which we present as a potential solution to the @xmath4 discrepancy .",
    "the kalb - ramond antisymmetric tensor field @xcite is encountered in string theory @xcite and also arises in some theories of gravity with torsion @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the antisymmetric tensor to the anomalous magnetic moment occurs at one - loop order due to the kalb - ramond  fermion vertex .",
    "the feynman diagram for this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ moment ] .    consider the following lagrangian @xcite : @xmath5 the factor of @xmath6 denotes a mass scale to make the coupling constant , @xmath7 , dimensionless .",
    "we assume that the antisymmetric torsion , or kalb - ramond antisymmetric tensor field , @xmath8 , can be derived from a potential ( i.e. @xmath9 is exact ) @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and @xmath12    to find the propagator for the antisymmetric tensor field requires adding a gauge fixing term to the free lagrangian density @xmath13   b^{\\nu \\lambda } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a gauge fixing parameter .",
    "we use the antisymmetry of @xmath15 and substitute @xmath16 to arrive at the momentum space expression @xmath17   b^{\\nu \\lambda}.\\ ] ]    our gauge invariant propagator for the antisymmetric tensor field is the inverse of the quantity in brackets directly above and reads : @xmath18 \\ .\\ ] ] with the gauge choice @xmath19 this reduces to @xmath20    the vertex rule for the coupling of the antisymmetric tensor field to a spin-@xmath21 dirac field is extracted from the interaction part of the lagrangian @xmath22 substituting the definitions ( [ defs1 ] ) into this gives @xmath23 \\psi \\\\ & \\equiv -\\frac{g}{m } \\overline{\\psi } \\ ; \\lambda^{\\alpha \\beta } \\ ; \\psi   \\ ; b_{\\alpha \\beta}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] our vertex rule in momentum space is then seen to be @xmath24 where the momentum @xmath25 is that carried by the kalb - ramond field @xmath15 .",
    "the corrections to the magnetic moment are due to exchanges of virtual particles which affect the measured value of the photon - fermion coupling . here",
    "we specialize to the case of muons .",
    "the qed prediction is ( to 5 loops ) @xcite : @xmath26 which differs in the 5th significant figure from the experimental value .",
    "the electroweak corrections to the vertex amount to ( to 2 loops ) @xcite : @xmath27    there is yet another standard model correction .",
    "it is when the first muon emits a photon which is energetic enough to produce quark anti - quark pairs which then annihilate into another photon absorbed by the final state muon .",
    "this hadronic correction to the moment is computed two separate ways  with results which are in agreement  ( to 3 loops ) @xcite : @xmath28 we must note that this is very difficult to calculate and that it contributes the greatest amount of uncertainty in the total standard model prediction .",
    "so the complete standard model prediction is then :    @xmath29    we now see that this differs from experiment in the 6th digit , which is much better than the pure qed calculation .",
    "the current standard model calculation differs from the latest experimental results and is outside of the experimental error bars .",
    "this motivates a search for sources beyond the standard model that may help to resolve the discrepancy .",
    "we can use the feynman rules derived in section  [ rules ] to find the contribution of the antisymmetric tensor field to fermion anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "this may place a useful bound on the fermion - antisymmetric tensor coupling .",

    "it should be noted that our bound on @xmath55 given in ( [ newcoupling ] ) translates into a bound of @xmath56 . ]",

    "this simple coupling makes no distinction between the fermion families and hence it must have effect on the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the tau .",
    "the electron anomalous magnetic moment is given in @xcite as @xmath58 with our upper bound for the coupling , the kalb - ramond contribution to the electron s magnetic moment is @xmath59 which is well within the experimental error .",
    "the experimental value for the tau anomaly is not very precisely known at present and the effect of the antisymmetric tensor interaction , while approximately 300 times larger than in the muon case , is expected to be unverifiable in the near future .",
    "we have found that the interaction between a fermion and an antisymmetric tensor field such as the one arising in string theory and in einstein - cartan gravity can solve the problem with the muon anomalous magnetic moment without having a significant affect on the electron anomalous magnetic moment if the antisymmetric tensor coupling satisfies the bound ( [ newcoupling ] ) .",
    "there are many other possible contributions , beyond the standard model , to the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the most favoured candidates are supersymmetric partners to the standard model spectrum @xcite .",
    "if these other particles are indeed found then the bound on the kalb - ramond  fermion coupling would become stronger ."
