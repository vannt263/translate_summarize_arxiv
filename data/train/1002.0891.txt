    "the discovery of ferro - pnictide superconductors has set a new and unforseen direction in the search for high - temperature superconductivity.@xcite a common structural feature of these materials are square lattices of iron atoms that are stacked up on top of each other.@xcite density functional theory ( dft ) calculations find that the iron 3d orbitals contribute most of the electronic spectral weight near the fermi surface.@xcite@xmath3@xcite this implies that the iron @xmath4 electrons surprisingly play an active role in the superconductivity . in contrast , dft calculations also predict that the iron moments order antiferromagnetically along the @xmath5 and along the @xmath6 axes of the iron lattice at low temperature in the undoped parent compounds,@xcite with an ordered moment of approximately @xmath7 bohr magnetons ( @xmath8).@xcite elastic neutron diffraction studies have confirmed the prediction of long - range commensurate spin - density wave ( csdw ) order , but they find a much lower ordered moment that can be a small fraction of the bohr magneton ( @xmath9 ) in some cases.@xcite it was suggested early on that heisenberg exchange between both nearest - neighbor ( @xmath0 ) and next - nearest neighbor ( @xmath1 ) spins on a square lattice of iron atoms could account for the low ordered moment that is observed because of magnetic frustration .",
    "recent calculations based on the linear spin - wave approximation@xcite indicate that this effect requires fine tuning however,@xcite and that it occurs only very close to the point of maximum frustration , @xmath10 .",

    "observable low - energy spin - wave excitations due to hidden order that are centered at zero momentum are also predicted by the linear spin - wave approximation , but these have very small spectral weight .",

    "they notably account for the dispersion of the low - energy spinwaves centered at the csdw wave numbers and for the local maximum that exists at the wavenumber associated with nel order .",

    "recent low - temperature measurements of the optical conductivity in the csdw phase of parent compounds to ferro - pnictide high-@xmath14 superconductors find a strong suppression of the integrated kinetic energy for the conduction electrons compared to that predicted by electronic band - structure calculations.@xcite a low carrier density in the csdw phase of ferro - pnictide materials is consistent with quantum - oscillation experiments@xcite@xmath11@xcite and with angle - resolved photoemission studies@xcite that find evidence for tiny 2d fermi - surface `` spots '' , each on the order of 1% of the brillouin zone .",
    "also , the dependence on temperature shown by the electrical resistance of such parent compounds indicates proximity to a metal - insulator transition.@xcite undoped ferro - pnictide materials in the csdw phase then may very well lie near a mott transition , where conduction electrons experience moderately strong repulsive interactions . by continuity with the limit of strong inter - electron repulsion",
