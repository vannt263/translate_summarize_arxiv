    "the intricate character of financial markets has been one of the main motives for the physicists interest in the study of their statistical and dynamical properties  @xcite . besides the asymptotic power - law behaviour for probability density function for price fluctuations , _ the return _ , and the long - lasting correlations in the absolute return , another important statistical feature observed is the return multi - fractal nature  @xcite .",
    "this propriety has been important in the establishment of analogies between price fluctuations and fluid turbulence  @xcite and the development of multiplicative cascade models for return dynamics too  @xcite .",
    "changes in the price of a certain equity are basically related transactions of that equity .",
    "so , the _ traded volume _ , which is defined as the number of stocks that change hands during some period of time , is an important observable in the dynamics of financial markets .",
    "this observation is confirmed by an old proverb at old street that `` it takes volume to make prices move ''  @xcite .    in previous works several proprieties of traded volume , @xmath0 , either statistical or dynamical have been studied  @xcite . in this article , we present a study of the multi - fractal structure of @xmath1-minute traded volume time series of the @xmath2 equities which are used to compose the dow jones industrial average , dj30 .",
    "our series run from the @xmath3 of july until the @xmath4 december of @xmath5 with a length of around @xmath6 elements each .",
    "the analysis is done using the multi - fractal detrended fluctuation analysis , mf - dfa - order polynomials . from this order",
    "ahead , we have a nearly polynomial - order - independent multi - fractal spectrum , contrarly to what happens with fitting polynomials of smaller order . ]  @xcite . besides the multi - fractral analysis we weight the influence of correlation , asymptotic power - law distribution and non - linearities in the multi - fractality of traded volume .",
    "since we are dealing with intra - day series we have to be cautious with the well - known daily pattern which is often considered as a lacklustre propriety@xcite .",
    "to that , we have removed that intra - day pattern of the original time series and normalised each element of the series by its mean value defining the normalised traded volume , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is defined as the average over time ( @xmath11 represents the intra - day time and @xmath12 the day ) .",
    "a common signature of complexity in a system is the existence of ( asymptotic ) scale invariance in several typical quantities .",
    "this scale invariance , self - affinity for time series , can be associated to a single type of structure , characterised by a single exponent , @xmath13 ( the hurst exponent ) or by a composition of several sub - sets , each one with a certain local exponent , @xmath14 , and all supported onto a main structue .",
    "the former is defined as a _ mono - fractal _ and the latter as a _ multi - fractal_. in this case the statistical proprieties of the various sub - sets are characterised by the local exponents @xmath14 are related with a fractal dimension @xmath15@xcite composing the _ multi - fractal spectrum_. to evaluate , numerically , this function we have applied the mf - dfa method  @xcite . for this procedure",
    "it was proved that the @xmath16-th order fluctuation function , @xmath17 , presents scale behaviour @xmath18 .",
    "the correspondence between mf - dfa and the standard formalism of multifractals is obtained by , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the exponent of the generalised partition function . from legendre",
    "transform , @xmath21 , we can relate @xmath20 with the hlder exponent  @xcite , @xmath14 .",
    "thus , using the previous equation we get @xmath22 + 1.\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig](left ) we display the @xmath15 spectrum ( full line ) obtained from averages for each @xmath16 over the values of the @xmath2 companies . in our analysis",
    "@xmath16 runs from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "we have verified that @xmath15 presents a wide range of exponents from @xmath25 up to @xmath26 , corresponding to a deep multi - fractal behaviour .",
    "for @xmath27 we have obtained @xmath28 which agrees with strong persistence previously observed  @xcite .",
    "_ vs. _ @xmath29 .",
    "right panel : scaling exponents @xmath30 .",
    "_ vs. _ @xmath16 averaged over the @xmath2 companies .",
    "the legend on the right is also valid for the left .",
    "the `` original '' and shuffled time series present a strong multi - fractal character , while the shuffled plus phase randomised time series presents a narrow width in @xmath14 related with the almost linear dependence of @xmath31 and also with the strong contribution of non - gaussian pdf of traded volume to multi - fractality . ]    from our time series we can define new and related ones that can help us to quantify which factors contribute the most to the multi - fractal character of this observable . among these factors we name : linear correlations , non - linear correlations and power - law - like pdf .",
    "to that , we have shuffled the elements ( within each time series ) and from these series we have computed @xmath32 . from these uncorrelated time series",
    "we have created another set by randomising the phase in the fourier space .",
    "afterwards , we have applied the inverse fourier transform to come back to the time variable .",
    "these new series have gaussian stationary distribution and scaling exponent @xmath33 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig](left ) we see that these two series also present multi - fractal spectrum , although the shuffle series has a wider spectrum than the shuffled plus phase randomised series . concerning the hurst exponent , @xmath34 , we have obtained @xmath35 for shuffled and @xmath36 for shuffled plus phase randomised series .",
    "considering error margins , these values are compatible with @xmath37 of brownian motion .",
    "furthermore , we have made a set of only phase randomised time series for which we have obtained @xmath38 . from this values",
    "we have concluded that correlations have a key role in the persistent character of traded volume time series .",
    "using @xmath39 scaling relation for the three series @xcite and assuming that all the factors are independent , we can quantify the influence of correlations , @xmath40 , the influence of a non - gaussian pdf , @xmath41 , and the weight of non - linearities , @xmath42 .",
    "the multi - fractality of a time series can be analysed by mens of the difference of values between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , hence @xmath45 it is a suitable way to characterise multi - fractality . for a mono - fractal",
    "we have @xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. _ , linear dependence of @xmath47 with @xmath16 . in fig .",
    "[ fig](right )  we have depicted @xmath47 for several time series from which we have computed the various @xmath48 .",
    "the results obtained are the following : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "as it can be easily concluded the influence of linear correlations in traded volume muli - fractal nature is minimal with @xmath53 corresponding to @xmath54 of @xmath48 .",
    "this value is substancially smaller than the influence of @xmath55 which corresponds to @xmath56 of @xmath48 .",
    "our result is in perfect accordance with another previous result of us @xcite where , using a non - extensive generalised mutual information measure  @xcite , we were able to show that non - linear dependences are not only stronger but also more resilient than linear dependences ( correlations ) in traded volume time series .",
    "last but not least , from the values of @xmath48 we have verified that the main factor for the multi - fractality of traded volume time series is its non - gaussian , generalised @xmath16-gamma  @xcite , probability density function with a weight of @xmath57 in @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , we have verified that the behaviour of @xmath20 for @xmath58 is quite different from the @xmath59 , which is also visible in the strong asymmetry of @xmath15 .",
    "this could indicate that large and small fluctuations appear due to different dynamical mechanisms .",
    "such scenario is consistent with the super - statistical  @xcite approach recently presented  vol - smdq , vol - dumas and closely related with the current non - extensive framework based on _ tsallis entropy _  @xcite . within this context and bearing in mind",
    "the relation @xmath60  @xcite , we conjecture that , for traded volume , the sensivity to inicial conditions may be described by @xmath61^{\\frac{1}{1-q_{sens}}}$ ] with @xmath62 .",
