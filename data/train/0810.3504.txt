    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp , denoted by @xmath2 ) are the leading candidates for cold dark matter ( cdm)@xcite . there are intense experimental efforts to look for wimps through direct detection of nuclear recoils in @xmath2n@xmath3@xmath2n elastic scattering or in the studies of the possible products through @xmath4 annihilations .",
    "supersymmetric(susy ) particles are the leading wimp candidates .",
    "the popular susy models prefer wimp mass(@xmath5 ) in the range of @xmath6100  gev , though light neutralinos remain a possibility@xcite .",
    "most experimental programs optimize their design in the high - mass region and exhibit diminishing sensitivities for @xmath7 , where an allowed region due to the annual modulation data of the dama experiment@xcite further reinforced by the first dama / libra results@xcite remains unprobed .",
    "simple extensions of the standard model with a singlet scalar favors light wimps .",
    "detectors with sub - kev threshold are needed for probing this low - mass region and studying wimps bound in the solar system , and non - pointlike susy candidates like q - balls .",
    "this presents a formidable challenge to both detector technology and background control .",
    "we report the first results in an attempt towards such goals@xcite .",
    "ultra - low - energy germanium detectors(ulege ) is a matured technique for sub - kev soft x - rays measurements .",
    "compared with @xmath8 which also has set limits@xcite at the sub - kev threshold , ge provides enhancement in @xmath2n spin - independent couplings(@xmath9 ) due to the @xmath10 dependence@xcite , where a is the mass number of the target isotopes .",
    "in addition , the isotope @xmath11ge ( natural isotopic abundance of 7.73% ) comprises an unpaired neutron such that it can provide additional probe to the spin - dependent couplings of wimps with the neutrons(@xmath12 ) .",
    "the nuclear recoils from @xmath2n interactions in ulege only give rise to @xmath620% of the observable ionizations compared with electron recoils at the same energy . for clarity ,",
    "all ulege measurements discussed hereafter in this article are electron - equivalent - energy , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the ulege array consists of 4-element each having an active mass of 5  g@xcite .",
    "standard ultra - low - background specifications were adopted in its construction and choice of materials .",
    "the low background measurement was performed at the kuo - sheng(ks ) laboratory@xcite with an overburden of about 30  meter - water - equivalence .",
    "a background level of @xmath13(cpkkd ) at 20  kev , comparable with those of underground cdm experiments , was achieved in a previous experiment with a 1-kg hpge detector@xcite for the studies of neutrino magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "details of the detector and shielding components can be refereed to ref .",
    "energy calibration was achieved by the external @xmath14fe sources(5.90 and 6.49  kev ) together with x - rays from ti(4.51 and 4.93  kev ) , ca(3.69  kev ) , and s(2.31  kev ) in figure  [ fe55 ] .",
    "the rt - events provided the calibration point at zero - energy .",
    "the rms resolutions for the rt - events and @xmath14fe peaks were about 55  ev and 78  ev , respectively .",
    "the ulege signals were distributed to two spectroscopy amplifiers at 6  @xmath15s(@xmath16 ) and 12  @xmath15s(@xmath17 ) shaping times and with different amplification factors . pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) software@xcite was devised to differentiate physics events from those due to electronic noise , exploiting the correlations in both the energy and timing information of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 signals in figure  [ psd_2d ] .",
    "calibration events and those from physics background were overlaid , indicating uniform response .",
    "events selected by psd but with anti - compton veto ( acv ) and cosmic - ray veto ( crv ) tags were subsequently rejected .",
    "the surviving events were ulege signals uncorrelated with other detector systems and could be wimp candidates .",
    "the data set adopted for the wimp analysis has a daq live time of 0.338  kg - day .",
    "the daq dead time is 11% .",
    "the crv and acv selection efficiencies of , respectively , 91.4% and 98.3% were accurately measured using rt - events@xcite .",
    "the trigger efficiencies depicted in figure  [ eff ] correspond to the fractions of the distributions above the discriminator threshold level .",
    "events in coincidence with acv - tags are mostly physics - induced .",
    "the fraction of these events surviving the psd cuts represents the psd efficiency .",
    "alternatively , the deviations of the psd - selected events from a flat distribution in the low energy portion of @xmath14fe calibration spectrum of figure  [ fe55 ] provided the second measurement .",
    "consistent results were obtained with both approaches , as depicted in figure  [ eff ] .",
    "the efficiencies and their uncertainties adopted for analysis were derived from a best - fit on the combined data set .",
    "a threshold of ( 220@xmath010 )  ev was achieved with a psd efficiency of 50% .",
    "the ulege spectrum normalized in cpkkd unit after the crv , acv and psd selections is displayed in figure  [ bkgspect ] , showing comparable background as cresst - i@xcite .",
    "the formalisms followed those of ref .",
    "@xcite using standard nuclear form factors , a galactic rotational velocity of @xmath18 and a local wimp density of @xmath19 with maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "the unbinned optimal interval method as formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite and widely used by current cdm experiments was adopted to derive the upper limits for the possible @xmath2n event rates .",
    "corrections due to qf , detector resolution and various efficiency factors were incorporated .",
    "the energy dependence of qf in ge was evaluated with the trim software package@xcite .",
    "exclusion plots on both @xmath20 and @xmath21 planes at 90% confidence level for galactically - bound wimps were then derived , as depicted in figures  [ explotsindep ] and [ explotsdep ] , respectively .",
    "the dama - allowed regions@xcite and the current exclusion boundaries@xcite are displayed .",
    "the `` model - independent '' approach of refs .",
    "@xcite were adopted to extract limits on the spin - dependent cross - sections .",
    "consistent results were obtained when different @xmath11ge nuclear physics matrix elements@xcite were adopted as input .",
    "the parameter space probed by the @xmath11ge in ulege is complementary to that of the cresst - i experiment@xcite where the @xmath22al target is made up of an unpaired proton instead .",
    "new limits were set by the ks - ulege data in both @xmath9 and @xmath12 for @xmath5@xmath63@xmath16  gev .",
    "the remaining dama low-@xmath5 allowed regions in both interactions were probed and excluded .",
    "the observable nuclear recoils at @xmath5=5  gev and @xmath23=@xmath24(allowed ) and @xmath25(excluded ) are superimposed with the measured spectrum in the inset of figure  [ bkgspect ] for illustrations .",
    "it is expected that recent data from the coupp@xcite experiment can place further constraints in the spin - dependent plots of figures  [ explotsdep ] .",
    "this work extends the bounds on wimps by making measurements in a new observable window of 100  ev@xmath11  kev in a low - background environment .",
    "understanding and suppression of background at this sub - kev region is crucial for further improvement .",
    "there are recent advances in `` point - contact '' ge detector@xcite which offer potentials of scaling - up the detector mass to the kg - range .",
    "the mass - normalized external background will be reduced in massive detectors due to self - attenuation@xcite .",
    "the potential reach of full - scale experiments with 1  kg - year of data and a benchmark background level of 1  cpkkd is illustrated in figures  [ explotsindep ] and [ explotsdep ] .",
    "such experimental programs are complementary to the many current efforts on cdm direct searches .",
