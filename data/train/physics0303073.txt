    "the minimization of diffraction effects from wave fields in the focal plane has been proposed for microwaves by schelkunoff  @xcite and for light by toraldo di francia  @xcite but with little practical advantage , since the non - diffracting portion of the field was very faint , surrounded by giant side lobes , apart from the enormous practical difficulties of creating the phase and amplitude changes in the aperture plane  @xcite .",
    "more recently durnin  @xcite has demonstrated that a @xmath0 field will have a non - diffracting component , but again the beam , originally emitted by an annular aperture , is faint and of limited extension , with most of the radiation dissipated in the side lobes .",
    "tamari  @xcite has qualitatively described a method to totally cancel diffraction effects ( de - diffraction , or dd ) from any wave field utilizing the radiation from the full aperture which can be focused to a sharp point , or non - diverging beam . in this paper dd",
    "will be derived from first principles in terms of the wave equation and the concept of the reversal of the field .",
    "while dd fields are of most interest in electromagnetic or acoustic applications such as in super - resolving imaging or in non - divergent beams , the method is quite general and can be adopted to any flow - field whether it is a wave field or not , and even to electrostatic and gravitational potential fields if the concept of streamline concentration is used instead of dd .",
    "however , for the purposes or this paper the language of monochromatic electromagnetic fields will be used , since it is in such cases that diffraction effects have been studied most thoroughly in optical and microwave applications .    in section  ii , dd fields will be defined and shown to be theoretically possible solutions to the differential wave equation . although it is possible to proceed directly to de - diffraction theory by field reversal in section  v , the related concepts of streamlined flow and vorticity will be used in section  iii to describe the transformation of a geometrical field to a diffracted field , illustrated by kirchhoff s derivation of the diffraction integral . in section",
    "iv a ` bow wavelet ' or dipole model will be examined , supplanting that of the fresnel - huygens wavelet , the better to describe the field in the immediate vicinity of the aperture , the crucial area where the diffraction process is both initiated and from which it could be cancelled .",
    "some dd experimental results will be described in section  vi and practical applications of the method discussed in section  vii .",
    "the surprising implications of dd theory as far as both quantum and general relativity theories are concerned will be discussed in section  viii and the paper is summarized in section  ix .",

    "the field is said to have normal rectilinear congruence and for our purposes here such a field can be termed a geometrical  @xcite field but _ without _ the usual restriction that the wavelength @xmath6 , usually understood by the term .",
    "this duplication of terms has been made on purpose since apart from the wavelength the fields above obey all the laws of optics and are infinite waves which fill all of space .",
    "current flows in open water are examples of such smooth fields . if the field s intensity varies in time , some examples would be an infinite acoustic or electromagnetic plane wave or a spherical wave emitted by a point source @xmath7 when the fields are characterized by an even intensity function across equipotential surfaces ( the wavefronts ) to which @xmath4 are always normal .",

    "such a wave is , theoretically also a solution because in @xmath9 the wave @xmath11 is also a solution of eq .",
    "this trivial mathematical truth will have great significance when translated to dd physics . in this field , @xmath4 are straight lines and so within @xmath8 , @xmath1 constitutes a well - defined geometrical wave . since energy , by definition ,",
    "does not cross streamlines , @xmath8 constitutes a ` flux tube '  @xcite carrying the field s total energy without any loss whatsoever .",
    "@xmath8 is a non - diffracting field .",
    "it is important to stress that the border between @xmath8 and @xmath9 does not form a physical barrier to restrain or reflect the waves , such as the walls of a waveguide  @xcite nor is there any discontinuity in the medium between @xmath8 and @xmath9 such as a change in the index of refraction : quite simply the amplitude of the waves just drops to zero in certain regions @xmath9 .",
    "although mathematically possible , such truncated non - diffracting fields do not ordinarily exist in nature  @xcite : the moment any attempt is made to truncate an infinite field by placing in its path an opaque screen with an open aperture forming a cross - section of @xmath8 , the field streamlines @xmath4 automatically swerve behind the screen , slow down near the edge and cause interference effects with regions of zero and maximum intensities , and transform the whole field topologically in a typical diffraction pattern .",
    "the field now spreads to fill all of space anew , but now no longer as a geometrical field .",
    "similarly , if the field is emitted from an infinite number of point sources arrayed in an aperture @xmath8 , it diffracts as if a plane wave had passed normally through an open aperture @xmath8 .    ( a )  truncated plane wave super - focused at f , and its spike - like intensity function .",

    "the  diffraction limits \" now used as a measure of quality in focusing instruments and beams , and which depend on the wavelength , and inversely on the aperture diameter , would cease to have any significance .",
    "in hydrodynamics , @xmath12    is known as the vorticity of the field : it is the measure of how much the field curves around during its flow . when @xmath13 as in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] , the field is then said to be irrotational  @xcite and the vorticity is the same on all of @xmath4 .",
    "when such geometrical fields are interrupted or disturbed by a physical obstacle , however , the field acquires vorticity around the edges of the aperture , with @xmath4 curving into the shadow regions .",
    "this is easy to understand by considering sound waves ` turning ' and being heard behind the corner of a building .",
    "similarly , in hydro- and aerodynamics , obstacles such as the aperture edge can create wakes , vortices and other deviations from geometrical flow  @xcite . in wave fields where @xmath14 it is more common to describe these changes as diffraction effects , but in fact i have attempted to show that the two classes of phenomena are closely linked  @xcite .",
    "an extensive description of the electromagnetic field s angular momentum , using hydrodynamical concepts has been made by d.  ximing  @xcite .",

    "( right )  a huygens - fresnel wavelet.,width=325 ]     a geometrical field diffracts.,width=325 ]    why do these transformations occur ?",
    "there is always _",
    "matter _ at the edge of a source or an obstacle , where diffraction starts forming . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the angle @xmath15 which * s * makes with the normal ( the original direction of propagation rotates by @xmath16 or more at the edge . adjoining * s * follow suit in a domino effect of decreasing @xmath15 until the mainstream @xmath4 at the center of a symmetrical aperture is reached , where @xmath17 .",
    "this curvature of @xmath4 around an edge is clearly illustrated by plots of the streamlines and the ellipsoidal wavefronts normal to them , made by braunbeck and laukien@xcite based on sommerfeld s  @xcite rigorous solution of the infinite half - plane diffraction problem .",
    "this solution also provides another way of visualizing vorticity around the aperture edge : the concept of a cylindrical wave emitted by the edge , and interfering with the geometrical field to create the diffracted field .",
    "this analysis alternatively gives the diffracted field as an integration of an infinite spectrum of plane waves emitted from the aperture at angles @xmath15 rotating through @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "this lends itself naturally to the following physical interpretation : an infinite number of streamlines normal to the aperture make up the original zero - order geometrical field approaching from the @xmath19 region .",
    "diffraction bends these @xmath4 into an infinite number of streamlines each at a different @xmath15 , to make up the fourier orders ( @xmath20 ) of the field in the @xmath21 region  @xcite .",
    "kirchhoff s theory of diffraction  @xcite , although less rigorous than that of sommerfeld  @xcite provides the perfect theoretical framework for demonstrating the transformation of a geometrical field into a diffracted one and then , as shown below , back to a de - diffracted field .",
    "a point source @xmath7 on the @xmath19 axis in fig .",
    "4 emits a geometrical spherical wave  @xcite whose @xmath4 coincide with the radii centered on @xmath7 .",
    "this wave then passes through an aperture @xmath22 in an infinite opaque screen and centered on the @xmath23 plane , and spreads throughout the @xmath21 portion of space , creating the typical maxima and minima observed on a screen @xmath24 placed normal to the @xmath25-axis at some distance from the aperture .",
    "kirchhoff s method is based on potential theory and is both inaccurate in the vicinity of the edges @xmath26 and noncommittal on the _ path _ the field s energy takes from @xmath7 to @xmath24",
    ". however , the bending of the streamlines into the shadow regions and the transformation of the geometrical wavefront @xmath27 into the elliptical wavefronts @xmath28 is also quite clear in the rigorous solutions mentioned above  @xcite .    a typical flux tube @xmath29 carries energy from @xmath7 to @xmath30 in the aperture plane along a straight line .",
    "but in the @xmath21 region it curves towards the shadow regions behind the obstacle , crossing a typical wavefront @xmath31 at @xmath32 and creating point @xmath33 in the diffraction pattern on @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath29 acts like a channel of a given capacity  @xcite , carrying energy from @xmath34 to @xmath33 .",
    "this idea is confirmed by helmholtz reciprocity ( or reversion ) theorem  @xcite whereby `` a point source at @xmath7 will produce at @xmath33 the same effect as a point source of equal intensity placed at @xmath33 will produce at @xmath7 '' .",
    "when @xmath7 is moved down on the axis to @xmath35 the geometrical field in the @xmath19 regions becomes an infinite plane wave arriving normally at @xmath22 .",
    "the aspect of kirchhoff s integral that is of interest here is that the diffracted field reduces to an integration of huygens - fresnel ( hf )  @xcite wavelets emitted by point sources on @xmath22",
    ". it will be axiomatic to extend this idea to say that a _ ray _ from @xmath7 reaches the aperture plane at a _ point _",
    "@xmath36 ( a source anywhere on the aperture ) and is transformed into the ` exploding ' diffracted pattern of the hf wavelet of fig .  3 with its inclination factor adjusting the amplitude by @xmath37 ; but this is known to be only an approximation .",
    "since the precise determination of the wavefronts near the aperture is an essential first step in the implementation of dd theory , an attempt will now be made to examine the wavelet more closely .",
    "a pebble is dropped in a pond and a circular ripple results .",
    "but when an atom emits a photon , or when a point element of a field is examined , there is radial momentum but no backward momentum such as in the hf wavelet .",
    "recently miller  @xcite starting out with the wave equation derived a `` spatio - temporal dipole '' field for the fundamental electromagnetic wavelet .",
    "this confirmed my independent intuitive derivation  @xcite adapting the model of a bow wave such as that made by a boat  @xcite : a stationary atom releases a photon having both radial and foreword velocities @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the bow wave or dipole pattern of fig .  3 emerges .",
    "that some such process is at work is suggested by the case of cerenkov radiation , where a fast - moving electron in glass creates a v - shaped wake of light  @xcite . in free space , however , since @xmath40 the center @xmath41 of the bow waves circular wavefronts @xmath42 , travels up the @xmath21 axis at the same rate as the radius @xmath43 expands , and the v - shaped ` shock - wave ' now opens up to become a straight line along the @xmath44-axis .",
    "this pattern is also confirmed in the literature , where the streamlines of a dipole  @xcite are similar to such circles centered along the @xmath44-axis .",
    "but on this axis , apart from the origin , the field is zero since the contributing wavefronts there would have an infinite radius .",
    "the circular streamlines of the bow wavelet provide a natural explanation for the vorticity of the field at the edge of the aperture .",
    "in addition the bow wave s wavelength @xmath45 is @xmath46 only in the propagation direction ( unlike the hf wavelet which has only amplitude changes with @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath45 explains the very rapid fluctuations of the diffracted field very near the edge  @xcite .",
    "this discussion of the primary wavelets of a field is to establish a method to derive the mathematically exact form of the extended wavefronts near the aperture , in order to make dd precise . in section",
    "vi experiments will be described that show that the bow wave and the ray that creates it can also have a real physical existence of their own .",
    "it has been long known that electromagnetic fields are time invariant  @xcite : any solution @xmath47 of maxwell s equations will have an equivalent solution @xmath48 since replacing @xmath49 with @xmath50 , and hence @xmath51 with @xmath52 will lead to the same wave equation eq .",
    "examples of this are spherical waves and plane waves whose complete solutions show identical waves travelling with opposite velocities @xmath53 , for example the plane wave @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "time invariance here need not involve any philosophical considerations of the arrow of time , merely that the field retains all its point values when the velocity direction is reversed by rotating all its * s * by @xmath18 . the principle of reversibility along rays has also been derived from fermat s principle  @xcite .    in optics",
    "this principle of reversibility is implicit in any imaging situation where a point object and its image can be interchanged , and in the theory of holography  @xcite . with this in mind",
    "consider two typical situations where diffraction occurs : first the isolated bow wavelet of fig .",
    "a straight ray is scattered at a point @xmath36 and then branches into streamlines , creating any of the diffracted wave fronts @xmath55 now imagine that a curved mirror shaped as one of the wavefronts say @xmath56 , is placed to overlap that wavefront exactly .",
    "since all the diffracted streamlines are then normal to the mirror the * s * vectors are reflected back on themselves , and since amplitude and phase are preserved ( phase changes upon reflection will be uniform across @xmath42 ) then the field will reverse itself along the same streamlines , and passing point @xmath36 on the return trip , ends up as a single ray in the @xmath19 direction ( but without the original source of the ray there ) . alternately , instead of a mirror",
    "think that @xmath56 now consists of an infinite array of point sources with an identical amplitude function to that of the original diffracted pattern on @xmath56 . in the @xmath21 direction",
    "the field will continue to diffract exactly as before . but below @xmath56 in the @xmath19 direction the sources on @xmath56 will recombine to create a reversing ray .",
    "the second case is that of an extended field passing through an aperture , for example the diffraction situation of fig .",
    "de - diffraction ( dd ) by reversal of a diffracted wavefront.,width=226 ]    here again any one of the wavefronts @xmath42 of fig .",
    "4 can serve as a source for the reverse dd field , or to reflect an already diffracted field . as a result of these procedures ,",
    "the curved streamlines @xmath57 of the reversing field emerge from the aperture @xmath22 normally as a part of a dediffracted truncated geometrical field .",
    "if diffraction is to be likened to a topological distortion of an ordinary field , the reverse process can be said to start with a purposely distorted field to produce an ordinary one .",
    "it might be argued that the presence of an opaque screen @xmath58 reflecting or absorbing portions of the original @xmath19 field will necessitate the placement of a similar screen when dd is attempted .",
    "such a screen is not needed for dd however , because the diffracted field immediately touching the screen from the @xmath21 side will be negligible or zero ; indeed that the field is zero on the screen is one of the boundary conditions in kirchhoff s derivation  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "when the original source is an infinite array of point sources along @xmath22 , no screen @xmath58 need be present in the diffracting field , and none will be needed in the reversing field , only the conceptual removal of the original sources on @xmath22 to allow the dd field to emerge .",
    "choosing the wavefronts as the source for a dd field insures that the phase is the same there , simplifying the design of the lenses or antennas to be used to create a dd field .",
    "however in principle _ any _ linear ( or surface in the 3d case ) array @xmath24 of sources spanning the diffracted field and mimicking its local phase and amplitude can be used to create the dd field .",
    "for example an infinite array of sources having the ring - shaped phase and amplitude pattern of the electric field of the airy function  @xcite , and placed in the focal plane of a lens will cause a reverse dd field to emerge from the lens .",
    "this method greatly resembles the zone - plate - type filter described by toraldo di francia to achieve superresolution  @xcite . of course",
    ", in any practical application , such a filter will have a limited size , and the imitation of the whole diffracted field , and hence of dd , will fail . a more practical filtering dd method would be to wrap a rigid curved holographic film to roughly encircle an aperture , and illuminate both its @xmath25 sides , in the presence of the aperture , with coherent plane waves .",
    "the developed illuminated plate will then recreate the dd field when illuminated from the @xmath21 side .    in practice",
    "a dd field can be accomplished by any one of five general procedures : 1 )  an array of sources mimicking the local phase and amplitude values along an entire continuous random cross - section @xmath24 of the original field .",
    "2 )  by reflecting a diffracted field normally upon itself .",
    "3 )  the creation of the wavefronts @xmath42 by suitably focusing a plane or spherical wave .",
    "4 )  holographic methods or 5 )  a filter illuminated normally by a plane wave ( hence the phase is uniform on the filter ) having only amplitude changes .",
    "finally , it must be cautioned that when performing dd field calculations , using elementary wavelets , or the kirchhoff integral , these must be used in the correct orientation .",
    "the wavelets always point from the geometrical rays 5,6,7 of fig .  5 to the circular diffracted patterns .",
    "an integration of bow wavelets on @xmath22 will give @xmath42 , but integrating wavelets on @xmath42 will not give the field on @xmath22 or the dd field in @xmath19 , since on @xmath42 the field is _ already _ diffracted . a rule of thumb",
    "is that the kirchhoff integral should not be used to evaluate the field of wavefronts such as @xmath42 , whose normals * s * rotate rapidly through @xmath16 at the aperture edge .",
    "simple experiments to prove the dd methods outlined in this paper were performed as follows , but a more sophisticated experimental verification of dd using electromagnetic radiation is still needed .    ultrasound wave field measured after reflection from ( a )  dd plane reflector , and ( b )  from a plane reflector of the same size.,width=325 ]    dd of ultrasound waves : the field of a 40 khz ultrasound source as reflected from a plane antenna and one with curved edges",

    "the model was lifted a distance @xmath64 representing the initial potential of the wave and the sheet stretched over the model as in fig .",
    "the gravity - wave - potential equivalence mentioned above ( and which might not be coincidental , as discussed below ) allows a study of the streamlines @xmath4 of the field since they will be the path taken by a marble rolling down the sheet s surface .",

    "dd methods  @xcite , applied through refocusing the field by reshaping the antenna by curving its rim , will allow fine resolution even with a large wavelength and a small antenna , since a truncated geometrical field can be focused to a point regardless of the field s wavelength or the aperture size .",
