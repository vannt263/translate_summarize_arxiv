    "short period binary stars interact early in their stellar evolution , experience enhanced mass - loss during one or two common - envelope phases @xcite , and end up as lower mass wds . thus the most compact binary systems are expected to form elm wds , and a survey targeting elm wds should discover merging systems .",

    "0106 was originally classified as a subdwarf star in the sdss dr4 wd catalog of @xcite .",
    "@xcite re - classified it as an elm wd based on a reanalysis of the sdss spectroscopy .",
    "our follow - up radial velocity and high speed photometric observations demonstrate that 0106 contains a pair of wds with an orbital period of only 39.1 minutes .",
    "this system , the shortest period detached binary wd system known , presents the first detection of a tidally distorted wd .    in section 2",

    "the relatively long exposure times ( 8 min ) compared to the orbital period ( 39.1 min ) results in an underestimated velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath16 .",

    "we randomly permute the light curve points in time and create @xmath38 simulated light curves .",
    "this analysis shows that the probability of the measured ellipsoidal variation signal being a random one is smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "we also checked for variations in the brightest reference star by folding its light curve for the 39.1 min period of 0106 .",
    "this analysis did not reveal any periodic variations in the reference star .",
    "these tests show that the detected variability is highly significant .    to model the ellipsoidal variations and the reflection effect , we follow @xcite . in their formalism , the amplitude of the ellipsoidal effect is roughly @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the orbital semi - major axis and @xmath42 is the radius of the primary @xcite .",

    "the results change only slightly for different limb - darkening and gravity - darkening coefficients .",
    "the ellipsoidal variations are dominated by the cos 2@xmath45 term , which has an amplitude of 1.8% for the 0106 system at 90@xmath50 inclination .",
    "we estimate the contribution from the reflection effect to be @xmath510.1% and therefore neglect it . on the other hand ,",
    "the relativistic beaming effect is expected to be about 0.3% @xcite .",
    "we include the beaming effect , but not the eclipses in our calculations .",
    "the amplitudes of the ellipsoidal variations and the relativistic beaming effect depend on the companion mass and orbital separation , which depend on the inclination of the system .",
    "hence , the predicted amplitudes can be represented by a single parameter , the inclination angle .",
    "we create model light curves for each inclination angle and chose the model with the least @xmath11 as the best - fit model ( shown as a solid line in figure 3 ) .",
    "this model has an inclination angle of @xmath52 and it matches the phase and amplitude of the variations relatively well .",
    "the absence of eclipses in the photometry is also consistent with this inclination angle .",
    "the dotted line shows a comparable model with an inclination angle of @xmath37 .",
    "the similarities between the two models and the relatively large scatter in our photometry indicate that the error in inclination is relatively large .",
    "to constrain the inclination angle of the system more accurately , we perform a monte carlo analysis where we replace the measured flux @xmath53 with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the error in flux and @xmath56 is a gaussian deviate with zero mean and unit variance . for each of the @xmath38 sets of simulated light curves , we repeat our analysis and find the best - fitting model ( and the inclination angle ) . we adopt the interquartile range as the uncertainty .",
    "the monte carlo analysis shows that the 0106 light curve is best explained by a model with @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the companion is most likely a 0.43  object at an orbital separation of 0.32 .",
    "the mass ratio of the binary is @xmath58 and the merger time due to gravitational wave radiation is 37 myr .",
    "0106 is the shortest period detached binary wd system currently known . even though its orbital period is comparable to the am cvn systems , its spectrum shows only hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "there is no evidence of interaction or mass accretion between the two components other than the slight distortion of the elm wd due to mutual gravitation .",
    "the observed ellipsoidal variations are extremely useful for constraining the inclination angle and the masses of both components of the system .",
    "the optical spectroscopy and photometry of this system is best explained by a binary system containing two he - core wds with @xmath59 0.17  and @xmath60 0.43  at a separation of 0.32 .",
    "the future evolution of the system depends on the mass ratio of the two components . for a mass ratio of @xmath58",
    ", 0106 will likely have unstable mass transfer and merge .",
    "@xcite simulate the mergers of double degenerate systems including 0.2  elm wds with 0.3 - 0.8  wd companions .",
    "their smoothed - particle hydrodynamic models indicate that systems with @xmath61 have unstable mass transfer and merge after 20 - 80 orbits ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the possibility of stable mass transfer ) .",
    "unstable mass transfer may also lead to the detonation of the surface helium layer on a c / o wd via kelvin - helmholtz instabilities .",
    "@xcite find that the required conditions for triggering a surface explosion are only achieved in @xmath36  wd accretors with @xmath620.2  companions .",
    "hence , no efficient carbon burning is expected in binary wd systems containing 0.45 - 0.8  c / o wd accretors and elm wd donors . based on these results , 0106 will likely merge and create a 0.6  core - he burning subdwarf in 37 myr .",
    "this mass is close to the canonical mass of 0.5  for subdwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the merger rate of elm wds from a complete , color - selected sample of elm wds found in the hypervelocity star survey @xcite . roughly 5 @xmath63 ( with a factor of few uncertainty ) elm wds formed in the galactic disk in the last gyr .",
    "about 70% of these systems merge in less than a gyr , and 66% of these systems have mass ratios @xmath640.25 . from these estimates , roughly 2.3 @xmath63 elm wds merged in the past gyr .",
    "there are three stars with @xmath640.25 and merger times shorter than a hubble time in their sample .",
    "these three stars , j0818 + 3536 , j0923 + 3028 , and j1053 + 5200 , contain 0.17 - 0.23  + 0.33 - 0.44  wds ( assuming an average inclination angle of 60@xmath50 ) .",
    "based on the evolutionary calculations by @xcite , they are likely to form 0.5 - 0.67  single subdwarfs . hence , the formation rate of single subdwarfs through mergers of elm wds is roughly 2.3 @xmath63 in the last gyr . adding 0106 to this sample",
    "would increase this rate by about 50% due to its relatively short merger time .",
    "@xcite presents population synthesis models for the galactic population of subdwarf b stars .",
    "he predicts a total number of 5.6 @xmath65 single subdwarfs to form as a result of he wd mergers .",
    "the resulting mass distribution is centered around 0.5  with a tail toward higher masses , similar to the mass distribution of the merger systems discussed above .",
    "hence , the elm wd merger systems contribute significantly to the population of single subdwarfs in the galaxy .",
    "short period binary wds are important gravitational wave sources . @xcite and @xcite argue that about half a dozen am cvn binaries should be detected by lisa . with an orbital period similar to the known",
    "am cvn systems , 0106 may be a promising candidate for detection . the orbital period , inclination , and model - dependent distance estimate for 0106 yield the gravitational wave strain at earth , @xmath66 at a frequency @xmath67 ( hz ) = @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this is at the s / n = 1 detection limit of lisa after 1 year of observations .",
    "confusion with galactic noise sources decreases with accurately known orbital periods .",
    "our ephemeris and orbital period measurements may enable lisa to detect 0106 above the galactic background noise after a few years of observations .",
    "we discovered the shortest period detached binary wd system currently known .",
    "this system also presents the first detection of a tidally distorted wd .",
    "we constrain the inclination angle of the system using high - speed photometric observations .",
    "0106 contains a pair of low - mass wds at an inclination angle of @xmath2 .",
    "follow - up high - speed photometric observations at a larger telescope will be useful to better constrain the inclination ( and therefore the companion mass ) and to search for grazing eclipses .",
