    "the nilpotency ( [ eq : nilp ] ) is trivially satisfied due to the property of the fermionic coordinates ( [ eq : ferpro ] ) .",

    "we showed that when a quasi - solvability condition is satisfied an  model can be constructed .",
    "in ref.@xcite we used this method of construction for the type a subclass of , which is defined by the following form of the supercharges @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "we choose the functional subspace where solvable energy eigenstates belong as the space @xmath24 spanned by the bases @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a solution of a differential equation @xmath27 ( prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath9 ) and @xmath28_{\\,.}\\ ] ] we showed that the hamiltonian @xmath29 of type a   is always written as ; @xmath30{c } \\displaystyle\\sum_{i , j=+,0,-}\\\\[-3pt ] \\scriptstyle j\\ge i \\end{array }   a_{ij}j^ij^j + \\sum_{i=+,0,-}b_ij^i + c \\ , \\biggr]\\,u , \\label{eq : sl2desu}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are  generators on @xmath32 ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants .",
    "these generators satisfy the algebra , @xmath36=-2j^0 , \\quad [ j^\\pm , j^0\\,]=\\mp j^\\pm,\\ ] ] and form the following casimir operator : @xmath37 by using this identity , we choose @xmath38 in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : sl2desu ] ) without loosing generality . as a result , there are eight independent real parameters @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 in the hamiltonian .    given the above form of the hamiltonian , the energy eigenstates are obtained in a trivial manner : one can use @xmath42 matrix representations of the generators @xmath31 and write @xmath43 as an @xmath42 matrix and simply diagonalize it .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we derived the following conditions by requiring that the hamiltonian @xmath29 reduce to the canonical form ( [ eq : hfutu ] ) ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 have to be satisfied . from the fact that @xmath46 is ( at most ) a fourth order polynomial of @xmath2 and by the use of the relation ( [ eq : ehrel ] ) , we found the following condition on @xmath47 : @xmath48 for @xmath49 . also , by comparing the coefficients of the highest order terms of @xmath46 and @xmath50 , we found @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "when these conditions are met , the potentials @xmath53 are given by the following : @xmath54 it is also possible to derive the conditions ( [ eq : t1])([eq : t3 ] ) by a direct calculation of the  algebra ( [ eq : nfsusyalgebra ] ) @xcite .",
    "from the results reviewed in the previous section , we see that one method of constructing a type a  model is to find a solution @xmath47 of the differential equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) , solve eq.([eq : t2 ] ) to find a solution @xmath55 , and then obtain the potentials @xmath53 according to the relation ( [ eq : t3 ] ) .",
    "we analyzed several models in this manner in ref.@xcite .",
    "this method , however , is difficult to carry out , or at least cumbersome .",
    "the  construction reviewed above provides a rather simple and compact alternative to the above program : instead of solving the nonlinear differential equation ( [ eq : t1 ] ) , we can use its origin , eq.([eq : p4aaaa ] ) , which can be solved as , @xmath56 once @xmath26 is obtained by inverting eq.([eq : qhin ] ) , we can obtain @xmath47 according to eq.([eq : ehrel ] ) and @xmath55 according to the relation ( [ eq : p3aaaa ] ) , or @xmath57 where we have used a relation @xmath58 and absorbed some of the @xmath59-coefficients in the redefinition of @xmath60-coefficients : @xmath61 once this is done , the potentials are simply given by the expression ( [ eq : t3 ] ) from @xmath47 and @xmath55 .",
    "they are given as the following functions of @xmath2 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "unfortunately , for the most general fourth order polynomial @xmath46 , the integral in eq.([eq : qhin ] ) involves elliptic integrals , and therefore the function @xmath26 can not be written down explicitly .",
    "for this reason , we will start with the most simple @xmath46 and proceed to more complex ones . in doing so",
    ", it is important to classify resulting models , as many of them are equivalent to each other .",
    "this is because of the following : let us define a new function @xmath64 by the following ; @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath9-independent constants .",
    "using @xmath64 in place of @xmath2 does not affect the physical content of the model , because @xmath2 is introduced to form the basis @xmath32 that defines the space @xmath24 and the new base @xmath68 defines the same space of @xmath24 .",
    "this invariance under the linear transformation ( [ eq : lintra ] ) is also evident in the expression @xmath47 in eq.([eq : ehrel ] ) . a caution , however , is needed for @xmath46 . in order for eq.([eq : p4aaaa ] ) to be satisfied with @xmath64 , or equivalently , for @xmath9 to be invariant ( up to the trivial integration constant ) in eq.([eq : qhin ] ) , we need to replace as @xmath46 as follows : @xmath69 as for @xmath55 , in doing the replacement ( [ eq : lintra ] ) we can transform the coefficients so that @xmath55 remains invariant .",
    "this way , the potentials remain invariant under the transformation ( [ eq : lintra ] ) and ( [ eq : p4tra ] ) .",
    "it is also important to note that on the right hand side of eq.([eq : qhin ] ) , even a complex integration constant is allowed , since it still is the solution of eq.([eq : p4aaaa ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can freely perform the following complex translation of @xmath9 in @xmath26 , @xmath47 , @xmath55 and @xmath70 ; @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an arbitrary complex constant . we will also use this when necessary .    in the following construction of model",
    ", we will classify the resulting models according to the distribution of zero points ( and their orders ) of @xmath46 .",
    "and then we will use the transformation ( [ eq : lintra ] ) and ( [ eq : p4tra ] ) to choose representatives of each class by moving the zero points of @xmath46 to convenient locations ; typically @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the zero point @xmath73 having the highest order , as much as we can .",
    "( in doing so , we will avoid distinguishing @xmath64 from @xmath2 and @xmath75 from @xmath76 unless it is necessary . )",
    "we will denote the resulting models by the set of the zero points of @xmath46 with the order of each zero point as a superindex ( if more that one ) ; for example @xmath77 denotes a model who has a zero point of order 2 at @xmath73 and a zero point of order 1 at @xmath78 .",
    "also , in the following we will choose the sign on the right hand side of eq.([eq : qhin ] ) , by using reflection of @xmath9 , so that the resulting expression is free from extra minus signs .",
    "the most simple model is given by a constant @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath80 , we obtain the following : @xmath81 which induces , @xmath82    applying the transformation ( [ eq : p4tra ] ) , we can get rid of the parameter @xmath83 ( and still not loose the generality ) . we choose to do so with @xmath84 , so that we have @xmath85 , which is equivalent to setting @xmath86 to start with . this way , we obtain the following : @xmath87 with suitable definition of parameters , the above potentials become asymmetric double - well potentials , whose  is spontaneously broken by nonperturbative effects .",
    "the solvable energy eigenvalues represent only the perturbative parts ( by suitable definition of the coupling constant ) .",
    "its nonperturbative aspects and the asymptotic behaviors of the perturbation series were studied in refs.@xcite and resulted in the discovery of  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath89 leads to the following when the integration constant is appropriately chosen : @xmath90 which results in ; @xmath91_{\\,.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we set @xmath92 , we reproduce case ( 0 ) studied above .",
    "for @xmath93 , the above lead to potentials that are rational polynomials of @xmath9 . in order to obtain a simple representative model , we apply the translation ( @xmath67 ) to move the zero point of @xmath46 to @xmath73 and use the scaling ( @xmath66 ) to set @xmath94 .",
    "this leads to the following : @xmath95.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the potentials are given by the following ; @xmath96 this model contains the sextic potentials studied in refs.@xcite as special cases .",
    "the general quadratic function @xmath98 leads to the following ; @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "reproduction to case ( 1 ) for @xmath101 is evident in these expressions .",
    "models in this category are classified to two cases ; ( 2a ) one zero point of order 2 , and ( 2b ) two different zero points .",
    "we will choose the zero points for each cases as ; ( 2a ) @xmath102 and ( 2b ) @xmath103 .",
