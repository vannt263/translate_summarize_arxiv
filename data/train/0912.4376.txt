    "such fitting to gaussian lines was only possible for temperatures @xmath76  k , because the spectral shape for @xmath77  k changes to a broad plateau  like pattern .",
    "it is important to note that there is an abrupt 10 % step  like decrease of the @xmath4li line width @xmath78 at around 2  k for the field orientation @xmath79 .",

    "the 3d long  range magnetic order is taken into account by a constant phase @xmath90 in eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] , whereas in case of the 2d long  range magnetic order the phase @xmath29 is only constant with respect to @xmath17 but arbitrary with respect to the @xmath19coordinate [ @xmath91 .",
    "the best agreement between experiment and simulations is obtained for the spin  modulated 2d magnetic structure , i.e. with a random phase relation between spins along the @xmath92axis ( cf .",

    "thus , at low temperatures and high magnetic fields @xmath47 long  range magnetic order in the * ab*plane without inter  plane coupling along the @xmath92direction is realized in licuvo@xmath1 .",
    "this proposed magnetic structure is consistent with the @xmath5v nmr spectra : the effective magnetic fields on these nuclei are dominated by contact fields of the four neighboring cu ions of the nearest * ab*plane ( see fig . [ fig_1 ] )",
    ". therefore , these spectra are not sensitive to magnetic disorder in @xmath92direction .",
    "this explains the double  horn shape of the @xmath5v nmr spectra for @xmath47 at very low temperatures @xmath34  k. in addition , the lack of a spiral spin structure proposed for @xmath47 accounts for the paraelectric behavior according to reference .    at elevated temperatures @xmath95",

    "it is important to note that broad gaussian lines can be observed up to approximately 15  k indicating short  range magnetic ordering at the time scale of the nmr experiment , far above the ordering temperature @xmath96  k. a lower bound of the time scale is given by the time for spin  echo formation which was achieved in our experiments with pulse separation times @xmath97 . from the spin ",
    "lattice relaxation time @xmath98 of our measurements we estimate an extension of the time scale even to milliseconds",
    ".    most probably this transformation of the @xmath5v nmr spectral shape ( see right column in fig . [ fig_3 ] ) indicates the loss of ferromagnetic interactions along the @xmath20direction towards higher temperatures . in order to corroborate this assumption we simulated the @xmath5v nmr spectra at 1.3 and 3  k for this scenario .",

    "for the simulation at 3  k , the release of ferromagnetic interactions between neighboring chains in the @xmath20direction towards higher temperatures is taken into account by randomizing the phase relation @xmath29 along the * a*direction as well [ @xmath100 in eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] ] .    in conclusion , the magnetic structure of the high  field magnetic phase of the quasi1d antiferromagnet licuvo@xmath1 was studied by nmr experiments .",
