    "two leading scenarios to explain the origin of gamma - ray bursts are the collapsar and supranova ( sa ) models ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the collapsar model @xcite assumes that grbs originate from the collapse of a massive star to a black hole . during the collapse process , a nuclear - density , several solar - mass accretion disk forms and accretes at the rate of @xmath0-@xmath1 s@xmath2 to drive a baryon - dilute , relativistic outflow through the surrounding stellar envelope .",
    "the duration of the accretion episode corresponds to the prompt gamma - ray luminous phase , which is commonly thought to involve internal shocks .",
    "a wide variety of collapsar models can be envisaged @xcite , but their central feature is the one - step collapse of the core of a massive star to a black hole .",
    "optical observations of grb afterglows reveal significant evidence for enhanced emission in excess of an extrapolation of the optical power - law decay spectra in a few cases , namely grb 980326 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) , grb 970228 ( reichart 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "2000 ) , and grb 011121 ( bloom et al . 2002 ; price et al .",
    "the spectrum of the excess is reddened at frequencies above the spectral peak , as might be expected for a thermal emitter .",
    "the peak of the excess emission occurs tens of days after the grb event ( in the local frame ) , and the sn event precedes grb 011121 by @xmath3 - 5 ( @xmath4 ) days @xcite , consistent with a one - step collapsar model .",
    "the supranova model @xcite of grbs involves a two - step collapse process of an evolved massive star to a black hole through the intermediate formation of a neutron star with mass exceeding several solar masses .",
    "the neutron star is initially stabilized against collapse by rotation , but the loss of angular momentum support through magnetic dipole and gravitational radiation leads to collapse of the neutron star to a black hole after some weeks to years .",
    "the accretion - induced collapse of a neutron star in a binary system could also form a grb @xcite .",
    "a two - step collapse process means that the neutron star is surrounded by a snr shell of enriched material at distances of @xmath5-@xmath6 cm from the central source .",
    "the earlier sn could yield @xmath0-@xmath7 of fe in the surrounding vicinity .",
    "the discovery of variable fe absorption during the prompt emission phase of grb 990705 @xcite and x - ray emission features in the afterglow spectra of grb 991216 @xcite has been interpreted in terms of the sa model @xcite .",
    "low significance x - ray absorption features observed in grb 970508 @xcite , grb 970828 @xcite , and grb 000214 @xcite can also be modeled within the sa scenario , preferably with photoionization reflection spectra @xcite .",
    "the multiple features detected in grb 011211 @xcite are also suggested to arise from an excited snr shell at @xmath5 cm from the central source .    a pw and pulsar wind bubble ( pwb ) consisting of a quasi - uniform , low density , highly magnetized pair - enriched medium within the snr shell is formed by a highly magnetized neutron star during the period of activity preceding its collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the pw with the shell material will fragment and accelerate the snr shell , and the pw emission will be a source of ambient radiation that can be comptonized to gamma - ray energies @xcite .    here",
    "we propose that the nonthermal leptonic pw radiation provides a source of hard ionizing radiation to heat and photoionize material in the snr shell , which is described in terms of a partial covering model as a result of the strong pw / snr interaction .",
    "this radiation heats the shell , and the escaping thermalized radiation is seen as the delayed reddened optical excesses in grb optical afterglow light curves .",
    "the source of ionizing nonthermal radiation , which is extinguished when the grb occurs , would provide a nonthermal precursor to a grb , though at low flux .",
    "various other features of this system are outlined .",
    "a very rapidly rotating , strongly magnetized neutron star is formed in the first step of the sa scenario . for a neutron star with surface polar field of @xmath8 g , a rotation rate of @xmath9 rad s@xmath2 , and a radius of 15@xmath10 km , the radiated power @xmath11 . the quantity",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 is the initial rotational energy of the neutron star , expressed in terms of the neutron - star mass @xmath14 and the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath15 , which remains roughly constant during collapse @xcite .",

    "s.    the torque equation , @xmath17 , where the braking index @xmath18 , can be solved to give @xmath19 , provided that @xmath20 remains constant @xcite .",
    "( for the crab , @xmath21 . )",
    "we assume that the spin - down power is radiated as a pw in the form of particle and poynting flux , so that the wind luminosity @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and we have divided the wind power into leptonic (  e \" ) , hadronic (  p \" ) , and electromagnetic (  b \" ) fractions @xmath24 @xmath25 .    in the sa model , rotational stability",
    "is lost due to spindown , and the neutron star collapses to a black hole to produce a grb at time @xmath26 . here",

    "the equation for the snr shell dynamics in a spherical approximation for the snr shell is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the snr shell mass , the wind pressure @xmath34 , the pwb volume @xmath35 , and the pwb radius @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this equation can be solved to give @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 @xmath40 ergs is the snr shell kinetic energy , and @xmath41 is the snr shell coasting speed . if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 for standard values , and shell acceleration must be considered .",
    "a highly porous shell has @xmath44 .",
    "this will occur for strong clumping of the ejecta , which takes place on the rayleigh - taylor timescale @xmath45 , where the characteristic clumping size scale is @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath47 in the regime @xmath48 .",
    "this shows that small - scale ( @xmath49 ) clumping will occur when @xmath50 .",
    "only a detailed hydrodynamic simulation can characterize the porosity of the shell due to effects of the pulsar wind , which @xmath31 parameterizes . here",
    "we assume , in contrast to the picture of @xcite , that a large fraction of the wind energy escapes the snr shell and @xmath51 , so that shell acceleration can be neglected .",
    "this effect also causes the shell to become effectively thomson thin much earlier than estimated on the basis of a uniform shell approximation , except for high density clouds with small covering factor .",
    "a general treatment is needed to treat shell dynamics , including travel - time delays of the pulsar wind and deceleration of the snr shell by the surrounding medium .",
    "when @xmath52 , as assumed here , @xmath53 .",
    "the strong pw provides a source of nonthermal leptons , hadrons , and electromagnetic field .",
    "dominant radiation components considered here are leptonic synchrotron and ssc radiation , and thermal emission from the inner surface of the snr shell which is heated by the nonthermal radiation .      the volume - averaged mean magnetic field @xmath54 in the snr cavity powered by the pw is obtained by relating the wind magnetic field energy density @xmath55 through the magnetic - field parameter @xmath56 , also assumed to be constant in time . thus @xmath57 let @xmath58 represent the typical lorentz factors of leptons in the wind zone of the pulsar .",
    "this value should remain roughly constant when @xmath30 .",
    "a quasi - monoenergetic proton / ion wind may also be formed , though we only consider leptonic processes here , and furthermore do not treat nonthermal particle acceleration at the pw / snr shell boundary shock .",

    "the energy gained by a photon upon being scattered by relativistic electrons @xcite , with scattering restricted to the thomson regime , the @xmath73 ssc spectrum from the cooling wind electrons is given by @xmath104|_{x_0}^{x_1 } , \\label{nulnussc}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , where we have used approximation ( [ nulnusynapprox ] ) for the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the snr shell is pictured as having been shredded by the pw and therefore highly porous , though permeated with small scale ( @xmath108-@xmath109 cm ) density irregularities consisting largely of metals @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath110 of @xmath111ni provides a radioactive decay power of @xmath112 ergs s@xmath2 before decaying on an @xmath113 day timescale .",
    "the partial covering factor @xmath114 corresponds to the covering fraction by optically - thick , dense shell inhomogeneities . recognizing the severe limitations in the following expression , we determine the effective temperature @xmath115 in the interior of the shell through the relation @xmath116 where @xmath117 is an absorption coefficient , dependent in general on the evolving radiation spectrum , though @xmath118 is here assumed constant .",
    "the wind heating is more important than heating from the decay of radioactive ni when @xmath119 @xmath120 . in this regime , @xmath121 letting @xmath122 because @xmath123 . for standard parameters ,",
    "the shell is heated to @xmath124 k temperatures when @xmath125 .",
    "when @xmath126 , this occurs at @xmath127 .",
    "the pw heat source is extinguished once the grb occurs , and the thermal emission from the snr shell will decay on the dynamical timescale @xmath128 d , noting that the cooling timescale of a hot shell is generally shorter than @xmath129 .",
    "fig .  1 shows the total @xmath73 flux composed of synchrotron , ssc , and thermal components , calculated according to the above simple analysis .",
    "standard parameters are @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",

    "this system is in accord with the standard sa model and might explain the delayed excess emission in grb 011121 , contrary to the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the set of three dotted curves employ standard parameters , except that @xmath139 , and @xmath140 and 0.01 as labeled ( @xmath141 d ) , with @xmath142 , and @xmath143 days ( @xmath144 ks ) , and @xmath145 and @xmath146 k , respectively .",
    "the intense pw x - ray synchrotron emission provides a source of ionizing photons throughout the snr shell that would decay on the timescale @xmath129 ( the line flux would decay on @xmath147 ) .",
    "the @xmath148 case might correspond to a grb 011211-type system .",
    "the pw radiation field provides an additional source of ionizing photons in the sa model not considered by , e.g. , @xcite , and would be energetically important for this case if @xmath149 . a varying ionization flux impinging on an expanding snr shell will produce a characteristic kinematic signature of shell illumination .",
    "our results differ from the conclusions of @xcite , because we assume that the snr shell highly porous , as in the scenario of @xcite .",
    "the thin solid curve is the result for standard parameters except that @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 d. for this case , @xmath153 d and @xmath154 k. it is apparent that a sizeable parameter regime could make quasi - thermal emission between @xmath155-@xmath156 hz at the level of @xmath157-@xmath158 ergs s@xmath2 some tens of days after the grb event .",
    "thus , even if the grb takes place months after the sn , a delayed reddened excess from the cooling shell may be seen , for plausible parameters , some tens of days after the grb .",
    "the pw heating is in addition to the the heating due to the ni@xmath159 co @xmath159 fe chain , and may relax the need to have @xmath160 , as required to explain the unusually bright light curve of sn 1998bw @xcite . the thermal emission from the snr shell heated by the pw is proposed to be the origin of the reddened optical excess emission detected in grbs 970228 , 980326 , and 011121 .",
    "this model predicts decaying nonthermal ionizing hard x - ray emission , which could be detected with integral or swift from nearby @xmath161 - 0.3 grbs when the pw synchrotron flux is at the level @xmath162 ergs s@xmath2 . a nonthermal optical emission signature would accompany the reddened excess , with a relative intensity that depends sensitively on @xmath163",
    "a hard x - ray sky survey instrument such as exist could monitor for the pw nonthermal emission preceding aligned and off - axis grbs .",
