    "exploring unconventional or exotic superconducting phase has been attached great interest and been one of the streams of the superconductivity research @xcite , since the cooper pair wave functions have internal degrees of freedom reflecting the additional symmetry breaking other than the gauge symmetry @xmath1(1 ) .",
    "it is important to identify the pairing state with an internal degree of freedom of cooper pairs in order to examine exotic phenomena in unconventional superconductors ( scs ) .",
    "furthermore , the identification gives the clue to the pairing mechanism and offers the future application of unconventional scs to new superconducting devices .",
    "recently , locally noncentrosymmetric ( lncs ) superconducting systems are regarded as a new family of exotic scs @xcite .",
    "these systems are found in various real crystalline materials , such as the heavy fermion superlattice cecoin@xmath2/ybcoin@xmath2 @xcite , the pnictide sc srptas @xcite , the layered transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite and so on . a staggered anti - symmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) due to the local noncentrosymmetricity appears in the lncs system with global inversion symmetry , as the uniform asoc appears in the ncs system without global inversion symmetry . in lncs systems",
    ", the sublattice structure plays an important role in the internal structure of the cooper pair @xcite . in multilayered system ,",
    "maruyama _ et al .",
    "_ showed that superconducting properties continuously change from the isolated ncs layers to the correlated lncs multilayer with increasing the interlayer coupling , in terms of the study of the spin susceptibility in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "exotic superconducting phases called the pair - density wave ( pdw ) phase @xcite and the complex - stripe phase @xcite were theoretically predicted to stabilize in multilayered systems in a high magnetic field , when the paramagnetic depairing effect is dominant .",
    "indeed , experimental results in epitaxial superlattices cecoin@xmath3/ybcoin@xmath4 suggested that some exotic superconducting states might be realized at high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a numerical calculation demonstrated that the pdw phase stabilizes at low temperatures and high magnetic fields perpendicular to the layers through the @xmath0-wave pairing interaction , layer - dependent rashba asoc and zeeman magnetic field @xcite . in the pdw state , the phase of the superconducting order parameter modulates layer by layer @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the simplest model for multilayered systems , namely bilayer systems , the order parameter @xmath5 changes its phase by @xmath6 between layers , @xmath7 .",
    "such unusual stacking of order parameter is in sharp contrast to the conventional bcs state , where the order parameter is uniform , @xmath8 . in real materials ,",
    "vortices appear in the high magnetic field , although the previous studies neglected them @xcite .",
    "when the vortex density is not large , the phase modulation around vortices does not seriously affect the phase modulation between the stacked layers .",
    "thus , the vortices induced by the orbital effect do not play a crucial role in the stability of the pdw phase @xcite .",
    "it is , however , important to investigate the vortex state since the excitations around vortex cores dominate transport and thermodynamic properties .",
    "moreover , the observation of quasiparticle states around a vortex core gives us a variety of information to identify the pairing state .",
    "the quasiparticle states can be experimentally studied through the local quasiparticle density of states ( ldos ) , which are obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) experiments with high spatial and energy resolutions .",

    "recently , the vortex bound states are experimentally explored also in ncs bipd by stm / sts @xcite .",
    "a theoretically predicted spectroscopic feature of the parity - mixed superconducting state due to the lack of an inversion center is a two - gap structure of quasiparticle spectra in the bulk @xcite , but any distinct spectroscopic evidence was not observed in these experiments . in recent years , however , vortex core states in materials with strong soc are measured by stm / sts in the context of topological superconductivity @xcite .",

    ", the pair potential amplitude gets larger monotonically with increasing the soc strength @xmath106 .",
    "this is because the pdw state can be mapped onto the two - dimensional rashba sc with use of the mirror symmetry as discussed later , and then the rashba type soc locks the spin quantization axis within the @xmath107 plane to suppress the paramagnetic depairing effect .",
    "in contrast , in the bcs state , the pair potential amplitude shows an unusual non - monotonic behavior with increasing the soc strength .",
    "an intriguing feature is seen in the vortex core radius . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the core radius in the pdw state is smaller than that in the bcs state in accordance with fig .",

    "p85mmp85 mm +    we here discuss the energy and spatial dependence of the ldos around a vortex in the bcs and pdw states and clarify the change of the electronic structure at the bcs - pdw transition .",
    "we fix the zeeman magnetic field and the soc strength to @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "the self - consistent solutions for the gap equation displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are used to calculate the ldos . in the bcs states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the zero energy vortex bound states split into the four peaks due to the interlayer hopping and the zeeman field . on the other hand , in the pdw state , a large quasiparticle dos appears at the zero energy [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "this is quite contrasting with the ldos structure in the bcs state .",
    "when we consider the pdw state in the absence of the soc ( the pdw state is indeed unstable in the absence of the soc ) , the four ldos peaks appear as in the bcs state due to the interlayer hopping and the zeeman field .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the ldos is also similar to that in the bcs state .",
    "thus , the contrasting behaviors between the pdw and bcs states in fig .  [ fig3 ] results from the soc .",
    "one might speculate that the two peaks in the ldos at @xmath110 get combined with increasing the soc strength .",
    "however , we should notice another origin of the appearance of the zero energy vortex bound states in the pdw state , which is described in the remaining part of this section .",

    "the quasiparticle structure around the vortex core is similar between the pdw and bcs states . on the other hand , in the presence of the soc ,",
    "the internal structure of cooper pairs manifests itself in the quasiparticle structure @xcite .",
    "indeed , the zero energy quasiparticle state appears around a vortex core in the pdw state as a result of the sign change of order parameter between layers [ fig .",

    "[ fig4](a ) , andreev bound states have a finite energy almost independent of the soc strength .",
    "the peaks in the low energy region shift a little to lower energy with increasing the soc strength , whereas those in the high energy region move to higher energy .    on the other hand , in the pdw state",
    ", the zep in ldos gradually develops with increasing the soc strength [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] . at @xmath98 ,",
    "the ldos at the vortex center clearly shows the zep , which has already been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "thus , the soc plays a crucial role in the contrasting quasiparticle structure around a vortex core between the bcs and pdw states .",
    "the soc is much larger than the superconducting gap in most ncs and lncs , and thus , the condition , @xmath112 , is satisfied .",
    "therefore , the zero energy bound states will appear around the vortex core when the pdw state is stabilized in the magnetic field .",
    "although the vortex core states in the bcs state show zeeman splitting , the zep in the pdw state is robust against the zeeman field . this result can be viewed as a result of the suppression of the paramagnetic depairing effect in the pdw state .",
    "an indication for the suppression of the paramagnetic depairing effect is obtained by calculating the @xmath113-axis spin susceptibility in the superconducting state .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin susceptibility is not decreased by the pdw order ( see figs . 2 and 11 in ref .",
    "this indicates that the zeeman field does not suppress the superconducting state and does not split the zep .",
    "another consequence of the suppression of the paramagnetic depairing effect is the particle - hole symmetry in the mirror subsector in the pdw state @xcite .",
    "this aspect is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] .    in the next section ,",
    "we show the energy spectra in the bulk to clarify the effect of the soc on the energy dispersion .",
    "we also discuss the relation between the vortex bound states and the bulk energy spectra .",
    "in this section , we investigate effects of the soc on the energy spectra in the bulk and discuss the relation between the bulk superconducting gap and the vortex bound states .",
    "we diagonalize the following @xmath114 bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian to obtain the energy spectra : @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",

    "although we leave the evaluation of the free energy in the vortex lattice state for a future work , the pdw state is stable in the vortex lattice state in a situation discussed below .    since the spatial modulation of the order parameter due to vortices occurs within @xmath157-@xmath158 plane , this modulation does not affect seriously the phase modulation along the @xmath70-axis specifying the pdw state , if the density of vortices is not large . in heavy fermion compounds ,",
    "a large effective electron mass gives rise to a short coherence length and a large orbital limit of upper critical field @xmath159 .",
    "we consider the high magnetic field region where @xmath160 satisfies the condition @xmath161 at low temperature , with the conventional pauli - limiting field @xmath162 and the electronic @xmath163-factor @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the density of vortices is not large and each vortex is sufficiently separated from other vortices . in this situation , we may consider that the pdw state is stabilized also in the vortex lattice state . indeed , focusing on a single vortex , which is far separated from the other vortices , we have already showed that a self - consistent solution of the order parameter exists only in the pdw state in high magnetic fields @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "in such a high magnetic field , the vortex solution of the order parameter in the bcs state does not exist , since the bcs state is completely suppressed by the paramagnetic depairing effect @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the result in the paramagnetic limit @xcite . in a short coherence length situation discussed above",
    ", the dominant paramagnetic depairing effect stabilizes the pdw state in the vortex state .",
    "hence , we assume scs with a large maki parameter @xmath165 @xcite . this situation is often realized in heavy fermion compounds .",
    "one of the promising candidate compounds in which the paramagnetic depairing effect plays a dominant role in the cooper pair destruction mechanism is a representative heavy fermion sc cecoin@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is plausible that the epitaxial heavy fermion superlattice cecoin@xmath2/ybcoin@xmath2 is a candidate compound of the pdw state . indeed",
    ", it shows a large value of @xmath166 @xcite ( @xmath167 large @xmath168 ) as in the bulk cecoin@xmath2 .",
    "the suppression of the paramagnetic depairing effect in the pdw state is related to particle - hole symmetry in the mirror subsector .",
    "a subsector hamiltonian in the bilayer pdw state is equivalent to the hamiltonian of two dimensional rashba scs @xcite , in which the particle - hole symmetry is preserved . in two dimensional rashba scs , the paramagnetic depairing is suppressed in a zeeman field parallel to @xmath70-axis when the soc is sufficiently large .",
    "this is an intuitive understanding of the paramagnetic deparing suppressed in the pdw state .    on the other hand , the bcs state is affected by the paramagnetic depairing effect .",
    "the mirror subsector in the bcs state lacks particle - hole symmetry due to the existence of an interlayer coupling and a zeeman field .",
    "thus a subsector hamiltonian is no longer the hamiltonian of scs .",
    "then , the bcs state is affected by the paramagnetic depairing effect , and the zep splits off .",
    "the order parameter in a layer in both bcs and pdw states can be viewed as a uniform isotropic @xmath0-wave pairing without center of mass momentum of cooper pairs .",
    "thus , one can just seek the conventional vortex solution without the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) modulation within the layer by self - consistent calculations .",
    "the fflo vortex core does not necessarily possess the zero energy states unlike the pdw vortex core .",
    "as shown in refs . @xcite and @xcite , the zero energy ldos at the vortex core split into two peaks at finite energies due to the zeeman field , and each peak corresponds to a spin component .",
    "it is possible to distinguish the pdw vortex core from the fflo one by investigating the presence or absence of zero - energy quasiparticle bound states at a vortex center .",
    "we again stress that unusual spectral features in the pdw state comes from the soc and particle - hole symmetry of the mirror subsector .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , a large bulk spectral gap @xmath169 opens at @xmath121 in the pdw state , while there appears a small energy gap in the bcs state [ fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) ] ( note that fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] depicts the energy spectra for only one subsector hamiltonian ) .",
    "this results from the particle - hole symmetry ( asymmetry ) in the mirror subsector in the pdw ( bcs ) state .",
    "the vortex core radius is characterized by the coherence length , which is inversely proportional to the magnitude of @xmath169 . in the bcs state ,",
    "the small @xmath169 gives rise to the large vortex core size . on the other hand ,",
    "the large @xmath169 appears due to the change of the internal structure of the cooper pair by increasing the magnetic field through the bcs - pdw transition , leading to a sudden vortex core shrinkage .",
    "a possible manifestation of the bcs - pdw phase transition may be observed in an entropy jump , giving rise to the increase of superlattice temperature as the latent heat through the bcs - pdw first order transition @xcite with increasing a magnetic field . in general , it is difficult to observe bulk quantities in thin films .",
    "however , the site - selective nmr experiment has succeeded in epitaxial superlattices cecoin@xmath2/ybcoin@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the vicinity of the bcs - pdw transition field , the zero energy dos obtained from the nmr spectra might depend on a magnetic field sublinearly , reflecting the decrease of low - energy excitations due to the vortex core shrinkage .",
    "this change in the low - energy excitations may occur not only in the isotropic @xmath0-wave state studied in this paper but also in the @xmath170-wave pairing state expected in the superlattices cecoin@xmath2/ybcoin@xmath2 .",
    "direct observation of the vortex core shrinkage by stm / sts is also promising way to detect the bcs - pdw transition .",
    "we have numerically investigated the electronic structure of a vortex core in bilayer rashba scs by means of the self - consistent quasiclassical calculation .",
    "we found that the ldos structure in the pdw state is quite different from that in the bcs state .",
    "the zero energy vortex bound state exists in the pdw state , whereas it is absent in the bcs state due to the zeeman effect .",
    "this prominent difference stems from ( i ) the presence or absence of particle - hole symmetry in the mirror subsector of the block - diagonalized bdg hamiltonian and ( ii ) the internal structure of the cooper pair influenced by the soc .",
    "another intriguing feature of the pdw state is the small vortex core size compared with the bcs state , leading to a sudden shrinkage of vortex cores through the bcs - pdw phase transition . the characteristic vortex core structure in the pdw state",
    "may be observed by stm / sts and/or nmr measurements at low temperatures .",
    "the exotic superconducting phase under a magnetic field may be identified by investigating these features .",
