    "there are strong indications- the latest of which came from the superkamiokande collaboration @xcite- that neutrinos do have a mass , albeit a very tiny one , and , as a result , `` oscillate '' .",
    "the exact nature of the masses as well as the oscillation angles is an important subject which is under intense investigation @xcite .",
    "consequently , there exists many interesting models which , in one way or another , try to accomodate most of the known data .",
    "it is perhaps prudent to think that the subject of neutrino masses and oscillation is still a very open one .",
    "it is fair to say that the extreme smallness of neutrino masses suggests something very peculiar about these particles .",
    "this peculiarity could come from the way the neutrinos obtain their masses and/or from the very special nature of the neutrinos themselves which distinguish them from all other particles .",
    "for example , do right - handed neutrinos ( present in most models of neutrino masses ) carry quantum numbers which are absent in some or all other ( left- or right - handed ) fermions ?",
    "after all , right - handed neutrinos , if present , would be singlets under @xmath1 anyway .",
    "most efforts on the problem of neutrino masses , at least on the model - building front , are concentrated on the construction of lepton mass matrices based on various ansatzes .",
    "there is one common assumption present in many of such models , which is one in which light neutrino masses arise from a see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses would come from an expression that goes like @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a dirac mass , and @xmath4 is a majorana mass which typically is very much larger than @xmath3 . in these models ,",
    "the scale of new physics @xmath4 , as suggested by the lightness of neutrino masses , would be some kind of grand unified scale or even the breaking scale of left - right symmetry models @xcite .",
    "( lepton number is not a conserved quantity in this class of models . )",
    "the see - saw mechanism is a very elegant approach which is widely embraced .",
    "however , one could not help but wonder if there might be some other mechanism for obtaining tiny neutrino masses , and if so , how it would fare compared with the see - saw mechanism .",
    "would this new mechanism shed light on other important issues ?",
    "what would be its scale of new physics ?",
    "can one find an experimental distinction between the two mechanisms ?",
    "this was the topic discussed in @xcite .",
    "at the present time , it is not clear that , if neutrinos do have a mass , it would be of the majorana or dirac type . as we have mentioned above , with majorana neutrinos and the see - saw mechanism , one could `` easily '' obtain small neutrino masses .",
    "now if the mass were to be of the dirac type , one can straightforwardly write down a gauge - invariant yukawa coupling in the sm itself ( endowed with right - handed neutrinos , of course ) .",
    "but to obtain a small neutrino mass , one has to put in _ by hand _ a yukawa coupling which is incredibly small , of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "such a fine tuning is highly unnatural and that might be the reason why little attention is given to the construction of models based on dirac neutrino masses .",
    "did we leave something out by ignoring it ?",
    "what if the mass is truly of the dirac type ? until this question is settled , it is worthwhile to investigate possible alternatives to the see - saw mechanism .",
    "this paper and a previous one @xcite propose one of such alternatives by constructing a model of _ dirac _ neutrino masses where the smallness of their values arises dynamically .",
    "one of the criteria used in building such a model is the wish to go beyond the mere presentation of a neutrino mass matrix . in particular",
    ", we would like to see if there might be other _ phenomenological consequences _ which could be testable : new particles , new physics signals , etc .. this is the aim we set about in building our model .",
    "the construction of the model presented in @xcite was based on the following questions : if neutrino masses were so small compared to all other known masses , would there be an appearance of a special symmetry when one lets the mass go to zero ?",
    "could this special symmetry , if it exists , be a peculiar feature of the right - handed neutral leptons alone ?",
    "could there be additional purposes for its existence other than providing a small mass for the neutrinos ?",
    "in other words , can one learn something more from it ?",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that there is indeed an interesting symmetry which acts only on the right - handed neutrinos and which , in addition to providing a reason for the smallness of the neutrino masses , also constrains the nature ( even or odd ) of the number of generations .",
    "furthermore , the way in which neutrino masses are constructed can be used to build a model for charged lepton and quark masses .",
    "in addition , this particular way of constructing masses might even have some bearing on the strong cp problem .",
    "last but not least : are there additional tests of various neutrino models other than neutrino oscillations ? for the see - saw mechanism with majorana neutrinos ,",
    "one already sees that one of such additional signals is , for example , the phenomenon of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "as it will be presented below , the addtional signals of the model presented here will involve a number of very concrete predictions : the absence of neutrinoless double beta decay , the possible presence of `` low mass '' ( a couple of hundreds of gev e.g. ) vector - like fermions , among other things .",
    "in particular , the detection of these vector - like fermions do not in any way involve neutrinos .",
    "one particularly important feature of our model is the following predictions for neutrino oscillations , assuming only the validity of the atmostpheric and solar neutrino data : 1 ) the three light neutrinos are nearly degenerate ; 2 ) if the light neutrinos have a mass large enough to form a component of the hot dark matter ( hdm ) @xcite then _ only _ the msw solution to the solar neutrino oscillation is favored ; 3 ) if the vacuum solution to the solar neutrino problem turns out to be the correct one , our model will only be able to accomodate tiny neutrino masses , around @xmath6 or less , ruling out near - degenerate neutrinos as components of hdm . as a result , in our model",
    ", one can not have both vacuum solution and hdm .",
    "we will show below the correlation between the masses and the differences of mass squared , @xmath7 , which enter the neutrino oscillation phenomena .    assuming the existence of the aforementioned symmetry , how can one construct dirac neutrino masses to be dynamically small ? by `` dynamically '' , it is meant that the mass is zero at tree level and that any non - zero value would have to arise at the one - loop ( or more ) level .",
    "now , the peculiar ( and toughest ) thing about neutrinos is the fact that their mass is so small- at least eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale . in constructing our model for dirac neutrino masses ,",
    "it is then reasonable to ask under what conditions would the dynamical dirac mass of the neutrinos obtained at the one loop level be `` naturally '' small , i.e. devoid of excessive fine tuning . in this paper , we present the following interesting results : in the four - generation model , it is found that the fourth neutrino can be naturally heavy while the other three obtain their masses at one loop , with the result that these masses can be tiny provided some ratios of masses of particles which participate in the loop integration are `` large '' , _ regardless _ of their actual values .",
    "this is interesting because , as we shall see below , some of the particles which participate in the loop integration , in particular the lightest ones , can have masses as low as a few hundred gevs and which could provide a direct test of this model .",
    "we will also see that , in order to obtain very small neutrino masses , at least one of the particles needs to be much heavier than the lightest one- a result which is somewhat reminescent of the see - saw mechanism .",
    "we will also see that the mass of the light neutrinos is intrinsically tied to the extra global symmetry present in the scalar sector of the model .",
    "in fact , the extra nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons which are not absorbed by the ( family and @xmath8 ) gauge bosons acquire a mass due to the presence of the gauge - invariant `` cross - coupling '' terms in the potential which explicitely break the extra global symmetry .",
    "the above brief statement will be made clearer in the discussion of neutrino masses .",
    "notice , in particular , that the result given for light neutrino masses in @xcite is only a very special case of the present discussion .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , the model is presented with a description of the gauge structure along with its particle content .",
    "it is shown how a new symmetry prevents neutrinos from obtaining a mass unless it is broken .",
    "next , the special properties of this extra symmetry associated with the right - handed neutrinos are discussed . in particular ,",
    "if that symmetry is a chiral @xmath0 as is the case in this paper , nontrivial constraints coming from the nonperturbative witten anomaly @xcite can be applied to the nature of the number of families .",
    "this is the extra bonus mentioned above .",
    "the paper then proceeds to discuss the generation of light neutrino masses , principally by radiative corrections of the type mentioned above .",
    "it is then followed by a discussion of the neutrino mass matrix . in particular",
    ", we will present the correlation between the values of the neutrino masses and @xmath7 .",
    "most importantly , we will show how @xmath7 increases or decreases with the masses themselves , with two resulting implications : either one has hdm _ and _ msw or vacuum solution and _ no _ hdm .",
    "either of these solutions will have an important cosmological implication .",
    "we end the paper with a brief discussion of the charged lepton mass matrix , the primary purpose of which being the wish to complete the discussion by presenting some examples on what the oscillation angles might look like .",
    "a followed - up paper will deal seperately with the charged lepton sector and , as a consequence , with a full discussion of the angles .",
    "we would like to emphasize for the purpose of clarity that the charged lepton sector ( which will be dealt with in a separate paper ) is different in structure from the neutrino sector , as we shall see below , and does not have the same hierarchical structure .",
    "the fact that , in this model , the three light neutrinos are nearly degenerate does not imply that it would be the same in the charged lepton sector . in fact , it is not as we will show in a subsequent paper .",
    "finally , a section will be devoted to various other phenomenological implications of the model .",
    "we shall assume throughout this paper the existence of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "since this manuscript is meant to be comprehensive , and hence lengthy , one could skip the three subsections of the next section , after first reading its introduction.(its reading is nevertheless recommended because the physics motivations are discussed there . )",
    "it is well - known that all that is needed to give neutrinos a mass is to simply add extra right - handed neutrinos to the standard model .",
    "one can then construct a ( dirac ) mass term with an arbitrary yukawa coupling , @xmath9 , which can be made to be as small as one wishes .",
    "this , of course , is unsatisfactory because , if neutrinos have masses in the @xmath10 range or less , this would require the yukawa coupling , @xmath11 , to be of o(@xmath5 ) or less .",
    "fine tuning to such a precision is normally considered to be unnatural . at this point",
    ", one might be tempted to try to explain this fact by simply invoking a fourth generation with a democratic mass matrix , at least for the neutrinos , as has been done by ref .",
    "the diagonalization of the neutrino mass matrix would then give one heavy eigenstate and three massless states . by adding some arbitrary phases to the mass matrix",
    ", one can `` provide '' a small mass ( depending on the values of those phases ) to the three neutrinos .",
    "this purely phenomenological ansatz ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) appears to `` fit '' the recent data on neutrino oscillations with the appropriate _ choices _ of the phases .",
    "however , the fourth generation lepton masses came out to be extremely heavy and split , which practically seems to be ruled out by analyses of precision experiments @xcite .    in @xcite , a model of dirac neutrino masses",
    "was constructed and based on a four generation scenario that was very different from the democratic ansatz made in @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for using such a scenario is the fact that , as of the present time , a fourth generation is _ not _ ruled out by experiment and , as a consequence , it is interesting to explore its possible implications .",
    "a recent review @xcite gave a comprehensive discussion of various topics concerning quarks and leptons beyond the third generation , including the present experimental status and future searches .",
    "if a fourth generation were to be used in the investigation of neutrino masses , one should keep in mind various phenomenological constraints concerning not only leptons but also quarks .",
    "for instance , constraints on the @xmath12 parameter limit the mass splitting within each doublet of extra quarks and leptons : the up and down members of a fourth generation should be very close in mass",
    ". they should be long - lived enough to escape present detection .",
    "this , in turns , tells us something about the mixing between the fourth generation and the other three .",
    "all of these issues have been described in @xcite . in the construction of the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , these phenomenological constraints were kept in mind .    as mentioned briefly in the introduction , our approach , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , is based on a dynamical justification for for the small value of the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "the question that was asked was : could there be a scenario in which a symmetry appears as one lets the yukawa coupling go to zero ?",
    "the tiny yukawa coupling which would give the neutrino a very small mass would then arise dynamically when that symmetry is broken .",
    "these yukawa couplings then appear as effective couplings which could be small for dynamical reasons and are not fundamental parameters that are put in by hand and which are needed to be fine tuned .",
    "what is the nature of that symmetry and how a dynamical yukawa coupling appears will be the subject of this section and the following two .",
    "it is obvious that an extension of the standard model(sm ) is needed in addressing the above issues .",
    "one simply can not stay solely within the sm if one wishes to deal with the mass of the neutrinos .",
    "what it is that one needs when one goes beyond the sm is a matter of taste , modulo a very obvious requirement : predictability of new phenomena or particles which can be tested .",
    "we first describe the model , presenting its gauge structure and representations .",
    "next , explanations are provided for the reasons behind the choices of the extended gauge group and its particle content .",
    "the crucial assumption here is the existence of two new symmetries , one of which will be particular to right - handed neutrinos , as alluded to earlier , and the other one is a family gauge symmetry . as we shall see below , it is the breaking of these new symmetries that will give a mass to the neutrinos .    in this work ,",
    "the sm is extended in the following way .",
    "generically , it takes the form : @xmath13 .",
    "why a `` family symmetry '' ? this is",
    "so for two reasons : a ) we wish to investigate the family replication problem and the mixing among different generations ; b ) the special symmetry endowed by the right - handed neutrinos might have some bearing on the family symmetry itself .",
    "after all , if one would like to investigate the family problem , some kind of family symmetry - be it discrete or continuous , global or gauge- is needed",
    ". why a special symmetry for the right - handed neutrinos ? the reasons were already expounded above : to provide a framework for an understanding of the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "our next task is then to determine what this special symmetry might be and what form the family symmetry might take .",
    "our model is described by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath8 are the family gauge group and the special gauge group for the right - handed neutrinos respectively .",
    "the particle content of the model is listed in table 1 .",
    "notice that we have denoted the right - handed neutrinos by @xmath16 because they are assumed to transform as doublets under @xmath8 .",
    "the two options listed for the right - handed neutrinos as well as the meaning of the non - standard particles will be discussed below .",
    "we would first like to explain the choices of the extra gauge groups . here",
    ", the extra symmetries are chosen to be _ gauge symmetries _ because , as it is well known , powerful constraints can be obtained from models built on the gauge assumption .",
    "let us first look at table 1 . in this model , all standard ( left - handed and right - handed ) particles are singlets under @xmath8 .",
    "hence the subscript @xmath17 . in this respect",
    ", @xmath8 is very different from @xmath18 of the popular left - right model @xcite . in that model ,",
    "right - handed quarks and leptons form doublets under @xmath18 , _ for every family_. because of our assignment , all weak interactions among standard particles are pure v - a , in contrast with the left - right model . what is the motivation behind our choice that makes it so different from the left - right model ? to answer that question , let us recall an interesting feature of chiral @xmath0 : the presence or absence of the so - called witten global anomaly .",
    "if chiral fermions transform as doublets under @xmath0 , there exists a nonperturbative anomaly- the so - called witten anomaly @xcite- associated with an _ odd _ number of doublets .",
    "briefly speaking , this is so because the fermionic determinant @xmath19 changes sign under a `` large '' gauge transformation @xmath20 if the number of chiral doublets is odd .",
    "this would make the partition function @xmath21 vanish and the theory would be ill - defined .",
    "this nonperturbative anomaly would then require the number of weyl doublets to be _ even _ in order for the theory to be consistent .",
    "( this ambiguity in sign stems from the fact that the fourth homotopy group @xmath22 . ) other groups that also have similar non - trivial constraints are @xmath23 for any @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "it is amusing to recall a well - known but forgotten fact about the sm .",
    "there the chiral gauge group is @xmath27 .",
    "each family contains one lepton and three quark doublets and , as such , is free from the global witten anomaly .",
    "( let us recall that the cancellation of the _ perturbative _ triangle anomaly in the sm only relates the lepton charge to that of the quark . )",
    "if , instead of three , the number of colors , @xmath28 , were arbitrary , the freedom from such an anomaly would require @xmath29 to be even , and hence , @xmath28 to be odd , namely @xmath28 = 3 , 5 , ...",
    "why nature choses @xmath30 instead of some other odd number is a question which can only be answered in the context of some deeper theory such as e.g. @xmath31 .",
    "although the witten anomaly does not fix the size of @xmath28 , it is nevertheless a powerful constraint in the sense that , _ once a fermion content is known _ ( e.g. one color singlet ( leptons ) and one fundamental representation ( quarks ) in the sm ) , @xmath28 is constrained ( e.g. odd in the case of the sm ) .",
    "the above simple lesson taught us something about the powerful constraint that a chiral @xmath0 exerts on the number of chiral doublets .",
    "this is the reason why it is chosen to be the special symmetry of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "let us contrast the constraint coming from @xmath8 with that coming from @xmath18 ( left - right model ) . for our model , with @xmath8 ,",
    "_ only _ @xmath32 transforms as doublets .",
    "absence from the witten anomaly then requires the number of such doublets to be _",
    "even_. if @xmath32 carries , in addition , family indices then the anomaly requirement restricts the number of generations to be _ even _ such as in option 1 as indicated in table 1 .",
    "if there exists an @xmath32 which is a family singlet ( denoted by @xmath33 ) , the number of generations would be _ odd _ such as in option 2 of table 1 .",
    "with the left - right model , _ each family _ contains four doublets of @xmath18 : @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the witten anomaly requirement is automatically satisfied _ per _ family .",
    "this is one of the few differences between our model and the left - right model .",
    "a final word of caution is in order here .",
    "although the witten anomaly constraint allows us to make a statement on the evenness or oddness of the number of generations- a subject to which we shall come back in the next subsection , it _ does not _ determine that number .",
    "this should come from a deeper and as - yet - unknown theory .",
    "our goal is much more modest : given a fermion content ( option 1 or 2 below ) , we can say whether or not the number of generations is odd or even , and that is all .",
    "we shall however try to constraint that number from a different route which is more phenomenological in nature , and point out the differences between option 1 and 2 .      in the construction of any model",
    ", there is a time - honored requirement : the absence of the perturbative triangle anomaly .",
    "even if the witten anomaly were absent , this requirement is a must for any gauge theory .",
    "( it just happens that , in the sm , both requirements are simultaneously satisfied . ) in our case , if a family index is assigned to all standard fermions _ and _ to @xmath32 , the family gauge group that is chosen can not be a vector - like theory , which is anomaly - free , because @xmath32 posseses an additional quantum number , that of @xmath8 .",
    "this is unlike qcd or even the left - right model if left and right - handed fermions carry similar family quantum numbers . a safe group and representations have to be chosen .",
    "the choice made in this paper is @xmath15 for the family gauge group , with chiral ( left- and right - handed ) fermions transforming as ( real ) vector representations with @xmath37 components each . as such , the model is also free of the perturbative triangle anomaly .",
    "our model based on @xmath38 with an _ even _ number of @xmath8- doublets and chiral fermions transforming as _ vector representations _ of @xmath15 is free from both nonperturbative and perturbative anomalies .      as shown in table 1 , there are two options for @xmath32 , each of which should contain an even number of @xmath8 doublets .",
    "\\a ) option 1 :    @xmath39 carries the family index @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "\\b ) option 2 :    here we have @xmath33 ( a family singlet ) and @xmath39 .",
    "the constraint is now @xmath42 even , which means that @xmath43 ( excluding the trivial case of 1 family ) .    unlike the sm where one knows the fermion content for each family ,",
    "i.e. quarks and leptons , and hence the nature of @xmath28- it is _",
    "odd_- our scenario involves incomplete experimental informations , and as such , the nature ( odd or even ) of @xmath37 can not be completely fixed .",
    "each choice , however , represents a distinct particle content ( no family singlets for the even option and one family singlet for the odd option ) which implies a possible distinct route for a yet - unknown unification .    recognizing the fact that there are deep differences between the even and odd options - a point to be discussed below- and in the absence of a deeper theory",
    ", one might wonder what can be done to narrow down the choices , not between odd or even , but within each option itself .",
    "below we present an argument that could help in finding a way to further restrict @xmath37 .",
    "this argument is only suggestive , being a combination of `` theoretical prejudice '' and phenomenological constraint .",
    "one might require that gauge couplings are free from landau singularities below the planck scale in such a way that unification of the sm gauge couplings , if it exists , occurs in the perturbative regime @xcite . with this criterion",
    ", one can see that the even option can only accomodate @xmath44 , while the odd option can only accomodate @xmath45 .",
    "this is because for @xmath46 , one or more gauge couplings will `` blow up '' before the planck scale .",
    "there are no reasons , in the absence of a deeper theory , to rule out any of the above choices .",
    "this will require other yet - unknown conditions .",
    "the only thing one can say , in the context of our model , is that electroweak precision experiments appear to rule out @xmath47 @xcite and and that existential facts tell us that @xmath37 is at least three .",
    "this leaves us with the choice @xmath48 for the even option and @xmath49 for the odd option .    if @xmath50 comes from the above argument , what then is the role of the witten anomaly in all of this ?",
    "it tells us about the particle content of the right - handed neutrinos . for @xmath37",
    "= 4 , the right - handed neutrinos are simply @xmath51 while for @xmath37 = 3 , one has @xmath52 plus a family singlet @xmath53",
    ". what observed differences can there be between these two options ? the former predicts the existence of a fourth generation whose consequences have been recently discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter predicts the existence of a neutral family - singlet @xmath54 ( doublet under @xmath8 ) which could have cosmological consequences of a yet - unknown nature .",
    "in addition , as we point out below , it appears that the even option prefers three almost degenerate light neutrinos while the odd option prefers a hierarchical structure for the light neutrinos .",
    "if a fourth generation is discovered , which alone does not necessarily imply the even option presented here , and if the light neutrino masses are convincingly `` proven '' to be nearly degenerate ( instead of a hierarchical structure ) , the even option might be viable .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see below , another possibility for testing this model is to look for signals of some of the lightest particles- the vector - like fermions- which participate in the loop diagram of fig .",
    "as discussed below , the light neutrino masses depend only on the ratios of these masses and not on their magnitudes and these vector - like fermions can be as light as a few hundred gevs .",
    "this section will be devoted to the discussion of how neutrino masses can be generated in our model for option 1 .",
    "we shall comment on option 2 at the end of the manuscript .",
    "we shall concentrate only on the lepton sector and , in particular , on the neutrino one , leaving the full discussion of the charged lepton and quark sectors for a subsequent publication .    since we will be dealing only with _ dirac _",
    "neutrino masses , we shall require that _ all _ fermions be endowed with a global @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "since we are concerned only with leptons in this section , a global @xmath56 symmetry is sufficient for the present purpose .",
    "this global @xmath56 symmetry would _ prevent _ a majorana mass term of the type @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "_ only dirac masses will be allowed_.    there might be other suggestive reasons as to why dirac masses for the neutrinos might be attractive .",
    "for example , a combined fit of massive neutrinos as components of hot dark matter ( hdm ) and atmospheric neutrino oscillations seems to prefer a scenario in which two or three light neutrinos are nearly degenerate and have mass in the o(ev ) range .",
    "recent data on neutrinoless double beta decay ( or absence thereof ) @xcite appear to rule out majorana neutrinos heavier than 0.2 ev , at least in the simplest versions . here",
    "it will be shown how , in our scenario , one can obtain three near - degenerate neutrinos whose mass can be of the order of a few ev s and is of the dirac type . consequently , in our model , there will be _ no _ neutrinoless double beta decay , and hence no contraint on the dirac neutrino masses from such a search .",
    "as we have discussed above , option 1 contains no family - singlet fermion field and freedom from the witten anomaly dictates that the number of families should be even .",
    "furthermore , we have argued that this even number should be four . as a result ,",
    "the gauge group for this option is : @xmath60 the reader is referred to table 1 for a list of particles that participate in this model .      without the extra vector - like fermions , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the only gauge - invariant yukawa coupling involving leptons",
    "would be @xmath65 , ( where @xmath66 is the family index ) , giving rise to equal masses for the charged leptons .",
    "unbroken @xmath67 forbids a similar term for the neutrinos and they remain massless at this level .",
    "( notice that , since we are only interested in dirac neutrino masses , a gauge - invariant majorana mass term of the type @xmath57 is forbidden by @xmath56 symmetry . ) we _ know _ that the charged leptons are not degenerate in mass .",
    "we also _ know _ that the width of the z boson @xcite constrains the mass of the fourth neutrino to be larger than half the z mass .",
    "this is where the vector - like fermions listed in table 1 come in .",
    "because of their vector - like nature , they can have _ arbitrary _ gauge - invariant bare masses .",
    "it is seen below that some of these masses can be as low as a few hundreds gevs and are thus accessible to future experimental searches .",
    "the yukawa part of the lagrangian involving leptons can be written as @xmath68 the assumption of an unbroken @xmath56 symmetry forbids the presence of majorana mass terms as mentioned above .",
    "notice that the values of @xmath69 are arbitrary .",
    "what they might be will be the subject of the discussion presented below . after integrating out the @xmath62 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 fields ,",
    "the relevant part of the effective lagrangian below @xmath69 reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 this is a tree - level effective lagrangian whose consequences are now presented .",
    "let us discuss the implication of each term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lag2 ] ) .",
    "as stated in the preceding paragraph , the first term gives rise to equal masses for the charged leptons .",
    "the second term would lift the degeneracy of the charged lepton sector once @xmath74 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the third term gives rise to a neutrino mass once _ both _ @xmath74 and @xmath12 acquire a vev .",
    "it is clear that , in our model , neutrino masses can appear only when _ both _ @xmath75 and @xmath8 are spontaneously broken while the charged lepton masses are non zero ( but equal ) even if @xmath75 is unbroken .",

    "we shall concentrate instead on the criteria for having small @xmath146 for arbitrary @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( and @xmath144 and @xmath64 as well ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "a few comments are in order here .",
    "first of all , as we have mentioned above , our results depend on ratios of the four masses which enter the loop integral : @xmath144 , @xmath118 , @xmath117 , and @xmath64 .",
    "one can symbolically denote one of the masses as @xmath147 , and the other three will be multiples of that chosen one .",
    "which one should be chosen is a matter of convenience and phenomenological interest . in particular , we choose @xmath148 because there is a possibility that the vector - like fermions @xmath62 could be detected if their masses are low enough .    a glance at figs .",
    "2 - 5 reveal that it is relatively easy to obtain a very small ratio @xmath149 .",
    "in particular , one can see that large values of @xmath64 , the mass of the singlet fermion field @xmath71 , are sufficient to obtain small values for @xmath149 . for instance",
    ", one can see that , roughly speaking , @xmath150 when @xmath151 ( in units of @xmath144 ) .",
    "although conceptually quite different , the above fact is very reminescent of the see - saw mechanism in that there is one large scale : majorana for see - saw , @xmath64 for this scenario , and one `` small '' scale : dirac mass @xmath3 for see - saw , @xmath144 for this scenario .",
    "the important point that we wish to make is the fact that the general result obtained here , namely the smallness of light neutrino masses , does not depend on one particular combination of masses which would imply fine tuning , a point which was not made quite clear in ref .",
    "@xcite , but only on `` large '' ratio of masses whatever they might be . in this sense ,",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses in our scenario is no less natural than the ones obtained from the see - saw mechanism .    in figs . 2 - 5",
    ", we show the results for the case @xmath152 .",
    "there is , of course , absolutely no reason for this ordering .",
    "it is a matter of presentation .",
    "we obtain exactly the same results with the roles of @xmath64 and @xmath117 reversed . as can be inferred from the figures , for a given value of @xmath118 ( @xmath153 ) , @xmath150 if the ratio @xmath154 is below a certain value .",
    "for example , for @xmath155 , one has @xmath156 , while for @xmath157 , one has @xmath158 .",
    "what this says is that the larger the mass is ( e.g. @xmath117 ) , the less mass splitting is needed in order to have a small @xmath159 .    at this stage",
    ", we can only say that @xmath146 can be very small .",
    "what we can not say is exactly what its value should be .",
    "this should come from some deeper theory .",
    "instead , we shall use present constraints to restrict the range of values for @xmath160 .",
    "having seen how one can obtain _ very _ small @xmath146 , the next question would be : how small can one allow @xmath146 to be if one takes into account the neutrino oscillation data ?",
    "first of all , atmospheric neutrino oscillation data gives a difference of mass squared @xmath161 while solar neutrino oscillation data gave @xmath162 ( msw ) or @xmath163 ( vacuum ) .",
    "in anticipation of new data , the lsnd results are not taken into account in our rough estimation of various mass scales . without any need for a specific model",
    ", one can say that the atmospheric data implies that at least one of the three neutrinos should have a mass of _ at least _",
    "@xmath164 , while the solar data implies that at least one of the remaining two should have a mass of _ at least _ @xmath165 ( msw ) or @xmath166 ( vacuum ) . as we have seen above",
    ", the 4th neutrino can be quite heavy .",
    "for the sake of argument , let us assume here that its mass is approximately 100 gev",
    ". since our three light neutrinos are practically degenerate -a lifting of which will be discussed below , the atmospheric data alone constrains @xmath159 to be greater than approximately @xmath167 .",
    "this in turn constrains @xmath168 ( in units of @xmath144 ) for the case @xmath169 , or @xmath170 for the reverse case .",
    "notice that this rough estimate is only for illustration purpose .",
    "there is however one interesting piece of information which could be quite interesting , phenomenologically speaking : the presence of vector - like fermions which carry weak quatum numbers and which could be relatively `` light '' .",
    "these are the fermions @xmath62 with mass @xmath144 as indicated above .",
    "let us recall from the above discussions that @xmath160 are all expressed in units of @xmath144 which itself could take on any value , even a few hundreds of gev .",
    "the sole restriction will be from experimental constraints , a subject to which we shall come back below .",
    "furthermore , we can see from the results that the mass of the pseudo - ng bosons can also be `` low '' as well ( fig.1 ) which could provide a further experimental clue .",
    "we now turn to an important issue : the lifting of the mass degeneracy of the light neutrinos .",
    "the analysis presented below will reveal quite interesting implications such as the correlation between the actual values of the masses and @xmath7 , which can have a profound cosmological consequence . for neutrino masses which are large enough to provide part of hdm , the msw solution of the solar neutrino problem is preferred .",
    "if the vacuum solution turns out to be the correct one , the neutrino masses will be much too light in our scenario to play a role in hdm .",
    "we shall divide the discussion presented below into two parts .",
    "first we analyze the case when there is no mixing between the 4th neutrino and the lighter three .",
    "it will be seen that an interesting feature emerges : @xmath171-a quasi - symmetric splitting .",
    "( @xmath172 is of the same order . )",
    "this phenomenon could be called a mass splitting quasi - degeneracy .",
    "of course , solar and atmospheric neutrino data suggest otherwise .",
    "next , we will show how this mass splitting quasi - degeneracy can be lifted , suggesting- at least in our scenario - the presence of a 4th neutrino .    in what follows , we will neglect any possible cp phase in the neutrino mass matrix since we will be concerned only with @xmath7 and present data on neutrino oscillations are not sensitive to the presence of such a phase .",
    "in addition , we shall concentrate in the next two subsections only on @xmath7 .",
    "a full comparison with the data will necessitate the inclusion of the leptonic `` ckm '' angles coming from @xmath173 .",
    "in the two subsections presented below , we shall see what @xmath174 might look like . to complete the discussion",
    ", we shall use a model for @xmath175 in order to make some statements about the size of the mixing angles .",
    "the subject of the charged lepton mass matrix itself will be dealt with in a subsequent publication .",
    "the @xmath61 neutrino mass matrix obtained at this point is purely _",
    "diagonal_. we would like to examine how mass mixing might arise .",
    "in particular , we would like to lift the degeneracy of the three light neutrinos . in this section",
    "we will concentrate on the scenario where there is mass mixing only among the three light neutrinos .",
    "we will show that , in this scenario , @xmath171 .",
    "if this were experimentally the case , it would be hard to detect the influence of the 4th neutrino since it does not mix with the other three . since the atmostpheric and solar data appear to point to @xmath176 , we will present in the next section what can be done in order to be in agreement with the data .",
    "it turns out that this can be accomplished if one introduces a mixing with the 4th neutrino .",
    "this implies that , at least in our model , @xmath176 implies the existence of a 4th neutrino , and hence a 4th generation .",
    "the degeneracy of the three light neutrinos at this level comes from the fact that there is a remaining global @xmath177 symmetry which manifests itself through the equality of the masses of the family gauge bosons ( @xmath117 ) as well as those of the pseudo - ng bosons ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "it is then clear that one needs to break that remaining global symmetry in order to remove the degeneracy of the light neutrino masses .",
    "we would want to do this in such a way as to preserve the quasi - degeneracy of the light neutrinos .",
    "there are probably several ways to achieve this , and we will present one of them here .",
    "since we have seen how the diagonal elements of the neutrino mass matrix for the three light neutrinos are obtained at the one loop level , it is natural to envision a scenario in which the mixings themselves are obtained at _",
    "one loop_. a look at figs .",
    "1 reveals that the most `` straightforward '' way to induce mixings at one loop is for @xmath110 and/or @xmath114 to have mixed couplings , i.e. to both @xmath178 and @xmath179 as well as to both @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "this could come from mixings among @xmath110 with different family indices and/or the mixings among @xmath114 . before getting into the details of what kinds of interactions are needed to break the remaining global @xmath177 symmetry and hence inducing the mixings , it is instructional to assume that such a mixing among the boson masses occurs and to write down the yukawa couplings ( [ yuka2],[yuka3 ] ) in terms of the new boson mass eigenstates .",
    "let us first look at the states @xmath110 . as we have discussed earlier , these are the ng bosons which are absorbed by the corresponding family gauge bosons . when these ng bosons get mixed , there will be mass mixings among the corresponding family gauge bosons .",
    "let us denote the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes these family gauge bosons by @xmath182 .",
    "we shall choose the following representation for @xmath182 : @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 represent the cosine and sine .",
    "if we denote by @xmath186 the logitudinal components of the gauge boson mass eigenstates , its relationship with @xmath110 in the unmixed case is given by @xmath187 where @xmath188 is given by @xmath189 the masses of the corresponding gauge bosons are now denoted by @xmath190 where @xmath191 can be positive or negative .",
    "notice that @xmath191 and the mixing angles shown above are _ related _ , i.e. they are all derived from the same boson mass matrix .",

    "( the lifting of the mass splitting degeneracy to satisfy the atmospheric neutrino data will not change this conclusion . )",
    "this simply means that , at least in this model , the solar vacuum solution is incompatible with the light neutrinos being significant components of hdm .",

    "( 8 , 9 , 10 ) , it can be seen that the msw solution , @xmath303 , can correspond to values of @xmath290 larger than 1 @xmath10 .",
    "( again , the lifting of the mass splitting degeneracy to satisfy the atmospheric neutrino data will not change this conclusion . )",
    "so , in our scenario , the msw solution is compatible with the light neutrinos being significant components of hdm while the vacuum solution is not .",

    "does not appear to add much to the discussion . although it might be possible that a more involved ansatz than ( [ gpmatrix ] ) could lead to the lifting of the mass splitting `` quasi - degeneracy '' , we have not succeeded in finding it .",
    "for this reason , we now turn our attention to the more appealing scenario , at least within our model : the mixing between the 4th neutrino and the rest .",
    "we have seen above that the simple ansatz for the boson mass matrices ( [ gpmatrix ] ) leads to a situation in which the mass splittings are quasi - degenerate .",
    "this , of course , is in contradiction with the data . in this model , in order to lift that quasi - degeneracy , one needs a mixing between the 4th neutrino and at least one of the lighter three . to get a feel for",
    "what might be needed , we shall first present a few numerical examples .",

    ", we shall choose : @xmath318 .",
    "( a smaller value of @xmath258 will give a smaller mass splitting . )",
    "the reason for this choice ( other choices are _ equally valid _ ) is the fact that it will give a typical mass of approximately 1.5 ev and a desired mass splitting . putting these values into the expressions for the integrals as given by eq.([int2 ] ) , we obtain the following neutrino mass matrix , where @xmath124 is assumed to be 100 gev for convenience : @xmath319 notice that the above matrix has no mixing between the 4th neutrino and the lighter three .",
    "the eigenvalues are just : @xmath320 @xmath321 where @xmath322 .",
    "let us now assume that the mixing with the 4th neutrino is non - zero .",
    "we start out with the _ simplest assumption _ , namely one in which only the 3rd neutrino mixes with the 4th one .",
    "this means that @xmath323 and @xmath324 are both non - vanishing .",
    "if we wish to have @xmath325 as suggested by the atmospheric neutrino data , it turns out that @xmath323 and @xmath324 can not be too small nor too large , being of order @xmath326 .",
    "notice that @xmath323 and @xmath324 do not have to be equal .",
    "we shall see how it might be possible to obtain such a number .",

    "now the two unchanged eigenvalues will be the ones that fix one of the two mass splittings , @xmath7 . for convenience",
    ", we shall choose the @xmath7 corresponding to the unmodified mass eigenvalues as the one which corresponds to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "as we have learned from the above analysis in section ( [ matrix1 ] ) , if one chooses the msw solution , then one can find masses which are large enough for hdm , while , if the vacuum solution is chosen , the masses will be too small to form any significant component of hdm .",
    "for the numerical example given here , we shall choose the msw solution as shown above .",

    "also , for nothing more than a numerical example , the values of @xmath333 were chosen arbitrarily in order to have the desired mass splitting . how to justify these values",

    "( [ unu ] ) ( apart from a difference in in the overall sign ) , namely @xmath423 although ref .",

    "( [ unu ] ) .",
    "one can easily imagine how these angles can drastically change if the charged lepton mass matrix has a different texture",
    ". this will be the subject of a subsequent paper where we will examine the charged lepton mass matrix in the context of the present model- the basic interaction lagrangian being already given by eq .",
    "( [ lag1 ] ) .",
    "the above discussions focused entirely on the atmospheric and solar neutrino data . we have left out the lsnd @xcite result for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is because it might be prudent to wait for future experiments , either to confirm or to refute these results .",
    "secondly , it is because it is extremely hard to incorporate _ all three _ experiments simultaneously in a `` natural '' model . in general , one needs to invoke some kind of sterile neutrino that mixes with the lightest neutrino to explain the solar data . if this sterile neutrino were to arise from some kind of model , it is rather hard to invent , in a `` natural '' way , a scenario to explain why this sterile neutrino is so light and close in mass to one of the three active light neutrinos .",
    "let us suppose that the lsnd result are verified by future experiments .",
    "what does the model presented in this paper have to say about a sterile neutrino ?",
    "let us remember that @xmath438 is an electroweak _",

    "its @xmath8 partner , @xmath441 , remains massless , at least within the framework of the preceding sections .",
    "could these be the so - called sterile neutrinos ?",

    "we have concentrated in this manuscript on the even option .",
    "one might wonder about the odd option and its implication on neutrino masses .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate this issue , however a preliminary investigation of the odd option , with three families and one family singlet @xmath442 , appears to indicate that the preferred solution for the neutrino masses is that in which there is a hierarchy @xmath443 .",
    "there are numerous phenomenological consequences to be worked out in subsequent publications .",
    "one can , however , make one rather solid prediction : neutrinos , being of the dirac nature , will not give rise to the phenomenon of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "another interesting consequence is the possible existence of `` light '' ( i.e. 200 gev or so ) vector - like fermions : @xmath62 , as well as tev - scale pseudo ng bosons which carry family and @xmath8 quatum numbers .",
    "this will be dealt with in a separate paper .",
    "several other phenomenological issues remain to be investigated .",
    "for instance , what are the consequences of a broken @xmath67 and what might the cosmological implications of @xmath444 s and @xmath54 be ? when @xmath67 is broken by @xmath445 , the gauge bosons are expected to acquire a mass of o(@xmath446 ) and can be quite heavy .",
    "since only _ right - handed _",
    "neutral leptons participate in @xmath67 interactions , a place where the effects of those gauge bosons might show up is in the decays of neutrinos . without going into detail ,",
    "it is easy to see that the decay of the light ( near - degenerate ) neutrinos into each other is completely negligible for lack of phase space and for the fact that neutrino masses are _ tiny _ compared with @xmath446 ( even if the latter is in the tev region ) .",
    "this leaves us with the decay of the ( heavy ) fourth - generation neutral lepton @xmath24 for which we have @xmath447 ( 1 ) via the exchange of @xmath67 gauge bosons , and @xmath448 ( 2 ) if @xmath449 or @xmath450 ( 3 ) if @xmath451 .",
    "in addition , one could have @xmath452 when @xmath453 , via the exchange of @xmath454 .",
    "whether or not @xmath124 is larger or smaller than @xmath455 , the relevant decays to compare with each other are ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) . to make an estimate ,",
    "let us assume the the family gauge coupling is about the same size as the electroweak coupling ( @xmath456 ) .",
    "the ratio of the decay widths for ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) is approximately @xmath457 , where @xmath458 represent the mass of the @xmath8 gauge bosons and @xmath254 represents the mixing cofficient between the 4th neutrino and a light charged lepton .",
    "now let us remember that the computation of the neutrino masses does not involve @xmath458 and as a result there appears to be no constraint there .",
    "however , @xmath459 and @xmath460 , and as a result @xmath461 . in the second example discussed in the previous example , @xmath462 ( with @xmath463 ) which implies @xmath464 .",
    "now @xmath465 can also be appreciable if @xmath124 is close to @xmath466 .",
    "for example , if @xmath467 and @xmath468 , @xmath469 provided @xmath470 .",
    "if this were the case , the signal would be quite interesting : a long - lived massive neutral lepton whose electroweak decay width is not what it should be .",
    "it is certainly beyond the scope of this paper to explore numerous phenomenological consequences which might arise from our scenario .",
    "as for the cosmological consequences of @xmath444 s and @xmath54 , if they are massless , one should recall our earlier discussion : these particles _ only _ have family and @xmath67 gauge interactions ( both for @xmath471 s and the latter only for @xmath54 ) . therefore , they _ can not _ influence big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "one can estimate their decoupling temperatures by comparing the interaction rate @xmath472 , where @xmath473 , with the hubble rate @xmath474 .",
    "decoupling occurs when @xmath475 which gives a temperature of o(@xmath476 ) gev if @xmath477 gev for example .",
    "after this , their temperature would scale like @xmath478 .",
    "it is not clear what else they can do except to exist as almost non- interacting relativistic relics with an energy density negligible compared with normal matter . at this stage , it is also not clear if they really do need to have a mass .",
    "the cosmology of these objects is probably worth exploring further .",
    "another interesting cosmological subject to explore is the `` heaviest '' particle in our scenario : the vector - like neutral fermion @xmath71 which is singlet under all the listed gauge groups in eq .",
    "( [ gaugegroup ] ) .",
    "@xmath4 couples to other fermions via [ lag1 ] .",
    "the decay modes obtained from ( [ lag1 ] ) are : @xmath479 ( 1 ) and @xmath480 ( 2 ) . notice that , in the examples given above for the calculations of the neutrino masses , the mass of this fermion is typically @xmath481 .",
    "so , if @xmath482 ( or a few hundred gev ) , one would then expect the mass of @xmath483 to be around a few times @xmath484 gev .",
    "if @xmath485 , @xmath483 would have a mass around @xmath486 gev .",
    "the questions that we would like to investigate are : ( 1 ) how many @xmath487 are left in the present universe?;(2 ) could the decay of the relic @xmath488 s manifest itself as ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr)(with energy exceeding @xmath489 ) whose origins are still unknown ? it does appear that the mass of @xmath483 is in the right energy ballpark .",
    "this would be the case of a non - accelerated source of uhecr and is part of the `` top - down '' approach to uhecr @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath490 would decay into the longitudinal component of @xmath454 ( @xmath491 ) and @xmath492 .",
    "@xmath491 would in turn decay into extremely high - energy quarks and leptons .",
    "the quarks will hadronize into hadrons such as pions which will eventually convert into photons , neutrinos , etc ..",
    "last but not least , in the subsequent series of papers , we shall deal with the charged lepton sector and with the quark sector .",
    "in particular , we shall see how the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ lag1 ] ) to the quark sector might yield interesting results .",
    "i would like to thank vernon barger , paul fishbane and paul frampton for reading the manuscript and for useful comments .",
    "this work is supported in parts by the us department of energy under grant no .",
    "de - a505 - 89er40518 .",
    "in this appendix , we shall discuss a simple form of the higgs potential for the group @xmath493 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume that there is no cross coupling between ( @xmath74 , @xmath12 ) and the sm higgs field @xmath494 .",
    "( one might wonder about the fact that even if the cross coupling were vanishing , it might still be induced through radiative corrections .",
    "this , however , would be very small in our model . )    the potential containing @xmath74 and @xmath12 reads @xmath495 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda_{4 } [ ( \\omega^{\\alpha } \\omega_{\\alpha } ) ( \\rho^{\\dagger\\ , \\beta } \\rho_{\\beta } ) -(\\omega^{\\alpha } \\rho^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha})(\\omega^{\\beta } \\rho_{\\beta } ) \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 , with @xmath78 . here",
    ", we will assume that @xmath74 is real and @xmath12 is complex .",
    "we will be particularly interested in the mass eigenstates resulting from eq .",
