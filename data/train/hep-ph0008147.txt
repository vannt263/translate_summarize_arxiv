    "with the recent advances in the hamiltonian renormalization program , light - front dynamics ( lfd ) appears to be a promising technique to impose the relativistic treatment of hadrons . in lfd",
    "a fock - space expansion of bound states is made to handle the relativistic many - body effects in a consistent way @xcite .",
    "the wave function @xmath3 describes the component with @xmath4 constituents , with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath5 , perpendicular momentum @xmath6 and helicity @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "it is the aim of lfd to determine those wave functions and use them in conjunction with hard scattering amplitudes to describe the properties of hadrons and their response to electroweak probes .",
    "important steps were taken towards a realization of this goal@xcite . however , at present there are no realistic results available for wave functions of hadrons based on qcd alone . in order to calculate the response of hadrons to external probes",
    ", one might resort to the use of model wave functions .",
    "the variational principle enabled the solution of a qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian and the constructed lf quark - model provided a good description of the available experimental data spanning various meson properties @xcite . the same reasons that make lfd so attractive to solve bound - state problems in field theory make it also useful for a relativistic description of nuclear systems .",
    "presently , it is realized that a parametrization of nuclear reactions in terms of non - relativistic wave functions must fail .",
    "lf methods have the advantage that they are formally similar to time - ordered many - body theories , yet provide relativistically invariant observables . furthermore ,",
    "as far as the concerned amplitude is unconditionally ( or absolutely ) convergent , the lf hamiltonian approach must yield the same result as the one obtained by a covariant feynman approach .",
    "however , not all is well .",
    "as we have recently shown@xcite , the amplitudes that are only conditionally convergent must be treated with care . a case in point discussed in our work@xcite",
    "was the calculation of a current matrix element in quantum field theory .",
    "a typical amplitude is given by the triangle diagram .",
    "one encounters this diagram e.g. when computing the meson form factor ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0.1](a ) ) .",
    "the vertices denoted by @xmath9 are coupling constants in covariant perturbation theory .",
    "the hard scattering process is the absorption of a photon of momentum @xmath10 by a ( anti-)quark . in the lfd approach the covariant amplitude is replaced by a series of lf time - ordered diagrams . in the case of the triangle diagram",
    "they are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig0.1](b ) and  1(c ) . the first ( fig .",
    "[ fig0.1](b ) ) of these two diagrams is easily interpreted in terms of the lf wave functions @xmath11 .",
    "however , the other diagram ( fig .  [ fig0.1](c ) ) has one vertex that can again be written in the same way as before , but it contains also another vertex , denoted by @xmath12 , that can not be written as a lf wave function . the necessity of this new element @xmath12 in lfd has also been discussed in the cases of semileptonic meson decays@xcite and deeply virtual compton scattering@xcite .",
    "one may call @xmath11 and @xmath12 the vertices of leading order and non - leading order , respectively , in the sense that the leading order vertex corresponds to the lowest fock - state whereas the non - leading order vertex takes into account the higher fock - states . the diagrams with @xmath12",
    "are designated as _ nonvalence _",
    "diagrams while those with vertices of type @xmath11 only are designated as _ valence _ diagrams . in order to obtain the invariant form factor , the two lf form factors must be added .",
    "it depends on the situation whether one can limit oneself to a single component of the current @xmath13 to extract the invariant objects . for",
    "the electromagnetic current of a spin-0 particle any single component would suffice to extract the unique form factor . on the other hand , in situations like semileptonic pseudoscalar meson decay , which involves two independent form factors , or the electromagnetic current of a ( axial-)vector particle that is described by three independent form factors , one must use information from several current components to determine the invariant amplitudes .",
    "earlier , we presented an analysis of contributions from the nonvalence diagrams@xcite .",
    "we constructed both leading and non - leading order vertices using pointlike covariant ones .",
    "the model that we used was essentially an extension of mankiewicz and sawicki s @xmath14-dimensional quantum field theory model @xcite , which was later reinvestigated by several others @xcite . while their model@xcite was a simple 1 + 1 dim .",
    "scalar field theory , it included a binding effect of the two - body bound - state . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relativistic two - body bound - state form factor was discussed in the full range of the binding energy .",
    "the starting model wave function was the solution of the covariant bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation with a relativistic version of the contact interaction @xcite .",
    "the covariant model wave function was a product of two free single particle propagators , the overall momentum - conserving dirac delta function , and a constant vertex function .",
    "consequently , all our form factor calculations were various ways of evaluating the feynman triangle diagram in quantum field theory . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the elastic electromagnetic form factors of a bound - state computed from the triangle diagram and from the hamiltonian front - form dynamics are the same@xcite . since our aim was to analyze the taxonomy of the triangle diagram , we did nt choose any particular gauge for the electromagnetic gauge field but presented the equivalence of the physical form factor @xmath15 in any choice of the electromagnetic gauge , see m. morara , r. soldati , and g. mccartor , aip conference proceedings @xmath16 , 284 - 290 ( 1999 ) . ] or in any choice of the current component .",
    "our conditionally convergent example of lfd with a fermion - loop showed that the bad component of the current , @xmath17 , with spin-1/2 constituents exhibits a persistent end - point singularity in the contribution from the nonvalence diagram@xcite . however , the calculation carried out so far was semi - realistic as the model was 1 + 1 dimensional and only a point - vertex was considered .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend our analysis of the fermion - loop to the case of 3 + 1 dimensions . in 3 + 1 dimensions both the covariant and the lf calculations are divergent and the model without any smeared vertex for the fermion loop is not well defined . in the recent literature@xcite , the fermion - loop was regulated by smearing the @xmath18 bound - state vertex in a covariant manner . however , the vertex function was not symmetric in the four momenta of the constituent quarks and could hardly be considered a realistic approximation of a @xmath19 bound state .",
    "it was regarded only as a convenient cutoff prescription which makes the one - loop integrals finite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of the meson decay constant reveals that the end - point singularity is not completely cancelled by such an asymmetric choice of the vertex function .",
    "( see the next section for more details . )",
    "we show in this work that the fermion - loop can also be regulated by taking a non - local gauge - boson vertex . with this method satisfying the ward - takahashi ( w - t ) identity@xcite",
    ", we found the complete cancellation of the end - point singularity not only in the electromagnetic form factor but also in the decay constant .",
    "the non - local gauge - boson vertex remedies also the conceptual difficulty associated with the asymmetric way of treating @xmath10 and @xmath20 in the previous calculations@xcite .    nevertheless , one should distinguish the bound - state from the confined - state . in this work , we are treating the mesons as bound - states rather than confined - states , because we do not yet know how to make a covariant regularization for the confined - state .",
    "thus , our emphasis here is the inclusion of the non - leading order vertex rather than the model - building of a realistic meson wavefunction .",
    "we have performed the lf calculation in parallel to the covariant feynman calculation .",
    "our light - front results entail the similarity between the vertex - smearing - technique ( either for the bound - state vertex or the gauge - boson vertex ) and the pauli - villars regularization .",
    "for the bosonic loop calculation , the two methods turn out to be identical .",
    "however , for the fermionic loop calculation , the vertex - smearing - technique shares only the same structure of the denominators with the pauli - villars regularization . using the gauge - boson vertex - smearing technique , we found that the persistent end - point singularity is removed even if the smeared - vertex is taken to the limit of the point - vertex .",
    "a significant entity of our work is the taxonomy of valence and non - valence contributions substantiating the finiteness of each contribution when the gauge - boson vertex is regulated .",
    "our results satisfy current conservation .",
    "however , we note that each contribution individually depends on the reference - frame even though the sum is always frame - independent .",
    "we thus elaborate the frame - dependence of individual contributions . also , the zero - mode contribution should be distinguished from the instantaneous contribution . for the numerical estimates of physical observables ,",
    "we present the electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath21 , and @xmath2 mesons .    in the next section ( section  [ sec.2 ] )",
    ", we present both the covariant feynman calculations and the lf calculations using the lf energy integration for the electromagnetic form factors of a pseudoscalar meson with spin-1/2 constituents .",
    "section  [ sec.6 ] contains the numerical taxonomy of both the valence and nonvalence diagrams to the electromagnetic form factors of @xmath21 and @xmath2-mesons .",
    "the conclusion and discussion follow in section  [ sec.7 ] .",
    "the general formula including unequal mass cases are summarized in appendix a and the analytic behavior of the valence and nonvalence contributions at @xmath22 limit in various frames is summarized in appendix b.",
    "the electromagnetic form factors can be extracted from the matrix elements of the current @xmath13 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the charge of the meson and @xmath25 is the square of the four momentum transfer . if one uses the plus - component , @xmath26 , the lf calculation gives two finite contributions , the _ lf valence form factor _ and the _ lf nonvalence form factor _ , that add up to the covariant result , as expected .",
    "the importance of the nonvalence contribution varies strongly with the momentum transfer and depends sensitively on the binding energy of the meson . for small values of @xmath27 and small binding energy ,",
    "the valence part is dominant , but elsewhere the nonvalence diagram is essential for agreement between the lf calculation and the covariant results .",
    "the form factor can also be extracted from the minus - component of the current , @xmath28 .",
    "covariance guarantees that it makes no difference whether the form factor is determined using the plus or the minus current matrix element . as lfd is not manifestly covariant , it may happen that @xmath17 leads to a form factor different from the one determined using @xmath29 . as we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the matrix element of @xmath17 diverges even in 1 + 1 dimensional lfd . unless one regulates @xmath17",
    ", the current can not be conserved . to assure current conservation",
    ", it was crucial to identify the term that causes the divergence .",
    "we have identified this term exactly and found that it is an infinite function of the momentum transfer .",
    "if this infinite term is subtracted , the two lf contributions become finite as it must be in a conserved current . moreover",
    ", their sum equals again the covariant result as expected .",
    "still , the regularized lf contributions obtained from @xmath17 are different from the ones extracted from the plus current .",
    "the differences grow with increasing binding energy .",
    "the covariant fermion triangle - loop ( fig .  [ fig0.1](a ) ) in 3 + 1 dimension is divergent if all the vertices are point - like . in the recent literature@xcite ,",
    "the fermion - loop was regulated by smearing the @xmath18 bound - state vertex in a covariant manner .",
    "however , the vertex function used in refs.@xcite was not symmetric in the four momenta of the constituent quarks as we discussed in the introduction .",
    "we note that the conceptual difficulty associated with the asymmetry could be remedied if the cutoff prescription is used in the gauge - boson vertex rather than in the @xmath18 bound - state vertex . in fig .",
    "[ fig0.1](a ) , we thus replace the point photon - vertex @xmath30 by a non - local ( or smeared ) photon - vertex @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 plays the role of a momentum cut - off .",
    "our method is gauge invariant , and satisfies the w - t identity@xcite . even though we have computed the covariant amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig0.1](a ) ) with unequal constituent masses , for the clarity of presentation we will focus in this section on the equal mass case , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath34 .",
    "the basic formulas for the general case are given in the appendix .    the covariant amplitude ( fig .",

    "we note that one can split the denominators in eq .",
    "( [ eq.02 ] ) into four terms ( see below ) to show the similarity between the methods of photon - vertex - smearing and the pauli - villars regularization , namely the vertex - smearing - technique shares the same structure of the denominators with the pauli - villars regularization . to investigate the issue of the end - point singularity@xcite",

    "remarkably , we find that the nonvalence part of the minus current , which in this reference frame coincides with the zero - mode contribution , makes a very important contribution to the total form factor and may even dominate over the valence part in the whole @xmath79-range considered .",
    "there are quantitative differences between the results obtained for the different mesons , which are to large extent due to the difference in binding : the tighter the binding , the more important @xmath80 becomes .",
    "we checked the binding effect in the case of the pion . by varying the quark mass alone from the realistic value of @xmath81 gev to @xmath82 gev , thus lowering the binding energy to 0.1% of the pion mass",

    "the dominance of @xmath80 is so strong , that it can hardly be distinguished from the covariant form factor .",

    "in both the target - rest frame and the breit frame for @xmath95 the transferred momentum is purely transverse .",

    ", we verified that the vertex - smearing - technique is similar to the pauli - villars regularization . in the @xmath17 computation , we find that the critical smearing effect persists even in the limit to the point vertex because the end - point singularity existing otherwise is completely removed once the limit is taken at the end of the calculation . if the limit is taken at the beginning of the calculation , however , we have alreay shown that the end - point singularity in the nonvalence contribution leads to an infinitely different result from that obtained by the covariant feynman calculation  @xcite .",
    "our taxonomical analysis demonstrated that each individual contribution , whether valence or nonvalence , is finite regardless of which component of the current is considered .",
    "however , we stress that each contribution depends on the reference - frame even though the sum does not .",
    "of course , the invariance of the sum ensures the current conservation . also , the zero - mode contribution should be distinguished from the instantaneous contribution as we have numerically estimated the differences .",
    "> from our numerical calculations we can conclude that to obtain agreement with the covariant form factor one needs both the valence and the nonvalence parts . for tightly bound states the nonvalence parts dominate in an important part of the range of @xmath79-values that we studied .",
    "it is natural that this result runs counter to nonrelativistic intuition , which says that the valence parts should dominate , because the tightly bound states are not expected to be non - relativistic . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated in the 1 + 1-dimensional case , that by weakening the binding @xmath92 and @xmath83 approximate the covariant form factor more and more closely .",
    "here we found that indeed for less tightly bound state the valence parts come closer to the covariant result , but even at @xmath104 @xmath83 gives only 69% of the covariant form factor .",
    "if two reference frames can be connected by a kinematical lorentz transformation the lf form factors calculated in these two frames must be the same .",
    "otherwise they must differ .",
    "we found that the angle dependence within a chosen reference frame is always smooth , although it may be very strong .",
    "for some values of the polar angle @xmath87 two reference frames may be connected by a kinematical lorentz transformation , e.g. , the target - rest frame and the breit frame for @xmath90 . on the other hand , the dyw frame and the breit frame for @xmath105 are not connected by a kinematical transformation and the form factor components consequently do not coincide .",
    "more details of the frame - dependence can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    while the calculations carried out in this work is more realistic than the case of 1 + 1 dim with the point vertex , they are still semi - realistic as the model uses a bound - state rather than a confined - state . moreover , we used for the vertices those obtained from a bethe - salpeter equation using a contact interaction@xcite which are of zero range and may emphasize the importance of the nonvalence contributions rather differently from a more realistic model .",
    "thus , there is still much room for extending our model towards a more realistic model .",
    "however , the essential conclusions about the similarity to the pauli - villars regularization and the cancellations of both ultra - violet divergence and the end - point singularity remain intact .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical results may differ from a more realistic model calculation .",
    "this point is presently under investigation .",
    "this work was supported in part by a grant from the us department of energy and the national science foundation .",

    "blgb wants to thank the staff of the department of physics at ncsu for their warm hospitality during a stay when this work was completed .",

    "if we number the momenta of the internal lines of the fermion triangle as @xmath106 ( spectator ) , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 ( struck quark ) respectively , and the corresponding masses as @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 then we find for the trace appearing in the numerator of the covariant integral , the expression @xmath112 . \\label{eq0.01}\\ ] ] the valence diagram is obtained if one calculates the integral over @xmath113 by closing the contour around the pole corresponding to putting the spectator @xmath106 on shell .",
    "this corresponds to the following values for the minus - components of the momenta to be used in the expression for @xmath114 @xmath115 to obtain the nonvalence diagram one closes the contour around the pole corresponding to @xmath116 .",
    "then one gets for the part of the propagator with the mass @xmath111 @xmath117 for the part of the propagator with the cutoff @xmath118 the same formula can be used , but with @xmath111 replaced by @xmath118 .",
    "as the smearing we use affects only the denominator parts of the propagator of the struck quark , the replacement of @xmath111 by @xmath118 in @xmath114 occurs only in the minus components .",
    "the energy denominators are easy to find .",
    "one obtains for the valence parts @xmath119 the nonvalence part has the same denominator @xmath120 , but @xmath121 is changed to @xmath122 the energy denominators @xmath123 and @xmath124 are obtained by the substitutions @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .    in the case where @xmath127 and @xmath128 the final formulas are much simplified .",
    "the explicit formulas in the main text are valid for the equal - mass case . the general case can be easily constructed from the expressions ( [ eq0.01 ] - [ eq0.04a ] ) .    in the explicit formulas we use the notation @xmath129",
    "> from the covariant expression for the amplitude one can prove that the form factors are analytic functions of @xmath79 .",
    "this proof is not valid for the lf - time - ordered amplitudes .",
    "one can , however , expand the expressions that one obtains for the different parts of the form factor in terms of @xmath130 and determine the @xmath130-dependence at small values of @xmath79 .",
    "it turns out that the results depend on the kinematics : it matters in which reference frame one does the calculations .",
    "we use the fromulas for the momenta given in table  [ tab2 ] and expand the trace and the energy denominators in powers of @xmath130 . from this expansion the analyticity properties of the amplitudes follow .",
    "we have numerically verified that a blow - up of figs .",
    "[ fig0.5]-[fig0.8 ] for small @xmath79 illustrates the analyticity properties of the amplitudes discussed in this appendix .",
    "the three different reference frames are discussed consecutively .",
    "we discuss the valence part of the plus - current in detail ; the other lf form factors can be treated in a similar way .",
    "first we expand the momenta . @xmath131",
    "the trace consists of a piece that is independent of @xmath130 and a piece that consists of two parts , one that is proportional to @xmath132 and a part proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "the denominator @xmath120 has a similar behaviour , but @xmath121 is independent of @xmath130 .",
    "the other cases , nonvalence plus - current , valence and nonvalence minus - current , show the same pattern .",
    "there are pieces independent of @xmath130 , parts with the @xmath130-dependence @xmath137 and ones proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "as the pieces proportional to @xmath138 vanish upon integration , all the components of the form factor show a behaviour similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq0.08 ] ) .",
    "so , only for @xmath95 do we find that the lf time - ordered amplitudes calculated in the target - rest frame are analytic in @xmath79 .",
    "in the case of the breit frame we can follow the same line as in the case of the target - rest frame .",
    "the only difference is that now no terms of the form @xmath132 appear .",
    "as those terms give no contribution to first order in @xmath130 anyway , this does not alter the result : also in the breit frame the components of the form factor have the same small-@xmath130 behaviour as in eq .",
    "( [ eq0.08 ] ) .      in the drell - yan - west frame",
    "there is no angle dependence .",
    "however , there is a term linear in @xmath130 .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath139 .",
    "of course , this term also vanishes upon integration over @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , in the drell - yan - west frame we find no term linearly dependent on @xmath130 , so the amplitudes are analytic in @xmath79 .",
    "the zero mode is defined as the contribution to the nonvalence amplitude that survives the limit @xmath140 .",
    "it is easy to see that only the minus - current can have a zero - mode part , because the integral defining @xmath78 has an integrand that remains finite when @xmath141 goes to 0 .",
    "however , the integrand defining @xmath80 diverges when the limit @xmath140 is taken . in order to determine the limit",
    ", one may expand the integrand in powers of @xmath141 .",
    "as @xmath141 is taken to be zero in the drell - yan - west frame , the analysis can not be done in that frame , but it can most easily be carried out in the breit frame .    the algebra being straightforward but tedious , we shall not give the details .",
    "rather we quote the final result . if we consider the smeared case , the most divergent part of the integrand for @xmath80 has the behaviour @xmath142 . as the integration over @xmath143 ranges from @xmath144 to @xmath145 , we can scale the integration variable as in eq .",
    "( [ eq0.05 ] ) and obtain an integral over @xmath48 from 0 to 1 .",
    "the jacobian being @xmath141 , it cancels one factor @xmath141 in the denominator , so we only need to show that the leading term vanishes to prove that the zero - mode contribution is finite .    upon carrying out the algebra",
    "we find the following result .",
    "the leading part is proportional to @xmath146 this part of the integrand does not vanish , because @xmath147 . however , if we take @xmath148 and @xmath149 , being the mass of the struck quark , and as @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 differ only by a constant vector , this function vanishes after integration over @xmath48 from 0 to 1 and @xmath152 over the whole of @xmath153 .",
    "so we see that the coefficient of the contribution proportional to @xmath154 vanishes .",
    "the remaining part , the piece that survives the limit @xmath140 , is the zero mode contribution . in the breit frame as well as the target - rest frame it is well - defined and finite .",
