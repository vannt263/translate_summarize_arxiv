    "in the last few years , nuclear reactions involving weakly bound nuclei became a subject of interest due to the observation of flux enhancement for processes like nucleon transfer and breakup . through the study of these processes @xcite , it is possible to obtain information about nuclear structure , such as single - particle states and nuclear cluster structure , as well as information about the influence of continuum states in the nuclear reaction dynamics @xcite . additionally , the investigation on how these properties change from the stability line to regions far from the stability valley can also be addressed .",
    "in this context , the elastic scattering measurement and coupled channel analysis @xcite are very important tools to investigate nucleon transfer and breakup , as they appear as competing mechanisms in the reproduction of the measured angular distributions .    in this work , elastic scattering cross section measurements were performed for the @xmath3be+@xmath1c reaction to study anomalies @xcite in the extracted optical parameters values and the contribution of inelastic channels , transfer and compound nucleus formation in the elastic scattering process .",

    "the normalization of the real part of the potential shows a decrease as a function of the bombarding energy , and the normalization of the imaginary part of the potential is approximately constant . during the following two steps",
    ", we investigate the importance of the coupling to inelastic and transfer channels respectively , and finally in the fourth step we analyse the compound elastic contribution .",
