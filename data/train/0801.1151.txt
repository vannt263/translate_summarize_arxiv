    "turbulence is a key element of the dynamics of astrophysical fluids , including those of interstellar medium ( ism ) , clusters of galaxies and circumstellar regions .",
    "the realization of the importance of turbulence induces sweeping changes , for instance , in the paradigm of ism .",
    "it became clear , for instance , that turbulence affects substantially star formation , mixing of gas , transfer of heat .",
    "observationally it is known that the ism is turbulent on scales ranging from aus to kpc ( see armstrong et al 1995 , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) , with an embedded magnetic field that influences almost all of its properties .",
    "the issue of quantitative descriptors that can characterize turbulence is not a trivial one ( see discussion in lazarian 1999 and ref . therein ) .",
    "one of the most widely used measures is the turbulence spectrum , which describes the distribution of turbulent fluctuations over scales .",
    "for instance , the famous kolmogorov model of incompressible turbulence predicts that the difference in velocities at different points in turbulent fluid increases on average with the separation between points as a cubic root of the separation , i.e. @xmath0 . in terms of direction - averaged energy spectrum",
    "this gives the famous kolmogorov scaling @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a _",
    "3d _ energy spectrum defined as the fourier transform of the correlation function of velocity fluctuations @xmath3 .",
    "note that in this paper we use @xmath4 to denote averaging procedure .",
    "quantitative measures of turbulence , in particular , turbulence spectrum , became important recently also due to advances in the theory of mhd turbulence .",
    "as we know , astrophysical fluids are magnetized , which makes one believe that the correspondence should exist between astrophysical turbulence and mhd models of the phenomenon ( see vazquez - semadeni et al . 2000 , mac low & klessen 2004 , bellesteros - paredes et al .",
    "2007 , mckee & ostriker 2007 and ref . therein ) .    in fact , without observational testing",
    ", the application of theory of mhd turbulence to astrophysics could always be suspect .",
    "indeed , from the point of view of fluid mechanics astrophysical turbulence is characterized by huge reynolds numbers , @xmath5 , which is the inverse ratio of the eddy turnover time of a parcel of gas to the time required for viscous forces to slow it appreciably .",
    "for @xmath6 we expect gas to be turbulent and this is exactly what we observe in hi ( for hi @xmath7 ) .",
    "in fact , very high astrophysical @xmath5 and its magnetic counterpart magnetic reynolds number @xmath8 ( that can be as high as @xmath9 ) present a big problem for numerical simulations that can not possibly get even close to the astrophysically - motivated numbers .",
    "the currently available 3d simulations can have @xmath5 and @xmath8 up to @xmath10 . both scale as the size of the box to the first power , while the computational effort increases as the fourth power ( 3 coordinates + time ) , so the brute force approach can not begin to resolve the controversies related , for example , to ism turbulence .",
    "we expect that observational studies of turbulence velocity spectra will provide important insights into ism physics . even in the case of",
    "much more simple oceanic ( essentially incompressible ) turbulence , studies of spectra allowed to identify meaningful energy injection scales . in interstellar , intra - cluster medium , in addition to that , we expect to see variations of the spectral index arising from the variations of the degree of compressibility , magnetization , interaction of different interstellar phases etc .",
    "how to get the turbulence spectra from observations is a problem of a long standing . while density fluctuations are readily available through both interstellar scincillations and studies of column density maps , the more coveted velocity spectra have been difficult to obtain reliably until very recently .",
    "turbulence is associated with fluctuating velocities that cause fluctuations in the doppler shifts of emission and absorption lines .",
    "observations provide integrals of either emissivities or opacities , both proportional to the local densities , at each velocity along the line of sight .",
    "it is far from trivial to determine the properties of the underlying turbulence from the observed spectral line .",
    "centroids of velocity ( munch 1958 ) have been an accepted way of studying turbulence , although it was not clear to when and to what extend the measure really represents the velocity .",
    "recent studies ( lazarian & esquivel 2003 , henceforth le03 , esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et al 2006 , esquivel et al .",
    "2007 ) have showed that the centroids are not a good measure for supersonic turbulence , which means that while the results obtained for hii regions ( odell & castaneda 1987 ) are probably ok , those for molecular clouds are unreliable .",
    "an important progress in analytical description of the relation between the spectra of turbulent velocities and the observable spectra of fluctuations of spectral intensity was obtained in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 , henceforth lp00 ) .",
    "this description paved way to two new techniques , which were later termed velocity channel analysis ( vca ) and velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) .",
    "the techniques provide different ways of treating observational data in position - position - velocity ( ppv ) data cubes . while vca is based on the analysis of channel maps , which are the velocity slices of ppv cubes , the vcs analyses fluctuations along the velocity direction . if the slices have been used earlier for turbulence studies , although the relation between the spectrum of intensity fluctuations in the channel maps and the underlying turbulence spectrum was unknown , the analysis of the fluctuations along the velocity coordinate was initiated by the advent of the vcs theory .    with the vca and the vcs one can relate both observations and simulations to _ turbulence theory_. for instance , the aforementioned turbulence indexes are very informative",
    ", e.g. velocity indexes steeper than the kolmogorov value of @xmath11 are likely to reflect formation of shocks , while shallower indexes may reflect scale - dependent suppression of cascading ( see beresnyak & lazarian 2006 and ref . therein ) . by associating the variations of the index with different regions of ism , e.g. with high or low star formation",
    ", one can get an important insight in the fundamental properties of ism turbulence , its origin , evolution and dissipation .",
    "the absorption of the emitted radiation was a concern of the observational studies of turbulence from the very start of the work in the field ( see discussion in munch 1999 ) .",
    "a quantitative study of the effects of the absorption was performed for the vca in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2004 , henceforth lp04 ) and for the vcs in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2006 , henceforth lp06 ) . in lp06",
    "it was stressed that absorption lines themselves can be used to study turbulence .",
    "indeed , the vcs is a unique technique that does not require a spatial coverage to study fluctuations .",
    "therefore individual point sources sampling turbulent absorbing medium can be used to get the underlying turbulent spectra .",
    "however , lp06 discusses only the linear regime of absorption , i.e. when the absorption lines are not saturated .",
    "this substantially limits the applicability of the technique .",
    "for instance , for many optical and uv absorption lines , e.g. mg ii , sii , siii the measured spectra show saturation .",
    "this means that a part of the wealth of the unique data obtained e.g. by hst and other instruments can not be handled with the lp06 technique .",
    "the goal of this paper is to improve this situation .",
    "in particular , in what follows , we develop a theoretical description that allows to relate the fluctuations of the absorption line profiles and the underlying velocity spectra in the saturated regime .",
    "below , in  2 we describe the setting of the problem we address , while our main derivations are in  3 .",
    "the discussion of the new technique of turbulence study is provided in  4 , while the summary is in  5 .",
    "while in our earlier publications ( lp00 , lp04 , lp06 ) concentrated on emission line , in particular radio emission lines , e.g. hi and co , absorption lines present the researchers with well defined advantages .",
    "for instance , they allow to test turbulence with a pencil beam , suffer less from uncertainties in path length .",
    "in fact , studies of absorption features in the spectra of stars have proven useful in outlining the gross features of gas kinematics in milky way .",
    "recent advances in sensitivity and spectral resolution of spectrographs allow studies of turbulent motions .    among the available techniques , vcs is the leading candidate to be used with absorption lines .",
    "indeed , it is only with extended sources that the either centroid or vca studies are possible . at the same time , vcs makes use not of the spatial , but frequency resolution .",
    "thus , potentially , turbulence studies are possible if absorption along a single line is available . in reality",
    ", information along a few lines of sight , as it shown in fig  1 is required to improve the statistical accuracy of the measured spectrum . using the simulated data sets chepurnov & lazarian ( 2006ab ) experimentally established that the acceptable number of lines ranges from 5 to 10 .    for weak absorption",
    ", the absorption and emission lines can be analyzed in the same way , namely , the way suggested in lp06 .",
    "for this case , the statistics to analyse is the squared fourier transform of the doppler - shifted spectral line , irrespectively of the fact whether this is an emission or an absorption spectral line .",
    "such a `` spectrum of spectrum '' is not applicable for saturated spectral lines , which width is still determined by the doppler broadening .",
    "it is known ( see spitzer 1978 ) that this regime corresponds to the optical depth @xmath12 ranging from 10 to @xmath13 . the present paper will concentrate on this regime larger than @xmath14 the line width is determined by atomic constants and therefore it does not carry information about turbulence . ] .",
    "consider the problem in a more formal way .",
    "intensity of the absorption line at frequency @xmath15 is given as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the optical depth .",
    "in the limit of vanishing intrinsic width of the line @xmath18 , the frequency spread of @xmath19 is determined solely by the doppler shift of the absorption frequency from moving atoms .",
    "the number density of atoms along the line of sight moving at required velocity @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the thermal distribution centered at every point @xmath23 at the local mean velocity that is determined by the sum of turbulent and regular flow at that point .",
    "this is the density in ppv coordinate that we introduced in lp00 , so @xmath24 .",
    "the intrinsic line width is accounted for by the convolution @xmath25 or , in more detail , @xmath26 with intrinsic profile given by the lorenz form @xmath27 , the inner integral gives the shifted voigt profile @xmath28 so we have another representation @xmath29    we clearly see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_h ] ) that the line is affected both by doppler shifts and atomic constants .",
    "the optical depth as a function of frequency contains fluctuating component arising from turbulent motions and associated density inhomogeneities of the absorbers .",
    "statistics of optical depth fluctuations along the line of sight therefore carries information about turbulence in ism .",
    "the optical depth is determined by the density of the absorbers in the ppv space , @xmath30 . in our previous work",
    "we have studied statistical properties of @xmath30 in the context of emission lines , using both structure function and power spectrum formalisms .",
    "absorption lines demonstrate several important differences that warrant separate study .",
    "firstly , our ability to recover the optical depth from the observed intensity @xmath31 depends on the magnitude of the absorption as well as sensitivity of the instrument and the level of measurement noise @xmath32 .    for lines with low optical depth",
    "@xmath33 we can in principle measure the optical depth throughout the whole line . at higher optical depths ,",
    "the central part of the line is saturated below the noise level and the useful information is restricted to the wings of the line .",
    "this is the new regime that is the subject of this paper",
    ".    in this regime the data is available over a window of frequencies limited to velocities high enough so that @xmath34 but not as high as to have lorentz tail define the line .",
    "higher the overall optical depth , narrower are the wings ( following spitzer , at @xmath35 the wings are totally dominated by lorentz factor ) .",
    "we shall denote this window by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the velocity that the window is centered upon ( describing frequency position of the wing ) and @xmath38 is the wing width .",
    "it acts as a mask on the `` underlying '' data @xmath39    secondly , fluctuations in the wings of a line are superimposed on the frequency dependent wing profile . in other words , the statistical properties of the optical depth are inhomogeneous in this frequency range , with frequency dependent statistical mean value . while _ fluctuations _ of the optical depth @xmath40 that have origin in the turbulence can still be assumed to be statistically homogeneous , the mean profile of a wing must be accounted for .",
    "what statistical descriptors one should chose in case of line of sight velocity data given over limited window ?",
    "primary descriptors of a random field , here @xmath41 , are the ensemble average product of the values of the field at separated points  the two point correlation function @xmath42 and , reciprocally , the average square of the amplitudes of its ( fourier ) harmonics decomposition  the power spectrum @xmath43 in practice these quantities are measurable if one can replace ensemble average by averaging over different positions which relies on some homogeneity properties of stochastic process .",
    "we assume that underlying turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "this does not make the optical depth to be statistically homogeneous in the wings of the line , but allows to introduce the fluctuations of @xmath12 on the background of the mean profile @xmath44 , @xmath45 , which are ( lp04 ) @xmath46 homogeneous correlation function depends only on a point separation and amplitudes of distinct fourier harmonics are independent .",
    "the obvious relations are @xmath47    although mathematically the power spectrum is just a fourier transform of the correlation function @xmath48 which of them is best estimated from data depends on the properties of the signal and the data .",
    "the power spectrum carries information which is localized to a particular scale and as such is insensitive to processes that contribute outside the range of scales of interest , in particular to long - range smooth variations . on the other hand , determination of fourier harmonics",
    "is non - local in configuration space and is sensitive to specifics of data sampling  the finite window , discretization , that all lead to aliasing of power from one scales to another .",
    "the issue is severe if the aliased power is large .",
    "conversely , the correlation function is localized in configuration space and can be measured for non - uniformly sampled data . however",
    ", at each separation it contains contribution from all scales and may mix together the physical effects from different scales . in particular , @xmath49 is not even defined for power law",
    "spectra @xmath50 with index @xmath51 ( for one dimensional data ) .. ] this limitation is relieved if one uses the structure function @xmath52 instead , which is well defined for @xmath53",
    ". the structure function can be thought of as regularized version of the correlation function @xmath54 that is related to the power spectrum in the same way as the correlation function , if one excludes the @xmath55 mode .",
    "velocity coordinate spectrum studies of lp06 demonstrated that the expected one dimensional spectrum of ppv density fluctuations along velocity coordinate that arise from turbulent motions is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the index of line - of - sight component of the velocity structure function . for kolmogorov turbulence @xmath58 and for turbulent motions dominated by shocks @xmath59 .",
    "these spectra are steep @xmath60 which makes the direct measurement of the structure functions impractical ( although for @xmath61 the structure function can be defined ) . at the same time , in our present studies we deal with a limited range of data in the wings of the absorption lines , which complicates the direct measurements of the power spectrum .",

    "such `` extremely steep '' spectra emerge naturally , even when the turbulence is close to being kolmogorov .",
    "this was noted in lp06 , where the spectral approach was presented as the correct one to studying turbulence using fluctuations of intensity along v - coordinate .",

    "then the contributions from the scales determined by the window function may interfere in the obtained spectrum at large @xmath64 .",
    "an introduction of an additional more narrow gaussian window function may mitigate the effect , but limits the range of @xmath64 for which turbulence can be studied .",
    "thus , higher order structure functions ( see the subsection above ) , is advantageous for the practical data handling .    in terms of the vca theory , we used mostly spectral description in lp00 , while in lp04 , dealing with absorption , we found advantageous to deal with real rather than fourier space . in doing so",
    ", however , we faced the steepness of the spectrum along the v - coordinate and provided a transition to the fourier description to avoid the problems with the `` extremely steep '' spectrum . naturally , our approach of higher order structure functions is applicable to dealing with the absorption within the vca technique .",
    "in the paper above we have discussed the application of vcs to strong absorption lines .",
    "the following assumption were used .",
    "first of all , considering the radiative transfer we neglected the effects of stimulated emission .",
    "this assumption is well satisfied for optical or uv absorption lines ( see spitzer 1979 ) .",
    "then , we assumed that the radiation is coming from a point source , which is an excellent approximation for the absorption of light of a star or a quasar .",
    "moreover , we disregarded the variations of temperature in the medium",
    ".    within our approach the last assumption may be most questionable .",
    "indeed , it is known that the variations of temperature do affect absorption lines .",
    "nevertheless , our present study , as well as our earlier studies , prove that the effects of the variations of density are limited .",
    "it is easy to see that the temperature variations can be combined together with the density ones to get effective renormalized `` density '' which effects we have already quantified .",
    "our formalism can also be generalized to include a more sophisticated radiative transfer and the spatial extend of the radiation source . in the latter case",
    "we shall have to consider both the case of a narrow and a broad telescope beam , the way it has been done in lp06 .",
    "naturally , the expressions in lp06 for a broad beam observations can be straightforwardly applied to the absorption lines , substituting the optical depth variations instead of intensities .",
    "the advantage of the extended source is that not only vcs , but also vca can be used ( see deshpande et al .",
    "2000 ) . as a disadvantage of an extended source is the steepening of the observed v - coordinate spectrum for studies of unresolved turbulence .",
    "this , for instance , may require employing even higher order structure functions , if one has to deal with windows arising from saturation of the absorption line .    in lp06",
    "we have studied the vcs technique in the presence of absorption and formulated the criterion for the fluctuations of intensity to reliably reflect the fluctuations in turbulent velocities . in this paper , however , we used the logarithms of intensities and showed that this allows turbulence studies beyond the regime , at which fluctuations of intensity would be useful .",
    "the difficulty of such an approach is the uncertainty of the base level of the signal .",
    "taking logarithm is a non - linear operation that may distort the result , if the base level of signal is not accounted for properly .",
    "however , the advantage of the approach that potentially it allows studies of velocity turbulence , when the traditional vca and vcs fail .",
    "further research should clarify the utility of this approach .",
    "the study of turbulence using the modified vcs technique above should be reliable for optical depth @xmath12 up to @xmath13 .",
    "for this range of optical depth , the line width is determined by doppler shifts rather than the atomic constants .",
    "while formally the entire line profile provides information about the turbulence , in reality , the flat saturated part of the profile will contain only noise and will not be useful for any statistical study .",
    "thus , the wings of the lines will contain signal .",
    "as several absorption lines can be available along the same line of sight , this allows to extend the reliability of measurements combining them together .",
    "we believe that piecewise analyses of the wings belonging to different absorption lines is advantageous .",
    "the actual data analysis may employ fitting the data with models , that , apart from the spectral index , specify the turbulence injection scale and velocity dispersion , as this is done in chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "note , that measurements of turbulence in the same volume using different absorption lines can provide complementary information .",
    "formally , if lines with weak absorption , i.e. @xmath148 are available , there is no need for other measurements .",
    "however , in the presence of inevitable noise , the situation may be far from trivial .",
    "naturally , noise of a constant level , e.g. instrumental noise , will affect more weak absorption lines .",
    "the strong absorption lines , in terms of vcs sample turbulence only for sufficiently large @xmath64 .",
    "this limits the range of turbulent scales that can be sampled with the technique .",
    "however , the contrast that is obtained with the strong absorption lines is higher , which provides an opportunity of increasing signal to noise ratio for the range of @xmath64 that is sampled by the absorption lines .",
    "if , however , a single strong absorption line is used , an analogy with a two dish radio interferometer is appropriate .",
    "every dish of the radio interferometer samples spatial frequencies in the range approximately @xmath149 $ ] , where @xmath150 is the operational wavelength , @xmath151 is the diameter of the dish .",
    "in addition , the radio interferometer samples the spatial frequency @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the distance between the dishes . similarly , a strong absorption line provides with the information on turbulent velocity at the largest spatial scale of the emitting objects , as well as the fluctuation corresponding to the scales @xmath154 .    in lp06 we concentrated on obtaining asymptotic regimes for studying turbulence .",
    "at the same time in chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) fitting models of turbulence to the data was attempted . in the latter approach non - power law observed spectra",
    "can be used , which is advantageous for actual data , for which the range of scales in @xmath64 is rather limited .",
    "indeed , for hi with the injection velocities of 10 km / s and the thermal velocities of 1 km / s provides an order of magnitude of effective `` inertial range '' . correcting for thermal velocities one can increase this range by a factor , which depends on the signal to noise ratio of the data .",
    "using heavier species rather than hydrogen one can increase the range by a factor @xmath155 .",
    "this may or may not be enough for observing good asymptotics .",
    "we have seen in [ ] that for absorption lines the introduction of windows determined by the width of the line wings introduces additional distortions of the power spectrum .",
    "however , this is not a problem if , instead of asymptotics , fitting of the model is used .",
    "compared to the models used in chepurnov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) the models for absorption lines should also have to model the window induced by the absorption .",
    "the advantage is , however , that absorption lines provide a pure pencil beam observations .",
    "formally , there exists an extensive list of different tools to study turbulence that predated our studies ( see lazarian 1999 and ref . therein ) .",
    "however , a closer examination shows that this list is not as impressive as it looks .",
    "moreover , our research showed that some techniques may provide confusing , if not erroneous , output , unless theoretical understanding of what they measure is achieved .",
    "for instance , we mentioned in the introduction an example of the erroneous application of velocity centroids to supersonic molecular cloud data .",
    "note , that clumps and shell finding algorithms would find a hierarchy of clumps / shells for synthetic observations obtained with _",
    "incompressible _ simulations .",
    "this calls for a more cautious approach to the interpretation of the results of some of the accepted techniques .    for instance , the use of different wavelets for the analysis of data is frequently treated in the literature as different statistical techniques of turbulence studies ( gill & henriksen 1990 , stutzki et al .",
    "1998 , cambresy 1999 , khalil et al . 2006 ) , which creates an illusion of an excessive wealth of tools and approaches . in reality",
    ", while fourier transforms use harmonics of @xmath156 , wavelets use more sophisticated basis functions , which may be more appropriate for problems at hand . in our studies",
    "we also use wavelets both to analyze the results of computations ( see kowal & lazarian 2006a ) and synthetic maps ( ossenkopf et al . 2006 , esquivel et al .",
    "2007 ) , along with or instead of fourier transforms or correlation functions .",
    "wavelets may reduce the noise arising from inhomogeneity of data , but we found in the situations when correlation functions of centroids that we studied were failing as the mach number was increasing , a popular wavelet ( @xmath38-variance ) was also failing ( cp .",
    "esquivel & lazarian 2005 , ossenkopf et al .",
    "2006 , esquivel et al .",
    "2007 ) .    while in wavelets",
    "the basis functions are fixed , a more sophisticated technique , principal component analysis ( pca ) , chooses basis functions that are , in some sense , the most descriptive . nevertheless , the empirical relations obtained with pca for extracting velocity statistics provide , according to padoan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , an uncertainty of the velocity spectral index of the order @xmath157 ( see also brunt et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is too large for testing most of the turbulence theories .",
    "in addition , while our research in lp00 shows that for density spectra @xmath158 , for @xmath159 both velocity and density fluctuations influence the statistics of ppv cubes , no dependencies of ppv statistics on density have been reported so far in pca studies .",
    "this also may reflect the problem of finding the underlying relations empirically with data cubes of limited resolution .",
    "the latter provides a special kind of shot noise , which is discussed in a number of papers ( lazarian et al .",
    "2001 , esquivel et al .",
    "2003 , chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) .",
    "_ spectral correlation function ( scf ) _",
    "( see rosolowsky et al .",
    "1999 for its original form ) is another way to study turbulence .",
    "further development of the scf technique in padoan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) removed the adjustable parameters from the original expression for the scf and made the technique rather similar to vca in terms of the observational data analysis .",
    "indeed , both scf and vca measure correlations of intensity in ppv `` slices '' ( channel maps with a given velocity window @xmath160 ) , but if scf treats the outcome empirically , the analytical relations in lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) relate the vca measures to the underlying velocity and density statistics .",
    "mathematically , scf contains additional square roots and normalizations compared to the vca expressions .",
    "those make the analytical treatment , which is possible for simpler vca expressions , prohibitive .",
    "one might speculate that , similar to the case of conventional centroids and not normalized centroids introduced in lazarian & esquivel ( 2003 ) , the actual difference between the statistics measured by the vca and scf is not significant .",
    "in fact , we predicted several physically - motivated regimes for vca studies .",
    "for instance , slices are `` thick '' for eddies with velocity ranges less than @xmath160 and `` thin '' otherwise .",
    "vca relates the spectral index of intensity fluctuations within channel maps to the thickness of the velocity channel and to the underlying velocity and density in the emitting turbulent volume . in the vca",
    "these variations of indexes with the thickness of ppv `` slice '' are used to disentangle velocity and density contributions .",
    "we suspect that similar  thick \" and  thin \" slice regimes should be present in the scf analysis of data , but they have not been reported yet . while the vca can be used for all the purposes the scf is used ( e.g. for an empirical comparisons of simulations and observations ) ,",
    "the opposite is not true . in fact , padoan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) stressed that vca eliminates errors inevitable for empirical attempts to calibrate ppv fluctuations in terms of the underlying 3d velocity spectrum .",
    "_ vcs _ is a statistical tool that uses the information of fluctuations along the velocity axis of the ppv . among all the tools that use spectral data , including the vca , it is unique , as it _ does not _ require spatial resolution .",
    "this is why , dealing with the absorption lines , where good spatial coverage is problematic , we employed the vcs . potentially , having many sources sampling the object one can create ppv cubes and also apply the vca technique .",
    "however , this requires very extended data sets , while for the vcs sampling with 5 or 10 sources can be sufficient for obtaining good statistics ( chepurnov & lazarian 2006a ) .",
    "we feel that dealing with the ism turbulence , it is synergetic to combine different approaches .",
    "for the wavelets used their relation with the underlying fourier spectrum is usually well defined .",
    "therefore the formulation of the theory ( presented in this work , as well as , in our earlier papers in terms of the fourier transforms ) in terms of wavelets is straightforward . at the same time",
    ", the analysis of data with the wavelets may be advantageous , especially , in the situations when one has to deal with window functions .",
    "in the paper above we have shown that    * studies of turbulence with absorption lines are possible with the vcs technique if , instead of intensity @xmath161 , one uses the logarithm of the absorbed intensity @xmath162 , which is equivalent to the optical depth @xmath163 .",
    "* in the weak absorption regime , i.e. when the optical depth at the middle of the absorption line is less than unity , the analysis of the @xmath17 coincides with the analysis of intensities of emission for ideal resolution that we discussed in lp06 . * in the intermediate absorption retime , i.e. when the optical depth at the middle of the absorption line is larger than unity , but less than @xmath13 , the wings of the absorption line can be used for the analysis .",
    "the saturated part of the line is expected to be noise dominated . *",
    "the higher the absorption , the less the portion of the spectrum corresponds to the wings available for the analysis . in terms of the mathematical setting",
    "this introduces and additional window in the expressions for the vcs analysis .",
    "however , the contrast of the small scale fluctuations increases with the decrease of the window . * for strong absorption regime ,",
    "the broadening is determined by lorentzian wings of the line and therefore no information on turbulence is available .",
