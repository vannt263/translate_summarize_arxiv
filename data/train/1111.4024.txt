    "traditionally it is believed that the motion of dust grains in the ism arises from radiative force , ambipolar diffusion and hydrodrag ( see draine 2011 ) .",
    "the resulting motion from these processes is sub - alfvnic ( i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath7 is the gas mass density ) , except in special environment conditions ( see purcell 1969 ; roberge et al",

    "recent decade has been marked by substantial progress in understanding of mhd turbulence .",
    "this included generalizing incompressible alfvnic turbulence by goldreich & sridhar ( 1995 ) to realistically compressible media and successful testing of the compressible theory ( lithwick & goldreich 2001 ; cho & lazarian 2002 , 2003 ; kowal & lazarian 2010 ) . in what follows in describing compressible mhd turbulence",
    "we shall be guided by the mode decomposition of mhd turbulence into alfvn , slow and , fast modes presented in cho & lazarian ( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "studies of grain acceleration for magnetized turbulent environments were initiated by lazarian & yan ( 2002 ) who dealt with the acceleration by incompressible alfvnic turbulence .",
    "comprehensive studies of the acceleration in realistically compressible environments were performed in yan & lazarian ( 2003 , hereafter yl03 ) and yan , lazarian & draine ( 2004 , hereafter yld04 ) .",
    "those studies identified gyroresonant interactions of grains with fast mhd modes as a new powerful mechanism of grain acceleration .",
    "recently , yan ( 2009 ) considered betatron acceleration and came to the conclusion that for most environments the betatron acceleration is subdominant to the gyroresonance acceleration for sub - alfvnic grains .",
    "the application of grain velocities predicted by gyroresonance for modeling dust extinction curve provided good correspondences between observations and theoretical predictions ( hirashita & yan 2009 ) indicating that the turbulence is indeed the main driving force behind grain acceleration .",
    "the gyroresonance acceleration due to compressible mhd turbulence ( yl03;yld04 ) was studied using quasi - linear theory ( qlt , jokipii 1966 ; schlickeiser & miller 1998 ) .",

    "transit - time damping ( ttd ) or transit - time acceleration , arises from resonant interactions of particles with the compressive component of magnetic fluctuations ( i.e. , the component parallel to the mean magnetic field @xmath11 ) .",
    "when the grain moves together with the wave along @xmath11 , it is subject to magnetic mirror forces @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the grain mass , @xmath23 is the grain velocity component perpendicular to @xmath11 , and @xmath24 is the total magnetic field . in the plasma reference",
    ", the back and forth collisions of the grain with the moving magnetic mirrors increase grain energy because the head - on collisions are more frequent than trailing collisions due to the larger relative velocity between grain and wave ( see fisk 1976 ; schlickeiser & miller 1998 ) .",
    "the ttd acceleration with resonance condition @xmath25 , was disregarded in previous studies on grain acceleration because grains are expected to move slowly along the uniform magnetic field , for which they can not catch up with the propagation of magnetic mirrors along this direction .",
    "although the gyroresonance is found to be able to accelerate large grains to super - alfvnic velocities ( see yl03 ; yld04 ) , which is sufficient to trigger ttd , the resulting grain motion mostly perpendicular to the uniform field @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath26 ) in the qlt regime makes ttd incapable .",
    "due to magnetic fluctuations in the ism , the local magnetic field @xmath24 can be decomposed into a uniform field plus a turbulent component , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "thus , any perturbation @xmath28 will induce the fluctuations of grain guiding center from a regular trajectory along the uniform magnetic field ( see e.g. , shalchi 2005 ) . non - linear theory ( hereafter nlt ) for gyroresonance that takes into account such fluctuations of guiding center was formulated in yan & lazarian ( 2008 , hereafter yl08 ) to describe the propagation of energetic particles , and later it was applied in yan et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter ylp08 ) to study acceleration of energetic particles in solar flares .",
    "the important modification present in the nlt is the broadening of resonance function from a delta function @xmath29 to a gaussian function @xmath30 ( see yl08 ) .",
    "such a broadening of the resonance condition allows grains moving with @xmath31 perpendicular to @xmath11 to have ttd with compressive waves propagating along @xmath11 .",

    ", we are going to take into account the fluctuations of grain guiding center .",
    "in particular , we are going to investigate the efficiency of ttd on grain acceleration in mhd turbulence .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we present briefly the problem of grain charging , important dynamical timescales , and identify the range of grain size in which grain charge fluctuations are important .",

    "charging processes for a dust grain in the ism consist of its sticking collisions with charged particles in plasma ( draine & sutin 1985 ) and photo - emission induced by @xmath32 ev photons ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) . in the former case , the grain acquires charge by capturing electrons and ions from the plasma , while in the latter case the grain looses charge by emitting photoelectrons . after a sufficient time",
    ", these processes result in a statistical equilibrium of ionization , and the grain has a mean charge , denoted by @xmath33 , which is equal to the charge averaged over time .",

    "<S> we study the acceleration of charged grains by magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . </S>",

    "<S> we calculate grain velocities due to gyroresonance by fast mhd modes using the nlt for different phases of the ism , and compare with results obtained using quasi - linear theory ( qlt ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find for the parameters applicable to the typical ism phases that the fluctuations of grain guiding center reduce grain velocities by less than @xmath0 , but they can be important for more special circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that large grains can be accelerated to super - alfvnic velocities through gyroresonance . </S>",
    "<S> for such super - alfvnic grains , we investigate the effect of further acceleration via transit time damping ( ttd ) by fast modes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that due to the broadening of resonance condition in the nlt , the ttd acceleration is not only important for the cosines of grain pitch angle relative to the magnetic field @xmath1 , but also for @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the grain velocity and @xmath4 is the alfvn speed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ttd acceleration is dominant over the gyroresonance for large grains , and can increase substantially grain velocities induced by gyroresonance acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify another stochastic acceleration mechanism arising from low frequency alfvn waves . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the range of applicability of the mechanisms and their implications . </S>"
