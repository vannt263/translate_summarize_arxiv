    "studies of clustering properties of galaxies at high redshifts are essential for understanding galaxy formation and its relationship to structure formation . the most efficient way to select high redshift ( @xmath20 ) galaxies is the lyman break technique .",
    "high redshift galaxies are isolated in a two - color plane using their uv continuum properties , and galaxies selected in this way are called lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "@xcite studied clustering properties of lbgs on the basis of a large sample for bright ( @xmath21 ) lbgs lying around @xmath22 selected by @xmath23 colors .",
    "they found that the spatial distribution of @xmath22 lbgs is strongly biased relative to the expectations for the dark matter in cold dark matter models with a linear bias of 4.5 predicted for an einstein - de sitter cosmology ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in a subsequent paper , @xcite ( @xcite ; gd01 ) found the clustering amplitude of @xmath24 lbgs to depend on their rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity , with fainter galaxies being less strongly clustered .",
    "@xcite measured the correlation length of faint galaxies in the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) over the redshift range @xmath25 , though errors in their measurements are large due to small statistics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the studies on galaxy clustering to @xmath0 lbgs using a large sample of about 1200 lbg candidates identified by the two color ( @xmath26 vs @xmath27 ) selection technique .",
    "this is the largest sample of @xmath0 lbgs in a contiguous area obtained to date , and thus enables detailed studies of clustering properties of galaxies at the highest redshift . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "deep and wide - field @xmath28-,@xmath29-,@xmath30- and @xmath31-band imaging data of a central @xmath32 area in the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey field ( @xmath33,@xmath34[j2000 ] ) were taken with subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; @xcite ) during the commissioning observing runs on november 24 - 27 , 2000 .",
    "the present work is based on the @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 data .",
    "the individual ccd data were reduced and combined using iraf and the mosaic - ccd data reduction software developed by us ( yagi 1998 ) .",
    "the combined images for individual bands were aligned and smoothed with gaussian kernels to match their seeing sizes .",
    "the final images cover a contiguous 618 arcmin@xmath3 area with a psf fwhm of @xmath35 .",
    "the net exposure times of the final images are 177 , 58 , and 45 minutes for @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the limiting magnitudes are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for a 3@xmath18 detection on a @xmath39 diameter aperture . source detection and photometry are performed using sextractor version 2.1.6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath31-band frame is chosen to detect objects , and we limit the object catalog to @xmath40 , in order to provide a reasonable level of photometric completeness .",
    "our catalog contains 42,557 objects with @xmath42 in total . on the basis of expectations from gissel96 ( @xcite ) population synthesis models galaxies : salpeter imf , @xmath43 , and an age of 10 myr for an instantanious burst ( @xcite ) . ] with dust attenuation of @xmath44 assuming @xcite s ( @xcite ) extinction law , we define the photometric selection criteria for galaxies at @xmath41 as @xmath45 we estimate from the models that the expected redshift distribution of galaxies satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbgselection ] ) is @xmath46 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are a total of 1,192 objects which meet the criteria .",
    "figure [ fig : m_sigma ] shows the number counts of the objects , without correction for incompleteness of detections , against @xmath47 ( filled circles ) .",
    "it is found that our counts are consistent with those given in @xcite , who selected @xmath0 lbgs using @xmath48 color , and that the faint end of our counts matches the counts derived from the hdfn . for the following analyses , we define three lbg samples ; ( 1 ) the whole sample containing 1,192 objects , ( 2 ) the sample for bright ( @xmath49 ) objects , and ( 3 ) the sample for faint ( @xmath50 ) objects .",
    "we have estimated the contamination and completeness of our lbg sample by monte carlo simulations , generating artificial galaxies using the hdfn objects for which magnitudes , colors , and photometric redshifts are given in @xcite , and distributing them on our original images ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contamination is defined , for the detected simulated objects , as the ratio of low redshift ( @xmath51 ) objects meeting eq.([eq : lbgselection ] ) , to all objects satisfying eq.([eq : lbgselection ] ) .",
    "the completeness is defined as the ratio of @xmath1 simulated objects passing our detection threshold _ and _ satisfying eq.([eq : lbgselection ] ) , to all ( detected @xmath52 undetected ) @xmath1 simulated objects .",
    "we find from the simulations that the completeness is @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for the whole , bright , and faint samples , respectively .",
    "similarly , the contamination is @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "note that the completeness defined here is a combination of the detection completeness and the completeness of color selection .",
    "our color criteria effectively sample hdfn galaxies at @xmath59 with a selection completeness of 89% .",
    "namely , 89% of @xmath15 galaxies pass eq.([eq : lbgselection ] ) once they are detected .",
    "we adopt for the redshift distribution @xmath60 of lbgs in our sample the one derived from the simulations taking account of the contamination and completeness .",
    "figure [ fig : lbgdistribution ] shows the sky distribution of @xmath0 lbgs in our sample .",
    "we find in this figure somewhat an inhomogeneous distribution of lbgs , especially for bright ( @xmath61 ) ones .",
    "this is not due to the inhomogeneity of detection completeness over the image , because the monte carlo simulations show that differences in detection completeness among small ( @xmath62 ) areas in the image are less than @xmath63 , and that the detection completeness does not correlate with the distribution of lbgs .",
    "we derive the angular two - point correlation function , @xmath64(@xmath65 ) , using the estimator defined by @xcite , @xmath66/rr(\\theta ) , $ ] where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are numbers of galaxy - galaxy , galaxy - random , and random - random pairs normalized by the total number of pairs in each of the three samples .",
    "the random sample is composed of 200,000 sources with the same geometrical constraints of the data sample . the formal error in @xmath64(@xmath65 )",
    "is assigned by @xmath70/rr}$ ] .",
    "the real correlation function @xmath16 is offset by the integral constant ( @xmath71 : groth & peebles 1977 ) ; @xmath72 , where @xmath71 of the whole sample is calculated to be 0.0045 .",
    "the resulting angular correlation function for the whole sample is shown in figure [ fig : resultacorr_all2 ] after the application of @xmath71 .",
    "we fit a power law , @xmath73 , to the data points , and find the slope @xmath74 , which is consistent with those for nearby galaxies , @xmath75 , though the errors in our estimate are large .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath9 for @xmath76 are summarized in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "the two - point angular correlation function is related to the spatial correlation function @xmath77 by an integral equation , the limber transformation ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath78^{-2 }   \\label{eq : limber}\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "the effect of the change in @xmath81 over @xmath82 on @xmath7 is , however , very small . ]",
    "describes the redshift dependence of @xmath83 , @xmath84is the angular diameter distance , @xmath85 ,   $ ] and @xmath86 is a numerical constant @xmath87}{\\gamma(\\gamma/2)}$ ] .",
    "the slope @xmath88 is related by @xmath89 .",
    "the limber transformation requires the redshift distribution @xmath60 of lbgs ( see  [ sec : selection_sample ] ) .",
    "we adopt the one derived from the simulations based on the hdfn galaxies ( see  [ sec : selection_sample ] ) .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath7 are presented in table [ tab : sample ] for three cosmologies , @xmath90,and @xmath91 .",
    "those correlation lengths correspond to projected angular scales of @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "these scales fall just outside of the range where the power - law fitting is excellent ( @xmath94 ) , implying that @xmath7 is reliably measured from the fit .",
    "varying @xmath60 in a reasonable range changes the results only slightly ; for example , a tophat distribution over @xmath59 returns @xmath95 larger values , and adopting a narrower distribution , @xmath96 , decreases @xmath7 by @xmath97 .",
    "the random contaminant objects dilute the amplitudes of angular correlation function , @xmath9 , by a factor up to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the contamination ( see  [ sec : selection_sample ] ) .",
    "the contamination correction increases @xmath7 by about 20% at most .",
    "the effect of field - to - field variations in our sample is probably modest , since our sample probes a large comoving volume , @xmath100 mpc@xmath101 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 cosmology .",
    "observations of other fields and analyses of n - body simulations for structure formation will be useful for evaluation of the effect of field variation .",
    "figure [ fig : zr0_lambda ] shows the observed correlation length @xmath7 ( in comoving units ) of galaxies at @xmath102 in our sample , together with those at various redshifts between @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "two data points at @xmath22 are the measurements by gd01 for bright ( @xmath105 ) lbgs and faint ( @xmath106 ) lbgs .",
    "it is found that the @xmath7 for our whole sample is only slightly smaller than that for gd01 s bright lbgs at @xmath22 ( the difference in the mean brightness in our three samples is less than 1 mag , and the absolute magnitudes probed by our samples correspond roughly to those probed by gd01 s bright sample ) .",
    "this suggests that the clustering amplitude does not change significantly from @xmath22 to 3.8 , with a possible decrease within @xmath107 .",
    "gd01 found strong luminosity dependence of @xmath7 for @xmath22 lbgs as shown in figure [ fig : zr0_lambda ] .",
    "our sample does not contain as faint lbgs as they studied , but we also find possible dependence on luminosity in our sample , with fainter lbgs having a smaller @xmath7 . @xcite obtained a large value @xmath108 mpc for @xmath0 galaxies in the hdfn .",
    "this is the opposite sense since the galaxies in the hdfn are fainter than those in our sample .",
    "however , the number of galaxies they used is only 35 .",
    "the @xmath7 values of lbgs at @xmath109 are about half that of the nearby galaxies .",
    "the dotted and solid lines in figure [ fig : zr0_lambda ] present , respectively , the evolution of @xmath7 for the dark matter predicted by an analytic model and galaxies of @xmath21 predicted by a semi - analytic model for galaxy formation in a cold dark matter universe with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath110 ( @xcite ) . for the reader",
    "s guide , we also show by the dashed line the @xmath7 of the dark matter predicted by linear theory normalized to @xmath111 mpc . the @xmath7 of the observed lbgs at @xmath93 is found to be @xmath112 times larger than that for the dark matter given by baugh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( in practice , baugh et al .",
    "adopted for the dark matter correlation function the analytic model of @xcite . )",
    "note that if one compares predicted correlation lengths for galaxies with observations , predictions should be made based on selection criteria of galaxies which are similar to those adopted in the observations .",
    "if we interpret this as biasing of galaxy distribution , which is expressed as @xmath113 , we obtain a linear bias @xmath114 , which is similar to that found by gd01 for bright @xmath22 lbgs . on the other hand ,",
    "the semi - analytic model predicts much stronger clustering for galaxies ( similar predictions are made by , eg , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted value at @xmath93 is twice as large as observed in this study .",
    "further discussion requires a detailed comparison of galaxy properties , including selection criteria , between their simulated galaxies and the lbgs in our sample .    in figure",
    "[ fig : resultacorr_all2 ] , we find an excess of @xmath16 at small scales ( @xmath17 ) , over 3 @xmath18 significance levels , relative to the best fit power law .",
    "this may be caused from various effects , for example , galaxy - galaxy mergers , two galaxies within a common dark matter halo , and/or field variance .",
    "if we interpret this as galaxy - galaxy mergers of those @xmath1 lbgs , which are classified as bright lbgs with @xmath115 ( @xcite ) , we calculate , following @xcite , the fraction of galaxies undergoing mergers as @xmath116 from the observed and expected numbers of galaxy pairs with a separation of @xmath117 ( projected physical separation corresponds to 7.5 to 20 @xmath11kpc at @xmath93 ) , where the expected number is calculated from an integration over @xmath117 of the best fit power law derived for the data at @xmath118 .",
    "this @xmath119 value is significantly smaller than those for intermediate - redshift ( @xmath120 ) galaxies whose @xmath119 at @xmath121 20 @xmath11kpc is @xmath122 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this may imply that merger rates for massive galaxies are lower at @xmath0 than at present , if we assume that bright lbgs are massive .",
    "however , @xmath31-band magnitudes ( rest - frame uv for @xmath0lbgs ) are sensitive to on - going star - formation activities , and those luminosities reflect intensity of current star - formation . observing those lbgs in near - ir bands and estimating their mass are needed to address this issue .",
