    "understanding the nature of large - scale structure in the universe is a key component of the field of cosmology and is vital to studies of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the clustering of galaxies reflects the distribution of primordial mass fluctuations present in the early universe and their evolution with time and also probes the complex physics which governs the creation of galaxies in their host dark matter potential wells .    since the first redshift surveys , the two - point correlation function , , has been used as a measure of the strength of galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "is relatively straightforward to calculate from pair counts of galaxies , and it has a simple physical interpretation as the excess probability of finding a galaxy at a separation @xmath18 from another randomly - chosen galaxy above that for an unclustered distribution @xcite .",
    "locally ,  follows a power - law , @xmath19 , on scales @xmath20  with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the scale - length of clustering , , is the separation at which the probability of finding another galaxy is twice the random probability .",
    "locally  is measured to be @xmath22   for optically - selected galaxies but depends strongly on galaxy morphology , color , type and luminosity @xcite .",
    "the spatial clustering of galaxies need not trace the underlying distribution of dark matter .",
    "this was first discussed by @xcite in an attempt to reconcile the different clustering scale lengths of field galaxies and rich clusters , which can not both be unbiased tracers of mass .",
    "the galaxy bias , @xmath23 , is a measure of the clustering in the galaxy population relative to the clustering in the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "it can be defined as the square root of the ratio of the two - point correlation function of the galaxies relative to the dark matter : @xmath24 , either as a function of @xmath18 or defined at a specific scale ( see section 5.1 ) .",
    "observations of galaxy clustering have shown that the galaxy bias can be a function of morphology , type , color , luminosity , scale and redshift .",
    "using galaxy morphologies , @xcite find that early - type galaxies in the stromlo - apm redshift survey are much more strongly clustered than late - type galaxies .",
    "their early - type sample has a larger correlation length , , and a steeper slope than late - type galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite show using data from the southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs2 , da costa et al . 1998 ) that in the absence of rich clusters early - type galaxies have a relative bias of only @xmath25 compared with late - type galaxies . in their sample ,",
    "red galaxies with @xmath26 are significantly more clustered than blue galaxies , with a relative bias of @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite also studied galaxy clustering as a function of color , using data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al . 2000 ) early data release , and find that red galaxies ( @xmath28 ) have a larger correlation length , , a steeper correlation function , and a larger pairwise velocity dispersion than blue galaxies .",
    "they also find a strong dependence of clustering strength on luminosity for magnitudes ranging from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "galaxy clustering for different spectral types in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colless et al .",
    "2001 ) is reported by @xcite ; absorption - line galaxies are shown to have a relative bias @xmath31 times that of emission - line galaxies on scales @xmath32 , declining to unity on larger scales .",
    "absorption - line galaxies have a steeper correlation slope and a larger pairwise velocity dispersion .",
    "all of these results indicate that red , absorption - line , early - type galaxies are found predominantly in the more massive virialized groups and clusters in which the random velocities are large .",
    "@xcite report that the correlation length of optically - selected galaxies in the 2dfgrs depends weakly on luminosity for galaxies fainter than @xmath33 , the typical luminosity of a galaxy , but rises steeply with luminosity for brighter galaxies , with the most luminous galaxies being three times more clustered than @xmath33 galaxies .",
    "these results from local @xmath34 surveys indicate that the strength of galaxy clustering is quite sensitive to different galaxy properties .",
    "a critical test of both cosmological and galaxy evolution models is the redshift - dependence of galaxy clustering .",
    "the evolution of the _ dark matter _ two - point correlation function , @xmath35 , can be calculated readily and is strongly dependent on cosmology . in high - density models",
    "the clustering strength grows rapidly , while models show a more gradual evolution ( e.g. , jenkins et al .",
    "1998 , ma 1999 ) . however , the evolution of the _ galaxy _ two - point correlation function , @xmath36 , depends on the evolution of both the underlying dark matter distribution and the galaxy bias , which is expected to increase with redshift .",
    "applying semi - analytic modelling of galaxy formation and evolution to dark matter simulations , @xcite present  models with  @xmath37   for the galaxy distribution at @xmath38 compared to  @xmath39   locally .",
    "they predict a galaxy bias of @xmath40 at @xmath38 for galaxies with @xmath41 log @xmath42 but also find that the galaxy bias can be a strong function of luminosity , star - formation rate , galaxy type , and sample selection .",
    "@xcite , who also apply semi - analytic modelling to  dark matter simulations , predict a bias of @xmath43 at @xmath38 for galaxies with @xmath44 log @xmath42 .",
    "they also predict a similar morphology - density relation at @xmath38 to that seen locally .",
    "previous redshift surveys which have attempted to probe intermediate redshifts from @xmath45 have been hampered by small volumes and the resulting severe cosmic variance .",

    "@xcite compare results from several surveys which have measured the correlation length  in the range @xmath45 and illustrate well the uncertainties in and discrepancies between these results . for an open cdm cosmology , the estimates of the comoving correlation length vary from @xmath52   at @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , the cfrs survey found a much smaller correlation length at @xmath54 than the other surveys , which generally are consistent with weak evolution between @xmath38 and @xmath55 .",
    "a significantly larger survey was undertaken by cnoc2 @xcite , who obtained redshifts for @xmath56  galaxies over 1.44 degrees@xmath47 .",
    "most relevant for our purposes may be @xcite , who present clustering results for a deep @xmath57 sample of @xmath48 galaxies covering a total of 42.5 arcmin@xmath47 in 5 fields ; they quote a correlation length of  @xmath58   for a  cosmology , implying that their galaxy sample is an unbiased tracer of the mass at @xmath10 .",
    "however , many of these surveys cover very small fields and are likely to underestimate the true clustering .",
    "there is a well - known systematic bias towards underestimation of  in volumes which are small enough that all galaxies are part of a single large - scale structure and in which the large - scale modes can not be sampled .",
    "furthermore , cosmic variance will dominate any measure of clustering in volumes which are too small to be representative samples of the universe @xcite .    here",
    "we present early results on galaxy clustering in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite , an @xmath59band selected survey which was designed to study the universe at @xmath10 with a volume and sampling density comparable to local surveys .",
    "our intent in this paper is to provide an initial measure of the galaxy clustering in our survey at using the first season of data and to investigate the dependence of the clustering on galaxy properties , splitting the sample by color , spectral type , and luminosity . to constrain galaxy evolution models , we measure the galaxy bias for the sample as a whole and the relative bias between subsamples",
    "this is the first of several planned papers on galaxy clustering within the deep2 survey , and here we focus strictly on analysis of spatial correlations .",
    "discussion of redshift - space distortions will appear in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "in the data from the first season of observations we measured 5042 redshifts with @xmath60 in three fields with a total area of 0.72 degrees@xmath47 .",
    "the most complete field currently covers 0.32 degrees@xmath47 and includes 2219 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 , which we use as the primary data sample in this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe the survey , provide details of the observations , data reduction , and the data sample used here . section 3 outlines the methods used in this paper , while section 4 presents our results , both for the survey sample as a whole and for subsamples based on galaxy redshift , color , spectral type , and luminosity . in section 5",
    "we discuss galaxy bias and the relative biases between our subsamples , and we conclude in section 6 .",
    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey is a three - year project using the deimos spectrograph @xcite on the 10-m keck ii telescope to survey optical galaxies at @xmath10 in a comoving volume of approximately 6@xmath6110@xmath62 @xmath63 mpc@xmath64 .",
    "the completed survey will cover 3.5 degrees@xmath47 of the sky over four widely separated fields to limit the impact of cosmic variance .",
    "the `` 1-hour - survey '' ( 1hs ) portion of the deep2 project will use @xmath65  hr exposure times to measure redshifts for @xmath66 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath67 to a limiting magnitude of @xmath1 ( all magnitudes in this paper are in the ab system ; oke & gunn 1983 ) .",

    "this simple color - cut was designed to select galaxies at @xmath73 ( details are given in newman et al .",
    "2004 ) and has proven effective in doing so . as discussed in @xcite this color - cut results in a sample with @xmath7490% of the objects at @xmath73 , missing only @xmath745% of the @xmath73 galaxies .",
    "each of the four deep2 1hs fields corresponds to a volume of comoving dimensions @xmath75   in a  model at a redshift of @xmath38 . to convert measured redshifts to comoving distances along the line of sight we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "three of the four deep2 fields were observed with a total of 68 custom - made slitmasks .",
    "each mask has on the order of @xmath79 slitlets , with a median separation in the spatial direction between targeted galaxies of @xmath80 , and a minimum of 3 . due to the high source density of objects , we are able to obtain spectra for @xmath81 of our targets .",
    "three 20-minute exposures were taken on the deimos spectrograph with a 1200 line mm@xmath82 grating for each slitmask , covering a spectral range of @xmath83   at an effective resolution @xmath84 .",
    "the multiple exposures allow us to robustly reject cosmic rays from the data .",
    "many of the slitlets in each mask are tilted to align with the major axis of the target galaxy to enable internal kinematic studies , and as a result we do not dither the telescope between exposures .",
    "the data were reduced using a sophisticated idl pipeline developed at uc - berkeley , adapted from spectroscopic reduction programs developed for the sdss @xcite . to find the redshift of each galaxy ,",
    "a @xmath85-minimization is used , where the code finds minima in @xmath85 between the observed spectrum and two templates ; one is an artificial emission - line spectrum convolved with a broadening function to mimic a 1@xmath86 slit and 60  internal dispersion .",
    "the other template is a high signal - to - noise ratio absorption - dominated spectrum which is the average of many thousands of sdss galaxies covering a rest wavelength range of 2700 - 9000 @xcite .",
    "the five most - likely redshifts are saved and used in a final stage where the galaxy redshift is confirmed by human interaction .",
    "our overall redshift success rate is @xmath8770% and displays only minor variation with color and magnitude ( @xmath88% ) , with the exception of the bluest galaxies ( @xmath89 ) for which our redshift success rate is @xmath90% .",
    "these galaxies represent @xmath91% of our targeted sample and account for @xmath92% of our redshift failures .    the @xmath933727   [ oii ] doublet redshifts out of our spectral range at @xmath94 , and it is believed that all of our bluest ( @xmath89 ) targeted galaxies for which we do not measure a redshift lie beyond this range .",
    "these galaxies have similar colors and source densities as the population at @xmath95 currently studied by c. steidel and collaborators ( private communication ) . if these galaxies were in our observable redshift window , it is almost certain that we would have measured a redshift , given that these blue galaxies must have recent star - formation and therefore strong emission lines .",
    "although the instrumental resolution and photon statistics of our data would suggest that we could achieve a redshift precision of @xmath96  in the rest frame of each galaxy , we find using galaxies observed twice on overlapping slitmasks that differences in the position or alignment of a galaxy within a slit and internal kinematics within a galaxy lead to an effective velocity uncertainty of @xmath97 .      here",
    "we present results from only the most complete field , centered at 02 hr 30 min + 00 deg , for which we have observed 32 slitmasks covering @xmath98 degrees by @xmath99 degrees on the sky .",
    "we use data only from masks which have a redshift success rate of 60% and higher in order to avoid systematic effects which may bias our results .",
    "figures [ spatial ] and [ windowf ] show the spatial distribution of galaxies on the plane of the sky and the window function for this field .",
    "the observed slitmasks overlap each other in two horizontal rows on the sky .",
    "six of the masks have not as yet been observed in this pointing , leading to regions with lower completeness .",
    "while we measure redshifts as high as @xmath100 , for this paper we include only galaxies with @xmath101 , a range in which our selection function is currently well defined .",
    "our sample in this field and range contains 2219 galaxies , with a median redshift of @xmath102 . at this median redshift",

    "the flux limit of our sample results in the slow decrease of the observed objects at higher redshifts ; smaller - scale variations are due to galaxy clustering .    in order to compute galaxy correlation statistics",
    ", we must understand our selection function @xmath107 , defined as the relative probability at each redshift that an object will be observed in our sample .",
    "in general , the selection function can depend on redshift , color , magnitude , and other properties of the galaxy population and survey selection .",
    "ideally one would compute @xmath107 from the luminosity function of galaxies in the survey .",
    "for this initial study we estimate @xmath107 by smoothing the observed redshift histogram of all the galaxies in our sample , taking into account the change in volume with redshift .",
    "we smoothed with a boxcar of width 450  and then used an additional boxcar of width 150   to ensure that there were no residual bumps due to large - scale structure .",
    "the resulting @xmath107 is shown by the solid line in figure [ zhist ] .",
    "also shown in this figure are the normalized selection functions for the emission - line and absorption - line samples discussed later in the paper ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "note that the redshift distribution @xmath107 is determined using galaxies in all three of our observed fields , not only in the field for which we measure , which reduces effects due to cosmic variance .",

    "must first construct a catalog with a random spatial distribution and uniform density of points with the same selection criteria as the data , to serve as an unclustered distribution with which to compare the data . for each data sample",
    "we create a random catalog with initially @xmath111 times as many objects with the same overall sky coverage as the data and uniform redshift coverage .",
    "this is achieved by applying the window function of our data , seen in figure 1 , to the random catalog .",
    "our redshift completeness is not entirely uniform across the survey ; some masks are observed under better conditions than others and therefore yield a higher success rate .",
    "this spatially - varying redshift success completeness is taken into account in the window function .",
    "we also mask the regions of the random catalog where the photometric data had saturated stars and ccd defects .",
    "finally , we apply our selection function , @xmath107 , so that the random catalog has the same overall redshift distribution as the data .",

    "this estimator has been shown to perform as well as the hamilton estimator @xcite but is preferred as it is relatively insensitive to the size of the random catalog and handles edge corrections well @xcite .",

    "cause an elongation in redshift - space maps along the line - of - sight known as `` fingers of god '' . on large scales ,",
    "coherent infall of galaxies into forming structures causes an apparent contraction of structure along the line - of - sight @xcite . while these distortions can be used to uncover information about the underlying matter density and thermal motions of the galaxies , they complicate a measurement of the two - point correlation function in real space .",
    "instead , what is measured is , where @xmath119 is the redshift - space separation between a pair of galaxies . in order to determine the effects of these redshift - space distortions and uncover the real - space clustering properties",
    ", we measure @xmath118 in two dimensions , both perpendicular to and along the line of sight .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath120 and @xmath121 to be the redshift positions of a pair of galaxies , @xmath122 to be the redshift - space separation ( @xmath123 ) , and @xmath124(@xmath125 to be the mean distance to the pair .",
    "we then define the separation between the two galaxies across ( @xmath126 ) and along ( @xmath127 ) the line of sight as @xmath128 @xmath129 in applying the @xcite estimator , we therefore compute pair counts over a two - dimensional grid of separations to estimate . in measuring the galaxy clustering , one sums over counts of galaxy pairs as a function of separation , normalizing by the counts of pairs in the random catalog . while   is not a function of the overall density of galaxies in the sample ,",
    "if the observed density is not uniform throughout the sample then a region with higher density will contribute more to the total counts of galaxy pairs , effectively receiving greater weight in the final calculation .",
    "the magnitude - limit of our survey insures that our selection function , @xmath107 , is not flat , especially at the higher redshift end of our sample , as seen in figure 2 . to counteract this",
    ", one might weight the galaxy pairs by @xmath130 , though this will add significant noise where @xmath107 is low .",
    "what is generally used instead is the @xmath131 weighting method @xcite , which attempts to weight each volume element equally , regardless of redshift , while minimizing the variance on large scales . using this weighting scheme , each galaxy in a pair",
    "is given a weight @xmath132 @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the redshift of the galaxy , @xmath135 is the redshift - space separation between the galaxy and its pair object , @xmath136 , @xmath107 is the selection function of the sample , such that the mean number density of objects in the sample is @xmath137 for a homogeneous distribution , and @xmath131 is the volume integral of .",
    "we limit @xmath138 20 , the maximum @xmath126 separation we measure , in order to not over - weight the larger scales , which would lead to a noisier estimate of .",
    "note that the weighting depends on the integral over , a quantity we want to measure .",
    "ideally one would iterate the process of estimating  and using the measured parameters in the @xmath131 weighting until convergence was reached .",
    "here we use a power - law form of @xmath139 , with initial parameters of   @xmath140   and @xmath141=1.5 .",
    "these power - law values are in rough accordance with  as measured in our full sample . as tests show that the measured",
    "is quite insensitive to the assumed values of   and @xmath141 , we do not iterate this process .",
    "we estimate @xmath116 to be @xmath142 mpc@xmath143 from the observed number density of galaxies in our sample in the redshift range @xmath144 . as with   and @xmath141 , we find that the results are not sensitive to the exact value of @xmath116 used .      while  can be directly calculated from pair counts , it includes redshift - space distortions and is not as easily interpreted as , the real - space correlation function , which measures only the physical clustering of galaxies , independent of any peculiar velocities . to recover  we use a projection of   along the @xmath126 axis .",
    "as redshift - space distortions affect only the line - of - sight component of , integrating over the @xmath127 direction leads to a statistic , which is independent of redshift - space distortions .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the real - space separation along the line of sight .",
    "if  is modelled as a power - law , @xmath2 , then   and @xmath141 can be readily extracted from the projected correlation function , , using an analytic solution to equation [ eqn ] : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the usual gamma function . a power - law fit to will then recover  and @xmath141 for the real - space correlation function , . in practice ,",
    "equation [ eqn ] is not integrated to infinite separations . here",
    "we integrate to @xmath149 , which includes most correlated pairs .",

    "when observing with multi - object slitmasks , the spectra of targets can not be allowed to overlap on the ccd array ; therefore , objects that lie near each other in the direction on the sky that maps to the wavelength direction on the ccd can not be simultaneously observed .",
    "this will necessarily result in under - sampling the regions with the highest density of targets on the plane of the sky . to reduce the impact of this bias ,",
    "adjacent slitmasks are positioned approximately a half - mask width apart , giving each galaxy two chances to appear on a mask ; we also use adaptive tiling of the slitmasks to hold constant the number of targets per mask . in spite of these steps ,",
    "the probability that a target is selected for spectroscopy is diminished by @xmath91% if the distance to its second nearest neighbor is less than 10 arcseconds ( see davis et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "this introduces a predictable systematic bias which leads to underestimating the correlation strength on small scales .",
    "some previous surveys have attempted to quantify and correct for effects of this sort using the projected correlation function , @xmath150 , of the sample selected for spectroscopy relative to the that of the entire photometric sample @xcite .",
    "other surveys have attempted to correct these effects by giving additional weight to observed galaxies which were close to galaxies which were not observed or by restricting the scales on which they measure clustering @xcite .",
    "it is not feasible for us to use measures of @xmath150 , as the line - of - sight distance that we sample is large ( @xmath1511000 ) and the resulting angular correlations projected through this distance are quite small .",
    "in addition , the relation between the decrease in the 2-dimensional angular correlations and the 3-dimensional real - space correlations is not trivial and depends on both the strength of clustering and the redshift distribution of sources .",
    "in order to measure this bias , we have chosen to use mock galaxy catalogs which have similar size , depth , and selection function as our survey and which simulate the real - space clustering present in our data .",
    "we have constructed these mock catalogs from the gif semi - analytic models of galaxy formation of @xcite .",
    "as described in @xcite , we use outputs from several epochs to create six mock catalogs covering the redshift range @xmath152 . to convert the given comoving distance of each object to a redshift we assumed a  cosmology ; we then constructed a flux - limited sample which has a similar source density as our data .",
    "@xcite presents the selection function and clustering properties of these mock catalogs .    to quantify the effect of our slitmask target selection on our ability to measure the clustering of galaxies , we calculate  and  in these mock catalogs , both for the full sample of galaxies and for a subsample that would have been selected to be observed on slitmasks .",
    "the projected correlation function , , of objects selected to be on slitmasks is lower on scales @xmath153  and higher on scales @xmath154  than the full catalog of objects .",
    "we find that  as measured from  is overestimated by 1.5% in the targeted sample relative to the full sample , while @xmath141 is underestimated by 4% .",
    "thus our target selection algorithm has a relatively small effect on estimates of the correlation strength that is well within the expected uncertainties due to cosmic variance .",

    "different symbols show emission - line and absorption - line galaxies , classified by their spectral type as discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "large - scale clustering can be seen , with coherent structures such as walls and filaments of size @xmath155   running across our sample .",

    "first we measure the clustering for the full sample shown in figure [ cone ] . given the large depth of the sample in redshift , we then address whether it is meaningful to find a single measure of the clustering over such an extended redshift range , as there may be significant evolution in the clustering strength within our survey volume . to investigate evolution within the sample",
    ", we would like to measure the clustering in limited redshift ranges within the survey ; given the current sample size , we divide the data into only two redshift subsamples , studying the front half and back half of the survey separately .",

    "the errors quoted on  and @xmath141 are dominated by the cosmic variance present in the current data sample . to test that our mock catalogs are independent enough to fully estimate the effects of cosmic variance , we also measure the variance in new mock catalogs , which are just being developed @xcite .",
    "these new mocks are made from a simulation with a box size of 300  with finely - spaced redshift outputs .",
    "we find that the error on  in the new mocks is 12% , less than the 16% we find in the gif mock catalogs used here .",

    "this correction will significantly overestimate the correlations on small scales , since it assumes that members of all close pairs on the sky are at the same redshift , but it should provide a strong upper limit on the correlation length . using this correction we find an upper limit on  of @xmath177   and on @xmath141 of @xmath178 .      in the above analysis",
    ", we measured the correlation properties of the full sample over the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "this is a wide range over which to measure a single clustering strength , given both possible evolutionary effects in the clustering of galaxies and the changing selection function of our survey , as the luminosity distance and the rest - frame bandpass of our selection criteria change with redshift .",
    "in addition to possibly ` washing out ' evolutionary effects within our survey in measuring a single clustering strength over this redshift range , the changing selection function makes it difficult to interpret these results . in this section",
    "we attempt to quantify the redshift dependence in our clustering measurements .",
    "we begin by estimating the effective redshift of the correlation function we have measured . the calculations of   presented in the previous section used the @xmath131 weighting scheme , which attempts to counteract the selection function of the survey , @xmath107 , and give equal weight to volumes at all redshifts without adding noise .",
    "to calculate the ` effective ' redshift @xmath179 of the pair counts used to calculate , we compute the mean @xmath131-weighted redshift by summing over galaxy pairs : @xmath180 where @xmath181 runs over all galaxies and @xmath182 over all galaxies within a range of separations from @xmath181 , with @xmath183 , where @xmath135 is the redshift - space separation between the pair of galaxies . the weight @xmath184 is given by equation [ j3eqn ] , and as both galaxies in the pair are at essentially the same redshift ( to within @xmath185 or better ) we use @xmath186 instead of @xmath187",

    "for this reason , assuming only one effective redshift for the correlation function of a deep galaxy sample covering a large redshift range can not accurately reflect the true redshift dependence . we do however estimate an approximate averaged value for @xmath179 for the galaxy sample presented here by summing over all pairs of galaxies with @xmath126 or @xmath127 @xmath19420   ( @xmath195  and @xmath196 ) .",

    "it is important to stress that our use of the traditional @xmath131 weighting scheme for minimum variance estimates of   leads to an effective redshift of the pair counts which is a function of the pair separation ; the correlations of close pairs have a considerably lower effective redshift than pairs with large separation .",

    "we estimate the errors using the variance among the mock catalogs over the same redshift range used for the data .",
    "a positive luminosity - dependence in the galaxy clustering would lead to an increase in  measured at larger redshifts , where the effective luminosity is greater .",

    "@xmath131 weighting in measuring and estimate errors using mock catalogs with half the original sample size . in this way we attempt to replicate the error due to cosmic variance , which depends on the survey volume , and sample size .",
    "we found that the error did not increase signficantly when using half the galaxies , which indicates that cosmic variance is the dominant source of error .",
    "we find that the red galaxies have a larger correlation length and stronger `` fingers of god '' .",
    "this trend is not entirely unexpected , as previous data at @xmath217 have shown similar effects @xcite , though the volume which we sample is much larger and therefore less affected by cosmic variance .",
    "the top of figure [ wprpbr ] shows  for each sample ; fits to are given in table [ r0table ] .    while restframe colors are more physically meaningful than observed colors , they are somewhat uncertain as k - corrections can become large at our highest redshifts .",
    "we therefore divide our full data sample into red and blue subsets based on observed @xmath157 color .",
    "there is a clear bimodality in the distribution of @xmath157 colors of deep2 targets , leading to a natural separation at @xmath218 .",
    "however , as there are not enough galaxies with @xmath219 to provide a robust result , we instead divide the full dataset at @xmath220 , which creates subsamples with @xmath37 times as many blue galaxies as red .",

    "absorption - line galaxies have a larger clustering scale length and an increased pairwise velocity dispersion .",
    "since @xmath221 correlates well with color , this result is not unexpected ; the bulk of the early - type galaxies have red colors , though there is a long tail which extends to the median color of the late - type galaxies .",
    "thus the subsamples based on spectral type are not identical to those based on color .",
    "the spectral - type is intimately related to the amount of current star formation in a galaxy , so that we may conclude that actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 are significantly less clustered than galaxies that are passively evolving .",
    "interestingly , the emission - line galaxies show a steeper slope in the correlation function than the absorption - line galaxies , which is not seen at @xmath225 @xcite",

    "in this early paper , using a sample of roughly 7% the size we expect to have in the completed survey , we have restricted ourselves to considering only two subsamples at a time . as a result , in our luminosity subsamples we are mixing populations of red , absorption - line galaxies , which have very different mass - to - light ratios as well as quite different selection functions , with the star - forming galaxies that dominate the population at higher redshifts .",
    "however , the two luminosity subsamples in our current analysis contain comparable ratios of emission - line to absorption - line galaxies , with @xmath228% of the galaxies in the each sample having late - type spectra . in future papers",
    "we will be able to investigate the luminosity - dependence of clustering in the star - forming and absorption - line populations separately .",

    "errors are derived from the standard deviation of  as measured across the mock catalogs .",
    "the evolution of the dark matter clustering can be predicted readily using either n - body simulations or analytic theory .",
    "here we compute @xmath234 from the dark matter simulations of @xcite at the effective redshifts of both our lower-@xmath205 and higher-@xmath205 subsamples .",

    "our results imply that for @xmath239 in a  cosmology the effective bias of galaxies in our sample is @xmath11 , such that the galaxies trace the mass .",
    "this would suggest that there was little or no evolution in the galaxy biasing function from @xmath38 to 0 and could also imply an early epoch of galaxy formation for these galaxies , such that by @xmath10 they have become relatively unbiased .",
    "however , if @xmath244 then the effective galaxy bias in our sample is @xmath13 , which is more consistent with predictions from semi - analytic models @xcite . generally , we find the net bias of galaxies in our sample to be @xmath247 .",
    "the galaxy bias can be a strong function of sample selection .",
    "one explanation for the somewhat low clustering amplitude we find may be the color selection of the survey .",
    "our flux - limited sample in the @xmath15-band translates to bands centered at @xmath93 = 3600   and 3100   at redshifts @xmath2480.8 and 1.1 , respectively .",
    "the flux of a galaxy at these ultraviolet wavelengths is dominated by young stars , and therefore our sample could undercount galaxies which have had no recent star formation , while preferentially selecting galaxies with recent star formation . the deep2 sample selection may be similar to iras - selected low-@xmath205 galaxy samples in that red , old stellar populations are under - represented ( however , our uv - bright sample is probably less dusty than the iras galaxies ) .",
    "iras - selected samples are known to have a diminished correlation amplitude and undercount dense regions in cluster cores ( e.g. moore et al .",
    "we are accumulating @xmath51-band imaging within the deep2 fields , which we can use to study the covariance of @xmath51-selected samples with our @xmath15-selected sample in order to gain a better understanding of the behavior of @xmath249 at @xmath250 .",
    "@xcite find that their @xmath51-selected sample at @xmath251 generally shows stronger clustering than optically - selected samples at the same redshifts , and we expect the same will hold true for our sample .",
    "the deep2 survey volume is sufficiently extended in the redshift direction that we expect to discern evolutionary effects from within our sample .",
    "for example , the look - back time to @xmath252 is 6.9 gyrs in a  cosmology ( for @xmath253 ) , but at @xmath254 the look - back time grows to 8.4 gyrs . as discussed in section 4.2 ,",
    "measuring the clustering strength for the full sample from @xmath0 is not entirely meaningful , as there may be significant evolutionary effects within the sample , and the results are difficult to interpret given the dependence of the effective redshift on scale .",
    "we therefore divide the sample into two redshift ranges and measure the clustering in the foreground and background of our survey .",
    "however , with the data available to date , our results must be considered initial ; we hope to report on a sample @xmath255 times larger in the next few years .",
    "note also that as our sample size increases and we are better able to divide our sample into narrower redshift ranges , the dependence of @xmath179 on scale will become much less important .    the decreased correlations observed in the higher - redshift subset within the deep2 sample might be considered to be the effect of an inherent diminished clustering amplitude for galaxies in the more distant half of the survey .",
    "indeed , the mass correlations are expected to be weaker at earlier times , but we expect galaxy biasing to be stronger , so that the galaxy clustering may not increase with time as the dark matter distribution does . as a complication , at higher redshifts we are sampling intrinsically brighter galaxies due to the flux limit of the survey , and there is a significant dependence of clustering strength on luminosity in our data .",
    "our lower - redshift sample has an effective luminosity of @xmath2565 log @xmath42 , while for the the higher - redshift galaxies the effective luminosity is @xmath2575 log @xmath42 .",
    "as discussed in section 4.2 , this luminosity difference would lead to an increase in  measured for the higher - redshift sample , if there was no intrinsic evolution in the galaxy clustering .",
    "additionally , at higher redshifts our @xmath15-band selection corresponds to even shorter restframe wavelengths , yielding a sample more strongly biased towards star - forming galaxies .",
    "galaxies which form at high - redshift are expected to be highly - biased tracers of the underlying dark matter density field @xcite ; this bias is expected to then decrease with time @xcite .",
    "if galaxies are born as rare peaks of bias @xmath258 in a gaussian noise field with a preserved number density , their bias will decline with epoch according to @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the linear growth of density fluctuations in the interval since the birth of the objects .",
    "this equation shows that if galaxies are highly biased tracers when born , they should become less biased as the universe continues to expand and further structure forms . this has been the usual explanation for the surprisingly large clustering amplitude reported for lyman - break galaxies at @xmath16 .",
    "they have a clustering scale length comparable to optically - selected galaxies in the local universe , but the dark matter should be much less clustered at that epoch , implying a bias of @xmath261 for a  cosmology @xcite .",

    "@xcite find in their survey ( with @xmath292 ) that galaxies with absorption - line spectra show much stronger clustering at small separations , though their absorption - line sample size is small , with 121 galaxies .",
    "@xcite also report that in the redshift interval @xmath293 , galaxies with red colors have a correlation length 2.7 times greater than bluer galaxies with strong [ oii ] emission .",
    "recently , there have been several studies which have found very large clustering strengths for extremely - red objects ( eros , @xmath294 ) at @xmath217 .",
    "using the angular correlation function , @xcite find a correlation length of  @xmath295   for eros at @xmath296 , while @xcite find that the correlation length is  @xmath297 .",
    "these samples are of rare objects which have extreme colors and are quite luminous ; @xcite estimate that their sample is @xmath298 magnitudes brighter than @xmath299 .",
    "we find a correlation length of  @xmath300 for our absorption - line sample , which has an effective magnitude of @xmath301 log@xmath42 .",
    "given the relatively large clustering strength of the absorption - line galaxies in our sample and the luminosity difference between our sample and the ero studies , it is possible that in our absorption - line sample we are seeing a somewhat less extreme population which is related to the eros seen at @xmath217 .",
    "we find that the relative bias between luminosity subsamples is @xmath302 .",
    "these datasets have significantly different selection functions , unlike the previous samples , and the error on the relative bias due to differences in cosmic variance between the two samples results in an additional 8% error , added in quadrature .",
    "this is calculated using numerical experiments utilizing the cosmic variance in redshift bins calculated in @xcite .",
    "the bright sample has a median absolute magnitude of @xmath3035 log @xmath42 , while the faint sample has a median @xmath3045 log @xmath42 .",
    "as noted in section 4.5 , our luminosity subsamples include both star - forming galaxies as well as older , absorption - line galaxies and cover a wide range in redshift ( @xmath216 ) , possibly complicating interpretation of these results",
    ". however , both samples have the same ratio of early - type to late - type spectra .",
    "the deep2 galaxy redshift survey is designed to study the evolution of the universe from the epoch @xmath305 to the present by compiling an unprecedented dataset with the deimos spectrograph . with the final sample",
    "we hope to achieve a statistical precision of large - scale structure studies at @xmath217 that is comparable to previous generations of local surveys such as the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , shectman et al .",
    "as we complete the survey , our team will explore the evolution of the properties of galaxies as well as the evolution of their clustering statistics .    the correlation analysis reported here",
    "is far more robust than earlier studies at @xmath217 because of our greatly increased sample size and survey volume .",
    "we find values of the clustering scale - length ,  @xmath5   at @xmath4 and   @xmath8   at @xmath7 , which are within the wide range of clustering amplitudes reported earlier @xcite .",
    "this implies a value of the galaxy bias for our sample , @xmath11 if @xmath306 today or @xmath13 if @xmath14 today , which is lower than what is predicted by semi - analytic simulations of @xmath10 .",
    "our errors are estimated using mock catalogs and are dominated by sample variance , given the current volume of our dataset .",
    "we find no evidence for significant evolution of  within our sample , though intrinsic evolutionary effects could be masked by luminosity differences in our redshift subsamples .",
    "we see a significantly - increased correlation strength for subsets of galaxies with red colors , early - type spectra , and higher luminosity relative to the overall population , similar to the behavior observed in low - redshift catalogs .",
    "galaxies with little on - going star formation cluster much more strongly than actively star - forming galaxies in our sample .",
    "these clustering results as a function of color , spectral type and luminosity are consistent with the trends seen in the semi - analytic simulations of @xcite at @xmath38 , and indicate that galaxy clustering properties as a function of color , type , and luminosity at @xmath217 are generally not very different from what is seen at @xmath55 .",
    "the overall amplitude of the galaxy clustering observed within the deep2 survey implies that this is not a strongly biased sample of galaxies . for @xmath239 ( defined as the linear @xmath307 at @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the galaxy bias is @xmath11 , while for @xmath244 , the bias of the deep2 galaxies is @xmath13",
    ". this low bias may result from the @xmath15-band selection of the survey , which roughly corresponds to a restframe @xmath308-band selected sample ; the more clustered , old galaxies with red stellar populations are likely to be under - represented as our sample preferentially contains galaxies with recent star - formation activity .",
    "however , the same selection bias applies to lyman - break galaxies studied at @xmath16 , which are seen to be significantly more biased than our sample at @xmath10 .",
    "we are undertaking studies with @xmath51-band data in our fields , which should lead to clarification of these questions .",
    "more precise determinations of the evolution of clustering within our survey and the luminosity - dependence of the galaxy bias at @xmath10 awaits enlarged data samples , on which we will report in due course .",
