    "the alkali atoms , with one electron outside a closed shell core , have an oscillator strength sum , @xmath12 , to be distributed among all optical transitions from the ground state at energies below the threshold for core excitation  @xcite .",
    "most of this oscillator strength is concentrated in the lowest , @xmath13 , resonance transitions , where @xmath14 for li , 3 for na , etc .",
    "the higher resonance transitions , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , are thus usually much weaker than their conterparts in non - alkali atoms , and their natural linewidths are narrower . in some cases this is accompanied by anomalous intensity ratios of the fine - structure doublet lines , a phenomenon first explained by fermi @xcite .",
    "recent experiments in @xmath5li @xcite and @xmath17k @xcite have shown the advantages of laser cooling with higher resonance lines for reducing the temperature and increasing the phase space density of optically trapped alkali atoms .",
    "the narrow linewidths of these transitions reduce the doppler cooling limit compared to that of the lowest resonance line .",
    "two direct tests were made using similar schemes : laser cooling of the gas in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) using the usual @xmath18 d2 transition ( the wavelengths of which are 671  nm for @xmath5li and 767  nm for @xmath17k ) , followed by transfer of the gas into a mot operating at the @xmath19 uv line ( respectively 323  nm and 405  nm ) . in both cases , temperature reductions by a factor of about five and phase - space density increases by at least a factor of ten were observed .    in this paper",
    "we discuss aspects of this cooling scheme as applied to lithium . in order to be able to continue to laser cool on the uv transition",
    "when a dipole optical trap is turned off , the ac stark shifts of the @xmath7 and @xmath20 levels due to trap light have to be nearly the same , resulting in a sufficiently small differential ac stark shift on the cooling transition to allow for efficient and uniform cooling  @xcite",
    ". the ac stark shifts of these states are generally different and may be of different signs , leading to heating . the same problem , i.e. different stark shifts of two states , affects optical frequency standards based on atoms trapped in optical lattices , because it can introduce a significant dependence of the measured frequency of the clock transition upon the lattice wavelength .",
    "the idea of using a trapping laser tuned to a `` magic '' wavelength , @xmath21 , at which the ac stark shift of the clock transition vanishes , was first proposed in refs .",
    "the use of the magic wavelengths is also important in order to trap and control neutral atoms inside high - q cavities in the strong coupling regime with minimum decoherence for quantum computation and communication schemes @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work is to provide the list of precise magic wavelengths for li uv @xmath22 transitions in convenient wavelength regions .",
    "we also provide a list of available magic wavelength for the @xmath23 transitions , calculate dc and ac polarizabilities for several low - lying states , and provide recommended values for a number of relevant electric - dipole transitions .",
    "we present results for both @xmath5li and @xmath6li to illustrate the possibilities for differential light shifts between the two isotopes .",
    "the magic wavelengths for a specific transition are located by calculating the ac polarizabilities of the lower and upper states and finding their crossing points .",
    "magic wavelengths for lowest @xmath24 transitions in alkali - metal atoms from na to cs have been previously calculated in @xcite , using a relativistic linearized coupled - cluster method . the data in ref .",
    "@xcite provided a wide range of magic wavelengths for alkali - metal atoms .",
    "a bichromatic scheme for state - insensitive optical trapping of rb atom was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of rb ,",
    "the magic wavelengths associated with monochromatic trapping were sparse and relatively inconvenient .",
    "the bichromatic approach yielded a number of promising magic wavelength pairs .",
    "we have also carried out calculations of the dc polarizabilities of the @xmath7 , @xmath25 , @xmath9 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 states to compare with available experimental and high - precision theoretical values .",
    "we refer the reader to the recent review @xcite for extensive comparison of various results for li polarizabilities . here , we provide comparison of our results with the most recent calculations carried out using hylleraas basis functions @xcite since this approach is expected to produce the most accurate recommended values .",
    "comparison with the recent coupled - cluster calculation of @xcite and configuration interaction calculations with core polarization ( cicp ) @xcite is also included .",
    "we also provide values for the tune - out wavelengths , @xmath28 , for which the ground - state frequency - dependent polarizability of li atoms vanishes . at these wavelengths , an atom experiences no dipole force and thus is unaffected by the presence of an optical lattice .",
    "these wavelengths were first discussed by leblanc and thywissen @xcite , and have recently been calculated for alkali - metal atoms from li to cs in @xcite .",
    "our present work provides accurate predictions of the tune - out wavelengths @xmath28 for both @xmath5li and @xmath6li and explores the differences between the first tune - out wavelengths for these isotopes in detail .",
    "we start with the discussions of the calculation of electric - dipole matric elements , static and dynamic polarizabilities as well as their uncertainties .",
    "the static values are compared with other theory and experiment in section  [ sec2 ] .",

    ", we summarize points salient to the present work .",
    "the frequency - dependent scalar polarizability , @xmath29 , of an alkali - metal atom in its ground state @xmath30 may be separated into a contribution from the core electrons , @xmath31 , a core modification due to the valence electron , @xmath32 , and a contribution from the valence electron , @xmath33 .",
    "the core polarizability depends weakly on @xmath34 for the frequencies treated here , since core electrons have excitation energies in the far - ultraviolet region of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , we approximate the core polarizability by its dc value as calculated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . the accuracy of the rpa approach has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the core polarizability is corrected for pauli blocking of core - valence excitations by introducing an extra term @xmath32 . for consistency , this is also calculated in rpa . the valence contribution to frequency - dependent scalar @xmath35 and tensor @xmath36 polarizabilities",
    "is evaluated as the sum over intermediate @xmath37 states allowed by the electric - dipole transition rules  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the reduced electric - dipole matrix elements . in these equations , @xmath34 is assumed to be at least several linewidths off resonance with the corresponding transitions .",

    "the total polarizability of the @xmath56 state depends upon its @xmath57 quantum number .",
