    "we refer to the books @xcite for more information about lvy processes and their many applications .",
    "the most general lvy measures for which the results of this paper applies , are lvy measures @xmath15 that can be decomposed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 see section [ sec : asymm_approx ] for statements of results and remarks .",

    "at least it includes all the lvy measures found in finance , see remark [ rem8 ] , and also many singular measures like e.g.  delta - measures .",
    "it is important to note that non - linear equations like do not admit classical solutions in general , and that shock discontinuities can develop even from regular initial conditions .",
    "this is well known for pure conservations laws ( where @xmath25 ) , see e.g.  @xcite . for fractional conservation laws where @xmath14",
    ", it is shown in recent works that solutions are smooth for @xmath26 @xcite . however , when @xmath27 , the fractional diffusion is too weak to prevent shock discontinuities from forming , see @xcite . in some cases",

    "this has to do with the fact that fourier spectral methods support spurious gibbs oscillations , and thus fails to converge strongly toward discontinuous solutions .",
    "it is well known that such methods need to be augmented by some kind of vanishing viscosity in order to achieve convergence .",
    "but the standard vanishing viscosity method is not spectrally accurate . to overcome these problems",

    "there are two parameters involved in this approach , the coefficient of the viscosity term @xmath29 and the size @xmath30 of the viscosity free spectrum .",
    "spectral accuracy and convergence toward the unique , possibly discontinuous , entropy solution , then follows by imposing appropriate conditions on @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "we also like to mention another important feature of the method .",
    "in all cases , it diagonalizes the fractional term and hence reduces dramatically the computational cost induced by this term . in our rather naive implementation for the fractional burgers equation ,",
    "the svv method turned out to be orders of magnitude faster than a discontinuous galerkin approximation of the same equation where the fractional term gives full matrices .    when equation is linear , @xmath32 , or when it is local @xmath25 , there is a vast literature on numerical methods and analysis , some methods and many references can be found e.g.  in @xcite . in the general case however , there is not much work on numerical methods , we only know of the papers @xcite .",
