    "the process of galaxy formation involves the interplay of many non - linear phenomena that span a wide range of length and time - scales . a galaxy like our milky way , for example , forms from a region that initially extends to roughly one comoving mpc , yet its angular momentum is determined by the mass distribution within tens of comoving mpc . star formation ( sf ) , on the other hand , takes place in the densest cores of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , on scales of the order of 0.1 pc .",
    "the challenge in simulations of galaxy formation is to capture this vast dynamic range , while simultaneously accounting for the different physical processes that intervene on relevant scales .",
    "this is usually achieved with ad hoc sub - grid models that attempt to emulate the most important small - scale phenomena . in particular ,",
    "one of the biggest uncertainties in simulations of galaxy formation is the means by which gas is converted into stars ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "the standard approach to this problem , motivated by observations , is to adopt a schmidt - like law @xcite , often coupled to conditions on the local gas properties .",
    "however , there are several issues with this method .",
    "first , its parameters are poorly constrained and are usually fine - tuned to match the observed kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) relation @xcite .",
    "secondly , there is a growing body of evidence that the local star formation rate ( sfr ) correlates more tightly with the observed density of molecular hydrogen than with that of the total gas density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though there is yet no consensus as to whether this reflects a causal relation .",
    "in particular , numerical simulations of isolated molecular clouds suggest that the presence of molecules does not boost the ability of the gas to cool and form stars @xcite .",
    "the tight spatial correlation between h@xmath1 and young stars may then be due to the fact that they are both formed in high density regions where gas is effectively shielded from the interstellar radiation field .    despite the ongoing debate , there are strong motivations for including a treatment of molecular hydrogen in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "observations of h@xmath1 proxies ( such as co luminosity ) , for example , have progressed tremendously over the past decade ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) , underlining the need for robust theoretical templates to aid in the design of observational campaigns and the interpretation of their results .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations constitute a unique tool to test the impact of h@xmath1-regulated sf on the global structure of galaxies , provided their h@xmath1 content can be reliably determined .",
    "tracking h@xmath1 , however , requires solving a challenging network of rate equations which are coupled to a radiative - transfer computation for h@xmath1-dissociating photons .",
    "given that the spatial resolution of current simulations is comparable in size to gmcs , these calculations must be done at the sub - grid level and include a description of gas structure on the unresolved scales ( e.g. a clumping factor for the gas density ) .",
    "recently , several authors have incorporated simple algorithms to track molecular hydrogen in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "for instance , @xcite monitored the h@xmath1 distribution in dwarf - sized galaxies within a fixed dark matter ( dm ) potential and showed that the resulting molecular mass depends strongly on the metallicity of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also feldmann et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) , who followed the evolution of the h@xmath1 content for 100 myr in a cosmologically simulated galaxy at @xmath2 .",
    "these authors showed that it is only possible to form fully shielded molecular clouds when the gas metallicity is high ( i.e. @xmath3 z@xmath4 ) , and argued that h@xmath1-regulated sf can act as an effective feedback mechanism , delaying sf in the low - metallicity progenitors of a galaxy .",
    "the implications of these results for galaxy formation in low - mass haloes were studied further by @xcite , who suggested the possible existence of a large population of low - mass , gas - rich galaxies that never reached the critical column density required for the h@xmath1/hi transition and are thus devoid of stars .",
    "their work , however , was based on an analytic model for h@xmath1 formation that assumes chemical equilibrium between its formation and destruction rates @xcite .",
    "none the less , @xcite showed that this model agrees well with a time - dependent solution to the chemical network provided the local metallicity of the gas is above @xmath5 z@xmath4 , lending support to these conclusions .",
    "@xcite modelled the non - equilibrium abundance of h@xmath1 in a dwarf galaxy that was simulated down to redshift @xmath6 , connecting sf explicitly to the local h@xmath1 content of the gas .",
    "these authors showed that , compared to simulations rooted on the schmidt law , molecule - based sf produces a galaxy which is more gas rich , has bluer stellar populations and a clumpier ism . on the other hand , strong stellar feedback , when included ,",
    "tends to mitigate these differences by regulating the formation and destruction rates of gmcs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new time - dependent sub - grid model for tracking the non - equilibrium abundance of h@xmath1 in cosmological simulations of galaxy assembly .",
    "our approach builds upon the work of @xcite and @xcite by including additional information on the unresolved distribution of gas temperatures and densities .",
    "in particular , our model : ( i ) explicitly accounts for the distribution of sub - grid densities , as determined by observations and numerical simulations of turbulent gmcs ; ( ii ) invokes a gas temperature - density relation that was determined from detailed numerical studies of the ism @xcite ; and ( iii ) consistently takes into account that denser , unresolved clumps have larger optical depths .    as an application",
    ", we employ the model in a high - resolution simulation that follows the formation of a milky way - sized galaxy down to @xmath0 . in order to explore the interplay between sf , h@xmath1 abundance and galactic structure ,",
    "we re - simulate the same volume using different algorithms for computing the density of molecular hydrogen and the local sfr .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mol_hydrogen_formation ] , we introduce our model for tracking the non - equilibrium h@xmath1 abundance and compare it with other commonly adopted prescriptions that have been discussed in the literature . in sections [ sec : code ] and [ sec : analysis ] , we describe our suite of simulations and present our main results .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions and then critically discuss some of our assumptions in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the abundance of molecular hydrogen in the metal - rich ism is mainly regulated by the competition between its formation due to the catalytic action of dust grains and its photo - dissociation via the two - step solomon process . in the ground state ,",
    "h@xmath1 absorbs electromagnetic radiation in two densely packed series of lines ( the lyman band  characterized by photon energies @xmath7 ev or wavelengths @xmath8   and the werner band ",
    "@xmath9 ev , @xmath10  ) .",
    "radiative decay from the excited states leads to dissociation in approximately 15 per cent of the cases .",
    "direct photo - dissociation would require photons with energy @xmath11 ev , but these are principally absorbed by hydrogen atoms as they lie above the hydrogen photo - ionization threshold ( 13.6 ev , 912  )",
    ". as a result , only photons between @xmath12 can photo - dissociate molecular hydrogen .",
    "lyman - werner ( lw ) photons are copiously emitted by ob stars , but intervening h@xmath1 and dust effectively shield the densest regions of the ism .",
    "this results in an h@xmath1 abundance that increases rapidly towards regions in which the medium becomes optically thick to lw radiation .",
    "an exact treatment of these effects is challenging : it requires three - dimensional radiative transfer calculations capable of resolving length and time - scales orders of magnitude shorter than those associated with galaxy evolution . nevertheless , it is possible to follow the formation of molecular complexes in a phenomenological way , using approximate sub - grid treatments of the most crucial physical processes involved .    in this work ,",
    "we use three different mathematical models that attempt to approximate these effects .",
    "the simplest ( kmt - eq ) is fully analytical ; it returns the equilibrium h@xmath1 fraction in terms of quantities that can be determined locally in a simulation @xcite .",
    "the model is based on a spherical molecular complex immersed in an isotropic bath of lw photons .",
    "assuming that the ism is in a two - phase equilibrium between a cold and a warm neutral medium , it allows both the intensity of the radiation field and the resulting h@xmath1 fraction to be expressed in terms of the local gas column density and metallicity @xcite .",
    "the second model ( kmt - uv ) employs the same analytical relation between the equilibrium h@xmath1 fraction and the radiation density in the lw band .",
    "however , in this case , the latter is calculated numerically within the simulations themselves",
    ". this is achieved by propagating photons from stellar particles assuming that the ism is optically thin within a characteristic length scale and optically thick beyond that ( see appendix  [ sec : uv ] for further details ) .",
    "note , however , that the formation of molecular hydrogen on dust grains is a very inefficient process . in the metal poor ism , for example , the h@xmath1 formation",
    "time - scale approaches a hubble time .",
    "this calls into question the appropriateness of the equilibrium - based models , which _ instantaneously _ populate each simulation volume element with a given fraction of h@xmath1 .",
    "this has motivated several authors @xcite to develop more sophisticated algorithms capable of tracking the non - equilibrium h@xmath1 fraction in high - resolution simulations .",
    "inspired by these efforts , we have developed a novel dynamical model ( dyn ) for calculating the abundance of molecular hydrogen .",
    "this model is described in detail in the following subsection .",
    "the evolution of the h@xmath1 number density is described by the following system of equations : @xmath13 - 2 \\ ,",
    "\\dfrac{{\\rm d}n_{\\rm h_2}}{{\\rm d}t } \\nonumber\\ , , \\\\ & \\label{eq_closure_h } n_{\\textsc{hi}\\,}+n_{\\textsc{hii}}+2n_{\\rm h_2 } = n_{\\rm h}\\,\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the number densities of neutral , ionized and molecular hydrogen ; @xmath17 is the electron number density ; @xmath18 is the @xmath19 collisional destruction rate due to interaction with species @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the unshielded interstellar uv - radiation flux in habing units ( see appendix [ sec : uv ] ) ; @xmath22 is the h@xmath1 photo - dissociation rate for @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the photo - ionization rate , the ionization cross - section @xmath25 and the corresponding optical depth @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denotes the planck constant . ] of @xmath30 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the hydrogen recombination and collisional destruction rates ; @xmath33 is the optical depth of dust in the lw bands ( conventionally evaluated at 1000  ) , where @xmath34 is the total hydrogen column density .",
    "this assumes that the dust abundance scales linearly with the gas metallicity and the dust - to - gas mass ratio is equal to the value measured in the milky way ( mw ) , i.e. 10@xmath35 @xmath36z@xmath4 .",
    "the parametrization of the h@xmath1 self - shielding function , @xmath37 ( approximated for the plane parallel case ) and the h@xmath1 formation rate on dust grains , @xmath38 , are given in table [ table : pararameters ] , and adopt a dust temperature @xmath39 k.    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sec : stellar_disc ]            the evolution of the h@xmath1 ( or total gas ) profile in our simulations determines the structure of the stellar disc . in order to better assess the differences between our runs , we study the radial distribution of stars at @xmath0 within the galaxy in bins of stellar age .",
    "we choose the bins so that , in the std run , the stellar mass produced in each is equal to one fifth of the galaxy s total stellar mass at @xmath0 ( corresponding to age bins of [ 3.35,1.80 ] , [ 1.80,1.39 ] , [ 1.39,0.98 ] , [ 0.98,0.48 ] , [ 0.48,0 ] gyr ) .",
    "the results for the std ( left - hand panels ) and dyn ( right - hand panels ) runs are plotted in the top row of figure [ fig : rad_distr_stars ] ( qualitatively similar results are obtained when using the dyn - sne model instead of dyn ) .",
    "one can see that the dyn model shows significant differences in the age distribution of stars , especially at early formation epochs ( represented with darker shades of blue ) and in the innermost @xmath40 kpc .",
    "these regions are populated by younger stars in dyn than in the std case .",
    "for instance , the mean age of the stellar particles located at @xmath41 kpc is 1.1 gyr in the std simulation , but only 0.6 gyr in dyn .",
    "the total stellar mass within 1 kpc from the galaxy centre at @xmath0 is also different .",
    "in fact , we find values of @xmath42 m@xmath4 for the std run and @xmath43 m@xmath4 for the dyn one .",
    "( for all the other models see table [ table : stars_1kpc ] . )    to explain the origin of this difference , we separate the stars that formed in the central galaxy of the most massive progenitor halo ( second row in figure [ fig : rad_distr_stars ] ) from those that formed in other haloes ( third row ) . in the std model ,",
    "nearly 66 per cent of the stars in the first quintile of the age distribution ( @xmath44 ) does not from in the most massive progenitor . on the other hand , in the dyn simulation ,",
    "only 8 per cent of the final stellar mass is created at such early times mostly in the central galaxy of the most massive progenitor ( 41 per cent ) and in other haloes ( 59 per cent ) .",
    "cumulative distribution of the dm ( thin lines ) and stellar mass ( connected points ) of substructures within the virial radius of the most massive halo at @xmath0 for the std ( red ) , dyn ( black ) , dyn - sne ( magenta ) , kmt - uv ( blue ) and kmt - eq ( green ) runs .",
    "the total number of substructures ( with @xmath45 and hosting at least 100 stellar particles ) is indicated in parenthesis . ]",
    "a visual impression can be formed from figure [ fig : snapshot_z_5 ] where we compare the spatial distribution of dm and stars extracted from the two simulations in the region surrounding the most massive progenitor at @xmath46 .    at this redshift ,",
    "in the std run , 99 per cent of the haloes with @xmath47 m@xmath4 ( i.e. above the mass threshold where sf is suppressed by the cosmic reionization of hydrogen ) contain some stars while only 33 per cent do in the dyn simulation .",
    "this striking difference is due to the fact that most low - mass haloes ( with @xmath48 m@xmath4 ) in the dyn model can not efficiently form molecular hydrogen at early times .",
    "in fact , their dust content and central densities are too low to promote efficient h@xmath1 formation , resulting in much lower sfrs .",
    "we find that their characteristic h@xmath1 formation time , @xmath49 , is several orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe .",
    "therefore , many low - mass haloes stay gas rich but dark ( similar conclusions have been reached using the kmt - eq model by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this phenomenon has strong implications for the assembly of the galaxy in our simulations . in the std run",
    ", the main - progenitor galaxy is built up by a sequence of mergers between objects with extended stellar components .",
    "on the other hand , in the dyn simulation , the same mergers provide gas - rich haloes with a few compact stellar distributions .",
    "once a well defined central galaxy is in place , the merger history in the two models is nearly identical .",
    "however , the different rules with which sf and feedback take place produce a clumpier stellar pattern in the dyn model while the std run more often develops grand design spiral arms in between major merging events . off - centre mergers between substructures",
    "produce large clumps in both models ( see figure 8) . in particular , a massive ( @xmath50 m@xmath4 ) gas - rich condensation forms at @xmath51 is the dyn model and orbits within a few kpc from the galactic centre afterwards .",
    "a first encounter between this object and the central stellar clump of the main galaxy takes place at @xmath52 .",
    "this event heats the distribution of stellar orbits in the core of the dyn galaxy and scatters the old stars ( that were previously concentrated in the middle ) over a more extended area ( see the bottom right panel in figure [ fig : rad_distr_stars ] ) .",
    "sf in the central regions of the galaxy is also boosted at this time ( see the right - hand panel in the second row of figure [ fig : rad_distr_stars ] ) . in both models ,",
    "the late history of the galaxy is characterized by a close encounter with a satellite at @xmath53 which mildly distorts the gas and stellar distributions .",
    "finally , we focus our attention on the distribution of satellite galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_function2 ] shows , for all models , the cumulative number of substructures that are found within the virial radius of the main halo as a function of their dm and stellar masses . while the number of dm clumps is virtually identical in all runs , the std model produces a larger number of bright satellites than any other run ( approximately 30 per cent more than in the dyn simulation and 10 to 30 per cent more in the other models ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the suppression of sf in metal - poor , low - mass haloes that we have already discussed above .",
    "we conclude that molecule - regulated sf can act as an effective feedback mechanism that may alleviate the satellite problem of the cdm scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further study will be necessary to determine whether this conclusion also applies to low redshift galaxies .",
    "we have presented a sub - grid model for tracking the non - equilibrium abundance of molecular hydrogen in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "the novelty of the model is that it phenomenologically accounts for the distribution of unresolved sub - grid densities determined from observations and simulations of the turbulent ism . in this sense",
    ", it improves upon previous time - dependent schemes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the h@xmath1 formation rate on dust grains is amplified by a fixed clumping factor .    we have implemented our model in the code in order to run simulations that track the evolution of the h@xmath1 content of a massive galaxy at @xmath0 , and to study the imprint of h@xmath1-regulated sf . the resulting h@xmath1 fractions in different environments spanning a vast range of gas metallicities and interstellar uv fields are consistent with observations of the milky way galaxy , the lmc and the smc .    in order to better understand what determines the properties of a galaxy , we ran a suite of simulations of the same dm halo , each with a different prescription for computing the h@xmath1 distribution . in the runs where h@xmath1 is calculated explicitly ,",
    "sf was regulated by the local h@xmath1 abundance , while , for another ( std ) , we adopted the traditional schmidt law based on the total gas density .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "all simulations produce a galaxy which is in broad agreement with several high - redshift observational data sets . however , the different models for star and h@xmath1 formation result in important differences in the stellar and gas masses of the galaxies ( see table [ table : par_r200 ] ) .",
    "in particular , if sf is molecule - regulated and the h@xmath1 abundances are computed with a detailed treatment of photo - dissociation including a simplified radiative - transfer scheme : 1 .",
    "the galaxy produces less stars and is in better agreement with the observed stellar - to - halo mass relation with respect to the std model ( which , however , can not be ruled out as we did not study the effect of increasing the spatial resolution of the simulations ) .",
    "2 .   the galaxy harbours a larger gas reservoir and its gas fraction better matches observations of high redshift galaxies . 3 .",
    "early sf is inhibited in metal - poor haloes with mass @xmath48 m@xmath4 in which gas and dust densities are too low to trigger efficient conversion of hi  into h@xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the main galaxy assembles by accreting many gas - rich substructures and , consequently , hosts a younger stellar population and harbours a larger cold gas reservoir than in the std case .",
    "also , the number of satellites of the main galaxy at @xmath0 is reduced by 30 per cent at all stellar masses compared with the std simulation .",
    "regardless of the h@xmath1 model : 1 .",
    "the main galaxy in our simulations ( with the exception of the kmt - eq model ) has similar spatial distribution and total mass of molecular hydrogen at @xmath0 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the average metallicity of the gas in its dominant progenitors is already @xmath54 z@xmath4 at @xmath55 . as a result ,",
    "h@xmath1 formation is rapid , mitigating any subtle differences independent of whether stars form from atomic or molecular gas .",
    "the molecular mass in a cell scales linearly with that of the metals ( above a model - dependent threshold density ) .",
    "this is a consequence of assuming that dust traces the metals in the simulations .",
    "if h@xmath1 destruction by sne is substantial , sf is suppressed by nearly 20 per cent at all times relative to an identical model in which this destruction channel is neglected .",
    "contrary to the assumption that gas is fully molecular in high - redshift galaxies ( commonly used to interpret co observations , e.g. @xcite ) , the atomic gas fraction in our simulated galaxy is comparable to the molecular contribution , independent of the h@xmath1 formation model .",
    "6 .   using the std model to form stars , but",
    "` painting on ' h@xmath1 in post - processing using the kmt - uv prescription , gives a reasonable estimate of the total h@xmath1 mass of the galaxy .",
    "however , as already mentioned above , the resulting galaxy contains more stars ( in particular old stars ) than in all of the molecule - regulated schemes .",
    "although our non - equilibrium h@xmath1 model represents a significant improvement over previous methods , many challenges remain .",
    "for instance , we have assumed that the sub - grid density pdf of gmcs can be accurately described by a lognormal distribution .",
    "this is based on several observations of molecular clouds which , in some cases , show high - density tails in star forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several complex physical phenomena like energy injection , turbulence , gravity and external compression influence the density structure of molecular clouds . yet",
    ", numerical studies of the ism have shown that the lognormal model is a good approximation when an isothermal gas flow is supersonically turbulent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "power - law tails in the high - density regime form under the presence of self - gravity ( which generates dense cores and super - critical filaments ) .",
    "non - isothermal turbulence can also increase the occurrence of dense clumps . none the less ,",
    "these uncertainties are likely sub - dominant to those associated with modelling the effects of sna feedback on gmcs , which must be tackled with small - scale simulations of the ism .    in addition",
    ", we have set the dispersion of the lognormal density distribution to be @xmath56 , consistent with a constant clumping factor @xmath57 .",
    "this choice was motivated by theoretical work that relates local density enhancements to the three - dimensional rms mach number , @xmath58 , with values of @xmath59 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the same value for the clumping factor has been adopted in the literature to best match the h@xmath1 content in observations and simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , observations of gmcs have revealed substantial variations in the mach number @xcite . in future implementations",
    ", the realism of our model can be improved by adjusting the clumping factor ( as well as the pdf of the sub - grid density ) in cells with different mean densities and temperatures . from the technical point of view , this is straightforward to do : the difficulty lies in linking the mean properties of a cell to the sub - grid parameters that regulate the density pdf .",
    "one intriguing possibility could be to implement a simplified description of supersonic turbulence along the lines of that proposed by @xcite .",
    "we plan to return to these issues in future work .",
