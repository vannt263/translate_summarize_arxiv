    "traditionally combinatorialists have studied topological objects that are spherical , such as polytopes , or which are homeomorphic to a wedge of spheres , such as those obtained from shellable complexes . in this paper",

    "it is classical that the convex hull of a finite collection of points in euclidean space is a polytope and its boundary is a sphere .",

    "there is no natural analogue of this process to obtain a complex whose geometric realization is a torus .    in this paper",
    "we are taking a zonotopal approach to working with arrangements on the torus .",
    "recall that a zonotope can be defined without the notion of convexity , that is , it is a minkowski sum of line segments .",
    "dually , a central hyperplane arrangement gives rise to a spherical cell complex . by considering an arrangement on the torus , we are able to obtain a subdivision whose geometric realization is indeed the torus .",
    "we will see later in section  [ section_toric ] that this amounts to restricting ourselves to arrangements whose subspaces in the euclidean space @xmath1 have coefficient matrices with rational entries . under the quotient map @xmath2",

    "zaslavsky initiated the modern study of hyperplane arrangements in his fundamental treatise  @xcite .",

    "zaslavsky showed that evaluating the characteristic polynomial of a central hyperplane arrangement at @xmath4 gives the number of regions in the complement of the arrangement .",
    "for central hyperplane arrangements , bayer and sturmfels  @xcite proved the flag @xmath5-vector of the arrangement can be determined from the intersection lattice ; see theorem  [ theorem_bayer_sturmfels ] .",
    "however , their result is stated as a sum of chains in the intersection lattice and hence it is hard to apply .",
    "billera , ehrenborg and readdy improved the bayer  sturmfels result by showing that it is enough to know the flag @xmath5-vector of the intersection lattice to compute the flag @xmath5-vector of a central arrangement .",
    "recall that the @xmath6-index of a regular cell complex is an efficient tool to encode its flag @xmath5-vector without linear redundancies  @xcite .",
    "the billera  ehrenborg  readdy theorem gives an explicit way to compute the @xmath6-index of the arrangement , and hence its flag @xmath5-vector  @xcite .",
    "we generalize zaslavsky s theorem on the number of regions of a hyperplane arrangement to the toric case .",
    "although there is no intersection lattice per se , one works with the intersection poset . from the zaslavsky result",
    "we obtain a toric version of the bayer  sturmfels result for hyperplane arrangements , that is , there is a natural poset map from the face poset to the intersection poset , and furthermore , the cardinality of the inverse image of a chain under this map is described .    as in the case of a central hyperplane arrangement ,",
    "our toric version of the bayer  sturmfels result determines the flag @xmath5-vector of the face poset of a toric arrangement in terms of its intersection poset .",
    "however , this is far from being explicit . using the coalgebraic techniques from  @xcite ,",
    "we are able to determine the flag @xmath5-vector explicitly in terms of the flag @xmath5-vector of the intersection poset . moreover , the answer is given by a @xmath6 type of polynomial .",
    "the flag @xmath5-vector of a regular spherical complex is encoded by the @xmath6-index , a non - commutative polynomial in the variables @xmath7 and  @xmath8 , whereas the @xmath0-dimensional toric analogue is a @xmath6-polynomial plus the @xmath9-polynomial @xmath10 .",
    "zaslavsky also showed that evaluating the characteristic polynomial of an affine arrangement at @xmath11 gives the number of bounded regions in the complement of the arrangement .",
    "thus we return to affine arrangements in euclidean space with the twist that we study the _ unbounded _ regions .",
    "the unbounded regions form a spherical complex . in the case of central arrangements ,",
    "this complex is exactly what was studied previously by billera , ehrenborg and readdy  @xcite . for non - central arrangements ,",
    "we determine the @xmath6-index of this complex in terms of the lattice of unbounded intersections of the arrangement .",
    "interestingly , the techniques for studying toric arrangements and the unbounded complex of non - central arrangements are similar . hence , we present these results in the same paper .",
    "for example , the toric and non - central analogues of the bayer  sturmfels theorem only differ by which zaslavsky invariant is used .",
    "the coalgebraic translations of the two analogues involve exactly the same argument , and the resulting underlying maps @xmath12 ( in the toric case ) and @xmath13 ( in the non - central case ) differ only slightly in their definitions .",
