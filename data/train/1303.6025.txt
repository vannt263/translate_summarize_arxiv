    "in recent years , a number of papers have considered the feedback control of systems whose dynamics are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics rather than classical mechanics ; e.g. , see @xcite . in particular , the papers @xcite consider a framework of quantum systems defined in terms of a triple @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scattering matrix , @xmath2 is a vector of coupling operators and @xmath3 is a hamiltonian operator .",
    "the papers @xcite consider the problem of absolute stability for a quantum system defined in terms of a triple @xmath0 in which the quantum system hamiltonian is decomposed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a known nominal hamiltonian and @xmath6 is a perturbation hamiltonian , which is contained in a specified set of hamiltonians @xmath7 .",
    "in particular the papers @xcite consider the case in which the nominal hamiltonian @xmath5 is a quadratic function of annihilation and creation operators and the coupling operator vector is a linear function of annihilation and creation operators .",
    "this case corresponds to a nominal linear quantum system ; e.g. , see @xcite . the results in @xcite have recently been extended to allow for uncertainties in the coupling operator @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "also , the results of @xcite have been applied to the robust stability analysis of a quantum system which consists of a josephson junction in a resonant cavity @xcite .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath6 is contained in a set of non - quadratic perturbation hamiltonians corresponding to a sector bound on the nonlinearity . in this case",
    ", @xcite obtains a robust stability result in terms of a frequency domain condition .",
    "also , the paper @xcite restricts attention to quadratic perturbation hamiltonians . in this case , which corresponds to linear perturbed quantum systems ,",
    "a frequency domain robust stability condition is also obtained .",
    "an example considered in the paper @xcite involves the robust stability analysis of a quantum system consisting of a linearized optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) .",
    "optical parametric amplifiers are widely used in the field of experimental quantum optics ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , they can be used as optical squeezers which produce squeezed light which has a smaller noise variance in one quadrature than the standard quantum limit .",
    "this is at the expense of a larger noise variance in the other quadrature ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "such an opa can be produced by enclosing a second - order nonlinear optical medium in an optical cavity ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "thus , an opa is an inherently nonlinear quantum system .",
    "however , the paper @xcite only dealt with linear perturbed quantum systems and thus the results of this paper could only be used to analyze the robust stability of a linearized version of the opa .",
    "furthermore the results of @xcite on nonlinear perturbed quantum systems can not be directly applied to the opa system since the results of @xcite only deal with scalar nonlinearities but the nonlinearity in the opa model is dependent on two variables ; e.g. , see @xcite . in this paper",

    "we now investigate whether this function @xmath33 satisfies the conditions ( [ sector4a ] ) and ( [ sector4b ] ) .",
    "first we calculate @xmath142 from this , we can immediately see that the conditions ( [ sector4a ] ) and ( [ sector4b ] ) will not be globally satisfied .    in order to overcome this difficulty , we first note that any physical realization of a @xmath125 optical nonlinearity will not be exactly described by the model ( [ opa ] ) but rather will exhibit some saturation of the nonlinear effect . in order to represent this effect",
    ", we could assume that the true function @xmath143 describing the hamiltonian of the opa is such that the first two non - zero terms in its taylor series expansion ( [ h2nonquad ] ) correspond to the standard @xmath125 hamiltonian defined by ( [ opaf ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we could assume that the true function @xmath33 is such that the conditions ( [ sector4a ] ) and ( [ sector4b ] ) are satisfied for suitable values of the constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . here",
    "the quantity @xmath144 will be proportional to the saturation limit .",
    "an alternative approach to dealing with the issue that the conditions ( [ sector4a ] ) and ( [ sector4b ] ) will not be globally satisfied by the function @xmath33 defined in ( [ opaf ] ) is to assume that these conditions only hold over some `` domain of attraction '' and then only conclude robust asymptotic stability within this domain of attraction .",
    "this approach requires a semi - classical interpretation of the function @xmath33 since formally the operators @xmath127 and @xmath128 are unbounded operators .",
    "however , it leads to results which are consistent with the known physical behavior of an opa in that it can become unstable and oscillate if the magnitudes of the driving fields are too large ; e.g. , see @xcite . in practice",
    ", the true physical situation will combine aspects of both solutions which we have mentioned but we will concentrate on the second approach involving a semi - classical `` domain of attraction '' .    in order to calculate the region on which our theory can be applied , we note that for our opa model , the condition ( [ sector4a ] ) will be satisfied if @xmath145 we now consider the case in which @xmath146 . in this case , the condition ( [ domain_1 ] ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath147 in the case that @xmath148 , the left hand side of ( [ domain_1 ] ) is always negative and the right hand side of ( [ domain_1 ] ) is always positive .",
    "hence in this case , the condition ( [ domain_1 ] ) will always be satisfied .",
    "also , the condition ( [ sector4b ] ) will be satisfied if @xmath149 the conditions ( [ domain_2 ] ) and ( [ domain_3 ] ) define the region to which our theory can be applied in guaranteeing the robust mean square stability of the opa system .",
    "this region is represented diagrammatically in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the constraints ( [ domain_2 ] ) and ( [ domain_3 ] ) can be interpreted as bounds on the average values of the internal cavity fields for which robust mean square stability can be guaranteed ; see also @xcite .    ) and ( [ sector4b ] ) are satisfied . here",

    "width=302 ]    we now investigate the strict bounded real conditions ( [ hurwitz1 ] ) , ( [ hinfbound2 ] ) . for this system , it follows from the definition ( [ hurwitz1 ] ) that the matrix @xmath151 is given by @xmath152\\ ] ] which is hurwitz for all @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the condition ( [ hurwitz1 ] ) is always satisfied .",
    "also , we calculate the transfer function matrix @xmath153 as @xmath154.\\ ] ] it is straightforward to show that this transfer function matrix has an @xmath155 norm of @xmath156 thus , for this system , the condition ( [ hinfbound2 ] ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath157 hence , using theorem [ t4 ] and lemma [ l3 ] , we can conclude that the opa system ( [ opa ] ) is robustly means square stable provided that the condition ( [ gamma_bound ] ) is satisfied and heisenberg evolution of the quantities @xmath158 and @xmath159 are such that the conditions ( [ domain_2 ] ) and ( [ domain_3 ] ) remain satisfied .",
    "note that in most experimental situations , @xmath160 ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath161 if we then equate @xmath162 , we obtain @xmath163 which can be substituted into the right hand side of ( [ domain_2 ] ) to obtain an upper bound on the region for which the conditions ( [ sector4a ] ) and ( [ sector4b ] ) are satisfied .",
    "this region is defined by ( [ domain_3 ] ) and the inequality @xmath164 also , note that the region defined by ( [ domain_2 ] ) and ( [ domain_4 ] ) will only be an upper bound on a domain of attraction for the opa system . to find an actual domain of attraction for this system",
    ", we would need to find an invariant subset contained in the region defined by ( [ domain_2 ] ) and ( [ domain_4 ] ) .",
    "such an invariant set could be chosen to be an ellipsoidal region defined by the quadratic lyapunov function arising from the matrix @xmath97 solving ( [ qmi2 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the robust stability result of @xcite to the case of non - quadratic perturbations to the hamiltonian which depend on multiple parameters .",
    "this led to a robust stability condition of the form of a multi - variable small gain condition .",
