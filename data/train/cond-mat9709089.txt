    "[ sym - lw]b shows the calculated optical absorption for the previous case .",
    "the anticrossing region ( for @xmath77    wells ) manifests as a reinforcement in the spectral lines , caused by the coincidence of the landau energy and the energy separation between the @xmath63 and @xmath71 states .",
    "it can be seen as the @xmath71 state get close to the @xmath63 state and loose probability for wide wells .",
    "previous works only included the coupling between levels , necessary for having the right energy behavior for the excitonic wave - function for thick barriers , and the general belief was that coupling between others levels is of no importance . in our calculation is clear that although this is true for almost all wells and barrier widths , there are regions where another off - diagonal terms must be included , for explaining the anti - crossings that we obtained between higher levels ( see fig .",
    "[ sym - lb]a ) .      when going from the symmetric case towards the asymmetric one , states prohibited by the quantum well symmetry can appear in the optical absorption spectra .",
    "these states have a small oscillator strength , near the symmetric case , which increases when the @xmath0  potential is going far from symmetry .    in asymmetric double quantum wells , the excitonic ground state wave - function is mostly localized in the wider well . for @xmath58 smaller than @xmath59",
    "the ground state binding energy corresponds to an exciton localized in the right well .",
    "as @xmath58 get closer to @xmath59 , the exciton begin to be present in the left well and the binding energy decreases .",
    "when the two wells are of the same width , the exciton is localized in both wells ( symmetric case ) and the binding energy reach a local minima . for @xmath58",
    "bigger than @xmath59 , the exciton exciton is localized in the left well and the binding energy increases .",
    "after this , the binding energy reach a maxima and decreases towards the tridimensional limit of a very thick left well .",

    "[ asym - lw1 ] ) .",
    "the second excitonic state , prohibited and degenerate in energy with the ground state ( for thick barriers ) in the symmetric case , separates from the ground state when the left well width decreases . for a @xmath80     left well",
    ", this state interacts with the third state , producing an anti - crossing . in the anticrossing region , these states lose their identity , transforming into @xmath81 and @xmath82 . from analyzing the energies and wave - functions in our basis states",
    ", we see that this anti - crossing is not originated by a crossing between electron ( or hole ) levels of the right and left wells ( see ref .  ) , as for almost all left well widths of fig .",
    "[ asym - lw1]a , the electron ( hole ) levels @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are already localized in the right well and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) in the left well .",
    "these anti - crossings , are a consequence of the strong interaction between excitonic states , when the levels corresponding to the direct exciton @xmath71 ( @xmath87 ) and indirect exciton @xmath64 ( @xmath88 ) , get close in energy . the different behavior in these energy levels , when one of the wells width is varied , is originated by the different spatial character of excitons localized in only one well ( direct ) and excitons where electron and hole are localized in different wells ( indirect ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ asym - lw1]b , both excitonic states have a large oscillator strength in the anti - crossing region , and because the energy separation is approximately @xmath89 between them , this anti - crossing could be observed experimentally .    in fig .",
    "[ asym - lb - b]a we show the excitonic states for a @xmath80    left well and a @xmath56    right well in a @xmath50 magnetic field , as a function of the barrier width .",
    "it is clear the way the anti - crossing states evolve and get separated in energy as the barrier is decreased .",
    "when these energy levels go far from each other , the probability of being created optically decreases .",
    "this would make difficult to obtain experimentally this anti - crossing , for barriers smaller than @xmath78    . for wider barriers ,",
    "the direct exciton @xmath71 has a lower energy than the indirect exciton @xmath64 , as a consequence of the large binding energy of @xmath71 , relative to @xmath64 .",
    "these different binding energies are a consequence of the large spatial separation of the wave - functions corresponding to @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    these anti - crossings has not be obtained previously .",
    "we think that it is important to carry out an experimental study , of the correlation in the optical absorption spectrum , for the energies of the second and third excitonic states , in the anti - crossing region . also could be interesting , to study the possible relationship of the states @xmath81 and @xmath82 with charged excitons @xcite , because these states involve one particle wave - functions , corresponding to two electrons and one hole states .",
    "increasing the magnetic field in a symmetric or asymmetric double quantum well , produces a shift in the excitonic energy levels towards higher energies and an increase in the binding energy .",
    "the increase in the binding energy is a consequence of two effects : first , the wave - function confinement in the @xmath1 plane produces a stronger interaction in the @xmath43 , as the electron and hole wave - functions penetrates more in the barrier .",
    "second , the binding between electron and hole in the plane increases , because their wave - functions are confined to a smaller region .",
    "the large binding between electron and hole obtained when increasing the applied magnetic field , is similar to a change in the barrier and well width .",
    "this can be used to study these systems in regions of interest , without the need for the growth of many different samples .    in fig .",
    "[ asym - lb - b]b , we show the magnetic field effects for the asymmetric double quantum well , in the anti - crossing region of fig .",
    "[ asym - lb - b]a .",
    "when the magnetic field ranges from @xmath52 to @xmath92 , the energy levels are shifted towards a bigger energy and the binding is stronger .",
    "the behavior for the indirect excitonic levels is similar to decreasing the barrier width in the anti - crossing region .",
    "the direct exciton binding energy also increases , as a consequence of the wave - function localization in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "because the direct exciton has a larger binding energy than the indirect exciton for large magnetic fields , this level goes below the indirect exciton level for strong magnetic fields .",
    "in this work we studied the energies and oscillator strength , for several excitonic @xmath93 levels in a double quantum well , in a magnetic field pointing in the growth direction @xmath0 .",
    "we calculated the excitonic binding energy and optical absorption for type @xmath94 symmetric and asymmetric double quantum wells , as a function of barrier and well ( or wells ) widths .    in our method",
    "we used an orthogonal basis and we do not employed a variational method .",
    "specific calculations for the ground state excitonic binding energy , in symmetric double quantum wells , are in excellent agreement with the work of cen - bajaj@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the dignam - sipe@xcite work , we used basis functions of single particle solutions of the double quantum well , and our method is valid for all barrier width .",
    "to our understanding , this is the first theoretical calculation , in a symmetric and asymmetric double quantum well , that is valid for all barrier widths .",
    "this allow us to study these systems , from the case of a single quantum well ( null barrier ) to the case where both wells get decoupled .",
    "we do not know another theoretical calculation that predict the anti - crossings between excitonic levels , that we obtain as a consequence of including in our method all the coupling between our basis wave - functions .",
