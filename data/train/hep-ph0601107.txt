    "believed to be the main origin of the jet quenching phenomena observed  @xcite in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions at rhic energy @xmath2@xmath3 , parton energy loss via gluon - radiation is expected to depend on the properties ( gluon density and volume ) of the ` medium ' formed in the collision and on the properties ( color charge and mass ) of the ` probe ' parton  @xcite .",
    "hard gluons would lose more energy than hard quarks due to the stronger color coupling with the medium .",
    "in addition , charm and beauty quarks are qualitatively different probes with respect to light partons , since their energy loss is expected to be reduced , as a consequence of a mass - dependent restriction in the phase - space into which gluon radiation can occur  @xcite .",
    "we study quenching effects for heavy quarks by supplementing perturbative qcd calculations of the baseline @xmath4 distributions with in - medium energy loss , included via the bdmps quenching weights .",
    "the quenching weights , computed for light quarks and gluons in  @xcite and for heavy quarks in  @xcite , depend on the transport coefficient @xmath5 , a measure of the medium density , and on the in - medium path length .",
    "these inputs are evaluated on a parton - by - parton level , using a glauber - model based description of the local @xmath5 profile in the transverse direction  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 value is chosen in order to reproduce the light - flavor particles nuclear modification factor @xmath6 measured in central collisions at @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhic ] , left ) : the range favored by the data for the parton - averaged transport coefficient is @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     heavy - quark energy loss is presently studied at rhic using measurements of the nuclear modification factor @xmath10 of ` non - photonic ' ( @xmath11-conversion- and @xmath12-dalitz - subtracted ) single electrons .",
    "the most recent data by phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite , reaching out to 5 and 9  gev , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhic ] ( right ) .",
    "since this is an inclusive measurement , with charm decays dominating at low @xmath4 and beauty decays dominating at high @xmath4 , the comparison with mass - dependent energy loss predictions should rely on a solid and data - validated pp baseline .",
    "such baseline is still lacking at the moment , as we explain in the following .",
    "the state - of - the - art perturbative predictions ( fonll ) , that we use as a baseline , indicate that , in pp collisions , charm decays dominate the electron @xmath4 spectrum up to about 5  gev  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a large perturbative uncertainty on position in @xmath4 of the @xmath13-decay/@xmath14-decay crossing point : depending on the choice of the factorization and renormalization scales this position can vary from 3 to 9  gev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the calculation tends to underpredict the non - photonic electron spectrum measured in pp collisions  @xcite .    for our electron @xmath10 results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rhic ] , right ) , in addition to the uncertainty on the medium density ( curves for @xmath8 , 10 , @xmath9 ) , we also account for the perturbative uncertainty by varying the values of the scales and of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 quark masses ( shaded band associated to the @xmath15 curve )  @xcite .",
    "we find that the nuclear modification factor of single electrons is about 0.2 larger than that of light - flavor hadrons .",
    "thus , electrons are in principle sensitive to the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss . the available data neither allow us to support claims of inconsistency between theory and experiment , nor",
    "do they support yet the expected mass hierarchy .",
    "it is important to note that , in general , the perturbative uncertainty in calculating the partonic baseline spectrum is comparable to the model - intrinsic uncertainty in determining @xmath5 . if future experimental studies at rhic succeeded in disentangling the charm and beauty contributions to single electrons , the sensitivity in the theory - data comparison would be largely improved .",
    "( left ) and @xmath1 ( right ) mesons for the case of realistic heavy - quark masses and for a case study in which the quark mass dependence of parton energy loss is neglected  @xcite , scaledwidth=85.0% ]    heavy quarks will be produced with large cross sections at lhc energy and the experiments will be equipped with detectors optimized for the separation of charm and beauty decay vertices .",
    "thus , it should be possible to carry out a direct comparison of the attenuation of light - flavor hadrons , @xmath0 mesons , and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we calculate the expected nuclear modification factors @xmath10 exploring a conservatively - large range in the medium density for central collisions at @xmath16 : @xmath17 .",
    "we use standard nlo perturbative predictions for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath4-differential cross sections  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lhc ] ( thick lines ) shows our results for the heavy - to - light ratios of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons  @xcite , defined as the ratios of the nuclear modification factors of @xmath18 mesons to that of light - flavor hadrons ( @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 .",
    "we illustrate the effect of the mass by artificially neglecting the mass dependence of parton energy loss ( thin curves ) .",
    "the enhancement above unity that persists in the @xmath21 cases is mainly due to the color - charge dependence of energy loss , since at lhc energy most of the light - flavor hadrons will originate from a gluon parent .",
    "our results indicate that , for @xmath0 mesons , the mass effect is small and limited the region @xmath22 , while for @xmath1 mesons a large enhancement can be expected up to @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the comparison of the high-@xmath4 suppression for @xmath0 mesons and for light - flavor hadrons will test the color - charge dependence ( quark parent vs. gluon parent ) of parton energy loss , while the comparison for @xmath1 mesons and for light - flavor hadrons will test its mass dependence  @xcite ."
