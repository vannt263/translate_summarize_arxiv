    "developing and spreading of information and communication technology ( ict ) computerize our society all over the world .",
    "one can access information more easily than before 1980s , while one sometimes faces to occasions when one has to handle massive information beyond human information processing capacity .    in early 1990s",
    "financial markets started to introduce electronic trading systems due to development of ict .",
    "this brings that information generated in the financial markets almost becomes detectable .",
    "it is even becoming possible to conduct algorithmic trading or automated trading by using real - time financial data .",
    "the foreign exchange market is the largest financial market all over the world .",
    "recently an increasing number of financial institutions are embracing the opportunities and benefits in automated and algorithmic trading systems .",
    "these systems have been successively studied in order to avert risks due to explosion of information and several financial institutions even experimentally or commercially utilize them  @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that more becoming common more trading can be quickly conducted .",
    "moreover they have an advantage to human traders from a viewpoint of fairness , accuracy , speed , and cost - effectiveness .",
    "if they excess critical mass then human traders may not understand what happens in the financial markets .",
    "therefore it is expected to become an important work to construct a system to quantify market states ( states of market participants in financial markets ) automatically since monitoring of financial markets of which speed is predicted to be beyond human information processing capacity is needed . from physical point of view",
    "practical methods should be considered . in order to construct such a system constructive utilization of high frequency financial data",
    "should be sophisticated .    generally speaking massive data contain less information since one can not understand and handle them without computers . in order to understand them some kinds of information extraction techniques",
    "are proposed  @xcite . by application of the random matrix theory to correlation matrices of multi - dimensional time",
    "series some studies showed that market states reveal in both eigenvectors and eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the bone structure consisting of larger eigenvectors is related to clusters of financial markets .",
    "this approach is based on methods to extract network structures of correlation network  @xcite .",
    "in fact correlations among financial commodities are related to market structure but multiple aspects to measure states of financial markets should be discussed .    in this article",
    "we consider alternative method to quantify market states with spectral methods .",
    "moreover the relation between spectral distance and behavioral parameters of agents is discussed through an agent - based model .",
    "recent works show that agent - based models of financial markets are useful to understand price formation mechanism in the financial markets  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this article is constructed as follows . in section [ sec : spectral - distance ] definition of spectral distance for multi - dimensional time series is presented . in section [ sec : representative - quantities ]",
    "quotation rates and quotation frequencies are introduced as representative quantities of financial markets . in section [ sec : empirical - analysis ] the jensen - shannon spectral divergence and the kullback - leibler spectral distance are calculated by using high - frequency financial data of the foreign exchange market . in section [ sec : agent - based model ] in order to check adequateness of proposal methods those spectral distances are calculated by an agent - based model . section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted into concluding remarks .",
    "consider @xmath0-dimensional time series @xmath1 with a sampling period @xmath2 .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath3 is estimated as periodgram estimator with the hanning windowing function with width @xmath4 , @xmath5 the periodgram estimator is calculated as @xmath6 where the nyquist frequency is @xmath7 . by using the normalized power spectrum , which is defined as @xmath8 the spectral entropy is calculated as its shannon entropy ; @xmath9 note that a direct current component is ignored in this definition .",
    "obviously when @xmath3 is a white noise it takes the maximum value since the power spectrum of it is a uniform function .",
    "contrarily when @xmath3 is a sinusoidal function it takes the minimum value since the power spectrum of it is a dirac s @xmath10-function .",
    "in fact the spectral entropy indicates randomness of time series .",
    "high / low @xmath11 means that @xmath3 is unpredictable / predictable .",
    "suppose the situation to predict time series from historical observation .",
    "the mode for a normalized power spectrum is the frequency where the normalized power spectrum has the maximum value : @xmath12 if the spectral entropy is low then sinusoidal signal with @xmath13 is an adequate model to predict the future time series .",
    "contrarily if the spectral entropy is high then sinusoidal signal with @xmath13 is unworkable to predict the future time series .",
    "therefore the spectral entropy is related into predictability of the mode on a frequency domain .    actually according to the maximum entropy principle the best choice for the distribution @xmath14 is the one that maximizes eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectral - entropy ] ) subject to the constraint the normalized condition @xmath15 by using the lagrange multiplier differentiating @xmath16 with respect to @xmath14 and then equating the result to zero one obtains the uniform normalized power spectrum @xmath17 namely the best choice without knowledge is the uniform power spectrum , which means that time series are white noises .    by using the spectral entropy the jensen - shannon spectral distance  @xcite for @xmath0-dimensional time series",
    "is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , one can quantify the similarity among a set of time series .",
    "the jensen - shannon spectral distance measures similarity of randomness among time series . as an alternative spectral distance",
    "the kullback - leibler spectral distance defined as @xmath21 can be considered in analogy with relative entropy between normalized power spectra  @xcite .",
    "what are representative quantities of financial markets ?",
    "since there is circular causality between market participants and a broking system quotations are causes / results for broking systems / market participants , and transactions are results / causes ( see .",

    "quotation frequencies are defined as the number of quotations per unit time , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of ask / bid quotations of the @xmath24-th currency pair from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , and @xmath2 denotes the sampling period .",
