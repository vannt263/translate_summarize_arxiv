    "there has been considerable interest recently in defining and studying @xmath0-analogs of various coefficients in the representation theory of semisimple lie algebras and , more generally , of kac - moody algebras .",
    "an important such @xmath0-analog is the one defined by lusztig @xcite for the dimension of the space of weight @xmath10 in the irreducible representation of a semisimple lie algebra with highest weight @xmath4 .",
    "this @xmath0-analog is usually denoted by @xmath3 , and is known as a kostka - foulkes polynomial .",
    "its importance is highlighted by its occurence in various contexts beside the original definition .",
    "for instance , it was shown to be an affine kazhdan - lusztig polynomial ( and therefore has positive integer coefficients ) , it gives the expansion of a hall - littlewood polynomial in the basis of irreducible characters , it encodes the brylinski - kostant filtration of weight spaces , and is closely related to the so - called energy function in the representation theory of affine algebras @xcite .",
    "other @xmath0-analogs studied recently include the generalization of lusztig s @xmath0-analog to symmetrizable kac - moody algebras @xcite , and various @xmath0-analogs of branching coefficients for semisimple lie algebras ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    in this paper , we define and study a generalization of lusztig s @xmath0-analog of weight multiplicities to the most fundamental lie superalgebras , namely the general linear superalgebras @xmath1 and the orthosymplectic superalgebras @xmath7 .",
    "a substantial interest in lie superalgebras comes from mathematical physicists , due to various physical interpretations . in his fundamental paper ,",
    "kac @xcite classified the simple finite dimensional lie superalgebras that are not lie algebras .",
    "he also gave a formula for the characters of the finite dimensional irreducible representations of these superalgebras which are known as typical . since kac s paper , the investigation centered on character formulas for the atypical representations , and on extending kashiwara s theory of crystals @xcite to lie superalgebras .",
    "our @xmath0-analog of weight multiplicities for the typical representations of lie superalgebras is based on a natural quantization of kac s character formula .",
    "more precisely , it is based on a @xmath0-partition function which , in a certain sense , is defined in precisely the same way as its counterpart for semisimple lie algebras , on which the definition of lusztig s @xmath0-analog is based .",
    "we also define a @xmath0-analog for the irreducible covariant tensor modules via a quantization of a character formula due to berele - regev and sergeev .",
    "the positivity of these @xmath0-analogs is proved by reducing it to that of lusztig s @xmath0-analog .",
    "it is well - known that lusztig s @xmath0-analog for the general linear groups is expressed combinatorially via the lascoux and schtzenberger charge statistic on semistandard young tableaux @xcite .",
    "we derive here a similar statistic on the set of semistandard hook - tableaux introduced in @xcite , and show that it can be used to express the @xmath0-analog associated to an irreducible covariant tensor @xmath1-module .",
    "our @xmath0-analog @xmath3 for the orthosymplectic algebras does not have the positivity property in general .",
    "nevertheless , we prove that the positivity holds in an important special case , which is related to a certain stabilization phenomenon occuring when the dominant weight @xmath10 is sufficiently far from a specific wall of the fundamental chamber . it is interesting to note that the stabilized version of lusztig s @xmath0-analog for the orthogonal and symplectic algebras can be computed via a combinatorial algorithm ; the reason is a connection with the energy function on affine crystals , which is explained in @xcite . in general ,",
    "there is no known combinatorial formula for lusztig s @xmath0-analogs in types @xmath11 ; in particular , there is no generalization of the lascoux - schtzenberger charge .",
    "this suggests that our @xmath0-analogs for the orthosymplectic algebras will also be hard to compute combinatorially",
    ".    it would be interesting to see whether any of the structures related to lusztig s @xmath0-analog ( affine hecke algebras , hall - littlewood polynomials , the brylinski - kostant filtration , the energy function ) could be defined for lie superalgebras . if so , we expect them to be related in the same way to our @xmath0-analog .",
