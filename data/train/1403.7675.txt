    "it is natural to ask : is the same true for ( nonreal ) pre - existing resonances @xmath3 in atoms ( which might arise as shape resonances or due to a broken symmetry ) ? in this paper we discuss and answer this question in a very simple model , namely the friedrichs model .",

    "one might expect that essentially the same methods as used in the case of bound states turning into resonances should be sufficient to treat this problem .",
    "however , our somewhat surprising result is that this is not true : not only do these methods fail , but the expected stability result itself does not hold , at least in the physically most relevant case of pre - existing resonances near the real axis .",
    "this is due to the blow - up of relevant resolvents as @xmath4 for values of the spectral parameter near the pre - existing original resonance ; see @xcite .",
