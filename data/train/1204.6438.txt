    "the goal of this paper is the study of stochastic non - holonomic systems .",
    "this is a natural continuation of the work on stochastic hamiltonian systems pioneered by bismut  @xcite and revitalized , brought up to date , and expanded by lzaro - cam and ortega @xcite who also connected it to symmetries , momentum maps , and reduction .",
    "a non - holonomic system is , essentially , a rigid body together with a set of constraints on the velocities .",
    "a prototypical example is the chaplygin ball ( @xcite ; for a modern treatment see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) ) . here",
    ", the configuration space is the direct product lie group @xmath1 , describing orientation and position of the ball , and the kinetic energy is specified by a left - invariant metric @xmath2 ; there are two ( non - integrable ) velocity constraints so that the ball does not slip , i.e. , the point of contact of the ball and the plane has zero velocity . without constraints ( which is clearly not the case in the problem just presented )",
    ", this would describe the motion of a rigid body in the plane , hence it would be a hamiltonian system .",
    "stochastically perturbed versions of the latter setting ( i.e. , without constraints ) have been considered by lzaro - cam and ortega ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  7.3 ) : let @xmath3 be the kinetic energy hamiltonian of a left invariant metric on the lie group @xmath0 , @xmath4 an orthonormal basis of the lie algebra @xmath5 of @xmath0 , @xmath6 its extension to a left invariant frame on @xmath0 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath9 is the component @xmath10 of the momentum map @xmath11 defined by the lift to @xmath12 of right translation of @xmath0 on itself .",
    "the @xmath13-valued function @xmath14 on @xmath15 is left invariant . following @xcite and assuming that the perturbation is given by white noise , the stochastic rigid body is thus modeled by the stratonovich equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the hamiltonian vector field of the function @xmath18 and @xmath19 is brownian motion in @xmath20 .",
    "a physical system modeled by this equation is that of a rigid body subject to small random impacts .",
    "note that , since @xmath21 is auto - parallel for the levi - civita connection , the equation @xmath22 yields the hamiltonian construction of brownian motion , as in @xcite .    to pass to the nonholonomic setting , we note that the equations of motion of the constrained ( chaplygin ) ball can be encoded in the vector field @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the constraint force projection and is defined in below .",
    "the effect of @xmath24 is to force the dynamics generated by @xmath25 to satisfy the constraints .",
    "thus , the idea of ` the hamiltonian construction of stochastic non - holonomic systems ' is to apply @xmath24 to .",
    "in fact , since @xmath23 is nothing but the non - holonomic vector field ( see section  [ sec:2 ] ) , we will focus on studying the effects of @xmath24 on the second term in equation  .",
    "this yields non - holonomic constraints on the operator which is used to construct brownian motion , thus leading to ` constrained brownian motion ' described by @xmath26 as it stands , this equation has some problems .",
    "it depends very much on the basis @xmath6 that was chosen in the definition of the @xmath9 .",
    "for example , since the no - slip constraints are actually right invariant , one could have chosen a right invariant frame .",
    "but then the hamiltonian description of brownian motion needs a correction term involving the levi - civita connection of @xmath2 .",
    "this approach has been taken in @xcite .",
    "however , the basis dependence implies that the generator of also changes when we pass to a different frame , and there would be many natural choices depending on whether the frame should be left or right invariant , adapted to the constraint distribution , or the direct product structure of @xmath0 , etc .",
    "even if one ignores these issues , it is not clear what to do if the configuration space is not parallelizable .",
    "for all these reasons we transfer the construction to the bundle of orthonormal frames itself .",
    "it is only then that the generator of the resulting ` constrained brownian motion ' is basis independent .",
    "this constrained brownian motion has some interesting features :    * to visualize it , we can think of a microscopic robot ( or ball , snakeboard , etc . )",
    "subject to molecular bombardment .",
    "the robot thus experiences small impacts from all sides ( isotropic in space ) which force it to move around , but it still has to respect the constraints .",
    "* now , it turns out , that the geometry of the constraints determines the probabilistic properties of the perturbed system . indeed ,",
    "if the constraints are integrable , then the robot s net drift will vanish .",
    "however , when the constraints are non - integrable and non - mechanical ( which is the generic case ) the gaussian noise will induce a net drift on the robot . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we quantify this drift in terms of the geometry of the constraint distribution .",
    "_ mechanical constraints _ are given , by definition as level sets of conserved quantities , such as momentum maps .",
    "e.g. , the constraints could be given by the horizontal bundle of the mechanical connection , which is just orthogonal to the vertical bundle in the case of a symmetry group action . * this leads to a dictionary between probabilistic aspects of the perturbed system and classical properties of the original ( deterministic ) non - holonomic system .",
    "see theorem  [ thm : main ] below for a preliminary statement of this dictionary and section  [ sec:4 ] for further details .",
    "since this paper addresses both the geometric mechanics and the stochastic differential equations communities , we shall give the necessary background for all concepts and quote the main results that are used later on .",
    "the paper is self contained .",
    "we briefly present the main results and the structure of the paper .",
    "we start by recalling the necessary facts , concepts , and results of non - holonomic systems and their geometry .",
    "this includes a careful presentation of symmetries , reduction , and conditions for the existence of a ( smooth ) preserved measure .",
    "we will have to rephrase some of the existing results in view of applying them to our stochastic study later on and develop the theory in the direction needed in subsequent sections in the paper .",
    "thus , we will have to give complete proofs not only for some of the known results , due to our reformulation , but we also need to establish new formulas .",
    "for example , the _ global _ formula of the symplectic form on the tangent bundle given in terms of an underlying riemannian metric on configuration space is new , as far as we know . in",
    "we introduce the above mentioned constraint force projection and explain its properties to prepare for section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "we also study chaplygin systems , which are non - holonomic systems with a particularly rich geometric structure , and the symmetry reduction of such systems .",
    "one of the main points of section  [ sec:2 ] is the presentation of a certain one - from @xmath27 which , according to proposition  [ prop : pm ] , characterizes the existence of a ( smooth ) preserved measure for a given chaplygin system .",
    "this result has been previously derived in @xcite but both our proof and our interpretation of the relevant one - form @xmath27 are different .",
    "in fact , our formulation of @xmath27 in is a prerequisite for section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "first , we recall some notions about manifold valued stochastic differential equations and diffusions from @xcite",
    ".    then we study symmetries of stratonovich equations .",
    "we consider a manifold @xmath28 together with a proper action by a lie group @xmath0 and a diffusion @xmath29 generated by a stratonovich operator @xmath30 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 satisfying the equivariance relation . in this setting , the stratonovich operator does not ( in general ) induce a stratonovich operator on the base @xmath33 ; however , the diffusion @xmath29 and its generator @xmath34 are projectable to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , there is an induced diffusion @xmath35 with induced generator @xmath36 on the base space @xmath33 .",
    "see theorem  [ prop : s - equiv ] .",
    "two examples for this procedure of ` equivariant reduction ' are the eells - elworthy - malliavin construction of brownian motion ( cf .",
    "equation  ) on a riemannian manifold and the stochastic calogero - moser systems ( see @xcite ) , as remarked in subsection  [ sec : equiv - red ] .",
    "in particular , we allow for non - free @xmath0-actions on @xmath28 and hence @xmath33 is , in general , not a smooth manifold but a stratified space . thus , we extend the reduction theorem of ( * ? ? ? * theorem  3.1 ) to the case when the stratonovich operator on the total space is not invariant but equivariant with respect to a symmetry group action .",
    "this naturally leads to the introduction , in subsection  [ sec : equiv - diff ] , of certain notions of equivariant diffusions , previously studied in @xcite .",
    "the material of this subsection will also be useful in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in particular , we prove a mean reconstruction equation for diffusions in principal bundles which is analogous to a concept by the same name in mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * theorem  11.8 ) ) and uses that of @xcite .",
    "this section contains the main results of the paper .",
    "we introduce constrained brownian motion as motivated above .",
    "this involves a careful analysis of the underlying geometry",
    ". then we study the generator and symmetry reduction of the resulting diffusion process .",
    "the reduction relies on theorem  [ prop : s - equiv ] .",
    "the surprising fact in this regard , is that there is a very strong interrelation of some probabilistic aspects of constrained brownian motion and certain deterministic properties of the original non - holonomic system .",
    "a first instance of this relation is :    constrained brownian motion is a martingale with respect to the non - holonomic connection on the configuration space .",
    "a second result yields a probabilistic characterization of the existence of a preserved measure which is a very important concept in the theory of non - holonomic systems ( see @xcite ) :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath37 be a @xmath0-chaplygin system such that the base @xmath38 is compact .",
    "let @xmath39 be the non - holonomic diffusion in @xmath40 associated to these data",
    ". then the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath37 has a ( smooth ) preserved measure ; 2 .",
    "@xmath39 is time - reversible ; 3 .",
    "@xmath39 has vanishing entropy production rate .",
    "the compactness assumption on @xmath40 is met in all classical examples such as the chaplygin ball or the two - wheeled robot .",
    "this theorem sums up some of the results of sections  [ sec:4 ] and [ sec : trd ] , where also the relevant notions are introduced .      as examples , we consider the two - wheeled robot and the snakeboard .",
    "the former is @xmath0-chaplygin and does ( in general ) not allow for a preserved measure .",
    "the latter is not a chaplygin system but does fit the general set - up of section  [ sec:4 ] . for both of these examples",
    "we consider also the stochastic perturbation of deterministic trajectory planning .",
    "this emphasizes the way in which the noise couples with the constraints to produce a non - trivial drift vector field ( the emergence of which is at the heart of the geometry of section  [ sec:4 ] ) ; this is in sharp contrast to stochastic hamiltonian systems .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian analogue of non - holonomic reduction is reduction at the @xmath41-level set of the standard cotangent bundle momentum map , which reduces brownian motion to brownian motion in the base with respect to the induced metric .",
    "this is a manifestation of the idea that the amount by which a non - holonomic system differs from a hamiltonian one can be measured by the amount by which the induced diffusion differs from brownian motion  and vice versa .",
    "however , in the non - holonomic setting , the constraints induce a drift giving rise to drifted brownian motion on the base space .",
    "this drift is quantified in section  [ sec:4 ] and we use it to make the perturbed motion follow a given curve _ on average_. we show how the explicit form of the drift allows , in principle , for a simple numerical implementation to solve such a motion planning problem .",
    "it should be noted , though , that we have made no attempt to study stability or convergence properties of the resulting numerical algorithm .",
    "similar problems have been treated , from a different perspective , in the engineering literature ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "we recall some facts about non - holonomic and , specifically , @xmath0-chaplygin systems .",
    "then we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a preserved measure that is suitable for our applications in section  [ sec:4 ] .    a _ non - holonomic system _ is a triple @xmath42 consisting of a @xmath43-dimensional configuration manifold @xmath28 , a constraint distribution @xmath44 which is smooth and of constant rank @xmath45 ( i.e. , it is a vector subbundle of @xmath32 of rank @xmath46 ) , and a smooth lagrangian function @xmath47 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath42 are given by the lagrange - dalembert principle ; see @xcite . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume that @xmath48 is the kinetic energy of a riemannian metric @xmath2 on @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath49 is a vector bundle isomorphism covering the identity on @xmath28 , we shall identify the vector bundles @xmath32 with @xmath50 .",
    "we follow @xcite to give an almost hamiltonian description of the dynamics of @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the tangent bundle projection and @xmath52 the inclusion .",
    "define @xmath53 in standard vector bundle charts of @xmath32 and @xmath54 , we write @xmath55 as @xmath56 and @xmath57 as @xmath58 , respectively . since @xmath59 , it follows that @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "thus @xmath63 is a vector subbundle of @xmath64 of rank @xmath65 .",
    "( if @xmath66 is the horizontal subbundle of a principal connection of some proper and free @xmath0-action on @xmath28 then @xmath63 is the horizontal space of the tangent lifted @xmath0-action on @xmath66 .",

    ". we will prove identity later on , after the proof of proposition [ prop_omega_formula ] .    for reasons that will become clear in section  [ sec:4 ] , we elaborate on .",
    "we use the levi - civita connection @xmath72 on @xmath73 to decompose @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the _ vertical _ and @xmath76 is the _",
    "horizontal subbundle_. recall that a curve @xmath77 in @xmath32 is _ horizontal _ if its covariant derivative @xmath78 vanishes ; here @xmath79 is the parallel transport operator of the levi - civita connection @xmath80 and @xmath81 . alternatively , since @xmath82 , or in coordinates , @xmath83 , the curve @xmath77 is horizontal if and only if in any standard tangent bundle chart @xmath84 a vector @xmath85 is called _ horizontal _ if it is tangent to a horizontal curve .",

    "@xmath86 is the vector subspace formed by all horizontal vectors .",

    "similarly @xmath98 is an isomorphism .",
    "its inverse is the horizontal lift mapping which is often written as a map @xmath99 , @xmath100 . interpreting @xmath101 as a vector bundle over @xmath32 with base the first factor , makes @xmath102 into a vector bundle isomorphism covering the identity on @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath103 be the inverse to the vertical lift mapping @xmath104 defined by @xmath105 , for all @xmath106",

    "let @xmath148 be the kinetic energy hamiltonian on @xmath32 which we regard as the legendre transform of @xmath48 .",
    "then the dynamics of the non - holonomic system @xmath42 are given by the vector field @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath148 .",
    "more generally , for a function @xmath151 we regard @xmath152 as the non - holonomic vector field of @xmath153 .",
    "let @xmath154 denote the fiberwise restriction of @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",

    "it is also assumed that the constraint distribution is the horizontal subbundle of the connection @xmath169 , i.e. , @xmath170 .",
    "thus the system @xmath42 is a non - holonomic system and the dynamics are determined by the lagrange - dalembert equations ; see @xcite .",
    "it is _ not _ assumed that @xmath66 is orthogonal to the vertical space @xmath171 .    since @xmath172 is the horizontal subbundle , it is invariant with respect to the tangent lifted @xmath0-action on @xmath32",
    ". thus we obtain a principal @xmath0-fiber bundle @xmath173 .",

    "this form is the correction that one needs to subtract from the canonical symplectic form in order to give an almost hamiltonian formulation of the reduced non - holonomic system . to define this form , we need three ingredients :    * the _ adjoint bundle _ : let @xmath0 act on @xmath182 by the ( free and proper ) action given by @xmath183 , for all @xmath184 , @xmath121 , @xmath164 , and let @xmath185 be the orbit space .",

    "as stated , this formula does not make sense for general lie groups because the momentum map is @xmath204-valued and the curvature on the base is @xmath186-valued so the pairing makes no sense .",

    "due to the importance of this formula we make a few additional comments .",
    "recall that the momentum map @xmath211 is equivariant with respect to the coadjoint action on @xmath204 .",

    "the curvature of @xmath174 is @xmath218 which is equivariant : @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the action of @xmath221 .",
    "thus the two - form @xmath222 defines a @xmath0-invariant two - form on @xmath172 .",
    "this two - form is , moreover , horizontal : since @xmath218 is a curvature form on @xmath223 it vanishes upon insertion of vertical vectors , whence the same holds also for @xmath224 .",
