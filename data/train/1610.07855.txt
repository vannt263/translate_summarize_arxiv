    "finite - size corrections and scaling for critical lattice systems , initiated more than four decades ago by ferdinand , fisher , and barber @xcite have attracted much attention in intervening decades ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "finite - size effects are of practical interest due to recent progress in fine processing technologies , which has enabled the fabrication of nanoscale materials with novel shapes @xcite .",
    "as soon as one has a finite system one must consider the question of boundary conditions on the outer surfaces or `` walls '' of the system . as is well known , the critical behavior near boundaries normally differs from the bulk behavior .",
    "recently , there has been much progress on understanding conformal boundary conditions in rational conformal field theories .",
    "this has been caused by its relevance in string and brane theory on the one hand , and in various problems of statistical mechanics and condensed matter on the other .",
    "for @xmath12 minimal theories , a complete classification has been given @xcite of the conformal boundary conditions on a cylinder .",
    "a complete classification of the conformal boundary condition on the torus has also been given @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to compute the partition function on a torus by identifying the states at the two ends of a cylinder through the trace operation .",
    "this may be interpreted as inserting defect line into the system along non contractible circles of the cylinder , before closing it into a torus .",
    "the effect of this operation is to `` twist '' the boundary conditions . in statistical mechanics",
    ", this is a familiar operation , often referred to as a `` seam '' .    to understand the effects of boundary conditions , it is especially valuable to study model systems which have exact results @xcite . two - dimensional models of statistical mechanics have long served as a proving ground in attempts to understand critical behavior and to test the general ideas of finite - size scaling .",
    "very few of them have been solved exactly and the ising model is the most prominent example .",
    "the ising model with a defect line goes back at least to bariev @xcite and mccoy and perk @xcite .",
    "the interpretation in terms of conformal invariance was started by turban @xcite and henkel and patkos @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for a system of @xmath13 equidistant infinitely long defect lines , the conformal spectrum , and hence the modular invariant partition function , is given in terms of so(2n)-kac - moody - virasoro algebras , of central charge c = n ( see @xcite for the explicit formulas , including the partition function ) .",
    "@xcite takes up the same question in terms of an orbifold construction .",
    "see also ref .",
    "modified boundary conditions and defect lines also arise in distinct physical situations . for instance , different types of boundary critical phenomena can be identified in uniaxial antiferromagnets on distinct surfaces @xcite and the local magnetisation exponent in the ising model with a defect line has been measured as the corner exponent of a 3d ising model @xcite . our goal is not to discuss defect lines in general , but rather to specialise to a very peculiar type , namely the only one which can be treated in terms of unitary conformal characters .",
    "since onsager obtained the exact solution of the two - dimensional ising model with cylindrical boundary conditions in 1944 @xcite , exact treatments of ising models on different two - dimensional surfaces have been continuously attempted to address different two - dimensional topologies @xcite .",
    "the partition function for the ising model on finite lattices has been calculated exactly for many different boundary conditions , including toroidal @xcite , the mobius strip and the klein bottle @xcite , as well as self - dual @xcite , helical @xcite , and brascamp and kunz boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "additionally systems with cylindrical boundary condition in one direction and free , fixed and mixed boundary condition in another direction have been investigated @xcite . quite recently @xcite we reported the exact solution of the critical ising model in two dimensions with a specific defect , but the letter format of the paper did not permit the presentation of all the details of the analysis .",
    "in this paper we present the extended version of ref .",
    "@xcite , which will include also the calculation of the universal structure constants for descendent states generated by the ope of the primary fields .",
    "at the critical point @xmath14 the asymptotic finite - size scaling behavior of the critical free energy ( @xmath15 ) and the inverse correlation lengths ( @xmath16 ) of an infinitely long 2d strip of finite width @xmath17 has the form @xcite",

    "a central element of the modern theory of bulk critical phenomena is the division into ( bulk ) universality classes . in general ,",
    "each bulk universality class of critical phenomena splits into several boundary universality classes . for the ising universality class",
    "there are nine different boundary universality classes .",
    "six of them are associated with the cylinder geometry and three boundary universality classes are associated with the strip geometry .    for the ising model on an infinitely long strip",
    "there are three different conformal boundary conditions , related to the three possible values of the conformal weight ( @xmath34 ) @xcite : free , fixed @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) and mixed with @xmath37 for fixed @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) boundary conditions the spins are fixed to the same ( or opposite ) values on two sides of the strip .",
    "mixed boundary conditions correspond to free boundary conditions on one side of the strip , and fixed boundary conditions on the other . in the terminology of surface critical phenomena @xcite",
    "these three boundary universality classes : free , fixed ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) and mixed correspond to `` ordinary '' , `` extraordinary '' and `` special '' surface critical behavior , respectively .    for the ising model on an infinitely long cylinder",
