    "top quark pair production near threshold will be an important process at the ilc to determine the top quark mass @xmath1 , decay width @xmath2 and the qcd coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "because of high precision required for these quantities , the theoretical uncertainty of the cross section should be reduced below a few percent level . for this purpose ,",
    "the nnnlo qcd calculation of the cross section is mandatory .",
    "recently we computed the nnnlo correction @xcite to the quarkonium wave - functions at the origin , which governs the magnitude of the threshold cross section . in this proceedings",
    "we present an analysis of the combined result of the papers @xcite . for the details of the calculation",
    "we refer to the original papers .",
    "the production cross section of a heavy quark pair @xmath4 is related to the two - point function of the vector current @xmath5 in qcd : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 in the center of mass frame of the @xmath4 , and @xmath9 . near the @xmath4 threshold",
    ", the two - point function exhibits the bound - state contribution @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy of the bound state with the principal quantum number @xmath12 and @xmath13 specifies the physical sheet in the analytic continuation .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath14 control the position and the height of the resonances in the threshold cross section , respectively .",
    "the heavy quark threshold dynamics is non - relativistic ( nr ) , so we utilize an effective field theory , non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) for the quark ( @xmath15 ) and anti - quark ( @xmath16 ) . in nrqcd",
    "the vector current is mapped onto @xmath17 where @xmath18 are matching coefficients , having perturbative series expansions in @xmath3 .",
    "thus the two - point function reduces to the one in nrqcd , whose bound - state contribution is expressed by the quarkonium wave - function at the origin , @xmath19 , @xmath20(x)[\\chi^\\dag\\sigma^i\\psi](0)|\\omega\\rangle \\stackrel{e\\rightarrow e_n}{= } 2n_c(d-1)\\frac{|\\psi_n(0)|^2}{e_n-(e+i\\,0)}+\\mbox{non - pole}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pre - factor @xmath21 is due to spin@xmath22color@xmath22space degrees of freedom .",

    "the wave - function as well as the matching coefficients possess scale dependence because of their uv and ir divergences characteristic to effective theory calculations , which we treat according to the threshold expansion @xcite . the physical quantity measured in experiments is @xmath14 , a scale - invariant combination of the matching coefficients and the nr wave - function . in the next section we present semi - analytical formulae for all the building blocks needed to get @xmath26 , and discuss the importance of the nnnlo correction for stabilizing the perturbative result for the quarkonium wave - functions at the origin against scale variation",
    "the wave - function at the origin to nnnlo consists of the coulomb contribution , the non - coulomb potential contribution , and the ultra - soft correction in nrqcd .",
    "the coulomb contribution is finite and calculated analytically in @xcite .",
