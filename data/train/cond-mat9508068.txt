    "in recent years the understanding of the effects of disorder in the physics of metals , semiconductors and amorphous systems has made a tremendous progress .",
    "this vigorous development was motivated to a great extent by a thorough understanding of how strongly disorder effects determine the behavior of real physical systems . the success of the various analytical descriptions which have been considered , however",
    ", has always been determined by the relative simplicity to which approximations could be reduced , in order to keep the theory tractable analytically , without losing its capability to account for the most important physical aspects .",
    "one of the most successful approximations to match these requirements has been the coherent potential approximation cpa developed by soven @xcite , taylor @xcite , and extended by leath @xcite , velick @xcite and many others ( see ref . for a review ) .",
    "in contrast to many other approximations for the procedure of configurational averaging in disordered systems , the cpa is capable of interpolating correctly between the limits of weak @xcite and strong disorder @xcite as well as low and high impurity concentrations .",
    "therefore it is also able to predict accurately the formation of impurity bound states turning into split - off impurity bands as the impurity concentration is increased .",
    "extensions of the single site cpa to include scattering from clusters of impurities are still today the only existing analytic theories that allow for a calculation of the density of states in disordered systems such that a reasonable versimilitude is attained @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with the cpa , is the relative complexity of the self consistent equations which have to be solved in more accurate extensions of the theory .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a more differentiated analysis of two particle properties within the cpa building on the single site approximation ( ssa ) in which it was developed originally .",
    "our novel treatment should be especially useful for applications to binary substitutional alloys in all regimes of disorder . following an earlier paper by velick @xcite , in which the regular two particle theory within the cpa was first introduced and which will be referred to hereafter as * i *",
    ", the theory of weighted single particle resolvents @xcite is extended to a properly weighted two particle theory .",
    "weighting of a green s function in this context means that through the application of appropriate operators to the unaveraged resolvent , restrictions are made on the type of alloy component of either or both of the sites on which the particle starts and terminates its motion . upon averaging , this results in a statistical weight being attributed to the averaged unrestricted resolvent with possibly separate additive terms .    on the average ,",
    "therefore , contributions to a full two particle green s function in terms of constituent components can be resolved .",
    "this allows for a better understanding of how several physical processes contribute to a cumulative behavior as the principal parameters of the system are varied and it can therefore be used in an analysis of further effects which differentiates between these components .",
    "we have structured the paper as follows : in section ii the important features of the single particle cpa for diagonal disorder are recapitulated and relations which are important to the calculation of the corresponding two particle green s functions are established . in section iii",
    "we calculate the fourier transforms of a class of weighted two particle functions which are kept as general as possible . for that reason only a representative choice of weightings",
    "are calculated explicitly , since other weights can be obtained in an analogous fashion .",
    "section iv is devoted to possible applications of weighted two particle functions in linear response theory , and the peculiarities of two different classes of such functions are discussed in detail , which we have selected to cover a large range of conceivable applications .    in the third part of section iv the behavior of one class of functions discussed before",
    "is examined in a split band limit ( strong disorder ) .",
    "section v is devoted to a numerical study of the splitting into several components of an interband absorption spectrum of a disordered alloy .",
    "section vi in conclusion discusses the implications and possible further applications of the results obtained throughout this work .",
    "we consider a binary substitutional alloy @xmath1 on a simple totally disordered monoatomic lattice on which each site is occupied by either an @xmath2 or a @xmath3-component with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . since by symmetry it is only necessary to consider concentrations between @xmath6 , we restrict our investigation to this region and define @xmath7 as the impurity and @xmath3 as the host component of the alloy .    to simplify further calculations we consider diagonal disorder only , i.e. a hamiltonian of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the periodic part and the @xmath10 are single site contributions to a random disorder potential which assume either the value @xmath11 or @xmath12 with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 , depending on whether the site @xmath13 is an impurity or part of the host material . in principle one could also have introduced a symmetric model for the disorder , but as it turns out the amount of algebra is somewhat reduced by the asymmetric definition , while switching from one form to the other does not present any difficulty .",
    "the propagator of the disordered medium @xmath14 relates to the one of a pure host medium ( pure @xmath3-phase ) @xmath15 through the dyson equation @xmath16    the cpa for a disordered medium is introduced by the usual method @xcite of placing the impurities in a self - consistent medium such that the the averaged propagator of this effective medium fulfills the relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cpa single particle self energy .",
    "@xmath18 itself is determined by the self consistency condition that the average of the total scattering of a particle in the effective medium be zero .",
    "this total scattering is described by the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is corresponding t - matrix of the problem and the self consistency condition is therefore @xmath21 . in the ssa",
    "an additional requirement is made through the condition that the total scattering off a single site @xmath13 be zero .",
    "this scattering is described by the single site contribution to the t - matrix @xmath22 which is defined as @xmath23 \\label{a3}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the site diagonal average propagator and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the single site decompositions of @xmath27 and @xmath18 , such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the average of the disorder potential @xmath27 alone amounts to @xmath30 this along with the average of ( [ a3 ] ) set to zero determines @xmath18 to be @xmath31    one can now define conditional or weighted propagators @xcite which explicitly describe the propagation of a particle between partly or completely specified types of sites by multiplying a normalized version of the random potential onto them . for example , @xmath32 describes the motion of a particle commencing on an impurity site and ending at an arbitrary other site in the medium , since @xmath27 will be zero if the first site of the function is a host .",
    "similarly , @xmath33 describes a situation where both sites are required to be impurities for the function not to be zero . upon averaging over all configurations ,",
    "the green s functions become translationally invariant and the following relationships between the averaged weighted and unweighted functions can be obtained @xmath34 the second term corrects the site diagonal elements when @xmath35 and uses identity ( [ a3a ] ) . from here on , other weighted functions can be calculated by probability conservation .",
    "it is found that @xmath36 it is our goal in the present paper to establish the two particle analogues of these weighted green s functions , i.e. jointly averaged products of such functions including the coherent scattering which induces correlations in the joint propagation of two particles .    in order to deduce these",
    "jointly averaged weighted functions , we first need to obtain the non - averaged weighted functions , starting with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in a representation such that no products between the disorder potential @xmath27 and the unweighted single particle function @xmath14 occur . to accomplish this",

    "in this section a general weighted two particle theory involving two different bands is established from which the case of two particles moving in a single band can also be immediately obtained .",
    "the calculation for the unweighted two particle function has been made in * i*. as a main result of that work the appropriate vertex corrections for the cpa were obtained which account for the coherent scattering processes of two particles that arise in the otherwise non - interacting two particle function through the averaging process .",
    "we follow the outline of velick s reasoning to obtain the proper weights for two choices of the functions @xmath42 .",
    "the labels @xmath43 indicate the kind of weight  either an impurity , a host or no weight  which is attributed to the first and second site of the respective function .",
    "@xmath44 represents a generalized operator coupling the two single particle functions and @xmath45 and @xmath46 label two possibly different bands on which the respective single particle resolvents are defined .",
    "the positions of the weights within one single green s function are thereby important , since the disordered medium before averaging is neither homogeneous nor isotropic and thus the non - averaged green s functions depend non - trivially on both arguments . in principle there",
    "now would be 80 ( ! ) possible ways of applying specific weights to these functions before averaging .",
    "however , in most cases , even if different bands are involved , only two particle functions having an equal kind of weighting on its single particle constituents will be needed in most applications .",
    "later , we will consider two particular examples of two particle functions which find frequent use in linear response theory where the operator @xmath44 is diagonal in real space and also only diagonal elements ( or sums of diagonal elements ) of the functions defined above are used . for both cases considered ,",
    "the total choices of weightings reduce to only five different ones , since the first and the second site of the first function will be the same as the second and first site of the second function , respectively , which implies that they must also pairwise bear the same weighting label .    as an example we calculate for a most general choice of @xmath44 only the two functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 in this section ,",
    "since they will prove to be the most useful types of weightings for the cases discussed thereafter and all other ones could be obtained in complete analogy to the calculations presented here .    using the identities ( [ a11 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] )",

    "as shown by velick , @xmath20 can then be replaced in two ways by a closed set of equations , namely @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 due to the requirement that @xmath60 and the single site decomposition of @xmath20 from ( [ b11 ] ) it is possible to decompose averages on different sites to give @xmath61 this also implies that @xmath62 .",

    "now , we proceed to calculate the single weighted function @xmath99 . from ( [ b4 ] )",
    "we get @xmath100 using ( [ a13 ] ) , this can be recast into @xmath101 which can be readily solved since the term @xmath102 exactly corresponds to the vertex part of the unweighted function which is known from * i * @xmath103 thus , the fourier transform @xmath104 can be obtained using the solution for the unweighted two particle function and equations ( [ b28 ] ) , ( [ b30 ] ) and ( [ b31 ] ) to yield @xmath105 using ( [ b37 ] ) this can be written as @xmath106 it is important to indicate at this point that the solution for a single weighted function in which the weights have been swapped to the inside , i.e. @xmath107 , will not be the same as the one just obtained . a similar type of calculation yields instead of ( [ bb4 ] ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "since we have now obtained expressions for the fourier transformed site diagonal elements of some of the impurity weighted two particle functions , we are also able to find their respective off diagonal parts by inserting into the appropriate bethe - salpeter equations ( ( [ b22 ] ) in the case of the double weighted function ) . other types of weighted functions can be calculated from here by setting up the corresponding equations in analogy to ( [ b4 ] ) and ( [ b5 ] ) from the single particle functions .",
    "in particular , to obtain the corresponding host weighted functions one can apply the weights @xmath110 to the single particle resolvents from either side , but the form of this weight already suggests that host weighted properties can always be deduced by adding and/or subtracting corresponding unweighted / impurity weighted functions .",
    "for the most general case the set of closed equations will be quite large and for that reason we will in the following deduce these equations only in some more specific cases .",
    "the most obvious application of a two particle theory as introduced above is in linear response theory , i.e. in calculating weighted susceptibilities .",
    "the study of weighted functions in this context helps to determine how such quantities as susceptibilities and transport coefficients are constituted ( on the average ) from processes on different components of the alloy .",
    "a further advantage of such a differentiation is that it allows for a more refined treatment of further renormalizations to the considered quantities once further interactions are introduced into the problem .",
    "the standard expression employed in linear response theory is a generalized kubo formula @xmath111 thereby @xmath112 stands for a generalized type of susceptibility characterizing the linear response of an observable @xmath113 to an external perturbation coupling into the hamiltonian through the operator @xmath114 .",

    "our particular interest focuses on the operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 which we now take to have the following diagonal form @xmath124 to examine the behavior of the weighted functions further under such a constraint it is useful to consider the two cases : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is an explicitly specified site and @xmath127 the first case arises in a treatment of the response from local interactions such as for example the space dependent exchange interaction between spin impurities ( rkky interaction @xcite ) submerged in a system otherwise containing non - magnetic disorder @xcite .",
    "the second case is widely used in calculations of the optical response in metals and semiconductors@xcite , since the exciting optical fields can be taken as uniform over space with approximate momentum @xmath128 and the optical matrix elements describing transitions between bands of different angular momentum symmetry are usually well approximated as constants .    in both cases the restriction to only consider diagonal elements of two particle functions reduces the set of closed equations for all possible weightings to @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 it follows , that for this case the calculation of only @xmath132 and @xmath133 is sufficient to also obtain the remaining mixed and host weighted functions .",
    "we start to consider the case of ( [ c2 ] ) first .",
    "the response of a system at some point @xmath134 in space to a perturbation applied at point @xmath135 has a wide range of applicability . disregarding the coupling constants which simply scale the result we assume that @xmath136 and @xmath137 , where the choice of the origin is arbitrary . in a slightly different notation",
    "the calculation of the double weighted function corresponds to evaluating @xmath138 .    for the rkky interaction mentioned before , which couples spins at a distance @xmath139 through the electronic spin susceptibility of electrons in the conduction band ,",
    "the two - particle time dependent function is to be fourier transformed and to be taken at two identical single particle energies @xcite .",
    "if the spins are at impurity sites , the weighted functions must be used to describe the problem adequately .",
    "earlier treatments @xcite neglected the vertex corrections and it is proposed to investigate the effect of their inclusion in a separate publication .    in this as in other problems the self - interaction @xmath140 can be neglected for most purposes , which implies that it will be sufficient to calculate only the term @xmath53 from ( [ b7 ] ) , since all terms occurring in @xmath98 from ( [ b8 ] ) will vanish for @xmath141 , since the disorder potential @xmath27 is a diagonal matrix which vanishes identically for off - diagonal terms . to clarify the meaning of the quantity which is obtained through this special choice of @xmath113 and @xmath114 , we look at how the corresponding bethe - salpeter ( b - s ) equation can be rewritten for the case of a unweighted two particle green s function as introduced in equations ( 22 ) of ref . .",
    "in the single site approximation the b - s equation for the unweighted function reads @xmath142 where we have rewritten @xmath143 and @xmath144 for the fourier transforms from before ( [ b28 ] ) - ( [ b31 ] ) this amounts to @xmath145   = { \\cal a}_k .\\label{ca6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using ( [ ca5 ] ) and ( [ ca6 ] ) in connection with ( [ bb4 ] ) and ( [ bb6 ] ) the result for the single weighted functions is independent of whether the impurity weights are applied to the interior or to the exterior of the single particle resolvents , such that @xmath146 .",
    "indeed it is not hard to show that other arbitrary distributions of two impurity weights also give the same results as long as there is one weight applied to each resolvent . the same is of course true for host related properties .",
    "accordingly , @xmath147 from ( [ b34_5 ] ) in the previous section goes over to @xmath148 and similarly @xmath93 from equation ( [ b35 ] ) to @xmath149 we remember that the fourier transform of the unweighted two particle greens function is @xmath150    phenomenologically , one can scrutinize the uncorrelated limit where @xmath151 for which in ( [ ca8 ] ) the @xmath152- dependent part of @xmath93 behaves as @xmath153 which is the correct limiting result for a product of two averaged double impurity weighted single particle functions @xmath154 or the weighted two particle function without coherent corrections .",
    "however , taking this limit is reasonable only in special cases since generally the vertex @xmath76 depends on the self energy @xmath18",
    ". it will be appropriate to take in a weak disorder limit ( virtual crystal limit ) since for @xmath155 the cpa predicts that @xmath156 and @xmath157 which means that @xmath76 approaches zero faster than @xmath158 in this limit .",
    "one should also note at this point , that although it is apparent that the term @xmath159 , which arises in the difference of the fourier transforms @xmath160 and @xmath161 , originates from the difference in the diagonal parts of their respective real space green s functions , it can not be neglected in this treatment .",
    "when @xmath76 is finite , this term is multiplied with other @xmath162dependent quantities and thus contributes to the off diagonal elements as well . written in terms of @xmath161 , ( [ ca8 ] ) can be cast into @xmath163 if again diagonal terms in real space are neglected , i.e. @xmath162independent quantities in @xmath162space , it can be shown that ( [ ca11 ] ) can be cast into the compact form @xmath164 where we have introduced @xmath165 , whereby @xmath166 is independent of @xmath152 . according to the definition of @xmath167",

    "the fact that in the single weighted case the same weighting factor occurs once as opposed to twice for the double weighted one is structurally equivalent to the results for the single particle theory .",
    "although retrospectively that might not be surprising , it is also quite interesting in view of the fact that for the most general case of the previous section the weighting factors in ( [ b35 ] ) and ( [ bb5 ] ) almost look alike were it not for the difference in the pre - factors , i.e. @xmath160 in the former and @xmath172 in the latter case .    in principle",
    "all other functions can be derived now using the set of relations ( [ c4 ] ) - ( [ c6 ] ) .",
    "however , one can save a considerable amount of algebra by recalling the following relation which holds in the transition from impurity to host related properties in the cpa @xmath173 starting from the definition of the vertex @xmath174 in ( [ b21 ] ) and the cpa condition @xmath175 one finds that @xmath176^{-1 } \\label{ca17}\\ ] ] which in a single band case ( @xmath177 ) readily simplifies to the form first introduced by leath @xcite @xmath178 with the relation ( [ a3a ] ) between @xmath24 and @xmath18 the weighting factor for the single weighted impurity function from ( [ ca15 ] ) reduces to @xmath179 correspondingly , the factor for the double weighted function is the square of this quantity .",
    "one can now employ ( [ c4 ] ) and ( [ c5 ] ) to find the weights for the single host- and the impurity - host weighted functions , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath180 and @xmath181 which by means of ( [ c6 ] ) gives @xmath182 note that this could also have been expected from the transformation property ( [ ca16 ] ) .",
    "the impurity and host weights as represented in ( [ ca19 ] ) and ( [ ca20 ] ) are immediately seen to be the two contributions summing to @xmath183 in ( [ ca17 ] ) .",
    "thus , even though there are many different possible representations of the two band vertex , the representation in ( [ ca17 ] ) shows that the transition from impurity to host properties leaves @xmath76 invariant .",
    "a notable feature about the weights calculated in this section is that they are independent of any wavevectors and only multiply the unweighted function as scalar energy dependent factors .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the single site approximation .      in this section",
    "we evaluate a form of the two particle functions needed in the calculation of the linear response absorption in a disordered solid .",
    "we take the operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the characteristic form of dipole operators similar to the one in ( [ c3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the dipole matrix elements be essentially constant , such that @xmath184 .",
    "this choice corresponds to applications for the description of processes involving transitions between bands of different angular momentum symmetry such as required by the selection rule for optical processes at at zero total momentum @xcite . at the end of this sub - section",
    "we will also give for completeness a short account of the calculation of linear response conductivities in disordered solids .",
    "for the above choice of @xmath185 the calculation of the term @xmath53 in ( [ b22 ] ) is greatly simplified compared to before , but it will be necessary now to also consider total diagonal terms , since the sums over all states in @xmath186 couple all sites and hence all contributions coming from term @xmath98 in ( [ b8 ] ) have to be included .    as a consequence of the introduction of the dipole operator the main change arising in the result for @xmath53",
    "is that the site diagonal elements @xmath187 and @xmath188 as well as @xmath189 are now actually independent of @xmath13 @xcite . since @xmath113 now couples the functions to its left and right like a matrix product ,",

    "from there it is also seen that the single weighted function will have the same weight as calculated in ( [ ca19 ] ) for the corresponding function in the exchange coupling case .",
    "we find @xmath213 and by means of ( [ c4 ] ) - ( [ c6 ] ) @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 ^ 2 +   \\frac { \\lambda   f_a f_b } { v_a v_b}. \\label{cc14}\\ ] ]    comparing the results of the last two sub - sections , it becomes clear that the several weights obtained are essentially universal .",
    "the main difference in the absorption case as compared to the susceptibility one comes from the diagonal terms which have to be kept in the double weighted functions .",
    "the single weighted analogues are void of this difficulty and the weighting factors are identical for both cases .",
    "so far we had omitted to consider a form of the two particle functions which is needed for conductivity calculations . however , velick @xcite showed for the unweighted functions that the vertex @xmath63 vanishes in the corresponding expression for the conductivity , due to the antisymmetry of the dipole matrix elements in @xmath152-space if they are taken between bloch states of a non interacting fermi system in a crystal with inversion symmetry .",
    "the same is also true for the weighted case and effectively the weighted functions which would have to be used for such calculations would just consist of products of the corresponding single particle quantities .",
    "this however turns out to be a general deficiency of the cpa in the single site approximation since due to the multiple scattering exclusions , only ladders of nested diagrams are used in calculating the total contribution of the coherent scattering .",
    "the cpa therefore neglects higher order two particle correlations which are in fact non - zero and contribute markedly to the conductivity .",
    "langer and neal @xcite have shown that the so called `` maximally crossed '' diagrams , i.e. diagrams which have a maximal crossing of coherent particle - particle scattering lines actually contribute the leading part  in the order of the expansion considered  to the full two particle disorder vertex for the conductivity in an otherwise non - interacting system .",
    "for the case of interacting fermi systems , however , the presence of the interactions is sufficient to destroy the aforementioned antisymmetry and thus also the terms already included in the vertex of a single site two particle cpa as discussed here will give a finite contribution to the conductivity in real systems .",
    "as already indicated , in contrast to many other theories of disorder , the cpa interpolates correctly to the limits of strong disorder and high concentrations . in this situation",
    "each band splits into two components of strength @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , which represent largely separate @xmath2 and @xmath3-type excitations .",
    "an intuitive consideration of the underlying physics in this limit suggests , that the correct description of an absorption process should predict that the overlap integral for transitions between sites pertaining to different alloy components will gradually decrease and thus in reverse , that transitions between sites of equal type will be more and more favored . in the following ,",
    "we prove that the cpa of weighted two particle functions predicts this behavior correctly which makes it useful for a better quantitative understanding of absorptive and dispersive processes in strongly disordered alloys .",
    "the corresponding single particle theory must fail in this respect , since it will weight the occurring transitions only with the products of concentrations of sites involved in these transitions .    to illustrate this",
    "we assume that our material components @xmath7 and @xmath3 have corresponding single site energies @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 , @xmath220 for the two bands respectively and the carriers have become totally localized , i.e. their effective mass goes to infinity , or vice versa the bandwidths involved go to zero . the potentials @xmath221 and @xmath222 are then defined as @xmath223 and the single particle site diagonal green s functions go over to @xmath224 where @xmath225 labels the corresponding band .",
    "thus , if a two particle theory is constructed from single particle properties only , and coherent terms in the two particle scattering are neglected , this leads to peaks in the absorption spectrum as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the energies at which the peaks are centered are shown in row 2 and their relative weight for the uncorrelated average is shown in the row 3 .    in the following we show for the limit of strong disorder how , upon introducing the vertex corrections in conjunction with the appropriate weighting factors for the two respective components ,",
    "the expected transitions are filtered out correctly with their appropriate transition strengths and the spurious crossed terms are suppressed as shown in row 4 of table [ table1 ] . defining @xmath226 @xmath24 and @xmath18 can be rewritten as @xmath227 and the vertex @xmath76 given by ( [ ca17 ] ) can be written @xmath228 \\left [ x_b - v_b(1-c ) \\right ]   \\left [ c x_a x_b + ( 1-c)(x_a - v_a)(x_b - v_b ) \\right ] } \\label{sb7}.\\ ] ] the impurity weight @xmath229 can be represented as @xmath230 and equally the host weight @xmath231 as @xmath232 it is now evident , that the impurity weighted quantities are proportional to @xmath4 and the host weighted ones to @xmath5 and not the other way around as their the appearance in terms of their weighting factors might superficially have suggested .",
    "the correction factor coming from the diagonal terms in the double weighted functions can be recast into @xmath233 furthermore , the unweighted but vertex corrected two particle propagator @xmath234 assumes the form @xmath235 after further algebra one can show , that in this limit the weighted functions can be expressed as @xmath236 which is exactly what is expected to happen physically in this limit .",
    "the crossed terms in the transition are canceled out  hence the crossed function in ( [ sb13_5 ] ) goes to zero  and the double weighted functions become identical to the single weighted ones , since now effectively only the totally site diagonal element @xmath237 still contributes to the transitions , which implies that only two possibilities for weighting the two particle functions remain , namely as @xmath238 and @xmath239 . as could be expected from a theory which properly describes the strong disorder limit",
    "the transition strengths now distribute with the concentrations @xmath4 and @xmath5 between the @xmath240 and @xmath241 transitions , respectively , such as shown in row 4 of table [ table1 ] .",
    "this feature may in reverse be used to derive the total diagonal element @xmath242 for all ranges of disorder . by requiring @xmath243",
    "we find @xmath244 the weighted versions of this element are obtained by just multiplying the corresponding single weights from ( [ cc11 ] ) and ( [ cc12 ] ) on to it .",
    "moreover , @xmath242 is equivalent to the @xmath245 component of the two particle function calculated for the finite range susceptibility in the last sub - section . in terms of the notation",
    "introduced there it reads @xmath246 which would have been harder to evaluate starting from that representation .",
    "the total site diagonal element thus decouples into the corresponding site diagonal single particle functions with an appropriate correction term accounting for the coherent processes .",
    "in this subsection , in order to exemplify the general results , we discuss numerical results obtained for the optical absorption in a non - degenerate binary semiconductor alloy for a given model density of states .",
    "we are thus able to show how a cpa type of polarization , including vertex corrections , decomposes into contributions originating from single alloy components as the strength of the disorder is increased thus eventually causing the joint density of states to split into several components ( up to three different ones for the double weighted case ) .    in all our calculations",
    "we have used a semi elliptic density of states for a pair of 3-d conduction and valence bands as introduced in ref . for the single particle cpa , i.e. @xmath247 where @xmath225 labels either the conduction @xmath248 or valence @xmath249 , and @xmath250 is the half - width of the band considered .",
    "this has the advantage that the self consistent cpa equation for the self energy @xmath251 is a third degree polynomial which can be solved analytically .    to understand the effects that arise from genuine two particle behavior as compared to those expected from the single particle cpa , we recapitulate some of the features of the single particle theory first , mainly building on the treatment presented in ref .",
    "it is established there , that depending on the concentration and disorder strength relative to the bandwidth , an impurity band is eventually split off while in this split regime under some circumstances the cpa self energy exhibits a pole .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a reproduction of the `` phase '' diagram first presented there , indicating how the several regions are separated .",
    "it can be seen that for a disorder strength @xmath252 the bands always split into @xmath2 and @xmath3-components , whereas the splitting occurs earlier as the concentration @xmath4 is reduced , going down to @xmath253 as @xmath254 .",
    "we have calculated the linear polarizability of the medium by employing a kubo formula as introduced in ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we continue assume that the optical matrix elements are essentially constant and that such elements are the same for both alloy components and we hence normalize them to unity . the optical absorption is the negative imaginary part of the retarded polarizability of the disordered medium @xmath255 , which can be formally written as @xmath256 whereby the @xmath152-integration is understood to be carried out after the configurational average has been performed , since before that both resolvents would depend non - trivially on two momentum variables .",
    "we consider our system at zero temperature and follow partly the method used in ref . for our calculations . at @xmath257",
    ", the polarization can be obtained as the energy convolution around the conduction band branch cut of the @xmath152-summed vertex corrected two particle function @xmath258 , such that @xmath259 where we have taken over the following definitions from ref .",

    "we assume that the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band is positive and that of a hole in the valence band is negative .",
    "accordingly we have chosen the upper choice of signs in ( [ n6 ] ) and ( [ n7 ] ) for our calculations .    to be able to analyze the obtained results with regard to the effect of the the inclusion of vertex corrections we first consider qualitatively the features that would be expected from the transition process represented by the energy convolution in ( [ n3 ] ) in an intermediate regime of disorder , if the configurational average in the two particle function is decoupled and effectively only single particle properties are employed .",
    "this would correspond to replacing @xmath234 from ( [ n4 ] ) by @xmath266 from ( [ n5])in ( [ n3 ] ) .",
    "we assume for now that the concentration be about 0.5 and the bands have just split by a notable amount . with the semi - elliptic bands used , the transition process can be represented as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the disorder strengths give approximately the distance between the centers of the single bands .",
    "the convolution of two separated finite bands , occurring in @xmath266 , would yield a set of finite bands in the joint density of states ( dos ) whose width is the sum of the widths of the contributing components .",
    "two cases are considered where the band offsets of the @xmath2 and @xmath3-components of the alloy are in equal or opposite directions corresponding to parallel or anti - parallel disorder .    in the case of parallel disorder",
    ", this would amount to the @xmath240 and @xmath241 -transitions lying in the center of the joint dos , framed by the contributions from the @xmath267 and @xmath268 -transitions upper and lower end respectively as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . at @xmath269",
    "these regions would have relative distribution of weighted states of @xmath270 from lower end : center : higher end . in the case of anti - parallel disorder",
    "the picture should be similar with the only difference that the spectrum is turned inside - out with the @xmath271 and @xmath272 components on the top and the bottom end of the joint dos and the mixed transitions in the center , again with a distribution of @xmath270 .",
    "the calculations in the previous section for the split band case strongly suggest that the vertex corrections will increasingly suppress the cross transitions as the disorder strength is increased , which is verified in our numerical results .",
    "indeed , our results show that this suppression is already displayed quite strongly in an intermediate disorder range , i.e. in a regime where the single bands just begin to split .",
    "the appended plots in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show cumulative absorption spectra calculated from ( [ n3 ] ) as well as their single and double weighted components for parallel and anti - parallel disorder of various strengths , covering both the joint and the split band regime .",
    "the conduction band half - width is normalized to unity and the valence band half - width is taken to be @xmath273 .",
    "the concentration of impurities is fixed to @xmath274 in order to study the high - concentration behavior rather than dilute impurity effects .    in the transitional region",
    "when the disorder strengths start to exceed the single particle half - bandwidths @xmath275 and the conduction and valence bands start to split we observe the following behavior : in the case of parallel disorder shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the spectrum starts to exhibit a discontinuity in its derivatives at the flanks accounting for a pair of mixed components splitting off sideways from the main contribution . at",
    "the transition point the contributions of the flanks relative to the central bulk part are approximately distributed in a ratio of @xmath276 . in the case of anti - parallel disorder shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the suppression of the mixed transitions is even stronger so that as soon as the single bands split the crossed transitions cancel out entirely within the numerical accuracy and the joint density of states starts to exhibit a gap between two separate contributions which mainly consist of @xmath2 and @xmath3-transitions , respectively .    in a regime of strong disorder ,",
    "further beyond the splitting of the single bands as shown in the last plots of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , one finds that over large regions the single and uniformly double weighted contributions coincide almost exactly , implying that the spectrum is built almost entirely from the total diagonal element of the two particle function , which we had calculated at the end of section iv .",
    "the total diagonal element can be obtained as an independent @xmath152-sum over the two single particle resolvents involved .",
    "this situation represents a breakdown of the @xmath152-selection rule which holds in pure media .",
    "if the splitting of @xmath277 into single weighted components @xmath278 is considered and the result is compared in appearance with the splitting into components of the site diagonal single particle function @xcite @xmath279 one finds that the single and the two particle behavior appear to be strikingly similar in the case of anti - parallel disorder , as can be seen if the plots for the imaginary part of the single particle function shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are compared to the ones for the corresponding parameters in the two particle case of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( third and fourth plot from the front ) .    in a system without disorder",
    "this similarity is evident",
    "if there are no further local interactions in the problem , since the non - interacting two particle motion decouples into a center of mass and a relative co - ordinate and while the center of mass motion can be set to zero , the relative one can be mapped onto a single particle co - ordinate . upon the addition of the disorder",
    ", this decoupling fails to work and it can only be regained by using an appropriate configurational averaging procedure . however ,",
    "if in the presence of disorder an average is only performed on a single particle level , thus omitting average induced two particle correlations the reduction obviously fails to work , as is seen through comparing the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] showing a spectrum calculated without the vertex corrections with the ones for the corresponding parameter values of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which properly include these corrections .",
    "the results show , that in regimes of intermediate and strong disorder the influence of the vertex corrections is very substantial .    in comparison to the single weighted ( two fold ) splitting the double weighted ( three fold )",
    "splitting exhibits a rather curious behavior .",
    "even though the components @xmath280im@xmath281 and @xmath280im@xmath282 lie underneath their single weighted complements @xmath280im@xmath283 and @xmath280im@xmath284 in some parts of the spectra , which one might expect to happen globally on first thought , they either coincide with them or even exceed them in other parts  sometimes to such an extent that they reach beyond the cumulative function . however , it has to be noted , that these components , like the unweighted function , are always uniformly positive in sign , and therefore exhibit the correct analytic behavior that a function defined on this footing has to satisfy .",
    "it is required that these components be positive definite , because the net absorption in the medium must always be positive unless the system is excited out of equilibrium , which we do not consider here . in the preceding discussion",
    "we have assumed for convenience that the optical matrix elements between states of different components of the alloy are equal .",
    "if different optical cross sections ( matrix elements ) @xmath285 are distinguished for @xmath2 and @xmath3-atoms the weighted contributions to yield the integrand of ( [ n3 ] ) would sum as @xmath286 this shows that it would be possible to observe one of the functions @xmath281 or @xmath282 predominantly if either @xmath287 or @xmath288 happens to be much larger than the other .",
    "the mixed function @xmath289 , however , will never be a separately observable quantity in a general case , no matter how the cross sections @xmath287 and @xmath288 scale relatively and therefore not so rigid criteria for its analyticity apply as for the uniformly double weighted functions .",
    "in the previous sections we have obtained expressions for a wide class of weighted two particle green s functions . the large choice for possible weightings is substantially reduced as restrictions are made to functions which would be useful in linear response theory . in both cases which are discussed for this kind of application",
    ", only five different weighted functions remain of which only two are genuinely independent .",
    "the structure of the weighting process is closely related to that derived for the single particle theory with the main difference that now the weights also depend significantly on the cpa vertex corrections .",
    "the calculation for the split band limit , the domain in which the cpa is superior to most of the other theories of disordered systems , gives a direct insight into how the properly weighted cpa extracts the correct limiting behavior from different possible physical processes .",
    "some care is needed in interpreting the precise physical meaning of the weights , since they are obtained for the averaged functions , which describe the disordered medium as effectively homogeneous .",
    "the concept of the propagation of a particle between sites of different components is therefore lost in the effective medium as a consequence of averaging and the initial exclusion of specific propagation paths in the unaveraged function leads to the effective weights .",
    "these weights simply account for the average partition in probability for the simultaneous propagation of the particles between partly or completely specified site types at a given pair of energies @xmath290 and @xmath291 .",
    "our numerical results show the general importance of the inclusion of vertex corrections into a properly self consistent two particle formalism .",
    "we managed to visualize that , as a consequence of the inclusion of these average induced two particle correlations , the center of mass and relative motion of the two particle system effectively decouple to a large extent .",
    "we believe that the general method developed here will find applications in various situations where two particle motion is studied in a disordered medium .",
    "the effect of alloying on the electronic susceptibility and hence for example on the rudermann - kittel interaction has already been mentioned . in particular",
    "we believe it can be extended for use in systems where the two particles have a direct interaction , such as the coulomb interaction between carriers occurring in excitons in alloyed systems .",
    "in such a case the static correlations between particles , created by the disorder and accounted for by the vertex corrections , and the dynamic correlations introduced through the carrier - carrier interaction , create additional static - dynamic correlations",
    ". moreover it may be possible that the underlying disorder of the system gives rise to an induced disorder to the carrier - carrier interaction itself .",
