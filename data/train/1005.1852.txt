    "<S> we derive a duality for saturated multi - convex sets : there exists an order anti - isomorphism between nonempty saturated multi - convex sets in a real projective space and those in the dual projective space . in discrete geometry and computational geometry , these results allow to transform a given problem into a dual problem which sometimes is easier to solve . </S>",
