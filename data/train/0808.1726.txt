    "recently , studies in numerical general relativity have shown that merged binary black holes can have a large recoil velocity through anisotropic emission of gravitational waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the maximum velocity would reach @xmath3 , although the actual distribution of kick velocities is very uncertain .",
    "the discovery of such recoiled black holes is important for studies about the growth of black holes as well as the general relativity .",
    "supermassive black holes ( @xmath4 ) at the centers of disk galaxies would be kicked through this mechanism .",
    "although they would be bright just after the kick because of the emission from the accretion disk carried by the black holes , they would soon get dim as the disk is consumed by the black holes @xcite .",
    "however , if the kick velocity of a black hole is not large enough to escape from the host galaxy , it will eventually fall back onto the galactic disk .",
    "if the time - scale of dynamical friction is large enough , it will revolve around the galactic center many times before it finally spirals into the galactic center .",
    "when the black hole passes the galactic disk , it will accrete the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the disk @xcite .",
    "the accretion of the surrounding gas onto an isolated black hole has been studied by several authors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "most of the previous studies focused on stellar mass ( @xmath5 ) or intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ; @xmath6 ) .",
    "the accretion rate and thus the luminosity of a black hole depend on the mass of the black hole and the density of the gas surrounding it ( see equation  [ [ eq : dotm ] ] ) .",
    "since the mass of a stellar - mass black hole is small , its luminosity becomes large enough to be observed only when it plunges into a high density region such as a molecular cloud . on the other hand , in this letter",
    ", we show that a recoiled supermassive black hole can shine even in the ordinary region of a galactic disk because of its huge mass .",
    "we calculate the orbit of a recoiled black hole in a fixed galaxy potential .",
    "the galaxy potential consists of three components , which are @xcite disk , hernquist spheroid , and a logarithmic halo : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 are cylindrical coordinates aligned with the galactic disk , and @xmath13 .",
    "we adopt the parameters for the galaxy .",
    "we take @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16  kpc , @xmath17  kpc , @xmath18  kpc , @xmath19  kpc , and @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is determined so that the circular velocity for the total potential is @xmath22 at @xmath23  kpc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we solve the equation of motion for the supermassive black hole : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the velocity of the black hole , and @xmath26 .",
    "the density of the disk is given by @xmath27^{5/2}(z^2+b^2)^{3/2}}\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "we assume that part of the disk consists of the ism ; its density is represented by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the circulation velocity of the disk is given by @xmath30    the accretion rate of the ism onto the supermassive black hole is given by the bondi - hoyle accretion @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the sound velocity of the ism , and @xmath35 is the relative velocity between the black hole and the surrounding ism .",
    "we assume that the orbit of the black hole is confined on the @xmath36-@xmath12 plane ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "thus , the relative velocity is simply given by @xmath38 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the black hole is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the efficiency .",
    "since the accretion rate is relatively small for the mass of the black hole , the accretion flow would be a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the efficiency follows @xmath41 for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the eddington luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we assume that @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath49 .",
    "we solved equation  ( [ eq : motion ] ) by mathematica 6.0 using a command ndsolve .",
    "the black hole is ejected on the @xmath36-@xmath12 plane at @xmath50 .",
    "the direction of the ejection changes from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , where @xmath51 corresponds to the @xmath12-axis .",
    "we calculate the orbit until @xmath53 , which is chosen to be much larger than the period of revolution and to be smaller than the time - scale of dynamical friction .",
    "the latter is estimated to be @xmath54 @xcite , where @xmath55 is the total density ( disk@xmath56sphere@xmath56halo ) .",
    "the halo component does not much affect the dynamical friction . since @xmath57-body simulations for a spherically symmetric potential showed that the coulomb logarithm is @xmath583 @xcite",
    ", we take @xmath59 .",
    "the effects of dynamical friction on orbits in a complex potential like the one we adopted would be complicated and ideally should be studied with high - resolution @xmath57-body simulations .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq : dynfrc ] ) should be regarded as a rough estimate of the time - scale of the dynamical - friction .",
    "the black hole is placed at the center of the galaxy at @xmath50 . since we do not know the distributions of mass and initial velocity ( @xmath60 ) of the black hole , we consider situations in which the emission from it would be observed easily . that is , the luminosity of the black hole would be large , and the observable time would be long .",
    "we consider five combinations of @xmath32 and @xmath60 shown in table  [ tab : par ] .",
    "if we take larger @xmath32 and/or smaller @xmath60 , the dynamical friction becomes more effective and the black hole quickly falls into the galaxy center . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take smaller @xmath32 and/or larger @xmath60 , the luminosity of the black hole becomes too small to be observed ( equation  [ [ eq : dotm ] ] ) .",
    "moreover , the black hole is not bound to the galaxy , if @xmath60 is too large .",
    "the dynamical friction is most effective when @xmath61 . in table",
    "[ tab : par ] , we show the time - average of the time - scale , @xmath62 , for @xmath63 and @xmath61 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] shows the orbit of the black hole when @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : lum ] shows the luminosity of the same black hole ( @xmath66 ) . in table",
    "[ tab : par ] , we present the distance of the apastrons from the center of the galaxy ( @xmath67 ) when @xmath61 .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath67 is not much dependent on @xmath68 for a given @xmath60 .",
    "we also present the maximum x - ray luminosity of the black hole ( @xmath69 ) when @xmath61 in table  [ tab : par ] . for a given @xmath32 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is larger when @xmath68 is closer to @xmath52 , because the orbit is included in the galactic disk , where @xmath70 is large .",
    "we found that for @xmath71 , the luminosity reaches its maximum when the black hole passes apastrons and when the apastrons reside in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "this is because @xmath72 decreases , @xmath70 increases , and thus @xmath73 increases there ( equation  [ [ eq : dotm ] ] ) . on the other hand , for @xmath74 ,",
    "the distance of the apastrons from the galactic center ( @xmath67 ) is always large ( table  [ tab : par ] ) .",
    "thus , even if apastrons reside in the disk , @xmath70 is small there .",
    "therefore , the luminosity of the black hole reaches its maximum between the apastron and periastron , and @xmath69 is smaller compared with the models of @xmath71 ( table  [ tab : par ] ) .    assuming that black holes are ejected in random directions at the centers of galaxies",
    ", we estimate the probability of observing black holes with luminosities larger than a threshold luminosity @xmath75 . for given @xmath32 and @xmath60",
    ", we calculate 91 evolutions of the luminosity by changing @xmath68 from @xmath76 to @xmath52 by one degree .",
    "then , we obtain the period during which the relation @xmath77 is satisfied for each @xmath68 , and divide the period by @xmath78 .",
    "this is the fraction of the period during which the black hole luminosity becomes larger than @xmath79 .",
    "we refer to this fraction as @xmath80 and show it in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftheta ] when @xmath81 , @xmath64 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we average @xmath80 by @xmath68 , weighting with @xmath83 , and obtain the probability of observing black holes with @xmath84 . in table",
    "[ tab : par ] , we present the probability @xmath85 when @xmath86 ; for the parameters we chose , @xmath870.56 .",
    "we have found that a supermassive back hole that had been recoiled at the center of a disk galaxy could be observed in the galactic disk with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath88 .",
    "one of the candidates of such objects is ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) observed in disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are found in off - nuclear regions of nearby galaxies and their x - ray luminosities exceed @xmath89 , which are larger than the eddington luminosity of a black hole with a mass of @xmath90 .",
    "if ulxs are stellar mass black holes , they might be explained by anisotropic emission @xcite , slim - disks @xcite or thin , super - eddington accretion disks @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is some evidence that they are imbhs at least for some of them @xcite .",
    "considering their x - ray luminosities and off - center positions , some of the ulxs might be the recoiled supermassive black holes .",
    "however , the fraction of supermassive black holes in the ulxs would not be large .",
    "@xcite estimated that for comparable mass binaries with dimensionless spin values of 0.9 , only @xmath91% of all mergers are expected to result in an ejection speed of @xmath92@xmath93 .",
    "since the ejection speed is smaller for mergers with large mass ratios and smaller spin values , the actual fraction would be smaller .",
    "moreover , in our model , the time - corrected probability of observing black holes with @xmath94 is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is obtained by averaging @xmath97 f(\\theta)/t_{\\rm age}$ ] by @xmath68 , weighting with @xmath83 , and @xmath98 ( @xmath91  gyr ) is the age of a galaxy ( table  [ tab : par ] ) . here",
    ", we note that @xmath99 should be regarded as the upper - limit of the actual time - scale , because @xmath100 should decrease through the dynamical friction every time the black hole passes the dense region of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , our model indicates that a traveling supermassive black hole needs to have a mass comparable to the one currently observed at the galactic center in order to have large @xmath101 .",
    "it is unlikely that a galaxy would have undergone many mergers of black holes with such masses .",
    "the number of such mergers that a galaxy has undergone would be @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the probability that a galaxy has a traveling supermassive black hole with a luminosity comparable to that of ulxs is @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , current radio observations seem to show that ulxs observed so far are not supermassive black holes .",
    "our model predicts that the x - ray luminosity of a supermassive black hole traveling through the galaxy is comparable to the typical x - ray luminosity of a liner ( @xmath104@xmath105 ; * ? ? ?",
    "liners seem to show core radio emission and many even have detectable jets @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "radio observations have shown that no ulx has been detected with a unresolved radio core @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the optical luminosities of ulxs tend to be smaller than their x - ray luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is inconsistent with typical riaf spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is unlikely that most of the ulxs are the supermassive black holes traveling through the galaxies .",
    "however , the recoiled supermassive black holes could be found through future extensive surveys .",
    "our model predicts that the x - ray luminous black holes should not be observed far from the centers of the host galaxies ( say @xmath106  kpc ) , because @xmath70 should be small there (   [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "our model also predicts that the relative velocity between the x - ray source and the surrounding ism and stars is @xmath107 .",
    "if atomic line emission associated with the x - ray source is observed , the velocity could be estimated through the doppler shift . instead of x - rays , @xcite argued that radio detections may be best to search for isolated accreting black holes .",
    "the detailed analysis of the spectra and the time variability would be useful to determine the masses of the black holes @xcite . in the future , statistical studies could observationally constrain the probability of the mergers of black holes and the recoil .",
    "we have shown that a supermassive black hole ejected from the center of the host disk galaxy will return to the galactic disk , if the initial velocity is smaller than the escape velocity of the galaxy .",
    "the black hole accretes the surrounding ism and the resultant x - ray luminosity can reach @xmath108 , when it passes the apastrons in the disk .",
    "although the luminosity of a recoiled supermassive black hole is comparable to that of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , it is unlikely that many of the observed ulxs are the supermassive black holes .",
