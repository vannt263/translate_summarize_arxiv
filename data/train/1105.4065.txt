    "much of the previous research on three - dimensional simulations of exoplanetary atmospheric circulation has focused on the atmospheric dynamics ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while others @xcite have developed sophisticated schemes which combine dynamics with multi - band radiative transfer . despite making progress , our understanding of atmospheric circulation on extrasolar planets ( or  exoplanets \" )",
    "remains incomplete . to move forward",
    ", we need to construct a hierarchy of three - dimensional simulations of varying sophistication , so as to elucidate the isolated effects of various pieces of physics as well as the complex interplay between them @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to bridge the gap between these two bodies of work by elucidating the details of a computational setup of intermediate sophistication , so as to serve as a foundation for future work .",
    "our work may be partially regarded as the three - dimensional generalizations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    as natural extensions to purely dynamical simulation work",
    ", the effects of radiative transfer and convection need to be considered . as a first step in adding radiative transfer",
    ", we simplify the treatment by assuming that most of the stellar emission peaks at a wavelength which is shorter than and distinct from that at which the exoplanet re - radiates the absorbed heat @xcite .",
    "for example , the sun - like host star of an exoplanet has an emission spectrum which peaks in the optical , since @xmath0 using wien s law , where @xmath1 is the effective temperature of the star . for m stars ( red dwarfs ) ,",
    "the stellar spectrum instead peaks at @xmath2 .",
    "the equilibrium or effective temperature of the exoplanet is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the stellar radius and @xmath5 denotes the spatial separation between the star and the exoplanet . as the stellar photons travel downward into the atmosphere , they are eventually absorbed and re - emitted .",
    "the emission spectrum of an exoplanet is expected to peak in the infrared , since @xmath6 thus , to a first approximation one can regard the star as emitting  shortwave \" radiation onto the exoplanet , which then re - emits in the infrared (  longwave \" ) .",
    "the conversion of a shortwave photon into multiple longwave photons serves to increase entropy .",
    "our treatment of the radiative transfer then requires the specification of the shortwave ( @xmath7 ) and longwave ( @xmath8 ) optical depths , as well as the flux associated with stellar irradiation ( @xmath9 ) . also as a first step , we mimic convection by adjusting unstable atmospheric lapse rates to the stable dry adiabat @xcite .",
    "the key advantages of our simpler setup , compared to simulations with multi - band radiative transfer , are that it allows for a more efficient sampling of parameter space and clean comparisons to analytical models .",
    "in  [ sect : fms ] , we describe our computational setup , including our schemes for stellar irradiation , shortwave / longwave absorption , radiative transfer and convection .",
    "prior to simulating the atmospheric circulation on hot jupiters , we test our computational setup using earth - like models (  [ sect : earthlike ] ) . in  [ sect : hj ] , we describe our method for simulating hot jovian atmospheres  including an analytical formalism for calculating temperature - pressure profiles which includes the effect of collision - induced absorption  and examine results from several models based on the values of parameters appropriate to hd 209458b .",
    "the implications of our results , as well as a concise summary of the present study , are discussed in  [ sect : discussion ] .",

    "in this section , we describe our computational setup , which is based on the ` lima ` release of the ` fms ` , developed by the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory ( gfdl ) at princeton university @xcite . as the ` fms ` is set up to work in mks ( metres , kilogrammes and seconds ) units , most of the discussion will follow suit . unless specified otherwise , the term  day \" refers to an earth day ( exactly 86400 s ) .",
    "we implement the spectral dynamical core , which solves the three - dimensional primitive equations of meteorology  these equations assume hydrostatic equilibrium and other consistent approximations such as a small aspect ratio for the atmosphere ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite originally proposed the comparison of purely dynamical simulations with simplified thermal forcing and performed via different methods of solutions , known as the  held - suarez benchmark \" for earth .",
    "@xcite extended the held - suarez benchmark to tidally - locked exoplanets by examining three additional cases : a hypothetical exo - earth , a shallow model for hot jupiters and a deep model of hd 209458b .",
    "the spectral and finite difference ( b - grid ) dynamical cores of the ` fms ` were both subjected to these tests . in the case of the deep model of hd 209458b , the predictions for the wind speeds are found to depend upon the chosen magnitude of the hyperviscosity , although the qualitative features of the simulated wind and temperature maps remain largely invariant .    within the spectral dynamical core , the ( linear ) fluid dynamical quantities",
    "are expressed as a truncated sum @xmath13 of spherical harmonics  the larger the value of @xmath13 , the higher the horizontal resolution . the fiducial resolution we will adopt in the present study",
    "is t63l@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , which corresponds to a horizontal grid of 192 by 96 points in longitude versus latitude .",

    "the reference pressure is usually set to @xmath22 bar = @xmath23 pa = @xmath24 dyn @xmath25 .",
    "numerical noise accumulates at the grid scale and has to be damped via a  hyperviscous \" term with a damping order of @xmath26 , such that the operator @xmath27 acts on the relative vorticity ( see  3.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the pragmatic aim is to apply horizontal dissipation on a time scale @xmath28 that is a small fraction of an exoplanetary day .",
    "for example , in the held - suarez benchmark for earth , the adopted time scale is @xmath29 earth day . for our hot jupiter simulations ,",
    "we use @xmath30 hd 209458b day , consistent with the value used in @xcite ; this is also , to within an order of magnitude , the highest value needed .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the application of hyperviscosity and the specification of @xmath28 is unsupported by any fundamental theory  horizontal dissipation is solely a numerical tool meant to prevent a simulation from failing due to spectral blocking .    as in @xcite ,",
    "the simulations are started from an initial state of windless isothermality with @xmath31 denoting the initial temperature , in contrast to using initial temperature - pressure profiles obtained from one - dimensional radiative - convective calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the possible dependence of our results on more exotic initial conditions @xcite is deferred to a future study .",
    "there is an initialization period for each simulation which we disregard , during which the temperatures and velocities , averaged over the entire ( exo)planet , are decreasing / increasing from some initial values to their quasi - steady values . for earth - like simulations",
    ", we find the initialization period to be 200 days . for hot jupiters , a longer initialization period of 500 days",
    "is needed .",
    "after quasi - equilibrium is attained , we execute the simulations for a further 1000 days and temporally average the ouput .",
    "minor asymmetries in the physical quantities between the northern and southern hemispheres are artifacts of averaging over a finite period of time ( i.e. , in this case , 1000 days ) .      at the top of the atmosphere ,",
    "stellar irradiation is specified via the function , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the stellar irradiation constant , . ]",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the stefan - boltzmann constant and the dimensionless stellar irradiation function @xmath36 is in general a function of both the latitude @xmath37 and the longitude @xmath38 . since hot jupiters orbit at distances",
    "@xmath39 from their host stars , we have @xmath40 w m@xmath41 for @xmath42 . by contrast",
    ", we have @xmath43 w m@xmath41 for jupiter , which is a factor @xmath44 less than for hot jupiters . in the case of hd 209458b",
    ", we use the values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 measured or inferred by @xcite and @xcite to obtain the value shown in equation ( [ eq : stellar_constant ] ) ; we note that @xmath45 .",
    "in general , the influence of the stellar irradiation on a ( exo)planet and its dependence on geometry ( through @xmath46 ) is known as the  thermal forcing \" .",
    "the shortwave optical depth @xmath7 determines how the stellar irradiation is absorbed as it travels downward into the atmosphere @xcite , @xmath47 specifying the power law index as @xmath48 is equivalent to having a uniformly mixed shortwave absorber , since @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the shortwave opacity and @xmath51 is the surface gravity .",
    "when @xmath50 is constant , we have @xmath52 . when @xmath53 , the shortwave absorber is less well - mixed and resides _ lower _ down in the atmosphere .",
    "the received flux as a function of vertical pressure is then @xmath54    finally , we note that it is possible to specify a mean ( exo)planetary albedo , but this only serves to diminish the value of @xmath55 . as such , one only needs to explore the effects of varying the stellar irradiation constant .",
    "the radiative transfer scheme is based on the two - stream approximation @xcite , which assumes that the radiation can be separated into longwave , upward- ( @xmath56 ) and downward - propagating ( @xmath57 ) fluxes ( see  4.2 of @xcite ) , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the blackbody flux . at the bottom of the simulated atmosphere ,",
    "the longwave boundary condition is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the surface temperature ; at the top , it is @xmath62 .",
    "the newtonian relaxation term in the temperature equation is replaced by a radiative source term @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure , @xmath65 is the mass density and @xmath66 is the vertical coordinate .",
    "the shortwave , upward - propagating flux is assumed to be zero , i.e. , @xmath67 . furthermore",
    ", substituting the newtonian relaxation scheme for the dual - band radiative transfer scheme alleviates the need to rely on one - dimensional radiative - convective models ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) for calculations of the equilibrium temperature - pressure profile , thereby allowing self - consistency to be achieved . from the perspective of equation ( [ eq : rt ] ) alone",
    ", the radiative transfer scheme is strictly speaking grey ( as already noted by @xcite )  the shortwave , downward - propagating flux is merely diluted on its way down into the atmosphere via equation ( [ eq : flux_s ] )  but we term it  dual - band \" to emphasize the dual - wavelength nature of our treatment .",
    "the effects of scattering are neglected .",
    "the bottom of the atmosphere ( or the  surface \" ) is an idealized slab with a specifiable heat capacity , described by a single temperature @xmath61 governed by the equation , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the ( areal ) heat capacity of the slab .",
    "horizontal transport of fluid within the slab is not modelled . in the ( terrestrial ) atmospheric sciences literature , this idealized slab mimics the  mixed layer ocean \" , which is the @xmath70 m - thick layer of ocean intermediate between the atmosphere and the deep ocean , characterized by rigorous mixing induced by wave motion and turbulence . for simplicity , we do not implement an internal heat flux , typically parametrized by the equivalent blackbody temperature @xmath71 .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite use @xmath72 k in their models of hd 209458b , while @xcite adopt 5.7 w m@xmath41 as the internal heat flux in their simulation of jupiter ( which is equivalent to @xmath73 k ) .",
    "as the radiation is absorbed and re - emitted , the ( infrared ) photons encounter a longwave optical depth near the surface , described by @xmath74 where the longwave optical depths at the equator and the poles are given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "as already noted by @xcite , equation ( [ eq : tau_l0 ] ) ignores the longitudinal dependence of @xmath77 introduced by water vapour feedback and is thus inadequate for treating tidally locked , earth - like aquaplanets . throughout the vertical extent of the atmosphere ,",
    "the longwave optical depth is a linear combination of well - mixed and segregated atmospheric absorbers , @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 generally depend on geometry ( i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) as well as atmospheric chemistry .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ eq : tau_lw ] ) represents species of absorbers where the associated pressure scale height is @xmath81 that of the well - mixed species .",
    "for example , the linear term may represent well - mixed species like carbon dioxide , while setting @xmath82 approximates the structure of water vapour in the terrestrial atmosphere @xcite .",
    "as another example , setting @xmath83 approximates the process of collision - induced absorption @xcite within the atmospheres of the giant planets in our solar system @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we use @xmath84 with @xmath85 being a dimensionless parameter that controls the strength of the well - mixed longwave absorber .    in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a key assumption is that the ( water ) moisture content does not affect radiative transfer , such that the dynamical effects of the latent heat release associated with the condensation of water vapour can be isolated from its radiative effects .",
    "@xcite improved upon this treatment by allowing the optical depth associated with water vapour ( @xmath86 ) to depend on the instantaneous column density , thereby providing a simple treatment of water vapour feedback .",
    "since we are concerned only with dry atmospheres in the present study , we will ignore this issue .      in simulations of atmospheric circulation",
    ", convection is typically mimicked using simplified parametrizations known as  convective adjustment \" schemes ( e.g. , @xcite ;  3.6.9 of @xcite ) . for a dry atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the change in temperature of a parcel of atmosphere resulting from vertical motion is ( e.g. ,  2.7.2 of @xcite ) ) may be generalized to describe an atmosphere containing moisture and with a corresponding moist adiabatic lapse rate . ]",
    "@xmath87 where the lapse rate is defined as @xmath88 with @xmath66 being the vertical spatial coordinate , and the dry adiabatic lapse rate is @xmath89 , which has a value of about 9.8 k km@xmath90 for the terrestrial atmosphere .",
    "the potential temperature , @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the ideal gas constant , is the temperature a parcel of atmosphere would have if it was compressed or expanded adiabatically from the pressure @xmath18 to the reference pressure @xmath20 at the bottom of the simulation domain .",
    "the adiabatic coefficient @xmath12 is related to the number of degrees of freedom of the atmospheric gas @xmath94 : @xmath95 ( see  2.3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "for example , molecular hydrogen is experimentally found to have @xmath96 , close to the theoretical value for a diatomic gas ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the atmosphere is unstable if @xmath98 ( i.e. , super - adiabatic lapse rates ) .",
    "when the lapse rate is adjusted to a state of stability  subjected to the constraint of total energy conservation  convective adjustment is said to be performed .",
    "in other words , the tendency of convection is to minimize the magnitude of the potential temperature gradient @xmath99 and convective adjustment is an approximate way to mimic this process @xcite .    within the ` fms",
    "` , the dry convective adjustment scheme follows the prescription of @xcite . at a given time , the temperature difference @xmath100 resulting from departures from the adiabatic lapse rate is computed , @xmath101 where the integral is taken over the vertical extent of the unstable , model atmosphere layer .",
    "an implicit assumption made is that when the lapse rate of a layer is super - adiabatic , convection is rigorous enough to maintain a neutral lapse rate of potential temperature .",
    "the kinetic energy created by convection is then dissipated and instantly converted into heat , such that the total potential energy is invariant to convective adjustment . within each model layer ,",
    "the temperature is then adjusted by @xmath100 .",
    "it is worth noting that there exists a body of work on moist convective adjustment schemes , largely motivated by the pioneering work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who proposed the convective adjustment to reference temperature and humidity profiles instead of @xmath102 .",

    "it can be thought of as enforcing a  no slip \" boundary condition , such that large velocity gradients  and hence shears  exist across a small vertical height , which induces turbulent mixing ( e.g. ,  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary layer may become convectively unstable , which induces mixing .",
    "the end result is the same : eddies are produced which are smaller in size than those resulting from large - scale rotational flows , are typically unresolved in global simulations of atmospheric circulation and thus need to be accounted for using sub - grid models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in other words , turbulence within the boundary layer may be driven mechanically or via buoyancy .",
    "the eddies tend to have comparable horizontal and vertical length scales  i.e. , they are effectively three - dimensional  and are responsible for heat and momentum exchanges between the atmosphere and the surface .",

    "it is worth noting that the presence of vertical motions due to atmospheric circulation does not violate the assumption of hydrostatic balance provided the vertical accelerations are small compared to the acceleration due to gravity ( see  2.5 of @xcite ) .    in figures [ fig : tidal_earth2 ] , [ fig :",

    "a key difference between the held - suarez model and our dry earth - like model is that the radiative equilibrium of the latter is strongly unstable to convection .",
    "preliminary simulations without the boundary layer scheme (  [ subsect : boundary ] ) implemented fail , suggesting that models in which the surface is located within the active  as opposed to inert  part of the atmosphere require a scheme to establish heat and momentum equilibrium between the atmosphere and the surface .",
    "this expectation is borne out in our hot jupiter simulations (  [ sect : hj ] )  where the surface is located at @xmath122 bar , well into the inert part of the atmosphere  which do not require the boundary layer scheme to run to completion .",
    "we therefore include the boundary layer schemes only in our earth - like models .    in figure",
    "[ fig : earth_hs ] , we show the temporally- and zonally - averaged profiles of zonal wind and temperature as functions of the vertical pressure @xmath18 and the latitude @xmath37 , which we term the  held - suarez mean flow quantities \" @xcite . for comparison ,",

    "are clearly evident .",
    "there are quantitative differences between each of the temperature profiles , but the general trends are that the temperature decreases away from the equator and also with increasing altitude",
    ".    more insight on the convective stability of the model atmospheres may be gleaned by examining the temporally- and zonally - averaged potential temperature profiles , as shown in figure [ fig : earth_hs2 ] .",
    "the potential temperature may be regarded as the  height - adjusted \" temperature (  iii of @xcite ) .",
    "if it monotonically increases with height and does not depend on latitude , its structure is termed  barotropic \" . in this case , no convection occurs .",
    "if there is a gradient in the potential temperature across latitude , then its structure is said to be  baroclinic \" . in such situations , horizontal or  slanted \" convective motions occur . tapping into the available potential energy of the atmosphere @xcite",
    ", the baroclinic eddies resulting from these motions are responsible for transporting sensible heat from the equator to the poles @xcite .",
    "the stratosphere and troposphere are thus regions of the atmosphere where the potential temperature structure is ( largely ) barotropic and baroclinic , respectively , at least within the temporally- and zonally - averaged context of our models . in reality , the terrestrial stratosphere is not strictly barotropic  along isobars , there are distinctly non - zero variations of temperature with latitude which are dynamically important .",
    "the height or vertical pressure at which the troposphere transitions into the stratosphere is the tropopause ( e.g. , see figure 4 of @xcite ) , located at @xmath124 bar near the equator ( the tropics ) and @xmath1230.4 bar otherwise ( the temperate and polar regions ) .",
    "the middle row of figure [ fig : earth_hs2 ] shows the simulation with radiative transfer but without convective adjustment . unlike in the held - suarez benchmark , the existence of a surface with a finite heat capacity ( see  [ subsect : rt ] ) and its heating by solar irradiation ( see  [ subsect : irradiation ] ) results in convectively unstable vertical columns , thus necessitating the treatment of convection .",
    "the bottom row of figure [ fig : earth_hs2 ] demonstrates how the dry convective adjustment scheme ( see  [ subsect : convection ] ) brings the model atmosphere to convective stability in the vertical direction , while preserving the baroclinic instabilities ( i.e. , horizontal convection ) produced in the simulation .",
    "essentially , the role of convective adjustment is to straighten the isentropes such that they are vertically stable .",
    "atmospheric circulation of the terrestrial atmosphere can be generally regarded as having a three - cell structure ( e.g. , @xcite ;  2.1.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the hadley and polar cells , located near the equator and poles , respectively , are _ direct _ circulation cells because they are driven by heating and cooling patterns of the earth s surface .",
    "both cells are characterized by rising air in their warmer branches . by contrast , the mid - latitudinal ferrel cells are indirect because they are driven by the presence of baroclinic eddies ; cooler air is forced to rise .",
    "the presence of these cells may be revealed by examining the eulerian mean streamfunction @xmath125 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as defined in equation ( [ eq : streamfunction ] ) .",
    "the held - suarez benchmark , which mimics heating and cooling patterns by forcing the temperature field to relax to an ad hoc  equilibrium temperature \" profile on a specified  cooling \" time scale , manages to produce the hadley , ferrel and polar circulation cells , although the circulation associated with the ferrel cells is too strong by a factor of two ( top right panel of figure [ fig : earth_hs2 ] ) .",
    "as observed on earth , the polar cells are relatively weak with @xmath125 having values about an order of magnitude lower than for the other two cells .",
    "the simulations with dual - band radiation ( middle right and bottom right panels of figure [ fig : earth_hs2 ] ) manage to only produce the hadley and ferrel cells ; there is a pair of cells near the poles , but they reside only at low altitudes ( @xmath1261 bar ) .",
    "the absence of the polar cells in our simulations and also those of @xcite is unsurprising since the details concerning the polar temperatures ( e.g. , sea ice , the presence of antarctica ) are not modelled .",
    "the hadley cell is significantly too strong in the dual - band simulation due to the near - neutral convective stability in the tropics , while the ferrel cell is confined to only high altitudes due to the presence of convective momentum fluxes in the lower troposphere ( see @xcite for more details )  these issues are ameliorated in simulations with moisture .",
    "figure [ fig : tp_earth ] shows the globally - averaged temperature - pressure profiles for the trio of simulations . by construction , the held - suarez benchmark does not produce the temperature inversion empirically observed in the stratosphere , since the stratospheric temperature is set to be constant in this model .",
    "there are slight differences between the @xmath127-@xmath18 profiles for the simulations with and without convective adjustment , where the latter model produces a small temperature inversion in the stratosphere .",
    "our dry model neglects the fact that the terrestrial tropospheric temperature profile is strongly influenced by latent heat release from the condensation of water vapour . in the tropics ,",
    "the temperatures are approximately moist adiabatic @xcite , while in the extratropics they are determined by a coupling between latent heat release and baroclinic eddies ( e.g. , @xcite ) with additional contributions from the land - sea contrast . on average",

    "as demonstrated by @xcite using a hierarchy of analytical models and simulations , there is downward transport of eddy momentum at the equators of hot jovian atmospheres , which causes counter - rotating , equatorial flow .",

    "since there are virtually no empirical constraints on the zonal wind profiles of hot jupiters , unlike for the giant planets in our solar system , we do not adopt the approach of @xcite .",
    "secondly , the bottom of the simulation domain (  [ subsect : rt ] ) does not lend itself to easy physical interpretation , unlike in the earth - like cases where it mimics the mixed layer ocean . a plausible approach",
    "is to demand that the radiative time scale @xcite , @xmath142 is continuous at the bottom . at and beneath the bottom of the simulation domain",
    ", the hot jupiter has a finite thermal inertia if the heat capacity is non - zero ( @xmath143 j k@xmath90 m@xmath41 )  both longwave and intrinsic heat are not instantaneously ( re-)emitted . the thermal inertia time scale is @xmath144 where the thermal inertia is defined as ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath145 with @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 being the thermal conductivity , mass density and specific heat capacity at constant pressure associated with the bottom , respectively .",

    "furthermore , @xmath147 may be eliminated in favour of @xmath18 and @xmath127 via the ideal gas law ( e.g. ,  2.3.1 of @xcite ) , @xmath153 where the specific gas constant is @xmath154 , @xmath155 j k@xmath90 kg@xmath90 is the universal gas constant and @xmath156 is the mean molecular weight of the atmospheric molecules . the specific gas constant may be related to more familiar quantities via @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath159 is the mean mass of the atmospheric molecules and @xmath160 denotes the mass of a hydrogen atom .",

    "there are two main pieces of key physics which need to be included within the atmospheric boundary layer .",
    "firstly , the turbulence generated within the layer acts as a form of drag between the surface and the atmosphere . secondly ,",
    "since the turbulent eddies generated are expected to be three - dimensional , energy flows towards the smallest length scales ( i.e. , a forward kolmogorov cascade ) where it is dissipated by molecular viscosity .",
    "the process of turbulent mixing may be described by the diffusion equation .",
    "therefore , a boundary layer scheme needs to approximately capture the effects of drag and diffusion .",
    "operationally , drag between the surface and the lowest model layer is expressed in the form of drag coefficients acting on the temperature and velocity fields , which are calculated using the  monin - obukhov \" drag laws , considered standard in the atmospheric science community ( see  2c of @xcite ) : @xmath313 where @xmath314 and @xmath315 is the height of the lowest model layer .",
    "it should be noted that equation ( [ eq : dragcoeff ] ) is considered a simplified monin - obukhov formulation  more sophisticated functions exist to describe @xmath316 .",
    "the key physics is captured in three numbers : @xmath106 , @xmath317 and @xmath108 .",
    "the first of these is the roughness length @xmath106 , which parametrizes the macroscopic effects of the surface type on the drag . within the monin - obukhov framework , it is the vertical height at which the horizontal winds go to zero .",
    "for example , it is @xmath318 m over open water and @xmath237 m over urban terrain .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath319 m for our baseline earth - like model (  [ subsect : earth ] ) .    denoting the horizontal wind speed by @xmath320 ,",
    "the second of these numbers is the bulk richardson number ( e.g. , ",
    "3.7.1 of @xcite ) , @xmath321 which quantifies the effects of shear versus vertical stability .",
    "when the bulk richardson number falls below a critical value @xmath32210 , the atmosphere is turbulent . above this critical value ,",
    "the drag coefficients are set to zero .",
    "again following @xcite , we set @xmath323 for our earth - like model . in equation ( [ eq : dragcoeff ] ) , the quantity @xmath324 is the bulk richardson number evaluated at the lowest model layer .",
    "the third of these numbers is the von krmn constant , which from laboratory experiments and terrestrial atmospheric observations is estimated to be @xmath325 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath326 in our earth - like simulations .    to treat turbulent diffusion , we first determine the boundary layer depth @xmath327 by calculating the height where @xmath328 @xcite .",
    "the turbulent diffusion coefficient is computed as @xcite @xmath329 where @xmath330 the boundary layer fraction @xmath109 defines a  surface layer \" of height @xmath331 which is assumed to be in heat and momentum equilibrium with the surface  this formulation is made in the interest of computational efficiency , so as to avoid an iterative calculation to establish equilibrium .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath332 . above the surface layer",
    ", the diffusion coefficient smoothly goes to zero at the top of the boundary layer ( @xmath333 ) . the surface layer diffusion coefficient is @xmath334^{-1 } , & { \\cal r}_{i_0 } > 0 , \\\\ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath335 represents the horizontal velocity in the lowest model layer .",
    "the diffusion coefficients act on the velocity field and the dry static ( specific ) energy , the later of which is defined as @xmath336    the monin - obukhov framework describes mixing induced via both shear and convection , and allows for a smooth transition between the two regimes . a key difference between it and the convective adjustment scheme (  [ subsect : convection ] )",
    "is that the former mixes momentum while the latter does not .",
    "an obstacle to applying the monin - obukhov scheme to the atmospheres of hot jupiters is that the four parameters are considered to be free ."
