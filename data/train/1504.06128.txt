    "observations suggest that the inner regions of relatively massive disc galaxies contain the oldest stars , and that their scalelengths increase with time ( e.g. de jong 1996 ) .",
    "such galaxies are thought to complete central star formation early , while their outer regions continue to grow as gas at large radii is converted into stars .",
    "although this phenomenon has been known for two decades , it is now generally termed _",
    "`` inside - out '' _ growth ( e.g. , macarthur et al . 2004 ; williams et al . 2009 ;",

    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; @xmath8  m@xmath9 ; kim et al .",
    "1998 ; van der marel 2004 ) - perhaps the best studied example - exhibits young stars that are found to be more centrally concentrated than older stars ( e.g. meschin et al . 2014 ) .",
    "however , this may be in part due to its close proximity to the milky way , where interaction may act to shrink the star forming hi gas disc over time ( nidever 2014 ) . the intermediate - mass triangulum galaxy ( m33 ; @xmath10  m@xmath9 ; corbelli 2003 ) appears to be an admixture of these two mass regimes ( e.g. , barker et al . 2007 ; williams et al . 2013 ;",
    "robles - valdez et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the inner disc may form inside - out , and the outer ( beyond the truncation radius ) disc may form `` outside - in '' . due to this dual nature , understanding intermediate - mass discs is of key importance for building a comprehensive understanding of disc formation ( e.g. see gogarten et al .",
    "2010 for the case of ngc  300 )",
    ".    from the point of view of stellar population studies , important observational diagnostics of disc growth and evolution include the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) of the disc stellar population(s ) , their radial age gradients and metallicity gradients ( e.g. , freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ; macarthur et al .",
    "for example , one approach to understand disc formation is to study the radial metallicity gradients of disc stars and how these gradients evolve with time .",
    "the time evolution of metallicity gradients in discs is important because it is directly linked to disc growth : gradients encode the location and metallicity of gas accreted to the disc .",
    "the assumption that stars stay where they were born implicitly or explicitly form part of many chemical evolution models of galaxy discs ( e.g. tinsley et .",
    "al . 1974 ; matteucci & francois 1989 ; boissier & prantzos 1999 ) . however , rokar et al . ( 2008 ) have shown that subsequent dynamical evolution of disc stellar populations  such as radial mixing  may flatten out such gradients ( but see also grand , kawata & cropper 2013 ) .",
    "in addition , radial mixing tends to flatten and create spread in the disc amr ( rokar et al .",
    "2008 ; grand et al .",
    "the lesson here is that , as emphasised for example by schoenrich & binney ( 2009 ) , disc chemistry and disc kinematics can not be separated if a complete picture of disc formation is to be obtained ( a good example of this approach is the califa survey - see e.g. , snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in terms of kinematics ,",
    "an important time - dependent diagnostic of disc formation is the age - velocity dispersion relation . the velocity dispersion of disc stars in the milky way increases with age ( e.g. holmberg et al . 2007 ; soubiran et al .",
    "2008 ; aumer & binney 2009 ) and recent work suggest this is also the case in m31 ( dorman et al .",
    "the origin of these relations is still unclear , but might arise due to either disc heating processes ( e.g. spitzer & schwarzschild 1951 ; wielen 1977 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; minchev & quillen 2006 ; hnninen & flynn 2002 ; martig , minchev & flynn 2014 ) , or the different kinematical properties of gas at the time of star formation ( e.g. brook et al .",
    "2004 ; bournard , elmegreen & martig 2009 ; bird et al . 2013 ) , or some combination of the two mechanisms .",
    "observationally , one way of studying the time evolution of disc populations is to go to high redshift .",
    "for example , yuan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) studied the hii regions of a lensed disc galaxy at @xmath11 and found a negative metallicity gradient more than ten times steeper than nearby systems - suggestive that metallicity gradients may flatten over time .",
    "however , major difficulties in this approach are that at @xmath12 discs subtend only a few arcseconds . the information obtained from such studies",
    "is limited by the small spatial scales and faintness of these systems .",
    "an alternative approach is to study nearby discs in detail , and compare the properties obtained from stellar populations that trace different epochs of star formation .",
    "chemical abundances for massive ( ob ) stars are feasible for the nearest galaxies ( e.g. urbaneja et al .",
    "2005 ; esteban et al .",
    "2009 ) , while studies of more evolved populations have concentrated on bright emission lines from planetary nebula ( e.g. magrini et al . 2004 ) , or on rgb stars for the very nearest systems ( e.g. , kalirai et al . 2006",
    "; leaman et al . 2009 ; carrera et al 2011 ) .",
    "while extremely useful , these tracer populations generally represent stellar populations with a limited range of ( or poorly constrained ) ages .",
    "for example , ob stars have lifetimes of @xmath0myr and therefore reflect very recent star formation .",
    "in contrast pne and rgb stars can span a wide range of ages , but their precise ages are hard to constrain - particularly for the oldest populations .    in contrast , star clusters in late - type galaxies exhibit a wide range of ages , from very young , massive clusters up to gc ages , present the opportunity to study disc evolution and kinematics over the whole lifetime of the galaxy ( e.g. , huchra , brodie & kent 1991 ; chandar et al .",

    "we present the first results of a spectroscopic campaign to characterise the star cluster system of m33 .",
    "due to its mass and proximity , m33 presents an important laboratory for understanding the formation of disc galaxies , and addressing some of the above issues .",
    "m33 is an intermediate mass ( @xmath10  m@xmath9 ; corbelli 2003 ) disc system with a minimal bulge component ( e.g. regan & vogel 1994 ) . its proximity ( @xmath13  kpc ; galleti , bellazzini & ferraro 2004 ) and favourable inclination angle ( @xmath14 ; paturel et al .",

    "each wyffos / af2 fibre has 1.6 arcsecond diameter , similar to the size of the star clusters ( @xmath20 arcseconds ) , thereby minimizing any loss of light .",
    "few of these objects have previous velocity measurements .",
    "because the m33 disc provides a bright and variable background emission , estimations of the underlying galaxy light should be performed as locally as possible .",
    "for this reason , the observations were taken in a `` beam - switching '' mode , with three 15 minute off - source integrations ( offset from the objects by 10 arcseconds to the north , west and east ) interspersed within the 30 minute integrations on the clusters .",

    "we also compare the m33 cluster data with the total los velocity dispersions of solar neighbourhood stars ( holmberg et al .",
    "2007 ) and those of milky way open clusters ( ocs ) compiled by hayes & friel ( 2014 ) . in the case of the hayes & friel ( 2014 ) data , we have multiplied their velocity dispersions by a scalefactor of @xmath23 assuming isotropic velocity distributions .",
    "this is an estimate of the true scalefactor , since the hayes & friel ( 2014 ) velocities contain both components of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "however , the good agreement between the holmberg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and hayes & friel ( 2014 ) los dispersions for disc populations at a given age ( after applying our scalefactor ) suggests that this scaling is reasonable .",
    "it is evident that the m33 clusters in figure  [ disp_age ] show an increasing velocity dispersion with age .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that of the milky way ocs .",
    "this is also observed in milky way disc stars , where the youngest stars in the solar neighbourhood have velocity dispersions of @xmath010 km / s ( again assuming isotropic velocity ellipsoids ; aumer & binney 2009 ) , rising to @xmath26 km / s at 10 gyr ages ( e.g. , holmberg et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "a number of workers have interpreted the avr of the stellar disc with time as a result of disc heating processes ( e.g. spitzer & schwarzchild 1951 ; wielen 1977 ) .",
    "candidate mechanisms for this heating may be secular - such as stellar interactions with giant molecular clouds ( spitzer & schwarzchild 1951 - but see lacey ( 1984 ) ) and spiral arms ( minchev & quillen 2006 ) , or related to substructure infall including black holes from the galactic halo passing through the disc ( hnninen & flynn 2002 ) and the infall of satellites in the form of minor mergers within the context of the hierarchical clustering paradigm ( e.g. mihos & hernquist 1996 ; benson et al . 2004 ; villalobos & helmi 2008 ; house et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "an alternative ( and not mutually exclusive ) interpretation of the avr is that stars and star clusters of a given age may have been formed in gas with intrinsically different kinematical properties ( e.g. brook et al .",
    "2004 ; bournard , elmegreen & martig 2009 ; bird et al . 2013 ) .",
    "specifically , the average ( molecular ) gas velocity dispersion in discs may have been higher at early times ( e.g. , frster schreiber et al .",
    "2009 ; wisnioski et al . 2014 ) , thereby leading to stellar populations formed at these epochs with characteristically higher velocity dispersions . in some sense , this may be regarded as a `` cooling '' of the disc ism over time .",
    "both heating and cooling might be expected to occur in discs , but teasing out the relative importance of these processes is difficult with these data . indeed , even with full phase - space information and detailed chemical abundances this is a challenging task ( e.g. , bovy et al .",
    "however , the fact that we see similar avrs in both the milky way and m33 discs does place constraints on the underlying cause of this relation ( see also leaman et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "simulations that take into account both secular heating and merging processes make a fair job of reproducing the observations . in figure  [ disp_age ]",
    "we show the region of age - velocity dispersion space produced by the simulations of martig , minchev & flynn ( 2014 ) scalefactor , since martig et al .",
    "( 2014 ) provide @xmath27 not @xmath28 . ] .",
    "these authors re - simulated at high resolution 7 disc galaxies taken from cosmological simulations ( martig et al .",
    "2012 ) with a range of formation histories ( quiescent to 1:4 mergers ) and stellar masses ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "although the stellar mass of the m33 disc is ( @xmath30 ; corbelli 2003 ) , which is a factor of 10 less massive than martig et al s least massive galaxy , both the normalisation and trend of the simulations are broadly consistent with the m33 and milky way cluster data at all ages ( the simulations show a wide range in velocity dispersion since we have taken the minimum and maximum values of all 7 galaxies as the range in model predictions ) . in detail , the slope of the avr in the simulations is somewhat flatter than the observations . in addition ,",
    "the youngest milky way ocs have velocity dispersions that lie below the models .",
    "the latter discrepancy may reflect the resolution limits in the simulations resulting in stars being born too hot ( martig et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "although martig et al .",
    "( 2014 ) could not identify the exact mechanism(s ) responsible for disc heating in their simulations , they conclude that for quiescent systems disc heating produces a smoothly increasing velocity dispersion up to @xmath09 gyr .",
    "a general result is that stars older than this are born kinematically hot in turbulent gas at early times ( brook et al .",
    "2004 ; bournard , elmegreen & martig 2009 ; bird et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the m33 data seems consistent with the picture of a smoothly heated disc cluster population , perhaps with the oldest population formed in a kinematically hotter environment .",
    "however , the similarity between the avrs of the milky way ocs and the m33 clusters suggests that something other than just secular heating is controlling the overall shape of the avr .",
    "analytic models ( leaman et al . 2015 ) that account for both substructure heating and ism evolution as a function of host galaxy mass suggest that the ism defines a characteristic `` pressure floor '' , with additional heating via subtructure playing an increasingly important role for systems with masses similar to , or greater than , that of m33 .    finally , we highlight that comparisons between the avrs of stars and star clusters in a given disc should place constraints on heating processes within stellar discs .",
    "we expect that the efficiency of mechanisms that heat a population via scattering will be a function of the mass ratio of the scatterer and `` scatteree '' ( e.g. spitzer & schwarzchild 1951 ) . for example , in scenarios where stars and star clusters are heated via scattering off gmcs in the plane of the disc , we would expect stars of a given age and position in the disc to be more efficiently scattered than star clusters , yielding a higher line of sight velocity dispersion .",
    "we identify 12 clusters in our sample that have age , metallicity and kinematical properties consistent with globular clusters in m33 .",
    "six of these gcs in our sample ( r12 , r14 , m9 , u49 , h38 , u77 ) have @xmath31 cmds ( in f555w and f814w filters ) that extend to @xmath32 magnitudes below the horizontal branch ( sarajedini et al .",
    "the remaining six clusters we identify as good gc candidates , having radial velocities and stellar population properties consistent with this interpretation ( section  [ starclusteridentification ] ) .",
    "a number of previous studies have concluded that there may be a significant age spread amongst the m33 gcs based on integrated broadband photometry ( cohen , persson & searle 1984 ; cbfs02 ) , integrated spectra ( christian & schommer 1983 ; chandar et al . 2006 ) or arguments based on the horizontal branch morphology ( sarajedini et al .",

    "we find old ages for these three clusters ( @xmath33 gyr ) .",
    "given the uncertainties in the modelling of integrated stellar populations and the continued controversy over what drives the second parameter effect ( e.g. milone et al . 2014 ) we do not consider that our ages are in serious disagreement with the sarajedini et al .",

    "we indentify two further gc candidates with ages similar to u77 .",
    "cmds will be very valuable for investigating whether these are genuinely younger objects , or exhibit blue hbs .",
    "for example , chandar et al . ( 2006 ) conclude , based on mmt integrated spectra and @xmath31 photometry of the horizontal branch , that the m33 cluster c38 ( not in our sample ) has ages @xmath025 gyr .",

    "we find that all of these clusters are old with an age range between 9.5  12.4 gyr , this is consistent with the cbfs02 findings for r12 and r14 , but inconsistent with m9 , u49 and h38 .",
    "due to the difficulties of breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy with broadband colours , we prefer our age estimates over those of cbfs02 .    to summarise our age results , we find no compelling evidence , based on the present data , for a significant age spread in the gcs of m33 as claimed by previous authors .",

    "width=377 ]    figure  [ comp_met ] shows that the metallicities of the m33 gcs are quite metal - rich ( @xmath38[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath191.12@xmath400.09)[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath191.25@xmath400.14 ] .",
    "this metallicity is entirely consistent with the expected location of m33 ( @xmath41 ) on the `` zero - age '' luminosity  metallicity relation derived by ct , marzke & west ( 1998 ) .",
    "the mean m33 gc metallicities are also similar to the the mean metallicity of the m31 clusters ( @xmath38[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath191.00@xmath400.02 ) , but more metal - rich than the milky way ( @xmath38[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath191.27@xmath400.05 ) , and significantly more metal - rich than the lmc ( @xmath38[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath191.87@xmath400.08 ) and fornax dwarf spheroidal ( @xmath38[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath192.08@xmath400.17 ) cluster systems . restricting the milky way clusters to the metal - poor halo population ( @xmath38[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath191.53@xmath400.04 ) makes the apparent disparity with m33 more acute .",
    "a similar separation can not easily be performed for the m31 cluster system since the metallicity distribution of its cluster system is not clearly bimodal , although caldwell et al .",
    "( 2011 ) do identify a possible metal - poor peak at [ m / h]@xmath42 .",
    "we investigated further the differences between the milky way and m33 clusters by determining , via monte carlo simulation , the likelihood that the m33 gcs could be drawn from a parent population resembling the milky way halo clusters .",
    "we cut both samples at [ m / h ] < = -0.7 ( i.e. restricting ourselves to the halo clusters ) giving 11 m33 clusters and 118 milky way clusters .",
    "we then ran 10,000 trials where we randomly selected 11 clusters from the milky way distribution and calculated their mean metallicities .",
    "only 0.24 percent of these samples had mean metallicities equal to or greater than the mean of the m33 clusters .",
    "therefore , based solely on metallicity , the m33 clusters are unlikely to have been drawn from a parent population resembling the milky way halo clusters at @xmath43 per cent confidence .",
    "the high metallicity of the m33 gcs presents something of a problem if we wish to identify the majority of these objects solely with an accreted halo population ( e.g. searle & zinn 1978 ; ct , marzke & west 1998 ) .",
    "the mean metallicities of lmc and fornax clusters suggest that no combination of the gc systems of these ( present day ) galaxies could have contributed to the build up the metallicity distribution of m33 gcs in our present sample , save perhaps for the very metal - poor tail of the distribution .",
    "since fornax ( m@xmath44 ; mateo 1998 ) and the lmc ( m@xmath45  ) bracket the lower and higher mass ends of local group `` dwarfs '' with gc systems , this constrains the nature of the origin of the m33 gcs .    assuming a fornax dwarf or small magellanic cloud ( smc)-like field star amr , we can ask what age a gc accreted from such a galaxy need have in order to attain a metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath46 , the mean metallicity of the m33 gc system .",
    "the amr for the smc field stars suggests that an age of @xmath21 gyr or younger would be required to achieve the necessary enrichment levels ( dobbie et al .",
    "2004 ; carrera et al . 2008",
    "; leaman et al .",
    "such young ages for the gcs in our sample are generally ruled out based on our stellar population analysis and previous observations ( see below ) .",
    "this age constraint can be relaxed to @xmath33 gyr if we assume that a more massive , lmc - like system were accreted .",
    "however , given that the lmc stellar disc is similar in mass to the m33 stellar disc ( @xmath30  ) , such an equal - mass merger would likely disrupt the entire m33 disc .",
    "a system intermediate in mass between the smc and lmc could possibly accommodate both the metallicities and ages seen in the m33 gcs , but some fine - tuning would be required ( since the bulk on the inner m33 gc system would have to be built up of such systems ) .",
    "interestingly , the simulations of cooper et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggest that the typical satellite that went to form a _ milky way_-like halo had a mass similar to that of the brightest local group dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) ( e.g. fornax - like systems ) .",
    "however , differences observed between the stellar populations of halo stars and those seen in local group dsphs ( venn et al . 2004 ; helmi et al . 2006 ; fiorentino et al .",
    "2014 ) suggest that these systems played at most a minor role in building up the milky way halo .",
    "if the m33 clusters truly represent the remnants of an accreted population then these clusters must have come from systems more massive than presently observable dsphs .",
    "an alternative origin for some or all of these gcs is a formation during an early collapse phase , perhaps leading to the formation of a bulge or disc component ( e.g. brook et al .",
    "the question of whether or not m33 has a bulge remains controversial ( e.g. hodge 2012 ) .",
    "however , regan & vogel ( 1994 ) placed an upper limit on any putative bulge of m@xmath47 ( l@xmath48  ) . assuming a relatively generous @xmath49-band specific frequency of 1 ( harris et al . 1991 ) , this suggests that at most 3 gcs may be associated with this component .",
    "an alternative is to associate the gcs with the m33 disc .",
    "this association is not unreasonable ; our gc sample is confined to within @xmath16 kpc of the galaxy centre and are seen in projection against the optical disc ( figure  [ spatial_distribution ] ) .",
    "the inner ( @xmath6 kpc ) gcs show a hint of an exponential - like surface density profile and also a steep and negative radial gradient consistent with the evolution of the gradient seen for the younger disc clusters . as discussed above ,",
    "the m33 clusters in our sample are more metal - rich than milky way halo clusters , and also appear to be more metal - rich than expected for true halo clusters in m33 ( e.g. stonkut et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find [ m / h]@xmath50 for an extended star cluster lying 12.5 kpc in projection from the centre of m33 ) .",
    "in addition , the kinematics of the clusters are consistent with a continuous heating of the disc cluster population ( or a cooling of the ism from which they formed - see section  [ avr ] ) over the disc lifetime ( section  [ kinematics ] ) .",
    "finally , clues to the origin of the inner m33 gcs comes from analysis of their structural parameters .",
    "mackey & van den bergh ( 2005 ) have shown that the `` young halo '' ( yh ) gcs in the milky way tend to have larger half - light and tidal radii than the inner `` old halo '' ( oh ) clusters , which in turn are more extended than the more metal - rich bulge / disc ( bd ) globular clusters .",
    "ma ( 2015 ) has presented structural parameters for 10 m33 globular clusters ( from sarajedini et al .",
    "1998 ) , five of which are in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "all these clusters ( r12 , r14 , m9 , u49 and h39 ) appear quite compact for their luminosities , with mean half - light radii of @xmath51 pc ( king model ) and a maximum @xmath52 pc ( u49 ) .",
    "this is similar to the bd clusters in mackey & van den bergh ( 2005 ) which all have @xmath53 pc .",
    "the distribution of half - light radii for the oh and yh clusters extends to @xmath54 and 25 pc respectively .    similarly , the mean tidal radii of the m33 clusters is @xmath55 pc with r14 having the largest ( @xmath56 pc ) .",
    "the bd clusters in mackey & van den bergh ( 2005 ) all have @xmath57 pc , with mean radii of @xmath58 pc , consistent with the m33 sample .",
    "such small tidal radii are expected of clusters that spend a significant fraction of their time in a deep potential ( i.e. near the galaxy centre ) , suggesting that these are truly central clusters and not simply halo clusters seen in projection . by comparison ,",
    "the oh and yh gcs in the milky way have distributions of tidal radii that extend out to @xmath59 and 150 pc respectively .    to summarise , while our sample size is small , based on their stellar populations , spatial locations , kinematics and structural parameters",
    ", we suggest that the inner m33 gcs are better associated with the m33 disc rather than its halo kpc of the galaxy centre .",
    "the very distant clusters identified in wide - field surveys ( huxor et al .",
    "2009 , cockcroft et al .",
    "2011 ) are probably genuine halo clusters . in addition",
    ", there may well be a mix of halo and disc clusters in our sample . ] or minimal bulge .",
    "we have obtained precision velocities ( to @xmath33 km / s ) and stellar population parameters ( age , metallicity ) for a sample of 77 star clusters in m33 .",
    "our principal findings are :    * the m33 disc clusters show a clear age - metallicity relation in the sense that younger clusters are more metal - rich than the older clusters .",
    "the youngest clusters in our sample have @xmath010 myr ages and near solar metallicities , very similar to the m33 ob star populations . *",
    "we find evidence for evolution in the disc metallicity gradient in m33 .",
    "the metallicity gradient becomes less negative with time .",
    "the evolution in the the metallicity gradient is strong with @xmath60 dex / kpc / gyr .",
    "the inner globular clusters ( @xmath6 kpc ) show a steep , negative radial metallicity gradient . *",
    "we find little evidence for radial age gradients in the disc clusters .",
    "clusters have continued to form throughout the star forming disc ( within 6 kpc ) throughout the disc lifetime . * clusters younger than @xmath4",
    "gyr all exhibit rotation consistent with the disc of m33 .",
    "the rotation amplitude decreases and velocity dispersion increases with increasing cluster age . we find a smoothly increasing age - velocity dispersion relation very similar to that seen in the milky way open cluster system . we interpret this as a combination of secular heating processes and cooling of the ism with time .",
    "* we identify six new globular cluster candidates that have kinematics and stellar populations consistent with genuine globular clusters .",
    "follow - up high resolution imaging is required to unambiguously determine their nature .",
    "* we find no strong evidence for a significant age spread in the m33 globular clusters .",
    "the majority of globular clusters in our sample are old ( @xmath33 gyr ) .",
    "three clusters have spectroscopic ages of @xmath16  gyr",
    ". however , one of these is clearly older than this based on the presence of a well - developed blue hb in its @xmath31 cmd ( sarajedini et al .",
    "the remaining two clusters may be genuinely intermediate aged clusters in m33 . *",
    "the mean metallicity of the m33 globulars is relatively metal - rich ( @xmath38[m / h]@xmath39=@xmath191.12@xmath400.09 ) .",
    "this is significantly more metal - rich than the halo gcs in the milky way , and gcs in the lmc and the fornax dsph .",
    "based on their high metallicities , spatial distributions , kinematics and structural parameters we argue that the inner gcs are better associated with the m33 disc than halo .    we believe that this contribution reinforces the utility of star clusters in studying the disc components of galaxies . since clusters typically span a large range of ages , they can be used to probe disc properties over the whole disc lifetime , while at the same time consistent analysis methods can be applied .",
    "this contrasts with complementary approaches that use stellar population tracers that are confined to narrow age ranges ( e.g. ob stars ; urbaneja et al .",
    "2005 ) or age ranges that are not well constrained ( e.g. , pne ; magrini et al .",
    "2004 ; ciardullo et al 2004 ) and require instrinsically different analysis methods .    the stellar population analysis used here , consisting of full spectral fitting ( e.g. , koleva et al . 2009 ) to the latest generation of model seds ( vazdekis et al .",
    "2010 ) , is a powerful technique for estimating ages and metallicities of star clusters .",
    "however , it does have its limitations .",
    "most apparent is its lack of age resolution at old ages . given the uncertainties in stellar population modelling , particularly in understanding non - canonical hot populations and the incorporation of non - solar abundance ratios , our ability to differentiate age amongst the oldest populations is limited .",
    "this is most apparent in our discussion of the putative age - spread amongst the m33 globular clusters ( section  [ theglobularclusters ] ) .",
    "only deep cmds reaching to below the turnoff in these clusters will provide secure ages for these objects .",
    "future improvements to this work should include increasing the sample size and spectral range covered for the cluster populations .",
    "in particular , going to bluer wavelengths will give additional leverage in constraining the ages of the younger clusters .",
    "in addition , providing that the systematics are adequately characterised ( sakari et al .",
    "2014 ) , new techniques that obtain heavy- and light - element abundances via integrated spectroscopy ( e.g. mcwilliam & bernstein 2008 ; colucci et al . 2012 , 2013 ; larsen et al . 2012 ; sakari et al 2013 ) could usefully be applied to m33 star clusters and other nearby disc cluster systems .",

    "<S> we present precision radial velocities and stellar population parameters for 77 star clusters in the local group galaxy m33 . </S>",
    "<S> our gtc and wht observations sample both young , massive clusters and known / candidate globular clusters , spanning ages @xmath0 @xmath1 yr , and metallicities , [ m / h ] @xmath2 to solar . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster system exhibits an age - metallicity relation ; the youngest clusters are the most metal - rich . when compared to hi data , clusters with [ m / h]@xmath3 and younger than @xmath4 gyr </S>",
    "<S> are clearly identified as a disc population . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters show evidence for strong time evolution in the disc radial metallicity gradient ( d[m / h]dt / dr = @xmath5 dex / kpc / gyr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the oldest clusters have stronger , more negative gradients than the youngest clusters in m33 . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters also show a clear age - velocity dispersion relation . </S>",
    "<S> the line of sight velocity dispersions of the clusters increases with age similar to milky way open clusters and stars . </S>",
    "<S> the general shape of the relation is reproduced by disc heating simulations , and the similarity between the relations in m33 and the milky way suggests that heating by substructure , and cooling of the ism both play a role in shaping this relation . </S>",
    "<S> we identify 12 `` classical '' gcs , six of which are newly identified gc candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the gcs are more metal - rich than milky way halo clusters , and show weak rotation . the inner ( @xmath6 kpc ) gcs exhibit a steep radial metallicity gradient ( d[m / h]/dr = @xmath7 dex / kpc ) and an exponential - like surface density profile . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these inner gcs are thick disc rather than halo objects .    </S>",
