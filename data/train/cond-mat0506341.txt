    "we consider the problem of self - avoiding walks on the square lattice @xmath22 for walks on an infinite lattice , it is generally accepted @xcite that the number of such walks of length @xmath23 , equivalent up to a translation , denoted @xmath24 , grows as @xmath25 with metric properties , such as mean - square radius of gyration or mean - square end - to - end distance growing as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 the growth constant @xmath14 is lattice dependent , and for the square lattice is not known exactly , but is indistinguishable numerically from the unique positive root of the equation @xmath29 we denote the generating function by @xmath30 it will be useful to define a second generating function for those saw which start at the origin @xmath31 and end at a given point @xmath32 as @xmath33 in terms of this generating function , the _ mass _ @xmath34 is defined @xcite to be the rate of decay of @xmath35 along a coordinate axis , @xmath36    here , we are interested in a restricted class of square lattice saw which start at the origin @xmath31 , end at @xmath37 and are entirely contained in the square @xmath38 \\times [ 0,l].$ ] a _ fugacity _ , or weight , @xmath9 is associated with each step of the walk .",
    "historically , this problem seems to have led two largely independent lives .",
    "one as a problem in combinatorics ( in which case the fugacity has been implicitly set to @xmath39 ) , and one in the statistical mechanics literature where the behaviour as a function of fugacity @xmath9 has been of considerable interest , as there is a fugacity dependent phase transition .",
    "the problem seems to have first been seriously studied as a mathematical problem by abbott and hanson @xcite in 1978 , many of whose results and methods are still powerful today .",
    "a key question considered both then and now , is the number of distinct saw on the constrained lattice , and their growth as a function of the size of the lattice .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the number of @xmath23-step saw which start at the origin @xmath31 , end at @xmath41 and are entirely contained in the square @xmath38 \\times [ 0,l].$ ] further , let @xmath42 then @xmath43 is the number of distinct walks from the origin to the diagonally opposite corner of an @xmath19 lattice . in @xcite , and independently in @xcite , it was proved that @xmath44 the value of @xmath45 is not known , though bounds and estimates have been given in @xcite .",
    "one of our purposes in this paper is to improve on both the bounds and the estimate .",
    "like so many problems in lattice statistics , this one owes a debt to j. m. hammersley . a closely related problem to the one considered here is discussed in @xcite , which is in turn devoted to problems posed by hammersley .",
    "however the earliest mention of this problem appears to be by knuth @xcite , who calculated the number of saw crossing a @xmath46 square by monte carlo methods , and estimated the number to be @xmath47 it is now known , see table  [ tab : totser ] below , that the correct answer is @xmath48 a related problem was studied by edwards in @xcite .",
    "he considered saw starting at a point denoted the origin with end point a distance @xmath11 from the origin , and no other points at distance @xmath11 or greater .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the number of such saw .",
    "then edwards proved that @xmath50 exists and lies between 2.3 and 5.0 . in our notation , edwards has proved that @xmath51 edwards also proved that the same limit holds for saw from the origin to the boundary of any convex , bounded subset of @xmath22 his numerical work led him to suggest that @xmath45 is about 1.77 .",
    "our best estimate , given below , is 1.744550(5 ) .",
    "the problem of hamiltonian paths on an @xmath52 rectangular grid , going from @xmath31 to @xmath53 has also been considered previously .",
    "earlier work is described in @xcite , where collins and krompart also give generating functions for the number of such paths on grids with @xmath54 in @xcite jacobsen and kondev gave a field - theoretical estimate of the growth constant for hamiltonian saw on the square lattice , which must fill a square , as @xmath55 .    in the statistical mechanics literature",
    ", the problem appears to have been introduced by whittington and guttmann @xcite in 1990 , who were particularly interested in the phase transition that takes place as one varies the fugacity associated with the walk length .",
    "all walks on lattices up to @xmath56 were enumerated , and the estimate @xmath57 was given . at a critical value ,",
    "@xmath58 the average walk length of a path on an @xmath19 lattice changes from @xmath59 to @xmath60 where we define @xmath61 as follows : let @xmath62 and @xmath63 be two functions of some variable @xmath9 .",
    "we write that @xmath64 as @xmath65 if there exist two positive constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 such that , for @xmath9 sufficiently close to @xmath68 , @xmath69 in @xcite the critical fugacity was proved to be at least @xmath70 , its value was estimated numerically and was conjectured to be @xmath71 , and in @xcite the conjecture was proved by madras .",
    "the problem was subsequently taken up by burkhardt and guim @xcite , who extended the enumerations given in @xcite to @xmath72 lattices , and used their data to give the improved estimate @xmath73 by considering saw as the @xmath74 limit of the o@xmath75 model of magnetism , burkhardt and guim show that the conjecture @xmath71 made in @xcite on numerical grounds follows directly , though this is not a proof , unlike the subsequent result of madras @xcite .",
    "they also gave a scaling _ ansatz _ for the behaviour of @xmath76 for @xmath11 large in the vicinity of @xmath77 they proposed @xmath78\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 , as described above , and @xmath80 is the corner exponent of the magnetisation @xcite , given by cardy s @xcite result @xmath81 for a wedge - angle @xmath82 , which is @xmath83 in this case .",
    "@xmath84 is the surface exponent that characterises the decay of spin - spin correlations parallel to the boundary in the semi - infinite geometry , corresponding to wedge - angle @xmath85 consequences of this scaling ansatz include the following predictions : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 they tested these results from their numerical data , and found them well supported .",
    "we provide even firmer support for these results on the basis of radically extended numerical data .",
    "equation ( [ ds ] ) has also previously been given by duplantier and saleur @xcite .",
    "burkhardt and guim also considered a generalisation of the problem considered here by including a second fugacity , associated with steps in the boundary .",
    "this allows the problem of adsorbing boundaries to be studied . we will not discuss this aspect of the problem further , except to note that in @xcite a full scaling theory is developed , and the predictions of the theory are tested against numerical data .    in @xcite the slightly more general problem of saw constrained to an @xmath52 lattice",
    "was considered , where the analogous question was asked : how many non - self - intersecting paths are there from @xmath31 to @xmath89 if one denotes the number of such paths by @xmath90 it is clear that , for @xmath91 finite , the paths can be generated by a finite dimensional transfer matrix , and hence that the generating function is rational @xcite .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it was proved that @xmath92 ( where here we have corrected a typographical error ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath93 where @xmath94 .    in this paper",
    "we also consider two further problems which can be seen as generalisations of the stated problem .",
    "firstly , we consider the problem where saws are allowed to start anywhere on the left edge of the square and terminate anywhere on the right edge ; so these are walks _ traversing _ the square from left to right .",
    "we call such walks _ transverse _ walks .",
    "secondly , we consider the problem in which there may be several independent saw , each saw starting and ending on the perimeter of the square . the saw",
    "are not allowed to take steps along the edges of the perimeter .",
    "such walks partition the square into distinct regions and by colouring the regions alternately black and white we get a _ cow - patch _ pattern .",
    "each problem is illustrated in figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "an example of a saw configuration crossing a square ( left panel ) , traversing a square from left to right ( middle panel ) and a cow - patch ( right panel ) . ]    following the work in @xcite , madras @xcite proved a number of theorems .",
    "in fact , most of madras s results were proved for the more general @xmath95-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice , but here we will quote them in the more restricted two - dimensional setting .    the following limits , @xmath96 are well - defined in @xmath97 .    more precisely ,    * @xmath98 is finite for @xmath99 , and is infinite for @xmath100 moreover , @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 * @xmath104 is finite for all @xmath105 moreover , @xmath106 for @xmath99 and @xmath107 for @xmath100    in @xcite the existence of the limit @xmath104 was proved , and in addition upper and lower bounds on @xmath104 were established .",
    "the average length of a ( weighted ) walk is defined to be @xmath108    for @xmath102 , we have that @xmath109 as @xmath110 , while for @xmath12 , we have @xmath111 .    in @xcite",
    "it was proved that @xmath112 .",
    "the situation at @xmath15 is unknown .",
    "we provide compelling numerical evidence that in fact @xmath113 , where @xmath79 , in accordance with an intuitive suggestion in both @xcite and @xcite .    for @xmath114 ,",
    "define @xmath115 and @xmath116    * the function @xmath117 is a strictly increasing , negative - valued convex function of @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 as @xmath121 , where @xmath34 is the _ mass _ , defined by ( [ eq0 ] ) . *",
    "the function @xmath122 is a strictly increasing , convex function of @xmath118 for @xmath123 and satisfies @xmath124    some , but not all of the above results were previously proved in @xcite , but these three theorems elegantly capture all that is rigorously known .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in the next section we describe our enumeration methods , and explain how they are used to obtain radically extended series expansions for the number of walks crossing a square , the number of cow - patch configurations and the number of transverse saw .",
    "section 3 details the results we have obtained .",
    "in section 4 we derive methods for obtaining rigorous upper and lower bounds on @xmath125 in that section we show that upper bounds based on counting cow - patch configurations are fully equivalent to the method of abbott and hanson , based on 01 admissible matrices .",
    "an improved method of lower bounds based on counting transverse walks is also derived . in section 5",
    "we then apply these methods to our radically extended enumerations to provide significantly improved bounds on @xmath125 in section 6 we give exact results for short saw crossing a square .",
    "the shortest saw that can cross a square from @xmath31 to @xmath41 is of length @xmath126 we give the exact number of such saw of length @xmath127 for @xmath128 and asymptotic results for @xmath129 .",
    "section 7 is devoted to a numerical analysis which gives precise ( though non - rigorous ) estimates of @xmath130 for all three types of configurations , a discussion of the mean number of steps as a function of fugacity , fluctuations in this quantity , and a scaling theory for such fluctuations .",
    "we also speculate on the nature of the sub - dominant behaviour of the asymptotic form for the number of saw .",
    "section 8 is also a numerical study , but of the number of saw that pass through the central vertex of an @xmath19 square . finally in section 9",
    "we study hamiltonian paths , obtaining both rigorous upper and lower bounds on the growth constant , and a numerical estimate .",
    "in the following we give a fairly detailed description of the algorithm we use to enumerate the number of walks crossing a square and briefly outline how this basic algorithm is modified in order to include a step fugacity , study saws traversing a square and the cow - patch configurations .",
    "we use a transfer matrix algorithm to count the number of walks crossing @xmath52 rectangles .",
    "the algorithm is based on the method of conway et al .",
    "@xcite for enumerating ordinary self - avoiding walks .",
    "the transfer matrix technique involves drawing a boundary line through the rectangle intersecting @xmath131 or @xmath132 edges .    for each configuration of occupied or empty edges",
    "we maintain a count of partially completed walks intersecting the boundary in that pattern .",
    "walks in rectangles are counted by moving the boundary adding one vertex at a time ( see figure  [ fig : transfer ] ) .",
    "rectangles are built up column by column with each column constructed one vertex at a time .",
    "configurations are represented by lists of states @xmath133 , where the value of the state @xmath134 at position @xmath135 must indicate if the edge is occupied or empty .",
    "an empty edge is indicated by @xmath136 .",
    "an occupied edge is either free ( not connected to other edges ) or connected to exactly one other edge via a path to the left of the boundary .",
    "we indicate this by @xmath137 for a free end , @xmath138 for the lower end of a loop and @xmath139 for the upper end of a loop connecting two edges .",
    "since we are studying self - avoiding walks on a two - dimensional lattice the compact encoding given above uniquely specifies which ends are paired .",
    "read from the bottom the configuration along the intersection in figure  [ fig : transfer ] is @xmath140 ( prior to the move ) and @xmath141 ( after the move ) .",
    "the left panel shows a snapshot of the intersection ( dashed line ) during the transfer matrix calculation .",
    "walks are enumerated by successive moves of the kink in the boundary , as exemplified by the position given by the dotted line , so that the @xmath52 rectangle is built up one vertex at a time . to the left of the boundary",
    "we have drawn an example of a partially completed walk .",
    "numbers along the boundary indicate the encoding of this particular configuration .",
    "the right panel shows some of the local configurations which occur as the kink in the intersection is moved one step . ]",
    "there are major restrictions on the possible configurations and their updating rules .",
    "firstly , since the walk has to cross the rectangle there is exactly one free end in any configuration .",
    "secondly , all remaining occupied edges are connected by a path to the left of the intersection and we can not close a loop .",
    "it is therefore clear that the total number of 2 s equals the total number of 3 s .",
    "furthermore , as we look through the configuration from the bottom the number of 2 s is never smaller than the number of 3 s ( they are perfectly balanced parentheses ) .",
    "we also have to ensure that the graphs we construct have only one connected component . in the following we",
    "shall briefly show how this is achieved .",
    ".[tab : update ] the various ` input ' states and the ` output ' states which arise as the boundary line is moved in order to include one more vertex .",
    "each panel contains up to three possible ` output ' states or other allowed actions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the fluctuations @xmath142 as a function of the fugacity @xmath9 ( top left panel ) . @xmath143 and @xmath144 vs. @xmath11 ( top right panel ) .",
    "@xmath145 ( bottom left panel ) and @xmath146 ( bottom right panel ) vs. the scaling variable @xmath147 . ]",
    "in @xcite knuth also considered the problem of self - avoiding walks crossing the square _ and _ passing through the centre @xmath148 of the grid ( with @xmath11 being even ) .",
    "denote the number of such walks by @xmath149 then a straightforward variant of the method of proof used in section [ sec : altbounds ] can be applied to prove that @xmath150 knuth used monte carlo simulations to estimate the fraction of paths hitting the centre point and found for @xmath151 that @xmath152 percent of all paths do hit the centre .",
    "he then went on to say that `` perhaps nobody will ever know the true answer . ''",
    "naturally we can not let knuth s challenge go unanswered .",
    "it is very simple to modify the transfer - matrix algorithm to ensure that all paths pass through a given vertex .",
    "we just make sure that when we do the updating at the given vertex the input state @xmath153 ( no occupied incoming edges ) has only one output state @xmath154 , while the output @xmath153 ( no outgoing occupied edges ) is disallowed at this vertex .",
    "we can thus answer knuth s query and state for all to know that for @xmath151 a fraction @xmath155 of all paths pass through the centre . in table  [",
    "tab : centre ] we have listed the number of paths passing through the centre for @xmath156 .",

    "these were walks confined to a square geometry , but not restricted as to starting and end - points as are those we consider here .",
    "nevertheless , it seems likely that we are estimating the same quantity , so our results can be seen as providing support for the view that the field theory is estimating precisely the same quantity as our enumerations .",
    "that is to say , this appears to be precisely the same as the corresponding result for hamiltonian walks on an @xmath19 lattice , in the large @xmath11 limit .",
    "these estimates are about @xmath176 less than @xmath130 the growth constant for all paths . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that @xmath177 numerically this evaluates to @xmath178    we can improve on these bounds as follows : we define cow - patch walks to be hamiltonian if every vertex of the square not belonging to the border of the square belongs to one of the saws of the cow - patch . then the upper bounds given above translate verbatim into upper bounds for @xmath179 while lower bounds are given by hamiltonian traversing paths and eqn .
