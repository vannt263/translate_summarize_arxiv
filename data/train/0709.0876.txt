    "in addition to elastic cotunneling ( not shown ) , the following processes contribute to current flow : ( a ) inelastic cotunneling with emission of one vibron ; ( b ) population of the molecule by inelastic sequential tunneling with absorption of one vibron ; depopulation by ( c ) elastic sequential tunneling or ( d ) inelastic sequential tunneling with emission of at most two vibrons .",
    "molecular states are symbolized by @xmath8 where @xmath6 refers to the charge state and @xmath9 to the vibrational state .",
    "[ levelschema ] ]    the basic process which allows current to flow through the molecule is cotunneling in which an electron tunnels between the leads with intermediate virtual occupation of the molecule . cotunneling necessarily leaves the vibrational state unchanged for bias voltages @xmath10 ( elastic cotunneling ) . assuming temperatures @xmath11 , vibrons can be excited once @xmath12 [ inelastic cotunneling , cf .",

    "if the vibrons excited by inelastic cotunneling decay only slowly , their presence opens a new transport channel which is responsible for the occurrence of vibrational absorption sidebands . indeed , absorption of these vibrons by an electron may energetically allow _ sequential _ tunneling processes onto or off the molecule even though they are forbidden in the absence of vibron absorption [ cf .",

    "for this reason , we expect that ( if energetically allowed ) , inelastic cotunneling events are rapidly followed by a sequential tunneling event involving vibron absorption .",

    "this picture of transport in the regime of vibrational absorption sidebands has several additional consequences .",
    "( i ) with increasing vibrational relaxation time , the current through the junction will increase since each inelastic cotunneling event will be followed by an increasing average number of sequentially tunneling electrons .",
    "( ii ) the fact that inelastic cotunneling events are rapidly followed by sequentially tunneling electron(s ) effectively implies electron bunching and thus super - poissonian shot noise .",
    "( iii ) this bunching becomes stronger for larger electron - vibron coupling @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , vibrational absorption sidebands become more prominent with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "vibrational absorption sidebands are amenable to an analytical description for both weak and strong electron - vibron interaction , @xmath30 and @xmath31.@xcite results for these regimes give good qualitative insight also for the crossover region of intermediate coupling constants @xmath32 , where an analytical description becomes more cumbersome .",
    "in view of the generic nature of the phenomenon under discussion , our considerations are based on the anderson - holstein model@xcite for a single - molecule device in which transport is dominated by one gate - tunable spin - degenerate molecular orbital @xmath4 coupled to a single harmonic vibrational mode with frequency @xmath5 , as described by the hamiltonian @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the charging energy , the operator @xmath35 annihilates an electron with spin projection @xmath36 on the molecule , and @xmath37 denotes the corresponding occupation - number operator . @xmath38 annihilates the vibrons .",
