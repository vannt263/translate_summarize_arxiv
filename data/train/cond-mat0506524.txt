    "the essential physics of the hole - doped high-@xmath14 cuprates can be described as that of a doped mott insulator , which exhibits several phases varying from antiferromagnetic insulator to metallic superconductor .",
    "the elucidation of the basic physics of these various complicated phases by studying the elementary excitations could yield information essential for uncovering the mechanism of high-@xmath14 superconductivity .",
    "experimental techniques that can probe the charge excitations have been dramatically developed in recent years .",
    "in particular , resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) in the hard x - ray regime has attracted much attention due to its ability to probe the momentum dependence of the charge excitations .",
    "this technique was initially applied to nio ;  @xcite in that case a large enhancement of the inelastic signal with incident photon energy was observed near the ni k edge .",
    "more recently this technique has been applied to various cuprates including high-@xmath14 materials  @xcite and other highly - correlated electron systems .",
    "@xcite    a recent rixs study near the cu k edge in undoped la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 ( lco ) has revealed three features in its charge excitation spectrum .",
    "@xcite two features , labeled a and b , appear at energy transfers @xmath17  ev and 3.9  ev , respectively ; these features show the largest intensity enhancement at an incident photon energy of @xmath18  kev .",
    "the other feature , labeled c , appears at @xmath19  ev , and resonates at the higher incident energy of @xmath8  kev .",
    "since the resonance energy of the a and b features corresponds to the absorption feature associated with a well - screened state ,  @xcite these two have been attributed to the charge - transfer ( ct ) excitations from the o @xmath20 to the cu @xmath21 upper hubbard band . on the other hand ,",
    "the resonance energy of feature c is associated with a poorly screened state , and has been attributed to a molecular orbital ( mo ) excitation that involves a transition between bonding and anti - bonding states of the cu @xmath21 and o @xmath20 orbitals .  @xcite    recently , there has been a number of rixs studies of doped cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite for the la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) system , kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the two features of the ct excitations in lco are also observed for @xmath22 , but only a single feature is observed at @xmath23  ev for @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , a continuum - like excitation appears for @xmath13 below the charge transfer excitation energy ( @xmath24  ev ) at the zone center ( 0  0 ) and at the zone boundary @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite the zone center result is consistent with optical measurements which show a transfer of the spectral weight from the ct excitation to lower energies .",
    "@xcite for the mo excitation , the excitation energy increases with doping .",
    "@xcite this was attributed to the decreased cu - o distance in doped samples , which leads to an increased energy splitting between the bonding and antibonding molecular - orbitals due to the increased @xmath25 hybridization .",
    "although measurements have been carried out for underdoped and optimally doped samples , the overdoped region has not yet been studied with rixs .",
    "such studies should yield important insights into the nature of the charge excitations observed with the rixs technique .",
    "we note that thus far lsco appears to be the only high-@xmath14 system where large , high quality heavily overdoped crystals are available . in this paper , we report rixs results for overdoped lsco with @xmath26 and 0.30 ; the primary purpose of this study is to elucidate the evolution of the charge excitations in the overdoped region .",
    "we find that the ct and mo excitations in the overdoped compounds exhibit resonantly enhanced intensity over a broader range of incident energies than those of an optimally - doped and undoped ( parent ) compound .",
    "we also observe that the near - edge x - ray absorption spectrum exhibits a feature associated with the well - screened final state , which is well - defined similar to its counterpart in underdoped samples . on the other hand",
    ", we do not find a well - defined peak corresponding to the poorly - screened final state .",
    "profiles measured utilizing a high energy resolution spectrometer configuration indicate that the continuum excitation exists below 3  ev at @xmath11 in addition to the @xmath12 and @xmath10 positions . on top of the continuum intensity , we observed an additional excitation at @xmath27  ev , which exhibits resonantly enhanced intensity around @xmath28  kev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the experimental details .",
    "the ct and mo excitations measured with a conventional rixs setup are presented sec .",
    "iii , while a detailed study of the continuum intensity below 3  ev using the high resolution setup is reported in sec .",
    "finally the results are summarized in sec . v.",
    "since the results for the @xmath26 and @xmath4 crystals are quantitatively similar , we do not distinguish between these two samples in our discussion unless there is a special need .",
    "single crystals of lsco with @xmath26 and @xmath4 for the rixs measurements were grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone ( tsfz ) method in the same manner as those used for neutron - scattering experiments .",
    "@xcite the grown crystal rods have a typical size of 6  mm in diameter and 80  mm in length ; they were cut into pieces 5  mm @xmath29 4  mm @xmath29 1  mm along the tetragonal @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32-directions , respectively , and annealed at 850  @xmath33c for 12 hours in flowing oxygen to compensate for oxygen deficiencies .",
    "the temperature dependence of the superconducting shielding fraction determined by magnetization measurements shows that the @xmath26 sample has @xmath34  k whereas the @xmath35 sample shows no bulk superconductivity down to 2  k. the @xmath36 surfaces , which the x - ray beams in the rixs experiments are incident upon , were polished using a 1 @xmath37 m grit size .",
    "the rixs experiments were performed at the undulator beam line 9idb at the advanced photon source at argonne national laboratory . for the measurements of the ct and mo excitations , we used the si ( 333 ) reflection from the double bounce main monochromator , together with a spherical ge(733 ) analyzer with 1  m radius of curvature .",
    "this setup gives an instrumental energy resolution of 0.4  ev full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "for the measurement of the continuum intensity below @xmath38  ev , a si(444 ) channel - cut secondary monochromator was used in addition to a si(111 ) primary monochromator . a spherical ge(733 )",
    "analyzer with a 2  m radius of curvature was also utilized .",
    "this spectrometer configuration yielded a net energy resolution of 0.13  ev ( fwhm ) .",
    "more technical details of the finer resolution setup has been reported in ref .  .",
    "the energy resolution has been measured by scanning an incoherent background signal along the energy direction . for the finer resolution setup",
    ", we cooled the samples down to 9  k by a closed cycle refrigerator to reduce a possible phonon contribution to the elastic background intensity .",
    "however we found that the elastic peak width along the energy direction does not show clear temperature dependence .",
    "thus , we conclude no phonon effect on the elastic peak .    for all measurements , the scattering plane was vertical and the polarization of the incident x - ray was fixed along the @xmath31-axis .",
    "typical scans were performed by counting for 2 minutes at each data point , and the counts were normalized to monitor counts corresponding to 1 s. in our analysis , we have used the following background subtraction and normalization method .",
    "the largest source of background arises from the contribution of the elastic ( @xmath39 ) intensity .",
    "the energy gain ( @xmath40 ) side spectrum is expected to represent purely background intensity , since the detailed balance factor at this temperature and energy scale vanishes .",
    "therefore , the background subtracted intensity can be written as @xmath41 @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the raw intensity , assuming that the elastic background is symmetric in @xmath44 . unless noted otherwise , we used the intensity of the cu k@xmath45 emission line as a normalization factor , since this emission intensity is expected to be proportional to the sample volume probed .    at last , throughout this paper",
    ", we use tetragonal notation with @xmath46     along the cu - o - cu direction , corresponding to @xmath47  @xmath48 .",
    "first , we present the experimental results for the main spectral features , which correspond to the ct and the mo excitations .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the rixs spectra as a function of the incident energy @xmath7 near the cu k edge at the positions @xmath49 corresponding to a position near the zone center @xmath50 and @xmath51 corresponding to the zone boundary position @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately , the zone center @xmath53 position is contaminated at @xmath54 presumably by the tails of the bragg peaks at ( 3 , 0 , 1 ) and ( 3 , 0 , @xmath55 ) , so that the data have been obtained at positions slightly away from the zone center . however",
    ", a relatively high elastic intensity remains at @xmath56 , producing a broader tail than that at @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless , a similar incident energy dependence of the rixs spectra is observed at both positions with a ct excitation around 4  ev and the mo excitation around 8  ev , exhibiting resonance enhancements at @xmath57  kev and @xmath58  kev , respectively .",
    "= 5.5 in    to study any possible change of the rixs spectra as a function of momentum and doping , the spectral weight has been calculated by simply summing up the background subtracted and normalized intensity between 2  ev and 12  ev .",
    "spectral weights so obtained for the data at @xmath56 and @xmath10 are shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) by circles and squares , respectively .",
    "although the ( near ) zone center data show smaller spectral weights , the @xmath7 dependence appears to be very similar at both positions .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) which shows the @xmath7 dependences of the spectral weights normalized to their maximum values .",
    "thus , although the excitation energies are slightly different at different @xmath59 positions as shown in fig .  1 , the resonance behavior is similar .    = 3.3 in",
    "we observe that the spectral weight does not show a well - defined peak at @xmath60  kev , which is the mo excitation resonance energy , whereas the spectral weight has a peak at @xmath61  kev , the ct excitation resonance energy .",
    "we also found that the x - ray absorption spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , which is measured by monitoring the intensity of cu k@xmath45 line at @xmath62  kev , does not exhibit a well - defined peak associated with the so - called poorly - screened state around @xmath6  kev .",
    "this result should be contrasted with the results in the undoped samples .",
    "figure  2(d ) shows the spectral weight of la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 calculated in the same manner using the data reported in ref .  .",
    "it is clearly seen that the spectral weight of la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 has two well - defined peaks at the energies where the ct and the mo excitations resonate .",
    "consistent with this , the absorption spectrum of la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 also has the well - defined peaks for both well - screened and poorly screened states as shown in fig .",
    "@xcite since such a two - peak structure has also been observed for the @xmath13 sample ,  @xcite the disappearance of the higher energy peak in the absorption spectrum and the broad nature of the rixs spectral weight distribution seem to be characteristic of overdoped metallic samples .",
    "= 3.3 in    the dispersions of the ct and the mo excitations have been studied by collecting the rixs spectra at fixed @xmath63  kev and 8.998  kev at several @xmath64-positions between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and between @xmath65 and @xmath67 .",
    "the data have been fitted by a lorentzian function with a sloping background to determine the excitation energies .",
    "the dispersions so obtained are shown in fig .",
    "the ct excitation appears at 3.7  ev at the zone center and reaches 4.2  ev at @xmath10 and 5  ev at @xmath11 .",
    "this dispersion is qualitatively similar to that observed in the @xmath13 sample .",
    "@xcite the actual profiles , however , show systematic changes with increasing hole concentration .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "4 indicates profiles of the ct peak for @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( from refs .   and  ) and @xmath4 . to compare the ct peak itself ,",
    "the intensity is normalized to the ct peak intensity .",
    "it may be clearly seen that the ct peak shifts its weight to higher energy with increasing doping at all @xmath64 positions .",
    "this is consistent with an increase of the ct gap with doping predicted by tsutsui _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and agrees quantitatively with their numerical calculations .",
    "@xcite the large value of this shift ( @xmath70  ev ) is somewhat surprising , given that the chemical potential shift due to the hole doping observed in photoemission experiments is less than 0.5  ev.@xcite however , the upper hubbard band shifts to higher energy as holes are doped .",
    "@xcite this combined effect of the chemical potential shift and the shift of the unoccupied band seems to contribute to the large overall shift of the ct feature .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the large shift of the ct peak energy in the overdoped regime may imply a large overlap of the o @xmath20 and the lower hubbard cu @xmath21 bands , resulting in the existence of partially doped - holes with cu @xmath21 character in the overdoped regime .",
    "this in turn would suppress magnetic correlations as reported by recent neutron scattering measurements of the overdoped samples .",
    "@xcite however , detailed numerical calculations are necessary to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "= 3.3 in    the nature of the mo excitation also appears to differ from that in the @xmath13 sample .",
    "@xcite although the zone boundary has a lower excitation energy than the zone center as is the case for @xmath13 , the dispersion of the overdoped sample is flat in the large @xmath64 region as shown in fig .",
    "3 . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the energy and the dispersion of the mo excitation increases as the cu - o distance decreases , and concomitantly the hybridization between the cu @xmath71 and the o @xmath72 orbitals becomes stronger .",
    "the excitation energy of 7.6  ev at @xmath73 is very close to that of the @xmath13 sample which has the same cu - o distance as the @xmath26 sample , and , moreover , if we define the dispersion as the difference between the energies at @xmath10 and @xmath74 , the overall dispersion of @xmath75  ev of the present sample is similar to that of the @xmath13 sample ( @xmath76  ev ) .",
    "the plots on the left side of fig . 4 show clear evidence for the appearance of a low energy excitation below the ct peak for the doped samples . although the excitation spectrum around 1  ev for the undoped sample decreases to the background level ( intensity at @xmath77  ev ) , the intensity at 1  ev remains well above the background in the doped samples . as reviewed in sec .",
    "1 , kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have observed that the continuum intensity at low energy ( @xmath78  ev ) exists at ( 0  0 ) and at @xmath10 , but not at @xmath11 . to test this in the overdoped sample ,",
    "we have compared the rixs spectra for @xmath26 at @xmath10 and @xmath79 .",
    "the top - right panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the as - measured data of rixs spectra taken with @xmath80  kev including the peak around 19  ev due to the cu k@xmath45 fluorescence emission .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows the same spectrum after normalization using the cu k@xmath45 intensity . both spectra exhibit a constant intensity between 1 and 3 ev as shown by the shaded area ,",
    "although the continuum intensity at the @xmath11 position appears to be smaller than that at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the data are suggestive of the existence of the continuum excitation even at @xmath11 in the overdoped samples .",
    "= 3.3 in    = 3.3 in    we have also measured the rixs spectra for @xmath35 at 9  k utilizing the high resolution instrumentation ( @xmath81  ev ) which enables us to study the detailed structure of the continuum excitation . figure  5 shows the evolution of the rixs spectra as a function of @xmath7 between 8.992 and 8.994  kev at @xmath10 .",
    "it appears that there is a small peak on top of the continuum intensity at @xmath82  ev resonating in the range of @xmath83  kev .",
    "this may be more clearly seen in the right panel of the figure , where the background subtracted spectra are plotted on a different scale to emphasize the continuum region .",
    "the data below 1  ev have a large ambiguity due to the tail of the elastic peak , while the increase of @xmath84 above 2.5  ev is due to the ct peak .",
    "a peak at 1.5  ev is , nevertheless , clear in the range of @xmath85  kev .",
    "similar features have been found at the @xmath11 position .",
    "figure 6 shows plots analogous to those in fig .  5 for @xmath11 .",
    "in the right panel , the profile at @xmath86  kev exhibits a peak of 0.5  counts / s appearing around @xmath87  ev on top of the continuum intensity of 1  count / s , whereas the data at @xmath88 and @xmath89  kev show only a flat continuum intensity .",
    "as @xmath7 increases to 8.994  kev , the peak appears to become broader and larger , and seems to shift to higher energy .",

    "figure 7 shows the background - subtracted and normalized rixs intensity @xmath90 at @xmath91  ev along the @xmath92 direction which is equivalent to the trajectory in a reduced momentum space shown by an arrow in the inset .",
    "it is evident that a peak develops at @xmath79 with increasing energy transfer and it reaches an intensity of @xmath93  counts / sec . at 1.8  ev on top of the @xmath64-independent continuum intensity of 1  count / sec ,",
    "consistent with the data for @xmath86  ev in fig .",
    "it is open question what the origin of this excitation is . from a consideration of the excitation energy of this feature ,",

    "first , the resonance behavior in this overdoped sample appears to be broader in incident photon energy than that of the undoped parent material .",
    "furthermore , in the absorption spectra of the overdoped samples , the peak corresponding to the poorly - screened state is damped .",
