    "-1 quantum cohomology is a new mathematical discipline influenced by the string theory as a joint venture of physicists and mathematicians .",
    "the notion was first proposed by vafa  @xcite , and developed by witten @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the theory consists of some new approaches to the problem of constructing invariants of compact symplectic manifolds and algebraic varieties .",
    "the approaches are related to the ideas of a @xmath0-dimensional topological quantum field theory , which indicate that the general principle of constructing invariants should be as follows : the invariants of a manifold @xmath1 should be obtained by integrating cohomology classes over certain moduli space @xmath2 associated to @xmath1 . in our case the manifold is a symplectic manifold @xmath3 , and the moduli space @xmath2 is the space of certain @xmath4-holomorphic spheres @xmath5 in a given homology class @xmath6 .",
    "the relevant cohomology classes on @xmath2 are the pullbacks @xmath7 of the cohomology classes @xmath8 under the evaluation maps @xmath9 given by @xmath10 for fixed @xmath11 .",
    "then the integration of a top dimensional product of such classes ( or equivalently , the evaluation of the top dimensional form on the fundamental class @xmath12 $ ] ) gives rise to the gromov ",
    "witten invariant @xmath13\\rangle.\\ ] ] these invariants are independent of the choices of @xmath14 in @xmath15 used in their definitions , and can be interpreted as homomorphisms @xmath16 given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 dual of @xmath20 .",
    "the invariant @xmath21 counts the number of intersection points ( with signs of their orientations ) of the image of the @xmath22-fold evaluation map @xmath23 with the cycles representing the @xmath20 , where the dimension of the homology class @xmath24 is chosen so that if all the intersections were transversal , there would be only a finite number of such points .",
    "this is simply the number of @xmath4-holomorphic spheres in the given homology class @xmath25 which meets the cycles representing @xmath26 .    the importance of the @xmath4-holomorphic spheres and the gromov ",
    "witten invariants is that they may be used to define a quantum deformation of the cup product in the cohomology ring @xmath27 of a compact symplectic manifold @xmath1 making it a quantum cohomology ring @xmath28 .",
    "the description of the gromov  witten invariants can be given in terms of a general riemann surface @xmath29 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have made this expository introduction somewhat simpler by taking @xmath30 .",
    "the results that guided our approach are to be seen in the work of macduff and salamon  @xcite .",
    "a symplectic manifold @xmath3 is a smooth manifold @xmath1 of dimension @xmath31 with a symplectic structure @xmath32 on it which is a closed differential @xmath33-form @xmath32 such that the volume form @xmath34 is nowhere vanishing on @xmath1 .",
    "the basic example is the euclidean space @xmath35 with the constant symplectic form @xmath36 where @xmath37 are coordinates in @xmath35 .",
    "the next basic example is provided by the phase space of a hamiltonian system , that is , by the cotangent bundle @xmath38 of any @xmath39-manifold @xmath40 with a symplectic structure which is locally the pullback of the structure @xmath41 on @xmath35 .",

    "symplectic geometry is quite different from riemannian geometry , and also from khlerian geometry .",
    "the darboux theorem says that locally any two symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are diffeomorphic .",
    "therefore locally all symplectic manifolds are the same , and there is no local invariant in symplectic geometry , like , for example , the curvature in riemannian geometry .",
    "the only possible invariants have to be global .",
    "the darboux theorem makes it difficult to study the global structure on a symplectic manifold .",
    "although variational techniques may be employed to tackle some global problems , it is the theory of @xmath4-holomorphic curves of gromov that applies to many problems of symplectic manifolds .",

    "since @xmath60 is pathwise connected , the complex bundles @xmath63 are isomorphic for different choices of @xmath64 .",

    "one may contrast this situation with that in complex geometry where one often defines a curve as the set of common zeros of a number of holomorphic polynomials .",
    "such an approach makes no sense in the case when the almost complex structure is non - integrable , since there may not exist holomorphic functions @xmath86 when @xmath4 is non - integrable .",
    "let @xmath72 be an almost complex manifold without boundary , and @xmath29 be a riemann surface of genus @xmath87 with complex structure @xmath81 .",

    "it will appear from the computations for @xmath128 mentioned above that the complex anti - linear part of @xmath128 has order @xmath138 .",

    "as described above , we may suppose by using a homotopy of order @xmath138 that our fredholm operator @xmath128 is complex linear with @xmath154 .",

    "it can be shown that different choices of @xmath4 give rise to cobordant maps @xmath306 . since the cobordant maps have the same degree , @xmath307 is independent of all choices . in the case",
