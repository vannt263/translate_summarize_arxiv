    "according to standard models , the x - ray emission of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) originates in the innermost regions of the accretion flow , via inverse compton scattering of the disc thermal photons in a hot , optically thin plasma ( the so called corona ) located above the accretion disc ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this primary x - ray emission interacts with the optically thick matter of the accretion disc and the molecular torus , producing a reflection spectrum @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is characterised by a series of fluorescence lines , the most prominent , due to a combination of fluorescence yield and cosmic abundance , is the fe k@xmath0 line at 6.4 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the reflection spectrum extends also to the hard x - ray band , where emission is produced as a consequence of compton - back scattering of the high energy photons ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) from the primary continuum .",
    "this reflection continuum typically peaks at @xmath520 - 30 kev producing a prominent broad feature , known as the compton hump .",
    "when the reflection arises from the inner regions of the accretion disc , it will be affected by the strong gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "the result is an fe k@xmath0 emission line whose shape is modified into a skewed and asymmetric profile ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . since the relativistic lines originate within few gravitational radii from the central object , the analysis of these features represents a powerful probe of the innermost region of the agn .",
    "analysis of the fe line complex ( i.e. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) has revealed the presence of a ubiquitous narrow component in the spectra of the brightest agn observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku_. assuming a standard accretion disc , expected in high efficiency systems such as bright seyfert galaxies , broad fe k@xmath0 lines should also be detected in the x - ray spectra .",
    "however , in samples of objects , where _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations were analysed , some sources and/or observations were missing this component ( 30@xmath6 of the sources in @xcite , 60@xmath6 in @xcite , 50@xmath6 in @xcite and 20@xmath6 in @xcite ) .",
    "the reason why this component is not detected in some cases is still unclear .",
    "several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this puzzle .",
    "looking at the samples compiled with _",

    "another possible explanation is that in some sources the disk is truncated , so that the inner radius is large and the relativistic effects relatively small . @xcite",
    "have on the other hand suggested that strong relativistic effects , disk ionization and/or high disk inclination can explain the apparent lack of relativistic signatures , due to the difficulty of disentangling very broad features from the continuum .    the aim of this work is to investigate this phenomenon by analyzing _ suzaku _ observations of sources previously observed with _",

    "the bottom panels of figure [ plotapp ] show the data to model ratios for the xis spectra when the relativistic relline model is applied to the data .",
    "the broad line residuals present in several cases in the middle panels ( narrow line model ) are generally well fitted by the _",

    "however , in the case of ngc 7469 residuals around 6.4 kev are still present even if a relativistic fe line is included ( and detected at more than 95@xmath6 confidence ) .",
    "this could be due to the fact that we have used fixed parameters in the fits .",
    "we tested this by letting the inner radius , the inclination and the emissivity index free to vary in the _ relline _ model component for this source .",

    "different symbols and colours in the plot correspond to different sources as described in the legend .",

    "in contrast , whenever the counts in the fe band are higher than @xmath5 4 @xmath3 10@xmath4 , we generally see evidence for the presence of a broad fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "nevertheless , we do detect a relativistic fe line in spectrum with fewer counts ( @xmath5 3 @xmath3 10@xmath22 ) .",
    "in mrk 590 , the inferred equivalent width of the line ( @xmath5 450 ev ) is much larger than is typical , accounting for the detection . in 6 out of 7 observations of ngc 5548",
    ", we measured only an upper limit to the flux of the relativistic fe line . in one observation , however , we find an apparently intense broad line with ew@xmath23 ev , albeit at low significance .",
    "it seems likely that this is due to malmquist bias , whereby we see a positive statistical fluctuation in the line strength resulting in an apparent detection of a strong line , when the true ew is much lower .",
    "we further note that at some epochs exhibits absorption feature in the fe k - band , which may complicated the detection of the broad fe k emission ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that while the trend of positive detections at high signal - to - noise ratio is clear , there are also spectra with high signal - to - noise ratio where only upper limits are obtained , most notably for ic4329a , where one such upper limit is inconsistent with the detections in the same source .",
    "this is discussed further in section [ specialcases ] .",
    "the results on this source are consistent with the previous work of @xcite where the same _ suzaku _ observations were analyzed .",
    "the authors pointed out that the relativistic line in this object is relatively weak and detected with high significance only when the data are combined together .",

    "the relativistic relline model described above provides an improvement to the fit in many cases , but the model is not self - consistent .",
    "this is because , as the disk is expected to be optically thick , the relativistic line should be accompanied by a reflection continuum which is also modified by the same relativistic effects as the line . furthermore , the strength of the continuum should be linked to the line .",
    "this latter consideration also applies to the reflection continuum associated with the narrow emission line , which was fitted separately from the line in our baseline model .    to provide a more physical and self - consistent model for the spectra",
    ", we used the _ pexmon _ model ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model reproduces the main features of the reflection spectrum produced by the interaction of the primary continuum with a compton thick layer of neutral material ( accretion disk and/or torus ) .",
    "this model combines : i ) a narrow fe k@xmath0 line at 6.4 kev ; ii ) a narrow fe k@xmath14 line at 7.06 kev ; iii ) a narrow ni k@xmath0 line at 7.47 kev ; iv ) compton reflection and v ) an fe k@xmath0 compton shoulder .",
    "we adopt two such components , one from distant material ( e.g. the torus ) and another modified by relativistic effects in the accretion disk .",

    "expressed as @xmath31-@xmath32 .",
    "this is helpful to understand whether the fe emission line strength and the compton hump at higher energies are simultaneously well - fitted , since the _ pexmon _ model links these two quantities while the _ rellline _ model does not .",
    "we find in general that the physically self - consistent model provides a similar fit to the phenomenological one , showing consistency between the strength of the fe k@xmath0 line and the reflection continuum at high energies ( e.g. compton hump ) .",
    "however , in two cases ( mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 and ic 4329a obs .",
    "i d 702113020 ) the @xmath12 between the relativistic pexmon and the relativistic relline models is large ( @xmath33 ) , indicating a much better fit if the line and continuum are decoupled .",
    "we now consider these cases in more detail .",
    "we investigate here the two extreme cases where the relativistic relline model gives better fit to the data , with a @xmath33 , compared to the more self - consistent relativistic pexmon model : mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 and one observation of ic 4329a ( i d : 702113020 ) .",
    "the case of mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 has already been noted by @xcite .",
    "they found a detection of relativistic fe k@xmath0 line , but without any reflection component at higher energies . the results of our analysis are fully consistent with this result ( see table [ relline ] ) .",
    "when the relativistic pexmon model is applied to the data , it leads to an inadequate fit with @xmath34 = 122.74 compared to the relativistic relline model .",
    "the reason is that , in the former , the compton hump is linked to the strength of the emission line , while in the latter they are independent .",
    "this can be discerned immediately from the parameters in table [ relline ] .",
    "the reflection fraction @xmath35 for mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 is very small and well constrained @xmath36 .",
    "conversely both the narrow and relativistic lines are well detected and have a combined equivalent width of 156 ev , corresponding to a total reflection fraction of @xmath37 .",

    "the plot shows the best fit model of the xis spectrum extrapolated to the high energy band , and compared to the pin data .",
    "the bottom panel shows the data to model ratio for both the xis and pin spectra .",
    "it is evident that the _ pexmon _ model greatly overestimates the amount of reflection at high energies .",
    "physically , there are several possible interpretations for the appearance of the spectrum of mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 .",
    "the first is that the line emission arises from material of small optical depth , producing a line but with little compton scattering , and hence compton hump .",
    "this interpretation is very unlikely : the line emission in this source is strong and low optical depth material would likely underproduce the emission line unless other circumstances were in play .",
    "a second possibility is that the material has very high fe abundance .",
    "this could produce line emission which is relatively strong compared to the compton hump .",
    "we tested for this possibility by allowing the fe abundance to be a free parameter in the two _ pexmon _ models . letting this parameter free to vary , the fit does improve ( @xmath15/d.o.f .",
    "= 1238.17/1323 ) . however , the values of the fe abundance for the two components of the _ pexmon _ model are very extreme ( a@xmath38/a@xmath39 @xmath599 ) .",
    "this explanation therefore also seems quite unlikely .",
    "while the fe abundance can explain an anomalous ratio of the line to the continuum , it does not explain why the absolute value of the reflection fraction as measured by the compton hump is so low in this source .",
    "the most likely explanation for the phenomenology of mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 is related to our assumptions about the high energy cutoff . in our fit",
    "we have assumed an exponential cutoff of 300 kev .",
    "this ensures that there are plentiful high energy photons which can be downscattered into the compton hump .",
    "if the temperature of the corona is lower , this will suppress the high energy reflection while having little effect on the strength of the fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "we tested this by fitting the spectrum imposing an high energy cutoff of e@xmath40 = 50 kev in both the relativistic relline and the relativistic pexmon models .",

    "we fitted the spectrum with the _ relxill _ model ( @xcite ) together with a narrow _ pexmon _ component .",
    "the _ relxill _ model allows us to fit the reflection spectrum produced by ionized material in the inner regions of the accretion disk , modified by relativistic effects .",
    "the best fit @xmath17 for this model is 1254.91/1322 , which is comparable to that obtained with the relativistic relline model .",
    "the model fit constraints the inclination , the reflection fraction from the disk and the high energy cut - off of the primary continuum : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 kev .",

    ", a relativistic fe k@xmath0 line is not detected .",
    "however , a significant contribution of the reflection continuum at high energies is present , and it is well constrained ( see table [ relline ] ) .",
    "this is a particularly puzzling case , because the relativistic fe k@xmath0 feature , while relatively week , is detected in all the other _ suzaku _ spectra of this object ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ icextra ] shows the unfolded spectrum for this observation when the relativistic pexmon model is applied only to the xis spectrum and extrapolated to high energies , and compared to the pin data .",
    "formally a sub - solar fe abundance can account for the weak fe k@xmath0 line in this individual observation .",
    "we let the fe abundance vary in both the relativistic relline and relativistic pexmon models .",
    "the best - fit fe abundance for the two models indeed appear to be sub - solar ( relativistic relline : 0.46@xmath44 ; relativistic pexmon : 0.25@xmath45 ) .",
    "the difference in the goodness of fit between the two also reduces substantially , with @xmath46 , much less then the the @xmath12 = 55.61 obtained with solar abundances .",
    "however , the other observations of ic 4329a have fe abundance close to solar .",
    "a variation of the fe abundances is highly unlikely , especially if we consider the short time scale between each observation ( @xmath5 1 week ) .",
    "these observations of ic 4329a therefore provide a challenge to the prevailing reflection paradigm .",
    "we have analysed a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies observed with _ suzaku _ , which had previously shown an absence of evidence for a relativistic fe k@xmath0 emission line in their _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "the goals of this work were to investigate whether the _ suzaku _ spectra show evidence for the relativistic line , and whether the line , if present , is consistent with the measured strength of the compton hump . to achieve these aims",
    ", we systematically fitted the spectra of all the sources with a series of models of varying complexity , testing for the presence of relativistic lines and their consistency with the compton reflection hump at higher energies .",
    "as in previous work , we find that all the spectra show a peak at 6.4 kev which we identify with a narrow line from relatively distant material .",
    "the majority of the sources show additional complexity around the fe k - complex , however . several sources also show evidence for more highly ionized species , identified with fe xxv and fe xxvi .",
    "in addition , at least one observation of all the sources in our sample , and 12 out of 22 in total , shows a significant improvement when a relativistic line is added to the model . where broad lines are detect in our sample , the typical equivalent widths are in the range 50 - 100 ev , and the upper limits in the case of non - detections rarely exclude such values .",
    "this is fully consistent with the work of @xcite , using xmm - newton data , who found an average broad line ew of @xmath47 ev . both are consistent with the work of @xcite where a sample of seyfert 1 agn was analyzed using _ suzaku",
    "_ observations . in this case",
    ", the mean ew within the sample was found to be 96@xmath48 ev .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sources in our sample were chosen because the relativistic line in the previous _ xmm - newton _ spectra is weak and/or of low significance , but our results show that in reality they are entirely consistent with typical line strength seen in more complete samples .",
    "the results for the individual sources in our sample are also broadly consistent with previous work .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 5506 revealed the presence of a broad residual in the fe band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the overall emission complex was equally well fit either with a broad line or a blend of he - like and h - like narrow lines .",

    "recently , a _ nustar _",
    "observation of ngc 5506 was analyzed by @xcite .",
    "a significant relativistic fe k@xmath0 line was not required in their fitting of that spectrum , perhaps suggesting a variation of the intensity of the line between the _ suzaku _ and _ nustar _ observations , which are separated by @xmath57 years .",
    "the results of the analysis on the bright seyfert 1 galaxy , ic 4329a are consistent with the work of @xcite , where the same five _ suzaku _ observations were analysed , plus an additional suzaku observation which is simultaneous with a _ nustar _ observation .",

    "this difference could be due to the fact that they modelled the mean spectrum and not the single observations separately and also again to the fact that the parameters of the _ relline _ model were free to vary .",
    "as discussed above , a relativistic fe k@xmath0 line was already detected in mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 in the same _ suzaku _ observation with an equivalent width of about 90 ev ( @xcite ) , and our measurements are consistent with these results ( ew = 92@xmath52 ev ) .",

    "the same _ suzaku _ spectrum was also analyzed by @xcite , who fitted the data with a relativistic line with an equivalent width consistent within the errors with our result ( ew= 91@xmath56 ev ) .    finally , there are two objects in our sample where the evidence for any relativistic fe k@xmath0 emission line is very weak , those being ngc 5548 and mrk 590 .",
    "we note that no broad fe k@xmath0 line was detected also in previous observations of these objects ( ngc 5548 : @xcite , mrk 590 : @xcite ) . in both of these sources , however , the constraints on any broad component in the spectrum are poor , with upper limits typically several 100 ev , usually in excess of the typical ew for the detected broad lines of @xmath57 ev .",
    "the apparent absence of a broad features is therefore like due to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the data .",
    "overall , our results are broadly consistent with the idea that relativistic fe k@xmath0 emission line is ubiquitous in the x - ray spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the lack of detection in some sources and/or observations can be attributed to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra analyzed .",
    "this result confirms previous conclusions from the analysis of _ xmm - newton _ spectra , where it was claimed that high signal - to - noise ratio is necessary for the detection of broad fe lines of typical equivalent width ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our sample analysis shows that broad line are consistently detected when the counts in the 5 - 7 kev energy band are @xmath2 4 @xmath3 10@xmath4 .    taking advantage of the extended energy band of _ suzaku _ , we were also able to examine the relationship between the emission of the fe k@xmath0 line and the reflection continuum at higher energies .",
    "in particular , we compared the fits with our relativistic relline model , which allows the fe line and reflection strengths to vary independently , with a more self - consistent reflection model ( relativistic pexmon model ) , in which the line and compton hump are linked in the ratio expected for a compton - thick slab . for the vast majority of the observations ( 19/22 ) , this self - consistent model gives a better or comparable fit to the phenomenological relativistic relline model .",
    "this shows that in general the line and reflection strengths in agn are consistent with each other , in support of the idea that both arise from the same material . in two cases the self - consistent model leads to an inadequate fit , that of mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 and in one of the spectra of ic 4329a , which shows a difference in fits statistic of @xmath12 @xmath58 50",
    "surprisingly , these two observations exhibit this behaviour for opposite reasons .    in mcg + 8 - 11 - 11 , as already noted by @xcite ,",
    "strong evidence for a relativistic fe line is present , but with the absence of any reflection emission at high energy . a possible explanation for the lack of reflection in this source could be a low value of the high energy cut off ( e.g. @xmath5 50 kev ) .",
    "this hypothesis could be tested using high energy data of higher quality , as can be expected e.g. from _",
    "nustar_.    the opposite situation pertains to one observation of ic 4329a ( obs .",
    "i d : 702113020 ) . in this spectrum",
    "the relativistic line was not detected , with a tight upper limit , while a strong reflection continuum is observed at high energies .",
    "this is very puzzling , especially when considered in context with the other observations of ic 4329a with _",
    "suzaku_. these do show both a relativistic line and a reflection continuum , with strengths that are typically consistent with each other .",
    "the lack of consistency in just one case argues against some interpretations , such as an unusual fe abundance in the reflecting material .",
    "a possible explanation for the results is rapid variability of the geometry of the inner regions of the disk , for example variability of the illuminating pattern and/or ionization state of the disk , or strong relativistic effects ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these might results in unusual line and continuum properties , such as strong line profile variations , or extreme broadening of the line , which may make it difficult to distinguish from the continuum .",
    "overall , however , it is difficult to provide a robust interpretation for why in this source the line and reflection continuum would not follow each other . if the two components can exhibit differential variability of this kind , it is not only difficult to explain , but also difficult to make predictions which would allow models to be tested .",
    "this is troublesome for the standard reflection models , and unless an interpretational framework can be established , diminishes their diagnostic power .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the suzaku satellite , a collaborative mission between the space agencies of japan ( jaxa ) and the usa ( nasa ) .",
