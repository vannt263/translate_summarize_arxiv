    "since the discovery@xcite of carbon nanotubes , it stimulated extensive studies on the lattice dynamics of the single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnt).@xcite the swcnt can be viewed as rolling up a two - dimensional graphitic lattice into a seamless cylinder.@xcite among various studies , the zone - folding method was firstly applied to study the lattice dynamics of the swcnt , which is migrated from that for the planar graphite sheet .",
    "it successfully accounts the general features of the phonon spectrum in swcnt .",
    "however , unlike the electronic problems , on which this method is workable except for very narrow swcnt , the results for the lattice vibration by the zone - folding were not very satisfactory,@xcite particularly , it can not provide correct numbers of raman and infrared ( ir ) modes of swcnt.@xcite    in recent a few years , the theoretical investigation on lattice dynamics of swcnt has achieved many successful and interesting results . using the rotational and helical symmetries , popov _",

    "_ applied the line group analysis to the lattice dynamics of swcnt,@xcite and also obtained the generalized bloch form by modified group projectors technique.@xcite they also calculated the phonon spectra in swcnt with a modified force constant model@xcite in which certain kinematic constraints were imposed to achieve the twisting mode .",
    "the authors tried also to fit their calculated frequencies of the raman and ir modes as functions of tube radius and chiral angel . in a series of papers mahan and",
    "his collaborators@xcite worked on the lattice dynamics of the swcnt with various vibrational energy terms such as spring energy , in - plane or out - of - plane bond bending potential energies successively , and calculated the phonon spectrum for the achiral as well as chiral@xcite tubes .",
    "they realized that , to keep the twisting mode to be a zero mode in the long wave length limit , all the pieces of vibration energies under their consideration violating the global rotational invariance around axial axis should be ignored .",
    "the authors also interpreted the existence condition of the flexure mode , which is an inherent character for rods and plates .",
    "this mode also shows up in popov _ et .",
    "_ s calculation but is absent in damnjanovic _",

    "s results .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .  , the commonly used expression for bond bending potential , even in addition with the kinematic constraints as in refs   and , does not satisfy the rotational invariance condition , where the missing of the flexure mode is a kind of evidence . at the same time , the discussion on the rotational symmetry requirements to the potential terms in connection with the flexure mode is restricted only to those around the tube axis .",
    "the force model@xcite taken from that for the graphite@xcite obeys the translational and rotational sum rules of the planar sheet but does not meet precisely the symmetry requirements of cylindrical warped hexagonal lattice sheet .",
    "actually , the rotational invariance symmetry , i.e. , the potential energy must keep unchanged when a system is rigidly rotated , should play a nontrivial role for rod - like cylindrical lattice sheet . on the other hand",
    ", the intrinsic symmetry of the tube lattice structure would also lead to specific restriction on dynamic matrix . for a complete account of the symmetries of the lattice dynamics for the swcnt ,",
    "both aspects should be considered in a consistent way .",

    ", we show the vibration potential , i.e. force model , up in a detailed expression with the rigid translational and rotational invariance being precisely guaranteed , in which the curvature effect on bond lengths and bond angles is carefully considered . as its direct consequences ,",
    "the flexure mode as well as the acoustic torsion mode can be correctly treated .",
    "moreover we calculate the phonon spectrum with the proposed force model and carry out a full chiral symmetry analysis . instead of previous case - to - case empirical forms,@xcite the frequencies of all raman and ir active modes , the polarization characteristics of the modes , as well as the velocities of all four acoustic modes",
    "can be systematically fitted in terms of tube radius and chiral angle with the symmetry considerations .",
    "as expected , our calculated results show that the curvature effect on bond lengths and bond angles would be no more negligible only for nanotubes of smaller radius .",
    "meanwhile the nontrivial contribution for the @xmath0 dependence of varies physical quantities is also effective only for tubes with enough small radius . for thin tubes with the diameter range such as @xmath1   ,",
    "the warped graphene sheet model , on which our discussions are based , should be fairly applicable to the swcnt .",
    "for tubes with diameter smaller than 4   approximately , the warped graphene sheet model might have to be improved by further optimizing its equilibrium lattice configuration,@xcite and the part of chiral symmetry analysis in this paper were not be valid any more . such estimation is entirely consistent with the existing literatures.@xcite    the present paper is organized as following . in sec .",
    "ii , after a brief description on notations , we present the detailed expression of the vibrational potential .",

    "<S> in this paper , we provide a detailed expression of the vibrational potential for the lattice dynamics of the single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnt ) satisfying the requirements of the exact rigid translational as well as rotational symmetries , which is a nontrivial generalization of the valence force model for the planar graphene sheet . with the model , the low frequency behavior of the dispersion of the acoustic modes as well as the flexure mode can be precisely calculated . based upon a comprehensive chiral symmetry analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated mode frequencies ( including all the raman and infrared active modes ) , velocities of acoustic modes and the polarization vectors are systematically fitted in terms of the chiral angle and radius , where the restrictions of various symmetry operations of the swcnt are fulfilled . </S>"
