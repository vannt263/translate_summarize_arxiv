    "the launch of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) in 1995 heralded a new era in our understanding of neutron star physics .",
    "detailed observations of quasiperiodic phenomena at khz frequencies in more than a dozen low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) strongly suggest that these systems contain rapidly spinning neutron stars ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) , providing support for the standard model for the formation of millisecond pulsars ( msp ) via spin - up due to accretion .    despite these advances",
    "several difficult questions remain to be answered by further observations and/or theoretical modeling .",
    "for example , we still do not know the reason for the apparent lack of radio pulsars at shorter periods than the 1.56  ms of psr1937 + 21 ( for a review of recent progress in the modelling of rotating neutron stars , see @xcite ) .",
    "the recent rxte observations provide a further challenge for theorists .",
    "various models suggest that the neutron stars in lmxb spin rapidly , perhaps in the narrow range 260 - 590  hz @xcite .",
    "three different models have been proposed to explain this surprising result . the first model ( due to @xcite )",
    "is based on the standard magnetosphere model for accretion induced spin - up , while the remaining two models are rather different , both being based on the idea that gravitational radiation balances the accretion torque . in the first such model for the lmxb ( proposed by @xcite and recently refined by @xcite ) , the gravitational waves are due to a quadrupole deformation induced in the deep neutron star crust because of accretion generated temperature gradients .",
    "the second gravitational - wave model relies on the recently discovered r - mode instability ( see @xcite for a review ) to dissipate the accreted angular momentum from the neutron star .",
    "in this letter we reexamine the idea that gravitational waves from unstable r - modes provide the agent that balances the accretion torque .",
    "this possibility was first analyzed in detail by @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "originally , it was thought that an accreting star in which the r - modes were excited to a significant level would reach a spin - equilibrium , very much in the vein of suggestions by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "should this happen , the neutron stars in lmxb would be prime sources for detectable gravitational waves",
    ". however , as was pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the original idea is not viable since , in addition to generating gravitational waves that dissipate angular momentum from the system , the r - modes will heat the star up ( via the shear viscosity that counteracts the r - mode at the relevant temperatures ) .",
    "since the shear viscosity gets weaker as the temperature increases , the mode - heating triggers a thermal runaway and in a few months the r - mode would spin an accreting neutron star down to a rather low rotation rate . essentially",
    ", this conclusion rules out the r - modes in galactic lmxb as a source of detectable gravitational waves , since they will only radiate for a tiny fraction of the systems lifetime .    other recent results would ( at first sight ) seem to emphasize the conclusion that the r - modes are not relevant for the lmxb .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect that the presence of a solid crust would have on the r - mode oscillations .",
    "they estimated that the dissipation associated with a viscous boundary layer that arises at the base of the solid crust in a relatively cold neutron star would greatly exceed that of the standard shear viscosity .",
    "thus , bildsten and ushomirsky concluded that the r - mode instability would only be relevant for very high rotation rates , and could therefore not play a role in the lmxb .",
    "we have reassessed the effect of the viscous boundary layer ( correcting an erring factor in the estimates of @xcite ) .",
    "our new estimates show that the presence of the crust is important , but that the instability operates at significantly lower spin rates than suggested by bildsten and ushomirsky .",
    "once we combine our estimates with the thermal runaway ( now due to heating caused mainly by the presence of the viscous boundary layer ) , that results as the star is spun up to the point at which the instability sets in , we arrive at a model for the spin - evolution of accreting neutron stars . remarkably , this simple model agrees well with existing observations of rapidly rotating neutron stars , covering both the lmxb and msp populations .",
    "the r - mode instability follows after a tug of war between ( mainly current multipole ) gravitational radiation that drives the mode and various dissipation mechanisms that counteract the fluid motion . in the simplest model , the mode",
    "is dominated by shear viscosity at low temperatures while bulk viscosity may suppress the mode at high temperatures . at intermediate temperatures",
    ", the r - mode sets an upper limit on the neutron star spin rate . in an interesting recent paper ,",
    "@xcite estimate the strength of dissipation due to the solid crust of an old neutron star , and find that the presence of a boundary layer at the base of the crust leads to a very strong damping of the r - modes .",
    "while we agree with the main idea and the various assumptions made by bildsten and ushomirsky , we would like to point out one important difference between their results and ones used previously in the literature .",
    "their assumed timescale for gravitational radiation reaction differs significantly from , for example , the uniform density result derived by @xcite ( and subsequently used by several authors , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is surprising since the uniform density result , which can be written @xmath1 ( where the negative sign indicates that the mode is unstable ) has been shown to be close ( within a factor of two ) to the results for @xmath2 polytropes .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 represent the mass , radius and spin period of the star , respectively .",
    "in contrast , @xcite use the @xmath2 polytrope result and argue that it corresponds to @xmath6  s for a canonical neutron star rotating with a period of 1  ms , i.e. assume that radiation reaction is almost one order of magnitude weaker than in ( [ gwapp ] ) .",
    "this difference occurs because bildsten and ushomirsky have only rescaled the fiducial rotation frequency @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 represents the average density ) in terms of which the @xmath2 polytrope results of @xcite were expressed ( @xmath9 for a specific polytropic stellar model ) .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure is not correct . from the fundamental relations ,",
    "e.g. the formula for the gravitational - wave energy radiated via the current multipoles , one can see that the gravitational - wave timescale should scale with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the way manifested in ( [ gwapp ] ) .",
    "thus , we believe that bildsten and ushomirsky underestimate the strength of radiation reaction significantly , which motivates us to reassess the relevance of the viscous boundary layer .",
    "we should , of course , emphasize at this point that our current understanding of the r - mode instability is based on crude estimates of the various timescales . in order to understand the role of the instability in an astrophysical context we must improve our modelling of many aspects of neutron star physics such as the effect of general relativity on the r - modes , cooling rates , viscosity coefficients , magnetic fields , potential superfluidity , the formation of a solid crust etcetera ( see @xcite for a description of recent progress in these various directions ) .    in the following",
    "we will mainly consider uniform density stars , i.e. use the gravitational - wave timescale given by ( [ gwapp ] ) . in estimating the dissipation timescale @xmath10 due to the presence of the crust , we need to evaluate @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mode - energy , and @xmath13 follows from an integral over the surface area at the crust - core boundary ( assumed to be located at radius @xmath14 ) , cf .",
    "equation ( 3 ) of @xcite . to evaluate this integral we use the standard result for the shear viscosity in a normal fluid . to incorporate our uniform density model",
    ", we make the reasonable assumption that the density of the star is constant ( @xmath15 ) inside radius @xmath4 .",
    "then it falls off rapidly in such a way that the base of the crust is located at a radius only slightly larger than @xmath4 .",
    "hence , it makes sense to use @xmath16 .",
    "if we neglect the small mass located outside radius @xmath4 we can then immediately compare the result for the viscous boundary layer to the timescales used by @xcite . in the end ,",
    "our estimate for the dissipation due to the presence of the viscous boundary layer is @xmath17 which is a factor of 2 larger than that of bildsten and ushomirsky .",
    "this difference arises simply because the mode - energy @xmath12 is this factor larger for uniform density models .",
    "the star is assumed to have a uniform temperature distribution , with core temperature @xmath18 .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the instability window obtained from our revised estimate . as is clear from this figure , the presence of a viscous boundary layer in an old",
    ", relatively cold neutron star is , indeed , important .",
    "however , bildsten and ushomirsky s conclusion that the r - mode instability is irrelevant for the lmxb can not be drawn from figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "on the contrary , the figure suggests that the instability may well be limiting the rotation of these systems .",
    "the fact that our revised instability curve for r - modes damped by dissipation in a viscous boundary layer agrees well with the fastest observed neutron star spin frequencies , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] , motivates us to speculate further on the relevance of the instability .",
    "we want to model how the potential presence of an unstable r - mode affects the spin - evolution of rapidly spinning , accreting neutron stars .",
    "to do this we use the phenomenological two - parameter model devised by @xcite , which is centered on evolution equations for the rotation frequency @xmath19 and the ( dimensionless ) r - mode amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "complete details of our particular version of this model will be given elsewhere .",
    "-0.15 in    at the qualitative level , our results are not surprising . accreting stars in the lmxb",
    "are expected to have core temperatures in the range @xmath21  k @xcite . for such temperatures the dissipation due to the viscous boundary layer gets weaker as the temperature increases .",
    "consequently , the situation here is essentially identical to that considered by @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "after accreting and spinning up for something like @xmath22 years , the star reaches the period at which the r - mode instability sets in . for our particular estimates",
    "this corresponds to a period of 1.5  ms ( at a core temperature of @xmath23  k ) .",
    "it is notable that this value is close to the 1.56  ms period of psr1937 + 21 .",
    "once the r - mode becomes unstable ( point a in figure  [ fig1 ] ) , viscous heating ( now mainly due to the energy released in the viscous boundary layer ) rapidly heats the star up to a few times @xmath24  k. the r - mode amplitude increases until it reaches a prescribed saturation level ( amplitude @xmath25 ) at which unspecified nonlinear effects halt further growth ( point b in figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "once the mode has saturated , the neutron star rapidly spins down as excess angular momentum is radiated as gravitational waves .",
    "when the star has spun down to the point where the mode again becomes stable ( point c in figure  [ fig1 ] ) , the amplitude starts to decay and the mode plays no further role in the spin evolution of the star ( point d in figure  [ fig1 ] ) unless the star is again spun up to the instability limit .",
    "two examples of such r - mode cycles ( corresponding to @xmath26 and 1 , respectively ) are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the real surprise here concerns the quantitative predictions of our model .",
    "as already mentioned , the model suggests that an accreting star will not spin up beyond 1.5  ms .",
    "this value obviously depends on the chosen stellar model , but it is independent of the r - mode saturation amplitude and only weakly dependent on the accretion rate ( through a slight change in core temperature ) .",
    "in fact , the accretion rate only affects the time it takes the star to complete one full cycle .",
    "as soon as the mode becomes unstable the spin - evolution is dominated by gravitational radiation and viscous heating .",
    "once the star has gone through the brief phase when the r - mode is active it has spun down to a period in the range 2.8 - 4.8  ms ( corresponding to @xmath27 ) . based on these results",
    "we propose the following spin - evolution scenario : an accreting neutron star will never spin up beyond ( say ) 1.5  ms . once it has reached this level the r - mode instability sets in and spins the star down to a several ms period . at this point",
    "the mode is again stable and continued accretion may resume to spin the star up .",
    "since the star must accrete roughly @xmath28 to reach the instability point , and the lmxb companions have masses in the range @xmath29 , it can pass through several `` r - mode cycles '' during its lifetime .",
    "let us confront this simple model with current observations .",
    "to do this we note that our model leads to one main prediction : once an accreting neutron star has been spun up beyond ( say ) 5  ms it must remain in the rather narrow range of periods @xmath30  ms until it has stopped accreting and magnetic dipole braking eventually slows it down .",
    "since a given star can go through several r - mode cycles before accretion is halted one would expect most neutron stars in lmxb and the msp to be found in the predicted range of rotation rates . as is clear from figure  [ fig1 ] , this prediction agrees well with the range of rotation periods inferred from observed khz quasiperiodic oscillations in lmxb .",
    "the observed range shown in figure  [ fig1 ] corresponds to rotation frequencies in the range 260 - 590  hz ( cf .",
    "our model also agrees with the observed data for msp , which are mainly found in the range @xmath31  ms , see figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "in other words , our proposed model is in agreement with current observed data for rapidly rotating neutron stars .    finally , it is worthwhile discussing briefly the detectability of the gravitational waves that are radiated during the relatively short time when the r - mode is saturated and the star spins down . as was argued by @xcite , the fact that the r - mode is active only for a small fraction of the lifetime of the system ( something like 1 month out of the @xmath22  years it takes to complete one full cycle ) means that even though these sources would be supremely detectable from within our galaxy the event rate is far too low to make them relevant . however , it is interesting to note that the spin - evolution is rather similar to that of a hot young neutron star once the r - mode has reached its saturation amplitude .",
    "this means that we can analyze the detectability of the emerging gravitational waves using the framework of @xcite .",
    "we then find that these events can be observed from rather distant galaxies . for a source in the virgo cluster ( assumed to be at a distance of 15  mpc ) these gravitational waves",
    "could be detected with a signal to noise ratio of a few using ligo  ii . however , even at the distance of the virgo cluster these events would be quite rare . by combining a birth rate for lmxb of @xmath32 per year per galaxy with the fact that the the volume of space out to the virgo cluster contains @xmath33 galaxies , and the possibility that each lmxb passes through ( say ) four r - mode cycles during its lifetime we deduce",
    "that one can only hope to see a few events per century in virgo . in order to see several events per year",
    "the detector must be sensitive enough to detect these gravitational waves from ( say ) 150  mpc .",
    "this would require a more advanced detector configuration such as a narrow - banded ligo  ii .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail elsewhere .",
    "before concluding our discussion , we recall that the initial excitement over the r - mode instability was related to the fact that it provided an explanation for the relatively slow inferred spin rates for young pulsars . in view of this , it is natural to digress somewhat and discuss how the picture of the r - mode instability in hot , newly born neutron stars is affected by the possible formation of a solid crust .",
    "hence , we consider the evolution of a neutron star just after its birth in a supernova explosion . at a first glance",
    ", we might expect to model its r - mode amplitude in the standard way , cf .",
    "@xcite , using the normal ( crust - free ) fluid viscous damping times for stellar temperatures above the melting temperature of the crust ( @xmath34 ) , and the viscous boundary layer damping time for temperatures below @xmath34 .",
    "however , the situation is a little more complicated than this .",
    "recall that the latent heat ( i.e. the coulomb binding energy ) of a typical crust is @xmath35  ergs , while the r - mode energy is @xmath36  ergs .",
    "provided that the time taken for the star to cool to @xmath34 is sufficiently long , the energy in the r - mode ( which grows exponentially on a timescale @xmath37  s ) will exceed @xmath38 , preventing the formation of the crust , even when @xmath39 .",
    "then the star will spin down in the manner described by , eg .",
    "this phase will end either because the star leaves the instability region of the @xmath40 plot ( see , for example , fig .  1 of owen et al . ) , or because the mode energy in the outer layers of the star ( where the crust is going to form ) has fallen below the crustal binding energy .",
    "we can estimate that this would happen at a frequency @xmath41 , by equating @xmath38 to roughly 10 % of @xmath42 ) .",
    "a more accurate treatment would take into account the _ local _ kinetic energy of fluid elements and since the latter is smaller near the poles than near the equator , the crust might form earlier at the poles . clearly the problem of crust formation in an oscillating star requires further investigation",
    ". the final spin period will be around 15  ms , if the r - mode grows to an amplitude of @xmath43 , consistent with the extrapolated initial spin rates of many young pulsars . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mode is not given time to grow very large it will not prevent crust formation at @xmath34 .",
    "such a scenario was described by @xcite , who noted that the r - mode instability would then not spin the star down beyond a much higher frequency .",
    "using our estimated timescales the resultant spin period would be @xmath44  ms in this scenario .",
    "which scenario applies depends sensitively on the early cooling of the star , the crustal formation temperature and perhaps most importantly the initial amplitude of the r - mode following the collapse .",
    "it is , in fact , possible that both routes are viable and that a bimodal distribution of initial spin periods results .",
    "a likely key parameter is whether the supernova collapse leads to a large initial r - mode amplitude @xmath45 or not .",
    "an initial period of @xmath46  ms would fit the long established data for the crab , while the recently discovered 16  ms pulsar prs  j0537 - 6910 @xcite requires a considerably shorter initial period of a few ms .    in conclusion , we have reexamined the effect that the dissipation due to a possible viscous boundary layer in a neutron star with a solid crust has on the stability of the r - modes . by combining our new estimates with the thermal runaway introduced by @xcite and @xcite , we arrive at a spin - evolution model that agrees with present observations for rapidly spinning neutron stars . in particular ,",
    "our predictions agree well with observations of both lmxb and msp .",
    "furthermore , the model can potentially explain the extrapolated spin periods of the young pulsars .",
    "since it brings out this unified picture , our simple model has many attractive features , and we are currently investigating it in more detail ."
