    "in her beautiful review of ( hot ) horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars , @xcite notes that @xcite was the first to detect the presence of ( blue ) horizontal - branch stars in globular clusters . the term _ horizontal branch _ appears to have been coined by @xcite , to whom @xcite assigns the discovery of the horizontal branch  which he noticed when plotting the color - magnitude data obtained by @xcite in the latter s study of ngc  5272 ( m3 ) .",
    "of course , with the development of nuclear astrophysics and the establishment of modern stellar evolution theory still several years away , it was not until three decades later that @xcite first correctly identified hb stars as the progeny of low - mass red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , burning helium in their center and hydrogen in a shell around the core .",
    "the first successful hb models were actually computed by @xcite , and @xcite and @xcite were the first to recognize that substantial mass loss on the rgb phase was needed to explain the observed colors of hb stars in globular clusters , with moreover a significant spread in mass loss amounts from star to star in any given globular cluster being needed to explain their observed color ranges  blue hb stars losing , on average , more mass than red hb stars .",
    "the distribution of masses along the hb often resembles a normal or gaussian distribution ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , and normal deviates are accordingly often adopted in the construction of `` synthetic horizontal branches '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of mass distributions that resemble gaussian deviates strongly suggests the presence of _ stochastic mass loss processes _ on the rgb .",
    "however , deviations from a gaussian shape are also not uncommon among globular clusters , particularly in the cases of those having bimodal hbs and/or long blue tails with gaps @xcite .",
    "it is virtually impossible to write a short review paper on hb stars covering `` observations '' , `` theory '' , and `` implications for the formation of the galaxy '' : each one of these subjects covers so much material that one could rather write separate review papers for each one of them .",
    "moreover , a review of hb stars can not be complete without looking into their progenitors and their progeny .",
    "the task of a reviewer of hb stars is accordingly a daunting one , and it is virtually impossible to aim at completeness . in the present paper , while attempting to cover a broad spectrum of hb - related topics , we again hold no hope of providing a complete review of the literature on these subjects .",
    "recent reviews focusing on several more or less specific topics related to hb stars have been provided by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; and very instructive earlier reviews , covering diverse astrophysical contexts , include those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "similarly , excellent sections focused on hb stars can be found in the reviews on the evolution of low - mass stars , population  ii stars , globular clusters , and related topics by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "other recent reviews by the present author on the subject of hb stars include @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we show a visual color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the carina dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite of the milky way , with several different hb components indicated , including both a _ red clump _ and a _ red hb_. the _ rr lyrae `` gap '' _ and the _ blue hb _ are also indicated .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : ngc ] shows cmds for the galactic globular cluster ngc  6752 , in the visual ( _ left panel _ ) and in the @xmath3 , @xmath4 plane ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "these plots reveal the complexity of the blue tail phenomenon , with the positions of the hba , hbb , and ehb components ( see below ) indicated , along with those of the @xcite and @xcite `` jumps '' and of possible blue hb gaps .",
    "the place where blue hook stars would be found , if present in the cluster ( ngc  6752 actually appears to lack blue hook stars , according to @xcite ) , is also schematically indicated .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly discuss each of these components in turn .",
    "red clumps originate from red giants that undergo the helium flash at the tip of the rgb while still having a total mass of more than @xmath5 ( but less than @xmath6 ; see , e.g. , fig .  2 in @xcite",
    "@xcite ) ; accordingly , they are commonly present in intermediate - age systems and old open clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are physically related to , but should not be confused with , the so - called `` red hb stars , '' which are less massive , significantly fainter and usually fall along the `` horizontal '' part of the hb , as clearly shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "a common mistake is to confuse `` red clump '' and `` rgb bump '' stars , but they are totally different types of stars : the latter are bona - fide red giants with a partially degenerate helium core that burn hydrogen in a thin shell surrounding the core @xcite .",
    "this hydrogen - burning shell moves outward in mass as the star evolves up the rgb , and eventually reaches a chemical discontinuity left behind by the previous , maximum inward penetration of the hydrogen - rich convective envelope , leading to a sudden replenishment of the shell with fresh nuclear fuel and a momentary reversal of evolutionary path on the rgb ( see * ? ?",
    "* for a review and additional references ) .",
    "recent papers discussing several different aspects of red clump stars include those by @xcite and @xcite .      as just stated , red hb stars are the lower - mass analogues of the red clump stars .",
    "they are commonly present in metal - rich ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as relatively young globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , red hb stars can also be found in metal - poor systems with `` normal '' ages , where they are usually interpreted as either the progeny of red giants that lost very little mass on their ascent of the rgb , or as former blue hb stars or rr lyrae variables that have evolved to the right on the color - magnitude diagram , now approaching the end of their evolution as hb stars and the beginning of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "another route towards producing ( admittedly fewer ) red hb stars is through the evolution of blue straggler stars ( bss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest , in fact , that a red hb star `` of bss origin '' should be present for every @xmath7 bss present in a given globular cluster .",
    "( note that , depending on the amount of mass lost by the bss on the rgb phase , at least some of these might better classify as red clump stars . )",
    "this is the part of the hb that crosses the cepheid instability strip .",
    "the term `` gap '' is very inadequate , but is still commonly used .",
    "the reason for this is that , in order to properly place an rr lyrae variable in the color - magnitude diagram , one needs to follow its whole pulsation cycle and thereby obtain reliable mean colors and magnitudes .",
    "since most color - magnitude diagram studies lack the sufficient time coverage , these stars are often simply omitted from the published cmds , thereby leading to an artificial `` gap '' at the instability strip level .",
    "however , there are indeed several globular clusters  the so - called _ bimodal - hb globular clusters_which do seem to have relatively few rr lyrae stars compared to the nonvariable hb stars to their right and left in the cmd ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review and extensive references ) .",
    "the most famous such cluster is ngc  2808 @xcite , which in spite of the recent discovery of a sizeable population of rr lyrae stars , still remains firmly classified as having a bimodal hb @xcite .",
    "as clearly revealed by its name , blue hb stars are hb stars falling to the blue of the rr lyrae instability strip .",
    "there have been numerous subdivisions of the blue hb , the most common including hba ( or a - type hb ) , hbb ( b - type hb ) , and ehb ( extreme or extended hb ) stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc ] ) .",
    "hba stars are blue hb stars cooler than about 12,000  k ; hbb stars include those with temperatures in the range between 12,000  k and 20,000  k ; and ehb stars include hb stars hotter than 20,000  k. the latter cover a remarkably small range in envelope masses , generally less than @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore also in total masses , since the he - core mass is essentially the same for all low - mass stars with a given chemical composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a visual cmd , the blue hb component may contain a `` horizontal '' part  the canonical blue hb ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd])and an effectively `` vertical '' component , commonly referred to as the _ the blue hb tail _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc ] ) .",
    "many authors have suggested that the blue hb proper and the blue hb tail are separated by a `` gap '' which is indeed seen in several globular clusters around @xmath9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but perhaps not in _ all _ clusters containing blue tails @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , several additional `` gaps '' may be present along the blue tail @xcite ; a recent , detailed description of these gaps has been provided by @xcite .",
    "several of these gaps , as discussed by @xcite , may still require more sophisticated statistical analyses to establish their reality beyond reasonable doubt , particularly when well - observed clusters seem to lack such gaps altogether , as in the case of m2 ( ngc  7089 ; * ? ? ?",
    "most impressively , @xcite has recently argued that the field `` blue hb star '' sample studied by @xcite and @xcite  and which gave rise to the very concept of gaps along the blue hb  is mostly comprised of stars in _ different _ evolutionary phases .",
    "we quote @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we expected to find [ based on detailed spectral analysis ] a high fraction of hb candidates among the faint blue high - latitude stars listed by @xcite and @xcite , especially in light of the ` gaps ' in the color distribution of these stars ... but fewer than half ( 11 of 27 ) of the newell stars that we observed were clearly hb objects , with another 11 stars classified as population  i dwarfs , and the remaining five stars marked as pagb [ post - agb ] , subgiants , and such . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the _ ehb component _ is the globular cluster analog of the field",
    "_ blue subdwarf _ ( or sdb ) stars @xcite . the majority of the ( nearby ) field sdb stars , according to @xcite and @xcite , appear to have disk kinematics , unlike hba stars , which they find to be mostly halo stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . accordingly ,",
    "@xcite pose the question whether field hba and ehb stars truly have a similar physical origin .",
    "detailed studies of the color - magnitude diagrams of globular clusters in several different bandpasses indicate the presence of additional `` fine structure '' on the blue hb , most notaly the _ grundahl jump _ @xcite at a temperature around 11,500  k , which is seen as a sudden deviation , towards brighter magnitudes , of hb stars hotter than this point , particularly evident when using the strmgren @xmath10 band @xcite .",
    "however , it is also present when using the johnson @xmath3 passband @xcite , as can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc ] .",
    "this `` jump '' has been interpreted by @xcite as due to _ radiative levitation and diffusion effects _ , which lead to the metal - poor hb stars hotter than 11,500  k possessing strongly _ metal - enhanced and helium - depleted atmospheres_. the earlier literature was extensively reviewed by @xcite ; empirical evidence supporting their arguments was provided in spectroscopic studies of blue hb stars in globular clusters by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "diffusion calculations that showed how some of the observed spectroscopic and photometric patterns come about were provided by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the `` gap '' at @xmath11 has been tentatively associated with this phenomenon @xcite , but such a color appears much redder than would be expected for the observed grundahl jump temperature of 11,500  k. in addition , the theoretical calculations by @xcite suggest that other bandpasses in the strmgren and johnson systems besides @xmath10 and @xmath3 should not be dramatically affected by this phenomenon .",
    "most interestingly , recent observations have shown that the grundahl jump phenomenon is also accompanied by a sharp drop in measured rotation velocities , blue hb stars hotter than 11,500  k presenting essentially no rotation , in contrast with cooler stars which may show quite significant rotation velocities , up to about @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "while @xcite note that the presence of rotation in both red and blue hb stars presents a problem for models in which rotation is a candidate second parameter , it must be noted that the abrupt disappearance of rotation exactly at the grundahl jump temperature indicates that diffusion and levitation patterns interfere with the star s observed surface rotation , somehow quickly damping the latter for temperatures higher than about 11,500  k @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have at present no means to check whether stars hotter than this temperature may have arrived on the zahb with surface rotation velocities faster than those observed for red hb and cooler hb stars .",
    "asteroseismology may provide a very useful probe of the ( internal ) rotation velocities of hot hb stars in the near future @xcite . a most intriguing piece of the puzzle is provided by the rr lyrae stars , for which no evidence of rotation has been observed so far (",
    "see @xcite @xcite for extensive references ) . why would cool blue hb stars and red hb stars show clear signatures of rotation , but not the intermediate - temperature rr lyrae variables ?",
    "more extensive spectroscopic observations of rr lyrae stars are clearly needed to settle this issue .",
    "what is the physical origin of the sudden onset of radiative levitation and diffusion patterns that lead to the @xcite jump at 11,500  k ?",
    "the answer to this question is not entirely clear at present , but @xcite noted that this temperature is very close to the one corresponding to the disappearance of surface convection in hb stars , thus strongly suggesting a link between the disappearance of convection and the onset of radiative levitation and gravitational diffusion effects in these stars .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggests that the low rotation velocities of stars hotter than the grundahl jump may be due to the spin down of the surface layers by a weak stellar wind induced by the radiative levitation of fe . as shown by @xcite , such winds",
    "are indeed predicted by theory .      before a star arrives on the hb",
    ", it must undergo a _ helium flash_the onset of helium burning , under partially degenerate conditions , which takes place at the tip of the rgb @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that several early hydrodynamic studies of the he - flash indicated the occurrence of an explosive event and actual _ disruption _ of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given that this prediction is in clear conflict with the very _ existence _ of hb stars , significant effort has also been devoted towards the computation of _ hydrostatic _ flashes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hydrostatic approximation , with some numerical and physical refinements , is still often used in modern calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and these have indeed been vindicated by modern hydrodynamic studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which revealed that the aforementioned hydrodynamical predictions were indeed incorrect .",
    "it is perhaps not a conclusively settled matter whether any of the material that is nuclearly processed during the he - flash may reach the surface of the star , and also whether one or more mass loss episodes may be triggered by the primary and secondary core flashes ; however , and to the extent that the latest he - flash calculations provide a realistic description of the process , no such phenomena should be expected .",
    "indeed , @xcite have recently pointed out that , due to expansion velocities that are much lower than the local sound speed , hydrostatic modeling should indeed capture the essence of the helium flash process . on the other hand , the 3d models by @xcite",
    "intriguingly reveal motions `` of an apparently convective nature '' _ beyond _ the h - burning shell , which these authors claim not to be directly associated with the flash , but which may bring the products of h - burning to the surface of the star .",
    "on the other hand , the situation can become much more complex when the star loses so much mass on its ascent of the rgb that the he - flash ends up taking place not at the rgb tip , but rather during the helium white dwarf cooling curve  a so - called _ late hot flasher _ @xcite . in this case ,",
    "extensive mixing between the envelope and regions that underwent significant hydrogen and helium burning is indeed expected , and these stars , when they finally manage to settle on the zero - age hb ( zahb ) , may end up as the so - called _ blue hook stars _ ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have temperatures in excess of 35,000  k @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with the case in which the star undergoes an _ early hot flash_i.e .",
    ", _ prior _ to arriving on the white dwarf cooling sequence  in which case @xcite find that no mixing takes place and a `` canonical '' ehb star results . in this scenario ,",
    "the reason why the blue hook stars appear fainter than its peers on the ehb is twofold .",
    "first , they tend to have smaller helium - core masses , due to the fact that they leave the rgb _ before _ igniting helium in their core , as a consequence of extreme mass loss on the rgb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , and most importantly in the late flasher scenario , their atmospheres present large enhancements in both helium and carbon as a consequence of mixing , thus affecting the bolometric corrections @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic evidence largely favoring this `` late flash mixing '' scenario for the origin of blue hook stars has recently been presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an intriguing indication from these spectroscopic studies for at least some of the hotter ehb stars is that some hydrogen still remains in their atmospheres , which is not expected on the basis of the theoretical models . as argued by @xcite ,",
    "some residual hydrogen may perhaps survive a late hot flash and later diffuse to the surface during the hb phase .",
    "note also that , in analogy with the @xcite `` jump , '' another `` jump '' has recently been suggested to be present in blue - tail globulars , namely the momany jump ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ngc ] ) , at a temperature around 21,000  k @xcite  which these authors conjecture to be related to the early helium flashers ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a critical discussion ) .",
    "recently , a sub - population of cluster stars with a large , primordial enhancement in the helium abundance has also been suggested as a possible channel producing the blue hook stars @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear how the abundance patterns observed in blue hook stars would be accounted for in this scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in like vein , @xcite have recently advanced the intriguing suggestion that at least some of the very hot and underluminous blue hook stars might actually be more straightforwardly explained as photometric blends and/or binary stars .",
    "until recently , it was thought that rr lyrae stars were the only class of variable stars on the hb .",
    "the situation has changed recently , with the discovery ( in a beautiful example of theoretical modelling preceding the observations ) of _ non - radial pulsation _ among sdb stars .",
    "these non - radial pulsators are now divided into two different groups",
    ". therefore , there are currently three known classes of variable hb stars , namely :    * _ rr lyrae stars _ : these are radial pulsators with periods in the range between about 0.2  d and 1.0  d , known to pulsate primarily in the _ fundamental mode _",
    "( rr lyrae stars of type a and b , now lumped together as rrab or rr0 stars ) and in the _ first overtone _ ( rr lyrae stars of type c , nowadays also referred to as rr1 stars ) .",

    "the notation in which the numbers 0 and 1 are used as opposed to the letters `` ab '' and `` c , '' respectively , was first introduced by @xcite .",

    "the notation `` rrd '' for these stars appears to first have been used by @xcite .",

    "this extremely important equation specifies that the period is inversely proportional to the square root of the mean density of the star , which in turn can be expressed in terms of the star s global physical parameters , such as mass @xmath20 , luminosity @xmath21 , and effective temperature @xmath22 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "depend on the star s detailed structural profile .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that the measured periods are directly related to the speed of travel of the sound waves across the stellar interior . in this sense ,",
    "the importance of the non - radial variables on the hb to constrain the internal structures of hb stars , including the amount of internal rotation , has recently been emphasized by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and nicely demonstrated in practice by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the high rotation velocity recently derived by @xcite for the post - agb star zng  1 in m5 might be accounted for , as noted by those authors , if rgb and hb stars are able to maintain rapid rotating cores , as may also be required @xcite to explain the presence of fast rotators on the hb ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : bhb ] for extensive references ) .",

    "the recent discovery of cepheid variables presenting pulsation amplitudes at the mmag level @xcite suggests that at least some of these `` non - variable '' stars may indeed be varying , though with much smaller amplitudes than would have been possible to detect with more traditional techniques  as nicely demonstrated by @xcite in the case of ngc  5897 . according to @xcite , ``",

    "conversely , in the near - ir , rr lyrae amplitudes become quite small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , rr lyrae stars usually reveal themselves more easily when time - series surveys are conducted using bluer bandpasses , whereas average magnitudes can be more easily computed using near - ir observations ( see also  [ sec : m31halo ] below ) .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to comment on the possibility that some stars in the rapid phase of evolution between the rgb tip and the zahb do in fact become variables .",
    "evolutionary paths for these stars are shown , for instance , in fig .  4 in @xcite and fig .  4 in @xcite , where it can be seen that many of these stars do cross the instability strip before settling on the zahb .",
    "while distinguishing them from more ordinary rgb , agb , and rr lyrae stars is obviously far from straightforward , both due to the very small expected number of stars in this phase and because of their overlapping with them on the cmd , their extremely fast evolutionary timescale ( @xmath25  yr ) hints at the possibility of identifying them by appropriate monitoring in wide - field surveys .",
    "this is because much more extreme _",
    "period change rates _ might obtain for them than for most other variables in a similar position on the cmd .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no other technique has been proposed in the literature for the detection of these elusive post - rgb tip / pre - zahb stars .",
    "the reader is referred to the recent paper by @xcite for an application of this method to the case of the galactic globular cluster m3 .",
    "while hb stars are relatively bright , their direct detection in distant systems ( i.e. , at the distance of m31 and beyond ) is a challenge .",
    "this is particularly so in the case of blue hb stars , which can be several magnitudes fainter than the `` horizontal '' level in @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc ] ) , due to the increase in the @xmath0-band bolometric correction at high temperatures . while the blue hb stars become brighter towards the far ultraviolet , which could make them candidates for detection from space , the required exposure times , at the distance of m31 , are prohibitively large .",
    "therefore , while extremely long - exposure _ hst _ observations have demonstrated that it is possible to reliably detect blue hb stars down to at least the main sequence turnoff level in m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , alternative approaches are needed at present to obtain a more complete assessment of the hb morphologies in extragalactic systems .",
    "the far - uv output from globular clusters is strongly dependent on the temperature of the sources . since hot hb stars are important uv emitters ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; see also @xcite @xcite for a recent review ) , this is expected to translate into a far uv ( integrated ) color  hb type correlation , especially when the contribution of bright , individual far - uv sources ( such as post - agb stars ) , which are present in clusters in non - statistically significant numbers , is removed from estimates of the integrated far uv colors .",
    "@xcite and landsman & catelan ( 2009 , in preparation ) tested this prediction , using integrated far uv fluxes for galactic globular clusters as summarized by @xcite , and including revisions to the far uv photometry based on images taken with the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : fuv ] , which depicts the trend of variation in the @xmath26 color ( where `` 15 '' stands for a bandpass centered at 1500   ) as a function of the hb morphology parameter @xmath27 @xcite , where @xmath28 is the number of blue hb stars bluer than @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the numbers of blue , variable ( rr lyrae ) , and red hb stars , respectively .",
    "the latter number counts are also widely used in constructing the so - called _ lee - zinn parameter _ , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the reason why we use the buonanno as opposed to the lee - zinn parameter is that it is more successful at breaking the degeneracy that characterizes @xmath34 in the case of clusters with completely blue hbs .",
    "more specifically , @xmath34 is not able to distinguish between a long blue tail cluster such as m13 or ngc  6752 and a stubby blue hb cluster such as ngc  288 ( all having @xmath35 ) , whereas @xmath27 ( as well as several other hb morphology parameters , including some of those defined by @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite ) are better suited for the task .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : fuv ] shows that , apart from the clusters with bimodal hbs ( ngc  6388 , ngc  6441 , m75 ) , there is a good correlation between the buonanno parameter and @xmath26 , characterized by a high correlation coefficient @xmath36 . using @xmath34",
    ", one finds an @xmath37 instead , but this is primarily due to the large difference in far uv color between 47  tucanae ( ngc  104 ) and the group of blue hb clusters : removing 47  tuc , the correlation coefficient , when using @xmath34 , drops to @xmath38 , whereas the one obtained using the buonanno parameters still remains fairly high at @xmath39 .",
    "these correlations are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions by @xcite for an @xmath40-enhanced composition , as can clearly be seen from the dotted line in figure  [ fig : fuv ] . in summary",
    ", one should be able to estimate , at least as a first approximation , the hb type of an old extragalactic globular cluster by measuring its _ integrated _ far uv light .    indeed , that the far uv light is a powerful diagnostic of the presence of hot hb stars has been demonstrated by the observation of a peculiarly high far uv flux from the moderately metal - rich galactic globular clusters ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 @xcite , which led the authors to suggest the existence of long blue tails in these clusters several years _",
    "these were first directly observed with _ hst _ @xcite .",

    "its recent detection in far - uv observations with galex @xcite lends support to their conclusion .",
    "the _ hst _ color - magnitude diagram for the cluster @xcite can not reveal the presence of hot hb stars since it just reaches the hb level , but it is not clearly inconsistent with the presence of a few blue hb stars at the `` horizontal '' level .",
    "values for their observed m31 globular clusters , no completeness corrections were applied in deriving them , which may lead to important underestimates of the number of blue hb stars  and therefore of @xmath34for those among them possessing well - populated blue hb tails . ]    to close , it is important to note that the h@xmath41 and h@xmath42 integrated indices can be sensitive indicators of the presence and temperature of hb stars in unresolved stellar systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; and references therein ) .",
    "the dependence of these and several other photometric and spectroscopic indicators on hb morphology has recently also been discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "another technique to infer the presence of a blue hb component in extragalactic systems without the need to obtain exceedingly deep photometry could use fairly bright _ type ii cepheids _ ( including bl herculis , w virginis , and rv tauri stars ) as an indicator .",
    "indeed , type ii cepheids are widely believed to be the immediate progeny of hb stars with little envelope mass ( but with still enough to reach the agb stage)i.e . ,",
    "blue hb stars .",
    "this is supported both by the observational record , which shows that type ii cepheids are present only when a sizeable blue hb component is also present @xcite , seemingly irrespective of the metallicity @xcite ; and by theoretical models ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; see also @xcite @xcite for a recent discussion and additional references ) .",
    "accordingly , detection of type ii cepheids should immediately imply the presence of a sizeable blue hb component . in this sense",
    ", it is worth noting that @xcite and @xcite found possible type ii cepheids in variability studies of small m31 halo fields ; if this classification is confirmed ( the authors note that the stars could also be anomalous cepheids , for instance ) , this would be consistent with the deep m31 cmds obtained by @xcite , which clearly reveal the presence of a sizeable ( though seemingly not very extended ) blue hb component . likewise , @xcite suggest that the m31 dsph satellites and  i and and  iii may also contain a small number of type ii cepheids , which should also imply the presence of blue hb components .",

    "importantly , it appears rather clear now that agb and rgb stars have different pulsation properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , first - ascent variables having smaller pulsation amplitudes and falling on a different period - luminosity relation than agb variables . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite suggest , based on the coincidence of the rgb pulsators belonging to the lmc , the smc , and the galactic bulge in a @xcite ( or period ratio vs. period ) diagram , that rgb pulsators with different metallicities do not have significantly different pulsation properties .",
    "if confirmed , these results may provide very important constraints on the extent to which mass loss on the rgb may vary with metallicity .",
    "it has recently been argued that the @xcite dichotomy may very well hold the key to the formation history of the galactic halo .",
    "the argument goes as follows : the galactic halo shows a sharp division between oosterhoff type i ( ooi , average periods of the ab - type rr lyrae variables @xmath55  d ) and oosterhoff type ii ( ooii , with @xmath56  d ) globular clusters , with very few clusters in the range @xmath57 ( the `` oosterhoff gap '' ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite galaxies of the milky way , as well as their respective globular clusters , fall _ preferentially _ on the `` oosterhoff gap '' region .",
    "one of the main scenarios for the formation of the galactic halo envisages the build - up of the halo from the accretion of smaller `` protogalactic fragments '' not unlike the present - day milky way dsph satellite galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , if this were the case , the present - day halo should _ not _ display the oosterhoff dichotomy , since the dsph galaxies and their globular clusters are predominantly intermediate between the two oosterhoff classes .",
    "therefore , the galactic halo can not have been assembled by the accretion of dwarf galaxies resembling the present - day milky way satellites  including , in fact , the lmc dirr @xcite .",
    "one criticism that might perhaps be drawn against this argument is related to the fact that not too many globular clusters satisfied the fairly strict selection criteria established by @xcite , which restricted his sample to globular clusters containing at least 10 known rrab variables with measured periods . with this selection criterion , @xcite found that 19 globular clusters were ooi , 9 were ooii , and two ( or 6.7% ) were oosterhoff - intermediate .",
    "two additional globular clusters , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , were tentatively assigned to a new class , ooiii @xcite .",
    "as one can easily see , only a relatively small fraction of the galactic globular clusters , of order 20% , were included .    in order to improve the statistics , we add to the sample originally studied by @xcite all galactic globular clusters with at least 5 known rrab variables with measured periods .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : oo ] ( _ left panel _ ) , where clusters with 5 to 10 rrab s are shown with smaller symbols than those with 10 or more fundamental - mode variables .",
    "while the main source is the extensive compilation and catalog of variable stars in galactic globular clusters by @xcite , this plot includes several updates compared to similar previous plots , such as the new measurements by @xcite for ngc  362 , by @xcite for ngc  6266 ( m62 ) , and by @xcite for ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "in addition , we separate the clusters into `` bulge/ disk , '' `` young halo '' and `` old halo '' subsystems , following the classification scheme by @xcite ( based on the positions of globular clusters in the hb morphology - metallicity plane ) . except for the peculiar positions of the clusters labeled as ooiii in this plot",

    "importantly , the sample size is now significantly larger , thus clearly improving the statistics : we find that , out of a total of 41 galactic globulars with periods measured for at least 5 rrab stars , only 4 ( or less than 10% ) are oosterhoff - intermediate .        in figure",

    ", it should be noted that the separation of the clusters into `` young halo '' and `` old halo '' groups by @xcite is somewhat artificial , since there is clearly significant overlap in turnoff ages between the two groups , as can be seen from figure  9 in @xcite : according to the quoted figure , the oldest `` young halo '' globular clusters are at least as old as the _ oldest _ `` old halo '' clusters , and likewise , the youngest `` old halo '' clusters have ages that are similar to those of the youngest `` young halo '' clusters .",

    "in fact , the presence of such peculiar abundance patterns , particularly a lowered abundance of the alpha - captured elements , has recently been viewed as a signature of a possible accretion origin ; the reader is referred to the recent spectroscopic study of ngc  5694 by @xcite for a recent example .",
    "note , on the other hand , that there are at least some outer - halo globular clusters with completely normal abundance patterns ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; see also footnote  [ foo : m5 ] below ) , thus suggesting that it is not only the inner galactic halo that contains globular clusters that formed `` in situ . '' on the other hand , @xcite have recently claimed that arp  2 and terzan  8which are also sagittarius globulars ",

    "* ) , recent surveys have revealed that at least some of them are also oosterhoff intermediate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and present unusual abundance patterns ( frebel et al .",

    "most of the recent evidence suggests that , even though we seem to be witnessing mergers between dsph satellite galaxies and our own galaxy `` in real time '' ( e.g. , sagittarius , cma ) , these are not truly representative of the events that led to the formation of the milky way , and only a relatively minor fraction of the galactic halo may have been assembled from dsph - like protogalactic fragments resembling the present - day milky way dsph satellites ( see also * ? ? ? * for a recent discussion ) .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the `` young '' second - parameter globular clusters in our galaxy ( as well as at least some of the milky way dsph satellites ) were accreted from m31 when the latter was forming its population  ii stars @xcite . given that our galaxy s globular clusters clearly present the oosterhoff dichotomy , but not so its dsph satellite galaxies",
    ", the question naturally presents itself : how does m31 classify , in terms of oosterhoff status ?",
    "of course , this is a very difficult question to answer , given that the detection of rr lyrae variable stars at the distance of m31 is very difficult from the ground .",
    "it was originally attempted by @xcite using the cfh 3.6 m telescope .",
    "these authors claimed the detection of 30 probable rr lyrae stars in their surveyed field , thus suggesting that the m31 halo has a specific frequency of rr lyrae variables comparable to that in rr lyrae - rich galactic globular clusters .",
    "they also reported a mean period for the ab - type variables of @xmath212  d , thus classifying the m31 halo field as ooi .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a variability survey , using the wiyn 3.5 m telescope , of an m31 halo field that includes the @xcite field , finding a specific frequency of rr lyrae variables dramatically lower than in the @xcite study . using time - series observations with acs onboard the _ hst _ ,",
    "@xcite have shown that , in fact , the specific rr lyrae frequency of the m31 halo is intermediate between the two quoted studies .",
    "interestingly , they also find a @xmath213  d , which corresponds to the oosterhoff - intermediate domain in figure  [ fig : oo ] . on the other hand , as we have seen ,",
    "the dsph satellites of the milky way are indeed almost exclusively oosterhoff - intermediate  and so are probably the dsph satellites of m31 as well @xcite .",
    "therefore , the incorporation of dsph satellites from the m31 system into our own galaxy s would not fundamentally change the stellar pulsation properties of the milky way s dsph system .    to be sure , extensive variability surveys of not only the m31 halo field and its dwarf satellite galaxies , but also ( and most challenging of all ) of its _ globular clusters _",
    ", are badly needed to place constraints on its old halo s ( and indeed , as we have just seen , the whole local group s ) formation history .",
    "it would be very important to establish whether the oosterhoff dichotomy is present in the m31 globulars , as well as in m31 s general field , since this would enable a systematic comparison between the very oldest stars in the m31 dsph satellites and their peers in the general m31 halo , thus posing constraints on the extent to which the latter may have been assembled from `` building blocks '' similar to the former .",
    "unfortunately , such studies have so far remained rather limited @xcite , given that they require expensive time - series observations from space .",
    "ground - based surveys could in principle be carried out using large telescopes equipped with adaptive optics instruments , but unfortunately , this technique remains limited to near - infrared observations  a wavelength regime where not only the red giants are brightest but also the amplitudes of rr lyrae stars are smallest ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus making their detection hardest .",
    "the _ second parameter problem _ of globular cluster astronomy is commonly defined as the existence of globular clusters with very similar metallicity ( the  first parameter  ; * ? ? ?",

    "it appears to have been first noted by @xcite ( see pages 607 and 608 in their paper ) , and later also by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has now been recognized to exist also in the m31 halo @xcite , as well as in the fornax dsph galaxy @xcite .",

    "the spectroscopic results by @xcite do not rule out a @xmath216 for these cooler stars ( but note again that proper inclusion of stellar winds might bring the derived gravities up , and therefore the required @xmath215 values down ) , but appear inconsistent with a @xmath217 or higher ( see their fig .",

    "note that the high helium abundance suggested for blue hb stars in ngc  2808 could also be constrained in this way , since @xcite suggest that even the cooler blue hb stars in this cluster have helium abundances as high as @xmath218 , which should leave an obvious mark in the @xmath214 plane ( fig .",

    "no such detailed calculations have been carried out yet .",
    "accordingly , it remains unclear whether models with an _ overall _ enhancement in all metals to super - solar levels ( which is not what the quoted abundance studies indicate ) , as commonly employed in the literature , are adequate to derive gravities of stars hotter than the grundahl jump .",
    "the influence of the `` first parameter '' ( metallicity ) upon hb morphology can be summarized as the observed trend of hb type getting redder as metallicity increases @xcite . , which also favors the production of redder hb types at higher @xmath220 .",

    "the reason for such a reversal of trend is not entirely clear ; while some have suggested that it could be due to a decrease in mass loss eficiency as metallicity decreases @xcite , others have suggested instead that a majority of the metal - poor globulars may in fact be somewhat _ younger _ than galactic globular clusters of intermediate metallicity @xcite . according to the isochrones shown in figure  [ fig : hbr ]",

    "the essence of this method is that the hb of ngc  1851 looks very similar to the sum of the ngc  288 and ngc  362 hbs , so that , by carefully superposing the latter cmds with that for ngc  1851 , the relative positions of their turnoffs  and hence their relative ages  can be derived . in the cluster",

    "therefore , it appears fair to say that , in the @xcite scale , this pair is indeed consistent with age as the sole second parameter .    on the other hand ,",

    "is it that consistency with the relative turnoff age difference is recovered , irrespective of the mass loss formulation used . for ages higher than 10  gyr ,",
    "several mass loss formulae lead to results that allow one to question the hypothesis that age is the ( only ) second parameter for this pair .",

    "therefore , we conclude that it is more difficult to account for the pair ngc  288/ngc  362 entirely in terms of age if the @xcite scale better describes the actual abundances of globular cluster stars",

    "if so , figure  [ fig:288362 ] clearly shows that age can not be the ( sole ) second parameter for this pair .",
    "this pair was first seriously and quantitatively considered in the context of the second - parameter phenomenon by @xcite , who suggested that the age difference required to account for the difference in hb type between m3 ( uniformly populated hb ) and m13 ( blue hb with a long blue tail ) exceeded the constraints from turnoff stars .",
    "a similar conclusion was later reached by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have reanalyzed the problem , incorporating the @xcite mass loss `` law '' into their analysis , and finding an age difference of @xmath227  gyr between the two clusters  which , according to them , `` can produce the difference in hb morphology between the clusters . ''",
    "here we revisit the problem , investigating the impact of the several different mass loss formulae for red giant stars summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : dm ] .",
    "first we proceed to compute synthetic hb models using the global sample of m3 hb stars discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and assuming the canonical metallicity for the pair ",
    "namely , @xmath222 . for m13",
    ", we have retrieved the _",
    "photometry from @xcite and performed number counts along the hb of the cluster .",
    "when we attempted to reproduce the observed m13 hb morphology in terms of canonical synthetic hbs , we quickly arrived at the conclusion that a unimodal distribution was inadequate , since it was unable to explain the large number of very low - mass stars at the extreme hot end of the m13 hb .",
    "therefore , we incorporated a second , low - mass mode to our simulations , thus obtaining a much better agreement with the overall hb morphology of the cluster .",
    "it should be noted that the ehb of the cluster is extremely populous , containing about 30% of all hb stars in m13 .",
    "we then computed the average total mass loss required to explain the derived masses of the hb stars for each mass loss formula in table  [ tb : dm ] and over a range in ages , which then allowed us to compute the age difference that was needed , with respect to m3 , to account for the observed difference in hb type .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : m3m13ehb ] . in the upper plot",
    ", we compare the theoretical results with the empirical age difference for the pair , as recently derived by @xcite .",
    "( unless otherwise stated , in this section we use the @xcite results obtained in the @xcite @xcite scale . ) in the lower plot , the same theoretical results are compared with the age difference derived by @xcite .",
    "we have also compared the model results with the @xcite age difference values , but these are intermediate between the other two studies so that we omit further discussion of this case in what follows .",
    "note , in addition , that , within the errors , @xcite and @xcite find m13 and m3 to be essentially coeval , whereas @xcite claims that m13 may even have the younger turnoff of the two ( see below ) .",
    "@xcite provides an impressive comparison between the two clusters in the strmgren @xmath10 , @xmath228 plane ( his fig .  2 ,",
    "left panel ) , where one can clearly see that there is not much room for a significant age difference between the two clusters@xcite himself finding an age difference of only @xmath229  gyr between m13 and m3 , the former being older .",
    "as can clearly be seen , the required age difference appears too large in comparison with the @xcite age difference measurements , irrespective of the mass loss formula used .",
    "the larger age difference measured by @xcite , on the other hand , may be compatible with the turnoff age difference , particularly for lower m3 ages and if the `` goldberg '' formula provides a less reliable description of mass loss rates on the rgb than do the others .",
    "some authors have suggested , on the other hand , that the origin of ehb stars may not be directly linked to the age of a globular cluster , being more likely instead to be due to other physical processes , including helium enrichment , binarity , and any other processes that may trigger enhanced mass loss on the rgb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if so , it follows that at least 30% of the hb stars in m13 do not owe their present - day color to age , a different second parameter being required .",
    "in fact , @xcite favor this option , although this is in conflict with the scenario of @xcite and @xcite for the origin of the `` uv upturn phenomenon '' and for the photometric evolution of galaxies , according to which even the hottest hb stars owe their existence to age ( high ages naturally being implied for giant elliptical galaxies in this case ) . note that this age scenario forms the basis upon which the recently measured galex ultraviolet spectra of early - type galaxies and extragalactic globular clusters is currently being interpreted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , in our own galaxy ehb stars are now known to be present even in _ open _",
    "clusters @xcite , again reinforcing the impression that old ages can not be solely responsible for the origin of ehb stars  and hence suggesting that age evolution alone can not fully account for the uv upturn phenomenon and for the evolution of the photometric properties of galaxies as a function of redshift .    to check whether the pair m13/m3 might be explained by assuming a completely different formation channel for the m13 ehb stars",
    ", we have repeated the above exercise but now _ removing _ all m13 ehb stars from the sample .",
    "since there are so many ehb stars in the cluster , this clearly leads to a significantly higher mean mass for the m13 hb stars , and therefore to a smaller expected age difference between this cluster and m3 .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : m3m13 ] confirms that , if one admits that the ehb stars owe their origin to a different physical process , one is able to account for the different hb types of m13 and m3 entirely in terms of the reported turnoff age differences , irrespective of the adopted mass loss recipe , provided ( in the * ? ? ?",
    "* case ) m3 is younger than 12  gyr .",
    "more stringent constraints on the m3 absolute age would derive in the case of using the @xcite results for the ( lack of a ) dependence of rgb mass loss rate on @xmath21 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 .    finally , it is important to note that , according to @xcite s ( @xcite ) report on ultra - precise photometry for m13 and m3 obtained with the cfht , _ the intrinsic position of the turnoff point in m13 is actually bluer than in m3 _ , which is of course completely unexpected if the former is indeed older than the latter .",
    "the author strongly argues that there are very few ( if any ) sources of systematic errors that could have led him to underestimate the turnoff color for m13 compared to m3 in his study .",
    "one might suspect reddening uncertainties to be the culprit , but it should be noted that both clusters have very low reddening : the feb",
    ".  2003 edition of the @xcite catalog lists reddening values @xmath230  mag and 0.01  mag for m13 and m3 , respectively ( the same values as used by @xcite ) . from @xcite s study , one finds that , for both clusters to have the same turnoff color ( and hence the _ same _ ages ) , the relative reddenings of the two clusters , compared with the @xcite catalog value , would have to be incorrect by @xmath231  mag , which amounts to @xmath232  mag according to the @xcite standard extinction law  in the sense that the m13 reddening must have been overestimated , and/or the m3 reddening underestimated .",
    "while this may seem like a small change , it is worth noting that , on the basis of the @xcite dust maps , one finds @xmath233  mag for m13 , and @xmath234  mag for m3 : while the shifts are correct in sign , they are clearly insufficient in size to bring m13 to even the same turnoff age as m3 .",
    "an even larger change would be needed , of course , to make m13 significantly older than m3 .",
    "@xcite argues , in fact , that a more likely explanation for the differences in cmd positions _ and shapes _ between the two clusters would be provided by a difference in helium abundance , as has indeed been suggested by other authors as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". even stronger constraints on the relative reddening values between the two clusters would certainly prove helpful in clarifying the situation .",
    "it is worth revisiting the case of the outer halo globular clusters with predominantly red hb types which have had their ages measured with _",
    ", such as palomar  3 , palomar  4 , and eridanus .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , these clusters are slightly younger than the bulk of galactic globular clusters with similar metallicity .",
    "is the detected age difference between these clusters and inner halo clusters , such as m3 and m5 , ] consistent with the observed difference in hb morphology between them ?    in terms of metallicity , pal  3 provides a good match to m3 .",
    "accordingly , @xcite performed a study of the age difference between pal  3 and m3 that is required to account for their relative hb types , and found that the age difference based on analyses of the turnoff points could easily account for the difference in mean hb color between the two clusters .",
    "we have repeated their exercise , finding a slightly larger age difference being needed to account for their different hb types , but basically confirming their results . on the other hand , @xcite call attention to the fact that the mass dispersion along the hb of pal  3 appears entirely consistent with zero , thus being significantly different from m3 s .",
    "if differences in mass loss among individual red giants is responsible for the presence of mass dispersion along the hbs of globular clusters , then the mass loss process clearly operated in a different way in pal  3 than it did in m3 .",
    "accordingly , @xcite suggest that while age may be the `` global '' second parameter driving the _",
    "mean _ hb color for at least some globular clusters , for many globular clusters environmental effects might be a `` local '' second parameter responsible for generating a _ dispersion in color _ around this mean value .    in terms of chemical composition",
    ", both pal  4 and eridanus appear to have metallicities similar to m5 s .",
    "in addition , since pal  4 and eridanus appear to have similar chemical composition and cmd morphology but coarsely populated cmds , it seems reasonable to combine the data for the two and perform a single analysis of the `` pair '' comprised by m5 , on the one hand , and pal  4/eridanus , on the other @xcite .",
    "again , we repeat the analysis carried out by @xcite , but now comparing the theoretical results with the age differences derived on the basis of the turnoff points by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . the results are shown in figure  [ fig : m5p4 ] , where the upper panel shows the comparison between the hb morphology - based analysis and the turnoff age difference from @xcite and @xcite , whereas the lower panel shows a comparison between the same results for the hb stars in these clusters and the turnoff ages from @xcite .",
    "these plots ( which again give slightly higher hb type - based age differences between the clusters than originally reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveal that the turnoff age difference measured by @xcite and @xcite is insufficient to account for the difference in hb types between m5 and pal  4/eridanus , irrespective of the mass loss formula used . on the other hand ,",
    "the turnoff age difference reported by @xcite is clearly more consistent with the hypothesis that the age difference between m5 and pal  4/eridanus is sufficient to account for their relative hb types .",
    "it is clearly very important to establish what the actual turnoff age difference between m5 and pal  4/eridanus is before we are in a position to decide whether age can be the ( `` global '' ) second parameter for this pair .",
    "while the second - parameter problem is traditionally thought to affect mostly intermediate - metallicity globular clusters , the fairly recent discovery of large ( and peculiarly bright ) rr lyrae populations @xcite and prominent blue hb tails @xcite in the moderately metal - rich galactic globular clusters ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 has brought the phenomenon to the realm of @xmath201 } \\sim -0.5 $ ] globular clusters as well .",
    "several hypotheses have been discussed in the literature to explain the observed hb morphology and peculiar rr lyrae periods in these clusters .",
    "these include tidal collisions @xcite , helium mixing on the rgb , a primordially increased helium abundance , and increased core masses at the rgb tip as a result of internal rotation @xcite .",
    "other explanations include a large spread in metallicities @xcite , a selective metal depletion scenario @xcite , and a range in internal helium abundances @xcite .",
    "in addition , and also as an attempt to explain their peculiar hb morphologies , @xcite have suggested that ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 might be similar to @xmath59  cen in nature , with a ( small ) internal metallicity spread and a ( fairly large ) internal range in ages ; in their scenario , the blue hb and bright rr lyrae components of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 would be ascribed to a combination of lower metallicity and old ages , rr lyrae stars being somewhat more metal - poor stars evolved away from a position on the blue zahb .",
    "unfortunately , most  if not all  of these scenarios face strict observational and theoretical constraints .",
    "@xcite show that tidal collisions can not produce the observed hb morphology  and we add that it can not lead to peculiarly bright rr lyrae stars , either .",
    "a primordially increased helium abundance does not appear consistent with the position of the rgb bump in these clusters @xcite . a large spread in metallicities ,",
    "as also pointed out by @xcite , is not supported by observations of the cluster cmds in the rgb region , since the latter do not show the large spread in colors that would be expected in this case .",
    "moreover , @xcite have recently found , based on vlt spectra , only a small ( though significant ) spread in [ fe / h ] among the rr lyrae stars in ngc  6441although this result could not be confirmed by @xcite among the cluster s red giants .",
    "evolution away from a position on the blue zahb does not produce enough bright rr lyrae variables to explain the observed rr lyrae period distributions , and neither is the sloping nature of the hb quantitatively reproduced in the @xcite scenario @xcite .",
    "most puzzling of all is the evidence that the blue hb stars in these clusters cooler than the @xcite jump do _ not _ appear to have peculiarly low gravities @xcite , which effectively rules out any scenario that requires the blue hb and rr lyrae components to be brighter than in canonical models .",
    "however , a brighter hb at both the blue hb and the rr lyrae levels seem to be required by i )  the glaring evidence that the tip of the blue hb is @xmath235  mag brighter in @xmath0 than the red hb component ; ii )  the very long periods of the rr lyrae stars in both clusters . given the apparently irreconcilable evidence , we suggest that a reassessment of the spectroscopic gravities for a larger sample of blue hb stars in both clusters would prove well worth the effort .    assuming that the spectroscopic gravities can indeed be reconciled with the requirement that the blue hb component be unusually bright , we discuss the possibility that a internal spread in helium abundances @xcite may help account for the hb morphology and rr lyrae pulsation properties in these clusters ( see * ? ? ? * for numerical simulations in the case of helium mixing ) .",
    "consider the case of ngc  2808 , and assume that , as suggested by @xcite , there is an internal helium abundance range among the stars in the cluster . in their scenario , ngc  2808 s red hb and rr lyrae components have a `` normal '' helium abundance , blue hb stars at the `` horizontal '' level have a mild helium enhancement , and hotter blue hb stars have a much higher ( initial ) helium content , up to about 35% .",
    "@xcite suggest a similar scenario for the cluster , only invoking an even higher helium enhancement for the blue hb stars .",
    "now imagine how ngc  2808 might have looked like in the not too remote past ( say , a couple of gyr ago ) : its present - day helium - enhanced blue hb stars would necessarily be redder as a consequence of the younger age , and therefore _ helium - enhanced stars would be present in relatively high numbers inside the rr lyrae instability strip_thus leading to overluminous , long - period rr lyrae stars . the stars at the tip of the blue hb would have an even higher helium abundance , leading to a marked _ sloping hb _ when compared with the red hb and rr lyrae components in the same cluster .",
    "clearly , the ngc  2808 envisaged by @xcite and @xcite would have looked a lot like the present - day ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 in the past !",
    "accordingly , a possible explanation for the observed peculiarities in these clusters could involve both an enhanced helium abundance among a fraction of the cluster stars ( note that the blue hb plus rr lyrae components in both clusters constitute relatively small fractions of the overall hb populations , so that the rgb bump constraint might not be violated in this case ) and a younger age with respect to the bulk of the galactic globular clusters  the latter not necessarily being required , depending on metallicity ( i.e. , first parameter ) and mass loss effects : indeed , the deep hst photometry presented by @xcite for ngc  6388 reveals that the cluster is comparable in age to 47  tuc .",
    "a potential problem with this scenario is the fact that , for every single helium abundance value , one should expect , by analogy with what is observed in `` single - population globular clusters , '' a spread in mass loss as well .",
    "therefore , at any given color , a spread in helium abundance should also be present , and it is unclear whether the implied hb luminosity distribution would match in detail the observed one , which appears fairly tight .",
    "this problem is especially evident in the recent simulated cmd by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see their fig .",
    "7 ) , but is not as apparent in the simulated cmds of @xcite  which again may be due to the lack of a mass spread for the populations with enhanced @xmath215 in their simulations .",
    "note , in this sense , that the simulations presented by @xcite in their helium mixing and rotation scenarios also ignore the effect of a spread in masses for each individual @xmath215 . in any case",
    ", @xcite has recently reported that ngc  6388 does show a double subgiant branch , thus reinforcing the evidence for the presence of more than one stellar population in the cluster .",
    "we conclude that stringent tests of such a scenario could be provided by deep _",
    "hst _ photometry ( so that the turnoff ages , and possible splits indicative of multiple stellar populations , can be reliably established ) , spectroscopic gravities for a large sample of moderately cool blue hb stars in both clusters , and hb simulations in which both a spread in @xmath215 and in rgb mass loss are simultaneously taken into account .",
    "much has been written over the past several years in regard to the luminosities of hb stars at the rr lyrae level , particularly in the @xmath0 band , and its dependence on metallicity ; recent reviews of the subject include papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "therefore , it could be significantly brighter ( or fainter ) than the average field rr lyrae at the same metallicity , in which case our results could be _ systematically _ off by 0.1  mag or more , given the intrinsic spread in rr lyrae luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite have recently argued , based on strmgren photometry and theoretical modelling , that rr lyr may be brighter than other field rr lyrae stars of similar metallicity by @xmath289  mag in @xmath0 , whereas @xcite , comparing distances derived using type ii cepheids and rr lyrae stars , similarly advocate that rr lyr is overluminous by @xmath290  mag in @xmath0 .",

    "the interested reader is referred to the recent reviews by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for critical discussions of several of the more salient uncertainties affecting the computation of hb models .",
    "one of the main ingredients affecting the luminosity level of hb stars are the _ conductive opacities _ in the cores of their progenitor rgb stars .",
    "the cores of rgb stars are electron - degenerate , so that electron conduction is the main form of energy transport .",
    "naturally , the more efficient the transport of energy away from the he - core , the more difficult it becomes for the core to reach high enough temperatures for the onset of helium burning , with the end result that the he - flash is delayed for higher electron conductivities ( i.e. , smaller conductive opacities ) , the star reaching a higher he - core mass and a brighter location on the rgb tip  thus also being expected to lose more mass during its first ascent of the rgb and thereby settle on a bluer post - flash location on the zahb .",

    "most importantly , higher @xmath313 values lead to brighter hbs as    @xmath314    ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) ; therefore , an uncertainty in the value of @xmath313 by only @xmath315 ( or about @xmath316 ) is capable of affecting the hb luminosity level by @xmath317  mag .",
    "the numerical experiments by @xcite indicate that a change in @xmath313 by about @xmath318 obtains when one reduces the conductive opacities used in their calculations by a ( uniform ) factor of 2 .",
    "the implied level of uncertainty in the hb models is important not only for the sake of comparing the predicted and empirically calibrated hb luminosity - metallicity relationships , but also ( and perhaps most importantly ) in the context of the self - consistent determination of globular cluster ages from evolutionary models of globular cluster stars ; of the establishment of the rgb tip distance scale ; of the determination of the helium abundance in globular clusters using iben s ( 1968 ) @xmath52-method ; and of the placement of astrophysical constraints on fundamental ( especially particle ) physics parameters . as to the latter ,",

    "@xcite do note that coulomb logarithms in the transition domain from weak ( @xmath331 ) to strong ( @xmath332 ) ion coupling could be calculated using the @xcite formalism , but unfortunately such a formalism was not applied in their calculations .",
    "in fact , it appears that the reason why such a range of @xmath327 values has not been given great emphasis in such calculations as those by @xcite or @xcite is that such studies are generally carried out primarily with applications to the more extreme conditions characterizing neutron stars and white dwarf cores in mind , the interiors of rgb stars having received comparatively little attention .    , but for the ratio between actual temperature and the fermi temperature in the rgb core .",
    "[ fig : fermi ] ]    this , in fact , also brings to mind the question whether other approximations to physical situations that are rather more extreme in neutron stars and white dwarf cores may not have been adopted in these latest calculations that could render uncertain their application to the conditions characterizing rgb cores . in this sense ,",
    "the most obvious ingredient is the _ electron degeneracy level_. figure  [ fig : fermi ] shows the run of the ratio between the actual temperature and the fermi temperature for the same models shown in the previous plots . as well known , for @xmath333 , strong degeneracy is present , whereas @xmath334 implies a classical regime where degeneracy effects are unimportant .",
    "this plot indicates that rgb interiors fall in an intermediate regime between strongly degenerate and classical . in other words ,",
    "_ partial degeneracy _",
    "better describes the status of the rgb interior .",
    "note , in particular , that at the mass coordinate where the he - flash takes place , the temperature ranges from about 10% to 45% the fermi temperature .",
    "clearly , the effects of partial degeneracy should be fully taken into account for conductive opacities that are applicable to the conditions characterizing rgb cores to obtain .",
    "how does this compare with the @xcite and @xcite analyses ?",
    "as clearly stated by @xcite , their analysis `` is limited by the condition @xmath333''in other words , strong degeneracy is assumed in their calculations . unfortunately , this can not be expected to provide particularly reliable results for the rgb interior .",
    "the above discussion refers to the contribution of electron - ion ( _ ei _ ) interactions to the conductive opacity .",
    "an apparently more subtle effect is related to the _ electron - electron ( ee ) interactions_. since these are usually of little importance in the more extreme conditions characterizing neutron stars and white dwarfs , the @xcite and @xcite calculations have not treated this component in as much detail as in the case of the _ ei _ interactions .",
    "component was indeed computed assuming complete degeneracy , with no corrections whatsoever due to partial degeneracy effects  and are accordingly expected to be accurate only to within a factor of @xmath206 ( potekhin 2005 , priv .",
    "however , it must be noted that _",
    "ee _ effects are a _",
    "major _ component of the conductive opacity in a he plasma in the conditions characterizing the rgb interior @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : ee ] , where the ratio between the component of the conductive opacity due to _ ee _ interactions and the total conductive opacity , according to the @xcite calculations , is displayed .",
    "one sees that the _ ee _ contribution reaches a _ minimum _ of about 28% of the total conductive opacity close to the mass coordinate where the he - flash takes place .",
    "ee _ contribution increases further as the he - flash is approached .",
    "evidently , an error by a factor of two in the _ ee _ contribution to the conductive opacity implies that the total opacity is uncertain by a comparable factor .",
    "accordingly , greater attention should be devoted to this crucial physical ingredient in future calculations of conductive opacities for rgb stars .",
    "it is obviously of great interest to check how the @xcite and @xcite opacities compare with experiments conducted in the laboratory .",
    "such a comparison , in the case of electrical conduction , has recently been carried out by @xcite , using laboratory data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "their results are shown in figure  [ fig : lab ] , where the electrical conductivity is plotted as a function of the coulomb @xmath327 parameter .",
    "these comparisons clearly reveal a very complex pattern , with the models systematically overestimating the conductivity ( i.e. , underestimating the conductive opacity ) for @xmath335 ; presenting good agreement with the empirical results for @xmath336 ; and again overestimating the conductivity for @xmath337 .",
    "it is unclear at present what the reasons for this behavior are , though potekhin ( 2005 , priv .",
    "comm . ) points out that the laboratory plasmas , when heavy elements are present ( the above experiments were carried out using xenon and aluminum ) , are almost always partially ionized , and it is very difficult to determine , and therefore account for , the actual degree of ionization , because of the plasma nonideality .",
    "accordingly , more empirical tests of the @xcite results using low-@xmath220 gases , especially he , would be highly desirable .",
    "it is instructive to compare the @xcite and @xcite results with those from the @xcite and @xcite analyses .",
    "this is done in figures  [ fig : ip ] and [ fig : hlp ] , respectively , which show the relative differences between the conductive opacities computed by @xcite and by @xcite with respect to the @xcite results for the physical conditions characterizing the rgb interior calculations . in the @xcite case",
    ", we have included the quantum corrections by @xcite , which however are rather small over the region of interest .",
    "the agreement between the itoh - mitake prescriptions and @xcite s is quite poor , with the former systematically overestimating the conductive opacity except very close to the core , where the conductive opacity is instead underestimated by about 25% . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xcite calculations reveal a better agreement with the @xcite results , the maximum overestimate of the conductive opacity by @xcite compared to @xcite not exceeding about 55% . in the central core , again the older calculations underestimate the conductive opacity compared to the more recent results , albeit by a maximum of less than 20% .",
    "we conclude that the @xcite results are in much better agreement with the canonical prescriptions by @xcite than they are with the results by @xcite .    while updated conductive opacities that are entirely suitable for the conditions characterizing rgb interiors are not available , it is clear that one should avoid using the @xcite results in calculations of low - mass stellar evolution .",
    "after the first version of this paper had been completed , new conductive opacities were published by @xcite  in essence , a revised and updated installment of the @xcite opacities .",
    "these calculations , while still not perfect , already do take several of the shortcomings noted in the previous sections into due account , and should accordingly be strongly preferred in state - of - the - art evolutionary computations .",
    " 2.4 , and especially figures  3 and 4 , in @xcite provide the results of a comparison between the new conductive opacities computed by @xcite and the earlier studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "important differences are found with respect to the results from all previous studies , especially those from the @xcite team . according to @xcite ,",
    "the differences are mainly due to the following : i )  deficiencies in the earlier treatment of strongly coupled and relativistic plasmas ( @xcite ) ; ii )  an inadequate extension towards the @xmath338 regime ( @xcite ) ; iii )  a neglect of _ ee _ scattering ( @xcite ) .",
    "when the new conductive opacities are used in evolutionary computations , @xcite find that the changes , with respect to the results based on the earlier @xcite prescriptions , to be relatively modest .",
    "more specifically , they find : i )  a reduction in the core mass at the he - flash by about @xmath339 , irrespective of metallicity ; ii )  an increase in @xmath340 at the rr lyrae level , by an amount ranging from 0.06  mag at @xmath341 down to 0.04  mag at solar metallicity ; iii )  an increase in the hb lifetime , by about 5 - 6% . while relatively small , these systematic effects must obviously be properly taken into account in future precision studies involving hb stars .",
    "the study of horizontal branch stars encompasses and/or has direct implications for many different branches of astrophysics . without first looking into several of these areas",
    ", one might rush into the conclusion that the study of hb stars is a frustratingly limited affair .",
    "nothing could be farther from the truth .",
    "as we have seen , in order to properly understand hb stars and appreciate their astrophysical implications , one must dwell on the physical processes ( both canonical and non - canonical ) that control the helium core flash in rgb stars ; the physical processes that lead to mass loss in rgb stars ; whether ( and how ) deep mixing takes place in rgb stars , both before and during the helium flash ; how angular momentum evolves with time in low - mass stars ; where , and how fast , radiative levitation and diffusion effects in moderately high - gravity stars `` kick in '' ; how dramatically non - solar abundance ratios ( again as a result of radiative levitation and gravitational settling ) may affect model atmospheres and the photon output as a function of wavelength ; how both radial and non - radial ( both p and g ) pulsation modes can be excited , and then evolve with time ; how theory and observations of radial pulsators may place constraints on the physical parameters of stars , and thereby help determine the formation history of galaxies and the extragalactic distance scale ; how asteroseismology of non - radial pulsators may help reveal the interior structure and thereby constrain the evolutionary history of stars ; how the ultraviolet flux from giant elliptical galaxies and bulges of spirals come to being ; how the stellar populations of resolved and unresolved galaxies evolve with time ; and so on and so forth . in summary ,",
    "the study of hb stars is a challenging and far - reaching intellectual adventure , and we hope that the present review will have helped unveil some of the reasons why this is so .",
