    "despite the spectacular success of quantum mechanics as a fundamental theory and as a superb calculational tool for all modern physics , the scientific literature continuously carries a substantial number of papers devoted to the foundations and the interpretation of the theory .",
    "the introduction of probability in the sense used in quantum mechanics has been the key issue of debates . since its early days the probabilistic interpretation of quantum phenomena has had its opponents , and einstein in a letter to born expressed the view @xcite :    0.3 cm _ the theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the old one .",
    "i am at all events convinced that _ he _ does not play dice . _ 0.3 cm    this statement is the best known example of the open criticism of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics .    in his fundamental paper devoted to the quantum theory of spontaneous and stimulated processes by radiation",
    ", einstein expressed his well - known discomfort about the probabilistic description of spontaneous emission in the following words @xcite : 0.3 cm _ the weakness of the theory lies on the one hand in the fact that it does not get us any closer to making the connection with wave theory ; on the other hand , that it leaves the duration and direction of the elementary process to chance. _ 0.3 cm    in making the connection between waves and particles , einstein noted that the emission of radiation ( outgoing radiation ) is directional . in the same paper he wrote :    0.3 cm _ outgoing radiation in the form of spherical waves does not exist . _",
    "0.3 cm    in the early 1920 s , einstein , in his unpublished speculations , proposed the idea of a `` gespensterfeld '' or a ghost field which determines the probability for a light - quantum to take a definite path . in these speculations ,",
    "the ghost field gives the relation between a wave field and a light - quantum by triggering the elementary process of spontaneous emission .",
    "the directionality of the elementary process is fully described by the will ( dynamical properties ) of the ghost field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics as developed by born has been considerably influenced by the idea of the ghost field @xcite . born realized that unlike the electromagnetic field , the schrdinger wave function @xmath1 has no direct physical reality .",
    "only if one interprets @xmath2 or the ghost field as a real probability , do all the weaknesses of the interpretation disappear because : @xmath3    in a paper presented at oxford , born expressed the opinion that @xcite : 0.3 cm    _ but , of course , anybody dissatisfied with these ideas may feel free to assume that there are additional parameters not yet introduced into the theory which determine the individual event .",
    "_ 0.3 cm    these additional parameters called , accordingly , hidden variables and denoted by @xmath4 , have been introduced in order to remove from quantum mechanics the indeterminacy introduced by the born interpretation of the wave function . according to hidden variables theories ,",
    "all physical observables such as , for example the position and the momentum of a particle , the spin or the electric field are entirely deterministic , i.e , are objective realities given by functions @xmath5 . due to the assumed unobservable nature of the hidden parameters @xmath4 , only the following average    @xmath6",
    "can be measured in realistic experimental situations .",
    "the distribution of the as yet undiscovered hidden variables is positive ( a well - behaved probability distribution ) and normalized    @xmath7    in this interpretation the hidden parameters would be equivalent to a ghost field of some yet undisclosed nature , i.e. , @xmath8    in 1935 , einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) published their famous paper @xcite in which they argued that : 0.3 cm _ the wave function @xmath1 does not provide a complete description of physical reality . _",
    "0.3 cm    the need for a revision of the interpretation of the wave function was strongly expressed in this paper .",
    "in fact , epr questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics , analyzing a correlated system of two particles .",
    "the epr arguments can be best summarized in bohm s version @xcite which uses two correlated spin-@xmath0 particles as the epr physical system .",
    "let us consider an initial physical system consisting of two distinguishable spin-@xmath0 particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 in a spin-@xmath11 quantum state ( a spin singlet state ) .",
    "this system dissociates to a pair of spatially separated spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "let assume that the dissociation process conserves the total spin of the system and that the separated particles are now moving to opposite stern - gerlach detectors ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in the framework of quantum mechanics",
    "the bohm singlet wave function corresponding to the epr dissociating system of two spin-@xmath12 particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 is : @xmath13 are the two eigenstates of the pauli matrix @xmath14 ( quantum operators are denoted with carets ) corresponding to the two eigenvalues @xmath15 and @xmath16 . after the dissociation the particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 move to opposite directions without ever being disturbed in any way and various spin components of each of these particles may by measured independently .    the particle @xmath9 is detected by a stern - gerlach apparatus which can be oriented along directions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 respectively . the particle @xmath10 is detected by a stern - gerlach apparatus which can be oriented along the same three directions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the epr argument is based on the following observation involving such measurements .",
    "the stern - gerlach apparatus may record that the spin @xmath9 is parallel or antiparallel to @xmath17 , which one can take to be the z - axis .",
    "let us assume that it has been detected as parallel to @xmath17 meaning that we know that the value of the spin @xmath9 is @xmath21 .",
    "knowing that the spin of particle @xmath9 is @xmath15 , common sense based on an objective reality associated with the spin ( a singlet state consists of two antiparallel spins ) predicts that the second particle @xmath10 has its spin @xmath16 .",
    "this means that that the result of a measurement carried on the second particle by a stern - gerlach apparatus with the same orientation @xmath17 will predict an antiparallel spin .",
    "the same argument based on objective realities for spin variables can be repeated for the orientations @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the stern - gerlach apparatus leading to the conclusion that the values of the spin are known in the three directions which is in violation of quantum mechanical properties of pauli spin operators projected along @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "accordingly epr concluded that one should search for a deeper - lying theory in which the following two very important criteria are satisfied :    * * the reality criterion * : _ if without in any way disturbing the system , we can predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity . _ * * the locality criterion * : _ if at the time of measurement ... two systems no longer interact , no real change can take place in the second system in consequence of anything that may be done to the first system .",
    "_    the epr analysis of quantum correlations based on the reality and the locality criteria have led to apparently contradictory conclusions with quantum mechanics which do not allow for commuting objective realities associated with the spin observables .",
    "epr summarized their views in the following statement : 0.3 cm _ this simultaneous _ [ predictability ] _ makes the reality of _ [ the spins in bohm s version ] _ dependent upon the process of measurement carried out on the first system which does not disturb the second system in any way .",
    "no reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this .",
    "_ 0.3 cm    if the spin singlet wave function ( [ singlet ] ) of the two particles is measured by two stern - gerlach analyzers , in the directions given by unit vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the single detection of the spins is denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the joint simultaneous detection of the particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "these expectation values for this wave function ( [ singlet ] ) are given by the following formulas : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the projections of the three spin-@xmath12 pauli matrices of the particle @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the stern - gerlach apparatus orientations characterized by the unit vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts that for parallel detectors we have a perfect correlation : @xmath28 is @xmath29 and as a result we have with probability one that the eigenvalue of @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "this perfect correlation between these two measurements permits one to predict the outcome of the second measurement with probability * one * without ever disturbing the second system .    on other hand in the framework of hidden variables or an unknown ghost field these expectation values",
    "are given by the following expression @xcite :    @xmath32    in this formula @xmath33 describes a joint probability distribution of the ghost field characterized by the hidden variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the objective realities of the spin variables are given by the deterministic functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the locality assumption leads to the property that the distribution function of the ghost field is independent of the surrounding experimental setup and does not depend on what other observables are measured simultaneously on the same system .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to provide a quantum mechanical description of the ghost field . using different descriptions and formulations of quantum mechanics",
    ", we shall discuss the same epr correlation in different , though , equivalent forms of quantum theory . in short",
    ", we shall allow quantum mechanics to speak for itself on such issues as locality and the ghost field .",
    "we believe that letting quantum mechanics speak out via its different formulations can provide the most down - to - earth description of these fundamental and puzzling issues . as a result , our approach will be almost completely divorced from all of its philosophical or speculative aspects . instead of this , we shall focus our effort on the question : how can we make quantum mechanics look like a ghost field and vice versa ?",
    "these considerations demonstrate a much closer correspondence between the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics and hidden variables or ghost fields . in our approach we shall show that the wave function @xmath1 can always be replaced by a suitable quantum mechanical ghost field @xmath38 with properties that defy the epr concepts of objective realities or locality .",
    "@xmath39    expressing the formalism of quantum mechanics in a given and suitable form can provide a better understanding of the nature of the quantum mechanical ghost field . instead of being vague in most of such descriptions ,",
    "the formalism of quantum mechanics can provide a reasonable ( if not ideal ) description of quantum locality , reality , nonlocality and their interrelations .",
    "the concept of local realism as introduced by epr is based on the fundamental assumption that physical systems can be described by local objective properties that are independent of observation . starting with the epr article ,",
    "questions devoted to local realism , to measurements and the nonlocal character of quantum correlations , and to hidden variables have been raised , debated and analyzed both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "this debate has produced various alternative theories to quantum mechanics .",
    "these theories have been considered over the years , hidden variables theories being prominent among these .    from the theoretical point of view , a real breakthrough came after bell discovered@xcite in 1965 that certain classes of hidden variables theories limit the strength of spin or photon correlations and that quantum mechanical correlations are not constrained by these limits . these fundamental limitations or constrains inhibited by local realism lead to the famous bell inequality .",
    "for the purpose of proving the bell inequality we shall assume that stern - gerlach apparatuses for the two particles are oriented along the three directions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with angles @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    in order to prove the bell inequality we introduce",
    "( following cover @xcite ) the following quantity built from objective spin realities :    @xmath41    we shall restrict the range of these objective realities to @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the stern - gerlach apparatus . because the spins are antiparallel we have with certainty that :    @xmath44    for all the three orientations and for all the possible hidden variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 forming the ghost field that governs the statistical properties of the local objective realities representing the spin .",
    "this follows from the fact that if the first stern - gerlach apparatus oriented at @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 detects the spin direction to be @xmath29 , the second stern - gerlach apparatus oriented as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] has to detect the other spin of the singlet state ( [ singlet ] ) as @xmath31 .",
    "from the fact that the objective realities are bounded by @xmath29 we note that ( [ sigma ] ) reaches a minimum value : @xmath45 from the fact that the spins are antiparallel i.e. , ( [ perfect ] ) holds , we have the following inequality involving the objective realities : @xmath46 multiplying this inequality by @xmath47 , and integrating over the ghost field variables we obtain the following bell inequality : @xmath48 where we have used the fact that correlations are symmetric i.e. , for example @xmath49 .    in order to disprove a theory based on local objective realities a _ series _ of three of different correlation experiments is required ( in our case correlations @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath17 @xmath19 and @xmath18 @xmath19 ) .",
    "what we have seen in the process of deriving the bell inequality ( [ bell ] ) is that one could provide a much more accurate description of locality , local reality and correlations in terms of ( [ lhv ] ) .",
    "what is even more important in this inequality is the fact that all these ideas could be put to experimental verifications .",
    "for the three orientations from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the inequality ( [ bell ] ) reduces to @xmath50 and for the quantum correlation ( [ qepr ] ) we have : @xmath51 which is false and clearly violates the bell inequality ( [ bell ] ) for the spin-@xmath52 singlet state given by ( [ singlet ] ) .",
    "these inequalities have helped to put a large class of hidden variables theories to experimental tests @xcite .",
    "theories based on local realism have all failed these tests .",
    "so far , all the experiments involving correlations constrained by the bell s inequality have been positive for quantum mechanics and negative for various versions of local - realism @xcite .    if only one correlation experiment is performed the odds against objective realities are not very good .",
    "even if disproved in a series of three experiments , objective realities leave a puzzling question . if they come so close to the quantum predictions , perhaps there are some elements of truth in their descriptions given by ( [ lhv ] ) .",
    "if so , which particular assumptions of a local hidden variable theory are in agreement or disagreement with quantum mechanics . in order to answer such a question",
    ", we shall describe in the following sections , genuine quantum correlations in a form which bears a lot of similarities to the objective reality description .",
    "once quantum mechanics has been formulated in the form expressed by eq .",
    "( [ lhv ] ) a genuine effort can be made to address such issues as hidden variable objective realities and locality .",
    "once this relation is established , the question why quantum mechanics violates the bell inequality can be posed and investigated .",
    "the classical malus law predicts an attenuation of an incident polarized light beam with intensity @xmath53 , passing through a linear polarizer to obey @xmath54 .",
    "this attenuation depends on the relative angle @xmath55 between the polarization direction @xmath56 of the incoming wave and the orientation @xmath17 of the polarizer , i.e , @xmath57 .",
    "if the incoming light beam consists of a statistical mixture of polarized light , the incoming intensity is :    @xmath58    in this formula , the integration is over all possible angles of the random polarization direction @xmath56 and the classical distribution function @xmath59 characterizes the statistical properties of the incident light beam polarization .    in quantum mechanics",
    "a similar malus law holds for spin-@xmath0 particles detected by a stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "let assume that the spin of the particle @xmath9 is oriented along an arbitrary unit direction @xmath60 .",
    "the quantum expectation value of such a spin , if detected by the stern - gerlach apparatus oriented in the direction @xmath17 is : @xmath61 in this expression @xmath62 is the relative angle between the orientation of the detected spin state @xmath63 and the stern - gerlach apparatus @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding expectation value of the spin-@xmath0 projection operator @xmath65 is : @xmath66 is just the quantum version of the malus law for spin .",
    "light ( [ malus ] ) and spin-@xmath0 ( [ malus2 ] ) differ in this formulation by a factor @xmath0 in the relative angle involved in the malus law .    following the classical malus law for an unpolarized light beam ( [ malus ] ) , one can write the following quantum spin correlation function for an arbitrary quantum state of the two spin-@xmath0 particles detected by the stern - gerlach apparatus : @xmath67 where the distribution function @xmath68 describes the quantum mechanical ghost field for an arbitrary state @xmath69 of the two spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "this quantum mechanical expectation value ( [ qmalus ] ) has a remarkable similarity to the hidden variable equation ( [ lhv ] ) if the following correspondence is made @xcite : @xmath70 i.e. , the @xmath71 and @xmath72 are now the directional cosine functions between the directions of the polarizers @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the `` hidden - variable '' directions @xmath73 and @xmath74 averaged with respect to a local , i.e. , stern - gerlach apparatus independent ghost field @xmath75 .",
    "it is then clear that the quantum mechanical formula ( [ qmalus ] ) has the form of a hidden variable theory with the local spin realities given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and with a local ghost field represented by the distribution @xmath78 .    for the epr correlated system of the two spin-@xmath0 systems ,",
    "it is natural just to take the probability distribution in the form : @xmath79 where the two - dimensional dirac delta function indicates that the direction @xmath60 is antiparallel to the direction @xmath80 ie .",
    ", @xmath81 .",
    "the marginal properties of this distribution represent just an isotropic uniform distribution of the spin directions on the sphere : @xmath82    from these relations we conclude that individual ghost fields of the spins correspond to a uniform distribution of orientations .",
    "this leads to single spin averages equal to zero , i.e. , : @xmath83    on the other hand a direct integration of the malus correlation ( [ qmalus ] ) with the antiparallel distribution function given by eq .",
    "( [ lgh ] ) leads to : @xmath84 this result does not violate the bell inequality ( [ bell ] ) and is off from the quantum mechanical result ( [ qepr ] ) by a factor of @xmath85 .",
    "this can be simply fixed by a change of the @xmath86-prefactor in ( [ lgh ] ) into @xmath87 . but",
    "this change has tremendous consequences for the normalization of the distribution function ( [ lgh ] ) . in order to preserve the normalization we write : @xmath88 we check that indeed with this change : @xmath89 we calculate the marginals : @xmath90 clearly the function ( [ qlgf ] ) has the correct marginals ( [ marginals ] ) ,",
    "reproduces the right quantum mechanical prefactor and yet is not positive !",
    "the appearance of such a nonpositive probability distribution function ( called for this reason a quasi - distribution function ) is a typical quantum property , whenever a probabilistic phase - space is constructed for noncommuting quantum observables .",
    "the first nonpositive quasi - probability distribution was introduced into quantum mechanics by wigner in 1932 ( @xcite ) for the position and the momentum phase - space .",
    "the quasi - distribution function ( [ qlgf ] ) corresponds to a wigner - type distribution function for the spin-@xmath0 phase - space variables .",
    "in fact it is possible to study and derive rigorously @xcite all kinds of quantum mechanical spin-@xmath0 quasi - distribution functions with ( [ qlgf ] ) being just an example corresponding to the quantum ghost field of the epr singlet state ( [ singlet ] ) .    the quantum malus law ( [ qmalus ] ) , if applied to the joint correlations involving two stern - gerlach detectors , has the formal structure of a hidden variable theory , with the hidden parameters represented by `` hidden directions '' @xmath60 and @xmath91 .",
    "there the analogy ends because the quantum distribution corresponding to the local ghost field is a non - positive function that leads to the failure of the bell s inequalities for such a correlated state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . using the malus form of spin correlations we have :    @xmath92",
    "in this section we are going to show that epr correlations can be described by a quantum nonlocal ghost field similar to the one used in a hidden - variables theory .",
    "we can rewrite the spin correlation function ( [ qepr ] ) in terms of a ghost field if we use the following two integral identities for the pauli matrices matrices :    @xmath93    introducing these identities into ( [ qepr])we obtain :    @xmath94    where the distribution function is given by the following quantum mechanical average : @xmath95 with the help of this distribution function we have rewritten the quantum mechanical correlation function in a form which has remarkable similarities to the correlation function given by eq .",
    "( [ lhv ] ) .",
    "because the spin operators @xmath96 and @xmath97 have eigenvalues equal to @xmath15 or @xmath16 , i.e. , can represent only `` parallel '' ( `` p '' ) or `` antiparallel '' ( `` a '' ) outcomes , @xmath98 and @xmath99 can take only values equal to @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the bivalued distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ ccd ] ) is positive everywhere and normalized : @xmath100 this function depends on the polarization directions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the distribution function which depends on the orientation @xmath17 of the first stern - gerlach apparatus and on the orientation @xmath18 of the second ( possibly even remote ) stern - gerlach apparatus is nonlocal . because of this property",
    "we shall call an analyzer - dependent distribution function a nonlocal distribution function .",
    "the nonlocality of this distribution function makes the bell s inequality void , because in order to obtain this inequality the existence of a universal , local ( polarization independent ) distribution in the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( hidden parameters in this case ) like that appearing in ( [ lhv ] ) was essential @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics tells us that if we insist on a distribution of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ ccd ] ) , we can do it but only under the condition that the statistical distribution of the ghost field with the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 is nonlocal @xcite .    this joint distribution function ( [ ccd ] ) can be written in the following form ( bayes theorem ) :    @xmath101    where the distribution @xmath102 is the conditional of the event @xmath98 to occur under the condition that @xmath99 has occurred .",
    "the distribution @xmath103 is a one - fold marginal of ( [ ccd ] ) and is : @xmath104 this means the the one - fold marginal is local ( apparatus independent ) and that the outcomes are equally probable ie . ,",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "in order to elucidate the nonlocal distribution further we shall rewrite the nonlocal conditional distribution function in the following matrix form : @xmath107 from eq.([ccd ] ) and the form of the epr singlet state we obtain that the conditional probabilities for the particular transitions are @xmath108    this result shows that one can regard the epr correlations as just correlations of two sequences of random numbers jumping between values @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( `` p '' and `` a '' answers ) for polarization measurements performed with linear analyzers .",
    "the distribution @xmath109 is the conditional of the event @xmath34 ( `` p '' or `` a '' ) to occur under the condition that @xmath35 ( `` a '' or `` p '' ) has occurred .",
    "this positive and nonlocal distribution leads to a simple statistical interpretation of the spin transitions and of the violation of bell s inequality in terms of random numbers @xmath29 for the variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the quantum mechanical average in this case is represented by an ensemble average of two sequences of random numbers `` a '' and `` p '' . the random character of these variables can be applied to the description of the epr correlations measured by two polarizers . to each polarizer there corresponds a sequence of random variables denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these are the only possible outcome of the experiment . on each single polarizer",
    "the outcomes are completely random and the `` p '' and `` a '' answers occur with equal probability ( @xmath12 in this case ) .",
    "the nonlocality of the epr correlations shows up in the fact that these two perfectly random sequences ( on the first and the second analyzer ) are correlated and the correlations are given by eq .",
    "( [ qepr ] ) .",
    "these formulas predict that the epr wave function can be understood as a nonlocal correlation between two random sequences @xmath110 and @xmath111 . the nonlocality of these correlations follows from the fact that whenever @xmath112 or @xmath113 on the polarizer @xmath18 , we must have @xmath114 or @xmath115 on the analyzer @xmath17 with the probability @xmath116 , i.e. , the outcomes on @xmath17 ( possibly even a remote analyzer ) are determined by the outcomes on the analyzer @xmath117 .    for antiparallel correlations @xmath118 and the conditional matrix has the following form : @xmath119 this ghost field correspond to the following two outcomes at the stern - gerlach analyzers : @xmath120 we see that the outcomes correspond to two random sequences with perfect correlation corresponding to @xmath121 with conditional probability one and @xmath122 and @xmath123 with conditional probability zero .",
    "let us illustrate , using these random sequences , the violation of bell s inequality .",

    "this leads to the spin correlation : @xmath127 we already have shown ( [ violation ] ) that these correlation do violate the bell inequality ( [ bell ] ) .",
    "the nonlocal ghost field contradicts the idea of objective realities because the probability of reproducing a sequence on the polarizer @xmath17 if the sequence on the polarizer @xmath18 is known is nonlocal if the ghost field distribution depends on the relative orientation @xmath55 of the polarizers . this is how the epr quantum nonlocal probabilities violate local realism ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) : @xmath128    in fact it is easy to give an example of a ghost field that will not violate the bell inequality in this case . if we select :    @xmath129    we obtain that : @xmath130 which does not violate the bell inequality .",
    "the quantum nonlocal ghost field predicts in this case that the outcomes on the two stern - gerlach detectors is the same with a 75% confidence while hidden variables will lead to @xmath131 confidence .",
    "the quantum correlations induced by the nonlocal quantum ghost ( [ qnlgf ] ) are `` stronger '' compared to the one obtained in the frame work of local objective realities ( [ lhv ] ) .",
    "the two different representations of quantum mechanics given by a local and nonpositive ghost field and by a nonlocal and positive ghost field are equivalent descriptions of spin-@xmath12 correlations and both have a hidden - variable look - a - like form .",
    "these descriptions are different in form , but are really equivalent to the standard formulation of quantum mechanics . instead of spin observables , projection operators and quantum states ,",

    "the relations ( [ qlgf ] ) and ( [ qnlgf ] ) show that the violation of bell s inequality can be due either to a nonpositive and local or to a positive and nonlocal distribution function .",
