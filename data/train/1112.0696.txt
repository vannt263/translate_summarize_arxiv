    "<S> the following three classes of singularities are expected : @xmath31 simple ultraviolet poles which must be removed by the standard renormalization procedure ; @xmath32 pure rapidity divergences , which depend on an additional rapidity parameter , but do not jeopardize the renormalizability of the tmds , and can be safely resumed by means of the collins - soper equation ; @xmath33 highly undesirable overlapping divergences : they contain the uv and rapidity poles simultaneously and thus break down the standard renormalizability of tmds , calling for a generalized renormalization procedure in order to enable the construction of a consistent operator definition of the tmds . </S>",

    "<S> let me suggest the following _ conjecture _ concerning the generic structure of divergences in ( any reasonable ) operator definition of the tmd beyond the tree - approximation :    the contribution of the overlapping @xmath56 singularities to the renormalized tmd can be expressed either in terms of a finite number of the cusp anomalous dimensions which are known in the theory of wilson lines / loops up to the @xmath22-order  in this case , their treatment consists of the subtraction of ( a finite number of ) corresponding _ cusped soft factors _ ; or those singularities depend on the _ degenerate rapidities _ @xmath57in that case , one has to subtract the self - energy soft factors which consist , in contrast , of the `` smooth '' infinite gauge links without any obstructions ( cusp or intersections ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conjecture is , therefore , that _ there is no other sort of unphysical singularities in the loop corrections to the tmds in any order of @xmath58_.    in the leading order , we demonstrated the validity of the above statement in our works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , some interesting aspects of the tmd factorization , light - like wilson lines and renormalization properties of the pdfs have been studied adopting the methodology of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . an important question remains , however , how our tmd can be built into an appropriate factorization formula for semi - inclusive hadronic tensor . in our approach , </S>",

    "<S> the explicit proof of the conjectured factorization and of absence of double - counting is in progress .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , collins proposed a new definition of the ( quark ) tmd @xcite which is built into the factorization formula for the semi - inclusive hadronic tensor ( up to power corrections ) @xmath60 } ( x , \\bm k_\\perp ; \\mu , \\zeta_f)\\otimes { \\cal d}^{\\rm [ col . ] } ( z , z \\bm k'_\\perp ; \\mu , \\zeta_d ) + ... \\ ,   \\label{eq : col_factor}\\ ] ] where all soft factors are absorbed into the tmd distribution @xmath61 and the fragmentation @xmath62 functions , so that there are no separate soft factors in factorized structure functions , e.g. , @xmath63 } ( x , \\bm b_\\perp ; \\mu , \\zeta_f )    =    { \\cal f}_{\\rm unsub.}^{[{\\rm a}_{\\rm </S>",

    "<S> \\label{eq : tmd_col}\\ ] ] here the soft factors depend on the light - like @xmath25 or the tilted @xmath64 vectors ( for details , see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the tmd ( [ eq : tmd_col ] ) is defined in the impact parameter space @xmath65 , so that it is , in fact , a `` semi - integrated pdf '' and the reduction to the collinear case corresponds to the limit @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> some phenomenological and lattice applications of this approach have already been discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the gauge links in the soft factors is presented and explained in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    several open questions are still to be answered : @xmath31 how should one prove the complete gauge invariance of the tmd ( [ eq : tmd_col ] ) ? </S>",
    "<S> it is formulated in the covariant feynman gauge where the transverse gauge links at light - cone infinity vanish . </S>",
    "<S> what will change , if we adopt some physical ( axial ) gauge ? </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 in particular , how one should treat the @xmath66odd effects in the axial gauges given that the structure of the transverse gauge links at light - cone infinity is not yet clarified in the tmd ( [ eq : tmd_col ] ) ? </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 after reduction to the collinear pdf ( in the case of tmd ( [ eq : tmd_col ] ) , this corresponds to the limit @xmath45 ) , there is neither a mutual compensation of the longitudinal , nor that of the transverse gauge links ( if introduced in the usual manner ) , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . hence , the geometrical structure of the gauge links in the collinear pdf obtained from the tmd ( [ eq : tmd_col ] ) seems too cumbersome to be simply included in the standard dis factorization scheme ( see , e.g. , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    to conclude , several approaches to the problem of the factorization of semi - inclusive processes which make use of the unintegrated tmd parton distribution functions have been proposed and developed so far . </S>",
    "<S> there is no _ a priori _ clear relationship between these frameworks : e.g. , corresponding operator definitions of the tmds may , in principle , describe different objects with different ( renormalization - group , gauge invariance , evolution ) properties . </S>",
