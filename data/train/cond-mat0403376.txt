    "one of the greatest impacts from the discovery of high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors is renewed interest in the exotic mechanisms of superconductivity , and a boosted search for their model systems , which has led to a soaring number of novel materials identified as superconductors@xcite .",
    "they include varieties of transition - metal oxides , borides , borocarbides , and other intermetallic compounds with rare - earth elements .",
    "the list can be readily extended by including those based on organic materials , and is still growing in length .",
    "compared with classical simple metals or binary compound superconductors , they have a common distinctive feature that the pairing correlation is potentially highly anisotropic due to a strong electronic correlation ( coulomb repulsion ) and/or a considerably two - dimensional nature of the fermi surface , which is also shared by cuprate superconductors .",
    "it is well established that any metallic system can fall into a superconducting state when there is an effective interaction that is attractive between the conduction electrons ( pair correlation ) . in this situation ,",
    "electrons tend to form a bound ( pairing ) state between those with opposite momenta ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , so that the phase of the pairing wave - function may become absolute zero@xcite .",
    "this instability towards the formation of electronic bound states without a barrier is an intrinsic character of the fermi surface , irrespective of the microscopic mechanism of the attractive interaction .",
    "when the pair correlation is mediated by the electron - phonon interaction , as in ordinary cubic metals , the pair correlation has the least dependence on @xmath3 ( relative orbital angular momentum @xmath5 ) , and thereby the structure of the superconducting order parameter @xmath6 is isotropic over the entire fermi surface . because of the mandatory requirement of fermi statistics that the electronic wave - function must be anti - symmetric , the remaining freedom of the spin state in the paring function is set to be a singlet ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this pair correlation , having @xmath8-wave and spin singlet symmetry , is conventionally called the  bcs mechanism \" ; in its narrower sense , the electron - phonon interaction is presumed to be the primary origin of the attractive interaction@xcite .    historically , the first sign of non - bcs type pairing was found in the superfluidity of liquid @xmath9he@xcite , where the neutral @xmath9he atoms ( which have a nuclear spin of 1/2 and thereby obey fermi statistics ) play the role of electrons in superconductivity .",
    "it is known that liquid @xmath9he can be regarded as being a fermi liquid ( i.e. , having a well - defined fermi surface ) below @xmath10 mk , and that it becomes a superfluid below a few mk , where it can flow narrow channels without friction ( superfluidity ) .",
    "however , there is a major difference between the nature of pairing between @xmath9he atoms and that of the bcs type .",
    "the @xmath9he atoms have a hard core of a repulsive interaction with a relatively large radius , which makes it difficult to pair in a state with zero angular momentum .",
    "thus , many theories have predicted that @xmath9he atoms may pair in a @xmath11-wave ( @xmath12 ) or @xmath13-wave ( @xmath14 ) state , where they can keep themselves apart while the pairing interaction is at work@xcite .",
    "later , experiments confirmed that they were indeed in a @xmath11-wave state .",
    "this also meant that the spin part of the pairing wave - function ( order parameter ) must be in a triplet state ( @xmath15 ) , leading to a variety of possibilities for the total state of the pairing wave - function ( @xmath16 ) to break symmetry .",
    "it is now established that there are at least three different phases in the superfluidity of liquid @xmath9he that all have different order parameters .",
    "it is readily predicted that the situation similar to that in liquid @xmath9he can be realized when a short - range repulsive electronic correlation is not negligible in metallic superconductivity . as has been established during the past decade ,",
    "high-@xmath2 cuprates are among the first such examples in which electrons pair in a state other than an @xmath8-wave due to a strong on - site repulsive correlation .",
    "the cooper pairs in cuprates prefer a @xmath13-wave because of the tetragonal structure of the two - dimensional cuo@xmath17 lattice and the associated symmetry of the fermi surface .",
    "more specifically , the pairing is a @xmath18-wave and the order parameter is described by a gap function , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the maximum value of the anisotropic gap ; the energy gap vanishes along the lines @xmath21 , which are called _",
    "line nodes_. it also happens that the electronic correlation in cuprates is antiferromagnetic , as is naturally expected for doped mott insulators , which makes it favorable to form spin singlet pairs .",
    "the latter points to a magnetic origin as a pairing mechanism , irrespective of the true nature of the ground state which is still under debate .",
    "thus , the structure of the superconducting order parameter reflects important characteristics of the electronic correlation .    in this paper , we review our recent studies on the structure of the superconducting order parameter in novel type ii superconductors by muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath1sr ) .",
    "it is well known that a magnetic field can penetrate type ii superconductors as a bundle of quantum flux lines ( magnetic vortices)@xcite , where the spatial field distribution , @xmath22 , becomes inhomogeneous due to gradual change in the supercurrent flow around the vortices .",
    "the degree of inhomogeneity , which is primarily determined by the magnetic penetration depth ( @xmath0 ) , a magnetic cutoff parameter ( @xmath23 , which is proportional to the ginsburg - landau ( gl ) coherence length @xmath24 ) and the spacing of vortices ( @xmath25 ) can be measured directly by @xmath1sr as a spin - spin relaxation ( @xmath26 ) . by applying a refined analysis technique , one can reconstruct @xmath22 more accurately so that both @xmath0 and @xmath23 may be deduced separately@xcite . among various experimental techniques applied to a similar end ,",
    "@xmath1sr technique is unique in many respects .",
    "namely , it is a microscopic technique that can be applied to virtually any superconductors having a reasonable magnetic penetration depth ( @xmath27  ) . because of the purely magnetic nature of a spin 1/2 probe , the interpretation of the @xmath1sr spectra is free from any complication due to additional interactions from higher multipoles often found in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "the @xmath1sr technique is sensitive to the bulk property , and is thus free from effects specific to the surface , while they are often problems for scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) or angular - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .    in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate that the temperature / field dependence of @xmath0 is strongly affected by the anisotropy of the order parameter .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 is enhanced by an external field due to the doppler shift of quasiparticles in the gap nodes@xcite , which leads to almost a linear increase of @xmath0 with increasing field .",
    "this feature is regarded as an unambiguous sign of the presence of nodes in the energy gap .",
    "we show several examples of field - dependent @xmath0 , some of which are indeed identified to have anisotropic order parameter by other experimental techniques",
    ". a more comprehensive review of a similar study can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "in penetration - depth measurements , it is common to assume a geometrical condition that muons are implanted into a specimen with the initial spin polarization perpendicular to the external field , @xmath28 .",
    "then , since muons stop randomly along the length scale of the flux line lattice ( fll ) , the time evolution of complex muon polarization , @xmath29 , provides a random sampling of the internal field distribution , @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is proportional to the time - dependent @xmath33-@xmath34 decay asymmetry , @xmath35 , deduced from a corresponding sets of positron counters , @xmath36 is the spectral density for the internal field defined as a spatial average ( @xmath37 ) of the delta function , @xmath38 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio ( = @xmath39135.53 mhz / t ) , and @xmath40 is the initial phase of muon precession@xcite . the additional relaxation ( @xmath41 )",
    "is mainly due to random local fields from nuclear magnetic moments ( @xmath420.1 @xmath1s@xmath43 ) and the distortion of flux line lattice due to a random pinning of vortices ( @xmath44 ) , which can be approximated by a gaussian relaxation@xcite .",
    "these equations indicate that the real amplitude of the fourier - transformed muon precession signal corresponds to @xmath36 with an appropriate correction of @xmath41 .",
    "while @xmath45 can be estimated from the spectrum in the normal state , @xmath44 often needs to be considered as a variable parameter , depending on the temperature and/or external magnetic field .    in modeling the internal field distribution of vortex state ,",
    "the simplest approach is to assume that the field distribution is a linear superposition of that for an isolated vortex , as presumed in the london theory@xcite .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption as long as the inter - vortex distance is much longer than the gl coherence length ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "then , what we need is to know the field distribution around a single vortex and the structure of the vortex lattice .",
    "the latter must be given from other sources of information , such as small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) or scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) .",
    "in the london model , @xmath22 is approximated as the sum of the magnetic induction from isolated vortices , to yield @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the vortex reciprocal lattice vectors , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the average internal field , @xmath0 is the london penetration depth , and @xmath51 is a nonlocal correction term with @xmath23  being the cutoff parameter for the _ magnetic _ field distribution ; care must be taken not to interpret @xmath23  naively as @xmath24 which is for the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter . while the lorentzian cutoff , @xmath52 , is predicted to be a better approximation for the gl theory at lower fields@xcite , the gaussian cutoff , @xmath53 , generally provides satisfactory agreement with the data@xcite .",
    "note , however , that the gaussian cutoff is derived from the gl equations near @xmath54 , and thus would not be appropriate at lower fields .",
    "a comparison of the analysis on identical data indicates that a gaussian cutoff yields a signficantly larger value for @xmath0  and a stronger field dependence ( about a factor 2 ) than those obtained by a lorentzian cutoff@xcite .    besides the london model",
    ", there are a couple of models for @xmath22 based on the ginsburg - landau theory .",
    "although the gl equations can be solved to yield an approximate analytical solution for the mixed state near @xmath55 or @xmath54 , it must be solved numerically for intermediate fields .",
    "fortunately , it is known that the field distribution obtained from exact numerical solutions of the gl equations is in excellent agreement with that from the modified london model at low fields and arbitrary @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , the gl parameter)@xcite .     a magnetic field distribution @xmath36 calculated by the modified london model with a triangular flux line lattice . ( the lorentzian cutoff was assumed . )",
    "the marking ` c ' refers to the contribution from vortex cores , ` s ' to saddles , and ` v ' to valleys , respectively .",
    "the gaussian distribution is only meant for a guide to eye . ]",
    "one of the most important characteristics of @xmath36 obtained from these models is the site - selective feature of the line shape . as shown in fig .",
    "[ bdis ] , the sharp peak due to the van hove singularity found in the lower field mainly represents the contribution from the saddle points of @xmath22 , the lower field end from the central valleys among vortices , and the high field end from the region near the vortex cores .",
    "this quite asymmetric field profile with such a geometrical correspondence allows us to determine @xmath0 and @xmath23 reliably by comparing the time evolution of the muon spin polarization with that calculated by @xmath36 .",
    "it is often the case that the superconducting properties in non - cubic compounds are strongly anisotropic , leading to a large difference between the magnetic penetration depths for in - plane and perpendicular directions .",
    "more specifically , in uniaxial superconductors with @xmath58 and @xmath59 being the carrier mass for in - plane and perpendicular directions , we have @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the polar angle of the @xmath63-axis , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( with @xmath66 ) , and @xmath67 thus , the line shape depends on @xmath68 and @xmath69 in a complex manner@xcite .      when the quality of @xmath1sr  data is good enough to be analyzed by the above model , we can obtain @xmath0 and @xmath23 simultaneously by directly comparing the @xmath1sr  time spectrum with that calculated from @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , our experience shows that this is not always the case when the sample is not a single crystal , or @xmath0 happens to be very large , etc . so that the characteristic features of @xmath36 and the associated time spectra important for such analysis are smeared out .",
    "in such a situation , the gaussian field distribution has been used as a convenient analytical model , where the depolarization rate is presumed to be given by the second moment of the field distribution ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 which is reflected as @xmath72 relaxation in the @xmath1sr  line shape .",
    "the gaussian distribution of local fields naturally leads to a gaussian depolarization function , @xmath73 for the ideal case of a triangular fll with an isotropic effective carrier mass and a cutoff @xmath74 provided by the numerical solution of the gl theory , @xmath0 can be deduced from @xmath75 using the following relation@xcite : @xmath76 = 4.83\\times 10 ^ 4(1-h ) \\lambda^{-2}\\ [ { \\rm nm } ] , \\label{sgmhl}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 .",
    "while the above form is valid for @xmath78 or @xmath79 , a more useful approximation valid for an arbitrary field is @xcite @xmath76 = 4.83\\times 10 ^ 4 ( 1-h)[1 + 3.9(1-h)^2]^{1/2 } \\lambda^{-2}\\ [ { \\rm nm } ] .",
    "\\label{sgmh}\\ ] ] the field dependence of those equations represent a reduction of the gaussian width due to a stronger overlap of vortices at higher fields , while @xmath0 is a constant ; therefore , the deviation of @xmath80 from those equations can be attributed to the change of @xmath0 with the field .    however , the microscopic situation of the fll state is considerably different from the above  ideal \" one in practical cases where gaussian damping is actually observed , because there must be an additional effect of randomness to round up the sharp feature of @xmath36 .",
    "this also makes it difficult to distinguish @xmath41 from @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) , giving rise to a problem in comparing the values of @xmath0 , for example , between those from an analysis using the modified london model and those obtained from the gaussian approximation ( where the influence of @xmath41 is indistinguishable ) .",

    "a linear fit yields @xmath85 and 1.53 , respectively .",

    "according to our result , the gaussian distribution originates from the distribution of @xmath0 ( which may vary at different sample domains ) , which must be present in the polycrystalline powder specimen of anisotropic superconductors ( e.g. , @xmath90 ) .",
    "as is also clear in the field profile shown in fig .",

    "( [ gauss ] ) due to the strongly exponential - like damping ; this is obviously due to the contribution of high - frequency tails in the spectral density , @xmath36 .",
    "( thus , the use of the second moment as an approximation in the ideal situation would be valid only when the relaxation rate is small enough to eliminate the asymmetric feature of @xmath36 . )",

    "is seen , except for the case when @xmath100  , where @xmath81 takes systematically lower values at all fields .",
    "this can be readily understood by considering the fact that @xmath75 is enhanced by an amount @xmath101 as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ sgmlmd ] ) .",
    "we also examined the field dependence of @xmath0 , which would be most crucial in the following arguments , @xmath102,\\label{lmdeh}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is a dimensionless parameter used to express the magnitude of the field dependence . as is evident in fig .",
    "[ simu ] , the slope @xmath104 is slightly weaker than the original assumption ; when we take @xmath84 for the simulation , we obtain @xmath105 as the corresponding slope for @xmath81 . however , when there is no field dependence of @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) , @xmath81 exhibits the least dependence on the field ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the field dependence of the penetration depth ( as a mean value ) obtained from the gaussian field approximation provides a sound basis for the characterization of superconductors .",
    "in the fll state , the quasiparticle momentum @xmath106 is shifted by the flow of supercurrent @xmath107 around the vortices due to a semi - classical doppler shift , leading to a shift of the quasiparticle energy spectrum to an amount @xmath108 . since the density of state ( dos ) , @xmath109 ,",
    "is non - zero , except at the fermi level ( @xmath110 ) and is higher at larger energy ( @xmath111 ) for the anisotropic order parameter , quasiparticles can be excited by the doppler shift outside of the vortex cores with a population proportional to @xmath112 , leading to an enhancement of @xmath0 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the cooper pairs with a gap energy of less than @xmath113 can be broken by the doppler shift ( see fig .  [ doppler ] ) .",
    "historically , a similar effect was considered first for type i superconductors , where the non - linear response of the shielding current in the meissner effect due to the  backflow \" of quasiparticles was discussed@xcite .",
    "fermi surface shifted by the quasiclassical doppler effect due to the supercurrent @xmath114 around vortices .",
    "while such a shift has no effect on the quasiparticle excitation for the isotropic gap ( @xmath115 ) , it induces additional excitation by breaking pairs near to the nodal region ( pointed by arrows ) . ]",
    "the magnitude of @xmath103 represents the degree for the increase of dos for quasiparticles , which must be roughly proportional to the phase volume of the fermi surface where the doppler shift exceeds the gap energy ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "it also follows that the effect depends on the direction of @xmath107 ( and hence that of the external field @xmath117 relative to the order parameter ) in a sigle crystalline specimen . according to volovik ,",
    "the quasiparticle density of state for the anisotropic order parameter is @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the dos for the normal state and @xmath121 is a constant on the order of unity@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath121 is proportional to the phase volume of the low excitation energy in @xmath6 , thereby carrying information on the degree of anisotropy for @xmath6 ; the factor @xmath122 comes from the inter - vortex distance ( @xmath123 ) multiplied by the number of vortices ( @xmath124 ) .",

    "[ lmdnrm ] .",
    "thus , the comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ lmdeh ] ) and ( [ lmdh ] ) yields @xmath130 indicating that the slope @xmath103 reflects the phase volume of the fermi surface where @xmath131 .     field dependence of @xmath0 normalized by the value at @xmath132 for the case @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "it is well represented by a linear dependence , as in eq .",
    "( [ lmdh ] ) with @xmath135 . ]",
    "since the doppler shift is far smaller than the gap energy in the usual situation for the isotropic gap , no such enhancement is expected for the conventional @xmath8-wave pairing ( @xmath1361 ) . a recent theoretical calculation based on the bogoliubov - de - gennes ( bdg ) equations indicates , however , @xmath103 is not exactly zero for @xmath8-wave pairing , although it is much smaller than that for @xmath18-pairing@xcite .",
    "it must also be noted that the effect of temperature must be considered to evaluate the degree of anisotropy from the measurement of @xmath103 . in general , the phase volume of the fermi surface where @xmath137 also contributes to quasiparticle excitation .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the observation of a finite @xmath103 means the presence of a small gap region with an upper bound of @xmath138 ( see below , the case of mgb@xmath17 for example ) .",
    "because a superconducting pair correlation occurs over a finite length scale , @xmath139 ( i.e , the bcs coherence length ) , the electromagnetic response of superconductors is subject to various non - local effects .",
    "the primary example is the cutoff term , @xmath51 , incorporated in the modified london model ( eq .  ( [ br ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , there are a couple of other corrections that must be considered for anisotropic superconductors .    in the superconducting state with gap nodes in the order parameter",
    ", the quasiparticles are mostly confined to the vicinity of the nodes at low temperatures .",
    "this generally leads to the suppression of quasiparticle excitation due to the non - local electrodynamics caused by the divergent coherence length , @xmath140 , yielding a weaker temperature / field dependence of @xmath0 at higher fields@xcite .",
    "such an effect has been studied experimentally in detail for the case of yba@xmath17cu@xmath141o@xmath142@xcite .",
    "another important correction comes from the anisotropy of the fermi surface .",
    "novel superconductors including cuprates have a common feature that the fermi surface tends to exhibit a strong anisotropy due to , e.g. , a two - dimensional and/or multi - band character , which influences the flow of supercurrent over a length scale , @xmath143@xcite .",
    "more specifically , the length scale is also controlled by the mean - free path ( @xmath144 ) for electrons .",
    "it turns out that this non - local correction partially accounts for the change in the vortex lattice structure from triangular to squared lattice in various systems , including @xmath145ni@xmath17b@xmath17c ( @xmath145=y , lu)@xcite , v@xmath141si@xcite , and la@xmath146sr@xmath147cuo@xmath148 ( @xmath149)@xcite . this also leads to a change in @xmath22 due to the modified flow of supercurrent from circular to squared shape ( see below , e.g. yni@xmath17b@xmath17c ) .",
    "note , however , that the difference in the free energy between a triangular and a square vortex lattice is fairly small , making the lowest - energy configuration strongly dependent on other physical quantities , such as the temperature , magnetic field , and crystal orientation , which is also in a strong correlation with the superconducting order parameter .",
    "in this section , we try to establish the correspondence between the presence of the anisotropic order parameter and a non - zero slope ( @xmath103 ) in the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath150 .",
    "as shown below , @xmath103 provides a good measure for the degree of anisotropy in the superconducting order parameter .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that additional information is generally needed to resolve the precise symmetry of the pairing ; one would be easily led to a false conclusion in choosing , e.g. , between @xmath13- and @xmath151-wave pairing based solely upon the @xmath1sr result .",
    "another origin of apparent anisotropy would be multi - gap order parameters with one of those having a small gap ( @xmath152 ) , as suggested in the case of mgb@xmath17 ( see below ) .",
    "while a vast body of superconductors have been investigated by @xmath1sr , there are not many of them in which the field dependence of @xmath150 has been measured in detail .",
    "this is partly due to the historical reason that the @xmath1sr apparatus with a high magnetic field has become available for routine service only since the late 90s . here , we summarize our recent work on ceru@xmath17 , y(pt , ni)@xmath17b@xmath17c , cd@xmath17re@xmath17o@xmath153 , and mgb@xmath17 , in which detailed @xmath1sr measurements have been performed .",

    "one of the current issues is its magnetic response at higher fields ( @xmath156 ) , where an anomalous enhancement of quasiparticle excitation has been reported .",
    "this is suggested by the observation of de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) oscillation over a field region where the cyclotron radius is much larger than the inter - vortex distance@xcite .",
    "the presence of excess quasipaticles has been further confirmed by a strong enhancement of @xmath0  measuremed by @xmath1sr  at higher fields@xcite .",
    "moreover , while most of experimental studies concluded that the pairing symmetry is a spin - singlet @xmath8-wave , detailed studies on the spin - lattice relaxation in nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) suggested the presence of anisotropy in the order parameter@xcite .",
    "this was apparently in line with the observed non - linear field dependence ( @xmath157 ) of the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath158@xcite ; as indicated in eq .",

    "the key to understand the varying results in borocarbides is that the anisotropy of the order parameter is indeed sensitive to impurities , which is in good contrast to the robustness of superconductivity , itself ; @xmath151-pairing , for example , changes into an effectively isotropic @xmath8-wave pairing , where the anisotropic part ( associated with @xmath174-component ) is washed out by impurity scattering .",
