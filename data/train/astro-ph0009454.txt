    "starburst galaxies ( sbgs ) are selected usually by optical emission lines .",
    "they originate in ionized gas around o stars .",
    "the classical examples are the markarian sbgs , which account for 3% of the field galaxies ( balzano 1983 ) . however , the above selection is biased toward young sbgs .",
    "the markarian sbgs are actually at starburst ages of @xmath0 20 myr ( calzetti 1997 ) .",
    "a starburst event generates many b stars , which live longer than o stars . with increasing the starburst age and decreasing the star formation rate , o",
    "stars become few but b stars remain numerous . such old sbgs",
    "have not been explored , except for some case studies ( rieke , lebofsky , & walker 1988 ; koornneef 1993 ) . in particular",
    ", their space density is unknown .",
    "the present knowledge of sbgs is thus incomplete .    by comparing the markarian objects with sbgs in the palomar survey ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997a , b , c ) , we propose that old sbgs outnumber classical sbgs by a factor of @xmath110 and make up major constituents of the nearby galaxies .",
    "the palomar survey is an optical spectroscopic survey for nuclear regions on a magnitude - limited sample of 486 galaxies ( @xmath2 @xmath0 12.5 mag ) , is more sensitive to faint line emission than previous surveys , and thus provides a fair representation of the local galaxy population .",
    "roughly 40% of the palomar galaxies exhibit line emission , albeit weak , resembling those of regions .",
    "we find that many of these palomar sbgs are as luminous as the markarian sbgs in the far - infrared ( fir ) .",
    "however , the palomar sbgs are not so luminous in the mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "since the fir and mir continua arise from dust grains heated by b and o stars , respectively ( mouri & taniguchi 1992 ) , it is concluded that the palomar sbgs are dominated by old objects where o stars are few .",
    "we confirm this conclusion with a model for infrared spectra of sbgs , and discuss some of its implications .    throughout this letter ,",
    "the term sbg is used to represent a galaxy harboring a starburst region .",
    "most of the palomar and markarian sbgs are galaxies with nuclear starbursts .",
    "this is because ho et al .",
    "( 1997a , b , c ) and balzano ( 1983 ) surveyed galaxy nuclei .",
    "we focus on sbgs dominated by starbursts , and study their total fir and mir emissions .",
    "the present work is based on the fir continuum fluxes at 60 and 100 @xmath3 m as well as the mir continuum flux at 25 @xmath3 m , measured by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) . for the palomar sbgs",
    ", we use the data compiled by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) . for the markarian sbgs ,",
    "the data are from soifer et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and moshir et al .",
    "these _ iras _ fluxes represent emissions from the whole galaxy .",
    "the _ iras _ apertures are large enough to encompass most of the galaxies . spatially integrated fluxes are used for extended sources .",
    "the statistical properties are summarized in figure 1 , where filled areas denote the palomar sbgs and open areas denote the markarian sbgs .",
    "only a few objects are common to the two samples .",
    "the object numbers and median values are given in the figure caption .",
    "figure 1@xmath4 shows the distribution of the fir luminosity @xmath5 . the fir flux between 40 and 120 @xmath3 m is defined as @xmath6 w m@xmath7 ( fullmer & lonsdale 1989 ) .",
    "here @xmath8 is the flux density at @xmath9 @xmath3 m in janskys .",
    "the galaxy distances are taken from ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , or calculated from the redshifts in the cosmic - microwave - background frame with @xmath10 = 75 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the fir luminosity exceeds 10@xmath12 @xmath13 in 30% of the palomar sbgs and 50% of the markarian sbgs .",
    "hereafter we focus on these sbgs .",
    "their fir emission is dominated by starbursts .",
    "the archetypical sbgs such as m82 and ngc 253 actually exhibit @xmath5 @xmath14 a few @xmath15 10@xmath12 @xmath13 . for most of the palomar and",
    "markarian sbgs with @xmath5 @xmath16 10@xmath12 @xmath13 , we find @xmath5 @xmath16 @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the total @xmath18-band luminosity , and @xmath5 @xmath16 @xmath17 is expected for a strong starburst ( moorwood 1996 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "figures 1@xmath19 and 1@xmath20 show , respectively , the distributions of the spectral indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "they are defined as @xmath23 = @xmath24 .",
    "the palomar sbgs prefer low values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while the markarian sbgs prefer high values .",
    "the probabilities that the two samples represent different distributions are @xmath25 99.99% , if we apply the generalized wilcoxon tests for data with upper limits ( feigelson & nelson 1985 ) or the usual kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "when we plot @xmath21 or @xmath22 against @xmath5 , the palomar and markarian sbgs are separated at each of the values of @xmath5 .",
    "the palomar sbgs with the lowest values of @xmath21 tend to exhibit the lowest values of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , although many of the palomar sbgs have fir luminosities being comparable to those of the markarian sbgs , their _ iras _ colors are systematically different .",
    "the difference in @xmath21 between the palomar and markarian sbgs is due to a difference in the starburst age . to demonstrate this , we reproduce the @xmath21 value with an empirical model ( mouri & taniguchi 1992 ) , where two emission components with fixed colors are related to the ionizing - photon flux @xmath26 and the bolometric luminosity @xmath27 .",
    "they are in turn calculated with evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "our approach is supported by an anti - correlation between the spectral index @xmath21 and the flux ratio [ ] 6300 / h@xmath28 among sbgs ( mouri & taniguchi 1992 ; larkin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath28 ratio is a measure of the number ratio of supernovae to o stars . a variation in the @xmath21 value reflects a variation in the stellar population rather than color variations in the individual emission components .",
    "the color variations , together with a variation in the excitation efficiency of the [ ] emission , are merely responsible for scatter around the anti - correlation .",
    "there are two types of dust grains .",
    "large grains are in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field , while small grains are heated transiently to high temperatures by single photons . since small grains are destroyed in the vicinity of o stars , the infrared continuum is a mixture of i ) mir emission from hot large grains within ionized gas , ii ) fir emission from warm large grains outside ionized gas , and iii ) mir emission from small grains outside ionized gas ( see fig . 1 of mouri , kawara , & taniguchi 1997 m should be read as 076 @xmath15 46 .",
    "the second equation of the footnote 1 should be read as @xmath29 = @xmath30^{-1}$ ] hz@xmath11 . ] ) . to indicate that a quantity is relevant to hot large , warm large , large , or small grains , we hereafter use the suffix hlg , wlg , lg , or sg .",
    "we assume that grains absorb all the stellar photons , except for those used in ionizing the gas .",
    "since some of nonionizing photons actually escape from a starburst region , our model overestimates the importance of those photons . nevertheless , this effect is not serious .",
    "starburst regions are quite dusty . for example , the amount of extinction derived from the br@xmath28/br@xmath31 ratio is much greater than that derived from the h@xmath28/h@xmath32 ratio ( kawara , nishida , & phillips 1989 ) .",
    "hot large grains are heated by ly@xmath28 and ionizing photons .",
    "their luminosity is given by @xmath33 = @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the fraction of ionizing photons absorbed by the grains , @xmath36 is the energy of a ly@xmath28 photon , and @xmath37 @xmath14 @xmath38 is the mean energy of ionizing photons .",
    "large grains radiate as a greybody with an emissivity being proportional to @xmath39 : @xmath40 here the wavelength @xmath9 is in microns and the grain temperature @xmath41 is in kelvins .",
    "mouri et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimated as @xmath41 = @xmath42 @xmath14 140 k , from a comparison of the _ iras _ fluxes with the br@xmath31 flux on a sample of sbgs .",
    "mouri et al . also found a relation @xmath43 = @xmath44 , which yields @xmath35 @xmath14 0.5 if the case b recombination ( osterbrock 1989 ) is assumed for the br@xmath31 emission .",
    "these values are used in our calculation .",
    "baldwin et al .",
    "( 1991 ) studied the orion region and obtained similar results for @xmath42 and @xmath35 .",
    "the _ infrared space observatory _ detected mir emission from hot large grains in galaxies ( vigroux et al .",
    "1996 ; dale et al . 2000",
    "; see also dultzin - hacyan , masegosa , & moles 1990 ) .",
    "warm large grains and small grains are heated by nonionizing photons .",
    "their luminosities are given by @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 = @xmath48 .",
    "we use the model of boulanger et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , which is based on the _ iras _ observation of the california nebula .",
    "small grains absorb 45% of the nonionizing photons .",
    "the emergent spectrum is @xmath49 = @xmath50 with @xmath51 = @xmath52 hz@xmath11 . although small grains emitting at 12 @xmath3 m could be destroyed even outside ionized gas , this effect is negligible at @xmath25 25 @xmath3 m ( boulanger et al . 1988 ; mouri et al .",
    "warm large grains absorb the rest of the nonionizing photons and reradiate as the greybody ( [ a ] ) . since the median values of @xmath22 in the palomar and markarian sbgs correspond to @xmath41 = @xmath53 @xmath14 3040 k , we adopt @xmath53 = 35 k. the change of @xmath53 between 30 and 40 k is unimportant to the value of @xmath21 , as shown below in figure 2@xmath20 .",
    "the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 are obtained as a function of the starburst age @xmath54 from solar - metallicity synthesis models of leitherer et al .",
    "they adopted a salpeter initial mass function with the lower and upper cutoffs of 1 and 100 @xmath55 .",
    "we convolve their instantaneous burst models to obtain the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 for star formation rates decaying exponentially as @xmath56 . the starburst duration @xmath57 is set to be 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , or 50 myr .",
    "we also use their constant star formation models ( @xmath57 = @xmath58 ) .",
    "the results are summarized in figure 2 : ( @xmath4 ) @xmath26 , ( @xmath19 ) @xmath5 , and ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 . the ionizing - photon flux @xmath26 and the fir luminosity @xmath5 are normalized by their maximum values .",
    "when the starburst is young , ionizing photons are abundant . since the mir emission from hot large grains is strong , the spectral index @xmath21 is flat and close to the values observed in the markarian sbgs . with increasing the starburst age ,",
    "o stars begin to disappear .",
    "the ionizing - photon flux @xmath26 decreases , but the number of b stars and hence the fir luminosity @xmath5 still increase .",
    "since hot large grains are progressively unimportant , the spectral index @xmath21 becomes steep and approaches to the values observed in the palomar sbgs .",
    "while the markarian sbgs are dominated by young objects ( @xmath54 @xmath14 10 myr ) , we argue that the palomar sbgs with @xmath5 @xmath16 10@xmath12 @xmath13 are dominated by old objects ( @xmath54 @xmath14 10100 myr ) .",
    "the unbiased palomar survey provides a fair representation of the local galaxy population , where old sbgs are major constituents ( 3040% in number ) .",
    "the spectral index @xmath21 lies between @xmath59 and @xmath60 in 90% of the palomar sbgs ( fig .",
    "1@xmath19 ) .",
    "this percentage agrees with our model . the starburst age and duration in classical sbgs",
    "are estimated as @xmath54 @xmath14 @xmath57 @xmath14 1020 myr ( calzetti 1997 ; leitherer 1998 ) .",
    "for @xmath57 = 20 myr , the values @xmath21",
    "= @xmath59 and @xmath60 are reproduced , respectively , at @xmath54 @xmath14 10 myr and 100 myr ( fig .",
    "2@xmath20 ) .",
    "the markarian sbgs actually have the median value of @xmath21 = @xmath61 .",
    "the above estimation implies that old sbgs are @xmath110 times more numerous than classical sbgs . the entire palomar sbgs share 40% of the surveyed galaxies ( ho et al .",
    "1997a , b , c ) , while the markarian sbgs share 3% of the field galaxies ( balzano 1983 ) .",
    "the palomar sbgs with @xmath5 @xmath0 @xmath62 @xmath13 appear to be also dominated by old sbgs .",
    "the lower luminosity of their fir emission is attributable to a weaker starburst or a greater age . since",
    ", however , the _ iras _ fluxes of such objects could be contaminated by galaxy bulges and disks , we have not studied them .    our model does not explain the difference between the markarian and palomar sbgs in the spectral index @xmath22 , which depends primarily on the temperature of warm large grains @xmath53 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath22 is explained by the location of the warm large grains .",
    "a starburst region consists of star clusters . in young sbgs ,",
    "nonionizing photons are absorbed by grains in the vicinity of the individual clusters .",
    "however , in old sbgs , supernova - driven shocks have pushed away those grains , and nonionizing photons are of lower energies , i.e. , of longer wavelengths , and travel distances before absorbed by a grain .",
    "the absorption of nonionizing photons is due to grains which lie far from the clusters .",
    "since the radiation field there is weak , the grain temperature is expected to be low .",
    "the observed differences in the _ iras _ colors between the palomar and markarian sbgs are not attributable to a difference in the initial mass function .",
    "the initial mass function assumed in our calculation is consistent with most observations of star - forming and starburst regions , and thus expected to be universal ( leitherer 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , as stated above , the observed number of the markarian sbgs requires the presence of numerous old sbgs .",
    "the palomar sbgs exhibit low h@xmath28 luminosities , low [ ] 5007 / h@xmath32 ratios , high [ ] 6716  @xmath46 6731 / h@xmath28 ratios , and high [ ] 6300 / h@xmath28 ratios , as compared with classical sbgs .",
    "ho et al . (",
    "1997c ) already interpreted these properties in terms of old starbursts , where ionizing radiation is weak and of low excitation while supernova - driven shocks contribute to the [ ] and [ ] emissions . nevertheless , our analysis based on fir luminosities is essential to clarify the predominance of b stars in the palomar sbgs .",
    "since the beam size of the palomar survey is too small to compare its h@xmath28 luminosity with the fir luminosity , the spectral index @xmath21 alone allows us to study the stellar population of the whole starburst region .",
    "the palomar sbgs prefer hubble types equal to or later than sbc ( ho et al .",
    "1997b , c ) .",
    "we accordingly compare morphologies of the palomar sbgs with those of the markarian sbgs .",
    "most of them are available in de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . for the rest of the sbgs",
    ", we determine their morphologies on the basis of various references and optical images .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1@xmath63 .",
    "the markarian sbgs have earlier morphologies than the palomar sbgs ( ho et al .",
    "since the markarian sbgs have optically prominent nuclei , they could be misclassified as earlier types .",
    "however , there is another possibility .",
    "ho et al . ( 1997b ) found that early - type galaxies from e to sbc in the palomar survey preferentially harbor seyferts and liners , classes of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "young starbursts in early - type galaxies might tend to evolve into agns .",
    "the central engine of an agn is a supermassive black hole , which is known to prefer a galaxy with a significant stellar bulge , corresponding to a hubble type equal to or earlier than sbc ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "vigorous star formation is found around many agns . following glass & moorwood ( 1985 ) and mouri & taniguchi ( 1992 ) ,",
    "it is now established that these circumnuclear starbursts are older than those in classical sbgs ( moorwood 1996 ) .",
    "schmitt , storchi - bergmann , & cid fernandes ( 1999 ) estimated the typical age of the circumnuclear starburst as @xmath54 @xmath14 100 myr .",
    "very young starbursts do not exist around agns .",
    "the starburst occurs at radii of 1001000 pc , while the fueling of the central engine occurs at radii of @xmath64 1 pc .",
    "since it takes time to transport gas from the circumnuclear region to the nucleus , there is a delay between the onset of the starburst and that of the agn activity ( moorwood 1996 ; schmitt et al .",
    "however , except for this difference , starbursts around agns are similar to those in sbgs , if the latter objects are represented by the palomar sbgs .",
    "finally , we comment on objects in the _ iras _ bright galaxy survey ( @xmath65 @xmath16 5.24 jy ; soifer et al . 1989 ; see also sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the majority of these _ iras _ galaxies at @xmath5 @xmath0 10@xmath66 @xmath13 are sbgs . with the data of kim et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the median colors for 28 _ iras _ sbgs with @xmath5 = 10@xmath1210@xmath66 @xmath13 are estimated as @xmath21 = @xmath67 and @xmath22 = @xmath68 .",
    "they are , respectively , close to the median values for the palomar sbgs ( @xmath21 = @xmath69 ) and the markarian sbgs ( @xmath22 = @xmath70 ) .",
    "thus the _ iras _ sbgs are at intermediate starburst ages .",
    "the ionizing radiation has become weak , but the nonionizing radiation is still strong and heats significantly the warm large grains .",
