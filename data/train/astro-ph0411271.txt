    "the supermassive star , @xmath0 carinae , is now widely described as a binary system with a period of 5.5  years ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a collision between the wind from the primary star and the hidden companion forms a strong bow shock , which will produce hot x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the emission undergoes a flux minimum apparently coincident with periastron passage , which may be caused by partial or full eclipse by the wind of the primary star and/or collapse of the bow shock . during the minimum in 1997@xmath1298 ,",
    "the _ asca_satellite detected hard x - ray emission , characterized by similar _ kt_and _ n@xmath11_to the pre - minimum state with reduced plasma emission measure ( _ e.m . _ ) .",
    "the limited spatial resolution of _ asca _ , however , left the possibility that the observed emission was contaminated by emission from unresolved nearby sources .",
    "the latest x - ray minimum began at 2003 june 29 .",
    "it was monitored with three x - ray observatories , rxte , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton_(see corcoran et al .",
    ", this meeting , for the results of the rxte and _ chandra _  campaigns . ) of these observatories , _ xmm - newton_has the largest effective area , with moderate spatial and spectral resolution , and therefore is suitable for tracing changes in _ n@xmath11_and _ kt_. _ xmm - newton_observed @xmath0 carinae 1 ) 5 times in january 2003 before the minimum , which are treated as one set of data in our analysis , 2 ) twice in june 2003 prior to the minimum , near the x - ray maximum , 3 ) four times during the minimum in july and august 2003 , for a total of 11 observations .",
    "this paper reports on the results from the epic pn and mos ccd detectors .",
    "a _ chandra_observation by @xcite confirmed that hard x - ray emission during the x - ray minimum comes mainly from a point source at the position of @xmath0 carinae and partly from faint x - ray emission reflected from the homunculus nebula around @xmath0 carinae ( see the bottom left panel in figure  [ fig : xmmspectra ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , _ xmm - newton_cannot spatially resolve these components nor well separate the soft x - ray emission from the `` outer debris field '' beyond the homunculus , which is made by ancient ejecta interacting with the interstellar medium or previous ejecta .",
    "we therefore included all these components in the source region when extracting source events , and took background events from source free regions on the same ccd chip .",
    "background subtracted light curves above @xmath12  kev exhibited variation up to @xmath15% on timescales of @xmath130 ksec , which reflects emission from the central point source .",
    "the variation roughly agrees with the interpolated daily fluxes monitored with rxte    the epic pn spectra in figure  [ fig : xmmspectra ] demonstrate a strong decrease in hard x - ray emission up to a factor of @xmath1100 above 1  kev during the minimum , with no variation in the emission below 1  kev .",
    "this is similar to the _",
    "asca_results from the previous x - ray cycle @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the x - ray emission from the outer debris field and the homunculus nebula , neither of which varied on timescales of a month or longer , was estimated from the _ chandra_data on 2003 july 20 during the minimum , and is overlaid in figure  [ fig : xmmspectra ] . except for the excess below 1  kev ( which is produced by the poor absolute flux calibration between _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ ) , the excess above 1  kev should represent emission from the central source .    during the minimum",
    ", this emission shows a non - variable component between 13  kev . to estimate the physical properties of this non - variable component , we subtracted the x - ray emission from the outer debris field and the reflected emission from the homunculus from the spectra during the minimum , and simultaneously fit them by a two - temperature ( 2 t ) optically thin - thermal plasma ( apec ) model with independently absorbed 1 t non - variable and 1 t variable components .",
    "we also used the _",
    "chandra_spectra of the central region for the fitting .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the non - variable component are _",
    "kt_@xmath11  kev , _",
    "n@xmath11_@xmath15@xmath210@xmath8  @xmath4 , and log  _",
    "l@xmath13_@xmath134.2  ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "we extracted spectra of the variable component by subtracting this non - variable component in addition to the x - ray debris field and homunculus emission components ( figure  [ fig : xmmnormspectra ] ) . in the figure",
    ", we also display the best - fit model of the _ chandra_spectrum from september 26 when the minimum had just ended , and normalized all the spectra at the fe@xmath14 line energy .",
    "interestingly , the normalized spectra do not show any significant change in hard band slope above 7  kev , which is equivalent to a continuum temperature of _ kt_@xmath15  kev .",
    "meanwhile , the relative flux in the lower energy band decreased , with _ n@xmath11_increasing from 5@xmath210@xmath8  @xmath4 to 2@xmath210@xmath10  @xmath4 .",
    "the _ n@xmath11_increase was moderate , and is not large enough to account entirely for the strong flux decrease during the minimum , especially at energies @xmath15  kev .",
    "the flux decrease is more consistently described as an apparent decrease of _ e.m . _ as suggested in the earlier _",
    "asca_observations @xcite .",
    "this could either represent a real reduction in the amount of x - ray emitting plasma , or an obscuration of x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the flux during the minimum started to increase around july 22 , though _ n@xmath11_was still increasing , and _",
    "n@xmath11_continued to increase through the recovery on september 26 .",
    "n@xmath11_increase seems to lag the apparent _ e.m._decrease . in the spectra near the x - ray intensity maximum",
    ", the fe@xmath14 emission line seems to have a lower energy tail , which is also seen in the _",
    "chandra_hetg high resolution spectra ( see corcoran et al . ,",
    "this meeting ) .",
    "the feature seemed to be enhanced during the minimum though photon statistics were rather limited .",
    "this low energy tail may suggest that the ionization of the x - ray emitting plasma during the x - ray minimum may have been out of collisional equilibrium .",
    "the ews of the fe fluorescent line were 140220  ev before the minimum and were restricted to less than 700  ev during the minimum .",
    "the non - variable x - ray emission was stable for about two months during the minimum when the x - ray emission from the colliding winds exhibited prominent variation .",
    "the _ n@xmath11_of @xmath15@xmath210@xmath8  @xmath4is smaller than the columns to the colliding wind x - rays around the minimum and are the same as those in january and near apastron ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these results suggest that this emission component is remote from the binary system and not affected by the increasing column to the colliding wind source . on the other hand , _",
    "chandra_images during the minimum between 1@xmath123  kev , dominated by the non - variable x - ray emission , did not show any extended structure .",
    "the plasma size is therefore restricted to within @xmath11@xmath16 , equivalent to a physical size of @xmath12300  au assuming @xmath172.3  kpc .",
    "these results suggest that the x - ray plasma is produced by collision of a fast outflow with ambient gas relatively far from the star .",
    "a good candidate for this outflow is the polar wind from @xmath0 carinae , which has a high speed outflow up to @xmath11000 km  s@xmath5@xcite , which can produce plasma at temperatures near 1  kev .",
    "the series of the _ xmm - newton_observations confirmed that the spectral variations during the minimum are caused by a change in _ e.m .",
    "_ , and not the observed increase in _",
    "n@xmath11_(which is too low to provide the observed decline at @xmath18 kev ) .",
    "there are a number of ways in which this apparent reduction in x - ray brightness can be produced .",
    "one scenario is that the x - ray activity decayed close to the periastron passage , perhaps due to strong instabilities near periastron @xcite .",
    "however , while the behavior of the fe@xmath14 line suggests that the ionization balance of the plasma may be changing during the minimum , the hottest plasma temperature appears so stable that it does not support a dramatic decay of x - ray activity .",
    "an alternative is that the x - ray emission is only partially blocked by an optically thick absorber . in this scenario , the plasma _",
    "e.m._is apparently reduced during the x - ray minimum because the volume is mostly obscured from our line of sight .",
    "a partial or annular eclipse geometry seems unlikely because of the rapid change in geometry caused by the motion of the companion near periastron .",
