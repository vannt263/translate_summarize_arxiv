    "the hydrogen recombination line emission from the peculiar b[e ] star mwc349a is double - peaked at frequencies above 100  ghz , and is thought to be due to maser action in a gaseous rotating circumstellar disk .",
    "thermal continuum emission from radio to ir wavelengths reveals that the star also has an ionized outflow .",
    "maser action occurs in recombination lines from about 100  ghz ( h39@xmath0 ) to 1800  ghz ( h15@xmath0 ) and beyond @xcite .",
    "a physical model developed by @xcite suggests that the maser spots originate on the ionized surface of a rotating disk that is nearly edge - on in orientation . @xcite",
    "performed detailed radiative transfer modeling and concluded that the masers are probably unsaturated with a maximum negative opacity ( gain ) of about five .",
    "high resolution vla continuum images of mwc349a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) show an hourglass - shaped image whose angular size scales with frequency @xmath9 as @xmath10 and flux density as @xmath11 , as expected for a dense ionized outflow .",
    "the star is located in the waist of an hourglass - shaped gas structure , with the north - south lobes corresponding to outflows , and the putative rotating disk presumed to be located around the star and viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "it is interesting to note that vla continuum images spanning the period of 19962006 @xcite show that the continuum morphology of the object has evolved from an hourglass structure to a more of a rectangular projected structure ( i.e. , the waist of the hour glass structure is no longer prominent ) .",

    "for a distance of 1200 pc @xcite , the velocity and spatial separation between the two maser peaks of @xmath15 and 120 au respectively , and a central mass of about @xmath16 , can be inferred from kepler s third law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we present interferometric images of the maser emission in the h@xmath12 radio recombination line , which have much higher signal - to - noise ratios than those of previous investigations .",
    "this allows for the study of the distribution of maser emission in significantly greater detail .",
    "we have additional data from the sma in the h@xmath20 ( 353 ghz ) and h@xmath21 ( 652 ghz ) transitions .",

    "the weather was excellent for 230  ghz operations with @xmath22 varying between 0.05 and 0.07 during the night .",
    "the array was in the `` extended '' configuration with seven antennas in operation ( pads 1 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 ) providing baselines from 21 to 156 m. the synthesized beam at 230 ghz was 1@xmath232 by @xmath249 with a pa of 90@xmath25 .",
    "the correlator was configured in a hybrid mode .",
    "one 82 mhz `` chunk '' was centered on the maser emission and fed to a 512-channel cross correlator .",
    "the other 23 chunks were set at frequencies surrounding the maser band and fed to a bank of 32 channel correlators .",
    "the spectral resolution on the maser chunk was formally 0.24 mhz , but the data were averaged into bins at intervals of 0.76 mhz , exactly @xmath3 , covering a velocity range of @xmath26 to @xmath27 .    the observing schedule interspersed observations of mwc349a with the quasar calibrators 2013 + 370 , 2202 + 422 and 2232 + 117 . the sma correlator was configured to take 30 second scans .",
    "our observing cycle consisted of 24 scans on mwc349a , followed by 6 scans on each of the three quasar calibrators .",
    "2232 + 117 became available a little later than the other two quasars , and was the only quasar calibrator in the sky at the end of the track .",
    "after mwc349a set , we took 50 minutes of data on titan for absolute flux calibration . the total integration time on mwc349a was 4.8 hours .",
    "bandpass calibration was a crucial aspect of these observations , since the angular distribution of the maser emission is only about 0@xmath2305 , or one - twentieth of the synthesized beam .",
    "hence , after mwc349a set , over three hours of additional bandpass calibration data on venus and uranus was taken .",
    "we tested the stability of our bandpasses by dividing the venus data sets into two parts and calibrating one half with the other .",
    "we then did a vector average of the visibility spectra on all baselines in the calibrated portion of the data .",
    "the phase deviation from zero was less than @xmath28 across the band .",
    "this means that any systematic error in relative positions is less than 1/720 of the resolution , or about @xmath29 .",
    "data reduction was carried out with the software packages mir ( for flagging , bandpass , gain , and flux calibration ) and miriad ( for inverting the visibilities to form line images and applying the clean algorithm ) . in mir , data were first weighted by system temperature to account for sensitivity variations due to elevation and atmospheric changes .",
    "the bandpass calibration used all three quasars and three hours of high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) data from venus .",
    "the gain calibration used the interspersed data from the quasar 2013 + 370 .",
    "absolute flux calibration was achieved on the data from titan , whose flux density was estimated with the sma s online visibility calculator as 1.2  jy .",
    "the mwc349a data were exported in fits file format for further manipulation in miriad .",
    "the latter program was used to invert the visibilities to create line and continuum images .",

    "the vector - averaged visibility spectrum is shown in figure [ spectrum ] .",
    "the rms accuracy of our images at @xmath3 resolution was about 125 mjy .",
    "when making these observations , the phase center of the array was set to the published coordinates of mwc349a from the simbad database : ra@xmath30 and dec@xmath31 ( 2000 ) .",
    "these coordinates came from the catalog of h - alpha emission stars in the northern milky way published by @xcite .",

    "our position agrees well with the centroid position of the 7 mm continuum emission determined by @xcite of ra @xmath34 and dec@xmath35 ( 2000 ) for epoch 2004.9 .",
    "since the positions of the radio images are coincident to within their errors @xmath36 , we suspect that the apparent offset of the h@xmath0 position in declination is due to uncertainty in the optical measurement .",
    "all images in this paper are referenced to the 230 ghz position of the continuum emission .",
    "the spectrum of mwc349a closely follows the form of @xmath11 , and the angular size proportional to @xmath10 , indicative of a square law decrease in density with radius .",

    "a discussion of systematic errors that can result from this technique due to multiple unresolved features is described in section 5.4 .",
    "briefly , we found that if the spectral widths of individual masers are appropriate for unsaturated amplification with a gain of about 100 or more , then the position centroiding analysis ( pca ) method will give unbiased results . if , however , the high velocity emission near @xmath4 and @xmath5 is dominated by single components with amplification gain factors of only about five , then the distribution of components around the velocities will be biased and the inferred power law indices will be larger than the keplerian value of 0.5 .",
    "the formal error in the position estimate derived by the pca method is given by the equation @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the angular resolution ( beamwidth ) of the array and @xmath40 is the signal - to - noise ratio in the imaged velocity channel .",
    "hence , the accuracy of pca method can be much greater than the beamwidth for high values of @xmath40 .",
    "for the strongest feature of 42 jy , with rms noise of 125 mjy and resolution of 1@xmath232 , the formal centroiding accuracy is @xmath41 .",

    ", we refer to the emission in the spectral peaks ( i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) as `` high velocity '' emission , and the spectral range in between where the position changes linearly with position , as the  low velocity \" emission .",

    "we begin by reviewing the characteristics of a keplerian disk to frame the discussion .",
    "we find that the high velocity features follow a power - law distribution of the form @xmath51 , where @xmath0 is much larger than the keplerian index of 0.5 .",
    "we then show that the large power - law index can be understood if the masers are in keplerian motion , but distributed along spiral arms .",
    "finally , we present simulations to show the reliability of the centroiding method of determining relative maser positions to small fractions of the spatial resolution .",

    "masers at a fixed radius will extend along a straight line between the keplerian limits where @xmath63 .",
    "for a disk with maser emission bounded by an inner and outer radii of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the masers will lie within a `` bowtie '' region in the position - velocity diagram , bounded by the straight lines defined by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively ( see figure [ cartoon ] ) .",
    "features lying along the curved outer boundaries arise on the `` midline '' where @xmath68 .",
    "the distribution of masers in the actual p - v diagram suggests the masers are in three regions : approximately along the midline , one region on either side of the star , and in a relatively thin annular region of radius equal to about the outer radius ( 0@xmath23025 , or about 30 au ) as traced by the high velocity masers .",
    "it is not possible to tell whether masers in this annular region come from the front side or back side of the disk .",
    "however , if they are spread out on both sides , then the ratio of the minor to the major axis , which is about 0.25 , suggests that the disk is tilted by about 15@xmath25 to the line of sight .",
    "if the front side of the disk is tipped down , as suggested by @xcite with respect to us , there appears to be a deficit of masers on the front side of the disk ( see figure [ spotvrah30 ] ) .",

    "the actual distribution of masers in the diagram crosses these three curves ; hence , it is difficult to assign a specific mass without a more complex model ( see section 5.4 ) .",
    "we can characterize the `` keplerian '' wings by a power law model of the form    @xmath70    we have used the ra positions for @xmath57 . since this equation is nonlinear in the parameters , we solved for their values through a chi - square minimization technique .",

    "because of the symmetry imposed in the fit ( i.e. , both sides of the p - v diagram ) are assumed to have the same power law index , the centroid of the p - v diagram is moved to the apparently off - centered location as shown .",
    "the systemic velocity is @xmath76 in this model , significantly offset from the mean velocity of the maser emission of @xmath77 and the central position is 0@xmath78 offset from the continuum peak .",
    "the masers lie in the angular region of radii of about @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "note , however , that the outer edge is defined by the blueshifted features while the inner edge is defined by the redshifted features , and neither side of the disk is completely filled .",

    "positional symmetry could be restored if the power law indices for the red and blue features were allowed to be different .",

    "a possible explanation could be that the disk is undergoing a magnetically powered spin up .",
    "@xcite measured the line - of - sight magnetic field strength in the masing gas to be 22 mg . if the masers lie on the midline of a rotating disk , this field would correspond to a toroidal component . even if the mass of the disk is assumed to be 30  @xmath62 ,",
    "the kinetic energy is considerably less than both magnetic and thermal energy ; hence , the magnetic field may control the dynamics .",

    "we have chosen to put the red features on the near side of the disk , in order to allow a trailing spiral arm configuration .",

    "note that the apparent pa of the masers is about @xmath87 .",
    "the large scale ionization structure suggests that the inclination angle is @xmath88 ( disk tipped down in front ) @xcite , and the position angle of the dust is about @xmath89 .",
    "these orientations would mean that the maser disk is misaligned with the dust structure and the large scale structure of the ionized gas by about @xmath90 in both pa and @xmath91 .",
    "an alternative model would be that the masers are tracing a leading spiral structure .",
    "the pa would still need to be about @xmath86 , but the inclination angle would be @xmath88 ( tipped down in front ) .",
    "we note that the spiral arms in most spiral galaxies are trailing . however , there are a few known examples of leading spiral arms ( e.g. , ngc4622 , * ? ? ?",
    "we favor the trailing spiral model with the front side of the disk tipped up .",
    "we selected a spiral structure of the form @xmath92 to approximate the maser distribution .",
    "the fitted spiral model is shown in figure [ spiral ] .",
    "we will not explore or attempt to justify the existence of a spiral structure in the envelope of mwc349a .",
    "however , we mention that @xcite have developed a theory of spiral arms to explain the appearance of the circumstellar dust disks of hd100546 and hd141569 . note , however , that the toomre q parameter associated with the ionized disk of mwc349a is much greater than unity because the surface density of the ionized portion of the disk is so small .",

    "* ) . in this case",
    "each maser feature , which occupies a unique velocity range , appears as an unresolved `` spot . '' even in the case where the features are well resolved in velocity only , but not in position , this technique is very effective .",
    "for example , in ngc4258 , the features are well separated in velocity over a range of @xmath107 with line widths of about @xmath3 , but not angular extent where the angular extent for the low velocity masers is 1 mas and the instrumental resolution is about 200 @xmath108as ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    in the case of mwc349a",
    ", the maser spectrum has a rather simple appearance , dominated by two almost perfectly gaussian shaped profiles centered at 32 and @xmath109 .",
    "although the instrumental resolution of the sma is much finer than the linewidths of these features , their profiles do not reveal any substructure .",
    "hence , the maser is resolved neither in velocity nor position , and the interpretation of centroided images must be made with caution and insight .",
    "systematic artifacts , such as the appearance of a velocity gradient in a source that is actually composed of two components closely spaced in velocity and position is well known . for example , @xcite have shown that a source of molecular emission ( non - maser ) in w3(h@xmath110o ) , thought to be a gradient indicative of rotational motion , was in fact a double source whose components have slightly different velocities .    in this section ,",
    "we report the results of the simulations we have made for mwc349a following the methodology of @xcite to investigate the effects of source blending . since the structure we have discussed in this paper is essentially one dimensional ( i.e. , along a line with position angle of about 102@xmath25 ) , we have done only a simulation in one positional coordinate .",

    "a key characteristic of this model is that the three components in each of the keplerian wings are dominated by a strong component . in the centroid analysis ,",
    "the strong component `` pulls '' the position of each of the weaker components so as to steepen the slope of the p - v diagram .    in the nine - component model we chose line widths of 4 - 5 @xmath61 which is reasonable for a thermal gas at @xmath115k , where an unsaturated maser gain of about 5 , narrows the thermal linewidth by a factor of @xmath116",
    ". however , a better model might be one of many more components that are intrinsically much narrower ( i.e. , resulting from higher maser gain of @xmath117 ) but add up to an approximately gaussian profile of about @xmath118 width . in this case the spectral range of influence of each component will be relatively small and the centroiding would not affect the p - v diagram significantly .",

    "the position - velocity diagram from the simulation is shown with the data ( also shown in figure [ 3masskepler ] ) . in the bottom panels the simulated spectrum",
    "is plotted with the observed spectrum for each model .",
    "the nine component model has 35 parameters .",
    "these parameters were not determined by least - mean - square fitting , but chosen to show an approximate fit and to demonstrate the characteristics of the model .",
    "[ centroids ] ]    instances of power law indices in p - v diagrams of under - resolved images of masers calculated from pca analyses have been reported by others in the literature .",
    "examples of these are the ch3oh maser emission in dr(21)n by @xcite , and the sio maser in the late type star r aquarii by @xcite    we note that w.j .",
    "welch and s.  white ( private communication ) have also imaged mwc349a in the same transition with the bima array in its highest resolution mode of 0@xmath231 .",
    "their image is very similar to ours , with a gradient at low velocities and `` keplerian '' wings , although the centroiding is less accurate because of the somewhat lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "although their resolution was still insufficient to resolve the masers , we are greatly encouraged that our results are consistent . in addition , @xcite presented maser images with the plateau - de - bure interferometer at a recent conference , which clearly shows the linear structure of the systemic features .",
    "they also measured features beyond our range ( @xmath119 ) which are offset from the linear structure and may be due to a wind component .",
    "as can be seen in figure 8 ( lower right panel ) our spectrum shows significant power beyond @xmath120 and @xmath121 that was too weak for us to find accurate positions for , which could be part of a wind component .",
    "we have presented a new high resolution image of the maser features in the inner ionized envelop of mwc349a .",
    "the masers act as tracers of the velocity distribution in the disk .",
    "we used the pca method to determine the positions of the maser spots to an accuracy much finer than the resolution of the interferometer . based on our simulations",
    "we find that there are two plausible interpretations to our data . in both models",
    "the linear distribution of masers in the p - v diagram between @xmath122 and @xmath123 suggests the presence of an annular ring of maser emission with a radius of about @xmath124 .",
    "the scatter is due to measurement noise , intrinsic thickness in the annular masing region , and inclination of the ring .",
    "if the high velocity maser components have linewidths of about @xmath118 , then the simulations of the pca method indicate that they may lie along the midline .",
    "if , on the other hand , these components have much narrower intrinsic linewidths because of higher maser amplification , then they may be distributed along spiral structures .",
    "if the maser components are the result of the unsaturated amplification , then their brightness temperatures will be much greater than the thermal temperature of the gas by a factor of exp(g ) , where g is the maser gain factor .",
    "thus , these masers may be observable at much higher resolution .",
    "alma , in its extended configuration of 10 km , could be used to observe mwc349 ( which will have a maximum elevation angle of about 30@xmath25 ) at a resolution of about @xmath125 at 230 ghz , and could distinguish between the models we have proposed .",
    "we thank henrik beuther , chunhua qi , david fong , mark gurwell , and jun - hui zhao for help with the preparation of the observing script as well as the data calibration and reduction .",
    "we are grateful to the astute remarks of the anonymous referee who urged us to look more deeply into the simulations reported here and made other very useful suggestions .",
    "we thank william danchi for providing digital data for figures 1 and 4 , and yolanda gmez and daniel tofoya for providing the digital image for figure 1 .",
    "jack welch encouraged us to carry out a simulation of centroiding analysis and showed us the bima images of mwc349a , and vladimir strelnitski discussed radiative transfer issues and dynamical models with us .",
    "we also benefited from discussions with naama dror , yolanda gmez , luis rodrguez , howard smith and daniel tafoya .",

    "<S> the two strongest maser components ( called high velocity components ) at velocities near @xmath4 and @xmath5 are separated by @xmath6 ( 60 au ) along a position angle of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of maser emission at velocities between and beyond these two strongest components were also provided . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum emission lies at the center of the maser distribution to within 10 mas . </S>",
    "<S> the masers appear to trace a nearly edge - on rotating disk structure , reminiscent of the water masers in keplerian rotation in the nuclear accretion disk of the galaxy ngc4258 . however , the maser components in mwc349a do not follow a simple keplerian kinematic prescription with @xmath8 , but have a larger power law index . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility that the high velocity masers trace spiral density or shock waves . we also emphasize caution in the interpretation of relative centroid maser positions where the maser is not clearly resolved in position or velocity , and we present simulations that illustrate the range of applicability of the centroiding method . </S>"
