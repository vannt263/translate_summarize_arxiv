    "x - ray absorption lines of , , and/or  at @xmath4 have been detected unambiguously toward several bright agns , but the nature of these highly - ionized species remains uncertain . because of the limited spectral resolution of the current grating instruments on board the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton x - ray observatories _",
    "( fwhm @xmath5 m , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of 750 km  s@xmath6 at 20   ) , however , the line width and centroid position do not directly constrain the absorbing gas to be any significantly better than a few mpc .",
    "some authors have attributed these @xmath4 absorptions to the so - called warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) in the local group or even beyond ( e.g. , nicastro et al .",
    "2002 ; rasmussen et al .  2003 ; williams et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this interpretation",
    ", the hot phase medium could contain large amounts of baryonic matter , accounting for the bulk of the `` missing baryons '' , as predicted in numerical simulations of large - scale structure formations ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "but , the @xmath4 , , and/or  absorption lines have also been observed in x - ray spectra of the lmc x-3 at distance of 50 kpc ( wang et al .",
    "2005 ) and many galactic sources ( e.g. , futamoto et al .  2004 ;",
    "yao & wang 2005 ; juett et al .",
    "the strength of the absorption toward such a source , depending its galactic coordinates and pathlength , can be substantially greater than those toward the agns . a crude characterization of the global distribution of the absorbing hot gas gives an effective scale length of several kpc , suggesting that much of the observed absorptions originates in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the recent surveys of agn spectra with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ archive data show that the  absorption line is present in all high quality spectra @xcite , indicating a covering fraction of  absorbing gas @xmath7 in the sky .",
    "this high covering fraction , together with an estimation of the total mass of the absorbing gas and with a comparison between emission and absorption measurements , further supports the scenario that the x - ray absorbers are primarily associated with the galaxy @xcite .",
    "there is really little doubt as to the presence of the galactic contribution to the x - ray absorption .",
    "the question is how much .",
    "while the line absorption depends on the ionic column density and the dispersion velocity of the intervening hot gas , the emission is sensitive to the number density and temperature of the gas .",
    "therefore a combination of absorption and emission measurements naturally provides a constraint to the scale length of the absorbing / emitting plasma . @xcite and @xcite have indeed compared the observed  absorption with the background  emission line intensity @xcite to estimate the scale length of the hot gas around the galaxy .",
    "similar estimates are also made by @xcite .",
    "but , so far such estimates all depend on various",
    "_ assumptions _ such as absorption in the linear regime and isothermality of the hot gas , which may not be valid ( see  [ sec : absline ] and  4 for further discussion ) .",
    "here we report the first systematic joint - analysis of x - ray absorption and emission data , complemented by a far - uv ovi absorption measurement , in the direction of mrk  421 .",
    "the joint - analysis allows for tests of the assumptions and provide tight constraints on our spectral models .",
    "our goals are to characterize both the scale length and global thermal property of the @xmath8 absorbing / emitting hot gas toward mrk  421 .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the statistical errors are quoted at the 90% confidence level , unless being pointed out specifically .",
    "we also adopt the solar abundance given by @xcite for oxygen .",
    "mrk  421 is one of the brightest quasars at @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and its x - ray flux varies by up to @xmath11 times between quiescent to burst states .",
    "table  [ tab : observation ] lists the existing nine _ chandra _ observations of mrk  421 , covering various flux levels of the source .",

    "we combine six long exposures of these observations to enhance the counting statistics ( by @xmath15 ) ; the other three observations , which we do not use , have short exposures , contributing only @xmath16 to the total recorded counts around the wavelength of  k@xmath13 ( the most significant absorption line ) .",
    "furthermore , the letg - acis combination suffers no grating order over - lapping complexity as the letg - hrc does , allowing for a sensitive cross - checking of the measurements between the acis - s and hrc - s observations ( see below and  4 ) .",

    "a higher  k@xmath13/k@xmath18 ew ratio indicates a small saturation of the  k@xmath13 absorption and therefore requires a large @xmath112 , which then becomes consistent with the value of the  line . jointly analyzing the absorption and emission data , we have shown here that the data can be explained by the galactic hot gas .",
    "savage et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have explored the _ fuse _ spectra of mrk  421 and two nearby stars bd  + 38@xmath1132182 ( @xmath114 ) and hd  93521 ( @xmath115 ) in great detail .",
    "they have examined the relationships of the absorption by  to those by lowly - ionized species ( e.g. , , , , and ) as well as to those by highly - ionized ones (  and ) .",
    "the observed `` broad ''  absorption is divided into the two different velocity components , from -140 to 60 km s@xmath6 and from 60 to 165 km s@xmath6 .",
    "a good correlation between the positive high - velocity  component and low ionization gas absorptions is found .",
    "interestingly , the high - velocity   component does not seem to show up in the spectra of the two stars .",
    "if these sight - lines are not atypical , the positive high velocity absorption should then occur at a distance at least 3.5 kpc off the galactic plane . in this case",
    ", the absorption can not arise from the same location as the - and -absorbing gas .",
    "some portion of the observed  absorptions should be associated with the -bearing gas , which we assume to be located in a thick hot gaseous disk . to further probe this association , we reprocessed the _ fuse _ observations of bd  + 38@xmath1132182 , following the standard calfuse scripts .",
    "we find that the main  absorption along the sigh line can be characterized as a narrow component with @xmath116 and log@xmath117=14.20(14.17 , 14.22)$ ] .",
    "however , because the continuum placement is very arbitrary ( see zsarg et al .",
    "2003 and savage et al .",
    "2005 for further discussions ) , this characterization is very uncertain .",
    "a careful check suggests that up to 30% of the broad  line absorption observed in mrk  421 can be superposed on the narrow line easily seen in the spectrum of bd  + 38@xmath1132182 .",
    "this `` common '' broad component could be associated with the -bearing gas .",
    "the remaining  line absorptions in the sight - lines toward the star and of mrk  421 could then arise in the discrete interfaces at boundaries of cool clouds , emersed in hot gas @xcite ; the apparent broadening observed in mrk  421 may be due to the superposition of different velocity components over a large distance .",
    "the true absorption and emission of the gas should be a convolution of the local temperature and density dispersions with the global dependences on the off - plane distance .",
    "but currently there is little observational or theoretical guidances as to the specific forms of the dispersions .",
    "our simple exponential model , hopefully , provides a first - order correction to the isothermal assumption , or at least demonstrates that the non - isothermality of the hot gas should be seriously explored .    to examine the influence of the `` common '' component on our results , we perform the same joint analysis as in  [ sec : nim ] , but requiring the hot gaseous disk accounts for only 30% of the total  absorption detected in the mkr  421 sight - line .",
    "the constrained parameter ranges are very similar to those illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_tmax ] ( d)-(f ) , except for a slightly larger @xmath85 and a smaller @xmath68 values .",
    "clearly , we can not unambiguously determine the exact fraction of the observed  absorption that may be associated with x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "but this uncertainty is not expected to qualitatively affect our results and conclusions about the overall non - isothermality and extent of the x - ray - emitting / absorbing gas .",
    "the above analysis and results show that the gas that produces the x - ray line absorption and emission along the sight - line toward mrk  421 is consistent with a galactic hot thick disk interpretation . but based on the data for this single sight - line , we can not conclusively determine the location of the gas .",
    "as mentioned above , alternative scenarios ( i.e. galactic halo and local group ) of the @xmath4 -bearing gas have been proposed , allowed for by the limited spectral resolution of the x - ray grating observations .",
    "so let us review and discuss the merit and implications of these proposals .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite adopted a local group whim interpretation and found a consistent scale length of @xmath29 mpc of the gas in the sight lines of pks 2155 - 304 and mrk  421 .",
    "this consistency is partly a natural outcome of the low - density assumption , hence the importance of the photo - ionization by the extragalactic background in determining the ionic fractions of the gas .",
    "this interpretation , however , requires the whim to be either metal - rich ( e.g. , @xmath118 solar ) or severely ( spherical ) asymmetric ( i.e. , a small sky - covering - fraction @xmath119 ) , or both @xcite , because otherwise the derived total baryonic matter in the local group would be even higher than its gravitational mass ( @xmath120 ; courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a systematic search for the  absorption line in agn spectra from archived _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ data and found that the  absorption line is detected significantly as long as the counting statistic is reasonably good .",
    "they concluded that @xmath119 is @xmath7 and likely to be unit .",
    "this large @xmath119 is clearly contradictory to the requirement of the whim interpretation that @xmath119 must be @xmath121 even assuming the solar metallicity for the hot gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the whim scenario is very unlikely , if not impossible , to explain the bulk of the -bearing gas .",
    "alternatively , hot gas is also expected to be present in the galactic halo on a scale of @xmath122 kpc .",
    "such a hot gaseous galactic halo is predicted in galaxy formation theories .",
    "such gas is heated at the so - called virial shocks and through subsequent gravitational compression ( e.g. , birnboim & dekel 2003 ) .",
    "this gas , cooling radiatively , can maintain lasting star formation in galactic disks .",
    "but simulations tend to over - predict the cooled gas content in galactic disks , which is the so - called `` over - cooling '' problem ( e.g. , navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "the inclusion of galactic energy feedback may alleviate the problem , although this has not been satisfactorily demonstrated .",
    "observationally , the existence of a hot gaseous halo around our galaxy is supported by observations of high velocity ( hv ; @xmath123 ) clouds ( hvcs ) .",
    "some of these clouds , especially compact ones , appear to be located far away from the galactic plane , although tight distance constraints are very few .",
    "the hot gaseous halo may be needed to confine such clouds and may even be their origin through condensation .",
    "furthermore , hv  absorption lines are sometimes associated with hvcs and are believed to be produced at their interfaces with the hot halo gas @xcite .",
    "so far , however , there is little observational evidence for a large - scale diffuse x - ray - emitting or -absorbing halo around our galaxy or other similar disk galaxies ( see wang 2006 for a review ) , consistent with the conclusion reached in the present work . a scenario that reconciles these observations",
    "is that much of the hot halo gas is very low in metallicity , because both the x - ray emission and absorption arise from metal ions .",
    "such a galactic hot gaseous halo with low metallicity may be a natural product of the strong selective radiative cooling if the accreted gas has a distribution of metal abundances ; the gas with a higher metal abundance cools faster and forms denser clouds ( probably hvcs ) , whereas the remaining gas tends to have zero or low metallicity , especially in inner regions of galactic halos .",
    "this scenario explains the low x - ray emission / absorption of the hot halo gas and further alleviates the over - cooling problem .",
    "a detailed modeling of the scenario will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we favor the interpretation that the bulk of the @xmath8 -bearing gas represents a hot thick gaseous disk around the milky way , consistent with previous studies as well as the present one . in this case",
    ", the gas represents the hot phase of the ism and is presumably heated primarily by supernova blastwaves .",
    "the presence of the gas is also traced by  absorption . as its ionic fraction peaks at @xmath124",
    "k ,  is believed to present primarily at interfaces between cool and hot gases and/or in hot gas cooling .",
    "the  line absorption is observed ubiquitously at relatively low velocity ( lv ; @xmath125 ) , clearly indicating a predominantly galactic disk origin @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the  absorption indeed has a characteristic vertical scale height of @xmath126 kpc around the galactic plane @xcite and is thus in a good agreement with that of the hotter -bearing gas .",
    "therefore , the presence of the hot thick gaseous disk is fully expected and provides a natural explanation for much of the x - ray / far - uv absorption and emission .",
    "the hot thick gaseous disk interpretation is also supported by the x - ray emission observations of nearby disk galaxies like our own .",
    "both the intensity and spatial extent of diffuse x - ray emission appear to be correlated with star formation in galactic disks .",
    "typically the emission is confined to galactic coronae around the disks with vertical extent no more than a few kpc ( e.g. , @xcite , wang et al .",
    "2003 ) . for ease of comparison with these studies , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : surface ] the emission intensity distribution as a function of the vertical distance away from the galactic plane with the best - fit parameters of the hot thick gaseous disk (  [ sec : nim ] ) . because the @xmath85 is not well constrained",
    ", the distribution for several specific @xmath85 values are included . for a very broad range of @xmath85 ,",
    "the emission is essentially concentrated within a few kpc off - plane distance .",
    "this concentration is consistent with those findings in the nearby disk galaxies @xcite , suggesting a common behavior and a common nature of hot gas in these galaxies .    to summarize ,",
    "we have carried out a systematic investigation of the available x - ray  and  absorption / emission tracers of galactic diffuse hot gas in the field of mrk  421",
    ". a joint analysis of the data , complemented by the _ fuse _ measurement , enables us for the first time to self - consistently and simultaneously characterize the non - isothermality and vertical scale height of the hot gas in the sight - line toward mrk  421 .",
    "we have established that the x - ray - emitting / absorbing hot gas can not be in an isothermal state .",
    "but the x - ray data can be explained with a hot gaseous disk model , which is meant to provide a simple , yet physically plausible characterization of the global temperature and density distributions of the hot gas .",
    "indeed , our inferred scale height of the hot gaseous disk and the gas density at the galactic plane are consistent with our previous estimations based on the galactic latitude dependence of galactic  line absorptions observed @xcite .",
    "we thank dan mccammon and claude canizares for useful discussions and the second referee for insightful comments and constructive suggestions , which helped to improve our presentation of the paper .",
    "we are also grateful to michael nowak for investigating the possible differences in measuring absorption line equivalent width in isis , xspec , and sherpa . this work is supported by nasa through the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao )",
    "contract sv3 - 73016 to mit for support of the chandra x - ray center , which is operated by the sao for and on behalf of nasa under contract nas 08 - 03060 .",
