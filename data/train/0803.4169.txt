    "monte - carlo evaluations of a 2d heisenberg square lattice with an additional interlayer exchange coupling energy @xmath3 reproduce the data quantitatively ; the degree of concavity depends on the effective dimensionality of the system , whilst the field at which the `` elbow '' occurs is an accurate measure of the in - plane exchange energy @xmath4 . using these @xmath4 values in conjunction with nel temperatures deduced from muon - spin rotation ( @xmath13sr )",
    ", it is then possible to gain a good estimate of the exchange anisotropy @xmath5 for all of the magnets .    having established these findings using the whole range of compounds , we suggest that in magnets of the form [ cu(hf@xmath6)(pyz)@xmath6]x ,  @xcite where x is an anion , @xmath4 and @xmath3 may be influenced by the tilting of the pyrazine ( pyz ) molecule with respect to the 2d planes .",

    "estimates of ground state observables are obtained by using sufficiently large values of the inverse @xmath1 , @xmath41 .",
    "we have further found that the statistics of the data obtained can be significantly improved by the use of a tempering scheme  @xcite .",

    "we first discuss whether the x anions can play a direct role as exchange pathways between the cu@xmath11 ions .",
    "first of all , the anions [ clo@xmath14]@xmath77 and [ bf@xmath14]@xmath77 have radically different electronic orbitals , and yet the intralayer exchange energies for the magnets containing these anions are very similar ( see the first three rows of table  [ table1 ] ) . moreover , as mentioned above , the x anions are not within the 2d cu@xmath11 planes , but at body - center positions within the `` cubes '' ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the cu-(anion ) separation is therefore roughly the same for the interlayer and intralayer directions ; if the anions played a direct role as exchange pathways , one might expect that the [ cu(hf@xmath6)(pyz)@xmath6]x compounds would have @xmath5 values that were somewhat larger ( i.e. more isotropic ) than the values @xmath87 that are actually observed ( see table  [ table1 ] ) . therefore , instead of playing a direct role in the exchange",
    ", it is more likely that it is an anion _ size effect _ on the crystal structure that is affecting the exchange pathways .",
    "the structural difference that may well be responsible for the factor of two change in @xmath4 is the configuration of the pyrazine molecules within the cu-(pyz)-cu linkages .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( upper ) shows [ cu(hf@xmath6)(pyz)@xmath6]sbf@xmath53 , one of the systems with octahedral anions ; the structures of x = asf@xmath53 , pf@xmath53 are very similar . at room temperature ,",
    "the larger size of the octahedral anions compared to the tetrahedral examples forces the pyrazine ligands to stand up virtually perpendicular to the @xmath75 planes  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the planes of the pyrazine ligands in the compounds with the smaller tetrahedral anions , [ cu(hf)@xmath6(pyz)@xmath6]bf@xmath14 ( fig",
    ".  [ fig4 ] ( lower ) ) and [ cu(hf)@xmath6(pyz)@xmath6]clo@xmath14 , are not perpendicular to the @xmath75 plane , but are tilted away by @xmath80 ( x = bf@xmath14 ) or @xmath88 ( x = clo@xmath14 ) in a pattern that preserves the four - fold symmetry of the cu@xmath11 sites  @xcite .",
    "as one lowers the temperature  @xcite , the tilt of the pyrazine ligands increases in all of the compounds ( i.e. those with octahedral and tetrahedral anions ) ; however , in the case of the octahedral anions , space - filling considerations restrict the tilt to values in the range @xmath89 ( x = pf@xmath53 ) to @xmath90 ( x = asf@xmath53 ) .",
    "this suggests that it may be the orientation dependence of the pyrazine ligand that produces the factor two difference in @xmath4 , with the more perpendicularly - disposed pyrazines ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) presenting a more efficient exchange pathway within the layers .",
    "magnetization experiments have been carried out on nine organic cu - based 2d heisenberg magnets .",
    "these systems exhibit a low-@xmath1 magnetization that is concave as a function of field , with a sharp `` elbow '' transition to a constant saturation value at a critical field @xmath2 .",
    "monte - carlo simulations including interlayer exchange quantitatively reproduce the data ; the concavity indicates the effective dimensionality and @xmath2 is an accurate measure of the in - plane exchange energy @xmath4 . taken in conjunction with nel temperatures derived from muon - spin rotation , the values of @xmath4 may be used to obtain quantitative estimates of the exchange anisotropy , @xmath5 .",
    "we suggest that in organic magnets of the form [ cu(hf@xmath6)(pyz)@xmath6]x , where x is an anion molecule , the sizes of @xmath4 and @xmath3 may be controlled by the tilting of the pyrazine molecule with respect to the 2d planes .",
    "thus , it may be possible to use molecular architecture to design magnets with very specific values of @xmath4 , tailored to a particular desired property .",
    "one possible application would be an organic magnet designed to simulate the antiferromagnetic interactions germane to cuprate superconductivity  @xcite , but with exchange energies small enough to permit manipulation of the magnetic groundstate using standard laboratory fields .",
