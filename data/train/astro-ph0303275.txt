    "`` superthin '' galaxies appear `` needle - like '' on the sky because of their edge - on orientation , highly flattened stellar disks ( @xmath1810 ) and ( near ) absence of a discernable spheroidal component ( vorontsov - velyaminov  1967 ) . a spectrophotometric study showed them to have gas - rich , optically diffuse disks with little internal absorption , as well as low emission - line intensity ratios and slowly rising rotation curves ( goad & roberts  1981 ) .",
    "therefore , many of the so - called superthins are late - type , low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies seen at high inclination ( matthews , gallagher , & van  driel  1999 ; dalcanton & bernstein  2000 ; see also gerritsen & de  blok  1999 ) .",
    "they seem to be among the least evolved disk galaxies in the local universe , having undergone only minimal dynamical heating , star formation , and angular momentum transport ( bergvall & rnnback 1995 ; matthews et al .",
    "1999 ; dalcanton & bernstein  2000 ) .",
    "in addition , their orientation and simple structure make superthins ideal laboratories for probing how galaxy disk structure and morphology are influenced by internal and external processes .",
    "observational and theoretical arguments suggest that disk structure and thickness are affected by environment ( tth & ostriker  1992 ; odewahn  1994 ; reshetnikov & combes  1997 ; schwarzkopf & dettmar  2001 ) and imply that a disk must remain isolated in order to remain `` superthin . ''",
    "this is often observed , as most galaxies with @xmath19 are devoid of close neighbors ( karachentsev 1999 ; matthews & van  driel  2000 ) .",
    "however , some exceptions do exist ( duc et al .",
    "2000 ; hibbard et al .  2001 ; matthews & uson  2002 ) .",
    "since superthin galaxies are rich in neutral hydrogen ( ) gas ( giovanelli , avera , & karachentsev  1997 ; matthews & van  driel  2000 ) , imaging observations of the  ( 21-cm ) line emission can be used to test whether these objects have truly remained isolated throughout their lifetimes .",
    "dynamical timescales of the outer regions of the gaseous disks of galaxies are longer than those of their stellar disks ; hence signatures of past perturbations and interactions such as warps and gas asymmetries can be preserved in the  distribution , even when none are obvious in the stellar disk ( rix & zaritsky  1995 ) .",
    "in addition , high - sensitivity  observations can uncover the presence of previously unseen gas - rich companions which ( if present ) might also play a role in the evolution of these disks .",
    "we can gain further insight into the nature of superthin galaxies by comparing  images with data obtained at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , measurements of the thickness of the stellar and gaseous disks of superthins are of considerable interest in understanding the evolution of these galaxies . while the stellar scale - heights of superthin disks are typically found to be quite small ( @xmath20200 pc , matthews 2000 ; but see also van  der  kruit et al .",
    "2001 ) , this does not necessarily mean that their gas disks are also unusually thin , since gaseous and stellar disks are affected by different heating processes .",
    "comparison of the structure and scale heights of the gas disks of superthins with those of other types of galaxies should constrain how the dynamically coldest disks are stabilized , and what mechanisms are responsible for heating and supporting their ism component , especially in the absence of significant energy input from massive star formation ( sellwood & balbus  1999 ; snchez - salcedo  2001 ) .",
    "since the stellar disks of these galaxies remain so thin , internal as well as external heating processes must be suppressed in them , including ` firehose ' instabilities ( fridman & polyachenko  1984 ) , bar formation ( mihos et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the development of spiral arms ( noguchi 1987 ) .",
    "in addition , their stability requires the presence of a massive dark halo ( efstathiou , lake and negroponte  1982 ) .",
    "in fact , superthins should be amongst the most dark - matter dominated of disk galaxies ( zasov , makarov , & mikhailova  1991 ; gerritsen & de  blok  1999 ) .",
    "however , constraints on the dark matter content of edge - on superthin disks have been derived for only a few objects such as ngc  4244 ( olling  1996 ) .",
    "existing optical rotation curve studies of superthins typically show a slow rise throughout much of the stellar disk ( e.g. , goad & roberts  1981 ; makarov et al .",
    "1997 ) ; but only observations permit the derivation of the extended outer disk rotation curves which are necessary to constrain the mass models and dark matter halo parameters . for superthins , such analyses are not complicated by the presence of a bulge component , and the mass contributions of stellar disks are expected to be low , making them particularly well - suited for probing the shape of the distribution of dark matter in these galaxies ( olling 1995 ) .    in spite of the unique information that can be gleaned from detailed studies of edge - on spiral galaxies , only a small number of these have been imaged in the  line with high sensitivity and high spatial and spectral resolution ( e.g. , rupen 1991 ; olling 1996 ; swaters , sancisi , & van der hulst  1997 ; garca - ruiz , sancisi , & kuijken  2002 ) . moreover , with the exception of olling ( 1996 ) , the most sensitive  imaging observations of edge - on galaxies to date have concentrated on massive , luminous systems of mid - to - early hubble type rather than on moderate - to - low mass and/or lsb systems like the superthins .",
    "this paper is the first in a series describing new high - sensitivity imaging observations of superthin galaxies with moderate optical luminosities ( @xmath21  ) , moderate masses ( @xmath22100  ) , and highly flattened disks ( @xmath2310 ) .",
    "the galaxies that we have observed are undergoing differing levels of perturbation from a companion , ranging from being isolated to being strongly perturbed , and show differing levels of current star formation . in this paper",
    ", we present our study of ugc  7321 , an isolated superthin galaxy which offers a unique perspective on the ism structure of an lsb disk viewed edge - on . by comparing its  properties to those of other lsb and edge - on spiral galaxies , and",
    "ultimately , to the results to be presented in our following papers , we aim to address many of the questions discussed above  i.e . , to gain clues on the formation histories of pure disk galaxies and probe how environmental factors , interactions , and internal processes influence the structure , evolution , and star formation histories of late - type disk galaxies .",
    "ugc  7321 is a highly inclined ( @xmath24 ) sd spiral galaxy .",
    "its distance is somewhat uncertain , with estimates ranging from @xmath105  mpc from a kinematical model of the local supercluster ( tully , shaya , & pierce  1992 ) to 14.9  mpc using the @xmath25-band tully - fisher relation ( garca - ruiz et al .",
    "one of us ( ldm ) has used the _ hubble space telescope _ to obtain images of ugc  7321 in collaboration with j.  s.  gallagher ( wisconsin ) for a different project .",
    "they estimate that ugc  7321 is located at a distance in the range of ( 7  13 )  mpc based on the brightest resolved stars . in this paper , we adopt a distance of 10  mpc for the derivation of physical parameters , and indicate the dependence of our results with distance explicitly by using the symbol d@xmath8 to denote distance in units of 10  mpc . we summarize the optical and near - infrared properties of ugc  7321 in table  1 .",
    "the scale height of the disk of ugc  7321 is one of the smallest ever reported for a galaxy disk ( matthews  2000 ) .",
    "ugc  7321 is also unique among the well - studied edge - on spirals because it has an extremely diffuse stellar disk with only minimal patchy dust obscuration and very low internal absorption .",
    "correspondingly , ugc  7321 has very low far - infrared and co luminosities ( matthews & gao  2001 ) .",
    "ugc  7321 is a very -rich galaxy with a high @xmath6  ratio .",
    "indeed , haynes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) obtained a carefully calibrated ( 5% )  spectrum of ugc  7321 with the green bank 43  m telescope , which yielded an integrated  line flux density of 44.51  jy  km  s@xmath26 .",
    "matthews et al .",
    "( 1999 ) made a 7-pointing map with the nanay  decimetric radio telescope and showed that the  gas extends beyond 1.2  times the optical radius .",
    "we compare these single - dish observations with our new vla  measurements in more detail in section  [ global ] .",
    "it has also been included in the recent study of warps in edge - on galaxies of garca - ruiz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who used observations made for the whisp survey .",
    "we observed ugc  7321 with the very large array ( vla ) in c configuration during 2000 may 26 ( hereafter day  1 ) and 2000 may 30 ( day  2 ) . since early 1998 ,",
    "the c  configuration is a modified version of the original c  configuration ( 3  km maximum baseline ) in which the fifth antenna of the north arm is placed at the center of the array thus improving its sensitivity to extended emission .",
    "indeed , it allowed us to `` recover '' ( nearly ) all of the `` single - dish ''  signal from ugc  7321 ( see section[global ] ) .",
    "the observations were obtained during two 8-hour ( late - afternoon to mostly nighttime ) observing sessions .    to obtain the best possible velocity resolution over the frequency range of interest ( defined from the single - dish  observations ) , we observed the field centered at the optical position of the galaxy with spectral mode  ` 4 ' using two pairs of 127  channels with on - line hanning smoothing ; this produced two pairs of 63  nearly - independent , contiguous channels of width 24.4  khz ( @xmath105.2  ) . for both observing sessions ,",
    "the first `` if pair '' ( consisting of separate right and left circular polarizations ) was tuned to the known heliocentric velocity of ugc  7321 ( 407  ) , while the second `` if pair '' was tuned to a central velocity of 650  ( on day  1 ) , and 300  ( on day  2 ) in order to search for possible dwarf companions or high - velocity gas in the neighborhood of ugc  7321 ( see section  [ companions ] ) .",
    "observations of the point source 1221 + 282 ( 5  minute `` scans '' each ) were interspersed with observations of ugc  7321 ( 30  minute scans ) . the strong source 1331 + 305 ( 3c286 )",
    "was observed twice each day ( 10  minute scans ) in order to obtain good flux calibration .",
    "most of the data on ugc  7321 ( 720  minutes ) were obtained at elevations above 40@xmath27 .",
    "details appear in table  2 .",
    "because our chosen phase - calibrator ( 1221 + 282 ) turned out to be considerably weaker ( 0.86  jy ) than the value given in the vla calibrator list ( 1.8  jy ) we used a non - conventional path for the data reduction .",
    "we generated a pseudo - continuum database by vector - averaging the data for channels  4 through  60 at each time stamp , but only used this file to find and edit corrupted data ( mostly due to interference and cross - talk at small spacings as well as a few malfunctioning correlators ) .",
    "we determined the overall shape of the bandpass as well as the zeroth - order amplitude and phase calibration in one operation using the strong primary calibrator 1331 + 305 ( 3c286 , which was observed at an elevation intermediate to those corresponding to the observations of ugc  7321 ) .",
    "we adopted a flux of 14.7363  jy at a frequency of 1418.36  mhz , appropriately scaled to the other two frequency settings , as indicated in the vla calibration manual .",
    "this bandpass calibration was applied to all data , which provided the amplitude scale of each frequency channel as well as an initial calibration of the instrumental phases .",
    "as is well known , phase errors increase at the band - edges and prevent an accurate calibration of the affected channels .",
    "we found that channels 13 and 6163 could not be calibrated to the accuracy of the 57  central channels .",
    "therefore , we have not used those six edge - channels in the analysis that follows .",
    "next , we made a ( deconvolved ) continuum image of the phase - calibrator using the spectral data from channels  4 through  60 with each visibility gridded at the correct `` uv - cell . ''",
    "this image was used for a subsequent `` global '' amplitude and phase ( self ) calibration ( i.e. , one amplitude and phase correction per antenna per scan which was applied to all frequency channels ) in which we constrained the average of the amplitudes to remain constant ( a global re - scaling by the factor 0.996 ) and where the averaging time was that of a `` scan . '' these corrections were subsequently applied to the ugc  7321 visibilities after linear 2-point interpolation ( in time ) of amplitudes and phases .",
    "these steps completed the calibration of the observations of day  1 , as we obtained two sets of spectral images ( `` image cubes '' ) that were free of any noticeable artifacts .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of the strongest continuum source in the ugc  7321 field ( j1217 + 2239 , with an observed flux density of 64.5  mjy ) , located at an angular distance of @xmath28 , did not show any systematic effects and was well - fitted with a constant over both frequency settings .    on the second day , the vla was not quite as stable as on the first day and we found it necessary to improve on the calibration of the instrumental antenna - based passbands .",
    "we followed the operations described above with a secondary calibration of the passband determined with the data obtained on j1221 + 282 ( the phase calibrator ) . because of the low flux density of this calibrator ( 0.86  jy ) and the confusion in the surrounding area ( @xmath100.3  jy ) we could only afford to determine one ( complex ) correction per antenna and per channel for the whole observing run , which was obtained by comparing the visibilities channel - by - channel with the theoretical values obtained from the continuum image of j1221 + 282 obtained as described above .",
    "these corrections were subsequently applied to the ugc7321 data and new image cubes were made .",
    "this step was sufficient for the second frequency setting used on this day , but not so for the first frequency setting , as the spectrum through the aforementioned continuum source , j1217 + 2239 , showed significant curvature .",
    "therefore , we were forced to evaluate scan - based corrections to the spectral passband for the main frequency - setting on this day using the observations of j1221 + 282 ( the phase calibrator ) .",
    "however , given the low signal - to - noise ratio per channel of these observations , we could only determine ( scan based ) global corrections to the passband in the form of 5-th order chebyshev polynomials using channels  4 through  60 by comparing the so - corrected data to the theoretical visibility function derived from the continuum image of the j1221 + 282 field determined in the previous step .",
    "these corrections were once again applied to the ugc7321 data using linear - interpolation between pairs of observations of 1221 + 282 .",
    "the image cube determined after this calibration was free of defects , and the source j1217 + 2239 discussed above was well fit with a constant .",
    "we have performed a number of tests on the continuum images of our amplitude and phase calibrators and estimate that the uncertainty in the amplitude scale of the images that we present in this paper is about 1% .",
    "we used the line - free channels in the second frequency setting ( hereafter if2 ) of each observation to compute an image of the continuum emission in the vicinity of ugc7321 . because there were 47  such channels on day  1 and only 23  on day  2 , we proceeded in the following manner .",
    "we first made a multi - field ( 20 fields ) image with the data from channels 450 from day  1 using channel - based `` 3-d '' gridding and a robustness factor @xmath29 , which offers an optimal compromise between noise and resolution when imaging vla observations obtained with full uv - coverage ( briggs 1995 ) .",
    "this yielded a continuum image computed over an effective bandwidth of @xmath101.15  mhz .",
    "these images were used to generate phase corrections through self - calibration of the data with a 5  minute averaging interval .",
    "next we subtracted the theoretical visibilities derived from the images on a channel - by - channel basis and subsequently determined the frequency - averaged residual visibilities .",
    "the increased sensitivity of these pseudo - continuum visibilities allowed us to recognize some residual low - level contamination which was mostly due to solar interference ( in the data obtained in the late - afternoon ) as well as cross - talk on short spacings .",
    "these data were discarded ( about 11% of the visibilities ) prior to restoring the ( theoretical ) contribution of the radio sources determined above .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the line - free channels ( 3860 ) in if2 of day  2 , except that here a 10  minute averaging time was used for the phase - only self - calibration because of the reduced effective bandwidth ( @xmath30  mhz ) .",
    "again , about 10% of the visibilities were found to show low - level contamination and discarded .",
    "the resulting pseudo - continuum visibilities were combined and a new set of final images ( 20  fields ) was made using a @xmath31 cell - size .",
    "the images have a nearly circular synthesized - beam with @xmath32 and an rms noise level of @xmath33jy / beam ( essentially the theoretical noise level ) , and are devoid of any noticeable artifacts .",
    "the total deconvolved flux is 199  mjy .",
    "it is customary to remove the continuum emission from the visibilities prior to imaging the line emission in the individual channels .",
    "this is often accomplished with a visibility - based subtraction of the continuum in which a first - order polynomial is fit to the real and imaginary components of each visibility , and the residuals are used to make the channel images ( cornwell , uson , & haddad  1992 ) . in our case , there are only four line - free channels at each end of if1 ( channels 47 and 5760 ) and the limited number of degrees of freedom in the visibility - based subtraction of the continuum results in an artificial lowering of the noise in the images corresponding to those channels ( to @xmath1075% of the theoretical level ) .",
    "therefore , we have followed an alternate path to compute the channel images , whereby we have made images of the total ( line plus continuum ) emission in each channel and subsequently determined the line emission as discussed below .",
    "we made twelve image cubes using the combined data from both of our observing dates for if1 .",
    "only the first image cube ( which is centered on ugc  7321 ) contained  emission ; the remaining eleven image cubes were centered on neighboring continuum sources in order to image the total continuum flux in the field properly .",
    "we used a @xmath34-cellsize and a robustness factor @xmath35 in order to minimize the noise level while still yielding a reasonable synthesized - beam which was nearly circular with @xmath36 at position angle pa@xmath37 .",
    "the deconvolution was deep , to 0.35  mjy  beam@xmath26 ( @xmath38 ) and was followed by a restoration of spurious ( isolated ) components if the absolute value of the flux inside a six - pixel radius was below 0.7  mjy   beam@xmath26 .",
    "the peak deconvolved flux ( line plus continuum , uncorrected for primary - beam attenuation ) was 480  mjy at 1417.922  mhz .",
    "the rms noise was 0.350.40  mjy  beam@xmath26 .",
    "this procedure resulted in images that were free of artifacts and did not show a negative bowl surrounding the  emission .",
    "we made the corresponding sets of twelve image cubes with the data from if2 for each one of the two observing dates .",
    "because the noise level was 40% higher than for the combined data from if1 , we stopped the deconvolution and `` filtered '' the spurious components at correspondingly scaled levels .",
    "next we combined the three image cubes corresponding to the central field at the three observed frequency settings into a global cube with 125  channels in the following way : channels  1 through  47 correspond to channels  4 through  50 of if2 from day  1 . because the if settings used on day  1 resulted in overlapping channels that were reasonably aligned ( a misalignment of only @xmath104% ) channels  48 through  57 are a weighted average of the images in channels  51 through  60 of if2 ( day  1 ) and channels  4 through  13 of if1 ( both days ) respectively .",
    "most of the weight is attached to the second image in each pair ( created from the combined data from both days ) .",
    "this might seem unnecessary and even undesirable , as corresponding channels observed through both ifs ( on day  1 ) view the same sky - photons , but the vla backend introduces some noise into the observation which can be reduced somewhat through this average .",
    "care was taken that the weights accurately reflected the loss of independence of the images averaged",
    ". channels  58 through  101 of the global cube were channels  14 through  57 of if1 ( obtained from the combined observations of both days ) ; while channels  102 through  104 resulted from the weighted average of channels  58 through  60 of if1 and  37 through  39 of if2 , day  2 , respectively , with weights determined as above . because the frequency alignment of the channels was somewhat poorer on day  2 ( a misalignment of @xmath1025% ) here",
    "we have only combined line - free channels , so that the small blurring ( in frequency ) is of no consequence . finally ,",
    "channels  105 through  125 of the global cube correspond to channels  40 through  60 of if2 of day  2 .",
    "we have performed a number of tests on this combined image cube .",
    "figure  [ fig : contspectrum ] shows the spectrum at the position of the continuum source j1217 + 2239 in the combined , global 125-channel cube .",
    "it is well fit by a constant @xmath39  mjy with a chi - square of 123.9 with 124 degrees of freedom .",
    "this is an indication that the bandpass correction has been successful in flattening the spectrum and that the amplitude and phase calibrations on the four different if - day combinations are consistent to within the noise level reached .",
    "it also shows that the deconvolution has been successful in eliminating the bowl around the emission that is quite apparent in the raw images and that any residual deconvolution bias is fairly consistent from channel to channel .",
    "we have examined the statistics of the image cube to check for artifacts .",
    "the cube is remarkably clean .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : imeannoise ] shows a histogram of the values in planes 48104 which correspond to if1 but with the region of  emission from ugc  7321 excluded ( the central @xmath40 for planes 52100 ) .",
    "the histogram is as expected from a statistical distribution with the corresponding number of degrees of freedom ( values are correlated within any synthesized - beam area ) .",
    "even more remarkable is the comparison with the histogram in figure  [ fig : imeansignal ] , which shows the distribution of values in the central @xmath40 for planes 52100 that had been excluded from figure  [ fig : imeannoise ] .",
    "the signal is clearly noticeable , but it is also clear that the negative values show the distribution that is expected in the absence of any deconvolution artifacts , such as bowls .",
    "we have determined the continuum emission from this cube in the image - plane by linear fitting of a first - order polynomial to each line - of - sight ( pixel ) in the cube ( cornwell et al .",
    "1992 ) after blanking the region that contains the  emission from ugc  7321 . because of the finite spacial distribution of the  emission",
    ", this procedure results in a larger number of `` line - free '' channels per line - of - sight than if the subtraction is performed in the visibility domain and the procedure does not alter the noise characteristics of the channel images in a detectable way .",
    "this continuum - subtracted cube has been used for the analysis of the  emission reported in this paper .",
    "finally , we have made a similar 125-channel image cube following the procedure just described but with a robustness parameter @xmath41 .",
    "this is closer to uniform weigthing and results in a somewhat sharper synthesized beam that is again nearly circular ( fwhm@xmath42 at pa  @xmath43 , with a @xmath34 cellsize ) .",
    "the weighting results in noise levels that are about 40% larger that the corresponding ones for the @xmath35 cube and the deconvolution limits and filtering levels were correspondingly scaled .",
    "the region around ugc  7321 contains only relatively weak radio continuum sources ( figure  [ fig : continuum ] ) . the brightest source within the primary beam , j1217 + 2239 ,",
    "is located @xmath44 to the nw of ugc  7321 and has an integrated flux of @xmath45  mjy ( after correcting for the attenuation due to the primary beam ) , in good agreement with the value @xmath46  mjy listed in the nrao vla sky survey ( hereafter nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : continuum ] that we have failed to detect continuum emission from ugc  7321 itself .",
    "the peak value within the ( optical ) disk of the galaxy is only @xmath47  mjy  beam@xmath26 ( formal error ) at 12@xmath48 17@xmath49 33.8@xmath50 + @xmath51(j2000 ) .",
    "however , because of the uncertainty introduced by the deconvolution of the sidelobes from j1217 + 2239 , the actual uncertainty at this position is somewhat larger .",
    "ugc  7321 was only weakly detected in the fir by _ iras _ in the 60@xmath52 m and 100@xmath52 m bands . upon examining the _ iras _",
    "60@xmath52 m and 100@xmath52 m survey scans from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive , we found ugc  7321 to be consistent with a point source in the fir with fwhm@xmath53 .",
    "iras _ faint - source catalog indicates flux densities of 0.344  jy at 60@xmath52 m ( @xmath54 ) and 0.964  jy at 100@xmath52 m ( @xmath55 ) which yields a fir flux of @xmath56  w m@xmath57 ( using eq .  14 in condon 1992 ) and a predicted 1.4  ghz continuum flux density of @xmath103.1  mjy ( eq .  15 in condon 1992 ) . to place a meaningful limit on the radio continuum emission from ugc  7321 , we have summed the flux in our continuum image ( section  [ imagcont ] ) within a @xmath58 box centered at the coordinates quoted above , which yields a flux density of @xmath59  mjy given the low significance of the _ iras _ detections , it is perhaps not surprising that the galaxy is not detected in the radio continuum .",
    "in addition , some of the fir luminosity could be due to a contribution from cirrus emission as well as from a weak embedded nucleus .",
    "indeed , matthews et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found a rather red ( @xmath601.5 ) , compact feature inside the _ iras _ box .",
    "moreover , a low - mass galaxy such as ugc  7321 might be unable to confine cosmic rays with sufficient efficiency and would thus fall short of the prediction from the fir - radio correlation .    using the relations given by condon  ( 1992 ) , the low fir emission from ugc  7321 yields a rather small estimate of its high - mass star formation rate of @xmath100.006/year ( for @xmath61 ) .",
    "such a rate is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the mean value estimated for all ugc galaxies of type scd - im ( see roberts & haynes 1994 ) , confirming that ugc  7321 is a bona fide low surface - brightness spiral galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : channelmaps ] shows the images corresponding to the channels that contain detectable  emission , flanked with one extra channel on each side , overlayed on an @xmath62-band image of ugc  7321 .",
    "a number of features of the  disk and velocity field of ugc  7321 can be seen in these channel images .",
    "for example , the channels covering the velocity ranges 293.4  319.2  and 479.4  510.4  , clearly show warping of the outer gas layers . in addition , in most of the channel images , the spread in @xmath63 of the emission increases with distance from the disk center , which indicates flaring of the gas layer .",
    "however , the gas in the most extreme velocity channels is confined to a narrower distribution than at small and intermediate velocities , contrary to the expectation for a pure flaring model ( see also swaters et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "it is interesting that in the two channels representing the velocity extrema of the observed  emission ( i.e. , corresponding to velocities of 283.0  and 531.1  ) , we see gas that is not located at the edge of the  disk , but rather at smaller galactocentric radii , near the edge of the stellar disk .",
    "this is indicative of a falling rotation curve in the outskirts of ugc  7321 ( see section  [ rotcurve ] below ) .        in order to estimate the total  content of ugc  7321 and derive a global  rotation profile , we measured the total  flux in each of the channel images from our global , @xmath35 , cube , after discarding low values ( those with absolute value @xmath64 ) and restricting the sum to the pixels corresponding to the galaxy .",
    "the corresponding pixels were determined from an initial selection consisting of those pixels which were above the @xmath65 level ( where the galaxy is quite distinct ) and expanding such areas by successive surrounding bands 3-pixels wide ( @xmath66 ) until the enclosed flux converged . for each channel , the selected areas were summed after correction for the attenuation of the primary - beam .",
    "we estimated the error in the total  flux in each channel from the rms noise in that channel , taking into account the correlation introduced by the synthesized - beam and the correction due to the attenuation of the primary beam .",
    "the resulting errors are quite small ( @xmath67  mjy per channel ) .",
    "the resulting global  profile is shown in figure  [ fig : global ] .",
    "also shown are the profiles obtained with the nrao 43  m  telescope ( haynes et al .",
    "1998 ) and with the  nanay  telescope ( matthews et al .",
    "the three  profiles match extremely well given the 5% calibration uncertainty ( and statistical correction for primary beam attenuation ) of the green bank data , and the estimated calibration uncertainty of the seven - pointing nanayspectrum .",
    "the total  flux derived from the present data is @xmath68  jy  km  s@xmath26 , where the error comes from a statistical contribution of 0.11  jy  km  s@xmath26 , an estimated systematic contribution of 0.36  jy  km  s@xmath26 and a global calibration uncertainty of @xmath69% .",
    "comparison with the values measured with the 43  m ( 44.51  jy km s@xmath26  ) and the nanay  ( 47.6@xmath70jy km s@xmath26  with 15% calibration uncertainty ) telescopes indicates that the measurements reported in this paper have likely recovered most of the  flux .",
    "the measured brightness temperatures peak at a value of t@xmath71  k at the center of the galaxy and at the systemic velocity .",
    "the somewhat better resolution image made using a robustness factor r@xmath72 ( fwhm@xmath73 ) yields a corresponding peak brightness temperature t@xmath74  k. this value is interestingly close to those measured in the milky way ( burton  1970 ) suggesting that the  spectrum of ugc  7321 might be affected by self - absorption .",
    "we have examined cuts along the major and minor axes of the emission at the systemic frequency ( which contains the peak values ) .",
    "the latter is well fit by a gaussian of half - width @xmath75 , with the data falling short of the gaussian fit at the center position by @xmath76% , indicating only mild self - absorption . neglecting this leads to an estimate of the total  mass of ugc  7321 of @xmath77  d@xmath5  .    from the global  profile ,",
    "we measure velocity widths at 20% and 50% of the peak maximum of 234.3 and 219.8  , respectively .",
    "the heliocentric recessional velocity ( optical definition ) determined as the average of the 20%-level values of the global  profile is 406.8  ( table  3 ) .",
    "these values are all in agreement with previous single - dish measurements .",
    "the sub - images containing  extracted as discussed in the previous section have been added to obtain the total  intensity map of ugc  7321 which is shown in figure  [ fig : totintmap ] , overplotted on a continuum - subtracted h@xmath78 $ ] image of the galaxy .",
    "the overall  morphology of ugc  7321 is typical of normal , edge - on spirals .",
    "it shows a relatively smooth , unperturbed , symmetric distribution , and we see no obvious enhancements in the  emission corresponding to the locations of the h@xmath78 $ ] emission . at a resolution of @xmath79 , the peak intensity observed within the galaxy corresponds to @xmath80 @xmath2 , while the maximum observed extent of the  disk along the major axis is @xmath12@xmath13 @xmath14 at @xmath81  @xmath2 , or roughly 1.5 times the ( d@xmath82 ) diameter of the stellar disk . at @xmath83 @xmath2 ,",
    "we measure an  diameter of @xmath84@xmath13@xmath85 .    the slight depression in the  intensity distribution visible near the optical center of ugc  7321 is possibly due to the mild self - absorption discussed above .",
    "such features are frequently seen in  images of edge - on spirals .",
    "in addition , small  filaments appear to be protruding vertically from the disk to higher latitudes .",
    "these features are discussed further in section  [ pvz ] .",
    "one particularly interesting feature of the total  intensity map of ugc  7321 is the `` integral sign '' warp visible in the  disk .",
    "the warp commences near the edge of the stellar disk , reaching a peak amplitude of @xmath86 on the east side of the disk and @xmath87 on the west ( i.e. , roughly 4% of the  disk radius ) , before the gas twists back toward the midplane in the outermost regions .",
    "these features can be seen clearly in the warp curve shown in figure  [ fig : warpcurve ] , where we have plotted the mean deviation of the  gas from the disk midplane as a function of radius , measured by fitting single gaussians to intensity profiles perpendicular to the disk .",
    "warps with features similar to those of ugc  7321 have now been observed in the  disk of the milky way ( burton  1988 ) and numerous edge - on spiral galaxies ( sancisi  1976 ; briggs  1990 ; garca - ruiz et al .",
    "gaseous warps usually originate at the edge of the stellar distribution , which is to be expected because it would seem easier to pull material out from the midplane in regions where the self - gravity is lowest , and because once material becomes displaced from the midplane , dissipational and dynamical - friction forces will cause it to settle back into equilibrium more quickly within the stellar disk than outside of it ( e.g. , bottema 1996 ) .",
    "however , the outer stellar disk of ugc  7321 is extraordinarily diffuse ( matthews et al .",
    "1999 ) , implying that its self - gravity should be far less significant than in the outer regions of a galaxy like the milky way .",
    "therefore , the commencement of the  warp near the edge of the stellar disk ( with essentially no hint of warping being visible in the stars ) seems somewhat surprising .",
    "a number of researchers have shown that warps are more commonly seen in galaxies that have companions ( e.g. , reshetnikov & combes  1998 ) , implying that interactions play a role in triggering them .",
    "however , ugc  7321 appears to be an unusually isolated galaxy , with no close companions detectable in the optical bands , and no gas - rich companions with @xmath88  ( see section  [ companions ] ) .",
    "the nearest optically catalogued neighbors to ugc  7321 are ugc  7236",
    "( type i m ) , at @xmath89=945  and a projected distance of @xmath90 ( 0.34  d@xmath8  mpc ) , and ngc  4204 ( type sbdm ) , at @xmath91861  and a projected distance of @xmath92 ( again 0.34  d@xmath8  mpc ) . assuming a typical group speed of 200  , the last encounter of ugc  7321 with one of its neighbors would have taken place at least @xmath93 years ago , even if they were separated only by their ( minimal ) projected distance .",
    "is it plausible that an encounter with one of these systems could have triggered the warp in ugc  7321 ?",
    "a consequence of tidal interactions will be to cause heating ( thickening ) of galaxy disks ( e.g. , reshetnikov & combes 1997 ) . although the stellar disk of ugc  7321 is ( dynamically ) much colder than those of typical spiral galaxies , matthews  ( 2000 )",
    "has shown that ugc  7321 does show distinct vertical color gradients and a multi - component stellar disk structure , consistent with a disk that has been mildly heated .    using statistical arguments ,",
    "reshetnikov & combes ( 1997 ) suggested that the typical `` cooling '' time for a disk mildly perturbed by an interaction should be @xmath1010@xmath94  years .",
    "hofner & sparke ( 1994 ) , who treat warps as discrete bending modes in a disk embedded in a dark halo potential , have developed a formalism to estimate the age of a warp . in ugc  7321",
    ", the rotation curve flattens at about @xmath95 from the center ( the hofner - sparke @xmath96 ) , the warp commences at about @xmath97 from the center of the disk , the peak rotational velocity ( @xmath98 ) is about 110  , the disk scale length ( @xmath99 ) is @xmath100  kpc and the disk mass ( in gas and stars ) is @xmath101 . in this latter relation ,",
    "the factor of 1.34 corrects the gas mass for the contribution of helium and @xmath102 is the stellar mass - to - light - ratio .",
    "we assume that the contributions of molecular and ionized gas are negligible .",
    "using the models of bell & de jong ( 2001 ) , we adopt a stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath102=1.0 based on ugc  7321 s @xmath103 color of 0.97 .",
    "then , equation  7 of hofner & sparke ( 1994 ) leads to an estimate of the age of the warp of @xmath1010@xmath104 years .",
    "thus , our estimate does not exclude the possibility that a mild encounter between ugc  7321 and one of its nearest catalogued dwarf neighbors could have occurred @xmath105  years ago and triggered its warp ( as well as some mild dynamical heating of its disk ) .",
    "assuming that the timescale for the cooling of the disk is @xmath1010@xmath94  years as suggested by reshetnikov & combes  ( 1997 ) , such a scenario would have allowed sufficient time for subsequent star formation ( and possible gas accretion ) to re - establish the very thin young stellar disk that is observed in ugc7321 .    ultimately , self - consistent numerically calculations ( including the gas and the stars , as well as a `` live '' dark matter halo ) will be needed in order to gauge whether the amplitude and line of nodes of the warp of ugc  7321 are consistent with its triggering by the passage of one of its dwarf neighbors , and whether a thin , moderate - mass disk like ugc  7321 could have survived such an encounter relatively unscathed .",
    "we have computed a map of the first moment of the  emission ( representing the  velocity field ) of ugc  7321 from our @xmath35 spectral image cube using the standard `` cutoff '' technique ( rots & shane 1975 ) .",
    "a 2@xmath106 clipping was applied to the absolute values in the image cube after spatially smoothing the data with a gaussian kernel of @xmath107 and hanning - smoothing the data in velocity . in order to maintain a uniform cutoff with respect to the noise",
    ", these operations were performed on images uncorrected for primary beam attenuation .",
    "the spatial and velocity smoothing were used for the purpose of deciding which pixels to discard ; the moment map was made with the full resolution of the input cube .",
    "because of the biases that clipping of any sort can introduce ( bosma  1981 ) , we used the moment-1 map ( shown in figure  [ fig : mom1 ] ) only to obtain a qualitative impression of the global  velocity field of ugc  7321 .",
    "overall , the velocity field of ugc  7321 is fairly smooth and normal , although some minor irregularities are visible . in the innermost regions , the isovelocity contours exhibit the characteristic `` v ''  shape of a differentially rotating disk , with only a slight asymmetry in the shape of these contours near the eastern and western ends of the disk .",
    "the symmetry of these contours about the midplane shows that the ( kinematic ) major axis of ugc  7321 does not appear to undergo any significant twisting or precession .",
    "although the velocity field of ugc  7321 is fairly regular , a mild asymmetry between the receeding and the approaching sides is noticeable about half - way through the extent of the optical disk .",
    "in addition , at galactocentric radii @xmath10875@xmath0 , the isovelocity contours begin to exhibit some curvature at the edges that can be attributed to the warping of the disk . finally , at the far edges of the disk",
    ", we see the most pronounced deviations from purely regular rotation . on the approaching side ,",
    "the isovelocity contours exhibit their greatest distortion as the terminal velocity of the disk is neared , while the receding side of the disk shows three irregular patches of higher velocity material superimposed on the constant - velocity outer disk region .        in figure",
    "[ fig : pv ] we show position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams for ugc  7321 along the major axis of the disk ( center panel ) , as well as at heights of @xmath109 , above and below the midplane .",
    "these diagrams were made from unsmoothed data with no averaging applied along the vertical direction .",
    "the overall shape of the p - v diagrams of ugc  7321 is that of a `` scaled - down '' giant spiral ( e.g. , m31 ; brinks & shane 1984 ) ; although it shows a smaller fraction of its emission near the terminal velocity ( along the `` flat '' part of the p - v diagram ) than in most giant spirals , and the peak rotational velocity of ugc  7321 is only about half of that of a system like m31 .",
    "a large range of gas velocities is observed at all positions across the disk , particularly in the central regions . while similar features are commonly seen in the p - v diagrams of more luminous spirals , many low - mass spiral galaxies with luminosities and rotational velocities similar to those of ugc  7321 exhibit slowly rising , solid - body rotation curves with a much narrower spread of velocities at any given radius [ e.g. , ic  2233 ( matthews & uson  2002 ) ; ngc  55 ( puche , carignan , & wainscoat  1991 ) ; ngc  4395 ( swaters et al .",
    "1999 ) ] .",
    "one interesting feature of the major axis p - v profile of ugc  7321 is its `` figure-8 '' shape , which is clearly visible in figure  [ fig : pv ] .",
    "m31 exhibits a similar signature in its major axis p - v  curve , and brinks & shane  ( 1984 ) demonstrated that this results from the warping and flaring of its  disk . as discussed above",
    ", the  disk of ugc  7321 is also warped , and the twisting of its gas disk is likely to be the origin of the `` figure-8 '' shape seen in this galaxy .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : mom1 ] , where the isovelocity contours are found to be predominantly v - shaped in the inner disk regions , but at @xmath110 they begin to twist near the edges .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the central panel of figure  [ fig : pv ] suggests the presence of a ( small ) bar or inner arm that extends from about @xmath111 to @xmath112 and manifests itself mainly in the decrease of the intensity at @xmath113 , @xmath114  ) . indeed , in a barred galaxy",
    "viewed edge - on , the lack of available orbits for gas near the corotation radius manifests itself as a perturbation in the major - axis p - v diagram ( kuijken & merrifield 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the optical h - band major - axis profile shows two distinct `` shoulders '' at @xmath115 where the light exceeds that of a pure exponential disk ( matthews et al .  1999 , their figure  3 ) .",
    "given its edge - on orientation it might be difficult to distinguish between a small bar and an inner arm or even confirm their reality .",
    "however , should further observations confirm that ugc  7321 is in fact barred , they would challenge the conventional view that bar formation is strongly suppressed in galaxies with low surface densities and large dark matter contents ( mihos et al .",
    "1997 ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : zpv ] we display p - v diagrams extracted at five different cuts parallel to the rotational axis of ugc  7321 : along the minor axis ( @xmath116 ) , at @xmath117 , and at @xmath118 . in all of these p - v  profiles ,",
    "we identify features at @xmath119 levels that appear to be filaments extending out of the plane of ugc  7321 to distances up to @xmath120 ( @xmath102.9  d@xmath8  kpc ) .",
    "in addition to these features , other apparent asymmetries are visible in the minor axis p - v profiles when the two sides of the disk are compared .",
    "these trends are reminiscent of features reported in the giant , edge - on sbc galaxy ngc  891 by swaters et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which they attributed to the presence of an  halo produced by a galactic fountain .",
    "as discussed by these authors , detailed modelling is required in order to demonstrate conclusively that the apparent high - latitude extensions are not simply manifestations of a warp or of flaring of the gas disk .",
    "an analysis of the high - latitude gas will be reported elsewhere ( matthews and wood  2002 ) .",
    "commonly used methods of converting p - v data into a true disk rotation curve , such as fitting tilted ring models to the velocity field , extracting major axis cuts along the velocity field , or fitting single , intensity - weighted gaussians to one - dimensional p - v slices , break down for edge - on and nearly edge - on galaxies as a consequence of projection effects . indeed ,",
    "if applied to highly inclined galaxies , these methods will result in a rotation curve which is artificially shallow in the inner regions ( sancisi & allen 1979 ) .",
    "therefore , we have used a technique that was first introduced to galactic rotation studies by shane & bieger - smith  ( 1966 ) which involves the determination of the terminal velocity at a given position , @xmath121 , from one - dimensional p - v cuts at various radii using an `` equivalent rectangular measure '' based on the location of the extreme velocity features :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 is the peak flux density in the profile , @xmath124 is its corresponding velocity , @xmath125 is the channel separation , and @xmath126 is the velocity at which the wing of the extreme velocity edge of the line profile drops to zero .",
    "the last term in the equation is a correction that accounts for gas turbulence and was introduced by burton & gordon  ( 1978 ) who also noted that this method is rather insensitive to noise .",
    "we make the further approximation that @xmath106 is everywhere equal to 7  the average of the range of @xmath127(5  9 )  observed in normal spiral and quiescent dwarf galaxies ( van der kruit & shostak  1984 ; lo et al .",
    "1993 ; olling  1996 ) and which we also find to be consistent with our data based on gaussian fits to the extreme velocity envelopes of our one - dimensional p - v cuts .",
    "we have ignored any additional corrections for asymmetric drift in ugc  7321 , as such corrections for the gaseous components of disks are typically on the order of only a few i.e .",
    "small compared with the uncertainties of applying such corrections ( de  blok & bosma  2002 ) .",
    "the resulting rotation curve is shown in figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] .",
    "we have indicated on this figure the location of the edges of the stellar disk .",
    "the statistical errors of these measurements have a median value of 0.7  , with only two points at the end of the receding side and three points at the end of the approaching side having significantly larger statistical errors of up to 6  .",
    "however , the uncertainties are likely to be dominated by systematic errors .",
    "we have compared the values that we derived using the `` equivalent rectangular measure '' to those obtained from fitting `` half - gaussian '' functions to the outer part of the profiles in the flat region of the rotation curve and estimate systematic errors of order @xmath67  .",
    "we see that the rotation curve of ugc  7321 flattens on both sides of the disk , reaching a peak rotational velocity of @xmath10110  , but that it rises rather slowly , not reaching @xmath128 until about half - way through the disk .",
    "this is in contrast to high surface brightness spirals , whose rotation curves tend to rise rapidly to their asymptotic value , ( e.g. , casertano & van  gorkom  1991 ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] that the rotation curve of ugc  7321 does not exhibit any strong asymmetries or lopsidedness , particularly in the inner regions .",
    "it does however show a slight ( @xmath1010% ) difference between the peak amplitudes of the approaching and receding sides of the disk , and the rotation curve is observed to extend about 1  kpc further on the approaching side ( see also figure  [ fig : pv ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] shows that near the edge of its  disk , the rotation of ugc  7321 appears to decline , decreasing by @xmath109% from its peak value .",
    "evidence for this decline can also be seen in the major axis p - v plot in figure  [ fig : pv ] and the channel maps in figure  [ fig : channelmaps ] .",
    "a declining rotation curve was also reported for the thin , edge - on spiral ngc  4244 by olling ( 1996 ) .",
    "two possible interpretations of this falling rotation curve in ugc  7321 are that either the dark matter halo of ugc  7321 is truncated near the edge of the disk , or that we are seeing a projection effect caused by the warping of ugc  7321",
    ". both interpretations are consistent with the data .",
    "whenever a slowly rising rotation curve is inferred from  aperture synthesis measurements , it is of some concern whether the apparent slow rise could be an artifact of beam smearing ( begeman  1989 ) .",
    "indeed , some of the slowly rising rotation curves reported for lsb galaxies in the literature have been attributed to this effect ( swaters , madore , & trewhella  2000 ; van  den  bosch et al .",
    "these rotation curves can not be used to constrain the shape of dark matter halos , since the inner region is the most critical for distinguishing between the cuspy halos predicted by cold dark matter ( cdm ) models and dark matter halo models with lower density cores .    in order to gauge the possible effects of beam smearing in the rotation curve of ugc  7321 ,",
    "we have performed two tests .",
    "firstly , we produced a new deconvolved image cube of ugc  7321 using a robustness value of @xmath129 as described in section  [ imagline ] , which yielded a spatial resolution of @xmath130 , 25% narrower than that of our initial ( @xmath35 ) derivation .",
    "the rotation curve obtained following the steps described above is shown as a dotted line on figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] . aside from the uncertainties caused by the @xmath131% higher noise level in the higher resolution data , the agreement between the two rotation curves is excellent .",
    "a second check is provided by the comparison of the  rotation curve of ugc  7321 with the rotation curve derived by goad & roberts  ( 1981 ) from optical ( h@xmath132 ) emission line spectroscopy ( shown with ` + ' signs on figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] ) .",
    "the optical data have much higher spatial resolution than the  data and hence do not suffer from beam smearing . given the uncertainties introduced by the more irregular distribution of the  regions compared with that of the  gas , the agreement between the  and h@xmath132 rotation curves is quite good , even in the innermost regions .",
    "indeed , maximum deviations are @xmath205  ( our spectral resolution ) .",
    "as shown by matthews & wood  ( 2001 ) , the effects of internal extinction on the optical rotation curve should be negligible in ugc  7321 .",
    "we conclude that the effects of beam smearing are insignificant in our derived  rotation curve of ugc  7321 .      assuming a spherical mass model for ugc  7321",
    ", the dynamical mass of ugc  7321 within radius @xmath133 is simply @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the mass contained within the radius of the last measured point of the rotation curve ( taken to correspond to @xmath135  d@xmath8  kpc , @xmath136  ) , is @xmath137  d@xmath8 .",
    "this implies ratios of the total mass to the galaxy s @xmath25-band luminosity and  mass , respectively , of @xmath138 d@xmath139 and @xmath140  d@xmath139 .",
    "these ratios are 78 times larger and 3  times larger , respectively , than the median values found by roberts & haynes  ( 1994 ) for scd  sd galaxies , indicating a large dark matter content in ugc  7321 . assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio in the range @xmath141  1.4 , consistent with the @xmath142 color of ugc  7321 , and a correction to the  mass of 1.34 for the contribution of helium , the ratio of the dynamical mass to the visible mass in ugc  7321 is in the range ( 1113 ) d@xmath139 , which is again rather large .",
    "we have begun detailed modelling of the underlying distribution of dark matter in ugc  7321 .",
    "preliminary results indicate a slight preference for a pseudo - isothermal sphere over the cuspy distributions suggested by cdm numerical simulations ( navarro , frenk , & white  1996 ) . in all cases ,",
    "ugc  7321 is highly dark - matter dominated at all radii beyond @xmath143  d@xmath8  kpc .",
    "because of the high inclination of ugc  7321 , the column densities inferred directly from the total - intensity map ( figure  [ fig : totintmap ] ) represent only projected values rather than the true gas surface densities in the disk .",
    "deprojected gas surface densities are of interest for assessing the star - formation efficiency of ugc  7321 and for comparing its  distribution to that of other less inclined late - type and lsb spirals .    in order to estimate the deprojected  surface density in ugc  7321 as a function of radius",
    ", we have followed an iterative modelling procedure using the formalism developed by irwin and her collaborators ( the cubit software , irwin & seaquist 1991 ; irwin 1994 ) .",
    "this is a non - linear least - squares fitting program that operates on a three - dimensional ( ) spectral - line image cube and is capable of simultaneously determining the underlying density distribution and velocity field .",
    "we adopted the observed rotation curve for ugc  7321 ( see section  [ rotcurve ] ) and used it to determine the density distribution .    from the fits , we found that we were unable to reproduce the  density distribution of ugc  7321 with a single - component disk model either gaussian or exponential in @xmath133 and @xmath63 . neglecting the warping and flaring of the gas , we were able to find a reasonable fit to the data using a two - component model : ( 1 ) a ring of gaussian cross - section with a central hole of radius @xmath144 , a scale - height ( @xmath106 ) of @xmath145 , a scale - length of @xmath146 , and peak density of 0.19 atoms @xmath147 ; ( 2 ) a gaussian with scale - height of @xmath148 , a scale - length of @xmath149 , and a central density of 0.06 atoms @xmath147 . fixing these parameters",
    ", we used cubit to compute a face - on rendition of the galaxy and `` observed '' the intensity distribution along its major axis .",
    "subsequently , we used this model profile in order to scale the observed major axis intensity profile of ugc  7321 to a deprojected ( face - on ) value which is shown in figure  [ fig : majorint ] .",
    "this profile is in good agreement with the one derived for ugc  7321 by garca - ruiz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from westerbork data using an abel inversion technique .",
    "figure  [ fig : majorint ] shows that the peak  surface density in ugc  7321 is only @xmath10  5.8  pc@xmath57 , somewhat smaller than the mean value of 10  pc@xmath57 found in normal surface brightness sd galaxies by cayatte et al .  ( 1994 ) or broeils & van  woerden  ( 1994 ) . moreover , it appears that at all radii , the gas surface density in ugc  7321 lies below that required for efficient star formation based on the dynamical criterion of kennicutt  ( 1989 ) .",
    "while this star formation criterion should only be considered an approximation ( ugc  7321 is clearly forming some stars ) , this result is nonetheless consistent with the very low star formation rate implied by its low ( optical ) surface brightness disk , weak co emission , and low radio continuum and far - infrared fluxes .",
    "although the gas surface densities observed in ugc  7321 are very low compared with those of normal spirals , they are however rather similar to the typical ( subcritical ) surface densities seen in other late - type , lsb spiral galaxies ( van der hulst et al .",

    "visual inspection of the image cube shows no recognizable companions .",
    "in addition , we have done a `` matched - filter '' automated search using a set of gaussian functions in frequency as our kernel ( uson , bagri , & cornwell  1991 ) . for @xmath157 in the range ( 24.4244 )",
    "khz ( 110  channels ) we search for an expected signal of the form :    @xmath158     where the kernel has the form    @xmath159,\\ ] ]     where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the edges of the observed band , and the norm @xmath162 is    @xmath163    the noise is weighted by the same kernel and is approximately equal to    @xmath164     which is the value that corresponds to the case in which all image planes have similar noise .",
    "the method is surprisingly efficient at finding signals even if their intrinsic shape is not gaussian .",
    "indeed , it is a good discriminant of faint extensions to the disk of ugc  7321 as they fade into the noise .",
    "when we exclude the galaxy delineated as discussed in section  [ global ] , a search done with a kernel of width equal to one channel yields a set of amplitudes , @xmath165 , which are nearly gaussian distributed , with tails extending up to @xmath166 .",
    "this is reasonably close to what is expected from statistics only as the image cube has @xmath167  degrees of freedom ( so that tails up to @xmath168 are expected if the noise is gaussian distributed ) .",
    "in addition , spurious `` absorption '' at the @xmath169 level is found against the source j1217 + 2239 discussed in section  [ cont ] .",
    "we have traced this systematic to small positional offsets between the three image cubes ( corresponding to the three observational settings ) that we have combined to generate the 125  channel image cube .",
    "these offsets are a consequence of residual phase noise left behind in the calibration .",
    "because companions are likely to show  emission with width of up to @xmath1040  , we have repeated our search with kernels of width 210  channels . even though the smoothing introduced by",
    "the kernel decreases the number of degrees of freedom , the algorithm `` finds '' somewhat more extended distributions with tails that reach @xmath170 , especially when using kernels with a width of a few ( 37 ) channels ( in addition , the line of sight to j1217 + 2239 again shows spurious signals due to the image jitter just described ) .",
    "this is likely due to a lack of independence between neighboring channels in excess of the @xmath104% expected from hanning - smoothing , which could be introduced by low - level errors in the vla backend electronics , as well as by errors in the correction of the spectral bandpass during the data reduction due to insufficient sensitivity ( see also section  [ imagline ] ) .",
    "we have verified that these tails have not been introduced because of our decision to image the line emission without prior subtraction of the continuum emission ( section  [ imagline ] ) by reprocessing the data after performing the customary visibility - based subtraction of the continuum emission ( cornwell et al .",
    "the resulting spectral images agree with the ones described above within the noise ; although they have a higher `` zero - point '' uncertainty due to the small number of line - free channels in if1 .",
    "in addition , the rms noise is not uniform , being significantly lower for the four line - free channels at each end that are used to define the continuum .",
    "in addition , the matched filter finds a `` signal '' at a level of @xmath10@xmath171  @xmath172  mjy ) ; which appears in a single synthesized - beam area with a width of about six channels .",
    "we are unable to provide any corroborating evidence that would lead us to believe that this small blip represents real  emission . moreover , given that the tail of negative values of @xmath165 reaches down to @xmath10@xmath173 for this kernel , we prefer to treat it at this time as spurious excess noise .",
    "we have added three standard deviations to its fiducial value and corrected it for the attenuation of the primary beam of the vla antennas in order to derive a robust upper - limit to the  mass of the fiducial companions to ugc  7321 located within a radius of 12  minutes of arc ( 36  d@xmath8  kpc ) of  @xmath174  d@xmath5  .",
    "therefore , we find no close  companion that might be responsible for the warp of ugc  7321 ( section  [ warp ] ) . even allowing for a significant dark matter component in any such companions to ugc  7321 , their total masses would still be below 1% of the inferred total mass of ugc  7321 ( section  [ dynmass ] ) .",
    "such a mass is likely to be too small to excite a warp via tidal forcing ( hunter & toomre 1969 ; kuijken & garca - ruiz  2001 ) , thus requiring either the warp of ugc  7321 to be quite old ( in order to have allowed the perturber sufficient time move outside our search region ) , or that the warp was excited by some other mechanism .",
    "we have presented high - sensitivity  images of the isolated , edge - on , ` superthin ' spiral galaxy ugc  7321 with a resolution of 24.4  khz and a total bandwidth of 3.052  mhz ( 125  channels ) . in the optical , ugc  7321",
    "exhibits a diffuse stellar disk with little dust obscuration , an extremely small global scale height , and no discernible spheroid component .",
    "these features indicate that ugc  7321 is a late - type , lsb spiral seen at high inclination .",
    "ugc  7321 thus allows us to explore both the radial and vertical structure of the ism of an ordinary lsb galaxy whose disk has not been recently perturbed .",
    "ugc  7321 shows similar global  characteristics to other late - type , lsb spirals : it has a gas - rich disk with = @xmath77  d@xmath175  , and an inferred ratio of @xmath6  =  1.0(in solar units ) , which is at the high end of the observed values for spiral galaxies . assuming a stellar mass - to - light ratio similar to the sun ( based on its global @xmath103 color ) ugc  7321 contains a similar fraction of its visible mass in gas as in stars , suggesting that it has been a relatively inefficent star former .",
    "ugc  7321 is undetected in the 21-cm radio continuum ( @xmath9mjy ) , which is consistent with its status as a low star formation rate system . assuming a spherical mass distribution , the ratio of the dynamical mass to the total visible mass ( total gas+stars ) is @xmath176 , implying that ugc  7321 is a highly dark - matter dominated galaxy .",
    "to first order , the total-  distribution of ugc  7321 is regular and symmetric with a slight depression near its center , and extends to approximately 1.5  times the stellar radius .",
    "the deprojected  surface density is low ( peak value @xmath177 pc @xmath57 ) , which is consistent with other lsb spirals .",
    "the outer  disk of ugc  7321 displays mild flaring in addition to an `` integral sign '' warp that commences near the edge of the stellar disk .",
    "the warped material bends back toward the equatorial plane in the outermost regions .",
    "the origin of this warp is still not understood , as ugc  7321 appears to be an isolated galaxy .",
    "the nearest known companions to ugc  7321 are two dwarf galaxies , both with projected distances of 0.34 d@xmath8  mpc and @xmath178  which would have had their last encounter with ugc  7321 @xmath93  years ago .",
    "in addition , the observations described in this paper rule out the presence of any close gas - rich companions with  masses greater than 2.2@xmath179  ( @xmath180 ) within @xmath181 ( 36  d@xmath8  kpc ) .    the  disk of ugc  7321 appears thicker and more complex than what a single , cold  layer confined to the midplane would display . however , the projection effects expected from warping and flaring of the gas layer have to be modelled in order to untangle the three - dimensional structure of the galaxy , which is complicated by its near - edge - on orientation .",
    "in addition , we detect filaments of gas extending to distances of up to @xmath1060@xmath0 ( 2.9  d@xmath8  kpc ) from the mid - plane in the total intensity  images and in the position - velocity cuts along the minor axis of the disk , which suggests the presence of high - latitude gas .",
    "the position - velocity plot along the major axis of ugc  7321 displays a `` figure-8 '' pattern that we interpret as a manifestation of the warping of the  disk .",
    "in addition , the diagram reveals the presence of a small bar or inner arm .",
    "overall ugc  7321 has a rather regular  velocity field with only minor perturbations .",
    "similarly , the  rotation curve of ugc  7321 exhibits only a mild asymmetry about the two sides of the disk .",
    "the rotation curve rises rather slowly and linearly throughout the stellar disk , indicating a low central matter density ; this effect can not be attributed to the finite spatial resolution of our observations .",
    "a peak rotational velocity of @xmath10110  is reached near 0.9 optical radii , and a slight decline in the rotation curve occurs in the last few measured points .",
    "two possible interpretations of this decline are that the dark matter halo of ugc  7321 is truncated near the edge of the  disk or that we are seeing a projection effect due to the warping of the  layer .",
