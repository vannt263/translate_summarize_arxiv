    "in recent years , there has been a great interest in the study of the origin of the heavy fermion ( hf ) behavior observed in the paramagnetic transition - metal oxide @xmath0 .",
    "this compound has a spinel structure and its pyrochlore lattice consists of corner - shared tetrahedrons of @xmath4 ions located in slightly distorted oxygen octahedron .",
    "it is the first metal showing heavy fermion behavior without any @xmath5 orbital  @xcite .",
    "the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath6 j / mol k@xmath7 at @xmath8 k is the highest value measured for 3d transition - metal oxides .",
    "in addition to having quasi - particles with an unusually heavy effective mass , @xmath0 has some peculiar magnetic properties . the magnetic susceptibility and",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements indicate a spin liquid behavior over a large range of intermediate temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the absence of magnetic order indicates that geometrical frustration , due to the pyrochore structure , is relevant in this system  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the recent neutron scattering experiments  @xcite reveal that in addition to antiferromagnetic correlations , ferromagnetic - like correlations on v sites appear over some temperature range .",
    "these observations are inconsistent with the classical spin - liquid picture , and demonstrate that itinerant contribution of strongly correlated electrons , which could lead to the effective ferromagnetic exchange interaction between localized spins is also important .",
    "there were some suggestions to explain hf behavior in @xmath9 using analogy with @xmath10systems where these effects are attributed to the hybridization of localized @xmath10levels and itinerant @xmath11 bands . this analogy has been based on the fact that according to the band structure calculations  @xcite the trigonal distortion splits @xmath12 orbitals into singlet @xmath1 and doublet @xmath13 states , and the center of @xmath1 band lies lower than that of @xmath13 band .",
    "therefore , one can make a plausible assumption and treat @xmath1 level as being occupied by a localized electron , whereas consider @xmath13 doublet as a quarter filled conducting band  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the magnetic properties of @xmath0 within the exact diagonalization analysis of a small cluster .",
    "the model that we consider includes both purely heisenberg - like contribution from the super - exchange interaction among localized spins and an effective ferromagnetic double - exchange contribution driven by the itinerant electronic excitations .",
    "+ in order to capture some charge fluctuation of the system , we solve the model exactly for the cluster consisting of two disconnected tetrahedrons with either 5 and 7 electrons , or only with 6 electrons , projecting out higher energy states with 4 and 8 electrons .",
    "in order to consider some charge fluctuations , we study a cluster of two isolated tetrahedrons , i.e. we do nt take into account either the super - exchange interaction between localized spins of different tetrahedrons or the hopping of electrons between them .",
    "for this cluster , we can write the total hamiltonian as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is defined on a single tetrahedron : @xmath16 -j_h\\sum_{i } { \\bf s}_{i}^{a}{\\bf \\sigma}_{i}^{a}+ j\\sum_{i\\neq j}{\\bf s}_{i}^{a}{\\bf s}_{j}^{a}.   \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the tetrahedron s index ; @xmath18 are @xmath19-spins representing the localized @xmath1 electrons ; @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an itinerant electron with spin @xmath22 and orbital @xmath23 , corresponding to the @xmath3-doublet .",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) describes the electron hopping between the nearest neighbor v ions , @xmath24 being the transfer amplitude .",
    "the second term concerns the hund s coupling @xmath25 between the localized spins @xmath26 and the local spin density @xmath27 of the itinerant @xmath3-electrons .",
    "finally , the last term describes the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic super - exchange interaction @xmath28 among localized spins .",
    "here we consider infinite on - site coulomb repulsion between itinerant electrons and project out states with double occupancy .    considering only direct overlap between @xmath29 wave functions [ @xmath30 ev , @xmath31 ev ]  @xcite",
    ", transfer matrix elements @xmath32 can be easily calculated using the table i of the paper by slater and koster  @xcite .",
    "+ in further analysis , we consider the value of heisenberg exchange coupling @xmath33 mev which is in agreement with the estimates given in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the hund s coupling @xmath25 is known to be little screened in solids , and can be simply related to its atomic value .",
    "the estimates reported in the literature suggests that @xmath34 ev  @xcite .",
    "we use in our study the value @xmath35 ev obtained by the lda+u ab initio calculations  @xcite , however we also consider the variation of @xmath25 over a wider range .      to define the hilbert space , we choose a basis in which each state @xmath36 is a product @xmath37 where the state @xmath38 characterizes the tetrahedron @xmath17 .",
    "the index @xmath39 is the number of electrons ( localized plus itinerant ) for the tetrahedron @xmath40 , with an averaged charge of 6 electrons per tetrahedron @xmath41 . for a given tetrahedron , the spin state @xmath42 characterizes the total spin of the four localized electrons .",
    "these four spins can be coupled either to singlet , triplet or quintet states .",
    "if hund coupling is neglected , considering only the antiferromagnetic super - exchange interaction , the ground state consists of two - fold degenerate singlet with energy @xmath43 , followed by ninefold degenerate triplet states and five quintet states with the energy @xmath44 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath45 describes all the remaining degrees of freedom , in our case , the spin state and the orbital and site occupancy of the itinerant electrons on the considered tetrahedron .    in order to calculate both the ground state and the finite - temperature properties of the cluster of two isolated tetrahedrons ,",
    "first , we performed a numerical exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath46 characterizing one tetrahedron .",
    "because of large degeneracy , the hilbert space of one tetrahedron consists of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 states for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 electrons , respectively .",
    "however , since the hamiltonian is invariant under rotation of the total spin , it is also diagonal by blocks in the basis of the eigenstates of the total spin ( itinerant plus localized ) .      for a given temperature @xmath53 , the average value of an operator @xmath54 ( e.g. the nearest neighbors spin - spin correlation ) is defined by the usual relation @xmath55 choosing a basis diagonalizing either the operator @xmath54 or the hamiltonian , this relation can be rewritten as @xmath56 here , the density matrix @xmath57 is the probability for the state @xmath36 to be occupied at temperature @xmath58 . using the definition eq .",
