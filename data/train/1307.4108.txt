    "bondi - hoyle accretion is the evolution of a homogeneously distributed gas moving uniformly toward a central compact object @xcite .",
    "a summary of studies in newtonian gravity can be found in @xcite .",
    "the relativistic bondy - hoyle accretion was first analyzed in @xcite , where axially symmetric numerical simulations were carried out in order to study the different matter patterns developed by the gas during the accretion process onto a black hole .",
    "later , the authors in @xcite studied the relativistic bondi - hoyle accretion onto schwarzschild and kerr black holes , in one case considering axisymmetric fluxes and in a second case , general non - axisymmetric fluxes in the equatorial plane using s - lab symmetry , that is , whatever happens on the equatorial plane is assumed to happen along the directions perpendicular to it .",
    "the authors confirm the formation of a shock cone when the fluid is supersonic and study the dependence of the morphology on the parameters of the wind and the black hole . in astrophysical contexts , in @xcite it was shown that the shock cone vibrations can be associated with sources of high energy quasi periodical oscillating signals ( qpos ) , and found a flip - flop type of unstable oscillation of the shock cone .",
    "however later , it was shown in @xcite that the flip - flop oscillation of the shock cone depends on the coordinates used to describe the rotating black hole , specifically it was found that the flip - flop oscillation does not appear when penetrating coordinates are used . on the other hand , considering axially symmetric fluxes , the shock cone oscillation , as a potential source of qpos were studied in @xcite .",
    "more realistic scenarios incorporate astrophysically relevant ingredients like magnetic fields @xcite and radiative terms @xcite to the bondi - hoyle accretion .    the ultrarelativistic bondi - hoyle accretion on a rotating black hole was recently reported in @xcite , considering axisymmetric fluxes . in this work we present a numerical study of ultrarelativistic bondi - hoyle accretion on a rotating black hole in the equatorial plane with s - lab symmetry . in our study",
    "we describe the rotating black hole space - time using kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "specifically , we only focus in supersonic fluxes .",
    "we use a perfect fluid to model the ultrarelativistic gas , with stress - energy tensor @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are the components of the 4-velocity of a fluid element , @xmath3 its pressure and @xmath4 are the components of the metric of the space - time background .",
    "the ultrarelativistic euler equations can be derived from the local conservation of the stress - energy tensor @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the covariant derivative consistent with the 4-metric @xmath4 .",
    "the conservation of mass is satisfied identically in the ultrarelativistic case .",
    "an ultrarelativistic fluid has internal energy sufficiently large that the rest mass density is negligible , that is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the specific internal energy .",
    "this condition implies that approximately the energy density is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we use an ideal gas equation of state @xmath10 which reduces to @xmath11 for the ultrarelativistic case , where @xmath12 is the ratio between specific heats , that corresponds for example , to radiation when @xmath0 .",
    "we use the standard 3 + 1 decomposition to describe the space - time background @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the shift vector , @xmath15 the lapse function and @xmath16 are the components of the spatial 3-metric . using this decomposition of space - time , the ultrarelativistic euler equations , on the equatorial plane ( @xmath17 ) , can be written in flux balance law form @xcite as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the determinant of the spatial 3-metric , @xmath20 is the vector whose entries are the conservative variables , which are in terms of the original primitive variables @xmath21 .",
    "the vectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the fluxes along the @xmath24 and @xmath25 spatial directions respectively and @xmath26 is a source vector field .",

    "we study numerically the ultrarelativistic gas on the equatorial plane , in the domain @xmath32 \\times   [ 0,2\\pi)$ ] .",
    "we choose the interior boundary @xmath33 to be inside the black hole horizon , were we apply excision @xcite .",
    "the exterior boundary @xmath34 , is splitted in to two halves , one in which the gas enters the domain where we apply inflow boundary conditions , and a second half where the gas leaves the domain and we apply outflow boundary conditions there .    _",

    "we also use an atmosphere to avoid the divergence of the internal enthalpy .",

    "_ morphology . _",
    "the ultrarelativistic gas that is moving with supersonic velocity is characterized by the formation of the shock cone in the rear part of the black hole , which is a low pressure region and a bow shock at the front side of the hole , which is a high pressure zone expanding spherically in opposite direction to the gas flow . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the morphology of the pressure for a gas with a supersonic velocity @xmath44 , feeding a rotating black hole with angular momentum @xmath52 .",

    "we show a slice of the pressure along the @xmath38 axis at a given time , in which we can appreciate the high pressure in the bow shock and a low pressure in shock cone .",
    "we found a similar behavior of the pressure for different values of the black hole angular momentum . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show an example of how the rotation of the black hole deforms the shock cone near the event horizon . if the effects of the rotation of a black hole accreting ultrarelativistic ( and relativistic @xcite ) gas are to be measured , they have to be associated to the regions pretty close to the black hole .     and @xmath52 .",

    "we have shown that the rotation of the black hole induces a deformation of the shock cone at short distances from the event horizon and not far from the black hole , where we expect the streaming properties of the gas dominate over the gravitation field .",
