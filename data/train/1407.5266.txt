    "in recent years , mesoscopic methods such as stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd )  @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd )  @xcite and the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm )  @xcite appeared as alternatives to conventional computational fluid dynamic ( cfd ) methods for the simulation of several complex fluid dynamical problems    the original lattice boltzmann method , proposed as probability density based ( and hence a coarse grained ) counterpart of lattice - gas cellular automata @xcite , attracted much interest to be a practical computational fluid dynamics tool . however , one of the major drawbacks of the original lattice boltzmann method was its restriction to uniform lattices , leading to problems when dealing with practical cfd applications . in order to overcome this limitation",
    ", many efforts were undertaken to enhance lbm s efficiency when dealing with complex geometries or multi scale problems which require non - uniform or unstructured grids .",
    "these extensions of the standard lbm are generally motivated by the conventional cfd methods . among the most important techniques",
    "are local grid refinement @xcite , interpolation supplemented finite difference method @xcite as well as various types of finite volume formulations @xcite .",
    "these different approaches extent the lattice boltzmann method to non - uniform and even unstructured grids . among these methods ,",
    "finite volume approaches are of a rather simple and flexible form .",
    "as the name suggests , in a finite volume approach , the space is divided into a number of subvolumes , each containing a finite ( but not necessarily equal ) fraction of the total available volume of the computational domain . when applying to a space spanned by lattice nodes ( as is the case in the lattice boltzmann method ) , division of the space is done in such a way as to ensure that each subvolume contains ( surrounds ) one and only one lattice node .",
    "the time evolution ( update ) of the population densities assigned to a given lattice node is then governed by the net mass current into the subvolume containing that node .",
    "obviously , the net mass flux into a subvolume is computed as the surface integral of the mass flux vector projected onto the direction normal to the surface surrounding the node under consideration .",
    "although finite volume formulations are used extensively , there is still lack of analytical analysis of this type of lbm modifications .",
    "there are , however , some theoretical arguments , based on the inspection of the dispersion relation associated with the unstructured lattice boltzmann scheme @xcite . more recently , through establishing a link between the lattice boltzmann scheme and the finite volume method , general relations that define mass and momentum fluxes is proposed and the treatment of the boundary condition is studied @xcite . here",
    "we will perform a full chapman - enskog analysis of some typical finite volume approaches to introduce a framework for further analytical investigations . in order to keep the presentation and the subsequent analysis as simple as possible , we choose a two dimensional uniform mesh .",
    "this allows us to focus on generic features of different finite volume lattice boltzmann methods . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cv ] , each cell is a square , including one standard lbm grid point , placed at its center .",
    "boundaries of the cell are located in the middle of the standard lbm grid points .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ lbm ] is a review of the original lattice boltzmann method . in sections",
    "[ col ] and [ pro ] , we present the evolution of the velocity of each cell during a single time step , considering details of different finite volume schemes .",
    "section [ ma ] describes the multiscale analysis of the finite volume schemes introduced in section [ pro ] .",
    "section [ dis ] discusses the results and concludes the paper .",
    "there are excellent monographs @xcite and comprehensive review articles @xcite on the lattice boltzmann method and the related lattice - gas cellular automata ( lgca ) . historically , the lattice boltzmann method directly evolved from the lattice - gas cellular automata ( lgca )  @xcite .",
    "particles represented by boolean numbers in the lgca are replaced by single - particle distribution functions .",
    "consequently , the lattice boltzmann method inherits some properties from the lgca , including the coupling between the discrete velocity space and the spatial space as well as the conservation of mass and momentum .",
    "however , it is important to realize that , despite this historical connection between the lgca and the lbm , the lattice boltzmann method can also be derived in a way completely independent of the lattice - gas cellular automata , namely from the kinetic boltzmann equation in a certain approximation @xcite . similar to the lgca , dynamics of evolution in the lattice boltzmann method can formally be divided into two basic steps in each iteration ; namely , ( i ) collision and ( ii ) propagation . as mentioned above ,",
    "both mass and momentum are conserved during the collision step .",
    "this is a necessary ( but not always sufficient ) condition in order to recover the correct hydrodynamic behavior in the macroscopic limit . generally , this property of the collision step is common to all mesoscopic approaches aiming at dealing with hydrodynamic phenomena such as lgca , lbm , srd and dpd . in the propagation step of the lgca or the lbm ,",
    "on the other hand , the post - collision particles or distribution functions are advected entirely ( without any change ) along the link connecting two neighboring lattice nodes ( free streaming ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the two dimensional nine velocity ( d2q9 ) lattice boltzmann model ( see fig .  [ uniformlattice ] ) .",
    "using the so called bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) approximation @xcite , the equation of the evolution of the discretized distribution functions , @xmath0 is + @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the time step , @xmath3 is the relaxation time and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the equilibrium distribution function , @xmath6 is an applied body force which is assumed to be constant and @xmath7 indicates different directions of physical coordinate system , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the d2q9 model used in the present paper , the index @xmath10 refers to the nine discrete velocities defined by + @xmath11,\\sin[(i-1)\\pi/2])c & i=1 , 2 , 3 , 4,\\\\ \\sqrt{2}(\\cos[(i-5)\\pi/2+\\pi/4],\\sin[(i-5)\\pi/2+\\pi/4])c & i=5 , 6 , 7 , 8 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is defined as the ratio of the lattice spacing and the time step , @xmath13 .",
    "+ physical properties of the system enter the lattice boltzmann iteration scheme via the quantity @xmath5 equation  ( [ eq : evolution ] ) .",
    "obviously , the system is pushed towards @xmath5 with a rate @xmath14 . the population density @xmath5 is , therefore , referred to as equilibrium distribution. it is noteworthy that the term equilibrium does not refer to a global thermal equilibrium , where no flow exists .",
    "rather , it describes the _ local _ velocity distribution in a portion of fluid moving at a velocity @xmath15 . within the present lattice boltzmann model ,",
    "one expands @xmath5 in powers of the fluid velocity , @xmath16 , up to the second order recalling the second order expansion of the maxwell velocity distribution .",
    "this leads to @xmath17 where the weight factors @xmath18 are given by ( for a derivation , see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath19 macroscopic quantities such as density and momentum are obtained locally as the zeroth and the first moments of the population density , @xmath20 , respectively : @xmath21 in order to estimate momentum exchange between cells through their boundaries , the momentum flux tensor is needed .",
    "it can be defined as @xmath22 in the above equation , @xmath7 and @xmath23 indicate different directions of cartesian coordinate system , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that , since @xmath24 , the term with @xmath25 has no effect on the fluid velocity as well as the momentum flux tensor .",
    "it is of common practice to decompose equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) into two parts , the first part is the so called collision step and the second one implements the free propagation ( streaming ) of the distribution functions between two neighboring lattice nodes directly linked via the velocity vector @xmath26 . . @xmath27",
    "it can be easily shown that the requirement of mass and momentum conservation during the collision step is equivalent to the following two conditions on the moments of the distribution function , @xmath20 , namely @xmath28 in the next two sections , we show how the velocity of each cell changes during these two steps in a single iteration cycle .",
    "although the collision step is modified differently in each finite volume lattice boltzmann scheme , the mass and momentum conserving properties of the standard lattice boltzmann method are not violated in any of those schemes .",
    "consequently , the collision step bluedoes not change the momentum of the cells . will increase by a constant when the external field is constant .",
    "after the collision step , the system undergoes a propagation step , during which the momentum of cells can change due to the exchange of particles . however , in the standard lattice boltzmann method , populations , @xmath20 , are advected entirely ( i.e.  with no loss or gain ) between two neighboring lattice nodes linked along the velocity vector @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast to this , within a finite volume approach , one first determines the total mass flux as well as the momentum flux through the cell s boundaries by integrating the component of the corresponding current projected onto the direction _",
    "normal _ to the cell s surface .",
    "more formally , and considering the case of momentum exchange , one computes the total change in momentum of a cell via @xmath29.\\ ] ] here , the integral is over the whole boundary of a cell . for the simple case of a regular rectangular lattice , each node can be surrounded by a rectangular finite volume cell . in this case , the above integral reduces to @xmath30 \\\\",
    "\\label{deltap1 } & = & { { \\sum_{i=1}^{8 } } } c_{i \\alpha } c_{i x } [ { \\ensuremath{f_{i}^{\\mathrm{av}}}}({{\\ensuremath{{\\bm{r}}}}}+ \\frac{\\delta x}{2 } { { \\ensuremath{{\\bm{i } } } } } ) - { \\ensuremath{f_{i}^{\\mathrm{av}}}}({{\\ensuremath{{\\bm{r}}}}}- \\frac{\\delta x}{2}{{\\ensuremath{{\\bm{i } } } } } ) ] \\delta y \\\\ \\nonumber & + & { { \\sum_{i=1}^{8 } } } c_{i \\alpha } c_{i y } [ { \\ensuremath{f_{i}^{\\mathrm{av}}}}({{\\ensuremath{{\\bm{r}}}}}+\\frac{\\delta y}{2 } { { \\ensuremath{{\\bm{j}}}}})-{\\ensuremath{f_{i}^{\\mathrm{av}}}}({{\\ensuremath{{\\bm{r}}}}}-\\frac{\\delta y}{2 } { { \\ensuremath{{\\bm{j } } } } } ) ] \\delta x .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the average of @xmath20 over the corresponding edge of the cell .",
    "the first two terms in equation  ( [ deltap1 ] ) arise from fluxes across the right and left boundaries ( @xmath32 ) whereas the terms proportional to @xmath33 represent the contribution of the flux through the top and bottom edges of the cell ( @xmath34 ) . in order to simplify the notation , we make use of einstein summation convention over repeated indices and rewrite equation  ( [ deltap1 ] ) as @xmath35 c \\delta y \\\\ \\nonumber   & + & c_{i \\alpha } [ { \\ensuremath{f_{i}^{\\mathrm{av}}}}({{\\ensuremath{{\\bm{r}}}}}+\\frac{c_{i y}\\delta",

    "therefore , we discuss in the next subsection the details of different methods of evaluating @xmath31 , including the central scheme and constant as well as linear upwind schemes @xcite . by conducting a full chapman - enskog analysis of these finite volume schemes in section [ ma ] , we also study the resulting macroscopic equations and , in particular , the relation between the relaxation time , @xmath3 , and the kinematic viscosity , @xmath36 , within each approximate method .      as mentioned above , in order to estimate fluxes , @xmath31 should be evaluated at the cell faces . in the context of finite volume methods , there are many different approaches for flux evaluation @xcite . in this paper , two different upwind schemes introduced by steibler et al .",
    "@xcite and one central scheme introduced by peng et al .",
    "@xcite are analyzed .      a very simple upwind scheme results from the following approximation @xmath37 @xmath38 + inserting equations ( [ upwindconstdefinitionx1 ] ) and ( [ upwindconstdefinitiony1 ] ) into equation  ( [ deltap ] )",

    ", this gives rise to a finite numerical viscosity within the constant upwind approach , an artifact absent both in the central and linear upwind schemes .",
    "average value of @xmath20 over each face of the cell can be determined by averaging between distribution functions at the both ends of the corresponding face but end points of the cells are not coinciding with the lattice nodes so the values of @xmath43 are not known and should be approximated .",
    "each end point has four neighboring lattice nodes and values of @xmath43s at these point can be used to interpolate the value of distribution functions at the corresponding end point .",
    "it can be easily shown that + @xmath44 @xmath45 substituting equation ( [ centralschemedifinitionx ] ) , as an approximation of @xmath31 , in the first term of equation ( [ deltap ] ) leads to    & @xmath46(r+@xmath41)-@xmath46(@xmath40-@xmath41)= + & = -= + & = = + & = c_i xt_x f_i _ @xmath40+o((x)^3 ) [ centeralschemeax ]    it must be emphasized that terms related to second derivatives of @xmath20s will cancel each other and despite the fact that only first derivatives of @xmath20s appear in equation ( [ centeralschemeax ] ) , the first non - vanishing error term is of the order @xmath47 .",

    "in this section we introduce a multi scale expansion of the distribution function around the equilibrium distribution function @xcite @xmath55 and the derivatives @xmath56 into different schemes discussed above .",
    "the first term is the equilibrium distribution function ( @xmath57 ) and the first non - equilibrium term of equation ( [ enskog_expansion ] ) , @xmath58 , can be approximated as @xmath59 where @xmath6 is the external force .",
    "equations ( [ centerala ] ) and ( [ upwindlinea ] ) are identical .",
    "the chapman - enskog analysis of equation ( [ centerala ] ) is done here and the result is also valid for equation ( [ upwindlinea ] ) .",

    "it can be seen that the kinematic viscosity , @xmath36 , will be different among the different schemes : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the sound speed .",
    "as shown here , different approaches for solving the boltzmann equation may result in different values for the viscosity .",
    "the viscosity estimated from the chapman - enskog analysis of the boltzmann equation with the bgk approximation is exactly @xmath68 and the difference between @xmath68 and the viscosity obtained from the numerical scheme is referred to as numerical viscosity .",
    "the numerical viscosity is an artifact of the solution method and generally undesirable . through the chapman - enskog analysis we showed that the numerical viscosity identically vanishes both within the central scheme and the linear upwind schemes . the constant upwind scheme , on the other hand , yields a finite numerical viscosity of @xmath69 .",
    "even though undesirable , this numerical viscosity admits the positivity of the numerical viscosity as reported in @xcite .",
    "+ generally speaking , regarding the accuracy , some finite difference schemes and finite volume schemes will result in the same set of discrete equations in the limit of a uniform lattice .",
    "comparison of constant upwind scheme and central scheme in present work with their finite difference lattice boltzmann equivalents shows agreement in value of viscosity @xcite .",
    "it is typical of first order schemes ( e.g. constant upwind scheme ; see equation ( [ upwindconsa ] ) and the comment on it ) to show higher viscosity in comparison to second order schemes ( e.g. central scheme ) , which are expected to show oscillations in the solution @xcite .",
    "+ [ line - through ] * * in summary , we introduced a systematic procedure , which enables further analysis of the finite volume lattice boltzmann methods and presented a derivation of the relation between the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and the lattice boltzmann relaxation parameter for some typical approximate schemes for the flux evaluation within the finite volume approach to the lattice boltzmann method .",
    "the next step in this framework could be the analytical study of different boundary conditions , the effect of boundary condition on the stress tensor , slip as an artifact in mesoscopic methods",
    "the chapman - enskog expansion is a method to derive the navier - stokes equation and its transport coefficients from the boltzmann equation .",
    "this method has been developed by chapman and enskog @xcite . .",

    "an example consider the expansion @xmath75 . in discussions",
    "one may consider @xmath71 and @xmath76 as quantities of the same order of magnitude and argue that the second term of the expansion is small because @xmath65 is a small quantity whereas in the formal calculations @xmath76 is small compared to @xmath71 and @xmath65 is only a label to keep track of the relative size of the various terms .",
    "the @xmath65 in this second sense can be set equal to one after finishing all transformations . as the last point about equation ( [ app_enskog_expansion ] )",
    ", one should mention that the series resulting from the chapman - enskog procedure is probably not convergent but asymptotic  .",
    "+ considering the steady state case , only spatial changes of @xmath20 are taken into account and temporal derivations of the distribution functions will vanish .",

    "<S> a complete iteration cycle in time evolution of discretized distribution functions is formally divided into collision and propagation ( streaming ) steps . considering mass and momentum conserving properties of the collision step , </S>",
    "<S> it becomes obvious that changes in the momentum of finite volume cells is just due to the propagation step . </S>",
    "<S> details of the propagation step are discussed for different approximate schemes for the evaluation of fluxes at the boundaries of the finite volume cells . moreover , a full chapman - enskog analysis is conducted allowing to recover the navier - stokes equation . as an important result of this analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the lattice boltzmann relaxation time and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid is derived for each approximate flux evaluation scheme . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the constant upwind scheme leads to a positive numerical viscosity while the central scheme as well as the linear upwind scheme are free of this artifact . </S>"
