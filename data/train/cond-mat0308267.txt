    "in recent years there has been renewed interest in the degeneracies exhibited by the integrable six - vertex model and the associated xxz quantum spin - chain , @xmath1 when the anisotropy parameter is evaluated at roots of unity @xmath2 . in @xcite deguchi , fabricius and mccoy showed for the commensurate sectors @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 being the total spin ) that the model with periodic boundary conditions exhibits an @xmath5 $ ] loop algebra symmetry . outside these commensurate sectors the algebraic structure of the symmetry algebra has so far not been established except for the case of the xx model , i.e. vanishing anisotropy parameter , and a numerical construction for @xmath6 see @xcite for details .",
    "in two recent works @xcite the twisted xxz chain at roots of unity has been investigated , @xmath7 in @xcite various operators have been constructed which ( anti)commute with the twisted xxz hamiltonian and the associated transfer matrix . except for the cases @xmath8 the algebraic structure underlying these operators has not been identified .",
    "similar as for the periodic case the @xmath9 symmetry algebra for @xmath8 has been restricted to certain commensurate spin - sectors .",
    "the discussion in @xcite has also been extended to include the case of the inhomogeneous chain .    in the second work @xcite the construction of operators creating complete",
    "strings for the periodic homogeneous chain carried out in @xcite has been generalised to cover also the twisted and inhomogeneous case .",
    "the construction of the symmetry algebra underlying the degeneracies in the spectra of the hamiltonian and the transfer matrix has not been investigated .    in this letter",
    "it is shown that when the twist parameter is chosen to depend on the total spin , i.e. @xmath10 , the quantum spin chain hamiltonian and the associated twisted six - vertex transfer matrix exhibit infinite - dimensional non - abelian symmetries and their algebraic structure is identified with the lower respectively upper borel subalgebra @xmath11 in _ all _ spin sectors . in the sectors",
    "@xmath3 one obviously recovers the periodic chain and the symmetry is enhanced to the full loop algebra @xmath12 reproducing the aforementioned result of @xcite .",
    "however , also for the periodic case we give a novel proof of the symmetry which only uses the framework of the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite and quantum group theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , it avoids having first to prove translation invariance , cf .",
    "the extension to the inhomogeneous case is also discussed .",
    "starting point of our discussion is the six - vertex @xmath13-matrix which is given by @xmath14 where we choose the following parametrization of the boltzmann weights @xmath15 here @xmath16 denotes the ( multiplicative ) spectral parameter and @xmath17 is the deformation parameter appearing in the spin - chain hamiltonians ( [ h ] ) and ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "central to our discussion will be the properties of the ( inhomogeneous ) six - vertex monodromy matrix which one usually decomposes over the two - dimensional auxiliary space , @xmath18 the explicit dependence on the spectral parameter and the inhomogeneity parameters @xmath19 will be often suppressed in the notation in order to unburden the formulas .",
    "the twisted six - vertex transfer matrix is now defined as the trace @xmath20 for the homogeneous chain @xmath21 we obtain up to an additive constant the spin - chain hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) as the following logarithmic derivative @xmath22 obviously , the twist does not alter the algebraic relations of the yang - baxter algebra defined in terms of @xmath23 in ( [ mom ] ) . in order to discuss the symmetries of ( [ ham ] ) and ( [ t ] ) when the deformation parameter @xmath17 is a root of unity we first establish a number of relations between the chevalley - serre basis of the quantum group @xmath24 and the matrix elements of the monodromy matrix ( [ mom ] ) for generic @xmath17 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is well known that the underlying algebraic structure of the six - vertex model is the quantum loop algebra @xmath24 .",
    "its algebraic definition @xcite in terms of the chevalley - serre basis is @xmath26 where the cartan matrix reads @xmath27 in addition one has to impose for @xmath28 the chevalley - serre relations , @xmath29_{q}e_{i}^{2}e_{j}e_{i}+[3]_{q}e_{i}e_{j}e_{i}^{2}-e_{j}e_{i}^{3 } & = & 0 \\notag \\\\ f_{i}^{3}f_{j}-[3]_{q}f_{i}^{2}f_{j}f_{i}+[3]_{q}f_{i}f_{j}f_{i}^{2}-f_{j}f_{i}^{3 } & = & 0\\;. \\label{cs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantum algebra can be made into a hopf algebra upon defining a coproduct which we choose to be @xmath30 the opposite coproduct @xmath31 is obtained by permuting the two factors .",
    "the six - vertex @xmath13-matrix intertwines the two coproduct structures in the case of the spin @xmath32 representation , i.e. @xmath33 with the representation @xmath34 given in terms of pauli matrices by @xmath35 from the fusion relation @xmath36 an analogous intertwining relation follows for the monodromy matrix ( [ mom ] ) with regard to the quantum group generators on the quantum spin - chain @xmath37 , @xmath38 here @xmath39 as before ) in accordance with the parametrization ( [ abc ] ) of the boltzmann weights .",
    "equally well , we could have used the principal gradation in which the six - vertex r - matrix ( [ r ] ) is symmetric .",
    "then all chevalley - serre generators in ( [ pi0 ] ) would acquire a spectral parameter dependence and the generators ( [ kef ] ) would correspond to those discussed in equation ( 50 ) of @xcite .",

    "we obtain the relations @xmath72 and @xmath73 thus , upon inserting @xmath74 we now infer immediately that whenever the terms in the brackets vanish we obtain a symmetry algebra . for periodic boundary conditions , @xmath75 , we recover the previously obtained loop algebra symmetry @xmath12 in the commensurate sectors @xmath3 @xcite . for twisted boundary conditions with @xmath76",
    "we apparently only obtain `` half '' the symmetry algebra , namely @xmath77 , in the spin sectors @xmath78 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cartan generators @xmath79 appear with inverse powers in ( [ tb ] ) compared to the ones in ( [ tb++ ] ) .",

    "note that the case of periodic boundary conditions @xcite is contained in these models for the sectors @xmath3 , where both transfer matrices coincide and the symmetry is enhanced to the full loop algebra .",
    "let us summarize the established symmetry algebras for the twisted inhomogeneous six - vertex model and their corresponding commensurate sectors in the following table ,        note that the above findings do not exclude the possibility that the symmetries found @xcite for the boundary conditions @xmath92 can be extended to all spin - sectors as well .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions @xmath75 it has been argued in @xcite that one might have to use projection operators to obtain the symmetry algebra in the incommensurate sectors . as mentioned in the introduction",
    "this has been explicitly demonstrated at the free fermion point , i.e. the xx model ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "for @xmath94 it has been proven that operators of the type @xmath95 etc .",
    "commute with the transfer matrix when @xmath75 and @xmath96 , cf .",
    "equation ( 3.42 ) and section 3.5 , appendix a.5 in @xcite . in equation",
    "( 3.43 ) of the same work eight operators are stated which should ( anti)commute with the transfer matrix in the incommensurate sector @xmath96 and a numerical procedure is described how the loop algebra relations have been verified for @xmath97 .    for the transfer matrices ( [ tpm ] ) we obviously do not need any projection operators to extend the symmetry to all spin - sectors which indicates that these models possess a higher level of degeneracies in their spectrum compared to the other boundary conditions . that this is indeed the case has been numerically verified in the spin - sectors @xmath98 of the @xmath99 spin - chain when @xmath100",
    "; see graph 1 and graph 2 .",
    "furthermore , our results for the twisted case when @xmath101 suggest that in the incommensurate sectors one might also encounter a smaller symmetry algebra as the spin - sector @xmath3 is clearly distinguished .",
    "we emphasize again that in comparison with previously established non - abelian symmetries , e.g. the _ finite _ quantum group symmetry @xmath102 for the chain with open boundary conditions @xcite , the symmetries established here involve _",
    "infinite_-dimensional algebras which impose more powerful restrictions .",
    "the next step in this context is to relate the representation theory of these algebras to the bethe ansatz .    for periodic boundary conditions @xmath75 this",
    "has already partially been done in @xcite . in @xcite creation operators involving complete strings",
    "have been constructed which involve two polynomials depending on the bethe roots .",
    "based on numerical results one of these polynomials has been conjectured @xcite to coincide with the classical limit ( @xmath103 ) of the drinfeld polynomial @xcite which describes the irreducible representations of the loop algebra @xcite in the sectors @xmath3 .",
    "the previously formulated conjecture @xcite that the regular xxz bethe vectors correspond to the highest weight vectors of the loop algebra has been investigated in @xcite by means of the algebraic bethe ansatz . also here",
    "the results have been limited to the commensurate sectors @xmath3 where the algebraic structure of the symmetry generators has been identified . in @xcite the degeneracies of the periodic six - vertex model have been investigated from a different point of view by applying representation theory to construct analogues of baxter s @xmath104-operator . in @xcite",
    "the classical drinfeld polynomial has been identified in the spectrum of these @xmath104-operators for several explicit examples when @xmath105 .    clearly , the advantage of imposing the quasi - periodic boundary conditions @xmath10 is that the symmetry algebra is now known for all spin - sectors while at the same time leaving the algebraic structure of the bethe ansatz largely unchanged .",
    "this makes the twisted model ( [ tpm ] ) an ideal candidate for representation theoretic investigations and one can expect to find similar results as for the periodic case .",
    "of particular interest in this context is also the study of finite - size effects in the thermodynamic limit , similar to those done in existing numerical investigations of the twisted xxz chain e.g. @xcite .",
    "these issues will be addressed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "finally , it needs to be pointed out that the proof of the infinite - dimensional symmetries given in this article has only made use of the intertwining property of the monodromy matrix .",
    "this property is common to a large class of integrable vertex models associated with trigonometric solutions to the yang - baxter equation and quantum affine ( super)algebras . despite the obvious modifications in the algebraic structure of the yang - baxter algebra",
    "we expect that the results found here can be extended to these models similar as the periodic case has been generalised to other models in @xcite and @xcite ( albeit with different methods ) .    *",
