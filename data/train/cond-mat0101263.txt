    "in two recent short contributions @xcite we showed that the overcharging curves obtained by simulations of the ground state , like fig .",

    "each ion interacts in first approximation only with the oppositely charged background of its wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell@xcite , which can be approximated by a disk of radius @xmath64 , which possesses the same area as the ws cell . because we can assume the area of the ws cell to be evenly distributed among the @xmath42 counterions on the sphere s surface @xmath65 we find    @xmath66    the electrostatic interaction energy @xmath67 of one counterion with the background of its ws cell",

    "moreover the energy increases stronger than linear with the degree of ionization . if one diminishes the bare charge @xmath155 to 90 and 30 , the _ ground state _ is actually the ionized state for a _ di _ of 1 and 3 , respectively .",

    "the gain in energy is also significantly enhanced . for the shortest separation under consideration @xmath135 [ see fig .",

    "( [ eq.finiter ] ) we can establish a simple criterion ( more specifically a sufficient condition ) , valid for large macroionic separations , for the charge asymmetry @xmath183 to produce an ionized ground state of two unlike charged colloids with the same size :    @xmath184    referring to fig .",
    "( [ fig.ionization ] ) this criterion is met when the overcharge curve ( changed sign ) is higher than the ionization curve .    if one uses the parameters of the present study one finds the requirement @xmath185 to get a stable ionized state .",
    "this is consistent with our findings where we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-di ] that for @xmath186 _ _ , _ _ and _ r / a _ = 4.25 , no ionized ground state exists whereas for @xmath187 we observed one even for infinite separation ( not reported here ) .",
    "the criterion eq .",
    "( [ eq.criterion ] ) is merely a sufficient condition , since we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig.gs-di ] that when the colloids are close enough this ionized state can appear even for smaller macroion charge asymmetry due to enhanced inter - colloidal correlations . at this stage , we would like to stress again , that the appearance of a stable ionized ground state is due merely to correlation .",
    "an analogous consideration with smeared out counterion distributions along the lines of eq .",
    "( [ smeared ] ) will again always lead to two colloids exactly neutralized by their counterions @xcite .",
    "our energetical arguments are quite different from the situation encountered at finite temperatures , because in this case even a poisson - boltzmann description would lead to an asymmetric counterion distribution . however , in the latter case this happens due to pure entropic reasons , namely in the limit of high temperatures , the counterions want to be evenly distributed in space , leading to an effective charge asymmetry .    at this stage , on looking at the results presented above , it appears natural and straightforward to establish an analogy with the concept of ionic bonding .",
    "it is well known in chemistry that the electro - negativity concept provides a simple yet powerful way to predict the nature of the chemical bonding @xcite .",
    "if one refers to the original definition of the electro - negativity given by pauling @xcite : `` the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself '' , the role of the bare charge asymmetry becomes obvious .",
    "indeed , it has an equivalent role at the mesoscopic scale as the electron affinity at the microscopic scale .",
    "another interesting analogy is the influence of the colloidal separation on the stability of the ionized state . like in diatomic molecules ,",
    "the ionized state will be ( very ) stable only for sufficiently short colloid separations .",
    "nevertheless , one should not push this analogy too far .",
    "one point where it breaks down concerns the existence of an ionized ground state in colloidal system for _ large _ colloid separation , providing that the difference in the counterion concentration on the surface is large enough . in an atomistic system",
    "this is impossible since even for the most favorable thermodynamical case , namely cscl , there is a cost in energy to transfer an electron from a cesium atom to a chlorine atom .",
    "indeed , the smallest existing ionization energy ( for cs , 376 kj mol@xmath188 ) is greater in magnitude than the largest existing electron affinity ( for cs , 349 kj mol@xmath188 ) . in other terms , for atoms separated by large distances in the gas phase , electron transfer to form ions is always energetically unfavorable .      as a last result , aimed at experimental verification",
    ", we show that an ionized state can also exist _ spontaneously _ at _ room temperature _ @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig.relaxation ] shows the time evolution of the electrostatic energy of a system @xmath154 with @xmath189 , @xmath135 and @xmath190 , where the starting configuration is the neutral state ( _ di _ = 0 ) .",
    "one clearly observes two jumps in energy , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which corresponds each to a counterion transfer from colloid _ b _ to colloid _",
    "these values are consistent with the ones obtained for the ground state , which are@xmath193 and @xmath194 respectively .",
    "note that this ionized state ( _ di _ = 2 ) is more stable than the neutral but is expected to be metastable , since it was shown previously that the most stable ground state corresponds to _ di _ = 5 .",
    "the other stable ionized states for higher _ di _ are not accessible with reasonable computer time because of the high energy barrier made up of the correlational term and the monopole term which increases with _ di _ . in fig .",
    "[ fig.snaphot-di2 ] we display a typical snapshot of the ionized state ( _ di _ = 2 ) of this system at room temperature .",
    "obviously , these results are not expected by a dlvo theory even in the asymmetric case ( see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "previous simulations of asymmetric ( charge and size ) spherical macroions @xcite were also far away to predict such a phenomenon since the coulomb coupling was weak ( water , monovalent counterions ) .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the ground state of a charged sphere in the presence of excess counterions is _ always _ overcharged .",
    "a sufficiently charged colloid can in principle be highly overcharged due to counterion mediated correlation effects , and this phenomenon is quantitatively well described by a simple version of wigner crystal theory . in the strong coulomb coupling regime , the energy gain of a single excess ion close to a counterion layer can be of the order of many tens of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore we demonstrated that the electrostatic interaction between a counterion and a macroion effectively neutralized by its counterions decays exponentially on a length scale which is equal to the wigner crystal hole radius .",
    "we further found that for two _ like - charged _ macroions ( symmetric case ) , an initially randomly placed counterion cloud of their neutralizing divalent counterions may not be equally distributed after relaxation , leading to two macroions of opposite net charges .",
    "this is due to the short range wc attraction which leads to this energetically favorable overcharged state .",
    "the resulting configuration is metastable , however separated by an energy barrier of several @xmath28 when the bare charge is sufficiently large , and can thus survive for long times .",
    "such configuration possess a natural strong long range attraction .    in return , if the symmetry in the counterion concentration on the colloidal surface is sufficiently broken , the ionized state can be _ stable_. the ground state of such a system is mainly governed by two important parameters , namely the asymmetry in the counterion concentration determined by @xmath195 , and the colloid separation _",
    "r_. if the counterion concentration difference is high enough , the ground state corresponds to an ionized state , whatever the macroions separation _",
    "@xmath128 _ is .",
    "however , the degree of ionization depends on _ r_. besides , for large _",
    ", we have established a criterion , allowing to predict when a stable ionized configuration can be expected .",
    "the counterion concentration difference plays an analogous role to the electron affinity between two atoms forming a molecule with ionic bonding .",
    "we demonstrated that the results presented here for the ground state can lead to a stable ionic state even at room temperature providing that the coulomb coupling and/or the counterion concentration asymmetry is sufficiently large .",
    "this is also a possible mechanism which could lead to strong long range attractions , even in bulk .",
    "future work will treat the case where salt ions are present .",
