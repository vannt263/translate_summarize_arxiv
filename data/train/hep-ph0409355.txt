    "field theory in higher dimensions has been providing novel approaches to theoretical and phenomenological problems in recent particle physics .",
    "the existence of extra spatial dimensions beyond our fours is applied to various issues such as the generation of large scale hierarchies  @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "a key ingredient is to determine the size of extra space so that they are viable approaches and do not conflict with current observations .",
    "for example , the planck / weak mass hierarchy is attained by assuming that the radii of compactified dimensions are huge  @xcite or small but a bit larger than the planck length  @xcite .",
    "the compactification radius is also conjectured to have anticipated values in other phenomenological discussions such as small neutrino masses  @xcite , yukawa hierarchies of quarks and leptons  @xcite , and supersymmetry breaking  @xcite . therefore adjusting the sizes of extra dimensions to desired values",
    "is one of the most important issues in higher - dimensional framework .",
    "there have been in the literature various resolutions to this stabilization problem in large- and small - sized extra dimensions  @xcite .    in this paper , we present three different schemes to stabilize the radius modulus in five - dimensional supersymmetric theory with or without charged matter fields .",
    "one is based on the model with only boundary charged fields and another with only bulk fields . in every scheme ,",
    "the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term  @xcite in five - dimensional theory is found to play a crucial role for the radius stabilization .",
    "the resultant metric factor can be significant or nearly flat , depending on model parameters .",
    "it is stressed that the fi term is not introduced by hand in order to stabilize the radius .",
    "a non - vanishing fi term is radiatively generated even if it is set to zero in the classical lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "this is unlike the four - dimensional theory where a fi term does not receive any renormalization if theory has a vanishing gravitational anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the induced fi term depends on how charged matter multiplets are distributed in the extra dimensions and is therefore controllable .",
    "further it is known in four - dimensional models that the fi term is connected to yukawa hierarchy and supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "we construct a five - dimensional model for generating fermion mass hierarchy which is correlated with the radius stabilization .",
    "the model also predicts characteristic spectrum of sfermions and gauginos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a generic form of globally supersymmetric lagrangian for five - dimensional @xmath2 theory with the fi term .",
    "the simplest stabilization scheme is found in section 3 without introducing any matter fields . in section 4 ,",
    "a different scheme is presented to fix the size of extra dimension .",
    "the model contains bulk hypermultiplets with non - trivial wavefunctions whose forms are determined by fi - term coefficients .",
    "the bulk multiplets fix the distance between the two boundaries in terms of boundary couplings . in the vacuum of this model",
    ", supersymmetry is unbroken . with the generic lagrangian at hand ,",
    "we show in section 5 that the radius can be stabilized by only boundary matter fields . that is established by analyzing the vacuum energy in effective four - dimensional theory with broken supersymmetry .",
    "we also construct a toy model for yukawa hierarchy and supersymmetry breaking , deeply correlated with the radius stabilization phenomenon .",
    "such a model predicts a new type of sparticle spectrum in low - energy effective theory .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summarizing our results .",
    "we consider the globally supersymmetric abelian gauge theory in five dimensions .",
    "the fifth dimension is compactified on a line segment @xmath3 , where the radius of the circle @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "the radius @xmath5 is a free parameter of the theory and corresponds to a massless moduli field @xmath6 in four - dimensional effective theory ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the fifth dimension @xmath8 has two boundaries at @xmath9 and @xmath10 . they are fixed points under the @xmath11 orbifolding of physical spacetime .",
    "we are now interested in the case that the extra dimension has curved geometry .",
    "a particularly interesting example is the warped ( ads ) geometry  @xcite whose line element is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ads curvature and @xmath14 the minkowski metric in four dimensions .",
    "this background metric has been intensively studied for realistic model construction with the planck / weak scale difference , quarks and leptons mass hierarchy , the cosmological constant problem , etc . in these",
    "approaches the radius @xmath5 of the compact extra dimension was often assumed to have a desired value , and the radius stabilization is therefore one of the most important problems in constructing realistic ` brane - world ' models . in this paper",
    "we present the schemes to stabilize @xmath5 at a finite value due to the existence of @xmath2 gauge factor in supersymmetric warped dimensions .",
    "we adopt the superspace formalism of higher - dimensional supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "there are two types of supermultiplets generally introduced in five - dimensional theory ; vector and hyper multiplets .",
    "a vector multiplet contains an @xmath15 vector multiplet @xmath16 and a chiral multiplet @xmath17 , whose auxiliary components are denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "a hypermultiplet consists of oppositely - charged two chiral multiplets @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the superspace language ,",
    "the most generic lagrangian for five - dimensional @xmath2 gauge theory is given by @xmath22 @xmath23 ^ 2 , \\label{lv } \\\\[1 mm ]    l_h & \\!=\\ ! & \\int\\ !",

    "the sign function @xmath27 is inserted in order for the orbifold @xmath11 invariance .",
    "we have also included the lagrangian for chiral multiplets confined on the uv ( @xmath9 ) and ir ( @xmath28 ) boundaries ; @xmath29 the orbifold boundary conditions are imposed on each supermultiplet .",
    "the vector multiplet @xmath16 has the neumann boundary conditions at both uv and ir branes and its superpartner multiplet @xmath17 has the dirichlet ones because it contains the fifth component of the bulk gauge field .",
    "the boundary conditions of @xmath20 must be opposite to those of superpartner @xmath21 for respecting the @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath11 boundary conditions break a half of bulk supersymmetry and thus the boundary lagrangians @xmath30 and @xmath31 preserve only the four - dimensional @xmath15 supersymmetry .",
    "for example , yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons are expected to come from these boundary interactions in the present framework .",
    "the boundary chiral multiplets @xmath32 and @xmath33 couple only to bulk multiplets with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we have assumed , for simplicity , that there are no @xmath8-derivative couplings of @xmath11-odd chiral multiplets and no four - dimensional gauge fields on the boundaries , while these assumptions are irrelevant to the following discussion .",
    "the exponential warp factors are explicitly included in the above lagrangian .",
    "these warp factors describe the metric dependences , such as from @xmath34 , of the lowest component of each supermultiplet in the warped background . for other component fields ,",
    "the proper metric factors in the warped five - dimensional action are obtained after some rescaling , for example , @xmath35 , @xmath36 for the auxiliary fields .",
    "since we now consider the abelian gauge theory , a fi term of vector multiplet @xmath16 is gauge invariant in globally supersymmetric theory and can also be added to the lagrangian as @xmath37 we have defined the coefficient @xmath38 into which the metric warp factor is absorbed .",
    "even if there is no fi term in classical lagrangian , it is radiatively generated via tadpole graphs of the @xmath18 component where charged matter fields circulate in the loop . in the case of flat extra dimensions , its form was investigated  @xcite and found to reside only on the orbifold fixed points .",
    "moreover the fi term vanishes in anomaly - free low - energy effective theory when one integrates out the fifth - dimensional physics .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , in four - dimensional theory , a coefficient of radiatively - generated fi term is proportional to the sum of matter @xmath2 charges which also gives the mixed @xmath2-gravitational anomaly . in five - dimensional theory on curved backgrounds including the warped geometry ,",
    "the situation is rather different .",
    "since the fifth direction is curved , the fundamental length depends on the position @xmath8 .",
    "the implication of this fact appears through the metric - factor dependences in the fi - term calculation . in the warped geometry  ( [ warp ] ) ,",
    "the brane - localized fi terms are written as @xmath39 with the constant coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "if the fi term is set to vanish at classical level , radiative corrections give rise to @xmath40 and @xmath41 which are given by specific combinations of @xmath2 charges of bulk and boundary fields  @xcite . for a @xmath2 factor free from gravitational anomaly in low - energy theory ,",
    "the two coefficients are equal to each other ; @xmath42 .",
    "the exponential factor in the second term of ( [ fi ] ) indicates that the fundamental length is redshifted at the @xmath28 boundary .",
    "this factor may be described by proper regularization , for example ,  la pauli - villars , and more simply implemented by a position - dependent cutoff for the four - dimensional momentum in the one - loop calculations , which dependence is suggested by the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . that has been recently confirmed by detailed analysis of five - dimensional supergravity  @xcite . in four - dimensional effective theory ,",
    "the fi term does not vanish as the zero modes of vector multiplet have flat wavefunctions . as a result , either @xmath2 gauge symmetry or four - dimensional supersymmetry is broken at the scale of @xmath38 .",
    "this reflects the known fact in four - dimensional theory that a fi term for anomaly - free @xmath2 gauge theory does not coexist with unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "that is , in four - dimensional supergravity theory , a fi term can be introduced only when @xmath2 is @xmath5 symmetry or non - linearly realized , i.e.  the @xmath2 gauge boson becomes massive .",
    "an important point here is that even if low - energy theory is totally free of anomalies like qed , the effective fi term is non - vanishing due to the curved extra dimension ( @xmath43 ) and has important phenomenological implications  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we show that the presence of fi term also provides the stabilization mechanisms of the radius modulus field .",
    "let us first see the simplest case where we have no charged matter fields in the theory .",
    "integrating out the fifth - dimensional physics , we find that the presence of the fi term ( [ fi ] ) leads to the potential @xmath44 this vacuum energy depends on the radius @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore determined so that the vacuum energy is minimized .",
    "we find from ( [ vr - uvir ] ) a possibility that the radius is fixed to a finite value @xmath45 the vacuum energy vanishes at this point which is the potential minimum in globally supersymmetric theory .",
    "thus four - dimensional supersymmetry is unbroken while the radius is stabilized .",
    "note that the limit @xmath46 also gives a vanishing vacuum energy , where the low - energy gauge theory becomes a free theory .",
    "however the potential barrier between the two minima can be as high as @xmath47 whose natural size is around the planck scale .",
    "therefore the vacuum ( [ kr ] ) might be made stable within the present age of the universe .",
    "moreover the parameter region far away from the origin could be lifted by supersymmetry breaking which we have not included here .",
    "it is noticed that the existence of the vacuum ( [ kr ] ) calls a restriction on the fi - term coefficients ; @xmath48 .",
    "for example , in case that low - energy theory is anomaly free , we have @xmath42 and hence the radius is not settled at a finite value . for radiatively - generated fi terms , the inequality @xmath49 is realized with ` anomalous ' matter content . then one should assume some anomaly cancellation mechanism that does not affect the fi terms . in this paper",
    ", we do not pursue such a possibility further .",
    "instead we will discuss the radius stabilization with bulk / boundary matter fields in the presence of ` non - anomalous ' fi term : @xmath50 .",
    "in this section we present a scheme for stabilizing the size of warped extra dimension which involves only bulk hypermultiplets . a hypermultiplet which has non - trivial profile of bulk wavefunction connects two localized fi terms , and determines the distance between the boundaries . in this way",
    "the radius is fixed by the equations of motion of bulk fields together with their boundary conditions on the branes .",
    "we consider the five - dimensional @xmath2 gauge theory with non - vanishing boundary fi terms .",
    "its lagrangian is given by ( [ lv ] ) and ( [ lh ] ) as well as boundary superpotentials @xmath51 and @xmath52 for bulk chiral multiplets with even @xmath11 parity .",
    "we do not include any boundary supermultiplets on the branes .",
    "the five - dimensional scalar potential is generally given by @xmath53 the auxiliary fields @xmath18 and @xmath54 s are expressed in terms of bulk scalars through their equations of motion ( see below ) .",
    "here we have simply assumed that the fifth component of the @xmath2 vector field does not have a nonzero expectation value .",
    "the model we present in this section contains two bulk hypermultiplets with the following @xmath2 charges and bulk masses : @xmath55 notice that two hypermultiplets have opposite @xmath2 charges so that they can form a mixing mass term .",
    "this is however just a simplifying assumption .",
    "we will mention other choices of @xmath2 charges in the end of this section and show that the charge assignment of hypermultiplets is irrelevant to the radius stabilization mechanism .",
    "the boundary conditions on the branes , namely , the orbifold parities are taken to be positive for @xmath20 and @xmath56 ( therefore , negative for @xmath21 and @xmath57 ) , which lead to the zero modes of @xmath20 and @xmath56 in low - energy effective theory .",
    "there exists the supersymmetric vacuum in the presence of fi term  ( [ fi ] ) when the bulk scalars take appropriate expectation values so that the flatness conditions are satisfied .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we consider a conceivable case that @xmath50 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we take @xmath58 and then find that among the bulk matter scalars only @xmath11-even @xmath56 develops a vacuum expectation value .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath54 flatness conditions now reduce to @xmath59 , \\label{dflat } \\\\    0 & = & \\big[\\partial_y-\\frac{q}{2}\\sigma     -\\big(\\frac{3}{2}-c_\\varphi\\big)k\\epsilon(y)\\big]\\varphi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the field @xmath60 is the real part of the neutral scalar in the chiral multiplet @xmath17 .",
    "it seems difficult to write down the generic solutions of these vacuum equations but we can analytically solve them for a specific value @xmath61 . in this case , the solutions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the integration constants .",
    "these constants are determined by the boundary fi terms through the @xmath18-term equation  ( [ dflat ] ) as @xmath67 the existence of non - vanishing fi terms therefore fixes the unique supersymmetric vacuum away from the origin of the field space .",
    "when the warp factor is significant ( @xmath68 ) and a fi term is small ( @xmath69 ) , the explicit forms of the integration constants are approximately given by @xmath70 the wavefunctions @xmath62 and @xmath63 do not have singularities between the two boundaries . in the following analysis",
    ", we adopt this value @xmath61 as an example .",
    "it is however stressed that one may expect similar effects of radius stabilization for other generic values of the bulk mass parameters . as we will show below , the only required",
    "is the existence of non - trivial unperturbed solutions .",
    "we introduce the following gauge - invariant superpotential terms onto the boundaries ; @xmath71 it is noted that a supersymmetric mass term between @xmath20 and @xmath56 is forbidden by bulk ads@xmath72 supersymmetry and is forced to be confined on the boundaries , at which bulk supersymmetry is broken to the four - dimensional one .",
    "on the other hand , the mass terms @xmath73 and @xmath74 are allowed to exist by the bulk supersymmetry , but in the present model , the @xmath2 gauge invariance makes it vanish .",
    "therefore ( [ wmass ] ) is the most generic superpotential for the matter fields involved .",
    "as we will see , the above potential terms play important roles of acting as the sources of @xmath20 which , in turn , stabilizes the radius and of lifting the @xmath56 direction from the equation of motion of @xmath20 .",
    "let us first see whether supersymmetry is broken in this model by examining the four - dimensional scalar potential .",
    "the @xmath18-term contribution to the scalar potential is written in the usual form with a non - vanishing fi term .",
    "the @xmath54-term contribution comes from the superpotential obtained by reducing ( [ wmass ] ) to the four - dimensional zero - mode part .",
    "expanding @xmath75 and @xmath76 , it is given by @xmath77 \\phi_4(x)\\varphi_4(x )    \\>\\equiv\\ , m_{\\phi\\varphi}\\,\\phi_4(x)\\varphi_4(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the solutions of their equations of motion .",
    "if the effective mass parameter @xmath80 is nonzero , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are lifted and supersymmetry is broken because the @xmath18-term equation enforces specific values on these fields .",
    "however @xmath80 now depends on the radius @xmath5 , which is generically not a frozen parameter .",
    "the radius @xmath5 thus fixes itself so as to give a vanishing effective mass @xmath80 , for which the vacuum energy is minimized and supersymmetry is restored . in other words , if the radius modulus @xmath6 is included as a dynamical variable , the minimization of scalar potential with respect to @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath6 leads to a vanishing effective mass @xmath80 ( at least local , supersymmetric vacuum ) .",

    "that is , a similar analysis shows that @xmath5 is determined so that @xmath102",
    ".    several comments are in order . at least at this order of perturbation",
    ", the stabilized value of the radius does not seem to depend on the fi term .",
    "it is however noticed that the wavefunction factors @xmath103 s depend on the fi term via @xmath65 .",
    "if one turns off the fi term ( @xmath104 ) , the vacuum goes to the origin of field space , that is , @xmath105 [ see ( [ afix ] ) ] .",
    "consequently , the expectation value of @xmath21 also vanishes which can not lead to the radius determination ( [ rstab ] ) . in this way",
    "the existence of non - vanishing fi term is crucial for the stabilization of radius modulus field .",
    "secondly , as for the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath107 , realizing a significant warp factor does not need any fine tuning .",

    "of course , a radius stabilization with no significant warp factor @xmath113 is easier to be achieved . finally , we comment on the possibility for other choices of @xmath2 charges .",
    "when the bulk mass @xmath114 is exactly one half , the equation ( [ rstab ] ) implies that the radius is not stabilized .",
    "this is however simply because of our @xmath2 charge assignment .",
    "if one supposes the @xmath2 charge of @xmath20 is @xmath115 for example , the gauge - invariant boundary superpotentials take the form @xmath116 . in this case",

    "hence can not fix the radius . in the present case ,",
    "the fi term itself gives rise to a non - vanishing potential .",
    "however it is a monotonous function of @xmath5 and consequently , the radius @xmath5 is fated to have a runaway behavior .",
    "we thus find that , for stabilizing the radius modulus , the fi term must be present and also four - dimensional supersymmetry must be broken ( leading to non - vanishing vacuum energy ) .",
    "an interesting point is that , in curved five - dimensional theory , a fi term is automatically induced and can cause required supersymmetry breaking .",
    "note that the above arguments are applied to the models with boundary multiplets only , and therefore including hypermultiplets and/or bulk dynamics may change the conclusion .",
    "for example , as in the model of section 4 , non - trivial @xmath5-dependences of bulk - field wavefunctions generate @xmath5-dependent ( super)potential terms , which can lead to ( supersymmetric ) radius stabilization .",
    "we have shown in the above that this can not be obtained by boundary matter only and supersymmetry needs to be broken .      as we mentioned , four - dimensional supersymmetry must be broken to stabilize the size of the compact fifth dimension . in the absence of charged matter fields ,",
    "the fi term leads to a non - vanishing potential for the radius modulus , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "however it does not have any minimum with respect to @xmath5 for anomaly - free theory .",
    "moreover it might be unfavorable with such a vacuum energy that supersymmetry is broken at a high - energy scale . in this section ,",
    "we are thus interested in including the charged matter contribution . with a non - vanishing fi term , the @xmath18-flatness condition points to the unique vacuum with nonzero expectation values of charged matter scalars . therefore adding appropriate perturbation to superpotential terms ,",
    "the charged field directions are lifted and hence supersymmetry is broken , as needed .    the most simple case is to introduce on the @xmath9 boundary a vector - like chiral multiplets @xmath32 and @xmath125 ( with @xmath2 charges @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively ) and their mass term : boundary , to introduce only a constant superpotential , and so on .",
    "we find that , in either of these cases , the radius modulus is not stabilized at a finite value . ] @xmath128 together with the @xmath18-term potential , one can see that supersymmetry is broken by small perturbation ( @xmath129 tev ) .",
    "it is however found from ( [ potential ] ) that the modulus potential in this case has the maximum only .",
    "we thus incorporate a constant superpotential on the @xmath28 boundary : @xmath130 .",
    "such a constant superpotential can be obtained in various ways and here we do not consider any details of its origin . without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath131 is taken to be positive and the vacuum is given by @xmath132 the vacuum energy , which depends on the radius @xmath5 , becomes @xmath133 minimizing the vacuum energy determines the value of @xmath5 .",
    "we find the solutions to @xmath134 ; @xmath135 in this vacuum with a stabilized @xmath5 , supersymmetry is broken by nonzero @xmath18 and @xmath54 terms ; @xmath136    there are two typical scales of the constant term @xmath137 such that @xmath138 is on the order of supersymmetry - breaking scale @xmath139 .",
    "the first case is given by a suppressed value of @xmath137 compared to the fundamental scale @xmath140 .",
    "in this case , it is easily found by analyzing the second derivative of the potential that the minimum of @xmath122 is given by @xmath141 . therefore the radius",
    "is stabilized around the value @xmath142 and a large metric warp factor does not arise . the supersymmetry - breaking contribution from the radius modulus is found to be @xmath143 .",

    ", the solution ( [ sol ] ) means that the minimum is around @xmath148 and therefore , @xmath149 as a result , the metric warp factor gives significant effects , and also we have a suppressed value of radius modulus @xmath54 term ; @xmath150 . in fig .",
    "[ vrfig2 ] , we show a typical behavior of the vacuum energy @xmath122 .",
    "( 8,84)@xmath144    the mass of the radius modulus with the proper normalization in this region is @xmath151 again we have a tev - scale massive modulus field . for a large metric factor ,",
    "kk - excited modes have suppressed masses above @xmath152 in four - dimensional theory .",
    "it might require a careful treatment to examine whether the effective lagrangian of zero modes is valid in this parameter region .",
    "in addition , the minimum might not be so steep that it is not meta - stable within the cosmological evolution .",
    "however a higher potential barrier can be achieved by a smaller value of the constant superpotential , and a unstable vacuum is easily avoided .",
    "we have shown that a nonzero fi term can stabilize the radius modulus to a realistic value . as well known in four - dimensional theory ,",
    "the fi term is capable of explaining yukawa hierarchy of quarks and leptons and also of providing interesting sparticle spectrum . in this subsection",
    ", we present a toy model towards constructing realistic theory in higher dimensions where a single existence of fi term has various important implications to phenomenology .",

    "now suppose that @xmath153 comes from a five - dimensional hypermultiplet @xmath157 with orbifold parities @xmath158 .",

    "the charge @xmath25 has been set to + 1 without loss of any generalities .",
    "note that , with only these multiplets at hand , the zero - mode effective @xmath2 theory is anomalous . but some anomaly cancellation may easily be assumed , for example , introducing additional charged multiplets .",
    "an important point here is that , even if effective four - dimensional theory is anomaly free , an induced fi term can be nonzero due to the curved extra dimension .",
    "note also that there are no gauge anomalies for the standard gauge groups , if included , provided that anomalies are cancelled within massless modes  @xcite .",
    "therefore in case that light - mode spectrum is that of the standard model , we do not worry about gauge ( and gravitational ) anomalies for any field configurations in the extra dimension .",
    "the fi term may be radiatively generated even for anomaly - free particle contents .",
    "in the @xmath2 theory above , the one - loop contribution is given by ( [ fi ] ) with @xmath161 and @xmath162 where @xmath163 is near the fundamental scale @xmath119 .",
    "as seen in the previous section , the successful radius stabilization needs a positive value of @xmath41 , which is not satisfied in the present form .",
    "( @xmath40 must also be positive to have yukawa couplings and supersymmetry breaking . ) a simple way to cure this problem is to introduce charged hypermultiplets which have even ( odd ) orbifold parity at the ur ( ir ) boundary , or vice verse .",
    "these additional multiplets contribute to the fi coefficients @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the sum of @xmath2 charges of added multiplets .",
    "moreover they contain no zero modes and do not change the standard model spectrum . with this implementation",
    ", both fi - term coefficients can safely be positive .",
    "in the previous analysis , @xmath123 is replaced with @xmath41 in the solution ( [ sol ] ) and the expressions of the radion mass , but in the expectation values of @xmath125 and @xmath166 , @xmath123 is approximately given by @xmath40 , which is suitably positive if @xmath41 is made positive .",
    "the yukawa couplings for matter multiplets are described by gauge - invariant higher - dimensional operators  @xcite on the @xmath9 boundary : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the @xmath169 coupling constant .",

    "furthermore , in this model , there is an additional possibility to have yukawa suppression unlike in pure four - dimensional theory .",
    "that is a wavefunction factor of bulk hypermultiplet zero modes .",

    "the present setup predicts @xmath178 derived from the background expectation value of @xmath60 , which is fixed by the five - dimensional @xmath18-term equation .",
    "the second term in the bracket is thus tiny in all region of the fifth dimension and can be dropped .",
    "we then find that @xmath175 provides additional suppression of the effective yukawa coupling in the present model .",
    "for @xmath179 , the corresponding zero mode is localized at @xmath9 and yields no suppression of yukawa couplings which come from the operator on the @xmath9 boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath180 case gives a yukawa suppression by the factor @xmath181 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the zero mode is peaked at away from the @xmath9 boundary . in the conformal limit @xmath182 ,",
    "the normalization constant @xmath175 becomes a volume - suppression factor @xmath183 as in the case of flat extra dimension .",
    "supersymmetry - breaking spectrum is related to the radius stabilization and yukawa coupling structure . according to ( [ dff ] ) , there are three types of contributions to supersymmetry - breaking parameters .",

    "the boundary scalars at @xmath9 receive no @xmath190 contribution as seen from the lagrangian ( [ l4d ] ) and have rather different spectrum than those of bulk scalar fields .    in case",

    "the third model involves only boundary dynamics and does not need the presence of bulk matter fields .",
    "the radius is , in this case , determined so that the vacuum energy is minimized after supersymmetry breaking .",
    "every scheme can lead to a significant warp factor or near - flat metric , depending on the model parameters .",
    "it should be noted that , in any model , the fi term is not a device introduced just in order to stabilize the radius modulus . a non - vanishing fi term is radiatively generated even if it is set to be zero at classical level .",
    "an induced fi term depends on how charged matter multiplets are distributed in the extra dimensions and is therefore controllable .",
