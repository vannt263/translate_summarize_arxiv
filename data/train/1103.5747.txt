    "binary systems have long been used to probe both the inner workings and the origins of stars . in multiple systems the laws of gravity can be used to infer the masses of stars .",
    "mass is the fundamental property of any object as this largely determines its entire life history , and thus binaries with direct dynamical mass measurements are important benchmarks for testing theory .",
    "binaries also record within their orbits a dynamical imprint of their formation and subsequent evolution . for a given mass ,",
    "the total energy of the system is related solely to the semimajor axis of the orbit ( @xmath2 ) , while the angular momentum depends on the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "decades before it was known that nucleosynthesis powers stars , well - determined binary orbits were commonplace ( e.g. , @xmath4 orbits were published in the compilation of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and were , for example , used to argue for a dynamical constraint on the age of the galaxy of @xmath5  gyr @xcite as opposed to the @xmath610,000  gyr age limit supported by @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of binary orbits has a rich heritage , predating and defining much of modern astrophysics .",
    "it has only recently been possible to extend such studies below @xmath7 , to masses at the bottom of the main sequence and into the brown dwarf regime .",
    "the field population over this mass range encompasses spectral types @xmath8 , collectively referred to as `` ultracool '' owing to their shared low - temperature atmospheric physics .",
    "only @xmath110  years ago were the first large samples of ultracool dwarfs identified via wide - field surveys such as 2mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , denis , and sdss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the underlying binary population was subsequently uncovered by high - resolution imaging surveys using _ hst _",

    "in the first half of the last decade , orbital monitoring of a few select binaries yielded three dynamical mass measurements : lhs  1070bc ( m8.5+m9.5 ; ) ; gl  569bab ( m8.5+m9 ; @xcite ) ; and 2mass  j0746@xmath92000ab ( l0+l1.5 ; ) .",
    "these first direct mass constraints on ultracool models probed relatively warm temperatures ( @xmath10  k ) and high masses ( only gl  569bb is likely to be a brown dwarf ; @xcite ) .    over just the last three years the number of dynamical masses sufficiently precise for meaningful model tests ( @xmath11 ) has tripled , with components now extending down to masses of @xmath130  @xmath12 and temperatures of @xmath11000  k. this rapid expansion in dynamical masses has been driven by high - precision orbital monitoring programs that utilize the relatively new capability of laser guide star ( lgs ) ao to resolve the shortest period binaries from ground - based telescopes .",

    "the growing sample of ultracool dwarf dynamical masses has enabled some of the strongest tests of theoretical models to date , particularly in the brown dwarf regime . because brown dwarfs do not have a sustained source of internal energy generation",
    ", they simply grow colder and fainter over time .",
    "thus , the sample of field brown dwarfs spans a wide range of masses at a given luminosity , and the only means of pinpointing a given brown dwarf s evolutionary status is to measure its mass or age . as shown by @xcite , fundamental properties such as @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath15@xmath44 better constrained ( i.e.",
    ", model tests are @xmath15@xmath44 stronger ) with dynamical mass measurements as compared to age determinations , which are ordinarily of lower precision .",
    "one of the major components of our work has been to develop an analysis method that produces rigorous , quantitative tests of models based solely on directly measured properties ( i.e. , mass and luminosity ) .",
    "this is of fundamental importance , as other previous approaches were sometimes based on @xmath42 estimates or the model - predicted color  magnitude diagram , both of which are often prone to severe systematic biases ( e.g. , see discussions in @xcite and section  4.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancies we have found between observations and models to date fall into two categories : ( 1 )  problems with the luminosities predicted by evolutionary models , ( 2 )  problems with temperature estimates derived from model atmospheres and/or from evolutionary model radii .",
    "conventional wisdom is that the most robust predictions of substellar models are bulk properties such as the radius and bolometric luminosity ( @xmath45 ) since independent models put forth by different groups produce nearly identical ( to within a few percent ) values at ages beyond a few myr .",
    "consequently , evolutionary models have become trusted to provide accurate mass estimates in the many situations when luminosity and age are well constrained , such as cluster mass functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and directly imaged extrasolar planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , until recently no direct measurements of luminosity and mass were available for any brown dwarfs that also had well determined ages .    the first , and to date only , system that enables a direct test of substellar luminosity evolution is the l4+l4 binary hd  130948bc @xcite .",
    "its model - derived age ( given its measured total mass and component luminosities ) is significantly younger than the age of the primary g2v star in this triple system .",
    "this is a 2@xmath46 discrepancy when accounting for the errors in the binary s measured mass and luminosities and the gyrochronology relation used to age - date the primary star @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the stellar age and its error are correct ( i.e. , hd  130948a is not simply an outlier as compared to the cluster rotation sequences ) , then the luminosities predicted by evolutionary models for hd  130948b and c are a factor of @xmath12 lower than what is observed . in considering this potential luminosity problem , we will now address the following questions : ( 1 )  is there additional evidence for models underpredicting luminosities of substellar objects ; and ( 2 )  what physical mechanism could be responsible for this effect ?    _ ( 1 )  is there additional evidence for the luminosity problem ?",
    "_ if models underpredict luminosities , this would manifest as either model - derived masses ( based on @xmath45 and age ) that are @xmath125% too high or model - derived ages ( based on mass and @xmath45 ) that are too young .",
    "the former problem can be tested in the multiple planet system around hr  8799 .",
    "@xcite have shown that there only two plausible scenarios for the three tightly packed , massive planets ( model - derived masses of 7 , 10 , and 10  @xmath12 ) to be dynamically stable : ( 1 )  the inner planets must be in 2:1 resonance , and all three planets must have masses lower than predicted by models by at least 20%30% ; or ( 2 )  both the inner pair and outer pair of planets must be in 2:1 resonances , in which case the masses of the planets could be as much as a factor of @xmath62 larger . the careful construction of the system required in the latter case may suggest that the first scenario is in fact more plausible , and the `` luminosity problem '' may also be seen here .    further evidence for the luminosity problem can also come from objects with model - derived ages that appear to be too young . @xcite",
    "have observed this in the m7.5+m8 binary lp  349 - 25ab for which lyon models give an age of @xmath47  myr .",
    "this is essentially identical to the canonical pleiades age of 125  myr as determined from the lithium depletion boundary independent of model luminosity predictions @xcite .",
    "however , lp  349 - 25ab appears to be significantly older than the pleiades given the strong upper limit on its abundance @xcite , and it also does not show spectroscopic signatures of youth as is normally seen in young ( @xmath6100  myr ) field dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ ( 2 )  what physical mechanisms could explain the luminosity problem ? _ after a few myr of evolution , model cooling tracks that adopt very different initial conditions converge to essentially the same luminosity , so accounting for different formation histories such as in `` cold start '' models with radiative energy losses due to accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will not alter model cooling tracks sufficiently to explain our observed luminosity discrepancy .",
    "rather , it is more likely that a process sustained over these objects lifetimes , such as convection , is responsible for the problem . @xcite",
    "have recently constructed evolutionary models tailored to the components of hd  130948bc in which the onset of convection is inhibited by very strong magnetic fields throughout the interior .",
    "this effect can substantially alter the radius evolution of the components of hd  130948bc and thus explain the observed discrepancy on the h - r diagram reported by @xcite because their new models yield larger radii , which shifts model tracks to lower @xmath42 . however , at the same time these models also _ lower _ the model - predicted luminosities by @xmath10.2  dex ( @xmath150% ) , increasing the observed luminosity discrepancy",
    ".    if the inhibition of the onset of convection has the opposite effect on the luminosity evolution , then perhaps the efficiency of convection must be changed .",
    "consider the impact of strong interior magnetic fields and fast rotation on the convective energy transport in low - mass stars .",
    "they find that these processes result in lowered convective efficiency , which in turn results in bloated radii for @xmath10.30.8  @xmath48 stars , while lower mass fully convective stars are much less affected .",
    "the effect of reduced convective energy transport for brown dwarfs is not investigated in detail , but point out that its main effect will be to slow their contraction rate .",
    "this may effectively `` slow down the clock '' of substellar evolution , i.e. , for a given mass and age objects would be larger and more luminous than predicted by conventional evolutionary models that do not include the effects of convective inhibition due to rotation or strong interior magnetic fields .",
    "model atmospheres offer the possibility of determining the temperature and surface gravity of an object from a single spectrum .",
    "this approach is widely used in the study of very low - mass stars , brown dwarfs , and directly imaged planets .",
    "however , the reliability of such estimates ( and the conclusions drawn from them ) depend entirely the fidelity of the model atmospheres being used .",
    "this can only be assessed in special cases where independent constraints on the mass , age , or radius are available .",
    "we have utilized our measured dynamical masses of ultracool field dwarfs to provide some of the strongest tests of model atmospheres to date .",
    "this is made possible by the fact that direct mass measurements effectively pin down the evolutionary status of a field object to a degree of certainty commensurate with the precision of the measured mass and luminosity ( both typically @xmath49 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 then inferred from evolutionary models are limited to a very narrow range , typically exceeding the precision of the model atmosphere grid steps of 50100  k and 0.5  dex .",
    "this evolutionary model - derived @xmath42 is essentially a restatement of the model radius given the measured luminosity , following the definition of effective temperature , @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , these binaries provide precise temperature benchmarks that can be compared to results from model atmosphere fitting .",
    "we have found that temperatures derived from model atmospheres are typically inconsistent with those from evolutionary models at the level of @xmath1100300  k. the amplitude and the sign of this disagreement vary over the full range of our sample .",
    "for example , t  dwarf model atmosphere fits give @xmath1100200  k warmer temperatures than evolutionary model radii @xcite , but l  dwarf model atmosphere fits give @xmath1200300  k cooler temperatures @xcite .",
    "the lack of a systematic offset for all objects indicates that the disagreement is not simply due to a uniform error in predicted radii at all masses and spectral types , but without directly measured radii , which would provide @xmath42  directly , it is impossible to distinguish whether evolutionary or atmospheric models are responsible for the observed discrepancies .",
    "if we restrict our comparisons to a narrow range of temperatures , we can essentially remove one variable from the problem and focus on how the @xmath42 discrepancies vary with mass and age . to date , the largest subset of mass benchmarks at any given temperature are the late - m dwarfs ( table  1 ) .",
    "we obtained integrated - light near - infrared spectroscopy of four nearly equal - flux late - m binaries with component mass determinations ranging from @xmath10.060.10  @xmath48 ( i.e. , young brown dwarfs to old stars ) and with a range of chromospheric activity levels @xcite . after fitting these spectra with four independent model atmosphere grids",
    ", we found that all best - fit temperatures were systematically @xmath1250  k warmer than the @xmath42 values derived from evolutionary models ( figure  2 ) .",
    "thus , the observed @xmath42 discrepancy is the same for objects with very similar spectra but with very different masses , ages , and activity levels , indicating that the model atmospheres are largely responsible for the observed @xmath42 discrepancy .",
    "some properties of very low - mass binaries , such as orbital semimajor axes , mass ratios , and multiplicity fractions , can be studied in a statistical fashion using a large sample without any knowledge of orbital motion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such studies have provided very important constraints on formation models at very low masses . however , only well - determined orbits can provide eccentricities ( @xmath51 ) , which are directly related to the angular momentum of the formation process .",
    "in fact , the only two theoretical simulations that report eccentricities of very low - mass binaries predict very different types of orbits : ( 1 )  the cluster formation model of @xcite yields a total of 16 binaries with typically modest eccentricities , and ( 2 )  the disk gravitational instability model of @xcite produces 12 binaries with typically high eccentricities ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the sample of very low - mass binaries with well - determined orbits is now of comparable size to the binaries produced in theoretical simulations , and thus it can be used to try to discriminate between the very different model predictions .",
    "figure  3 shows the eccentricity distribution for all very low - mass binaries with eccentricity uncertainties less than 0.1 .",
    "this excludes the visual binary 2mass  j1534@xmath292952ab ( table  1 ) and includes three spectroscopic binaries : ppl  15 ( @xmath52 ; @xcite ) , 2mass  j0535@xmath290546 ( @xmath53 ; @xcite ) , and 2mass  j0320@xmath290446 ( @xmath54 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this sample populates a broad range in eccentricity from nearly circular to highly eccentric ( @xmath51 = 0.030.83 ) and shows a strong preference for modest eccentricities ( @xmath55 , median of 0.32 ) .",
    "the observed distribution of eccentricities is well - matched to that predicted by the cluster formation model of @xcite , although we note that this simulation is not in full agreement with observations as it produces much wider binaries than are observed in the field .",
    "in contrast , the gravitational instability model of @xcite produces too many high-@xmath51 binaries , with an absence of _ any _ modest eccentricity ( @xmath56 ) orbits , which is highly inconsistent with the observed distribution ."
