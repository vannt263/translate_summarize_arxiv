    "studies of anisotropy of cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies around 1  eev ( @xmath0  ev ) have a long and fascinating history . the first results date back to early 1960 s  @xcite but an intensive work is still in progress in both theoretical and experimental directions . in recent years , the pierre auger observatory and the telescope array project performed a great amount of sophisticated studies of anisotropy of ultra - high energy crs , and some of them were dedicated to eev energies .",
    "the studies were mostly performed in two directions : ( i )  large - scale anisotropy , such as an analysis of dipole and quadrupole anisotropy , and ( ii )  small - scale anisotropy , namely searches for point sources of neutrons or photons ( regions with radius @xmath1 ) .",
    "no significant deviation from isotropy was revealed at large scales within the systematic uncertainties , and no point sources were found , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "some studies have also been performed at intermediate angular scales . in 2005",
    ", a region around the galactic center ( gc ) was analyzed in the energy range 1.02.5  eev with smoothing at an angular scale of @xmath2 and at energies 0.83.2  eev at @xmath3 ( and a small scale of @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath5 band around the galactic plane ( gp ) was studied in the energy range 15  eev with smoothing on a  @xmath6 scale . a blind search for localized excess fluxes in the whole field of view ( fov ) of the auger experiment",
    "was performed in two energy bands above 1  eev ( 15  eev and @xmath7  eev ) at angular scales of @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the study employed 29073 events in the lower energy band .    in 2007 ,",
    "the anisotropy studies around the gc were updated with increased statistics  @xcite .",
    "anisotropy of arrival directions of events in the energy range 0.973.16  eev was studied using circular windows of  @xmath10 .",
    "the direction to the gc was also studied at energies in the ranges 0.11  eev and 110  eev for windows sizes of @xmath6 and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the latest results of a blind search for localized excesses in four energy ranges above 1  eev in circular windows of angular radius of @xmath8 and @xmath9 over the full exposed sky were presented in  @xcite .",
    "all these studies gave results compatible with isotropy .",
    "the only exception was a result of 2011  @xcite , when a region around the gc was studied with circular cells of radii extending from  @xmath12 to  @xmath11 in the energy range 0.63.8  eev , and an excess was found at an  @xmath13 scale for energies above 0.9  eev .",
    "the excess was only observable in winter months though and was concluded to be due to seasonal effects .",
    "the telescope array collaboration studied anisotropy of events with energies 12.5  eev and 0.71.8  eev registered with the surface detector  @xcite .",
    "the event density map was averaged over the circles of @xmath11 radius centered on the @xmath14 grid .",
    "no significant deviations from isotropy were found .",

    "conversely , the flux does not deviate from the background at this location in the he data set .",
    "figure  [ fig : r16r20 ] shows maps of anisotropy obtained for circular windows of radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it can be seen that the picture becomes closer to what is expected for isotropy at large scales as  @xmath23 grows .",

    "only region  d remains in the other data sets for @xmath16 with the li  ma significance decreasing . for @xmath17 , @xmath25 for region  d in the main data set ( on the shuffled background ) and only marginally exceeds  3 for the le set .",
    "a recent study of the large - scale distribution of crs around 1  eev performed by the pierre auger collaboration revealed that while it does not contradict isotropy , declination and right ascension of the dipole for the 12  eev energy band are @xmath26 , @xmath27 with uncertainty @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the direction correlates with region  d and its counterpart in the he set .",
    "this allows one to suggest that region  d is somehow related to the dipole anisotropy in this energy range .",

    "[ fig : r8r12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : r16r20 ] how some of the separate regions with an excess or deficit of cosmic rays concatenate as the angular scale of the analysis increases .",
    "it is especially clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : r16r20 ] how different are the `` patterns '' of anisotropy for the le and he data sets even though they do not significantly deviate from isotropy .",
    "the presented results demonstrate that anisotropy of cosmic rays with energies around 1  eev might have interesting features at certain intermediate angular scales , including localized regions of excess , and that anisotropy evolves with energy .",
    "still , the study has a serious limitation because of the small amount of data used .",
    "on the one hand , calculations performed with other available data reveal that a sample consisting of just one or a few percent of the whole data set only partially reproduces anisotropy of the whole set , and significant differences are possible . on the other hand , such limited data sets as those studied",
    "do not allow one to apply more advanced methods of analysis .",
    "in particular , it is hardly possible to accurately estimate the dipole anisotropy and to take it into account when studying anisotropy at intermediate scales . in our opinion",
    ", it would be interesting if an analysis of anisotropy of cosmic rays around 1  eev at intermediate angular scales is performed with full data sets of the auger and telescope array experiments .",
    "it can provide information concerning the structure of the galactic magnetic field and the fundamental problem of the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays .",
