    "it is evident that quantum information processes such as quantum teleportation@xcite , quantum cryptography@xcite , and quantum computer@xcite will play crucial role in the future technology . in this reason , much attention is paid , recently , to the quantum entanglement@xcite because it is regarded as a genuine physical resource for the quantum information processing .",
    "although research into the quantum entanglement has a long history@xcite , the study of its properties in the relativistic setting was initiated recently@xcite .",
    "the main issue in this subject is to understand how a given entanglement is changed in the inertial-@xcite and non - inertial-@xcite frames . in the non - inertial frame degradation of the entanglement",
    "occurs , which is related to the well - known unruh effect@xcite .",
    "more recently , moreover , the change of the entanglement in the black hole background was also examined@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , braneworld scenario@xcite , one of the modern cosmology , assumes that our @xmath2 spacetime universe is embedded in higher - dimensional world . in this reason , the absorption and emission properties of the higher - dimensional black holes",
    "were investigated few years ago@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the degradation of the bipartite entanglement in the presence of the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole . in order to explore the degradation we assume that alice and rob share the maximally entangled state initially . after sharing rob moves to the near - horizon region while alice is free falling into the black hole . in this situation",
    "we will compute the entanglement by adopting the negativity@xcite as an entanglement measure .",
    "our main focus in this paper is to investigate the effect of the extra dimensions @xmath1 in the entanglement degradation . of course ,",
    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is reproduced when @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the spacetime geometry of the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole . for later convenience",
    "we compare the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild spacetime with the rindler spacetime in this section .",
    "this comparison enables us to transform our problem into the degradation of entanglement in the non - inertial frame , which was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "iii we discuss on the @xmath1-dependence of the entanglement .",
    "the correlation between alice and rob is generally degraded in the presence of the black hole .",
    "it is found that the degradation becomes weaker and weaker with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "for the case between rob and antirob the quantum correlation , contrary to the physically accessible correlation , decreases with increasing @xmath1 . in section",
    "iv a brief conclusion is given . in appendix a explicit computation of negativity is performed .",
    "the higher - dimensional black hole solutions of the einstein field equation were discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the explicit expression of the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole solution in terms of the usual schwarzschild coordinates is in the following : @xmath4 where @xmath5 the horizon radius @xmath6 is related to the black hole mass @xmath7 as following : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a @xmath0-dimensional planck mass and @xmath10 is a newton constant .",
    "because of the symmetry of the problem we restrict our attention to the temporal and radial coordinates .",
    "thus , the part of the metric we will analyze is @xmath11 we can write the line - element @xmath12 in terms of the proper time @xmath13 of an observer located in @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "now , we define a new spatial coordinate @xmath18 as follows : @xmath19 then , the profile function @xmath20 can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a surface gravity defined by @xmath23 in terms of @xmath18 it is easy to show that the line - element @xmath24 becomes @xmath25^{(1-n ) / ( 1+n ) } dz^2.\\ ] ] in the near - horizon region , _ i.e. _ @xmath26 , eq . ( [ metric4 ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath27 this is just the metric of the rindler space with the acceleration parameter @xmath28 .    in order to discuss on the physical states we define the kruskal coordinates",
    "@xmath29 where the `` tortoise '' coordinate @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 in terms of the kruskal coordinates the line - element @xmath24 becomes @xmath32 since @xmath30 reduces to @xmath33 at the near - horizon region , we can re - express @xmath24 in this region as @xmath34 as authors in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested , there are three regions in this background , in which we can define the different time - like killing vectors .",
    "thus , one should define the physical vacuum in each region .",
    "first vacuum is known as the hartle - hawking vacuum @xmath35 .",
    "this is defined by the time - like killing vector which is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "second and third vacua are the boulware vacuum@xcite @xmath37 and anti - boulware vacuum @xmath38 , which are defined by the time - like killing vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "since the metric ( [ metric5 ] ) reduces to the rindler space metric with the acceleration @xmath28 in the near - horizon region , one can derive the interrelations between these vacua using the unruh effect@xcite .",
    "the relations beyond the single - mode approximation were derived in ref .",
    "corresponding @xmath35 to minkowski vacuum and , @xmath37 and @xmath38 to the vacua in the left- and right - wedges of rindler space , one can derive the following relations : @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ inter1 ] ) @xmath44 means @xmath45-particle states of energy @xmath46 , which is constructed by operating the creation operator @xmath45 times to the vacuum @xmath47 with @xmath48 . in next section",
    "we will use eq .",
    "( [ inter1 ] ) to analyze the bosonic entanglement degradation in the presence of the black hole ( [ schwarz1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider a situation that alice and rob initially share the maximally entangled state@xmath49 when both are free falling into the black hole . since @xmath36 is proportional to the time - like killing vector for the free falling observer , eq .",
    "( [ maximal ] ) is understood to be written as a hartle - hawking basis . for simplicity ,",
    "the energy parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 for alice and rob are ignored in eq .",
    "( [ maximal ] ) .",
    "now , we assume that after sharing @xmath52 , rob moves to the near - horizon region , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves into @xmath54 throughout this paper . therefore , eq . ( [ acceleration1 ] ) implies @xmath55 where @xmath56 . in this assumption eq .",
    "( [ inter1 ] ) implies that @xmath52 is changed into @xmath57.\\ ] ]    in this paper our main interest is to examine the effect of the extra dimension @xmath1 in the entanglement degradation .",
    "thus , we will choose @xmath58 for simplicity . furthermore ,",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ inter1 ] ) with @xmath58 case corresponds to the unruh transformation within the single - mode approximation .",
    "now , let us discuss on the entanglement between alice and rob .",
    "in order to examine the entanglement in the presence of the @xmath0-dimensional black hole , we should compute the bipartite entanglement of a quantum state @xmath59 , where the subscript @xmath60 stands for alice and rob .",
    "although there are a lot of entanglement measures which quantify the bipartite entanglement such as entanglement of formation@xcite , concurrence@xcite , and relative entropy of entanglement@xcite , most of them are very hard to compute mainly due to that fact that @xmath59 is a state in qudit system .",
    "therefore , we choose a negativity@xcite in this paper for tractable computation .",
    "the negativity @xmath61 of @xmath59 is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the eigenvalues of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a partial transposition with respect to the party @xmath66 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the negativity @xmath61 in the absence of the black hole is @xmath67 .",

    "1 we plot @xmath61 with varying the number of extra dimensions as @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) we plot the @xmath71-dependence of @xmath61 with choosing @xmath69 . as this figure exhibits , @xmath61 is less than @xmath73 , so that as expected , the degradation of the entanglement occurs .",
    "the rate of the degradation decreases with increasing @xmath71 , which means that rob goes away from the black hole . when rob approaches to the horizon , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath74 , all bipartite entanglement vanishes .",
    "another remarkable fact this figure shows is that the degradation becomes weaker with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this fact can be explained as follows . in @xmath0 dimension",
    "the newtonian gravitational force is proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , it goes weaker and weaker with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the effective acceleration rob needs to remain outside the black hole becomes smaller with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "it causes the weaker degradation of the entanglement between alice and rob . in fig .",
    "1(b ) we plot the @xmath46-dependence of @xmath61 with choosing @xmath72 .",
    "this figure also shows that the degradation becomes weaker with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the reason for this fact can be explained same way .",
    "the computation of negativity between alice and antirob is given in appendix a. it is shown that no entanglement is created between these parties when @xmath58 , which corresponds to the unruh transformation within the single - mode approximation .",

    "contrary to the quantum correlation between alice and rob the quantum entanglement between rob and antirob decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "we do not know why @xmath1-dependence of @xmath76 is different from that of @xmath61 .",
    "probably , this is due to the fact that this entanglement is unphysical because rob is causally disconnected fro antirob .",
    "thus , this quantum correlation is purely theoretical and is useless for the quantum information task .",
    "in this short paper we compute the various bipartite quantum correlations in the presence of the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black hole .",
    "in particular , we focus on the @xmath1-dependence of the bosonic entanglements . for the case between alice and",

    "the entanglement is found to decrease with decreasing @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we performed the calculation under the condition of @xmath80 .",
    "if we relax this condition , various correlations may exhibit different behavior . in this case , however , we can not use the rindler - anology of the schwarzschild background .",
    "thus we have to re - derive the equations corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ inter1 ] ) in this case by computing appropriate bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "however , this generalization might be difficult problem mainly due to the difficulty in the analytic computation of the bogoliubov coefficients .",
