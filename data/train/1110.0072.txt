    "this is the second paper in the series of papers where we discuss pointer states of measurement and their evaluation .",
    "we refer to this paper as paper @xmath3 in this series of papers .",
    "in this paper we study a spin - boson model which is defined through the following total hamiltonian @xmath4 this model basically is composed of a central spin - half particle ( or other two - level system ) surrounded by an environment of @xmath5 bosonic particles such as photons . in the hamiltonian of the spin - boson model , represented by equation ( [ 1 ] ) , we have considered an intrinsic tunneling contribution in the self - hamiltonian of the system ( proportional to the @xmath6 pauli matrix ) , which can induce intrinsic transitions between the upper and lower states of the central system . here",
    "@xmath7 is the so - called tunneling matrix element .",
    "also , it is assumed that the asymmetry energy in the self - hamiltonian of the central system is negligible .",
    "therefore , here we do not consider a contribution proportional to the @xmath8 pauli matrix in the self - hamiltonian of the system . ) . ] the second term in equation ( [ 1 ] ) represents the self - hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field ; where we have considered a single - mode quantized field with the frequency of @xmath9 for the environment .",
    "also the third term , with @xmath10 as the spin - field coupling constant , represents the interaction between the central spin - half particle and a single - mode quantized field ; which in fact is the quantized form of the famous @xmath11 hamiltonian due to the interaction between a particle of magnetic dipole - moment @xmath12 and a magnetic field @xmath13 .    in the paper by leggett _",
    "@xcite they considered a general form of the hamiltonian given by equation ( [ 1 ] ) , where the environment can be represented by a spectral density * * _ j_**@xmath14 ( rather than considering a _ single - mode _ quantized field ) .",
    "they used the  influence - functional \" method of feynman and vernon @xcite to obtain general expressions for @xmath15 in the form of a power series in @xmath16 .",
    "however , the general expressions they obtained for @xmath17 in terms of the spectral density function * * _ j_**@xmath14 were exceedingly cumbersome to calculate in most regimes .",
    "so , they assumed @xcite .",
    "the model represented by the hamiltonian of equation ( [ 1 ] ) can also be studied in the framework of the born - markov approximation in order to obtain an approximate master equation for the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system @xcite .",
    "the master equations obtained in this way are valid only in certain regimes ; and moreover , one often may need to resort to numerical computation in order to be able to solve them . however , the main purpose of this paper is ( 1 ) to obtain the time - dependent pointer states of the system and the environment , as well as expressions for the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system in the exact resonance regime and for an environment initially prepared in the coherent state ; and ( 2 ) to obtain approximate expressions _ in closed form _ for the evolution of the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix ( for the case that the environment initially is prepared in a coherent state with a large average number of photons ) , which can be used study the decoherence of the central system _ in an analytical way_.    now consider a two - state system @xmath18 with two arbitrary basis states @xmath19 and @xmath20 , initially prepared in the state @xmath21 s are a complete set of basis states for the environment . where the @xmath22 s are some generally _ time - dependent _ operators in the hilbert space of the environment , and depend on the total hamiltonian defining the system - environment model .",
    "using equations ( 2 ) to ( 4 ) we can write the global state of the system and the environment as @xmath23 now , for the global state of the system and the environment , given by equation ( [ 3.29 ] ) , we observe that _ if _ for some initial states of the system and the environment the two vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the hilbert space of the environment turn out to be parallel with each other , i.e.  if @xmath26 with @xmath27 as a scalar which generally may depend on time , then those initial states of the system and the environment will not entangle with each other , and hence they can represent the initial pointer states of the system and the environment .",
    "in fact , if for some initial states of the system and the environment the condition represented by equation ( [ 3.30.1 ] ) is satisfied , the global state of the system and the environment ( equation ( [ 3.29 ] ) ) can be written in a product from as @xmath28 in which case pointer states can be realized for the system and the environment given by @xmath29 and those of the environment by @xmath30 .",
    "also , @xmath31 is the normalization factor for the pointer states of the system .",
    "in general , an arbitrary choice of @xmath32 s will not necessarily yield an @xmath33 pair that remain parallel for any choice of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; therefore an arbitrary choice of @xmath32 s does not necessarily correspond to a pointer state for the environment .",
    "nonetheless , for a given set of @xmath32 s there may exist two sets of complex numbers for @xmath34 and @xmath35 with two corresponding values for the scalar function @xmath27 such that equation ( [ 3.30.1 ] ) is satisfied . in the following example , we show that for an assumed set of @xmath32 s , values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 exist such that equation ( [ 3.30.1 ] ) is approximately satisfied in the limit of large number of degrees of freedom for the environment . )",
    "we notice that in practice we can expect some states of the system and the environment to keep their individuality and not to entangle with each other _ even _ if they can satisfy our condition ( given by equation ( [ 3.30.1 ] ) ) only in a fraction of the hilbert space of the environment where the @xmath32 coefficients are not negligible .",
    "this of course will involve assuming some approximations in obtaining pointer states . however , as we will show in this paper ,",
    "in the end we can define a measure for the degree of entanglement between the states of the system and the environment , which after its calculation for the pointer states which we obtain for our model we can know exactly in which regimes our pointer states are valid and will not entangle with the states of another system .",
    "for example , this way we will show in this paper that the pointer states which we will obtain for our spin - boson model for an environment initially prepared in the coherent state are valid ( i.e.  will not entangle with the states of any other subsystem throughout their evolution with time ) up to times of the order @xmath36 ; where @xmath2 is the average number of photons in the coherent state of the environment . ]",
    "in order to calculate the time - evolution operator in the interaction picture for the hamiltonian given by equation ( [ 1 ] ) , first we need to have the corresponding hamiltonian in the interaction picture .",
    "it can @xmath37 here , the commutator of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e.  @xmath40 $ ] with @xmath38 given by equation ( [ 6 ] ) , is not a function of a constant number .",
    "this in fact can make the evaluation of the time - evolution operator quite difficult @xcite .",
    "in parallel with paper @xmath41 we consider the general form given by equation ( [ 270 ] ) for the evolution operator of the global spin - field system . for such time - evolution operator in the interaction picture ,",
    "which satisfies the schrdinger equation @xmath42 we have @xmath43    now , we assume the transition matrix element @xmath7 to be in resonance with the cavity eigenmode @xmath9 and we use the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite ( just as is assumed in the conventional jaynes - cummings model of quantum optics @xcite ) .",
    "so , by entering the resonance condition @xmath44 and using the rotating wave approximation ( i.e.  disregarding the higher - frequency terms which contain @xmath45 ) the above equation will simplify to the following set of four equations @xmath46    in order to solve the above set of coupled differential equations , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we take a derivative with respect to time of the first equation . by replacing @xmath47 and @xmath48 from the first and the third equations in the resulting equation we find @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number operator .",
    "similarly , by doing the same procedure on the third equation for @xmath48 we find @xmath51 next , we define @xmath52 and @xmath53 as follows @xmath54 by adding and subtracting equations ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) we find @xmath55 these equations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 can simply be solved to find @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are some time - independent _ operators _ ( rather than constant _ numbers _ ) , which will be found from our initial conditions in the following paragraphs . here",
    "we note that since these coefficients generally are some time - independent operators rather than constant numbers , and they do not necessarily commute with the number operator @xmath61 , we _ must _ have them on the right - hand side of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 functions ( rather than having them on the left - hand side ) . only in this way the solutions in equation ( [ 15 ] ) will satisfy equation ( [ 14 ] ) .    now using equations ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) , we can obtain the operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 as follows : @xmath66 in quite the same manner we can calculate @xmath67 and @xmath68 as follows @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 also , generally are some time - independent _ operators _ , which will be determined from our original set of equations ( [ 10 ] ) and the initial conditions on @xmath74 s .    in order to obtain the eight operator coefficients which appear in our expressions for @xmath74 s , first we note that the time - evolution operator , given by equation ( [ 270 ] ) , must satisfy the initial condition @xmath75 ; where @xmath76 represents the identity operator in the hilbert space of the system and @xmath77 is the identity operator in the hilbert space of the environment .",
    "this means that we must have @xmath78 from the above initial conditions and equations ( [ 16 ] ) to ( 21 ) we easily find four of the coefficients as follows @xmath79 in order to find @xmath57 and @xmath58 we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we use equation ( [ 10]-a ) to obtain @xmath65 as follows @xmath80 replacing @xmath64 and @xmath47 from equation ( [ 16 ] ) into the above equation , it reads @xmath81 at @xmath82 the above equation reduces to @xmath83 operating this last equation on @xmath84 we have @xmath85 next , we use equation ( [ 10]-c ) to obtain @xmath64 as follows @xmath86 replacing @xmath65 and @xmath48 from equation ( 19 ) into the above equation , it reads @xmath87 at @xmath82 the above equation reduces to @xmath88 operating this last equation on @xmath84 we have @xmath89 finally , we use equations ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) to obtain the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 . assuming @xmath10 to be real and then adding equations ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) we find @xmath90 comparing the above equation to @xmath91 we find @xmath57 as @xmath92 similarly , by subtracting equation ( [ 29 ] ) from equation ( [ 25 ] ) to find @xmath93 and comparing the above equation to @xmath94 we find @xmath58 as @xmath95 one should pay attention to the order that the operators appear in equations ( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) ; as they are not commuting operators .    by doing exactly the same procedure on equations ( [ 10]-b ) and ( [ 10]-d ) we would find the operator coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 as follows @xmath96 now that we found all the operator coefficients",
    ", we can replace them back in equations ( [ 16 ] ) to ( 20 ) and write the @xmath74 in their final form @xmath97 @xmath98 one can verify that the above set of operators satisfy the unitarity of the time - evolution operator @xmath99 .",
    "in order to obtain the time - dependent pointer states of the system and those of its environment for our model , represented by the hamiltonian of equation ( [ 1 ] ) , we assume the field to be initially prepared in the coherent state @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the average number of photons in the coherent state , and @xmath103 . in this section we will show that in the regime that we are considering ( i.e.  the exact - resonance regime ) and for the environment initially prepared in the coherent state , in the limit of a large average number of photons @xmath104 we must have pointer states for the system ( the central spin ) given by @xmath105 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are eigenstates of the @xmath8 pauli matrix .",
    "we make the usual assumption that there exists no correlations between the system and the environment at @xmath82 .",
    "so , we consider the following initial state for the total composite system @xmath106 for the @xmath74 , given by equations ( 36 ) through ( 39 ) , we can write @xmath107 where @xmath108 s ( with @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) are given by @xmath111 using equation ( [ 52 ] ) our condition , given by equation ( [ 51 ] ) , becomes @xmath112    , since the number states @xmath113 are a complete set of basis states for the environment , for the initial pointer states we can open the summations in equation ( [ 54 ] ) and equalize terms from the two sides of this equation which correspond to the same number state @xmath84 . after using equation ( [ 53 ] ) ,",
    "equation ( [ 54 ] ) would simplify as the above result for @xmath27 , which generally depends on @xmath114 , would contradict our initial assumption of , _ unless _ we can find certain initial states for the system for which @xmath27 turns out to become independent of @xmath114 ; since as we discussed , for pointer states all components of the vector @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) must be related to their corresponding components from @xmath13 ( @xmath117 ) through the _ same _ scalar factor @xmath118 ( see equation ( 6 ) ) .",
    "so now we should seek for those particular initial states of the system which can make @xmath27 independent of the index @xmath114 of the states of the environment .",
    "for an initial coherent field ( equation ( [ 48 ] ) ) we have : + @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , in the limit of a large average number of photons @xmath104 we can replace the factors @xmath121 and @xmath122 by unity ; since for @xmath104 the poisson distribution of the coherent field is extremely sharp ( with @xmath2 at the center ) and hence , for @xmath104 and @xmath123 we have @xmath124 and @xmath125 , while for @xmath114 being far from @xmath2 the @xmath32 coefficient is negligible .",
    "so , the corresponding terms ( of @xmath114 being far from @xmath2 ) do not have any contribution in the summations of equation ( [ 54 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "equation ( [ 56 ] ) for @xmath27 can be further simplified to @xmath126 replacing the @xmath127 functions from equation ( [ 53 ] ) , the above equation reads @xmath128{0.98,0.00,0.00}{(\\alpha+\\beta)e^{-i\\varphi}}\\cos({\\mathrm{g}}t\\sqrt{n+1})-i\\textcolor[rgb]{0.98,0.00,0.00}{(\\alpha-\\beta)}\\sin({\\mathrm{g}}t\\sqrt{n+1 } ) \\\\",

    "we show that for @xmath129 , which is equivalent to the initial conditions for the state of the system given by @xmath130 @xmath27 of equation ( [ 58 ] ) will be independent of the states of the environment ; provided we have a large average number of photons in the field @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , the initial conditions of equation ( [ 59 ] ) correspond to the initial states of the system which do not entangle with the states of the environment .",
    "after that , we will obtain the time evolution of these initial pointer states and followed by that we obtain the corresponding pointer states of the environment .",
    "for @xmath129 the expression in equation ( [ 58 ] ) for @xmath27 simplifies to @xmath131 the above expression can be written as @xmath132 from the taylor series expansion of @xmath133 about @xmath2 ( the average number of photons in the environment ) , given by @xmath134 we notice that in the limit of a very large average number of photons we can replace @xmath133 by @xmath135 @xcite ; since for very large @xmath2 all terms containing the index @xmath114 , which appear after the first term , are negligible ; and _ the series is convergent_. so , in the classical limit of @xmath104 we can rewrite equation ( [ 61 ] ) for @xmath27 as @xmath136 which clearly is independent of the index @xmath114 of the states of the environment .    in appendix",
    "a by calculating the degree of entanglement between the states of the system and the environment for the pointer states which will be obtained from the above result , we will show that this result is valid over a length of time which is proportional to @xmath2 , the average number of photons in the field .",
    "the result of equation ( [ 62 ] ) ) simply means that for the initial states of the system given by @xmath137 the states of the system and the environment will not entangle with each other .",
    "moreover , using equation ( [ 3.32 ] ) which gives us the general time evolution of the pointer states of the system ; and @xmath27 of equation ( [ 62 ] ) ( which is independent of the index @xmath114 of the states of the environment ) we can find the time evolution of the pointer states of the system as follows @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the normalization factors for the @xmath140 and @xmath141 states respectively .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath142 so , we can rewrite equation ( [ 64 ] ) as @xmath143 which is the same as equation ( [ 49 ] ) ; q.e.d .",
    "next , we obtain the corresponding pointer states of the environment . using equations ( [ 3.32 ] ) and",

    "let us first obtain @xmath147 ; i.e.  the pointer state of the environment corresponding to the @xmath140 state . replacing the @xmath108 functions from equation ( [ 53 ] ) , @xmath148 and @xmath149 from equation ( [ 59 ] ) and @xmath150 from equation ( [ 65 ] ) we have @xmath151\\ |n\\rangle \\\\+\\sin({\\mathrm{g}}t\\sqrt{n})\\ e^{i\\varphi/2}\\ |n-1\\rangle\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath152 for the coherent field and in the limit of @xmath104 , the above relation can be written as @xmath153\\ \\\\",

    "therefore , the evolution of _ any _ initial state of the system @xmath156 in contact with an initial coherent field @xmath100 can be expressed as a linear combination of the evolution of @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and in the following diagonal form : @xmath159",
    "one interesting feature of the pointer states of the system , given by equation ( [ 66 ] ) , is that at specific times they coincide with each other .",
    "in fact , by looking at equation ( [ 64 ] ) we notice that at those times for which @xmath160 the @xmath161 states are equal to each other .",

    "moreover , as we see , these specific states clearly depend on the phase @xmath165 of the initial state of the coherent field .",
    "the same kind of phenomenon was also discovered in the simpler jaynes - cummings model of quantum optics by gea - banacloche @xcite in 1991 .",
    "in this section we will use the pointer states of the system and the environment , which we already obtained in section 3 , in order to .",

    "also , we observe that this decay is specifically more significant for a smaller average number of photons .",
    "hence , we can guess that the difference between the prediction of equation ( [ 88 ] ) and what we expect from the more exact expression of equation ( [ 81 ] ) , for the case that we have a smaller average number of photons , must be due to the fact that in calculating the pointer states of the system we assumed having a large average number of photons in the environment ( so that we have a sharp distribution for the coherent state of the field and can assume @xmath196 ) .",

    "in fact , by looking at equations ( [ 61 ] ) and ( [ 89 ] ) we notice that _ only _ at the limit of a large average number of photons , where @xmath199 is a good approximation and there is no need to consider the next terms in our expansion for @xmath197  , the function @xmath27 will be independent of the states of the environment and pointer states can be realized for the system and the environment , which do not entangle with each other .",

    "we also showed that at @xmath251 the @xmath161 pointer states of the system coincide with each other and hence , whatever is the initial state of the system , at these specific times the states of the system and the environment are not entangled with each other and the system can be represented by a well - defined state of its own . using our pointer states",
