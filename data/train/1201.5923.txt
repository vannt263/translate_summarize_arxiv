    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will hopefully soon discover the underlying theory for the tev scale and might allow us to understand a more fundamental law of nature . for more than three decades the idea of supersymmetry has attracted the attention of many experts in the particle physics community and the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model  @xcite ( mssm ) is still considered one of the most appealing candidates for the theory of particle physics at the tev scale .",
    "it is well known that the mssm provides an understanding of why the sm - like higgs boson is light , contains a cold dark matter candidate , allows for the unification of the gauge couplings and allows for the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis to explain the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "there are several open issues in the mssm , one of them being the origin of the discrete symmetry r - parity  @xcite .",
    "this symmetry plays a major role in the mssm and it is defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for baryon number , lepton number and spin , respectively . in many mssm studies",
    "it is assumed that r - parity is conserved or explicitly broken without understanding the origin of this symmetry . however , the fate of r - parity is crucial for the discovery of supersymmetry since , as is well known , r - parity conservation give rise to channels with multi - jets , multi - leptons and missing energy at the lhc , while signatures of broken r - parity are multi - leptons , multi - jets , and missing energy due to the sm neutrinos only .",
    "the simplest and most elegant framework for the origin of r - parity is based on local b - l symmetry .",
    "this connection was explored for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in ref .",
    "@xcite a simpler scenario was studied .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete discussion of how to gauge r - parity .",
    "recently , we have investigated the simplest b - l models in refs .",
    "@xcite and found the following main result    _ the simplest theories based on local b - l make the following prediction : + r - parity must be spontaneously broken at the tev scale and + one expects to observe lepton number violation at the lhc ! _    in this letter we study in detail the theory proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which can be considered as the simplest gauge theory for r - parity violation . in this context",
    "the only way to break local b - l and obtain the mssm after symmetry breaking is to give a vacuum expectation value to one of the right - handed sneutrino required by anomaly cancellation .",
    "one of the most important features of this theory is that the b - l and r - parity breaking scales are determined by the soft supersymmetric breaking scale .",
    "this idea was studied for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite which defined the simplest left - right symmetric model .",
    "we review the theory and symmetry breaking mechanism in sections  ii and iii .",
    "the full spectrum of the theory  @xcite is discussed in section  iv and the constraints coming from neutrino masses in section  vi .",
    "we discuss the proton decay issue and the possible dark matter candidates in section  v. in order to understand the testability of the theory we study the properties of the new gauge boson , the neutralino decays in section  vii and in section  viii the main production channels for the charged sleptons at the large hadron collider .",
    "we find that the channels with four charged leptons ( three with the same electric charge ) and four jets give us the most striking signals for the testability of lepton number violation at the lhc .",
    "the simplest gauge theory for spontaneous r - parity breaking was proposed in ref .  @xcite . in this context",
    "one can understand dynamically the origin of the r - parity violating terms in the mssm . here",
    "we discuss the structure of the theory and the full spectrum .    * _ _ : this theory is based on the gauge group @xmath4 and the different matter chiral superfields are given by @xmath5 @xmath6 in order to cancel the @xmath7 anomalies one introduces three chiral superfields for the right - handed neutrinos : @xmath8 * _ _ : the higgs sector is composed of two higgs chiral superfields as in the mssm @xmath9 * _ : _ with this field content the superpotential reads as @xmath10 where @xmath11 in addition to the superpotential , the model is also specified by the soft terms : @xmath12 where the terms not shown here correspond to terms in the soft mssm potential .",
    "+ since we have a new gauge symmetry in the theory we need to modify the kinetic terms for all mssm matter superfields , and include the kinetic term for right - handed neutrino superfields @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the b - l vector superfield . using these interactions we can study the full spectrum of the theory .",
    "as in the mssm , electroweak symmetry is broken by the vevs of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is broken due to the vev of right - handed sneutrinos .",
    "notice that this is the only field which can break local @xmath7 and give mass to the new neutral gauge boson in the theory .",
    "therefore , the theory predicts spontaneous r - parity violation .",

    "the large top yukawa coupling drives the up - type soft higgs mass squared parameter to negative values for generic boundary conditions leading to radiative electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite ; a celebrated success of the mssm .",
    "a valid question is then if the same success is possible in achieving a tachyonic right - handed sneutrino mass in this @xmath7 model as required by eq .",
    "( [ vr.sln ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible through a large yukawa coupling since the yukawa couplings of the right - handed neutrino are all dictated to be small by neutrino masses .",
    "however , there is an alternate possibility whereby a positive mass squared parameter for the right - handed sneutrino at the high scale will run to a tachyonic value at the low scale .",
    "this is due to the presence of the so - called @xmath3-term ( due to @xmath33-term contributions to the rge ) in the soft mass rge , as discussed for this @xmath7 model in  @xcite . a short outline of the mechanism follows .",
    "the rge for the right - handed sneutrino soft mass squared parameter is @xmath34 with @xmath35 where the trace is over the three generations of the fermions and the soft mass parameters in the trace are for the squark doublet , right - handed up squark , right - handed down squark , slepton doublet , right - handed charged slepton and right - handed sneutrino , respectively .",
    "the gaugino mass term always drives the sneutrino mass parameter positive at the low scale but if the overall sign of the @xmath3-term is positive , it could lead to the opposite effect .",
    "such an effect would require a non - zero @xmath3-term at the high scale , which is not possible if the soft masses are universal across the generations of each flavor .",
    "an example of a suitable boundary condition with minimal variation from the popular msugra ansatz is universal boundary conditions for all sfermions except for the right - handed sneutrinos , which might have the boundary conditions @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the universal mass and @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the boundary condition for @xmath40 is then @xmath41 having the necessary sign to contribute negatively to the sneutrino soft mass parameter as it is evolved from the high scale down .",
    "the necessary sizes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 depend on the size of the gaugino mass parameter which has the opposite effect , see  @xcite for more details .",
    "so while , the traditional radiative symmetry breaking from universal boundary conditions is not possible in these models , it is possible to radiatively break @xmath7 through this @xmath3-term starting from a positive value . for the implementation of the radiative mechanism in the non - minimal model see ref .",
    "after symmetry breaking lepton number is spontaneously broken in the form of bilinear r - parity violating interactions .",
    "there are no trilinear r - parity violating interactions at the renormalizable level .",

    "we will assume for simplicity the same value for all soft masses .",
    "in this case if we neglect the left - right mixing the full spectrum of sfermions will be defined by @xmath92 ( the universal soft supersymmetry breaking mass ) , @xmath93 and the mass of the b - l gauge boson . using this simplified spectrum we show in fig.1 the values for the sfermion masses for different values of @xmath94 .",
    "notice that the condition that left - handed slepton masses have to be positive impose a bound on the @xmath94 for a given value of @xmath92 , i.e. @xmath95 . in this way",
    ", we can appreciate that the spectrum can be very constrained .",
    "as it is well - known , in the general case one can not predict the spectrum since the soft masses are unknown .",

    "it is well - known that when r - parity is broken in a supersymmetric theory one has to understand the possible constraints coming from proton decay  @xcite . in the mssm one has several interactions which could mediate proton decay at tree level and one - loop level . at the renormalizable level",
    "one has the lepton and baryon number violating interactions @xmath97 which are not allowed in our theory before b - l breaking , and in general one has the dimension five operators @xmath98 notice that the first term in the above equation is not allowed in our theory , but the last terms can mediate proton decay . the operators @xmath99 and @xmath100 mediate proton decay at one - loop level and typically the scale @xmath101 should be larger than @xmath102 gev in order to satisfy the experimental bounds on proton decay . for a detailed discussion",

    "once b - l is broken by the vev of the right - handed sneutrinos one finds new contributions to proton decay at tree level . from the yukawa coupling @xmath103 one gets the lepton number violating interaction @xmath104 and from the last term , @xmath105 , in the above equation one gets the interaction @xmath106 . using these interactions and integrating out the neutralinos and squarks we find the following constraint @xmath107 from the channel @xmath108 .",

    "therefore , one can say that if the above couplings are order one the cutoff of the theory has to be large . also one can think about possible scenarios where the couplings are small , see for example  @xcite .    at first glance , finding a dark matter in @xmath56-parity violating theories seems hopeless .",
    "but while the traditional neutralino lsp case is no longer valid , the situation is not lost . as first discussed in  @xcite , such models can have an unstable lsp gravitino , with a lifetime longer than the age of the universe .",
    "the strong suppression on its lifetime is due to both the planck mass ( @xmath112 ) suppression associated with its interaction strength and bilinear @xmath56-parity violation which is small due to neutrino masses and must facilitate the decay of the lsp . in the mass insertion approximation , this can be understood as the gravitino going into a photon and neutralino which then has some small mixing with the neutrino due to @xmath56-parity violation ( @xmath113 ) , thereby allowing @xmath114 as in fig .",
    "adopting approximations made in  @xcite , the lifetime for the gravitino decaying into a photon and neutrino ( in years ) is about     ( -30,20)@xmath115 ( -15,25)@xmath116 ( -12.3 , 8)+ ( -18 , 8.5)@xmath117 (-8 , 0)@xmath118 ( -9.8 , 10.4)@xmath113    @xmath119    which for appropriate values of the gravitino mass leads to a long enough life time . unlike in @xmath56-parity conserving models with a gravitino lsp , there are no issues with big bang nucleosynthesis from slow nlsp decay since the nlsp decays more promptly through @xmath56-parity violating interactions .",
    "several interesting studies have been conducted on the signatures and constraints of unstable gravitino dark matter , see for example  @xcite .",
