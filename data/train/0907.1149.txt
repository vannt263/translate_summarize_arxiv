    "de sitter ( ds ) spacetime is one of the simplest and most interesting spacetimes allowed by general relativity .",
    "quantum field theory in this background has been extensively studied during the past two decades .",
    "much of early interest was motivated by the questions related to the quantization of fields propagating on curved backgrounds .",
    "ds spacetime has a high degree of symmetry and numerous physical problems are exactly solvable on this background .",
    "the importance of this theoretical work increased by the appearance of  the inflationary cosmology scenario @xcite . in most inflationary models ,",
    "an approximately ds spacetime is employed to solve a number of problems in standard cosmology . during an inflationary epoch ,",
    "quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field introduce inhomogeneities which play a central role in the generation of cosmic structures from inflation .",
    "more recently , astronomical observations of high redshift supernovae , galaxy clusters and cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that at the present epoch the universe is accelerating and can be well approximated by a world with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "if the universe would accelerate indefinitely , the standard cosmology would lead to an asymptotic ds universe .",
    "hence , the investigation of physical effects in ds spacetime is important for understanding both the early universe and its future .",
    "another motivation for investigations of ds based quantum theories is related to the holographic duality between quantum gravity on ds spacetime and a quantum field theory living on boundary identified with the timelike infinity of ds spacetime @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect is among the most striking macroscopic manifestations of non - trivial properties of the quantum vacuum .",
    "the presence of reflecting boundaries alters the zero - point modes of a quantized field and shifts the vacuum expectation values of quantities , such as the energy density and stresses . as a result ,",
    "vacuum forces arise acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of these forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometry and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field . since the original work by casimir @xcite many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the casimir effect can be viewed as a polarization of vacuum by boundary conditions .",
    "the interaction of fluctuating quantum fields with background gravitational fields gives rise to another type of vacuum polarization ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "here we will study an example with both types of vacuum polarization .",
    "namely , we evaluate the vacuum expectation values for the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor of a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter induced by a plane boundary on background of @xmath0-dimensional ds spacetime .",
    "previously the casimir effect on background of ds spacetime described in planar coordinates was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite for a conformally coupled massless scalar field . in this case",
    "the problem is conformally related to the corresponding problem in minkowski spacetime and the vacuum characteristics are generated from those for the minkowski counterpart multiplying by the conformal factor . in particular , for the geometry of a single plate the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor vanishes . in saha04 the vacuum expectation value of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor for a conformally coupled scalar field is investigated in ds spacetime with static coordinates in presence of curved branes on which the field obeys the robin boundary conditions with coordinate dependent coefficients ( for investigations of the casimir energy in braneworld models with ds branes see refs .",

    "the conformal relation between ds and rindler spacetimes and the results for the rindler counterpart @xcite were used .",
    "more recently , the casimir densities in ds spacetime with toroidally compactified spatial dimensions were investigated in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section the geometry of the problem",
    "is described and the corresponding positive frequency wightman function is evaluated for the general case of the curvature coupling parameter and for robin boundary condition on the plane boundary . in quantum field theory on curved backgrounds among the important quantities describing the local properties of a quantum field and quantum back - reaction effects are the expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor . in sections [ sec : phi2 ] and [ sec : emt ] , by using the expression for the wightman function , we investigate the parts in these expectation values induced by the plate .",
    "simple asymptotic formulae are obtained for small and large proper distances from the plate with respect to the ds curvature scale .",
    "the special cases of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are discussed in section [ sec : dir ] .",
    "the main results are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "for a scalar field with curvature coupling parameter @xmath1  the field equation has the form@xmath2where @xmath3 is the covariant derivative operator and @xmath4 is the ricci scalar for the background spacetime .",

    "in the present paper we have investigated the vevs of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter induced by a plane boundary in ds spacetime .",
    "the robin boundary condition was assumed on the boundary . as the first step we have constructed the corresponding positive frequency wightman function .",
    "this function is presented in the form of the sum of boundary - free and boundary induced parts . for points",
    "away from the boundary the latter is finite in the coincidence limit of the arguments and can be directly used for the evaluation of the vevs of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "these vevs are decomposed into boundary - free ds and plate induced parts . due to the maximal symmetry of ds spacetime and the ds invariance of the bunch - davies vacuum",
    "the boundary - free parts do not depend on the spacetime point .",
    "these parts are well investigated in the literature and we were focused on the plate induced parts .",
    "the latter are given by formula ( phi21pl ) for the field squared and by formula ( [ tii1 ] ) for the energy - momentum tensor and they are functions on the combinations @xmath80 and @xmath69 only .",
    "the first of these ratios is the proper distance from the plate measured in units of the curvature scale @xmath172 .",
    "an interesting feature is that the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is non - diagonal with the off - diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the direction normal to the plate . in dependence of the parameters",
    ", this flux can be either positive or negative .",
    "for special case of a conformally coupled massless scalar field the general formula for the vev of the field squared is simplified to ( [ phi2conf ] ) and the plate induced energy - momentum tensor vanishes .",
    "these results can also be obtained from the corresponding flat spacetime results by using the conformal relation between the geometries .    for general values of the curvature coupling parameter the formulae for the plate induced vevs",
    "are further simplified in the asymptotic regions of small and large proper distances from the plate . in the first case the leading term in the asymptotic expansions have the form ( [ phi2small ] ) for the field squared and the form ( [ emtaslarge ] ) for the energy - momentum tensor . near the plate we have @xmath173 and the total vev of the energy - momentum tensor",
    "is dominated by the boundary induced part . at large proper distances from the plate the behavior of the plate induced parts is qualitatively different for real and pure imaginary values of the parameter @xmath87 . in the first case these parts decay",
    "monotonically as @xmath174 for the field squared and for the diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor and like @xmath175 for the off - diagonal component @xmath137 . in this limit",
    "the diagonal vacuum stresses are isotropic . for imaginary values of the parameter",
    "@xmath87 the asymptotic behavior of the plate induced vevs at large proper distances from the plate is described by formulae ( [ phi2largeimag ] ) and ( [ t0dimagnu ] ) and is damping oscillatory . for a fixed value of @xmath89 the oscillating period in terms of the synchronous time coordinate",
    "is equal to @xmath153 .",
    "the special cases of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are considered in section [ sec : dir ] . for these cases the formulae for the expectation values",
    "are further simplified to ( [ phi2dir])-([tiidir ] ) and they have opposite signs for dirichlet and neumann scalars .",
