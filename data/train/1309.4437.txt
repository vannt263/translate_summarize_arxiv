    "the concave shape is a general feature of the invariant mass method for reconstructing @xmath0 of decay particles  @xcite : the background photon pairs on average have a small opening angle owing to the asymmetry cut , and hence they have a larger anisotropy compared to photons from @xmath2 decay .",
    "the two photons of the mixed - event pairs are chosen from an event class with similar event plane orientations , so they have a sizable anisotropy @xmath73 . however , because the two events used to construct the mixed - event do not have exactly the same ep angle , @xmath74 is smaller than the @xmath56 by a factor that depends on the ep resolution and the bin width of the ep class used for event mixing , but is independent of @xmath54 .",

    "these trends are consistent with the presence of a dijet bias , which grows as the pseudorapidity gap between the ep and the @xmath2 or @xmath3 meson is reduced . for pseudorapidity gaps @xmath911.5 , the dijets bias the ep angle towards the direction of the @xmath2 , which results in a larger @xmath0 value .",
