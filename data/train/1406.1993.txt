    ". however one must be cautious about the primordial gravitational waves interpretation of the bicep2 data since new analysis @xcite has pointed out that light scattering from dust as well as synchrotron radiation produced by electrons wandering around the galactic magnetic fields within the milky way may also generate the b - mode in the foreground . on the other hand ,",
    "these bounds are consistent with that from the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xmath7 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the standard scenario with three active , massless neutrinos predicts @xmath8 at the cmb epoch  @xcite .    there has been a lot of attempts to account for a possible deviation from the theoretical prediction  @xcite .",
    "recently , weinberg  @xcite has investigated whether goldstone bosons can be masquerading as fractional cosmic neutrinos .",
    "the motivation is that they would be massless or nearly massless , and their characteristic derivative coupling would make them very weakly - interacting at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the most crucial criterion is that these goldstone bosons must decouple from the thermal bath early enough so that their temperature is lower than that of the neutrinos .",
    "to realize this idea , weinberg has considered the simplest possible broken continuous symmetry , a global @xmath0 symmetry associated with the conservation of some quantum number @xmath9 .",
    "a complex scalar field @xmath10 , which is a singlet in the standard model ( sm ) while carrying a nonvanishing value of @xmath9 , is introduced for breaking this symmetry spontaneously .",
    "the thermal history of the resulting goldstone boson depends crucially on its coupling to the sm higgs field and the mass of the radial field .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that these goldstone bosons can contribute about @xmath11 to the effective number of light species .",
    "recently , collider phenomenology of the goldstone boson has been discussed  @xcite and energy loss due to goldstone boson emission in the cooling of a post - collapse supernova core were examined  @xcite .",

    "we extend the higgs portal model by gauging the @xmath0 symmetry , thus trading the goldstone boson with a massive gauge field , which is indeed a type of the so - called dark photon . if the dark photon couples to the thermal bath as the goldstone boson case @xcite until the muon annihilation era , with its three polarization states its contribution to @xmath1 would be three times larger , namely @xmath13 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the planck or even the combined planck + bicep2 data .",

    "we finally summarize in section viii .",

    ". we will identify @xmath30 to be the physical sm higgs boson @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath31 be the physical dark higgs boson with mass @xmath37 much less than @xmath38 .    in this model ,",
    "the interaction of the dark photons with the sm particles arises entirely from a mixing of the dark higgs boson with the sm higgs boson . from the interaction term @xmath39",

    "equivalence theorem states that in the high - energy limit the goldstone bosons will control the emission or absorption of the massive gauge bosons .",

    "this means that the lhc bound on the dark higgs coupling to sm higgs @xmath64 will become @xmath65 times stronger by then .",
    "furthermore , if the international linear collider ( ilc ) construction could begin in 2015/2016 and complete after 10 years , it may constrain the branching ratio of higgs invisible decays to @xmath66 - @xmath67  @xcite in the best scenarios .",

    "<S> recently , weinberg proposed a higgs portal model with a spontaneously broken global @xmath0 symmetry in which goldstone bosons may be masquerading as fractional cosmic neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the model by gauging the @xmath0 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to the so - called dark photon and dark higgs . </S>",
    "<S> the dark photons can constitute about 0.912 ( 0.167 ) to the effective number of light neutrino species if they decouple from the thermal bath before the pions become non - relativistic and after ( before ) the qcd transition . </S>",
    "<S> restriction on the parameter space of the portal coupling and the dark higgs mass is obtained from the freeze - out condition of the dark photons . </S>",
    "<S> combining with the collider data constraints on the invisible width of the standard model higgs requires the dark higgs mass to be less than a few gev . </S>"
