    "brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) offer an important probe of the formation of the central structure of elliptical galaxies , and the role of central massive black holes in this process . by their very definition ,",
    "bcgs are highly luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "the high luminosities of the bcgs , together with their central location in galaxy clusters , suggest that the processes which shape the centers of giant ellipticals should be most easily observable in these systems . due to their high luminosities , and the strong correlation between galaxy luminosity and central black hole mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , bcgs are expected to harbor the most massive black holes . due to their central location in galaxy clusters",
    ", we expect them to cannibalize other cluster galaxies even at the current epoch .",
    "the great homogeneity in the global properties and in the environment of the bcgs gives us perhaps the best opportunity to understand the central structures found in elliptical galaxies .    over the past decade , many high resolution imaging studies of elliptical galaxy centers have been performed with the _ hubble space telescope _   ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter f97 ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting discoveries to emerge from these studies has been that , at _ hst _ resolution , elliptical galaxies generally have central cusps in their brightness profiles instead of constant density cores .",
    "in addition , elliptical galaxies display a large range in the central logarithmic slope of their brightness profile .",
    "in luminous ellipticals ( @xmath6 ) the radial surface brightness profile shows a clear break in the steepness of the profile at a resolved radius . inside the break",
    "radius the surface brightness increases less steeply towards the nucleus , resulting in a shallow cusp at small radii .",
    "these galaxies are commonly called `` core '' galaxies ( e.g. , f97 ) .",
    "no clear break in the surface brightness profile is seen in less - luminous galaxies ( @xmath7 ) , which generally have steep `` power - law '' brightness profiles into the resolution limit of the _",
    "hst_.    it is of great interest to understand the origin of the central density cusps of elliptical galaxies , and their relation to other galaxy properties .",
    "this is because the cusps are determined by the same physical processes that shape the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies as a whole .",
    "cusps may be created by at least three different processes .",
    "first , violent relaxation in a collisionless system during galaxy formation is seen to create central density cusps in numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , gaseous dissipation with star formation has been shown to effectively create cusps , especially during galaxy mergers or accretion events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "third , a single massive black hole in the center of a galaxy may produce a stellar density cusp , either by the slow growth of a black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or by its mere presence @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of the core and power - law types of central brightness profiles in the family of elliptical galaxies is intriguing , given the expectation that less - luminous galaxies are often cannibalized by giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "there is ample evidence that cannibalism is taking place ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the cores of the most luminous galaxies show few signs of the remains of accreted less - luminous galaxies , whose dense centers would be expected to arrive at the centers of the giant galaxies largely `` undigested . ''",
    "the lack of evidence for the remains of the centers of accreted galaxies could be due to the presence of massive black holes , which are believed to be ubiquitous in the centers of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a massive black hole at the center of the brighter galaxy may serve to disrupt the nucleus of the in - falling , cannibalized galaxy @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if both of the merging progenitors contain a central black hole , the merger may actually be responsible for the creation of a core ( f97 ) .",
    "a binary black hole system will eject stars from the nuclear regions by three - body interactions , thereby lowering the stellar density ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "several scenarios for the formation and evolution of the central density cusps in elliptical galaxies have been compared in detail to _ hst _ data ( e.g. , f97 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the richness of central structure seen across the entire range of galaxy luminosities and environments makes it challenging to isolate the physics that is most relevant to the formation of shallow cusps in luminous galaxies .",
    "study of a sample of galaxies that is purposely chosen to be homogeneous in global properties may allow improved insight into the common mechanisms that shape the central structure of luminous galaxies .",
    "this is the approach that we adopt here .",
    "we present the results of an _ hst _ imaging study of a large sample of bcgs .",
    "we concentrate mostly on the central surface brightness profiles in the present paper , and report on the correlation between these profiles , black hole masses , and radio powers , in a later paper .",
    "our initial sample consisted of the 119 bcgs in the clusters of the @xcite catalog and its southern extension @xcite that satisfy the following criteria : ( i ) measured redshift @xmath8  @xmath9  15,000 km  s@xmath10 ; ( ii ) galactic latitude @xmath11 ; and ( iii ) elliptical galaxy morphology .",
    "further slight adjustments to the sample were made based on uncertain redshifts and the lack of overdensity , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the brightest galaxy in each cluster was found by looking for the brightest metric magnitude within a given physical radius @xcite .",
    "we observed the sample in the context of the _ hst _ snapshot program 8683 ( pi : van der marel ) . due to the nature of snapshot programs ,",
    "observations were not performed for all 119 galaxies in the sample but only for a randomly chosen subset of 75 .",
    "we expanded the observed sample by including seven bcgs ( abells 262 , 569 , 1060 , 1656 , 2162 , 3565 , and 3742 ) for which observations already existed in the _ hst _ data archive with the same filter and camera ( three of which were observed previously by two of us and reported in @xcite ) . the final sample for the present study includes a total of 81 galaxies .",
    ", compared to the mean velocity of the cluster at 30477  km  s@xmath10 @xcite . at the time the @xcite sample was defined ,",
    "reliable redshifts for all the clusters and bcgs were not available , and this galaxy was erroneously determined to be the bcg of abell 3367 .",
    "consequently , we dropped this galaxy from our sample . ]    the list of observed galaxies is given in table  [ t : sample ] with a number of basic characteristics .",
    "angular diameter distances were estimated from the redshifts @xmath12 after conversion into the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) frame , as described by @xcite .",
    "we used a hubble constant @xmath13 and a cosmology with @xmath14 .",
    "because the galaxies are relatively nearby , the dependence on the adopted cosmology is negligible for the purposes of the present study .",
    "an important quantity for the interpretation of the results of our study is the total luminosity of each galaxy , which is determined by the total observed magnitude .",
    "the metric magnitude of the sample galaxies inside an aperture of @xmath5 radius has previously been accurately determined .",
    "however , bcgs can be extremely extended and diffuse , and the metric magnitude provides only limited insight into the total magnitude .",
    "we therefore estimated the total magnitude using the @xmath15-band surface brightness profiles presented by @xcite .",
    "we transformed these to the @xmath16-band using an assumed @xmath17 , which combines the observed mean @xmath18 from @xcite with the value @xmath19 that is typical for giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we integrated the best - fitting de vaucouleurs @xmath20 law from the center to infinity , properly taking into account the galaxy ellipticity , and corrected the result for foreground galactic extinction and bandshift ( k - correction ) .",
    "the total magnitudes thus obtained were combined with the luminosity distance ( the angular diameter distance times @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] ) to obtain the total absolute magnitude and galaxy luminosity .",
    "all images were taken with the wfpc2 instrument @xcite on board the _ hst _ between 2000 july 3 and 2001 july 26 .",
    "the target bcgs were positioned on the pc chip , which has a pixel size of 00455  @xmath22  00455  and a field of view of 364  @xmath22  364 .",
    "the placement on the chip was chosen so as to include also any nearby overlapping cluster galaxies or multiple nuclei on the pc chip where possible .",
    "we used the f814w filter , which mimics the @xmath0 band .",
    "the total integration time was 1000 seconds , split into two exposures of 500 seconds to allow for cosmic ray rejection .",
    "we employed the stsdas task wfixup to interpolate ( in the x - direction ) over bad pixels as identified in the data quality files .",
    "we also used the stsdas task warmpix to correct consistently warm pixels in the data , using the most recent warm pixel tables which are provided by the wfpc2 instrument group at stsci about once a month .",
    "the stsdas task ccrej was used to combine the two 500 second exposures .",
    "this step corrects most of the pixels affected by cosmic rays in the combined image . in general , a few cosmic rays remain uncorrected , mostly when the same pixel was hit in both exposures .",
    "also , a small number of hot pixels remain uncorrected because they are not listed even in the most recent warm pixel tables .",
    "we corrected these with the iraf task cosmicrays , setting the `` threshold '' and `` fluxratio '' parameters to suitable values that were selected by a careful comparison of the images before and after correction to ensure that only questionable pixels were replaced .",
    "the photometric calibration and conversion to the johnson @xmath0 band were performed according to the description given by @xcite .",
    "we corrected for foreground galactic extinction using the tables given by @xcite , assuming a k5 spectrum , and using the e(@xmath23 ) values from the work of @xcite .",
    "the k - correction was made using the values given by @xcite .",
    "gray - scale images of the central 4@xmath224  region of the sample galaxies are shown in figure  [ f : images ] .",
    "inspection of the images shows that all galaxies generally have an elliptical galaxy morphology , consistent with the ground - based selection criteria .",
    "one galaxy , the bcg of abell 3676 , has a morphology that is somewhat suggestive of a spiral galaxy .",
    "this galaxy was excluded from the discussions of surface brightness profiles in sections  [ s : sbprofs ] and  [ s : cusps ] . however , even among the galaxies with unambiguous elliptical galaxy morphologies we find many interesting morphological features in the images , including multiple nuclei , various dust absorption features , and embedded stellar disks .",
    "we briefly discuss these before proceeding with a more quantitative analysis .",
    "for all the galaxies in the sample the center can be unambiguously identified .",
    "however , it is not uncommon for bcgs to possess one or more secondary nuclei separated from the primary galaxy center .",
    "a secondary nucleus can either be physically associated with the bcg , suggesting that a companion galaxy is currently being accreted , or it can be a mere chance projection of another cluster member .",
    "morphological studies of individual galaxies have suggested that the latter possibility is more common @xcite .",
    "statistical studies of the kinematics of secondary nuclei have provided support for this interpretation ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our sample , 32 of the 81 ( 40% ) bcgs have at least one secondary nucleus within the area imaged by the pc chip .",
    "these bcgs are identified in the last column of table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "we did not make any attempt in the present context to separate obvious secondary nuclei from probable chance projections .",
    "a study of the properties of the multiple nuclei at _ hst _ resolution may shed new light on their nature ; however , such an investigation is outside the scope of the present paper .    in two galaxies ,",
    "the bcgs of abell 347 and 3526 , it appears that the main galaxy center itself has a double morphology .",
    "high resolution images of the central regions of these galaxies are shown in figure  [ f : double ] . in the bcg of abell 347 ,",
    "both brightness peaks have a diffuse nature .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more discussion on this galaxy .",
    "by contrast , in the bcg of abell 3526 ( the centaurus cluster ) one of the peaks is unresolved .",
    "such point source nuclei are generally due to optical emission from an agn component , as discussed in section  [ ss : pointnuclei ] below .",
    "abell 3526 also has a spectacular dust lane that wraps around the center ( see figure  [ f : dust ] ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for a recent infall of a gas - rich galaxy into the bcg @xcite .",
    "such an event may also explain the double nucleus .",
    "we visually inspected all the galaxies for signs of absorption by dust .",
    "we did this first in the original images , and subsequently in images from which an elliptical model for the galaxy light was subtracted ( the construction of these models is described in section  [ ss : sbanalysis ] below ) .",
    "signs of dust absorption are evident in 31 of the 81 sample galaxies ( 38% of the sample ) .",
    "these galaxies are identified in the last column of table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "the dust can have a variety of different morphologies .",
    "these include nuclear dust disks , dust filaments , patchy dust , and dust rings or dust spirals around the nuclei .",
    "representative images of these various dust morphologies are shown in figure  [ f : dust ] .",
    "table  [ t : dust ] provides a morphological description of the dust features that we found in the individual galaxies .",
    "the most common classes of dust are dust filaments and nuclear dust disks .",
    "filamentary dust is found in 14 of the 81 sample galaxies ( 17% of the sample ) and nuclear dust disks in 11 of the 81 sample galaxies ( 14% of the sample ) .",
    "dust features in elliptical galaxies at _ hst _ resolution have previously been studied by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied a mixed sample of 64 galaxies from the _ hst _ archive in the @xmath16-band ( the f555w filter ) , and detected dust in about 50% of these galaxies .",
    "they deduced from the distribution of the axis ratio of the dust features that 78% @xmath24 16% of early - type galaxies contain nuclear dust .",
    "our detection rate of 39% is somewhat lower than theirs .",
    "this may reflect the larger average distance of our sample , yielding a lower spatial resolution in physical units , and the use of the @xmath16-band by @xcite , where the effects of dust are more obvious than in the @xmath0-band .",
    "@xcite studied an _",
    "hst _ sample of 19 radio galaxies , observed through the f555w filter , and detected dust in 17 of them .",
    "this large fraction may be due to a correlation between radio - loudness or radio - power and the existence of dust . to further address this particular issue we are observing our sample of bcgs with the vla at 20 cm .",
    "we will report on these observations , as well as on any possible correlations that we may find with , e.g. , dust properties or nuclear black hole mass , in future papers .",
    "finally , @xcite detected dust in 43% of a distance - limited _ hst _ sample of 67 early - type galaxies , using images in the @xmath15-band ( f702w filter ) , and in 78% of a sample of 40 galaxies for which they used any optical images that they could find in the _ hst _ archive .",
    "the latter sample was biased towards detecting dust features by the virtue of relatively high _ iras _ fluxes at 60 and 100 @xmath25 m .",
    "they found the dust to be in a nuclear disk in 18% of the distance - limited sample , and in 38% of the _ iras_-biased sample .",
    "these numbers compare well with our findings .",
    "we found that in two of our 81 sample galaxies ( 2% of the sample ) the circumnuclear morphology has a high ellipticity , suggesting the possible presence of an edge - on nuclear disk .",
    "these galaxies are identified in the last column of table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "this result is consistent with the finding of nuclear stellar disks in other samples of elliptical galaxies observed with _",
    "hst _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our detection rate is not nearly as high as that reported by @xcite , who find evidence for nuclear stellar disks in 51% of a distance - limited sample of 67 early - type galaxies ( the same sample was used by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , they used `` disky '' perturbations of the isophotes , characterized by a positive fourth order coefficient of the cosine term in a fourier - decomposition of the light profile , as an indicator of underlying stellar disks .",
    "such a method is likely to provide a much larger `` detected '' fraction of nuclear stellar disks , since positive fourth order coefficients , however small , will be taken as an indicator of a disk .",
    "our low detection rate of nuclear stellar disks should also partly reflect the larger average distance of our sample , compared to the sample of @xcite .",
    "this results in a lower spatial resolution in physical units , so that small stellar disks are not resolved .",
    "it is also possible that stellar disks are less common at the high end of the elliptical galaxy luminosity function .",
    "for quantitative surface brightness profile analysis we ran the images through 20 iterations of the lucy - richardson deconvolution routine @xcite .",
    "the number of iterations was decided after considerable experimentation with varying numbers of iterations .",
    "we used 20 iterations here instead of the 40 used by @xcite since our data have lower signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we used a point - spread function ( psf ) generated by the tinytim software @xcite for the center of the pc chip of wfpc2 , and a k - type stellar spectrum .",
    "the diameter of the synthetic psf was 3 , and we tapered the psf at the edges with an eight pixel gaussian .    before performing any fits we inspected the images by eye on the computer screen .",
    "obvious signs of dust , image defects and foreground stars were masked .",
    "we then fitted ellipses to the isophotes of the two - dimensional convolved and deconvolved images .",
    "the nucleus was usually found by calculating the centroid in a small box around the center of the galaxy , but for diffuse cores we used a cross - correlation technique .",
    "after the ellipse fitting , a model was constructed from the fits and subtracted from the original image .",
    "we then confirmed the dust features by looking at the residual map , and masked these dust features before performing any profile fitting .    for 13 of the sample galaxies we found that the effects of dust are so severe that it was not possible to determine a meaningful surface brightness profile .",
    "these galaxies were excluded from the discussion that follows .",
    "for another eight galaxies the effects of dust caused significant uncertainties in the stellar surface brightness distribution close to the nucleus . since this is the region of primary interest in the present context",
    ", we excluded these galaxies from the fitting of the profiles in section  [ ss : paramfits ] , and from the remainder of the discussion .",
    "however , we do show the surface brightness profiles of these galaxies to the extent that they could be determined , in figure  [ f : profiles ] .",
    "this leaves a sample of 60 bcgs for which a surface brightness profile could be determined that is reliable at both small and large radii .",
    "the major - axis surface brightness profiles for these galaxies , together with analytical fits discussed in section  [ ss : paramfits ] , are shown in figure  [ f : profiles ] .",
    "column ( 10 ) of table  [ t : sample ] indicates to which of the above classes each galaxy belongs .    between the nucleus and 05 we used the profile task in the vista package to find the surface brightness profile .",
    "this task keeps the center fixed and fits ellipses by sampling the light profile in a circle with a radius of 1 , 2 , 3 , etc .",
    "pixels . between the radii of 05 and 1  we used the snuc task in vista which is capable of fitting ellipses to multiple , overlapping objects @xcite .",
    "this was required for some of the galaxies where we saw two or more elliptical nuclei superimposed on the bcg image . for abell 347 , which has a double - peaked central morphology",
    ", we took the profile within 1  from the work of @xcite , where the profile was extracted using a one - dimensional cut across the nucleus .",
    "beyond 1  we used the original ( not psf - deconvolved ) image for all galaxies , since there is little gain in deconvolution at large radii , in particular since the @xmath26 is lower there .",
    "we verified the ellipse fits in about half a dozen bcgs by the ellipfit task in the galphot package @xcite and the ellipse task in the iraf package .",
    "we found good agreement between the results from the various packages .",
    "we identified 10 bcgs in the sample which have a bright point source in the very center on top of the smooth stellar surface brightness profile .",
    "these galaxies are identified in the last column of table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "the point source component can be identified as an upturn ( an inflection point ) in the surface brightness profile at @xmath27 from the center ; see the panels for abell 195 , 496 , 548 , 3526 , 3570 , 3656 , and 3744 in figure  [ f : profiles ] . because of complications in the determination of their surface brightness profiles due to dust .",
    "one other nucleated bcg ( abell 2052 ) is shown in figure  [ f : profiles ] , but for this galaxy the surface brightness profile could only be reliably determined for @xmath28 . ]",
    "abell 3744 is listed as `` nuc ? '' in table  [ t : sample ] because the dust makes it hard to establish unambiguously that there is in fact a point source nucleus .",
    "abell 3574 has a bright point source that is offset by @xmath29 from the isophotal center ( see figure  [ f : hollow ] below ) . because the point source is not at the center",
    ", we have not marked this galaxy as `` nucleated '' in table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "of course , its point source could be an off - center variation to the point - sources seen in the centers of the other galaxies .",
    "however , it could just as well be a foreground star . in the absence of additional information",
    "it is impossible to address the true nature of this source .",
    "central point sources in bright elliptical galaxies are generally due to optical emission from an agn component .",
    "a well - known example is m87 @xcite , for which the non - thermal nature of the point source has been confirmed spectroscopically @xcite . _",
    "hst _ observations of samples of radio galaxies have revealed optical point source nuclei in a majority of the sample galaxies .",
    "the detection rates reported by @xcite and @xcite are 85% and 57% , respectively .      to interpret the results we fitted a function of the form @xmath30^{\\tau})^{\\frac{\\gamma - \\beta}{\\tau}}\\ ] ] to the inferred surface brightness profiles .",
    "this so - called `` nuker law ''",
    "@xcite represents a broken power - law with a turn - over at a break radius @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 measures the sharpness of the break ( it is usually referred to as @xmath4 , but we use @xmath31 to avoid confusion with another parameter @xmath4 that is often used for bcgs ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the asymptotic power - law slope is @xmath32 at small radii and @xmath33 at large radii .",
    "we did not enforce @xmath32 to be positive in the fit , but instead allowed both positive and negative values .",
    "a negative value of @xmath32 corresponds to a surface brightness profile with a central minimum .",
    "while this may seem counter - intuitive , some galaxies are indeed well described by such a model ( see @xcite and section  [ ss : hollow ] below ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 determines the normalization of the brightness profile .",
    "the best - fitting nuker laws are plotted in figure  [ f : profiles ] as solid curves .",
    "the parameters of these fits are given in table  [ t : nukerfits ] .",
    "the fits were generally performed over the radial range from @xmath35 ( i.e. , the central pixel ) to @xmath36 from the galaxy center . for nucleated galaxies",
    "only the data with @xmath37 were included in fit .",
    "the parameters of a nuker - law fit are well - defined , but some care must be exercised in their interpretation . for example , @xmath32 is the logarithmic slope of the profile for @xmath38 . however , whether the observed profile actually reaches this slope at observationally accessible radii depends on the values of @xmath3 and @xmath31 . in the following",
    "we will work with the quantity @xmath39 , which we define to be the power - law slope @xmath40 at 005 from the galaxy center .",
    "this is the last reliable radius outside the _ hst _ resolution limit in the deconvolved profiles .",
    "therefore , it offers the best view of the cusp slope as the radius approaches zero .",
    "this will correspond to different physical radii in the bcgs at varying distances , but in general 005  is @xmath41 @xmath3 . since the slope may flatten toward the very center",
    ", @xmath39 gives us an upper limit to the asymptotic @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath39 is listed for all galaxies in table  [ t : nukerfits ] .",
    "is based on an inward extrapolation of the fit that was performed at radii @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 is somewhat less robustly established for these galaxies , compared to the remainder of the sample . ]",
    "similar caveats apply to the interpretation of the fit parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this is the radius at which the fit has its maximum logarithmic curvature @xcite .",
    "we allowed for @xmath32 to have negative values to fit the flat or sometimes downwards sloping central profiles .",
    "note that we restricted the fitting range to @xmath42  in the bcgs of abell 76 , 347 , 634 , 3742 , and 3747 , instead of the usual @xmath43 , to better fit the break radii .",
    "in a few cases a good fit was not possible with a nuker profile , not even after restricting the fit range . however , such cases were very few ( abell 376 , 1177 , and 1314 ) , and do not affect the main results of this paper .",
    "there are six galaxies in the sample for which @xmath44 ( i.e. , the surface brightness increases radially outwards at 005 ) , which indicates that there is a central depression in the surface brightness .",
    "these galaxies are the bcgs of abell 76 , 260 , 347 , 634 , 3574 , and 3716 ( figure  [ f : hollow ] ) .",
    "they are labeled as ` hollow ' in the last column of table  [ t : sample ] .",
    "one possible explanation is that the center of these galaxies may be covered by a small patch of dust that is not morphologically obvious , and hence was not masked during the surface brightness profile analysis . without images in other passbands",
    "it is impossible to assess whether this is the correct explanation .",
    "such color index images might reveal a subtle reddening towards the center , indicative of dust absorption .",
    "on the other hand , it is quite possible that there is no dust extinction and that these galaxies do in fact have a depression in their three - dimensional stellar luminosity density .",
    "this has been argued to be the case for three elliptical galaxies observed in other _",
    "programs for which color information is in fact available @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ s : intro ] , _ hst _ has been used to study the surface brightness profiles in various samples of elliptical galaxies . an important focus of all these studies",
    "has been to understand what the central cusp slopes are , and how this correlates with other galaxy properties .",
    "the nuker team ( @xcite ; f97 ) found a dichotomy in the asymptotic power - law slopes at zero radius .",
    "the power - law indices were found to be either larger than @xmath45 or smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "galaxies with asymptotic power - law indices @xmath47 were coined `` core galaxies , '' and those with power - law indices @xmath48 were named `` power - law galaxies . ''",
    "this dichotomy in the central power - law slope correlates well with several other parameters .",
    "core galaxies usually have large total luminosities , boxy central isophotes , large central velocity dispersions , and low rates of rotation .",
    "by contrast , power - law galaxies usually have smaller total luminosities , disky isophotes , low central velocity dispersions , and relatively high rates of rotation .",
    "a number of more recent studies have confirmed these results in broad terms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to see how the results that we have obtained here for bcgs compare to those obtained previously for other elliptical galaxies . in figure",
    "[ f : gammavsrad ] we plot the central power - law slope @xmath39 versus the break - radius @xmath3 in arcsec .",
    "this is similar to figure 3 of f97 .",
    "we use this plot , combined with a visual inspection of the brightness profiles in figure  [ f : profiles ] , to distinguish core galaxies from power - law galaxies . out of the 60 galaxies for which we have fitted surface brightness profiles ,",
    "52 have @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( rectangular box in figure  [ f : gammavsrad ] ) .",
    "these are core galaxies with well - resolved cores .",
    "another six galaxies ( the bcgs of abell 189 , 261 , 419 , 912 , 1228 , 2247 ) have @xmath51 . these are power - law galaxies .",
    "this leaves two galaxies that fall in neither of these regions of @xmath52 space . for these",
    "the classification is more complicated .",
    "one of them ( the bcg of abell 168 ) , while having @xmath53 , shows a pronounced turnover to a shallow slope .",
    "we therefore conclude that the bcg of abell 168 is a core galaxy . the other galaxy ( the bcg of abell 1983 ) has @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "the profile for this galaxy is steep down to the _ hst _ resolution limit ; steeper than core profiles , but not as steep as power - law profiles .",
    "it is possible that in this galaxy we have just resolved the break in the surface brightness profile , but there are not enough data points to resolve the smaller cusp slope inside the break radius .",
    "we classify this galaxy tentatively as ` intermediate - slope ' ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and set an upper limit for its core radius .",
    "it is noteworthy that there are no examples of intermediate type galaxies where @xmath3 is well - resolved .",
    "we address the significance of the power - law vs.  core - type dichotomy in sections  [ ss : globalprop ] ( correlation with luminosity ) and [ ss : hostcor ] ( correlation with host galaxy properties ) , and we discuss the meaning of the results in section  [ s : disc ] .",
    "the final classifications for all galaxies are listed in table  [ t : nukerfits ] .",
    "the breakdown of the sample is : 53 core galaxies ( 88% ) , six power - law galaxies ( 10% ) , and one intermediate - slope galaxy ( 2% ) .    in principle",
    ", any core galaxy can be made to look like a power - law galaxy if it is placed at a sufficiently large distance .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the extent to which profile shape classifications may depend on distance .",
    "f97 discussed this issue for their sample and found that the distinction between core and power - law galaxies is an intrinsic one , and is not due to differences in distance .",
    "this is true for our bcg sample as well , for two reasons .",
    "first , there is no correlation between distance and whether or not a bcg in our sample has a power - law or a core profile ; the average distances are similar for the power - law and the core galaxies in the sample ( @xmath55 versus @xmath56 , respectively ) .",
    "second , the power - law galaxies in our sample have _ higher _ central surface brightnesses than the core galaxies in our sample . if the power - law galaxies in our sample were the more distant cousins of the core galaxies in our sample , seen at distances at which the core is not resolved , then their observed central surface brightnesses would be averages over larger physical regions . since surface brightness generally falls with radius in a galaxy , the power - law galaxies",
    "should then have had lower observed central surface brightnesses than core galaxies , contrary to the observations .    as was done by f97",
    ", we treat the break radii in power - law ( and intermediate ) galaxies differently from the core bcgs .",
    "the value of @xmath3 for the power - law galaxies sets a spatial scale by the maximum in the second logarithmic derivative for a gradually varying profile that is not a pure power - law .",
    "however , since there is no clear break , these @xmath3 values can not be meaningfully compared to the break radii observed for core galaxies . to obtain the upper limits to the radius of any true break in the power - law galaxies , we used the following procedure . for each galaxy we fixed @xmath32 at 0.3 , and",
    "@xmath3 at 001 , 002 , ... , respectively .",
    "we then fitted the central 1  to optimize the @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 parameters , and looked for the @xmath3 value at which the @xmath57 of the fit started to rise substantially . for the intermediate - type bcg in abell 1983 we left the previously fitted @xmath3 value ( 01 ) as the upper limit . in cases",
    "where no clear minimum in the @xmath57 value was found , we visually compared the observed surface brightness profiles to nuker - law profiles generated with different @xmath3 values , to estimate the upper limit for @xmath3 .",
    "the upper limits for @xmath3 are tabulated in parenthesis in table  [ t : nukerfits ] .",
    "figure  [ f : gammavsmv ] shows the value of @xmath39 for the bcgs vs.  the absolute galaxy luminosity @xmath58 .",
    "core profiles ( @xmath59 ) exist over nearly the full range of the bcg luminosity function , @xmath60 .",
    "however , power - law ( @xmath61 ) and intermediate - slope ( @xmath62 ) profiles exist only in bcgs with relatively low luminosities , @xmath63 .",
    "power - law galaxies in the sample studied by f97 are depicted by the gray region in the figure .",
    "core galaxies in the f97 sample ( not shown ) fall between the dotted ( at @xmath39 = 0.3 ) and solid ( @xmath39 = 0 ) lines , and between magnitudes @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "f97 summarized their results by concluding that galaxies with @xmath6 have core profiles , galaxies with @xmath66 have power - law profiles , and galaxies with intermediate luminosities can have either type of profile .",
    "our results are in almost perfect agreement with these statements .",
    "the only addition is that we find power - law profiles in galaxies as bright as @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ f : radvsmv ] shows the break radius @xmath3 for the bcgs , in physical units , vs.  the absolute galaxy luminosity @xmath68 .",
    "the area occupied by core - type galaxies in the sample of f97 is also shown ( the region bracketed by dashed lines ) .",
    "as reported previously by , e.g. , kormendy ( 1985 ) , lauer ( 1985 ) , and f97 , there is a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath58 in the sense that lower - luminosity galaxies have smaller break radii .",
    "the bcg sample has more core galaxies at high luminosities than the f97 sample , which has more core galaxies at lower luminosities .",
    "however , in the range of luminosities where they overlap , the samples display a similar range of @xmath3 values .",
    "to quantify this statement we divided the core galaxies in the bcg sample and the non - bcg core galaxies in the f97 sample in two absolute magnitudes bins ( divided at @xmath69 ) .",
    "for each magnitude bin we studied whether the break radius distributions are statistically equivalent .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test showed that the @xmath3 distributions of bcgs and non - bcg ellipticals are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population at better than the 99.95% level .",
    "the willcoxen signed rank test showed differences between the two distributions of @xmath3 values only at the @xmath70 level .",
    "so even though bcgs probably have different accretion histories from elliptical galaxies in general , this is not reflected in their @xmath3 distribution .",
    "while the bcg @xmath71 relationship does agree with that of f97 over their common luminosity range , bcgs allow this relationship to be extended to higher luminosities .",
    "the f97 relationship has the form @xmath1 ( see figure  [ f : radvsmv ] ) , but with large scatter  indeed lauer ( 1985 ) argued that the scatter seen in the ground - based precursor of this relationship indicated that cores were more properly described as a multiparameter family .",
    "figure  [ f : radvsmv ] shows that the most luminous bcgs fall below the extrapolation of the f97 relationship .",
    "a revised fit over the full luminosity range of the f97 and present bcg sample gives a flatter relationship @xmath72 ( figure  [ f : radvsmvfit ] ) .",
    "however , given the large scatter in @xmath3 at all luminosities it is difficult to argue that the @xmath71 relationship has really changed form at high luminosities . also , it is possible that the most luminous bcgs may be due to events that have augmented their envelopes , but that have little to do with their central structure . in this case",
    "their @xmath3 values are really appropriate to less luminous galaxies .    at the distance limit of the sample",
    ", @xmath73 corresponds to @xmath74 .",
    "this scale is indicated in figure  [ f : radvsmv ] .",
    "the large majority of core galaxies are well - resolved at this scale , typically by factors of three or more ( see also figure  [ f : gammavsrad ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the upper limits on the radii of possible breaks in the power - law and intermediate - slope profiles are generally near the resolution limit .",
    "some of the upper limits are very low , indicating that any break radius can at most be a few tens of parsecs , a radius significantly smaller than expected for a core galaxy of a similar luminosity .",
    "this suggests that power - law bcgs are physically different from core - type galaxies .",
    "support for such an interpretation comes from the observation that power - law bcgs on average tend to have lower luminosities than core - type bcgs , and from the clear separation of the power - law galaxies from the horizontal ridge line of the core galaxies in figure  [ f : gammavsmv ] .",
    "similarly , figure  [ f : gammavsrad ] shows that the bcgs outside the core galaxy box are clearly separated from this box .",
    "the failure to find an intermediate - slope bcg ( @xmath75 ) with a well - resolved break shows that such bcgs are rare .",
    "all these considerations provide evidence for a different physical nature of power - law and core - type bcgs .",
    "the location of ngc 1316 ( fornax a ) , a peculiar merging galaxy in the f97 sample , is also plotted in figure  [ f : radvsmv ] .",
    "this galaxy does have a core @xcite , but as f97 emphasized , it is considerably smaller than those in galaxies of similar luminosity , to the extent that it lies well outside the f97 @xmath71 relationship . in figure",
    "[ f : radvsmv ] we see that the core size and luminosity of the bcg in abell 168 are similar to ngc 1316 , while two power - law bcgs , those in abell 261 and abell 2247 , somewhat bridge the luminosity gap between the abell 168  ngc  1316 pair , and the power - law bcgs that conform more closely to the f97 relationship .",
    "ngc 1316 thus appears less as a complete anomaly .",
    "rather , it fits into the bright end of a class of luminous galaxies that have power - law profiles or cores that are substantially smaller than predicted by the f97 @xmath71 relationship .",
    "if binary black holes are responsible for the larger cores that define the @xmath76 relationship , it now becomes interesting to know if any central black holes in the class of power - law or small - core bcgs have unusually low masses , or have been ejected altogether , as we will discuss in section  [ s : disc ] .",
    "it is interesting that we find both core and power - law profiles in our sample of bcg galaxies , given that the sample is quite homogeneous in terms of many other properties . to gain some understanding of this finding , we searched for correlations between the central surface brightness profile classification and other properties of the bcg or its host cluster .",
    "there are seven galaxies in the sample that are classified as having either a power - law profile ( @xmath77 ) or an intermediate - slope profile ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "four of these galaxies show some signs of dust in their _ hst _ image ( see table  [ t : sample ] ) , i.e. , 57% .",
    "this does not differ significantly from the overall prevalence of dust in the sample , which is 39% ( section  [ ss : dust ] ) .",
    "one of the seven galaxies with a power - law or intermediate - slope profile shows morphological evidence for a nuclear stellar disk ( see table  [ t : sample ] and section  [ ss : stardisks ] ) .",
    "the only other galaxy in the sample which may have such a nuclear stellar disk has a core profile . in general ,",
    "nuclear stellar disks are much more common in power - law galaxies than in core galaxies @xcite .",
    "it was originally suggested that the high central surface brightness of power - law galaxies was always the result of the presence of stellar disks seen nearly edge - on @xcite .",
    "however , this was refuted by f97 who argued that power - law galaxies have steeper and higher three - dimensional luminosity densities than core galaxies , independent of whether or not they harbor a stellar disk .",
    "six of the seven galaxies with a power - law or intermediate - slope profile show evidence for multiple nuclei in the _ hst _ image ( see table  [ t : sample ] ) , in the sense defined in section  [ ss : multiple ] .",
    "this exceeds the 40% fraction of the total bcg sample that show evidence for multiple nuclei .",
    "if this were the true underlying probability of finding multiple nuclei , then the probability of finding at least six galaxies with multiple nuclei by chance in a sample of seven is only 2% .",
    "on the other hand , we have not attempted to carefully discriminate between true secondary nuclei , nearby cluster members , and background galaxies .",
    "we are therefore hesitant to attach much weight to this statistic .",
    "none of the seven galaxies with a power - law or intermediate - slope profile have a point - source nucleus ( see table  [ t : sample ] and section  [ ss : pointnuclei ] ) .",
    "however , only seven of the 53 core galaxies have such a point - source nucleus , so the lack of power - law bcgs with a point - source nucleus is not inconsistent with the occurrence fraction in the rest of the sample .",
    "also , there may be a small systematic effect in the sense that point - source nuclei are more difficult to identify in power - law galaxies than in core galaxies .",
    "we have also searched for possible correlations between central surface brightness profile properties and the larger - scale properties of the bcgs and their host clusters .",
    "the quantities that could potentially be interesting in this respect are listed in table  [ t : properties ] .",
    "they include the following : ( a ) the absolute @xmath15-band metric magnitude @xmath78  ( @xmath79 ) of the bcg inside an aperture of @xmath5 radius ; ( b ) the parameter @xmath4 , which measures the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity as a function of radius , determined at a physical radius of 10 kpc ( postman & lauer 1995 ) ; ( c ) the residual between the observed metric luminosity and that predicted by the bcg standard - candle relation between metric luminosity and @xmath4 @xcite ; ( d ) the @xmath80 color ; ( e ) the richness class of the bcg host cluster ; ( f ) the offset of the bcg from the cluster center in projected position ; ( g ) the offset of the bcg from the cluster center in line - of - sight velocity ; ( h ) the morphological classification of the cluster ; ( i ) the velocity dispersion of the cluster ; and ( j ) the x - ray luminosity of the cluster .",
    "we checked for correlations between each of these quantities and the central surface brightness profile classifications obtained from the _ hst _ data ( table  [ t : nukerfits ] ) .",
    "we found a meaningful correlation with only two quantities : @xmath78  ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath4 .",
    "we did not test for a correlation with the cluster elliptical / spiral ratio , because this quantity is not readily available for most of the clusters in our sample .",
    "however , this ratio is known to correlate with the cluster morphological type ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since there is no correlation with the latter , we do not suspect the existence of a correlation between the nuclear cusp slope of a bcg and the elliptical / spiral ratio of the host cluster .",
    "it is no great surprise that there is a correlation between central surface brightness profile classification and metric luminosity @xmath78  ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "after all , we know that there is a correlation with total luminosity ( figure  [ f : gammavsmv ] ) .",
    "we find the correlation with metric luminosity to be very similar .",
    "the power - law bcgs are all at the low - end of the bcg metric luminosity function . only abell 261",
    "has an absolute metric @xmath15-band magnitude that is ( somewhat ) brighter than the sample mean ( which is @xmath78 [ 10 kpc ] = @xmath81 ) .",
    "the correlation between central surface brightness profile classification and the parameter @xmath4 is also not entirely unexpected , because @xmath4 is itself strongly correlated with metric luminosity @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : gammavsalpha ] shows @xmath39 versus @xmath4 .",
    "the seven bcgs that are classified as power - law or intermediate - slope all have relatively small @xmath4 values .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 depends on the slope of the intensity profile at @xmath5 , which corresponds to @xmath36 at the distance limit of our sample .",
    "this exceeds the scale of @xmath73 at which @xmath39 is measured by a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "it also exceeds the break radius of the core galaxies in our bcg sample by a factor of five or more .",
    "the correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath4 therefore has true physical meaning , and is not merely a tautology .",
    "previous studies with _ hst _ demonstrated that very bright elliptical galaxies almost always have core - type brightness profiles .",
    "bcgs are by definition the brightest galaxies in their host clusters , and as a class are known as the brightest galaxies in the universe .",
    "the _ a priori _ expectation for our study was therefore that we would predominantly find core galaxies amongst the bcgs .",
    "indeed , the observations show that core - type profiles exist in 88% of the sample .",
    "this finding is in itself quite important .",
    "it shows that cores are dominant even in the highest luminosity galaxies , which , by the virtue of their central position in galaxy clusters , accrete significantly even at the present epoch .",
    "one can also turn this argument around , and argue that it is actually surprising that we have identified bcgs without core - type profiles .",
    "however , our results are not in contradiction with the trends that have been established previously for samples that were more heavily weighted towards lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "the bcgs with power - law and intermediate - slope profiles all reside at the low end of the bcg luminosity function , as would have been expected on the basis of previous work .",
    "in fact , the bcgs fit almost seamlessly into the previously established trends ; see in particular figure  [ f : gammavsmv ] .",
    "the only novelty is that we find that power - law profiles can occur at somewhat brighter magnitudes than was previously found , up to @xmath58 = -22.6 .",
    "galaxies in general are thought to form through hierarchical accretion of smaller subunits .",
    "this is true in particular for bcgs , which live in environments where the continued infall of smaller subunits is common , even at the present epoch .",
    "semi - analytical models of galaxy formation make explicit predictions for the merging histories of galaxies , as a function of the circular velocity @xmath83 of the halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "bcgs have @xmath84@xmath85 @xcite . for bcgs",
    "this implies that the average time since the last accretion event with a mass ratio larger than 1:10 is 40% of the hubble time .",
    "only @xmath86% of bcgs are expected to not have had such an accretion event for the last 2/3 of a hubble time . from an observational perspective",
    ", it is well known that bcgs are generally more luminous and more extended than elliptical galaxies found in other environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this has been attributed directly to accretion events @xcite . @xcite performed semi - analytical calculations of the evolution of a bcg through accretion events .",
    "as time progresses , the bcg becomes more luminous . at the same time , the radial surface brightness gradients become smaller , which causes @xmath4 to increase .",
    "the most natural interpretation of the observed spread in luminosities and @xmath4 values for bcgs is therefore that different bcgs have undergone different amounts of accretion . in this view , the bcgs with the smallest luminosities and the smallest @xmath4 values are the ones that have had the least pronounced accretion history .",
    "we have found that the central surface brightness profile shapes of bcgs are strongly correlated with both their luminosities ( figure  [ f : gammavsmv ] ) and @xmath4 values ( figure  [ f : gammavsalpha ] ) .",
    "we interpret this as direct evidence that the central surface brightness profile shapes of elliptical galaxies are related to their accretion and merging history .",
    "in particular , our results support scenarios in which elliptical galaxies evolve from power - law profiles to core profiles through accretion and merging .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical investigations of the formation of core galaxies ( e.g. , f97 , @xcite ) . in these studies",
    "most galaxies start out with steep power - law surface brightness profiles ( presumed to be due to any of the physical processes discussed in section  [ s : intro ] ) and a central black hole . as two galaxies merge",
    ", the formation and coalescence of a binary black hole system creates a core - type surface brightness profile @xcite .",
    "more massive galaxies have undergone more accretion events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this causes core - type profiles to be more common amongst the most luminous galaxies .",
    "this scenario also receives support from other arguments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that some high - luminosity galaxies have power - law profiles is not inconsistent with this scenario .",
    "it might be that these galaxies simply have not had a significant accretion event .",
    "merger - tree predictions , such as those presented by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , do not rule this out .",
    "another possibility is that cannibalism has occured during a period when a massive black hole is absent in the center of the high - luminosity accreting galaxy .",
    "the initial generation of a core as a merger endpoint appears to require the formation of a binary black hole as the nuclei of the two merging galaxies are brought together .",
    "if the binary later hardens to the point where its orbital velocities exceed the escape velocity of the merged galaxy , then later accretion of a third black hole may lead to an interaction in which all three black holes are ejected . any dense nucleus cannibalized after this event might then settle into the core of the luminous galaxy without being disrupted .",
    "@xcite have studied the central accretion of massive black holes during the formation of luminous galaxies by hierarchical merging , concluding that in the early stages of galaxy formation , up to 8%  of the three - body black hole interactions may result in all black holes being ejected from the system .",
    "the present small fraction of bcgs with anomalously small cores may be consistent with this scenario .    while the scenario outlined above",
    "naturally explains the existence of core - type profiles in the highest luminosity galaxies , it is less successful in answering another related question : why do we not observe core - type profiles in some galaxies with relatively low luminosities ?",
    "after all , some of these must have had merging and accretion events too .",
    "this suggests that there are mechanisms at work in mergers that prevent the formation of a core under certain circumstances .",
    "one possible explanation is that mergers in low - luminosity galaxies may involve more gaseous dissipation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting star formation could mask the influence of the black hole binary .",
    "there is some evidence for this from the fact that low - luminosity ellipticals tend to be more disky and rotate more rapidly than high - luminosity ellipticals .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that dissipation has been important in their formation ( e.g. , f97 ) .",
    "future color or line strength information would be very useful for testing this scenario by probing the age of the stars in the nucleus .",
    "other possible explanations for the complete absence of core - type profiles in low luminosity galaxies include ( a ) the survival of the stellar nucleus of a small accreted companion , which would then fill in any core that would otherwise have been created by the black hole binary ; and ( b ) the failure of an accreted companion to make its way all the way to the center , so that a black hole binary never forms .",
    "however , the most recent calculations do not favor these scenarios , unless they take place under certain special circumstances @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if these scenarios were correct , it would be unclear why the same processes would not prevent the formation of cores in most of the high luminosity galaxies .",
    "we have presented a study of an unbiased sample of 81 nearby bcgs with an elliptical galaxy morphology . we observed these systems in the @xmath0-band with the _ hst _ wfpc2 camera .",
    "the images show a rich variety of morphological structures : 32 galaxies ( 40% of the sample ) have multiple nuclei or nearby companions ; two galaxies ( 2% ) have a double morphology at the sub - arcsec scale ; 31 galaxies ( 38% of the sample ) show morphological evidence for dust in the form of dust disks , filaments , patches , rings or spirals ; two galaxies ( 2% ) have a circumnuclear morphology that has a high ellipticity , suggesting the possible presence of an edge - on nuclear disk ; ten galaxies ( 12% ) have a point - source nucleus on top of the smooth stellar surface brightness profile , presumably due to non - thermal emission from an agn ; and six galaxies ( 7% ) have a central depression in their surface brightness distribution , possibly due to an actual decrease in the three - dimensional stellar luminosity density .    with the help of isophotal fitting of psf - deconvolved images we determined reliable surface brightness profiles for 60 of the sample galaxies .",
    "the profiles were fitted with the so - called nuker - law parameterization . following previous authors , we classified the surface brightness profiles on the basis of the fit parameters and visual inspection of the profiles .",
    "we identified 53 galaxies ( 88% of the sample ) as `` core '' galaxies ( these have a shallow cusp and a well - defined break ) , six galaxies ( 10% ) as `` power - law '' galaxies ( these have a steep brightness profile all the way into the center ) , and one galaxy ( 2% ) that has an `` intermediate slope . ''",
    "we have studied how the nuker - law fit parameters and the profile classifications relate to the global properties of the bcgs and their host clusters .",
    "we have also compared the results to those obtained previously for other samples of elliptical galaxies , which were more heavily weighted towards low - luminosity objects .",
    "previous studies with _ hst _ demonstrated that bright elliptical galaxies have shallow core - type profiles .",
    "our study underscores this result by showing that cores are dominant even in the highest luminosity galaxies , which by the virtue of their central position in galaxy clusters accrete significantly even at the present epoch .",
    "the finding that 12% of the bcg sample has a power - law or intermediate - slope profile is not in contradiction with earlier work .",
    "the power - law and intermediate - slope bcgs have @xmath63 , which puts them at the low - luminosity end of the bcg luminosity function ( which itself extends to @xmath87 ) .",
    "our results differ from the general rules obtained by f97 only in the sense that we find that power - law profiles can occur in galaxies as bright as @xmath67 .",
    "f97 quoted @xmath88 as the upper limit for the absolute @xmath16-magnitude of the power - law galaxies .",
    "we determined upper limits on the sizes of any potential cores in the power - law and intermediate - slope galaxies in the bcg sample and find these to be much smaller than typical core sizes in core - type galaxies .",
    "combined with the lower luminosity of power - law galaxies and the paucity of intermediate - slope galaxies , our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the power - law galaxies are physically different from core - type galaxies . the type of the central profile ( core vs. power - law ) does not appear to correlate with galaxy distance or morphology , the position or velocity offset from the cluster center , or the velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity , morphology , or richness class of the host cluster . however , there is a significant correlation with the quantity @xmath4 that is used in the standard - candle relations for bcgs .",
    "it measures the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity as a function of radius , at a fixed physical radius ( here chosen to be @xmath5 ) .",
    "bcgs with power - law or intermediate - slope profiles all have relatively low values of @xmath4 .",
    "the connection of the bcg properties , including their central black hole masses , to the bcg radio luminosities and cluster cooling flows will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "these results for bcgs provide important new insight into the physical processes that shape the centers of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we emphasize that the bcgs form a very homogeneous population of galaxies that presumably had very similar formation and evolutionary histories . given their positions in the centers of prominent clusters , accretion and merging",
    "must have played an important part in their evolution .",
    "growth by accretion and merging provides a natural explanation for their unusually extended envelopes .",
    "theoretical calculations have shown that the luminosities and @xmath4 values of bcgs grow as a result of accretion .",
    "this suggests that bcgs with low luminosities and low @xmath4 values have had the least pronounced accretion histories .",
    "our observations show that these are the galaxies that are most likely to have power - law profiles .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that elliptical galaxies evolve from power - law profiles to core - profiles through accretion and merging .",
    "such a morphological evolution can be naturally explained by theoretical studies where the merging progenitors both have central black holes .",
    "after the progenitor galaxies have merged , the black holes form a central binary that ejects stars from the central region , giving rise to a central core with a shallow cusp .",
    "the massive black holes serve to both create and protect cores in the centers of luminous ellipticals .",

    "<S> we used the _ hst _ wfpc2 to obtain @xmath0-band images of the centers of 81 brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , drawn from a volume - limited sample of nearby bcgs . </S>",
    "<S> the images show a rich variety of morphological features , including multiple or double nuclei , dust , stellar disks , point source nuclei , and central surface brightness depressions . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution surface brightness profiles could be inferred for 60 galaxies . of those , </S>",
    "<S> 88%  have well - resolved cores . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between core size and galaxy luminosity for bcgs is indistinguishable from that of @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter f97 ) for galaxies within the same luminosity range . </S>",
    "<S> however , the core sizes of the most luminous bcgs fall below the extrapolation of the f97 relationship @xmath1 . a shallower relationship @xmath2 fits both the bcgs and the core galaxies presented in f97 . </S>",
    "<S> twelve percent of the bcg sample lacks a well - resolved core ; all but one of these bcgs have `` power - law '' profiles . some of these galaxies have higher luminosities than any power - law galaxy identified by f97 and have physical upper limits on @xmath3 well below the values observed for core galaxies of the same luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> these results support the idea that the central structure of early - type galaxies is bimodal in its physical properties , but also suggest that there exist high luminosity galaxies with power - law profiles ( or unusually small cores ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bcgs in the latter category tend to fall at the low end of the bcg luminosity function and tend to have low values of the quantity @xmath4 ( the logarithmic slope of the metric luminosity as a function of radius , at @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since theoretical calculations have shown that the luminosities and @xmath4 values of bcgs grow with time as a result of accretion , this suggests a scenario in which elliptical galaxies evolve from power - law profiles to core profiles through accretion and merging . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with theoretical scenarios that invoke the formation of massive black hole binaries during merger events . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the prevalence of large cores in the great majority of bcgs , which are likely to have experienced several generations of galaxy merging , underscores the role of a mechanism that creates and preserves cores in such merging events . </S>"
