    "there has been a recent revival of interest in processes mediated via photons at @xmath5 colliders@xcite . in the present work",
    "we address the question of photon induced production processes at hadron colliders , which have been relatively neglected . since photons have a universal coupling to charged fermions it seems natural to consider fermion pair production as a benchmark process .",
    "heavy charged leptons are a feature of many models which extend the particle content of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these include models which propose a complete additional generation@xcite of heavy quarks and leptons , as well as those like @xmath6 based superstring - inspired models@xcite , which contain extra particles within each generation .",
    "the drell - yan@xcite , gluon fusion @xcite , and weak gauge boson fusion@xcite mechanisms for the production of heavy charged leptons in hadron collisions have been investigated in the past .",
    "we here consider heavy charged lepton pair production in hadronic collisions via two photon ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 fusion . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the feynman diagrams for the relevant subprocesses .",
    "we assume standard model couplings for both the @xmath7 and the @xmath0 boson to the heavy leptons , @xmath8 .",
    "the inelastic process @xmath9 ( where the photons come from the quarks ) , the elastic process @xmath10 ( where the photons come from the protons ) , and the semi - elastic process @xmath11 , are considered in a weizscker - williams approximation@xcite ( wwa ) .",
    "we have previously presented some results for these photon fusion processes@xcite , as have some other authors @xcite .",
    "the inelastic @xmath12 process was considered on its own by eboli _",
    "et al._@xcite also .    here , we also present heavy charged lepton pair production via @xmath3 fusion . in fact , the @xmath3 fusion process yields a larger production cross section than the @xmath2 fusion over most of the lepton mass range we consider ( @xmath13 of 100 - 700 @xmath14 ) .",
    "our @xmath3 fusion calculation is done within the framework of an effective vector boson approximation@xcite , for both inelastic and semi - elastic @xmath4 collisions .",
    "heavy charged lepton production via @xmath15 fusion has been previously considered for the case of inelastic @xmath4 collisions by eboli _",
    "et al._@xcite we do not agree with their results and discuss the origin of that discrepancy .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe in sec .",
    "2 the details of the effective photon and effective @xmath0 approximations which we have used .",
    "the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) luminosities in @xmath4 collisions are presented in sec",
    ". 3 ; these results are of broader interest than just for the particular heavy lepton production considered here .",
    "the @xmath1 production cross sections are presented in sec . 4 and we summarize in the final section .",
    "the central idea of the effective photon or weizscker - williams approximation@xcite is to approximate the scattering cross - section involving a charged particle by a convolution of the equivalent number of photons in that particle with the relevant photoproduction cross - section .",
    "the quark - parton model has been very successful in describing hadronic interactions at high energies . for inelastic @xmath4 scattering a proton",
    "may be regarded essentially as a collection of freely travelling elementary constituent quarks and gluons .",
    "the weizscker - williams photon spectrum , @xmath18 , from a quark ( of charge @xmath19 ) is given by@xcite @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the fraction of the quark energy carried off by the photon . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the characteristic maximum and minimum photon momentum transfers . for the process under consideration ,",
    "pair production of heavy charged leptons of mass @xmath13 , we have taken these to be @xmath24 , and @xmath25 @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the center of mass energy in the parton frame . there is some flexibility in the choice of @xmath22 .",
    "however , in agreement with altarelli _ et .",
    "al._@xcite , we have found that our results are not very sensitive to this parameter , within the limits of the weizscker - williams approximation .",
    "the particular choice of the minimum momentum transfer , @xmath23 , guarantees that the photons are obtained from the deep inelastic scattering of protons , when the quark - parton model is valid .    for inelastic scattering",
    "the incident proton ceases to exist and the constituents hadronize .",
    "however for elastic @xmath4 scattering the incident protons remain intact .",
    "the photon spectrum from protons for the elastic case , @xmath28 , has been derived by kniehl@xcite in a modified weizscker - williams approximation .",

    "@xmath34    the form factors are parametrized as    @xmath35    using these parametrizations kniehl has obtained a closed analytic expression@xcite for @xmath36 , which we have used in our calculation .    for hadron interactions at very high energies in the multi - tev range",
    ", one can consider the @xmath37 and @xmath0 bosons also as constituents of protons .",
    "in analogy with the effective photon approximation , effective vector boson approximations have been developed which considerably simplify calculations involving gauge bosons .",
    "however unlike photons , a massive gauge boson has both transverse and longitudinal polarizations and these degrees of freedom must be treated separately .",
    "the effective @xmath37 and @xmath0 approximations give the spectra of longitudinally and transversely polarized @xmath37 s and @xmath0 s from quarks in the protons .",
    "we have done our calculations using two different forms for the effective @xmath0 approximation , the non - leading order z distributions of dawson @xcite and those of johnson _ et . al._@xcite . in the original formulation of the approximation ,",
    "dawson @xcite presents the distribution function of @xmath0 bosons in quarks both in the leading logarithmic ( ll ) approximation and also gives non - leading order corrections up to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the quark energy .",
    "we used the non - leading order distribution in our calculation .",
    "an improved formulation of the effective vector boson approximation has been presented by johnson _ et .",
    "this formulation does not invoke any kinematic approximations made in the original formulation , and claims to improve the accuracy and extend the range of applicability of the effective vector boson approximation@xcite .",
    "dawson presents the distribution of transverse z bosons averaged over the two transverse polarizations whereas johnson _ et .",
    "derive separately each of the positive and negative helicity polarizations .",
    "the distribution expressions are too lengthy to reproduce here @xcite .",
    "johnson _ et .",
    "_ , in comparing their vector boson distribution functions with that of the leading logarithmic ( ll ) distribution functions of dawson , find the ll expressions to be a considerable overestimate , particularly for small @xmath21 and for the transverse polarization .",
    "we here find rather good agreement between our @xmath15 luminosity results using the distribution functions of dawson including non - leading order corrections and those of johnson _ et .",
    ", as we show in the next section .",
    "using the effective photon and @xmath0 approximations described above we present here the two photon and @xmath0-photon differential luminosities in @xmath4 collisions as a function of @xmath40 ( the ratio of the @xmath41 subprocess energy and the total @xmath4 energy ) , for the inelastic , elastic and semi - elastic cases .",

    "@xmath47 an analytic expression can be obtained for the subprocess differential luminosity as    @xmath48    no such simple analytic expression is available for the case @xmath49 using non - leading order @xmath0 distribution functions .    the @xmath2 differential luminosity for elastic @xmath4 collisions is given by ,    @xmath50    where the upper limit of integration is given by kinematical considerations to be @xmath51 ,",

    "2 , @xmath55 luminosities derived with the non - leading dawson effective @xmath0 approximation in fig . 3 , and @xmath3 luminosities derived with the johnson _ et . al .",
    "_ effective @xmath0 distributions in fig .",
    "we consider these results in turn below .",
    "the luminosity for the elastic case is independent of the production process , however for the other two cases it depends on the production process through the factor @xmath22 . in each figure , the luminosities for inelastic and semi - elastic cases are presented for the case of charged lepton mass @xmath56 @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the inelastic , elastic , and semi - elastic two photon luminosities in @xmath4 collisions for the proposed cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) of center of mass energy of 14 tev . for comparison purposes",
    "we also show the two gluon luminosity . as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 the @xmath2 luminosities are comparable for the three cases but are , however , 3 - 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath57 luminosity .",
    "this can be understood as being due to the fact that the photon luminosities are suppressed by a factor @xmath58 with respect to the gluon luminosity , which is somewhat countered by the logarithmic enhancement factor present in the photon luminosities .    in figs .",
    "3 a , b we show the @xmath3 differential luminosities for inelastic and semi - elastic @xmath4 collisions , respectively , using the non - leading dawson form of the effective @xmath0 approximation .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the luminosity for longitudinally polarized @xmath0 bosons , the dot - dashed line to the average over the two transverse polarizations of the @xmath0 .",
    "the luminosity corresponding to transversely polarized @xmath0 dominates that for longitudinal @xmath0 polarizations .",
    "this may be understood as being due to helicity suppression .",
    "for both the inelastic and semi - elastic cases , the @xmath59 differential luminosity is larger than the @xmath60 differential luminosity by a factor of 2 - 3 for @xmath61 and by an order of magnitude for @xmath62 . ultimately , however , we will see that the @xmath63 cross - section dominates so it is most important to consider the luminosity for longitudinal @xmath0 bosons here",
    ". comparing the inelastic and semi - elastic cases , the total differential @xmath3 luminosity for the inelastic case is larger than that for the semi - elastic case by a factor of 2 - 3 for @xmath61 , but for @xmath64 they become equal .    in figs .",
    "4 a , b we show the results for the @xmath3 differential luminosities , for inelastic and semi - elastic @xmath4 collisions , respectively , using the johnson form of the effective @xmath0 approximation . here , again , the solid line shows the luminosity for longitudinally polarized @xmath0 bosons .",
    "the dot - dashed and dotted lines show separately the luminosities for positive and negative helicity transverse z polarizations , respectively .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the sum of the luminosities for the two transverse z polarizations , which we will refer to as @xmath65 as in the dawson case .",
    "one observes essentially the same numerical relationships between the different luminosities shown here , as discussed above for the dawson form of the effective @xmath0 approximation .",
    "the @xmath60 luminosities agree almost exactly for the two different forms of the effective @xmath0 approximation , except at very small @xmath40 .",
    "the johnson distribution functions yield @xmath59 luminosities slightly larger than those obtained with the dawson distribution functions .",
    "we will find that the @xmath3 process cross section is only large enough to be interesting for heavy lepton masses above about 600 @xmath14 ; in the range of @xmath40 corresponding to production of such heavy leptons the dawson and johnson luminosities for @xmath65 agree to 20 % or better . in both the longitudinal and transverse cases",
    ", one does expect some disagreement between the dawson and johnson formulations . while they are both non - leading distribution functions , they are derived under quite different kinematical assumptions",
    "; the dawson derivation includes approximations , such as the small - angle one , which the johnson derivation does not .",
    "in addition , for the transverse @xmath0 polarizations , the johnson formulation separately extracts the positive and negative @xmath0 helicity distribution functions whereas the dawson formulation extracts a single transverse @xmath0 distribution function from the cross sections averaged over the two transverse polarizations .",
    "so , particularly in the transverse case , the agreement should not be perfect .",
    "we have shown in figs . 3 and 4 a detailed comparison of the luminosities using the two forms of the effective @xmath0 approximation .",
    "we will present the production cross - sections for @xmath15 fusion using only the non - leading order dawson form of the effective @xmath0 approximation in the next section .",
    "this choice is really rather arbitrary . for the longitudinal @xmath0 case , which will be of interest ,",
    "agreement between the two formulations is excellent .    comparing the two different initiating states , we find that the @xmath3 luminosities are smaller than the @xmath2 luminosities for small values of @xmath40 , but they do not differ by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "for @xmath66 the @xmath3 and @xmath2 luminosities are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the matrix elements and cross - sections for the relevant subprocesses , @xmath67 , are given in the appendix .",
    "the total cross - sections are obtained by convoluting the subprocess cross sections with the appropriate photon ( and/or @xmath0 ) and quark structure functions and integrating over the two body phase space using monte carlo techniques .",
    "the cross - section for the @xmath16 production of a pair of heavy charged leptons in inelastic @xmath4 collisions ( with center of mass energy @xmath52 ) is obtained by convoluting the cross - section of the @xmath68 subprocess , @xmath69 , with the probabilities of finding the gauge bosons in the protons as follows .",
    "@xmath70    here @xmath71 represents either a photon or a longitudinal or transverse degree of freedom of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the inelastic component of the @xmath71 spectrum from protons , @xmath72 , is given by    @xmath73    in the above equation , the @xmath74 represent the quark structure functions for the proton@xcite , evaluated at the scale @xmath75 , @xmath27 being the parton center of mass energy squared .",
    "we sum over the contributions due to the @xmath76 , and @xmath77 quarks and antiquarks from the protons .",
    "the lower limit of integration in the above equations ensures that the @xmath16 center of mass energy is sufficient for @xmath1 production .",
    "the cross - section for two photon @xmath1 production via elastic collisions of protons is obtained by folding the @xmath2 subprocess cross - section , @xmath78 , with the elastic component of the photon spectrum from the protons , @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80    the upper limits of integration in the above expression are given by @xmath81 , where @xmath52 is the center of mass energy of the elastically colliding protons .",
    "the lower limit of integration @xmath82 has the same significance as in the case of inelastic collisions .",
    "we have checked this calculation by using an alternative form of the photon spectrum from elastically colliding protons@xcite .",
    "the cross sections obtained with this alternative form essentially agree with the results presented here using the kniehl form of wwa .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath1 production via semi - elastic collisions of protons , induced by @xmath2 and @xmath3 are obtained in a similar fashion by appropriately combining the two cases detailed above .    for comparison with the mechanisms considered here , we also present results for the two previously well known production mechanisms for @xmath1 , drell - yan and gluon fusion .",
    "the drell - yan quark anti - quark annihilation proceeds via s - channel @xmath7 and @xmath0 exchange .",
    "the gluon fusion proceeds via a quark triangle diagram followed by @xmath0 boson or higgs boson exchange .",
    "expressions for these cross sections can be found in the literature@xcite .",
    "the rates for the other possible processes of weak gauge boson fusion and annihilation are negligible compared to the drell - yan and gluon fusion rates except for the case of very massive heavy leptons , @xcite and will not be discussed further .",
    "in our calculations we use @xmath83 @xmath14 , @xmath84 @xmath14 . in calculating the two photon production cross - sections we have taken into account the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath85 with the energy scale , _",
    "e.g. _ , we have chosen @xmath86 in the expressions for weizscker - williams photon spectrum , and @xmath87 in the expressions for the subprocess cross - sections .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 , used in the gluon fusion calculation , is evaluated at the two - loop level using its representation in the modified minimal - subtraction @xmath89 scheme@xcite , and using the value @xmath90 @xmath14 , consistent with the hmrs ( set b ) parametrization . for the gluon fusion mechanism",
    "we assume three generations of quarks , with the top quark mass set at 175 @xmath14 .",
    "results for the inclusion of a fourth generation of heavy quarks can be found in refs . 2 , 19 .",
    "the higgs boson mass for our calculation is chosen to be 200 @xmath14 .",
    "there is very little sensitivity to this parameter .",
    "the total cross sections for @xmath1 production via two photon fusion as a function of the charged lepton mass , are shown in fig . 5 for the lhc center of mass energy of 14 tev .",
    "the dotted and upper solid curves represent respectively the cross sections due to gluon fusion and drell - yan mechanisms .",
    "the lower solid curve represents the total cross section for the inelastic process @xmath91 .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed curves show the corresponding cross- sections for the elastic and semi - elastic cases respectively .",
    "the cross- sections for the three cases are comparable to each other over the mass range of the charged lepton .",
    "however they are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the drell - yan and gluon fusion cross sections .",
    "hence in general , production rates via two photon fusion at @xmath4 colliders are not competitive with production via quark or gluon fusion .",
    "only the interesting event topology of particle production through photon fusion for elastic and semi - elastic @xmath4 collisions might offer a chance of distinguishing signals which are otherwise very difficult in a hadronically noisier environment .",
    "both the elastic and semi - elastic processes should yield clean events with the intact proton(s ) continuing in the forward direction .",
    "however , the low event rates probably eliminate this as a viable process for @xmath1 discovery .",
    "two recent publications@xcite address similar topics for two photon processes as discussed here , and reach essentially the same conclusions .",
    "_ point out the additional problem of multiple events at high luminosity ; thus , the high luminosity necessary to achieve an interesting rate will destroy the cleanliness of the signal .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath1 production via @xmath3 fusion . in the appendix , we present the matrix element squared for the @xmath3 subprocess , without summing over the @xmath0 boson polarization .",
    "this allows us to obtain separately the contributions from longitudinally and transversely polarized @xmath0 bosons .",
    "we also give an expression for the subprocess cross - section summed over @xmath0 boson polarizations in the appendix .    for subprocess energies much greater than the @xmath0 boson mass",
    "the interactions between the longitudinally polarized @xmath0 boson and fermions can be derived in terms of an effective theory@xcite in which @xmath92 is the would be goldstone boson of the broken @xmath93 model .",
    "calculations are greatly simplified in the effective theory since the vector bosons are replaced by scalar bosons .",
    "hence as an additional check on our exact calculation we have calculated the cross - section for the subprocess @xmath63 in the goldstone boson approximation .",
    "the subprocess cross - section for longitudinal @xmath0 bosons dominates since the coupling of fermions to longitudinally polarized @xmath0 bosons is proportional to the large fermion mass in the effective lagrangian , as given by dawson@xcite    @xmath94    here @xmath95 indicates the heavy charged lepton wave function and @xmath92 that of the goldstone boson .",
    "the subprocess cross - section is given in the appendix .",
    "indeed we find good agreement between this approximate calculation and our results obtained from the exact calculation .    in figs .",
    "6 a , b we show respectively the @xmath1 production cross - sections via @xmath3 fusion at the lhc for inelastic and semi - elastic @xmath4 collisions .",
    "we have used the non - leading dawson form of the @xmath0 distribution function . for reference ,",
    "the cross sections due to gluon fusion and drell - yan mechanisms are again shown as the dotted and upper solid curves , respectively .",
    "the dashed and dot - dashed curves represent , respectively , the separate contributions of longitudinally and transversely polarized @xmath0 bosons .",
    "the solid curve is the total cross section .",
    "the @xmath96 cross - section is smaller than that for @xmath60 and also decreases more rapidly with increasing @xmath13 . for small values of @xmath13",
    "the cross - sections for semi - elastic @xmath4 collisions are smaller than those for inelastic collisions , but they become approximately equal for @xmath97 @xmath14 .",
    "our results for @xmath15 production of heavy charged lepton are in disagreement with those of eboli _",
    "et al._@xcite those authors consider inelastic @xmath3 production in @xmath4 collisions using the leading logarithmic result for the effective @xmath0 approximation , and using the goldstone boson approximation for the subprocess cross - section . however , as has been pointed out in ref .",
    "6 , they have chosen the @xmath98 coupling to quarks in the effective lagrangian to be proportional to the vector coupling of @xmath0 bosons to quarks , whereas it should be proportional to the axial vector coupling .",
    "they find the transversely polarized @xmath0 boson cross - sections dominating the longitudinally polarized @xmath0 boson cross - section . while we agree that the @xmath99 luminosity is larger than that for @xmath100",
    ", we find that the @xmath63 cross - section dominates .",
    "as noted above we have good agreement between our exact calculation and the goldstone boson approximation calculation for the @xmath100 subprocess .",
    "one can see that the @xmath3 inelastic cross - sections are comparable to the @xmath2 inelastic cross - sections for small values of @xmath13 .",
    "however the @xmath2 fusion cross - section falls off much more rapidly with increasing @xmath13 compared to the @xmath3 fusion cross - section , and for larger values of @xmath13 the @xmath3 cross - section is an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath2 cross - section .",
    "one may intuitively understand the relative magnitudes of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross - sections as follows .",
    "the ratio of the subprocess cross - sections for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the same subprocess center of mass energy ( i.e. same @xmath40 ) is almost independent of @xmath40 but depends only on @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath3 subprocess cross - section is approximately an order of magnitude larger than that for @xmath2 for @xmath103 @xmath14 and is about two orders of magnitude larger for @xmath104 @xmath14 . since the @xmath3 differential luminosities in @xmath4 collisions are about an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath12 differential luminosities for small @xmath40 , and approximately equal for @xmath66 , the relative magnitudes of the total cross - sections obtained in @xmath4 collisions follow .",
    "the result is that each of the inelastic and semi - elastic @xmath3 production cross sections for @xmath1 is within about an order of magnitude of the drell - yan and gluon fusion cross sections for large values of @xmath105 , beyond @xmath105 about 500 @xmath14 in the inelastic case and somewhat higher in the semi - elastic case . for these large lepton masses ,",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath3 processes are down at the tenths of a fb level , so high luminosity is again important .",
    "a one year integrated luminosity of 100 @xmath106 provides about 20 pairs of 600 @xmath14 leptons for each of the inelastic and semi - elastic mechanisms .",
    "we now discuss qualititatively the possible signatures for @xmath1 pair production at @xmath4 colliders via @xmath15 fusion and their potential backgrounds . we have discussed the production of @xmath1 so far in a relatively model - independent fashion .",
    "the production cross - sections for heavy charged leptons that are predicted within a large variety of models , are either given directly by the cross - section results presented here or can be obtained by a simple rescaling of these results .",
    "the decays for heavy charged leptons and their possible signatures depend however on other extra particles predicted within the model .",
    "thus a model independent discussion of the observability of @xmath1 pairs is not possible .",
    "previous work on detailed analysis of @xmath1 signal and backgrounds by barger _",
    "_ @xcite and i. hinchliffe@xcite assumed a sequential ( 4th generation ) charged heavy lepton and its associated neutrino @xmath107 .",
    "for simplicity we consider the same model here in our discussion of the possible signatures .",
    "depending on the decay mode of charged heavy leptons there can be three possible signatures which we discuss in turn .",
    "if both charged heavy leptons decay leptonically , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath108 , @xmath109 @xmath110 , the signature would be an @xmath5 , or @xmath111 , or @xmath112 pair and missing transverse momentum .",
    "the sm backgrounds in this case are : ( a ) @xmath113 ( b ) @xmath114 ( c ) @xmath115 ( d ) @xmath116 where the gauge bosons and @xmath40 leptons themselves decay leptonically .",
    "there are also additional backgrounds to be considered , the two - photon fusion processes at @xmath4 colliders , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "if one heavy lepton decays leptonically and the other hadronically , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath120 , the final state consists of an electron or muon , missing @xmath121 and jets .",
    "the sm backgrounds for this signature are : ( a ) @xmath122 jets ( b ) @xmath114 ( c ) @xmath123 , and the process @xmath124 , where for the cases of @xmath37 pair production , one @xmath37 boson of the pair decays leptonically and the other hadronically .",
    "if both charged heavy leptons decay hadronically the signature is 4 jets and missing @xmath121 .",
    "the sm background in this case is @xmath125 4 jets , with @xmath126 .",
    "detailed monte - carlo simulations of the signals and backgrounds for these decay modes of @xmath8 , but corresponding to a different production mode , in inelastic @xmath4 collisions , have been reported previously@xcite .",
    "for the semi - elastic @xmath3 fusion case , the signals corresponding to the various decay modes of @xmath8 considered above would include the additional tag of a single proton . in principle the unique topology of the semi - elastic @xmath3 events could be exploited to observe the signal , for example by using forward spectrometers .",
    "the results presented here are intended as an exploratory survey of the novel signatures that occur in photon and @xmath0 induced fusion processes at hadron colliders .",
    "detailed confirmation of the observability of these signatures would require monte - carlo simulations of the signals and backgrounds , including considering the detector acceptance , and effects such as overlapping events at high luminosities .",
    "we have evaluated the importance of hadron colliders as a source of @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions by considering the production of charged heavy leptons in such colliders . while we have used the pair production of charged heavy leptons as a benchmark process , some of our results are of broader interest . in particular , we have presented @xmath2 and @xmath55 luminosities for inelastic , elastic , and semi - elastic @xmath4 scattering .",
    "the luminosities for longitudinally and transversely polarized @xmath0 bosons were given separately .",
    "these results can be used for the consideration of the production of other final states via the @xmath2 and @xmath3 initiating subprocesses .",
    "our conclusions with respect to the two photon induced heavy lepton production are rather pessimistic , consistent with drees _ et al .",
    "the total event rates for @xmath2 induced processes are not competitive with other dominant production mechanisms , being down by a couple orders of magnitude . the novel mechanism of obtaining photons without one or both of the protons breaking up could , in principle , prove useful in confirming signals which are difficult to otherwise distinguish . however , the @xmath2 cross sections are probably too suppressed to exploit the topology of the elastic events .    on the other hand , we find that @xmath3 production of heavy charged leptons overtakes @xmath2 production for lepton masses above 100 @xmath14 .",
    "it rises to within about an order of magnitude of the dominating drell - yan and gluon fusion processes for @xmath13 of about 600 @xmath14 .",
    "this is the same sort of behaviour as seen in higgs boson production via the gluon and vector boson fusion mechanisms , where the vector boson fusion cross - section ultimately overtakes the gluon fusion cross - section for large higgs mass@xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath55 initiated processes should not be neglected .",
