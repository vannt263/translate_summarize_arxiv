    "the quasar , at a redshift 0.388 , shows two broad - line emission systems separated in velocity by 3500 km  s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this unique quasar is interpreted as a binary black - hole system with a separation of 0.1 pc and masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the sub - parsec scale is significant , as it suggests that this close binary system shares a common narrow - line emission region and has also solved its so - called final parsec problem . for the assumed flat cosmology  km  s@xmath0  mpc@xmath0 and @xmath3 , implying a luminosity distance of 2.1 gpc , an angular size distance of 1.1 gpc and a scale of 5.2 kpc per arc sec . ] , the 0.1-pc binary subtends 0.02 mas .",
    "an alternative interpretation for sdss j153636.22 + 044127.0 ( sdss j1536 + 0441 hereafter ) is that it represents two unrelated quasars viewed , by chance , along similar sight lines .",
    "@xcite use the optical localization region - a circle of radius 1 - to rule out this alternative interpretation with a probability of 0.0032 .",
    "new high quality spectroscopy by @xcite revealed a broad feature redshifted by 3500 - 4500 km  s@xmath0 in h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 , which raises a third option that sdss j1536 + 0441 is a `` double peaked emitter '' ( dpe ) , such as seen in arp102b @xcite and 3c390.3 @xcite .",
    "the peculiar emission profile in dpe may originate from a thin keplerian gaseous disk ( also proposed for sdss j1536 + 0441 by gaskell [ 2009 ] ) .",
    "as noted by @xcite , dpe show two broad components of comparable strength , unlike seen here .",
    "it is clearly important to observe this quasar with sub - arcsecond resolution , for two reasons .",
    "first , the 0.1-pc binary hypothesis can be ruled out if two widely - separated sources are detected .",
    "second , if observations with sub - arcsecond resolution detect only a single source , then the random - projection estimate would drop below 0.0032 , serving to strengthen the 0.1-pc binary hypothesis .",
    "sdss j1536 + 0441 is not detected in 1.4-ghz sky surveys , so its flux density is less than 1 mjy at 5 resolution @xcite and less than 2.5 mjy at 45 resolution @xcite . following @xcite , combining the 1 mjy upper limit at 1.4 ghz with the @xmath6-band magnitude @xcite means that sdss j1536 + 0441 has a radio - to - optical ratio less than unity , implying that it is a radio - quiet quasar .",
    "fortunately , such a classification does not exclude it from being detected at radio frequencies and observed with sub - arcsecond resolution .",
    "  [ data ] of this _ letter _ reports new vla @xcite imaging of sdss j1536 + 0441 at sub - arcsecond resolution , leading to the discovery of two sources separated by 0.97 ( 5.1 kpc ) .",
    "the implications of this discovery are explored in   [ implications ] .",
    "  [ summary ] closes with a summary of this work and suggestions for future directions .",
    "the b configuration of the vla was used , under proposal code al738 , to observe sdss j1536 + 0441 near transit on ut 2009 february 17 and 20 .",
    "observations were phase - referenced to the calibrator j1534 + 0131 whose positional accuracy was less than 2 mas .",
    "the switching angle was 3 and the switching time was 280  s. the center frequency was 8.4601  ghz , abbreviated as 8.5  ghz hereafter .",
    "the _ a priori _ pointing position for the quasar was centered 3 north of the sdss name - derived position to avoid any phase - center artifacts .",
    "observations were made assuming a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "data were acquired with a bandwidth of 100  mhz for each circular polarization .",
    "observations of 3c286 were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 3% .",
    "the net exposure times for sdss j1536 + 0441 were 6020  s and 6080  s on 2009 february 17 and 20 , respectively .",
    "twenty - five antennas provided data of acceptable quality .    the data were calibrated using the 2009 dec 31 release of the nrao aips software . no polarization calibration or self - calibrations",
    "were performed .",
    "after calibration , each day s visibility data for sdss j1536 + 0441 were concatenated .",
    "the aips task imagr was applied to the concatenated data to form and deconvolve images of the stokes @xmath7 emission .",
    "a variety of weighting schemes were applied to the visibility data , converging on the image given in figure  1 that optimizes the balance between sensitivity and resolution .",
    "figure  1 shows two radio sources , labeled vla - a and vla - b .",
    "elliptical - gaussian fits to those sources in the image plane yielded the following integrated flux densities , positions , and 1-dimensional position errors : for vla - a , @xmath8  mjy , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ; for vla - b , @xmath12  mjy , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . for each source ,",
    "the flux - density error is the quadratic sum of the 3% scale error and the fit residual , while the position error is the quadratic sum of a term due to the phase - calibrator position error ( less than 0.002 ) , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) ( less than 0.02 ) , and the phase - referencing strategies ( estimated to be 0.1 ) .",
    "the image fits indicated that each source was unresolved and , given the high s / n data , this was taken to imply a diameter of less than 0.37 , corresponding to half of the geometric - mean beam width at fwhm quoted in figure  1 .",
    "sources vla - a and vla - b have a summed flux density of @xmath16  mjy .",
    "the image fits also yielded a relative source separation of 0.97 @xmath17 0.03 .",
    "from the new vla data , the 8.5-ghz emission from sdss j1536 + 0441 consists of two sources , vla - a and vla - b , with radio luminosities , @xmath18 , at 8.5 ghz of @xmath19  ergs  s@xmath0 and @xmath20  ergs  s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "each source is unresolved , with a diameter of less than 0.37 ( 1.9 kpc ) and , as figure  1 shows , lies within the quasar s optical localization region @xcite .",
    "vla - a and vla - b are separated by 0.97 ( 5.1 kpc ) .",
    "these could be two related radio sources , both energized by the candidate 0.1-pc binary system .",
    "alternatively , vla - a and vla - b could be independent radio sources originating from a binary quasar system , with a projected separation of 5.1 kpc .",
    "the implications of these two interpretations are explored separately below in   [ related ] and   [ unrelated ] . as mentioned in ",
    "[ motivation ] , sdss j1536 + 0441 is a radio - quiet quasar as defined by @xcite , and its properties will be analyzed within that context . finally , in   [ coronal ] the available data for sdss j1536 + 0441",
    "will be used to explore a specific framework for radio - quiet quasars recently proposed by @xcite .      the radio emission from vla",
    "- a and vla - b could represent two related sources , with a projected separation of 0.97 ( 5.1 kpc ) and with both radio sources ultimately being energized by the candidate 0.1-pc binary .",
    "when imaged at sub - arcsecond resolution , other radio - quiet quasars at similar redshifts and luminosities are known to exhibit double , triple , and linear radio structures on scales of a few kiloparsecs @xcite , making a radio - double scenario plausible for j1536 + 0441 .",
    "if either vla - a or vla - b coincide with the energizing 0.1-pc binary , then the localization of that binary could be improved from the optical diameter of 2 @xcite to the radio diameter of less than 0.37 . however , by analogy with the @xcite radio doubles with accurate optical astrometry , the 0.1-pc binary in j1536 + 0441 could be located between vla - a and vla - b .",
    "therefore a conservative value for the radio localization area is a region extending about 1 east - west and less than 0.8 north - south ( the major axis of the gaussian restoring beam ) , leading to a radio localization area of less than 0.8 arcsec@xmath21 .",
    "the area of the optical localization region is 3.1 arcsec@xmath21 @xcite , so the new 8.5-ghz imaging has improved the localization by a factor of at least 3.9 .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ motivation ] , sdss j1536 + 0441 was less than 1 mjy at 1.4 ghz at 5 resolution @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the summed flux density for vla - a and vla - b is @xmath16  mjy at 8.5 ghz (   [ data ] ) . comparing these values",
    "suggests that the overall spectral index for sdss j1536 + 0441 is flat , or even rising , with frequency .",
    "this could indicate that vla - a , the stronger of the two 8.5-ghz sources , is sufficiently compact to be synchrotron self - absorbed and thus resemble components in some other radio - quiet quasars @xcite .",
    "such compact emission could also hint that vla - a marks the location of the candidate 0.1-pc binary , implying an even smaller radio localization for it and also strengthening its similarities to the radio galaxy 0402 + 379 that hosts a 7-pc binary @xcite .",
    "some radio - quiet quasars do exhibit time variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so this inference of a flat or rising overall spectrum for vla - a is weakened by not having simultaneous measurements at 1.4 and 8.5 ghz .",
    "but if the spectral index estimate is inexact due to variability on a decade timescale then , from causality arguments , the inference about small - scale radio emission still stands .",
    "the detection of two point sources at radio frequencies also raises the possibility that the emission originates from two quasars 0.97 apart , or at a projected separation of 5.1 kpc .",
    "@xcite noted that the probability for such a random projection in their sample is 0.0032 .",
    "therefore , the two quasars are most likely not due to a random projection , but are likely physically related , i.e. a binary quasar system .",
    "a remarkable radio - loud case of a binary system of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is seen in 3c75 , where two systems of two - sided jets emanate from two close point sources with a projected separation of @xmath22  kpc @xcite .",
    "compact binary agns were also revealed with _",
    "observations of nearby systems .",
    "particularly clear cases are ngc6240 with a @xmath23  kpc separation @xcite , and mrk463 with a @xmath24  kpc separation @xcite .",
    "thus , sdss j1536 + 0441 may be another example of a compact binary agn system .",
    "a systematic study of the abundance of binary quasars in the sdss was carried out by @xcite , who found a projected correlation function of the form @xmath25 on scales of 1040  kpc in proper length ( proper length is used given the absence of a hubble flow on these small scales ) . extrapolating to 5  kpc ( using @xmath26 ) we get a correlation function of 1175 , i.e. an observed surface density 1175 larger than expected for random projection . using the random - projection estimate of 0.0032 @xcite ,",
    "the expected observed number is actually 3.76 , i.e. 3 to 4 such binaries are expected .",
    "the study of hennawi et al . is based on quasars with a mean @xmath27 due to the smaller number of quasars at lower @xmath28 , and it does not extend down to 5  kpc due to the fiber angular resolution limit .",
    "however , the study of hennawi et al . indicates that the probability to find a 5  kpc binary quasar in the sample used by @xcite is of the order of unity .",
    "each of the two quasars in the binary may be contributing its broad - line emission system to the total light , producing the double broad - line system discovered by @xcite .",
    "thus , rather than having a binary black - hole system on a scale of 0.1-pc , we may have a binary quasar system on a 5-kpc scale , most likely residing within two strongly interacting galaxies .",
    "the velocity separation of 3500 km  s@xmath0 @xcite is rather large , but not implausible in a cluster of galaxies . about half the clusters studied by @xcite show such an extent of velocities .",
    "the maximum velocity differences in the quasar binaries studied by @xcite is 1870 km  s@xmath0 , but that study imposed a cap of 2000 km  s@xmath0 on the binary velocity separation . at a projected relative velocity of 3500 km  s@xmath0",
    ", two galaxies can not form a bound system , so the term binary quasar here does not refer to a physically bound binary system .",
    "for some small x - ray and radio selected samples of radio - quiet agns , a link between the radio and x - ray emission has been suggested by the correlation between the radio and the x - ray luminosities @xcite .",
    "while intriguing , such a radio / x - ray connection should be verified by using an unbiased survey .",
    "the pg quasar sample is a complete optically - selected sample @xcite , making it independent of radio and x - ray biases . @xcite",
    "have used these radio - quiet pg quasars to demonstrate that ( a ) the radio and the x - ray luminosities are correlated over a large range of agn luminosity and ( b ) the correlation follows @xmath29 , the well - established correlation for coronally active cool stars @xcite , where @xmath18 at 5 ghz and @xmath30 is in the 0.2 - 20  kev band . for cool stars ,",
    "the @xmath29 relation is accepted as a manifestation of coronal heating by energetic electrons following magnetic reconnection , that subsequently gives rise to x - ray emission . by analogy with cool stars , @xcite conjecture that the radio emission in radio - quiet agns may also be related to coronal magnetic activity .",
    "this coronal framework can be tested for sdss j1536 + 0441 by making use of its recent swift observation by @xcite , carried out in 2009 february 4 and 5 , just two weeks before our vla observations .",
    "@xcite measure a 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath31  erg  s@xmath0 , with a spectral slope of @xmath32 .",
    "this gives @xmath33  erg  s@xmath0 at 1 kev , and thus @xmath30 of @xmath34  erg  s@xmath0 ( see @xcite for the conversion of @xmath35 at 1 kev to @xmath30 ) .",
    "the total radio luminosity we find at 8.5 ghz is @xmath36  erg  s@xmath0 , which extrapolates to @xmath37  erg  s@xmath0 , assuming a spectral slope of @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore get @xmath39 which falls within the range of ratios seen by @xcite for the radio - quiet pg quasars .",
    "thus , sdss j1536 + 0441 follows the radio / x - ray relation of optically selected radio quiet quasars .",
    "the radio - quiet quasar sdss j1536 + 0441 has two broad - line emission systems that @xcite interpret as a candidate binary black - hole system with a separation of 0.1 pc ( 0.02 mas ) .",
    "our new vla imaging at 8.5 ghz reveals two sources , separated by 0.97 ( 5.1 kpc ) , within the quasar s optical localization region .",
    "each radio source has a diameter of less than 0.37 ( 1.9 kpc ) .",
    "other radio - quiet quasars do exhibit double structures , suggesting that the radio double in sdss j1536 + 0441 could be energized by the candidate 0.1-pc binary .",
    "alternatively , the radio emission may arise from a binary system of quasars with a projected separation of 5.1 kpc , and those two quasars may be responsible for the two observed broad - line emission systems .",
    "binary agns with kpc - scale separations are known from radio and x - ray observations , and a few such system are expected in the @xcite sample based on the observed clustering of quasars down to a scale of 10 kpc .",
    "interestingly , the balmer emission line profiles shown by @xcite are noticeably different than those in @xcite . for h@xmath5",
    "the the peak of the r component is about 40% of the peak of b component , as measured above the `` valley '' between the r and b components , while in @xcite it is about 60% .",
    "similarly , for h@xmath4 the r peak is about 75% of the b peak in @xcite , while in @xcite it is about 95% .",
    "these could be due to profile variability , but it could also be due to different contributions of two point sources to the total spectrum , due to different slit positions in the @xcite and @xcite spectra .",
    "if the 5-kpc binary interpretation is correct then ground - based adaptive optics imaging in the visible band , with sub - arcsecond resolution , should clearly show two point sources , and spectroscopy of those sources should exhibit two different spectra , each one with a single broad emission - line system .",
    "deep optical imaging on arcsecond scales may also reveal the nature of the host galaxy , and whether strongly interacting galaxies are involved .    deep optical imaging on arcminute scales can establish whether or not sdss j1536 + 0441 resides in a cluster .",
    "@xcite noted two nearby galaxies with similar photometric redshifts , which may indicate the presence of such a cluster .",
    "however , a cluster is likely in both the 0.1-pc and 5-kpc binary interpretations , as a binary black - hole also requires an earlier merger .",
    "the only difference between the two interpretation is the timescale since the merger occurred , which can be a fraction of the hubble time for a 0.1-pc binary .",
    "on such a timescale the immediate environment may relax , but the larger scale cluster environment evolves independently of the merger process .    follow - up radio observations at other frequencies and epochs , as well as with higher angular resolutions , can help distinguish between the 0.1-pc and 5-kpc binary interpretations . specifically , demonstrating that each radio source has a flat spectrum , is time - variable , and remains compact at higher resolution would strongly support the 5-kpc binary interpretation .",
    "in contrast , in the 0.1-pc binary case , one ( or both ) of the radio sources would be expected to be steady in time , have a steep spectrum , and begin to show an outflow - like structure when examined with higher resolution ; a flat - spectrum source paired with a steep - spectrum source would suggest a core - jet morphology .    if the 5-kpc binary interpretation is correct , then sdss j1536 + 0441 may form the first known compact binary quasar of two luminous broad - line systems , unlike the earlier x - ray - discovered compact systems where one or both of the agns are partly obscured , or broad emission lines are missing altogether .",
    "we thank shai kaspi for his help with the x - ray analysis .",
    "we acknowledge useful feedback from two anonymous referees .",
