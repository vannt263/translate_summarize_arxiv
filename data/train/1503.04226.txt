    "a hadamard matrix of order @xmath4 is an @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 with elements @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the @xmath5 identity matrix and @xmath10 stands for transposition .",
    "if in addition @xmath11 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath12 , then it is called a symmetric hadamard matrix .",
    "a list of currently open cases for symmetric hadamard matrices appears in @xcite , page 277 , table 1.52 , and states that the only @xmath13 odd values of @xmath14 for which a symmetric hadamard matrix of order @xmath15 is not known to exist are : @xmath16 however , symmetric conference matrices of order @xmath17 were constructed by r. mathon @xcite in 1978 , and it is well known that this implies the existence of symmetric hadamard matrices of order @xmath18 . by modifying mathon s construction , balonin and seberry @xcite have constructed two more symmetric conference matrices of order @xmath17 inequivalent to those of mathon .    in this paper",
    "we construct symmetric hadamard matrices of orders @xmath19 .",
    "all of them are constructed by using the gp array of balonin and seberry @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the back - diagonal matrix obtained from the identity matrix by reversing the order of rows . in order to obtain a symmetric hadamard matrix of order @xmath15 from this array",
    "we need four circulant @xmath22-matrices ( also known as _ binary matrices _ ) @xmath23 of order @xmath24 such that    \\(i ) @xmath25 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "such quadruples @xmath28 $ ] can be constructed from suitable difference families , also known as _ supplementary difference sets ( sds ) _ , in the cyclic group @xmath29 consisting of four blocks .",
    "the authors of @xcite refer to these quadruples as _ propus matrices _ and to the corresponding symmetric hadamard matrix as a _ propus - hadamard matrix_.    in the case @xmath30 , our construction is quite different from those in @xcite and @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath31 we use a method for parallel collision search .",
    "we had to adapt this method in order to be able to apply it to the problem of searching for suitable quadruples @xmath28 $ ] . in the case",
    "@xmath32 we in fact construct d - optimal matrices ( see e.g. @xcite ) of order @xmath33 from two binary circulants @xmath34 with @xmath26 .",
    "the blocks @xmath35 and @xmath36 are provided by the paley difference set in @xmath37 .    the smallest order for which the existence question for symmetric hadamard matrices is still undecided is now @xmath38 .",
    "moreover we give a new infinite series of symmetric hadamard matrices derived from the series of hadamard matrices constructed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) .",
    "we summarize some results pertaining to the existence of infinite series of symmetric hadamard matrices .",
    "the summary is far from being exhaustive .",
    "the following result is proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.6.5 ) .",
    "if @xmath39 is a prime power and @xmath40 is a prime power , then there exists a symmetric conference matrix of order @xmath41 and a symmetric hadamard matrix of order @xmath42 .",
    "note that for @xmath43 one obtains a symmetric hadamard matrix of order @xmath2 .",
    "the following result is mentioned in .",
    "if @xmath44 and @xmath45 are both odd prime powers , then there exists a symmetric regular hadamard matrix of order @xmath46 .",
    "a list of @xmath47 classes of orders of symmetric hadamard matrices appears in @xcite , appendix d. some of these classes are infinite . for example",
    "class shiii is an infinite class , as a consequence of dirichlet s theorem on the existence of primes in arithmetic progressions .",
    "another infinite series has been discovered recently in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) :    let @xmath48 be a prime power . then propus matrices exist for orders @xmath49 which give propus - hadamard matrices of order @xmath50 .    this series is derived from turyn s infinite series of williamson matrices @xcite and can be plugged into the gp array .",
    "another construction of symmetric hadamard matrices of the same order has been known for long time , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.2 , p. 339 ) .",
    "one of us ( d.d . ) has subsequently observed that the same construction is applicable to the infinite series of hadamard matrices of goethals  seidel type constructed by xia , xia , seberry , and wu ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3 ) :    let @xmath51 be a prime power @xmath52 . then there exists an hadamard matrix of order @xmath53 of goethals  seidel type in which @xmath54    in fact their matrix is not just a hadamard matrix but also a skew hadamard matrix .    instead of plugging the quadruple",
    "@xmath28 $ ] into the goethals  seidel array , we can plug the permuted quadruple @xmath55 $ ] into the gp array to obtain a propus - hadamard matrix .",
    "thus we have the following theorem :    let @xmath51 be a prime power @xmath52 .",
    "then there exists a symmetric hadamard matrix of order @xmath53 of gp - type , i.e. , obtained by using the gp array .    for @xmath56",
    "these symmetric hadamard matrices are displayed on balonin s webpages http://mathscinet.ru / catalogue / propus / dragomir/.",
    "we want to construct a sds @xmath57 $ ] in @xmath58 with parameters @xmath59 such that the subset @xmath60 is symmetric and @xmath27 .",
    "this is necessary in order to use the gp array .",
    "thus @xmath60 and @xmath61 have cardinality 13 , and @xmath35 cardinality 11 .",
    "( the other option , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 of cardinality 11 and @xmath35 of cardinality 13 , was treated separately in the same manner . )",
    "we generate three files , one for each of @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath60-file contains the symmetric subsets of cardinality 13 , the @xmath61-file arbitrary subsets of cardinality 13 , and the @xmath35-file arbitrary subsets of cardinality 11 .",
    "( each subset is recorded on a separate line . )",
    "we do not collect all such subsets , but only those that pass the power spectral density ( psd ) test .",
    "this test is an important tool as it cuts down the size of the file considerably . for a description of the psd test see @xcite . for each of these three files and subset recorded there ,",
    "we compute and record in a new file the periodic autocorrelation function ( paf ) of the corresponding binary sequence of length 29 .",
    "the subsets @xmath63 will form a sds if and only if the sum of their pafs takes the value @xmath64 at all shifts different from 0 .",
    "thus the search for sdss boils down to selecting one line in each of the @xmath62 paf - files such that the element - wise sum of the first , second and twice the third line is equal to 19 .    to find such a triple of lines , we adapted the meet - in - the - middle parallel collision finding technique of @xcite .",
    "let us represent a line in the paf file of @xmath60 as the sequence @xmath65 , and similarly for the paf files of @xmath61 and @xmath35 . to find a triple of lines such that @xmath66 we define two functions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 : @xmath69    with these definitions , any case where @xmath70 constitutes a solution , and thus the existence of a symmetric hadamard .",
    "to execute the search , we have a large number of processors perform random walks through the space of combinations of lines .",
    "walks start at random positions , and deterministically decide at each step whether to execute @xmath67 or @xmath68 , and which lines of the file to read . to determine which function to perform in the next step , we concatenate the values in the result of @xmath67 or @xmath68 , and run that through a sha-1 hash function .",
    "an indicator for the next function to perform , and corresponding line indices , are then derived from this hash value .",
    "a walk terminates when the resultant hash value reaches some pre - defined condition ( usually a certain number of 0s at the beginning of the hash string , the choice of which depends on the time - memory tradeoff between computation and storage time ) .",
    "starting and ending points of all completed walks are stored in a set shared by all processors .",
    "this means that , with high probability , if two concatenated sums from both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the same , then the hash value will be the same , and the two walks will ` merge ' and arrive at the same point in the collective set of stored walks .",
    "when such an instance occurs , we have found our solution .",
    "we implemented this algorithm in c++11 , using boost.mpi .",
    "the specific implementation was adapted from @xcite .",
    "all the data from the files was stored in a sqlite database .",
    "as the initial files are rather large , we perform a preprocessing step before doing the matching .",
    "all three initial paf files are divided into subfiles based on the first number in each line .",
    "then , only combinations of three subfiles such that the first numbers of each line sum to @xmath71 are actually run through the program .    as the algorithm is random and parallel , it is difficult to benchmark its runtime .",
    "we ran it on sharcnet s orca cluster , a machine whose nodes have processors with speeds of either 2.2ghz or 2.7ghz , and a minimum of 32 gb ram .",
    "we used 16 mpi processes : 14 of them continuously executed random walks , one held the shared set of completed walks , and the last was responsible for receiving pairs of walks which ended at the same point , and extracting possible solutions .",
    "searches were done for a fixed amount of time , usually 24h .",
    "of the 15 matches found for @xmath72 , the shortest time taken was 238 seconds ; the longest took over nine hours .",
    "all but five of the matches were found in less than three hours .",
    "in this section we present the construction of symmetric hadamard matrices of orders @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the order @xmath2 is not new .",
    "the orders @xmath76 are new .",
    "the solutions are listed in the form of sdss with four base blocks . from them",
    "one can construct the corresponding binary sequences and also the circulant matrices . to be specific , we label the positions of a binary sequence of length @xmath24 with @xmath77 in that order . to a given subset",
    "@xmath78 we associate the binary sequence whose @xmath79 entries occur exactly at the positions labeled by the elements of @xmath80 . further , to such a binary sequence we associate the circulant matrix of order @xmath24 whose first row is that sequence .",
    "these circulant matrices can be plugged in to the gp array , in a suitable order , to obtain the symmetric hadamard matrix .",
    "we say that a block of a sds is _ symmetric _ if the corresponding binary circulant matrix is symmetric .",
    "all four sdss have parameters @xmath81 and are written as @xmath82 $ ] with @xmath60 symmetric .",
