    "kramers  wannier ( kw ) duality in 2d statistical models can be formulated as a simple topological claim about pictures like this one :    @xmath0 the picture represents a 3d body ( a ritual mask ) made of yellow material , with the surface partially painted in red and black .",
    "for definiteness imagine that the invisible side is unpainted ( i.e. completely yellow ) .",
    "in general we have a compact oriented yellow 3-fold @xmath1 with the boundary coloured in this way ( in a locally nice way : the borders of the colour stains are piecewise linear ( say ) and at most three of them meet at a single point ) .",
    "we choose a finite abelian group @xmath2 and its dual @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the yellow part of the boundary ; it is an oriented surface with the boundary coloured in black and red .",
    "the relative cohomology groups @xmath5 and @xmath6 are mutually dual via poincar duality ( in expressions like @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes the red part of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the black part ) .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the restriction maps . according to kw duality , their images are each other s annihilators .",
    "it is an immediate consequence of poincar duality and of the exactness of @xmath13    in statistical models it is used in the following form : we take a function @xmath14 on @xmath5 ( the boltzmann weight ) and compute the partition sum z(f)=_xh^1(,r;g)f((x)).let @xmath15 denote the fourier transform of @xmath14 .",
    "we can compute z(f)=_xh^1(,b ; g)f((x)).kw duality says ( via poisson summation formula ) that up to an inessential factor we have @xmath16 .",
    "let us stop to make a connection with more usual formulations .",
    "notice that an element of @xmath17 is the same as ( the isomorphism class of ) a principal @xmath2-bundle over @xmath9 with a given section over @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a 3d ball ( with coloured surface ) , an element of @xmath19 is therefore specified by choosing an element of @xmath2 for each red stain .",
    "we may imagine that there is a @xmath2-valued spin sitting at each such stain and , to compute ( 1 ) , we take the sum over all their values ( we overcount @xmath20 times , but it is inessential ) . according to kw duality , the same result can be obtained by summing over @xmath21-spins at the black stains .",
    "the spins at red ( or black ) stains interact through the yellow stains .",
    "if all the yellow stains are as those visible on the picture ( disks with two red and two black neighbours ) , we have the usual two - point interactions ; for disks with more neighbours we would have more - point interactions .",
    "finally , let us look at the picture again .",
    "it does not represent a ball and the back yellow stain is not a disk .",
    "the boltzmann weight for the back stain can be understood as the specification of the boundary and periodicity conditions on the visible surface ( the @xmath2-bundle type together with sections over the red parts of the boundary ) ; again there are spins at the red stains but the neighbours of the back yellow stain are not summed over ",
    "they form the boundary condition .",
    "these examples are more or less all that we would like ; the general case seems to be general beyond usual applications .",
    "but it will come handy when we consider non - abelian generalizations .",
    "the kw duality described up to now is only the @xmath22-version .",
    "for the @xmath23-version ( for statistical models in @xmath24 dimensions ) we consider yellow @xmath25-dimensional @xmath1 s with @xmath26 in the three colours as before ( up to now only the combination @xmath24 enters ) . instead of @xmath19 and @xmath27",
    "we take @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the claim and the proof of @xmath23-duality are as in the @xmath22-case .",
    "what are we going to do ?",
    "first of all , expression ( 1 ) has the form of a very simple topological field theory ( with boundary coloured in red and black ) , described in the next section .",
    "we shall then look at the non - abelian version . in the @xmath22-case classical models",
    "suggest that the pair @xmath2 , @xmath3 should be replaced by a pair of mutually dual quantum groups .",
    "so we are faced with the difficult and somewhat arbitrary task of defining and understanding quantum analogues of cohomology groups and of the poisson summation formula .",
    "but miraculously , none of these has to be done .",
    "pictures alone ( in the form of tfts ) solve the problem and quantum groups appear .",
    "this suggests , of course , that this point of view might be interesting in higher dimensions , the @xmath30 case  the electric  magnetic duality  being of particular interest .",
    "as we mentioned , expression ( 1 ) ( and its generalization to @xmath23 ) has the form of a tft with boundary coloured in red and black .",
    "we understand tft as defined by atiyah @xcite and for definiteness we choose its hermitian version ; nothing like central extensions is taken into account . to each oriented yellow @xmath31-dim @xmath32 with black - and - red boundary , we associate a non - zero finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath33 . and for each @xmath1 we have a linear form on the hilbert space corresponding to @xmath4  the one given by ( 1 ) . however , the normalization has to be changed slightly for the gluing property to hold ( this is only a technical problem ) : we set z_(f)=1()_xh^k(,r;g)f((x))and for the inner product f , g=()_xh^k(,r;g)g(x).here ( ) = |h^k-1(,r;g)||h^k-3(,r;g)|  |h^k-2(,r;g)||h^k-4(,r;g)|  (and the the same for @xmath32 ) .",
    "perhaps this @xmath34 is not a number you would like to meet in a dark forest , but this should not hide the simplicity of the thing .",
    "the gluing property follows from the exact sequence for the triple @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is the red part of @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is achieved by separating slightly the glued yellow surfaces ) .",
    "of course , the expression for @xmath34 was actually derived from this sequence .",
    "this tft reformulation of kw duality will be our starting point for non - abelian generalizations .",
    "let us first have a look to see if we can recover the numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the group @xmath2 from the tft .",
    "it is enough to take yellow @xmath31-dim balls as @xmath32 s .",
    "the ball should be painted as follows : let us choose integers @xmath41 such that @xmath42 ; we take a @xmath43 and paint its tubular neighbourhood in @xmath44 in red ; the rest ( a tubular neighbourhood of a @xmath45 ) is in black .",
    "let us denote this @xmath32 as @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding hilbert space is trivial ( equal to @xmath47 ) if @xmath48 ; if @xmath49 , it is the space of functions on @xmath2 .",
    "the reader may try to define the hopf algebra structure on this space using pictures ( the @xmath22-case is drawn in the next section ) .",
    "our tfts are of a rather special nature , because of the excision property of relative cohomology .",
    "it gives rise to the _ squeezing property _ of our tfts .",
    "it is best explained by using an example .",
    "imagine this full cylinder ( the upper half of its mantle is red and the lower half is black ; the invisible base is yellow ) :    @xmath50 we shall squeeze it in the middle , putting one finger on the red top and the other on the black bottom .",
    "the result is no longer a manifold  it has a rectangle in the middle ( red from the top and black from the bottom ) , but it is surely homotopically equivalent ( as a pair @xmath51 , or as a pair @xmath52 ) to the original cylinder . since we use relative cohomologies , the rectangle may be removed ( it does not matter whether the cohomologies are relative to @xmath8 or to @xmath10 ( the dual picture ) , as the rectangle is both red and black ) .",
    "the result is again a manifold of the type we admit :    @xmath53    or , as another example : if our fingers are not big enough , we do not separate the cylinder into two parts , but instead we produce a hole in the middle ( the top view of the result would be a red stain with a hole in the middle ) .    a bit",
    "informally the squeezing property can be formulated as follows : if a ( hyper)surface appears as a result of squeezing @xmath1 , red from one side and black from the other side , it may be removed .",
    "those tfts that satisfy the squeezing property may be considered as generalizations of relative cohomology and of kw duality . as we shall see in the next setion , in the @xmath22-case they yield the expected result .",
    "here is an example of such a tft that does not come from an abelian group .",
    "we take a finite group @xmath2 and two subgroups @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we shall consider principal @xmath2-bundles with reduction to @xmath57 over @xmath8 and to @xmath58 over @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath59 is such a thing , let @xmath60 be the number of automorphisms of @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath61 is a space with some red and some black parts , let @xmath62 be the set of isomorphism classes of these things .",
    "we set @xmath63 ( the hilbert space ) to be the space of functions on @xmath64 with the inner product f , g=_pp()(p)g(p ) and finally , if @xmath65 , we set z_(f)=_pp()1(p)f(p|_y).this is surely a tft .",
    "the squeezing property holds , because if we have a reduction for both @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( as we have on the surfaces that appear by squeezing ) , these two reductions intersect in a section of the @xmath2-bundle .",
    "if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , this tft describes interacting @xmath2-spins ( as in the introduction ) ; the general case is more interesting , and we will meet its version in  4 .",
    "there are classical models ( those appearing in poisson  lie t - duality @xcite ) that suggest a non - abelian generalization of @xmath22 kw duality .",
    "the pl t - duality generalizes the usual @xmath68 t - duality , replacing the two circles ( or tori ) by a pair of mutually dual pl groups .",
    "clearly , we have to replace the pair @xmath2 , @xmath3 by a pair of mutually dual quantum groups .",
    "this is not an easy ( or well - defined ) task .",
    "we have to define and to _ understand _ cohomologies with quantum coefficients .    here",
    "is how pictures solve this problem in a very simple way : just take a tft in three dimensions , satisfying the squeezing property .",
    "a finite quantum group ( finite - dimensional hopf @xmath69-algebra ) will appear independently of the classical motivation .",
    "if you exchange red and black ( which gives a new tft ) , the quantum group will be replaced by its dual .",
    "this is the non - abelian ( or quantum ) @xmath22 kw duality .",
    "now we will draw the pictures .",
    "i learned this 3d way of representing quantum groups at a lecture by kontsevich @xcite ; it was one of the sources of this work .",
    "the finite quantum group itself is @xmath70 .",
    "the product @xmath71 is on this picture :    @xmath72    and here are all the operations .",
    "coloured 3d objects are hard to draw ( but not hard to visualize ! ) ; imagine that the pictures represent balls and that their invisible sides are completely yellow .",
    "the antipode @xmath73 is simply the half - turn , the involution @xmath74 is the reflection with respect to the horizontal diameter , and the rest is on the figure :    @xmath75    why is it a quantum group ?",
    "just imagine the pictures representing the axioms and use the squeezing property in a very simple manner .",
    "let us make a conjecture that there is a 11 correspondence between finite quantum groups and 3d tfts satisfying the squeezing property , with trivial ( i.e. one - dimensional ) @xmath76 and @xmath77 . to support the conjecture , finite quantum groups are in 11 correspondence with modular functors of a certain kind ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , clearly connected with our tfts .",
    "let us recall a basic analogy between symplectic manifolds and vector spaces ( the aim of quantization is to go beyond a mere analogy ) :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can easily describe the symplectic analogue of the chern  simons tft ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath78 be a lie algebra with invariant inner product .",
    "if @xmath32 is a closed oriented surface then the moduli space of flat @xmath78-connections is a symplectic manifold ( with singularities ) .",
    "the symplectic form is given as follows .",
    "the vector space of all @xmath78-valued 1-forms on @xmath32 is symplectic , with the symplectic form ( _ 1,_2)=__1,_2.when we restrict ourselves to flat connections , the space is no longer symplectic , but the null directions of the 2-form give just the orbits of the gauge group , so the quotient ( the moduli space ) is symplectic .",
    "let us denote it by @xmath79 .",
    "we have associated a symplectic space to every oriented closed surface .",
    "now , if @xmath1 is an oriented compact 3-fold with boundary @xmath32 , we should find a lagrangian subspace @xmath80 . indeed , @xmath81 consists just of those flat connections on @xmath32 , which can be extended to @xmath1 .",
    "let us make a minute extension of this construction , allowing a boundary coloured in red and black .",
    "let @xmath82 be a manin triple .",
    "we shall consider flat @xmath78 connections as before , with the obvious boundary conditions  on the red part of the boundary the connection should take values in @xmath83 and on the black part in @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , the gauge group consists of the maps to @xmath2 with the same boundary conditions .",
    "this really defines a symplectic tft for our pictures . from this symplectic tft",
    "we obtain a symplectic analogue of quantum group ( using the pictures of the previous section ) .",
    "one readily checks that it is the double symplectic groupoid of lu and weinstein @xcite  the symplectic analogue of the quantum group coming from the manin triple @xmath82 .    for this reason",
    ", it is reasonable to conjecture that perturbative quantization of our chern ",
    "simons tft with boundary will give the corresponding quantum group .",
    "in the next section we return to the vector side of our table , to general 3d tfts that satisfy the squeezing property .",
    "we shall see this connection with cs tfts again , in a different guise .",
    "there are lots of algebras , modules , etc . , in our pictures .",
    "we shall describe only the drinfeld double , since it is important in pl t - duality , and also to make a connection with reshetikhin  turaev invariants . here",
    "are the unit and the counit :    @xmath85 the invisible side of the full torus on the first picture is yellow ; this closed yellow strip is the double . on the second picture",
    "it is represented as the mantle of the cylinder ( the invisible base of the cylinder is painted as the visible one ) .    here is the product ( the picture is yellow from the invisible side ) : @xmath86 and finally the coproduct : @xmath87 this picture requires an explanation .",
    "it represents a thick y from which a thin y was removed ( you can see it as the black holes in the yellow disks ) .",
    "the fronts of these y s are red and their backs are black ( the invisible bottom of the picture is yellow  it is the third double ) .    for completeness , the antipode is a half - turn and the involution a reflection , both exchanging the boundary circles of the double .",
    "= wncyr10 now we know the double as a hopf algebra , but its real treasure is the @xmath57-matrix : @xmath88 it is quite similar to the y - picture , but this time we do not remove a thin x , but rather two tubes connecting the top holes with the bottom ones",
    ". however , if one tube connected the left holes and the other one the right holes , the picture would not be very interesting .",
    "we could squeeze the x in the middle , dividing it into two vertical cylinders .",
    "we would simply have an identity .",
    "however , in the x of the @xmath57-matrix , the tubes are diagonal .",
    "there are two ways for them to avoid each other ; one gives the @xmath57-matrix and the other its inverse .",
    "this x has two incoming and two outgoing doubles ; you can also imagine @xmath89 doubles at the bottom , tubes forming a braid inside and leaving the body at the top , in the middle of @xmath89 other doubles ( the cyrillic letter zh is good here ) .",
    "we directly see a representation of the braid group .    with this picture in mind , we can find the reshetikhin ",
    "turaev ( rt ) invariants coming from the double .",
    "namely , the boundary - free part of our tft is the chern  simons theory coming from the double .",
    "here is a sketch of the proof : suppose @xmath1 is a closed oriented 3-fold with a ribbon link .",
    "we colour each of the ribbons in red on one side and in black on the other side , blow it a little , so that the ribbon becomes a full torus removed from @xmath1 , and paint on the torus a little yellow belt .",
    "our tft gives us an element of @xmath90 ( one double for each yellow belt ) , where @xmath89 is the number of components of the link .",
    "actually , this element is from @xmath91 ( we can move a yellow belt along the torus and come back from the other side ) .",
    "it is equal to the rt invariant .",
    "this claim follows immediately from the definition of rt invariants : if @xmath92 , we are back in our picture of braid group , and generally , surgery along tori in @xmath93 can be replaced by gluing tori along the yellow belts .",
    "finally , we can get rid of red and black and instead consider @xmath1 s with boundary consisting of yellow tori : one easily sees that @xmath94 .",
    "there are several open problems remaining .",
    "apart from the mentioned conjectures there is a problem with the square of the antipode : for the naive definition of tft used in this paper , it has to be 1 .",
    "one should find a less naive definition and prove in some form the claim that our pictures are equivalent to hopf algebras .",
    "however , in spite of these open problems , the presented picture is very simple and quite appealing .",
    "it is really tempting ( and almost surely incorrect ) to suggest it would be nice to understand the basic building blocks of these tfts that replace quantum groups in higher dimensions .",
    "it is a purely topological problem",
    ". it would also be nice to have a non - trivial example with non - trivial @xmath95 , to see an instance of s - duality ( @xmath30-duality ) in this way",
