    "pattern formation is an intrinsically dissipative process@xcite , however the laws of physics are microscopically reversible : there is no dissipation at the microscopic scale . in this paper",
    "we describe a simple system which organizes into patterns through microscopically reversible dynamics , hence it also models how dissipation arises ( i.e. , how information flows between the macroscopic and the microscopic degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this system provides a clear example of how to reconcile the macroscopic irreversibility that gives rise to patterns with the microscopic reversibility adhered to by physical processes .",
    "motivated by the desire to understand this general issue , we study specific details of the model , focusing on transitions in the resulting growth morphology and the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we have previously observed several examples of reversible cellular automata dynamics which produce large scale order through microscopically reversible dynamics@xcite .",
    "in contrast other research in the field of pattern formation has focused on irreversible microscopic mechanisms , with examples ranging from crystal growth@xcite , to turing patterns in chemical reactions@xcite , to patterns formed by growing bacterial colonies@xcite , to kinetic growth problems@xcite .",
    "here we model cluster growth by reversible aggregation ( ra ) , generalizing the irreversible diffusion limited aggregation model ( dla)@xcite to include contact with a heat bath .",
    "particles , which are initially diffusing on a two - dimensional lattice , stick upon first contacting a cluster member and release heat which then diffuses about a superimposed lattice representing the heat bath .",
    "the two subsystems exchange only heat and together form a closed system .",
    "the release of heat transfers entropy from the aggregating system ( which is becoming ordered ) into the heat bath ( which was initially empty ) .",
    "when the heat bath is nearly empty the model is essentially equivalent to the canonical dla formulation ( analogous to a supercooled gas crystalizing in a far from equilibrium situation ) .",
    "hence the ra growth cluster initially resembles a typical dla cluster .",
    "as the heat bath becomes populated , singly connected cluster members are able to absorb heat and evaporate . as the effect of evaporation becomes significant",
    "the ra and dla models diverge .",
    "the ra dynamics is exactly invertible : at any point we can invert the dynamics and run backwards , observing the flow of heat from the heat bath back into the gas - crystal system until we recover the exact initial condition .",
    "the population levels of the heat bath and of the aggregate initially grow linearly in time , quickly reaching stable values which remain very nearly constant for the remainder of the evolution .",
    "the energy of each subsystem is a function only of the population levels , independent of the physical configuration of the particles .",
    "hence , once the population levels stabilize , the rate of energy exchange ( which is entirely in the form of heat ) between the heat bath and the gas - aggregate system becomes so slow that we can characterize the subsequent dynamics as a quasistatic process , with a well defined temperature at all times .",
    "the aggregate mostly forms while the heat bath is at a lower temperature than in the quasistatic steady - state . hence ,",
    "after the population levels stabilize , the cluster slowly anneals .",
    "the cluster morphology , which initially resembles a dla cluster , gradually becomes more spread out and tortuous , until it ultimately resembles a branched polymer with quenched randomness .",
    "the two timescales that characterize the growth process are separated by two orders of magnitude .",
    "initially , the population levels quickly reach a quasistatic steady - state .",
    "subsequently , the aggregate slowly anneals until reaching the ensemble of configurations corresponding to the highest entropy macrostate ( the branched polymer ) .    aside from insight into microscopically reversible mechanisms that give rise to macroscopic patterns ,",
    "the development of invertible dynamics and algorithms has technological significance in pushing down the barrier to atomic scale computing . each bit of information erased at temperature @xmath1 releases at least @xmath2 units of heat into the environment@xcite .",
    "heat is created in proportion to the volume of the computer , yet heat leaves the computer only in proportion to the surface area .",
    "hence , as logic gate density in computers increases , the use of an invertible dynamics ( which does not erase information and hence does not need to produce heat ) will be required to keep the mechanical parts from burning up@xcite . from a more pedagogical viewpoint ,",
    "discrete computer models of reversible microscopic dynamics provide a laboratory for studying non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and the approach to equilibrium .",
    "these models let us explore physically plausible dynamics for non - equilibrium systems ( i.e. , discrete dynamics which are microscopically reversible and thus automatically obey liouville s theorem ) .",
    "a particularly instructive example of this approach is the formulation of a dynamical ising model@xcite .",

    "@xcite for a review of real - space renormalization group approaches to dla .",
    "the typical scenario for dla begins with a vacant two - dimensional lattice initialized with a single stationary seed particle , which is the nucleation site for a growth cluster .",
    "moving particles are introduced from the edges of the lattice , following random walks along the lattice sites . when a moving particle lands on a site adjacent to a stationary seed particle ( an active site ) it sticks ( i.e. , the moving particle aggregates and becomes a stationary seed particle ) .",
    "the frozen aggregate particles constitute the solid ( crystal ) phase , and the moving particles constitute the gas phase .",
    "aggregation hence consists of a particle undergoing an irreversible transition from gas to solid .",
    "gas particles are usually introduced in a serial manner : only one gas particle is diffusing at a time .",
    "however , to take advantage of parallel computational resources , parallel models of dla have been studied in which multiple particles are diffusing at once@xcite . in the dilute particle limit",
    "these models recover the serial dla model exactly .    with the first aggregation event the dla cluster grows from one single to two adjacent sites .",
    "the presence of the second cluster member eliminates certain paths along which random walkers could approach the first , with the effect that the probability of sticking at either end ( tip ) of the cluster is enhanced , whereas the probability of sticking along the edge of the cluster is reduced . as particles continue to aggregate creating new cluster tips and edges , the probability to stick at the tips continually outweighs the probability to stick along the edges .",
    "this leads to branching .",
    "a second influence on the growth morphology comes from shadowing : the probability for a particle to diffuse into the center of the growth cluster before encountering an active site becomes negligible as the cluster grows in size .",
    "hence the outer tips grow most rapidly . as a result",
    "the growth aggregate rapidly assumes a bushy and branching , random fractal structure , resembling frost on a window pane , the branching of neurons , and many other branched structures found in nature .",
    "our goal is to introduce a reversible , deterministic model of growth by aggregation , where reversible means that from any state of our system we can recover the previous state exactly .",
    "we must address the subtleties of making each component step invertible , including steps which realize stochastic processes . as we discuss below , the same mechanisms that are employed in our model in order to ensure exact conservation of energy , particle number , and other constraints , also make it easy to incorporate invertibility .",
    "the stochastic component of the model is diffusion , which is modeled as a sequence of invertible `` random walks '' based on a deterministic algorithm using an invertible pseudorandom number generator .",
    "information about exactly when and where a particle undergoes a phase transition is stored in the heat particles .",
    "the idea of storing information in a heat bath was introduced by creutz@xcite to explore the connection between the microcanonical and canonical ensembles for the dynamical ising model .",
    "heat bath techniques have been used on occasion since then to construct reversible computer models of physical phenomena@xcite .",
    "to construct the reversible aggregation ( ra ) model we begin with a parallel dla system ( similar to that described above ) and add degrees of freedom at each site , corresponding to a distributed heat bath . the latent heat released during each aggregation event can then be explicitly represented . in the ra dynamics ,",
    "whenever a random walking gas particle lands on a site with exactly one nearest neighbor crystal particle , it will stick only if there is room locally in the heat bath to accept the latent heat it will release as the particle transitions from the gas phase to the crystal phase .",
    "the heat is released in quantized units called heat particles , with one heat particle released for each aggregation event .",
    "these heat particles diffuse amongst themselves ( i.e. , they undergo random walks along the lattice sites , independently of the gas particles ) . explicitly modeling the latent heat released upon aggregating",
    "provides a mechanism for modeling the inverse process : a diffusing heat particle which contacts a susceptible crystal particle ( a crystal particle which has only one nearest neighbor crystal particle ) is absorbed while the crystal particle evaporates to become a gas particle which then diffuses away .",
    "the restriction on the dynamics that aggregation and evaporation events can occur only when exactly one nearest neighbor is a crystal particle means that only one crystal bond is ever formed or broken when a single lattice site is updated . as",
    "each aggregate particle contributes one crystal bond to the aggregate , and there is no further potential energy contribution , the energy of the aggregate is a function only of the number of aggregate particles , independent of their configuration .",
    "moreover this constraint has two direct implications for the growth morphology .",
    "the first is that evaporation can only occur for particles which are singly connected to the growth cluster , and so the aggregate can not break off into disconnected clusters . the second is that it introduces an excluded volume ( i.e. , no closed loops can be formed ) , thus we might expect the equilibrium cluster configuration to be similar to that of a polymer .",
    "note that introduction of an evaporation mechanism in the ra model mitigates the shadowing effect that was important in determining the dla growth morphology : crystal particles within the cluster can evaporate , thus introducing gas particles into the interior of the aggregate .",
    "the ra model is constructed with 7-bits of state at each lattice site .",
    "one bit , @xmath3 , denotes the presence or absence of a crystal particle at that site ( i.e. , @xmath4 indicates presence , @xmath5 absence ) .",
    "two bits , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , denote the presence or absence of each of two gas particles .",
    "two bits , @xmath8 , denote the presence or absence of each of two heat particles .",
    "the final 2 bits , @xmath9 , are independent binary pseudorandom variables .",
    "the dynamics of the model consists of two kinds of steps : diffusion steps alternating with interaction steps .    the same kind of diffusion process is applied to the gas and heat subsystems simultaneously and independently , while the crystal particles remain unchanged .",
    "a given diffusion step consists of two parts : mixing and transport . during the mixing portion of the step ,",
    "a binary random variable is used to determine whether or not the two particle bits of that species at the site @xmath10 are interchanged : @xmath11 where @xmath12 or @xmath13 . during the transport portion of the step ,",
    "every site replaces its first particle bit ( @xmath14 ) with the first particle of its neighbor a distance @xmath15 away on one side , and its second particle ( @xmath16 ) with the one from the same distance neighbor on the opposite side . at even time steps ,",
    "we use horizontal neighbors ( i.e. , the diffusion moves particles horizontally ) : @xmath17 at odd time steps we use vertical neighbors ( i.e. , substitute @xmath18 for @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.trans-horz ] ) ) .",
    "the only differences between the gas and heat diffusion are ( 1 ) each uses a separate binary random variable to control its mixing , and ( 2 ) the distance of the neighbor particle to be copied , @xmath15 , can be chosen separately for each subsystem  this allows us to independently control the diffusion constants for the heat bath and for the gas ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "diffusion steps alternate with steps in which the two subsystems  gas - crystal and heat bath  interact allowing aggregation and evaporation .",
    "the rule at a single lattice site during an interaction step is that exactly one particle can aggregate or evaporate provided that    ( a ) : :    there is exactly one crystal particle at one of the four nearest    neighbor sites ( b ) : :    there is room at the site for a crystal particle ( for aggregation ) or    for another gas particle ( for evaporation ) , and ( c ) : :    the heat bits at the site can absorb ( for aggregation ) or supply ( for    evaporation ) one unit of heat .",
    "since the gas and heat particles will undergo a mixing step before transport , it makes no difference which of the two available gas particle positions a crystal particle is moved into when it evaporates , or which of the two possible heat particle positions a unit of heat gets put into . defining this",
    "precisely will , however , become important when we discuss invertibility .",
    "the interaction rule described thus far would be sufficient if we updated just one lattice site at a time .",
    "if , however , all sites on the lattice are updated simultaneously , then the global dynamics no longer obeys the `` single bond '' constraint  that at any site where particles aggregate or evaporate exactly one crystal bond is formed or broken .",
    "for example , suppose that the tip of a crystal branch evaporates just as a gas particle condenses next to it .",
    "each of these events would separately preserve the constraint , but the two simultaneous events result in the addition of a disconnected crystal particle which has no other crystal particle immediately adjacent to it .",
    "we can easily avoid this difficulty by holding the values at the adjacent sites fixed during a step in which we let the subsystems interact at a given lattice site , since the interaction step has a nearest neighbor range .",
    "in other words , we perform a _ checkerboard updating _ : all of the lattice sites in which the @xmath20 and @xmath21 lattice coordinates add up to an even number are updated using our single site interaction rule , while the odd sites are held fixed , and then vice versa .",
    "since nearest neighbors are held fixed during an interaction , the constraint is obeyed locally and thus it is also obeyed globally .",
    "the overall dynamical rule is summarized in table  [ tab.rule]the various phases of the rule are applied consecutively .    every phase of the rule described in table  [ tab.rule ] can be inverted .",
    "the transport portion of the step can be run backwards by simply moving all particles back into the sites they came from ( i.e. , inverting the directions of the transport in eq .",
    "[ eq.trans-horz ] ) .",
    "the mixing portion of the step is easy to invert , given the same `` random '' binary variables that were used to determine which pairs of bits were originally swapped .",
    "we simply swap exactly those pairs again .",
    "the pseudorandom portion of the system ( which supplies the random data ) can simply follow some invertible dynamics that is independent of the rest of the system  the rest of the system looks at the state of this subsystem but does not affect it ",
    "so this pseudorandom subsystem can be run _",
    "backwards _ independently of everything else .    making the interaction steps invertible is also straightforward .",
    "when a single gas particle turns into a crystal particle , we put the heat token that is released into the corresponding heat bit ( i.e. , the heat particle with the same value of @xmath22 ) , and thus we remember which of the two gas particle bits was initially occupied . if the corresponding heat bit is already occupied , the particle is not allowed to aggregate ( even if the other heat bit is unoccupied ) .",
    "similarly , a crystal particle is allowed to evaporate only if it can move into the gas bit with the same value of @xmath22 as the heat token being absorbed .",
    "if there are two gas particles at a site we impose the constraint that the particle with @xmath14 attempts to aggregate first ; likewise if there are two heat particles at a site , the crystal particle attempts to absorb the @xmath14 particle first .",
    "this does not introduce a bias to the growth since we are mixing the @xmath14 and @xmath23 variables in an unbiased manner at each time step . with these refinements , our interaction rule _ applied to a single site _",
    "is its own inverse : if we apply it twice ( without a diffusion step in between ) we get back the state we started with .",
    "since the interaction rule is applied in a checkerboard fashion , sites are updated independently : if we apply the rule a second time to the same checkerboard , it will undo the first application at every site .",
    "thus an inverse step consists of applying the inverses of the rule - phases in the opposite of the order listed  once one phase is undone , the previous phase can be undone .",
    "each inverse step undoes one step of the forward time evolution .",
    "as we watch the inverse evolution , we see each heat particle retrace its path , to be in exactly the right location at the right time to uncrystalize the crystal particle which originally released it .",
    "particles un - aggregate and un - diffuse and un - evaporate in a manner that exactly retraces their behavior in the forward evolution .",
    "the ra model was implemented on a special purpose cellular automata machine , the cam-8@xcite , which was designed to efficiently perform large - scale uniform , spatially arrayed computations . on this machine",
    ", all simulations must be embedded into a lattice gas framework@xcite , in which uniform data movement ( data - advection ) alternates with processing each site independently ( site - update ) . for a 2-dimensional model such as ours , sheets of bits",
    "move coherently during the advection phase : corresponding bits at each site all move in the same direction by the same amount .",
    "the boundaries are periodic  bits that shift past the edge of the lattice reappear at the opposite edge . after moving the bits ,",
    "we perform the site update phase . during this phase ,",
    "the bits that have landed at each lattice site are updated in a single operation by table lookup : the bits at each lattice site are used as an index into a table that contains a complete listing of which state should replace each possible original state . both the data movement and the lookup table",
    "can be freely changed between one lattice updating step and the next .",
    "our model requires 7 bits of state to appear at each site in our @xmath24 lattice . using random data generated by a serial computer ,",
    "the bits which correspond to the gas particles are initially randomly filled with a @xmath25 density of particles and the bits which correspond to the binary random variables with a @xmath26 density of particles .",
    "one crystal particle is placed at the center site of the lattice .",
    "the heat bath is initially empty .",
    "the dynamics on the pseudorandom subsystem is very simple : each of the two random bit - planes ( each consisting of all the @xmath27 s or all of the @xmath28 s ) are simply shifted by some large amount at each time step .",
    "we could choose the amount and direction of each shift at random for each step of updating , using a reversible random number generator running on the workstation controlling the simulation .",
    "instead , the simulations discussed here simply shift the bit planes by a large and fixed amount at each step , making sure that the the @xmath20 and @xmath21 components of the two shifts are all mutually co - prime , as well as being co - prime with the overall dimensions of the lattice .",
    "thus to run the random subsystem backwards , we just reverse the direction of the shifts .",
    "the checkerboard updating is accommodated by adding an eighth bit to each lattice site , and filling these bits with a checkerboard pattern of ones and zeros . in our rule",
    "the various subsystems are allowed to interact only at sites marked with a one .",
    "to change which checkerboard is marked for updating , we simply shift the checkerboard - marker bit - plane by one position in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "the rule described in table  [ tab.rule ] turns into two lattice - gas steps on cam-8 .",
    "the first three phases listed in table  [ tab.rule ] are done during one step , and the next three in the second step .",
    "the data movement is part of each step : note that each of the two steps uses the same lookup table applied to each lattice site , but slightly different data movement . to run backwards , we use the inverse lookup table , and the inverse data movement . note that in the discussion of experimental results , everything in table  [ tab.rule ] is counted as a single step .",
    "cam-8 s event counting hardware was used to monitor simulation parameters while the simulations ran . including event counting , the 8-processor cam-8 performed about @xmath30 site update operations per second for this model .",
    "the dynamics of the ra model , described in detail above , can be succinctly presented in an analytic framework .",
    "we develop this framework first in terms of the discrete space , time , and occupation number variables .",
    "we then ensemble average over the occupation numbers and take the continuum limit of the space and time variables to establish the reaction - diffusion equations for the system .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec.7bits ] there are seven bits of state : @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",

    "there are no external sources or sinks for any of the three species represented ( the gas , crystal , and heat species ) .",
    "energy is only exchanged between the gas - crystal and the heat bath subsystems .",
