    "variational methods are widely used in many areas of physics but are not very prominent in field theory @xcite .",
    "this is due to the infinite number of degrees of freedom and the singular short - distance behaviour of relativistic field theories .",
    "a very successful application of variational methods in a _ non - relativistic _ field theory is provided by feynman s treatment of the polaron @xcite : after integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom and approximating variationally the remaining effective action by a retarded quadratic trial action one obtains the best approximation scheme which works for both small and large coupling constants .",
    "detailed numerical investigations @xcite have shown that feynman s approximate solution deviates at most @xmath4 from the true ground state energy for all coupling constants .",
    "it is therefore very attractive to apply similar techniques to problems in relativistic quantum field theory where there is much need for non - perturbative methods . in previous publications",
    "we have done that in the context of a scalar , super - renormalizable model theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the first results obtained by applying polaron variational methods to a realistic theory , namely quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the quenched approximation where electron - positron loops are neglected . while the actual coupling constant between electrons and photons @xmath5 is small enough to apply perturbation theory in most cases , there is enough interest to study the theory at larger coupling : first , the strong coupling behaviour of any physical theory is of interest in itself , second , the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite demands an investigation at large @xmath6 and , finally , bound state problems are inherently non - perturbative and involve powers of @xmath7 in radiative corrections .    the extension of our methods to qed requires a formalism to include fermions and a treatment of the more severe singularities encountered in a renormalizable field theory rather than a super - renormalizable or non - relativistic one .",
    "we do this within the worldline technique which has recently experienced a revival@xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the degrees of freedom describing the electron are its bosonic worldline @xmath8 , which is the four - dimensional analogue to the polaron trajectory , as well as a grassmannian path @xmath9 needed to describe the electron s spin @xcite . here",

    "to summarize , on the one hand the trial action can not be restricted to contain only supersymmetric terms but on the other hand allowing non - supersymmetric terms may destroy the renormalizability of the theory .    the way out of this predicament is provided by the variational principle itself : although it is unavoidable that the trial action breaks supersymmetry , the actual solutions to the variational equations may in fact be nearly supersymmetric . that this indeed turns out to be the case",
