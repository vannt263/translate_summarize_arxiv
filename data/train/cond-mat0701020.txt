    "kagome antiferromagnets are among the most extreme examples of frustrated spin systems realized with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "both the frustration in each triangular unit and the rather loose `` corner - sharing '' aggregation of these units into the kagome lattice suppress the tendency to magnetically order . on the classical level , kagome spin systems are known to exhibit rather special properties : nearest - neighbor ising and xy models remain disordered even in the zero - temperature limit , while the @xmath2 system undergoes order - by - disorder into a coplanar spin structure.@xcite    quantum kagome antiferromagnets , which are much less understood , provide a fascinating arena for the possible realization of spin liquids .",
    "early exact diagonalization and series expansion studies@xcite as well as further exhaustive numerical works , @xcite provide strong evidence for the absence of any magnetic order or other symmetry breaking in the nearest neighbor spin-1/2 system .",
    "moreover , a plethora of low energy singlet excitations is found , below a small ( if non - zero ) spin gap .",
    "but the precise nature of the putative spin liquid phase in this model has remained elusive .    on the experimental front ,",
    "several quasi - two dimensional materials with magnetic moments in a kagome arrangement have been studied , including srcr@xmath3ga@xmath4o@xmath5 with cr@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) moments@xcite , jarosites km@xmath8(oh)@xmath9(so@xmath10)@xmath11 with m@xmath12cr@xmath6 or fe@xmath6 ( @xmath13 ) moments@xcite , and volborthite cu@xmath8v@xmath14o@xmath15(oh)@xmath16 2h@xmath14o with cu@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) moments@xcite .",
    "recently , herbertsmithite zncu@xmath8(oh)@xmath9cl@xmath14 which also has cu@xmath17 moments on a kagome lattice was synthesized for which no magnetic order is observed down to 50 mk despite the estimated exchange constant of 300  k. @xcite the second layer of @xmath19he absorbed on graphoile is also believed to realize the kagome magnet.@xcite the suppression of long - range spin correlations or other signs of symmetry breaking down to temperatures much lower than the characteristic exchange energy scale is manifest in all of these materials , consistent with expectations .",
    "moreover , there is evidence for low energy excitations , both spin carrying and singlets .",
    "but the ultimate zero - temperature spin liquid state is often masked in these systems by magnetic ordering or glassy behavior at the lowest temperatures , perhaps due to additional interactions or impurities , rendering the experimental study of the spin liquid properties problematic .",
    "new materials and other experimental developments are changing this situation , and the question of the quantum spin liquid ground state of the kagome antiferromagnet is becoming more prominent .",
    "there are two broad classes of spin liquids which have been explored theoretically , both in general terms and for the kagome antiferromagnet in particular .",
    "the first class comprise the `` topological '' spin liquids , which have a gap to all excitations and have particle - like excitations with fractional quantum numbers above the gap . arguably , the simplest topological liquids are the so - called @xmath20 spin liquids , which support a vortex like excitation - a vison - in addition to the spin one - half spinon . for the kagome antiferromagnet , sachdev  @xcite and more recently wang and vishwanath  @xcite",
    "have employed a schwinger boson approach to systematically access several different @xmath20 spin liquids . for a kagome antiferromagnet with easy axis anisotropy and further neighbor interactions ,",
    "balents@xcite unambiguously established the presence of a @xmath20 spin liquid , obtaining an exact ground state wavefunction in a particular limit .",
    "quantum dimer models on the kagome lattice can also support a @xmath20 topological phase@xcite .",
    "spin liquids with topological order and time reversal symmetry breaking , the chiral spin liquids which are closely analogous to fractional quantum hall states , have been found on the kagome lattice@xcite within a fermionic representation of the spins . but all of these topological liquids are gapped , and can not account for the presence of many low excitations found in the exact diagonalization studies and suggested by the experiments .    a second class of spin liquids - the `` critical '' or `` algebraic spin liquids '' ( asl ) -",
    "have gapless singlet and spin carrying excitations .",
    "although these spin liquids share many properties with quantum critical points such as correlation functions falling off as power laws with non - trivial exponents , they are believed to be stable quantum phases of matter . within a fermionic representation of the spins ,",
    "hastings@xcite explored an algebraic spin liquid on the kagome lattice , and more recently ran@xcite have extended his analysis in an attempt to explain the observed properties of herbertsmithite zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath21cl@xmath11 .    in this paper , motivated by the experiments on the kagome materials and the numerical studies , we pursue",
    "yet a different approach to the possible spin liquid state of the kagome antiferromagnet . as detailed below , for a kagome antiferromagnet with easy - plane anisotropy",
    "we find evidence for a new critical spin liquid , an `` algebraic vortex liquid '' ( avl ) phase .",
    "earlier we had introduced and explored the avl in the context of the triangular xxz antiferromagnet in refs .  .",
    "compared to the slave particle techniques for studying frustrated quantum antiferromagnets , the avl approach is less microscopically faithful to a specific spin hamiltonian , but has the virtue of being unbiased .",
    "our approach requires the presence of an easy - plane anisotropy , which for a spin one - half system can come from the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , although this is usually quite small .",
    "but for higher half - integer spin systems , spin - orbit coupling allows for a single ion anisotropy @xmath22 which can be appreciable . with @xmath23",
    "this leads to an easy - plane spin character , and from a symmetry stand point our analysis should be relevant .",
    "moreover , a very interesting unpublished exact diagonalization study by sindzingre @xcite suggests that an unusual spin liquid phase is also realized for the nearest - neighbor quantum xy antiferromagnet .",
    "he finds a small gap to @xmath24 excitations , but below this gap there is a plethora of @xmath25 states , which is reminiscent of the many singlet excitations below the triplet gap in the heisenberg su(2 ) spin model.@xcite thus , based on the exact diagonalization studies , the easy plane anisotropy does not appear to gap out the putative critical spin liquid of the heisenberg model , although it will presumably modify its detailed character .",
    "our approach to easy - plane frustrated quantum antiferromagnets focuses on vortex defects in the spin configurations , rather than the spins themselves . in this picture",
    ", the magnetically ordered phases do not have vortices present in the ground state .",
    "but there will be gapped vortices , and these can lead to important effects on the spectrum .",
    "for example , vortex - antivortex ( i.e. roton ) excitations can lead to minima in the structure factor at particular wavevectors in the brillouin zone , @xcite in analogy to superfluid he-4 . as we demonstrated for the triangular antiferromagnet and explore below for the kagome lattice ,",
    "our approach predicts specific locations in the brillouin zone for the roton minima , which could perhaps be checked by high order spin wave expansion techniques . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of mobile vortex defects in the ground state can destroy magnetic order , giving access to various quantum paramagnets . if the vortices themselves condense , the usual result is the breaking of lattice symmetries , such as in a spin peierls state .",
    "but if the vortices remain gapless one can access a critical spin liquid phase .    for",
    "frustrated spin models the usual duality transformation to vortex degrees of freedom does not resolve the geometric frustration since the vortices are at finite density .",
    "however , by binding @xmath26-flux to each vortex converting them into fermions coupled to a chern - simons gauge field followed by a simple flux - smearing mean - field treatment gives a simple way to describe the vortices .",
    "the long - range interaction of vortices actually works to our advantage here since it suppresses their density fluctuations and leads essentially to incompressibility of the vortex fluid . as demonstrated in the easy - plane quantum antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice,@xcite including fluctuations about the flux - smeared mean field enables one to access a critical spin liquid with gapless vortices .",
    "the theory has the structure of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional [ ( 2 + 1)d ] quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath0 ) , with relativistic fermionic vortices minimally coupled to a non - compact u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "the resulting algebraic vortex liquid ( avl ) phase is a novel critical spin liquid phase that exhibits neither magnetic nor any other symmetry - breaking order .",
    "this approach also allows one to study many competing orders in the vicinity of the gapless phase .",
    "when applied to the spin-1/2 easy - plane antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice , the duality transformation combined with fermionization and flux smearing also leads to a low - energy effective qed@xmath0 theory with 8 flavors of dirac fermions with an emergent @xmath1 flavor symmetry .",
    "amusingly , avl s with @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite emergent symmetries were obtained previously for quantum xy antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice , with integer spin , half - integer spin and half - integer spin in an applied magnetic field , respectively .",
    "qed@xmath30 theory with @xmath31 flavors of dirac fermions is known to realize a stable critical phase for sufficiently large @xmath32 .",
    "while numerical attempts to determine @xmath33 are so far inconclusive,@xcite an estimate from the large-@xmath31 expansion suggests @xmath34.@xcite it seems very likely that @xmath35 is large enough , implying the presence of a stable critical spin liquid ground state for the easy - plane spin-1/2 quantum antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice .",
    "although the algebraic vortex liquid and the algebraic spin liquid@xcite obtained for the kagome lattice are accessed in rather different ways , they share a number of commonalities , both theoretically and with regard to their experimental implications . both approaches end with a qed@xmath0 theory , the former a non - compact gauge field theory with fermionic vortices carrying an emergent su(8 ) symmetry , and the latter a compact gauge theory with fermionic spinons with su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "the non - compact nature of the gauge field in the avl follows from the fact that the @xmath36 component of spin appears as the gauge flux in the dualized theory .",
    "hence the states with zero flux and @xmath26 flux are physically distinct ; moreover , it follows that since the total @xmath36 is conserved , so also is the total gauge flux .",
    "this should be contrasted with the slave particle approach , where a compact gauge theory arises on the lattice and there is no such conservation law .",
    "physically , this means that dynamical monopole operators , which could potentially destabilize the spin liquid and open a gap in the excitation spectrum , are not allowed in our low - energy theory for the avl , while they are allowed in a low - energy description of spin liquids obtained using a slave particle framework .    with regard to experimentally accessible quantities",
    ", both theories predict a power law specific heat @xmath37 at low temperatures , which follows from the linear dispersion of the fermions , and which would dominate the phonon contribution to the specific heat for magnets with exchange interactions significantly smaller that the debye frequency .",
    "@xcite because the spinons couple directly to magnetic fields , one would expect the specific heat in the asl to be more sensitive to an external applied magnetic field than the avl phase .",
    "both theories predict a thermal conductivity which vanishes as @xmath38 , @xcite which is an interesting experimental signature reflecting the dynamical mobility of the gapless excitations .",
    "the momentum resolved dynamical spin structure factor which can be extracted from inelastic neutron experiments can in principle give very detailed information about the spin dynamics . following the framework developed on the triangular lattice,@xcite for the kagome avl",
    "we can extract the wavevectors in the magnetic brillouin zone which have gapless spin carrying excitations , and find 12 of them as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : enhbilin.eps ] .",
    "in contrast , the kagome asl phase is predicted to have gapless spin excitations at only 4 of these 12 momenta .",
    "the momentum space location of the gapless excitations is perhaps the best way to try and distinguish experimentally between these two ( and any other ) critical spin liquids .",

    "some details of the analysis are presented in three appendices .",

    "we consider the system with dominant nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath41 , but will also allow some second- and third - neighbor exchanges @xmath42 and @xmath43 . to set the stage , the model with only nearest - neighbor coupling has an extensive degeneracy of classical ground states , which is lifted by further - neighbor interactions .",
    "for example , with antiferromagnetic @xmath44 , the so - called @xmath45 phase is stabilized ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_lattice ] ) . on the other hand , for ferromagnetic @xmath46 ,",
    "the so - called @xmath47 structure is the classical ground state ( fig .",

    "these ordered phases are also realized in the quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg model for large enough @xmath42@xcite , while the case with @xmath48 is most challenging as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the easy - plane spin system can be readily reformulated in terms of vortices .",
    "but in order to apply the fermionized vortex approach more simply , we consider a wider class of models which includes the nearest - neighbor kagome model .",
    "specifically , we add one extra site at the center of each hexagon , on which we put an integer spin ( fig .  [",

    "we have dropped the @xmath55 term for simplicity since it amounts to a mere renormalization of the interactions in the effective field theory that we will derive .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_lattice ] , we take the interaction to be @xmath56 for the nearest neighbor half - integer spins , while the coupling that connects integer and half - integer spins is @xmath57 .",
    "when the on - site interaction @xmath58 is infinitely large , @xmath59 , there remain two low - energy states realizing the hilbert space of a @xmath18 spin at the kagome sites , whereas the frozen sector with @xmath60 is selected at the hexagon center sites . in the quantum rotor model ,",
    "we `` soften '' this constraint and take @xmath58 to be finite .",
    "the additional integer - spin degrees of freedom do not spoil any symmetries of the original model , which for the record include lattice translations , reflections , and rotations , as well as xy spin symmetries .",
    "if we integrate over the extra degrees of freedom , the model looks very close to the original one .",
    "for example , in the limit when @xmath61 , we obtain the kagome model with additional ferromagnetic second and third neighbor exchanges @xmath62 , together with a renormalized nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath63 .",
    "such exchanges would slightly favor the @xmath64 state in the classical limit , but as we will see , the spin liquid phase that we obtain by analyzing the extended kagome model will have enhanced correlations corresponding to both the @xmath45 and @xmath64 phases that are nearby . thus the small bias introduced by the added integer - spin sites appears to be not so important for the generic spin liquid phase that we want to describe .",

    "<S> there is growing evidence from both experiment and numerical studies that low half - odd integer quantum spins on a kagome lattice with predominant antiferromagnetic near neighbor interactions do not order magnetically or break lattice symmetries even at temperatures much lower than the exchange interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there appear to be a plethora of low energy excitations , predominantly singlets but also spin carrying , which suggest that the putative underlying quantum spin liquid is a gapless `` critical spin liquid '' rather than a gapped spin liquid with topological order . here , we develop an effective field theory approach for the spin-1/2 heisenberg model with easy - plane anisotropy on the kagome lattice . by employing a vortex duality transformation , followed by a fermionization and flux - smearing , we obtain access to a gapless yet stable critical spin liquid phase , which is described by ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath0 ) with an emergent @xmath1 flavor symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat , thermal conductivity , and dynamical structure factor are extracted from the effective field theory , and contrasted with other theoretical approaches to the kagome antiferromagnet . </S>"
