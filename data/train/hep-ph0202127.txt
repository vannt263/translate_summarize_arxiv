    "recently , we have proposed a simple proof of collinear factorization theorem in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) for the exclusive processes @xmath6 and @xmath7 based on the ward identity @xcite . according to this theorem @xcite",
    ", hadronic form factors are factorized into the convolution of hard amplitudes with hadron distribution amplitudes in momentum , spin , and color spaces .",
    "the former , being infrared finite , are calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "the latter , absorbing the infrared divergences involved in the processes , are defined as matrix elements of nonlocal operators .",
    "the universality of the distribution amplitudes and the gauge invariance of the factorization have been explicitly demonstrated .",
    "our proof can be compared to that performed in the axial gauge @xcite , in which the factorization of infrared divergences is trivial , but the gauge invariance is not obvious .",
    "the formalism in @xcite is restricted to the leading - twist , _",
    "i.e. _ , twist-2 level .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , contributions from the two - parton twist-3 pion distribution amplitudes are not only chirally enhanced , but of the same power as the leading - twist one in the semileptonic decay @xmath8 .",
    "hence , it is necessary to derive the corresponding factorization theorem .",
    "this proof can be regarded as an essential step toward a rigorous construction of factorization theorem for two - body nonleptonic @xmath5 meson decays .",
    "the general decompositions of the matrix elements relevant to the two - parton pion distribution amplitudes are , quoted from @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distribution amplitudes of unit normalization , @xmath12 the pion decay constant , @xmath13 the pion mass , @xmath14 the momentum fraction associated with the @xmath15 quark evaluated at the coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "the wilson links that render the above nonlocal matrix elements gauge invariant are not shown explicitly .",
    "it is easy to observe that the contribution from @xmath17 , independent of the pion mass , is twist-2 , and the contribution from @xmath11 is twist-4 because of the factor @xmath18 .",
    "the contributions from the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) distribution amplitude @xmath19 and from the pseudo - tensor ( pt ) distribution amplitude @xmath20 , proportional to the chiral enhancing scale @xmath21 , are twist-3 .",
    "we concentrate on the factorization of the two - parton twist-3 distribution amplitudes @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we shall not consider the three - parton twist-3 distribution amplitudes here , since their contributions to exclusive processes are suppressed by the strong coupling constant and of higher power .",
    "the reason is as follows : after factorizing the corresponding infrared divergences to all orders , the contribution is written as a convolution of a hard amplitude with the three - parton twist-3 distribution amplitudes .",
    "the hard amplitude contains one more attachment from the extra parton ( gluon ) compared to that in the two - parton case .",
    "the attachment introduces one more power of the coupling constant , and one more hard propagator proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a large scale characterizing the hard amplitude .",
    "hence , a three - parton hard amplitude is at least down by a power of the coupling constant and a power of @xmath22 compared to the leading - order leading - twist hard amplitude .",
    "moreover , the three - parton twist-3 distribution amplitudes should be considered along with the two - parton @xmath24 distribution amplitudes , which form a complete gauge - invariant set .",
    "nonperturbative dynamics is reflected by infrared divergences of radiative corrections in perturbation theory .",
    "there are two types of infrared divergences , soft and collinear .",
    "soft divergences come from the region of a loop momentum @xmath25 , where all its components diminish .",
    "collinear divergences are associated with a massless quark of momentum @xmath26 . in the soft region and in the collinear region with @xmath25 parallel to @xmath27 , the components of @xmath25 behave like @xmath28 respectively , where the light - cone coordinates have been adopted , and @xmath29 is a small hadronic scale . in both regions the invariant mass of the radiated gluon diminishes as @xmath30 , and",
    "the corresponding loop integrand may diverge as @xmath31 . as the phase space for loop integration vanishes like @xmath32 ,",
    "logarithmic divergences are generated .    in this paper",
    "we shall derive the collinear factorization formula for the scattering process @xmath0 , which involves the pion form factor , at twist-3 by means of the ward identity .",
    "the chirally enhanced contributions to the pion form factor have been calculated in @xcite without proving their factorization theorem .",
    "it will be shown that soft divergences cancel and collinear divergences , factored out of the processes order by order , are absorbed into the two - parton twist-3 pion distribution amplitudes defined by the nonlocal matrix elements , @xmath33u(0)|\\pi^+(p ) \\rangle\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\phi_t(x)&\\equiv & \\frac{1}{6}\\frac{d}{dx}\\phi_\\sigma(x)\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ & = & i\\frac{p^+}{m_0}\\int\\frac{dy^-}{2\\pi}e^{ixp^+y^- } \\langle 0|{\\bar d}(y^-)\\gamma_5(\\not\\ !",

    "the definition of the hard amplitudes at each order will be given as a result of the proof .",
    "we then prove the collinear factorization theorem for the semileptonic decay @xmath1 , whose topology is similar to the scattering process @xmath0 . in the heavy quark limit the mass difference between the @xmath5 meson and the @xmath37 quark , @xmath38 , represents a small scale .",
    "assuming the hard scale to be of @xmath2 , the soft divergences do not cancel on the @xmath5 meson side , and the @xmath5 meson distribution amplitudes are introduced to absorb the soft divergences .",
    "the distinction between the factorization of soft divergences for the @xmath5 meson distribution amplitudes and the factorization of collinear divergences for the pion distribution amplitudes will be explained .",
    "it will be shown that the two - parton twist-3 pion distribution amplitudes derived from the scattering @xmath39 and from the decay @xmath1 are identical as defined by eq .",
    "( [ pwt ] ) .",
    "that is , the universality of hadron distribution amplitudes is confirmed .",
    "there are different opinions on whether the transverse degrees of freedom of partons should be involved in exclusive @xmath5 meson decays @xcite .",
    "the conclusion drawn in @xcite that the parton transverse momenta @xmath24 are not necessary is based on the analysis of the @xmath40 decay , for which the collinear factorization formula does not develop an end - point singularity .",
    "when end - point singularities appear @xcite , for example , in the collinear factorization formulas of semileptonic and nonleptonic decays , the region with a small momentum fraction @xmath14 becomes important . in this end - point region",
    "the parton @xmath24 should be taken into account , and @xmath24 factorization theorem @xcite is more appropriate .",
    "here we shall derive the collinear factorization formalism for exclusive @xmath5 meson decays .",
    "the @xmath24 dependence can be introduced straightforwardly following the procedure in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the proof of factorization theorem is not the whole story of pqcd .",
    "the double logarithms @xmath41 appearing in higher - order corrections to exclusive @xmath5 meson decays have been observed @xcite . when the end - point region is important , @xmath41 can not be treated as a small expansion parameter , and should be summed to all orders .",
    "a systematic treatment of these logarithms has been proposed by grouping them into a quark jet function @xcite , whose dependence on @xmath14 is governed by an evolution equation @xcite . a sudakov factor , obtained by solving the evolution equation , decreases fast at the end point . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath24 factorization theorem is adopted , @xmath24 resummation is also required , which leads to another sudakov factor describing the parton distribution in @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in a self - consistent analysis the original factorization formulas should be convoluted with the above two sudakov factors .",
    "it turns out that the end - point singularities do not exist @xcite , and an arbitrary infrared cutoff for the momentum fraction @xmath14 @xcite is not required .    in the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )",
    "@xcite , an effective lagrangian with high - energy modes integrated out has been constructed .",
    "this scet lagrangian provides a simple guideline for deriving a factorization formula by counting the powers of effective operators : start with an effective operator relevant for a high - energy qcd process , and draw the diagrams based on the scet lagrangians .",
    "those effective diagrams , whose contributions scale like the power the same as of the operator , contribute to the matrix element formed by the operator .",
    "this matrix element is identified as the nonperturbative distribution amplitude , which collects the infrared divergences in the process .",
    "the wilson coefficient ( the hard amplitude ) associated with the considered operator is then obtained by subtracting the effective diagrams from the full diagrams ( the matching between the full theory and the effective theory ) .",
    "an example for the application of scet , the collinear factorization of the @xmath42 decays , can be found in @xcite . we shall compare the above formalism with ours at the end of this paper . for a detailed comparison ,",
    "refer to @xcite .",
    "we mention the opinion from the qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , which claims that the @xmath43 form factor , suffering the end - point singularity in collinear factorization , is dominated by soft dynamics . for a debate on this issue , refer to @xcite .",
    "we have explained that the opposite conclusions on the dominant dynamics in exclusive @xmath5 meson decays are attributed to the different theoretical frameworks @xcite : a transition form factor is factorizable in pqcd , i.e. , in @xmath24 factorization as explained above , not factorizable in qcdf , i.e. , in collinear factorization ( speaking of only the leading contribution ) @xcite , and partially factorizable in scet @xcite ( non - singular and singular pieces in collinear factorization are written into factorizable and nonfactorizable forms , respectively ) .",
    "hence , there is no conflict at all among the above observations .",
    "it has been pointed out that the collinear factorization and the @xmath24 factorization lead to different phenomenological predictions for nonleptonic @xmath5 meson decays , such as the cp asymmetries in the @xmath44 modes @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the comparison with experimental data can discriminate the above approaches .    in sec .",
    "ii we derive the @xmath45 factorization of the collinear divergences in the process @xmath0 .",
    "the delicate summation of a complete set of diagrams for achieving the factorizations in momentum , spin , and color spaces is emphasized .",
    "the all - order proof based on the ward identity is presented in sec .",
    "the absence of the soft divergences is also shown .",
    "the technique is then generalized to the decay @xmath1 in sec .",
    "the factorizations of soft divergences for the @xmath5 meson distribution amplitudes and of collinear divergences for the pion distribution amplitudes are compared .",
    "section v is the conclusion .",
    "we refer the detailed calculations of the @xmath45 infrared divergences in the above two processes to appendices a , b , and c.",
    "we start with the two - parton twist-3 factorization of the process @xmath0 at the one - loop level , which will serve as a starting point of the all - order proof .",
