    "the standard cosmological model explains observations only under the circumstance that almost all matter and energy of the universe are hidden in some unknown _ dark _ forms . in my model of low - energy quantum gravity based on the idea of an existence of the background of super - strong interacting gravitons ( for more details , see @xcite ) , a cosmological redshift is caused by interactions of photons with gravitons .",
    "non - forehead collisions with gravitons lead to a very specific additional relaxation of any photonic flux that gives a possibility of another interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics or dark energy @xcite .",
    "i would like to summarize here the main cosmologically essential consequences of this model .",
    "average energy losses of a photon with an energy @xmath4 on a way @xmath5 through the graviton background will be equal to : @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 is the hubble constant . if we introduce a new dimensional constant @xmath9 , so that : @xmath10 @xmath11 is a cross - section of interaction by forehead collisions of a photon with an energy @xmath12 and a graviton with an energy @xmath13 then we can compute the hubble constant in this approach : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an average graviton energy , and @xmath16 is a temperature of the background .",
    "the constant @xmath9 should have the value : @xmath17 the one may be found from the newtonian limit of gravity . if @xmath18 is a geometrical distance from a source , then we have for @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a redshift : @xmath21 none - forehead collisions of photons with gravitons of the background will lead to a scatter of photons and to an additional relaxation of a photonic flux , so that the luminosity distance @xmath22 is equal in this approach to : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath25 this luminosity distance function fits supernova observations very well for roughly @xmath26 . it excludes a need of any dark energy to explain supernovae dimming .    in this paper ,",
    "i consider galaxy number counts / redshift and counts / magnitude relations on a basis of this model .",
    "i assume here that a space is flat and the universe is not expanding .",
    "total galaxy number counts @xmath27 for a volume element @xmath28 is equal to : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a galaxy number density ( it is constant in the no - evolution scenario ) , @xmath31 is a solid angle element . using the function @xmath19 of this model",
    ", we can re - write galaxy number counts as a function of a redshift @xmath20 : @xmath32 let us introduce a function ( see @xcite ) @xmath33 then we have for it in this model : @xmath34 a graph of this function is shown in fig . 1 ; the typical error bar and data point are added here from paper @xcite by loh and spillar .",
    "there is not a visible contradiction with observations .",
    "_ there is not any free parameter in the model to fit this curve ; _ it is a very rigid case .    = 12.98 cm    it is impossible to count a _ total _ galaxy number for big redshifts so as very faint galaxies are not observable . for objects with a fixed luminosity ,",
    "it is easy to find how their magnitude @xmath2 changes with a redshift .",
    "so as @xmath35 under a constant luminosity is equal to : @xmath36 we have for @xmath37 @xmath38 this function is shown in fig.2 for @xmath39    = 12.98 cm    i would like to note that a very fast _ initial _ growth of the luminosity distance with a redshift @xmath20 in this model might explain the observed excess of faint blue galaxy number counts above an expected one in the standard model ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "a galaxy color depends on a redshift , and a galaxy dimming depends on the luminosity distance , because by big values of the ratio @xmath40 in a region of small redshifts and by a further much slower change of it ( see fig.3 ) an observer will see many faint but blue enough galaxies in this region ( in the no - evolution scenario ) .",
    "galaxies have different luminosities @xmath41 and we can write @xmath30 as an integral : @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 is the galaxy luminosity function . i shall use here the schechter luminosity function @xcite : @xmath45 with the parameters @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 for negative values of @xmath49 all computations are performed here for @xmath50 so as we have by a definition of the luminosity distance @xmath51 that a light flux @xmath52 is equal to : @xmath53 and a visible magnitude @xmath2 of an object is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant , then @xmath2 is equal to : @xmath56 we can write for @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 for a thin layer with @xmath60 we have : @xmath61 where @xmath62 then @xmath63 where @xmath64 corresponds to decreasing @xmath2 by growing @xmath65 when @xmath66 and @xmath67    let us introduce a function @xmath68 with a differential @xmath69 we have for this differential in the model : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath8 is the hubble constant .",
    "an integral on @xmath20 gives the galaxy number counts / magnitude relation : @xmath72 i use here an upper limit @xmath73 to compare this function with observations by yasuda et al .",
    "@xcite , let us choose the normalizing factor from the condition : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the function assuming `` euclidean '' geometry and giving the best fit to observations @xcite , @xmath76 depends on the spectral band . in this case",
    ", we have two free parameters - @xmath77 and @xmath78 - to fit observations , and the latter one is connected with a constant @xmath79 if @xmath80    if we use the magnitude scale in which @xmath81 for vega then @xmath82 and we get for @xmath83 by @xmath84 ( it is a theoretical estimate of @xmath8 in this model @xcite ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the sun luminosity ; the following values are used : @xmath87 the distance to vega @xmath88    without the factor @xmath89 the function @xmath90 by @xmath91 would be close to @xmath92 by @xmath93 matching values of @xmath77 shows that @xmath90 is the closest to @xmath92 in the range @xmath94 by @xmath95 the ratio @xmath96 is shown in fig.4 for different values of @xmath83 by this value of @xmath77 .",
    "all such the curves conflow by    = 12.98 cm    @xmath97 ( or @xmath98 ) , i.e. observations of the galaxy number counts / magnitude relation are _ non - sensitive _ to @xmath83 in this range . for fainter magnitudes",
    "@xmath99 , the behavior of all curves is identical : they go below of the ratio value @xmath100 with the same slope .",
    "if we compare this figure with figs .",
    "6,10,12 from @xcite , we see that the considered model provides a no - worse fit to observations than the function @xmath92 if the same k - corrections are added ( i think that even a better one if one takes into account positions of observational points in figs . 6,10,12 from @xcite by @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) for the range @xmath103 that corresponds to @xmath104    observations of @xmath1 for different magnitudes are a lot more informative . if we define a function @xmath105 as @xmath106 this function is equal in the model to : @xmath107    galaxy number counts in the range @xmath108 are proportional to the function : @xmath109 @xmath110    = 10.98 cm    graphs of both @xmath105 and @xmath111 are shown in fig . 5 by @xmath112 ; they are very similar between themselves .",
    "we see that even the observational fact that a number of visible galaxies by @xmath113 is very small allows us to restrict a value of the parameter @xmath83 much stronger than observations of @xmath114 .",
    "for quasars , we can attempt to compute the galaxy number counts / redshift relation using eq . 16 with another luminosity function @xmath115 : @xmath116 the following luminosity functions were probed here ( see fig .",
    "6 ) : the schechter one with @xmath117 , @xmath118 ( blue ) ; the double power law @xcite : @xmath119 with @xmath120 ( green ) ; the gaussian one : @xmath121 with @xmath122 ( brown , dot ) ; the combined one : @xmath123 with two sets of parameters : @xmath124 ( red , solid ) and @xmath125 ( red , dot ) .",
    "there is a couple of    = 12.98 cm    curves for each case : the left - shifted curve of any couple corresponds to the range @xmath126 another one corresponds to @xmath127 these ranges are chosen the same as in the paper by croom et al .",
    "@xcite , and you may compare this figure with fig . 3 in @xcite .",
    "we can see that the theoretical distributions reflect only some features of the observed ones but not an entire picture .",
    "in all these cases , a slope of an analog of @xmath128 near @xmath129 is in the range 0.29 - 0.325 , when quasar observations give a larger slope ( see fig . 4 , 21 in @xcite and fig .",
    "13 in @xcite ; in the latter paper , this slope has been evaluated to be equal to about 1 ) .",
    "we can summarize that , as well as in the standard cosmological model , it is impossible to fit quasar observations using some simple luminosity function with fixed parameters .    in the standard model , an easy way exists to turn aside this difficulty : one ascribes it to a quasar `` evolution '' , then a luminosity function ( for example , the double power law @xcite ) is modified for different redshifts to take into account this `` evolution '' . there",
    "exist two manner to do it : one may consider @xmath78 as a function of a redshift ( pure luminosity evolution ) @xcite or one may assume that indices @xmath77 and @xmath130 of the distribution ( double power law ) vary with @xmath20 @xcite - in both variants , it is possible to fit observations in some range of redshifts ; of course , there are many other descriptions of the `` evolution '' @xcite .",
    "it is strange only that `` evolutions '' are not concerted : we can see exponential , quadratic and other kinds of them - and it means that there is not any real evolution : we deal with a pure fine art of fitting , nothing more . in the considered model , this way is forbidden .",
    "i think that it is necessary to consider some theoretical model of a quasar activity to get a distribution of `` instantaneous '' luminosities .",
    "it is known that the typical lifetime of individual quasars is uncertain by several orders of magnitude ; a lifetime of @xmath131 years may be considered as an average value @xcite . if one considers a quasar light curve @xmath132 ( in a manner which is similar to the one by hopkins et al .",
    "@xcite ) in a parametric form , it is possible to get the luminosity function which takes into account a probability to observe a quasar with a given luminosity . let us consider the two simple examples . the simplest case is a constant luminosity @xmath65 of any quasar during its lifetime @xmath133 .",
    "if initial moments of quasar activity are distributed uniformly in time and may be described by a frequency @xmath134 , then a probability @xmath135 to observe a quasar will be equal to : @xmath136 for @xmath137 we have @xmath138 if we further assume that @xmath139 i.e. that a full emitted quasar energy is constant , then a distribution of observable luminosities is @xmath140 where @xmath141 is an initial distribution of values of @xmath65 .",
    "the second example is the quasar exponential light curve : @xmath142 where @xmath133 is a lifetime , @xmath143 is an initial luminosity .",
    "if @xmath143 has a distribution @xmath144 , then we get : @xmath145^{-1}\\cdot ( l_{0}/l)^{2-\\nu\\tau(l_{0})}\\cdot dl_{0},\\ ] ] where @xmath146 is a maximum time during which one can distinguish a quasar from a host galaxy , and @xmath133 depends on @xmath143 in some manner .",
    "we see that even in this simple toy example the dependence on @xmath133 is not trivial .    in a general case ,",
    "it is necessary to describe both - front and back - slopes of a quasar light curve .",
    "together with a total emitted energy ( or a peak luminosity ) , we need at least three independent parameters ; if we take into account their random distributions , this number should be at least doubled .",
    "starting from a micro level and considering interactions of photons with single gravitons , we can find the luminosity distance and a geometrical distance in this approach . using only these quantities ,",
    "i compute here galaxy number counts - redshift and galaxy number counts - magnitude relations for a case of a flat non - expanding universe .",
    "it has been shown here that they are in a good accordance with observations .",
    "it may be important as for cosmology as for a theory of gravity .",
