    "higgs decay to top - antitop pairs could be a search channel in a variety of models where the corresponding branching ratio ( br ) becomes dominant , owing to the fact that , in some such models , the competing higgs decays into @xmath8 and @xmath9 pairs can be suppressed or non - existent .",
    "for example , in the case of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , this naturally occurs if the decaying higgs boson is the cp - odd one , @xmath10 , but also for the heavy cp - even one , @xmath11 , when @xmath12 ( see @xcite for the definition of @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the relevant mssm feynman rules ) . in this case , which is generally realised for @xmath15 gev , @xmath16 becomes a feasible search channel @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , lep ( and now also tevatron and lhc ) limits almost exclude entirely the region of the @xmath17 plane of the mssm where significances above 5 can be achieved @xcite . on the other hand , in a generic 2-higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , one can easily switch off the higgs couplings to gauge boson pairs , as the trigonometric factor which controls this coupling is essentially a free parameter ( unlike the case of the mssm ) , whilst still being consistent with lep ( and more recent tevatron and lhc ) data @xcite . furthermore , even in those models where the scope of the higgs @xmath18 decay channel may be limited , once a higgs boson is found and its parameters ( mass primarily , but possibly also width and discrete quantum numbers ) measured , these can subsequently be exploited in the selection of the @xmath19 final state to render the higgs visible @xcite .",
    "this can be done , for example , for the purpose of measuring the corresponding br , thereby accessing the higgs-@xmath1 coupling , in the attempt to profile the new resonance .",
    "therefore , it remains of the utmost importance to continue assessing the scope of existing colliders in extracting the higgs @xmath18 signal , not least because , from a theoretical point of view , the yukawa coupling between a higgs boson and the top quark entering its rates is a parameter which generally plays a key role in the dynamics of any beyond the standard model ( bsm ) scenario based on a higgs mechanism : e.g. , in its electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) transition , in the renormalisation group equations ( rges ) describing its evolution from high to low energy scales , etc . finally , one should recall that the top(anti - top)-quark decays into a bottom(anti - bottom)-quark and a @xmath20 boson rather than hadronising , thereby transmitting its spin properties to the decay products very efficiently , so that the spin and cp nature of the higgs boson(s ) involved can be explored in suitable experimental observables @xcite .    clearly , in order to perform all the relevant searches for higgs @xmath18 events , any source of sm corrections should be well - understood .",
    "this is true for the case of the higgs signal , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "regarding the qcd background , @xmath22 , complete one - loop results exist for both the qcd @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and ew @xcite ( see also @xcite ) sectors .",
    "however , it is also of crucial importance to take into account interference effects between the above signal and background ( limited to the @xmath4 channel ) @xcite .",
    "concerning such an interference , it is well known in the literature @xcite that higgs bosons produced via @xmath4 fusion and decaying into top - antitop quark pairs interfere with the background @xmath7-channel lo qcd diagrams to produce a peak - dip structure in the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this structure has been claimed as potentially observable at the lhc .",
    "we point out here that , if one properly includes through the perturbative order at which this effect emerges , i.e. , @xmath0 , all other diagrams , such an effect is generally subleading with respect to those induced by all other ( non - resonant ) higgs graphs appearing through that order and/or the ones due to all other ( non - higgs ) diagrams , the latter being always the dominant contribution .",
    "( we neglect here the @xmath23 channel , as this is negligible at the lhc and does not involve a resonant higgs contribution . )    the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe our calculation . in sect .",
    "iii we report on our numerical results .",
    "finally , we conclude in sect .",
    "iv .     via a higgs produced in the @xmath2-channel . ]",
    "( excluding gluon crossings ) . ]",
    "the computation exploited in this paper is described at length in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we do not dwell here on the technical details . rather , we just recall the salient features of the calculation , with a view at emphasising the role of the diagrams with an intermediate higgs boson .    for the complete ew corrections we need to consider all graphs containing a weakly ( or electromagnetically ) interacting internal particle",
    ". graphs involving an internal higgs are shown in figs .",
    "[ fdh1][fdh2 ] , where fig .",
    "[ fdh1 ] is the graph for the higgs produced in the @xmath2-channel .",
    "this can interfere with the lo qcd amplitude ( @xmath24- and @xmath25-channel exchanges only since interference with @xmath2-channel exchange is forbidden by colour ) .",
    "[ fdh2 ] shows all the other graphs involving a higgs , which can also interfere with ( the complete ) lo qcd amplitude .",
    "we want to compare the yield of these two interferences as well as to that of the entire set of ew corrections ( the remaining graphs have the same topology as the graphs in figs . [ fdh1][fdh2 ] , but with the higgs replaced by a gauge and/or goldstone boson . )",
    "the rates emerging through next - to - lo ( nlo ) qcd will also be presented for reference .",
    "notice that we only include here weak effects , thereby neglecting one - loop diagrams ( and accompanying tree - level bremsstrahlung graphs ) involving a photon .",
    "these were computed in @xcite and found to be negligibly small .",
    "this is expected since qed corrections ( after accounting for bremsstrahlung ) see no large enhancement at the lhc , unlike the case of the weak ones , which are affected by large so - called sudakov logarithms of @xmath26 .    for the top mass and width we have taken @xmath27 gev and @xmath28 gev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath29 mass used was @xmath30 gev and was related to the @xmath31 mass , @xmath32 , via the sm formula @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "( corresponding widths were @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 gev . )",
    "the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) that we have used are the cteq6 set @xcite taken at the factorisation / renormalisation scale @xmath37 .",
    "( we also have checked other sets , but found no significant difference in the relative size of our corrections . )",
    "the choice of pdfs dictates the running and parameters used to compute @xmath38 , which has been taken at one - loop level in the calculation of terms of @xmath39 and @xmath0 ( in conjunction with cteq6l1 ) and at two - loop level in the computation of effects of @xmath5 ( in conjunction with cteq6 m ) .",
    "the value used throughout for the electromagnetic coupling was @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 ) .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections have been included through mcfm @xcite .",
    "finally , the higgs decay widths have been computed by means of the programs described in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "all rates are presented at the lhc energy of 14 tev , though the qualitative effects seen here would not change at 7 or at 8 tev .",
    "as the benchmark for the cp - even higgs boson case we take the sm . fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmah ] shows the contributions to the inclusive cross section from various different perturbative components . clearly , the pure qcd contribution through @xmath5 is largest ( solid line ) .",
    "( in the plots it also incorporates the lowest order @xmath39 term , dot - dashed line . ) the @xmath0 interference between the @xmath7-channel lo qcd diagrams with the one - loop @xmath2-channel higgs graph is the dotted curve , which is always negative and largest for @xmath42 just above @xmath43 .",
    "however , the dashed line , which refers to the interference with _ all _ graphs involving a higgs boson , indicates that this term is actually positive and dominated by the graphs other than the @xmath2-channel higgs exchange except in the region of @xmath42 between 250 and 550 gev , where the interference is indeed negative but has an absolute value at least an order of magnitude smaller than that obtained from the @xmath2-channel higgs exchange only . while this is a potential welcome feature through the @xmath0 , as it would increase the total signal yield , over a considerable range of @xmath42 ( notice that the square of the @xmath2-channel higgs graph through @xmath0 , diamond line , is consistently one order of magnitude or so smaller than its interference with the lo qcd terms ) , it becomes negligible if one includes all other non - higgs diagrams through @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the complete result at such a perturbative level , the starred line , is always negative and significantly larger than the partial correction obtained by only including all higgs diagrams .    figs . [ fig : massh370 ] and [ fig : massh500 ] show the differential distributions in @xmath1 invariant mass for two higgs mass values , one just above the on - shell @xmath1 threshold ( @xmath44 gev ) and another well above it ( @xmath45 gev ) , respectively .",
    "the overall trend here is the same as the one just established at inclusive level , i.e. , the salient feature is again that the full @xmath0 effects swamp those involving the @xmath2-channel higgs diagram only .",
    "curiously though , the aforementioned peak - dip structure is maintained ( compare the starred histogram with the dotted one ) , albeit a factor approximately 5(8 ) larger ( and still negative ) for @xmath46 gev .",
    "therefore , the ultimate effect through the complete @xmath0 is to swamp the higgs resonance emerging through @xmath3 .",
    "( notice that the cross sections in the legends of figs .",
    "[ fig : massh370][fig : massh500 ] are the integrated ones over the entire invariant mass range . )",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we have shown that interference effects between lo qcd amplitudes and one - loop diagrams involving weak interactions for the @xmath47 process can be large at the lhc and in fact overwhelming the well studied interference between the former and the component of the latter due to the @xmath2-channel resonant higgs diagram only .",
    "the overall effect is generally to diminish the significance of the higgs signal produced as a resonance in the gluon - gluon channel .",
    "therefore , these previously overlooked contributions need to be included in realistic simulations aiming at establishing the lhc potential to extract a higgs @xmath18 signature . we have illustrated this at the 14 tev stage of the lhc using both a cp - even and cp - odd higgs boson , the former belonging to the sm and the latter to the mssm .",
    "for further analyses , we make our program available upon request .",
