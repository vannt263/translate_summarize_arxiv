    "@xmath0  scuti stars are short - period pulsating variables of a - f spectral types , located at the intersection of the main sequence and the classical instability strip in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "typical periods are in the order of a few hours with amplitudes less than 1  mag . a prominent group within the family comprises the high - amplitude @xmath0  scuti stars ( hads ) , which have v - band amplitudes larger than 0.3  mag .",
    "population  ii members of the group are also known as sx  phoenicis stars , often found in globular clusters ( for a review of @xmath0  scuti stars see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hads s are the short - period counterparts of the classical cepheids , excited by the @xmath3-mechanism and pulsating in one or two radial modes , usually in the fundamental and first - overtone modes @xcite .",
    "the data in @xcite show that there is no rapidly rotating hads ( @xmath4  km  s@xmath2 ) , suggesting an intimate relationship between the rotational state and the excitation of pulsations . in recent years",
    ", the number of hads known with multimode oscillations has rapidly grown , hinting a new potential for asteroseismic studies of these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several investigations suggested that some of the stars may have non - radial pulsation modes present @xcite .",
    "however , an important parameter in modeling stellar oscillations is the mass of the star , which is usually constrained from evolutionary models .",
    "this will inevitably lead to great uncertainties in any kind of modeling attempts , so that independent mass estimates could be of paramount importance .",
    "thus , binary @xmath0  scutis may play a key role in understanding oscillations of these stars .",
    "there has been a great interest recently in @xmath0  scuti stars that reside in eclipsing binary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "currently , we know about 40 such @xmath0  scutis , of which only one belongs to the hads group @xcite .",
    "there are also a handful of non - eclipsing binary hads @xcite , usually deduced from the apparent cyclic period changes but with a few exceptions , like the single - lined spectroscopic binary sz  lyn .",
    "the low number of binary @xmath0  scutis suggests a strong observational bias , because one needs accurate observations with a long time span to detect multiplicity unambiguously @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our investigations into binarity and multiple periodicity in bright hads variables .",
    "the sample was initially selected from the variable star catalogue of the hipparcos satellite , which contains 21 `` sx  phe '' type stars @xcite . of these , here we discuss 9 stars ( and ry  lep in addition ) , i.e. our present sample contains almost half of all known bright hads . using a wide range of telescopes and instruments",
    ", we have been monitoring the target stars over the last five years , extending the earlier studies by our group @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations and the data analysis are described in sect .",
    "the main discussion is in sect .",
    "3 , in which the results for individual stars are presented .",
    "a brief summary is given in sect .",
    "the observed stars and their main observational properties are listed in table[obsprop ] .",
    "the full log of observations is given in table  [ obslog ] in the appendix .",
    "all data presented in this paper are available for download from the cds , strasbourg .",
    "observations were carried out using seven different instruments at five observatories in australia , hungary and the usa on a total of 65 nights between 2003 october and 2008 july . in the following",
    "we briefly describe the telescopes and the detectors used in this project , in an order of increasing mirror size :    .[obsprop ] the list of programme stars .",
    "the asterisks mark multiperiodic stars , for which this table contains the dominant period only .",
