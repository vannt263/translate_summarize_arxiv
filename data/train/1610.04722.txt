    "multistabity is a common dynamical feature of many natural systems @xcite .",
    "although it appears in diverse forms , a very frequently occurred variant is bistability .",
    "there are three main manifestations of bistability : the coexistence of ( i ) two stable steady states , ( ii ) one stable limit cycle and one stable steady state , and ( iii ) two stable limit cycles .",
    "the third form of bistability , i.e. , the coexistence of two stable limit cycles of different amplitude and frequency , generally separated by an unstable limit cycle , is called birhythmicity and oscillators showing this behavior are called birhythmic oscillators .",
    "apart from two coexisting periodic limit cycles , birhythmicity may appear in a much more complex form , e.g. , coexistence of two chaotic attractors @xcite .",
    "birhythmic oscillators are very common , particularly , in physics ( e.g. , energy harvesting system , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) biology ( e.g. glycolytic oscillator and enzymatic reactions @xcite ) and chemistry @xcite .",
    "most of the biochemical oscillations that govern the organization of cell cycle , brain dynamics or chemical oscillations are birhythmic ; examples include , birhythmicity in the p53-mdm2 network , which is the key protein module that controls proliferation of abnormal cells in mammals @xcite , intracellular ca@xmath0 oscillations @xcite , oscillatory generation of cyclic amp ( camp ) during the aggregation of the slime mold _ dictyostelium discoideum _ @xcite and circadian oscillations of the per and tim proteins in _",
    "@xcite .    in physical and engineering systems",
    "birhythmicity plays a negative role in limiting the efficiency of a certain application .",
    "take the practical example of an energy harvesting system that converts wind - induced vibrational energy into electrical energy .",
    "this type of energy harvesting systems show birhythmicity @xcite , but for an efficient harvesting it is desirable that the system always resides on the large amplitude limit cycle because that produces a significant mechanical deformation , which , in turn results in larger amount of harvested electric power .",
    "further , the presence of birhythmicity makes a system vulnerable to noise : depending upon the noise intensity the system may end up in any of the two limit cycles , which results in an unpredictable system dynamics @xcite .",
    "therefore , monorhythmicity is of practical importance in most of the physical systems . on the other hand , in networks of neuronal oscillators",
    "the occurrence of birhythmicity is often desirable to generate and maintain different modes of oscillations that organize various biochemical processes in response to variations in their environment @xcite .",
    "therefore , identifying an efficient control technique is of importance that can tame birhythmicity to yield monorhythmic oscillation or can retain its character intact where ever needed .",
    "although several mechanisms are proposed for controlling bistability consisting of oscillation and steady state @xcite ( for an elaborate recent review on the control of multistability see @xcite and references therein ) , only a few exist to control birhythmicity .",
    "@xcite reported an effective control mechanism of birhythmic behavior in a modified van der pol system by using a variant of pyragas technique of time delay control @xcite and they showed that depending upon the time - delay one can induce monorhythmic oscillation out of birhythmicity .",
    "but , due to the presence of time delay the system becomes infinite dimensional and thus a detailed bifurcation analysis for a wide parameter space is difficult and was not reported there .",
    "further , the authors of @xcite established that their technique can _ suppress _ the effective birhythmic zone but can not eliminate it completely for all possible sets of nonlinear damping parameter values . in this context , another interesting control technique has been reported recently by @xcite , where the authors demonstrated that multistable systems with coexisting either periodic or chaotic attractors can be converted into a monostable one by applying an external harmonic modulation and a positive feedback to a proper _ accessible _ system parameter .    in the present paper",
    "we propose an effective and much more general control technique , that we call the conjugate self - feedback control , which is able to eliminate birhythmicity and induce monorhythmic behavior .",
    "we consider a modified van der pol equation that has been proposed to model enzyme reactions in some biosystems @xcite and also has been studied earlier as a prototypical model that exhibits birhthmicity @xcite . with a detailed bifurcation study",
    "we establish the effectiveness of the proposed control technique in taming birhthmicity and inducing monorhythmicity . depending upon the value of the self - feedback strength it also offers freedom to select one of the desired dynamics .",
    "we also demonstrate our results experimentally with an electronic circuit and verify that our results are robust enough in a real - world setup where the presence of parameter fluctuation and noise are inevitable .",
    "first we describe the model used in the following . consider a birhythmic van der pol oscillator given by @xcite @xmath1 here , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are parameters that determine the nonlinear damping .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , kadji _ et al .",
    "_ considered , @xmath5 , and by using the harmonic decomposition method they arrived at the following amplitude equation :    @xmath6    equation is the generic form of the codimension - two saddle - node ( sn ) bifurcation . note that eq .",
    "is independent of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the two parameter bifurcation diagram in the @xmath8 parameter space is shown in fig .",
    "[ ab ] ( a ) that exhibits a cusp type of codimension - two bifurcation .",
    "the exchange of rhythmicity is through the saddle - node bifurcation of the limit cycle ( snlc ) ( shown by the solid black line in the figure ) .",
    "[ ab](b ) shows the controlled case with @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the control parameter to be discussed later ) , where birhythmicity is completely removed and only monorhythmicity exists .",

    "( i.e. , without control ) , snlc : saddle - node bifurcation of limit cycle ; ( b ) with control ( for @xmath9 of eq.[vdpeqcoup ] ) : the control eliminates birhthmicity and only one limit cycle ( lc ) exists . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "next we introduce a conjugate self - feedback term @xmath12 in eq .",
    "@xmath13 which contains the variable of our interest , @xmath14 , and its canonical conjugate @xcite , @xmath15 ; here @xmath10 controls the strength of the self - feedback .",
    "further , a close inspection reveals that the self - feedback mechanism effectively controls the damping of the system through the @xmath15 variable and the effective frequency through the @xmath14 variable .",
    "however , understanding of their collective effect on the dynamics needs a detailed analysis that we will address next .    to unravel the underlying dynamics of the controlled system we use the harmonic decomposition method .",
    "let us assume the approximate solution of be given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the amplitude and @xmath18 the frequency of the oscillator with feedback . substituting this in yields the following expression @xmath19 but according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we can ignore the higher harmonics regarding them as forcing term , which diminish with increasing harmonics .",
    "thus , eq .   can be reduced to @xmath20 the equation suggests the following frequency and amplitude equations , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 it is interesting to note that , eq .   is equivalent to eq .",
    "when @xmath23 , i.e. , in the absence of any feedback .",
    "also , it may be noted that the amplitude of the system depends on @xmath7 when @xmath24 , contrary to eq .  .",
    "the frequency in the harmonic limit corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "further , eq .   imposes an upper limit on the strength of the feedback , namely @xmath26 otherwise the frequency becomes imaginary , which is non - physical .",

    "the amplitude equation eq .   may be solved by graphical method .",
    "the solutions are those for which the function @xmath49 crosses the horizontal zero line .",
    "we consider the parameter set @xmath11 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for which exhibits birhythmicity in the absence of self - feedback ; next , we vary the coupling strength @xmath10 to get different solutions .",
    "the number of limit cycles is determined by the number of solutions of the amplitude equation .",
    "the number provides the information of the steady state solution ( i.e. , no solution ) , existence of a single limit cycle ( monorhythmicity ) or three limit cycles ( birhythmicity , one of the lcs is unstable ) . from fig .",
    "[ ava ] we find that for @xmath34 there is no zero crossing of the curve , i.e. , there is no lc and the system is in a steady state . as we decrease @xmath10 , the @xmath49 curve crosses the horizontal zero line from below and gives rise to a stable lc .",
    "this is shown for @xmath32 with solid gray ( green ) line , here the system has only one stable lc of small amplitude .",
    "further decrease in @xmath10 brings it to the birhythmic regime where the @xmath49 curve crosses the horizontal zero line at three different values of @xmath50 indicating three lcs ( shown for @xmath33 ) .",
    "the stability of three lcs are determined by eq .  , which suggests that the middle zero point of the curve in fig .",
