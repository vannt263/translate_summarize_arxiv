    "last year the selex collaboration reported the first observation of a narrow charmed meson @xmath0 with the mass of @xmath14 mev and decay width @xmath15 mev at @xmath16 confidence level @xcite .",
    "this state has been seen in two decay modes , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with a relative branching ratio @xmath19 .",
    "this relative branching ratio is rather unusual because the phase space of channel @xmath18 is @xmath20 times larger than that of the channel @xmath17 and according to the su(3 ) flavor symmetry the ratio @xmath21 @xcite if the quark content of @xmath0 is @xmath22 , and the reference @xcite gave an estimate of @xmath23 .",
    "since the @xmath0 is above the threshold for @xmath18 and @xmath17 , and its decays to these final states are okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) allowed processes , it is also strange that it has a narrow width ( @xmath11 mev ) .",
    "why this state is so narrow and dominated by the @xmath17 decay mode has inspired a lot of theoretical interest @xcite , with many possible explanations , @xmath24 the first radial excitation of @xmath25 , a tetraquark , a hybrid , a two - meson molecule , a diquark - antidiquark bound state , @xmath26 among them the most plausible candidate is the first radial excitation of @xmath25 , the @xmath27 state , since it is the likely conventional meson with component of @xmath28 which has not been found . and",
    "even though the mass of @xmath29 mev is about @xmath30 mev below the traditional potential model prediction ( for example , see @xcite ) , the similar situation has been found in the new narrow charm - strange @xmath31 meson @xmath32 , favored as the conventional @xmath33 state .",
    "furthermore , simonov and tjon @xcite showed a possible mechanism to shift down the meson mass by the coupled - channel analysis method .",
    "chao @xcite gave a reasonable argument that the node structure in the @xmath27 state may explain the small decay width and unusual decay modes .",
    "in this letter , following the references @xcite , we assume @xmath0 as the first radial excitation of vector meson @xmath34",
    ". then we solve the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation @xcite , and give our prediction of mass for @xmath35 state . at the same time",
    ", we obtain the wave functions of the relevant mesons . by using the reduction formula , pcac relation and low energy theorem",
    ", we write the transition @xmath36-matrix as a formula involving the light meson decay constant and the corresponding axial current transition matrix element between two heavy mesons , which in turn can be written as an overlapping integral of the relevant wave functions .",
    "we give a detailed consideration on the node structure in @xmath37 wave function .",
    "we further try to make a rough estimate on the full decay width and the ratio @xmath38 by assuming @xmath0 as the @xmath39-wave @xmath1 vector state as well as considering the possible @xmath13 wave mixing .",
    "in our previous papers @xcite , we solved exactly the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equations ( or the salpeter equations @xcite ) to describe the behavior of @xmath40 and @xmath1 states . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have given the mass spectra and wave functions of pseudoscalar @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and the mass spectra of all these heavy @xmath40 states , which are consistent with experimental data quite well .",
    "for the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation of @xmath1 states @xcite , we have used the same parameters as used in @xcite , only changing the parameter @xmath44 to fit data because @xmath44 is the only parameter which can be different for @xmath40 and @xmath1 states when their quark contents are the same . in this letter",
    "we first solve the full salpeter @xmath1 equation through fitting the ground state mass at @xmath45 mev ( @xmath2 ) to fix the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "after fixing the parameter @xmath44 , we then give the predictions of the first radial excitation state .",
    "since we are only interested in the leading order estimate , which lets us see the problem clearly , we assume in our calculation that the first radial excitation state @xmath46 is a pure @xmath36 wave state , excluding the possible mixing between @xmath36 wave and @xmath39 wave states . later in this letter",
    "we will also consider the @xmath39 wave contribution .",
    "our prediction for the mass of the first radial excitation state is @xmath47 mev , which is about @xmath4 mev heavier than the experimental data @xmath5 mev .",
    "in this section we give a detailed description for the calculation of the transition matrix element . by using the reduction formula ,",
    "the transition @xmath36-matrix of decay @xmath48 ( similar to the channel @xmath49 ) can be written as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the total momenta of initial state @xmath54 , final state heavy",
    "meson and final state light meson , respectively ( see figure 1 ) ; @xmath55 is the mass of the final light meson .",
    "the pcac relates the meson field @xmath56 with a current @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the decay constant of light meson ; @xmath59 is @xmath60 for @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "then the @xmath36-matrix becomes @xmath64 @xmath65 and with the low energy theorem this equation can be written approximately as : @xmath66    ( 100,170)(300,435 ) ( 0,0 )    for the decay @xmath67 , the equation is similar , but there is @xmath68 mixing . including the @xmath68 mixing",
    ", the pcac relation reads as @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the decay constants of octet @xmath74 and singlet @xmath75 , respectively",
    ". then the transition matrix element becomes @xmath76 @xmath77 \\langle d_s(p_{f1})|\\bar{s}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_{5}s|d^{+}_{sj}(p_i)\\rangle .",
    "\\label{pcac2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the decays @xmath78 are ozi - rule - allowed , so we may ignore anomaly of the pcac safely in eqs .",
    "( [ pcac1],[pcac2 ] ) .    according to the mandelstam formalism @xcite , at the leading order",
    ", the matrix element @xmath79 can be written as @xcite : @xmath80,\\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the mass of @xmath83 and @xmath59 ( @xmath84 ) quark ; @xmath85 is the recoil three dimensional momentum of the final state @xmath39 meson .",
    "@xmath86 , @xmath87 are the momenta of @xmath83 and @xmath88 quark in the initial meson , respectively . and",
    "the relative momentum @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 , in the center of mass system of the initial meson , and it becomes @xmath91 ; @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are called the positive energy wave function of the initial and final heavy mesons , and @xmath94 .",
    "the positive energy wave function of @xmath42 can be found in paper @xcite : @xmath95@xmath96\\gamma_{_5}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 and @xmath98 ; @xmath99 , @xmath100 are the radial part wave functions , and their numerical values can be obtained by solving the full salpter equation of @xmath40 state .    since the wave function @xmath101 directly relates to the first radially excited state , there is only one node in it .",
    "we note that the node structure can possibly play an important role to explain both the narrow decay width and the dominance of @xmath17 decay mode , to a certain degree .",
    "the value of the radial wave function of @xmath54 state becomes negative as a function of relative momentum @xmath89 when it crosses the node ( denoted as @xmath102 ) , that is when @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , this negative part of the wave function tends to cancel the contribution to the decay width from the positive part of the same wave function , which can be the reason to have a small decay width . in the overlapping integral of the wave functions eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) there is the shift of momentum , @xmath104 , and this will even strengthen the negative contribution because the shift will move the peak of the radial wave function of the final @xmath39 meson close to the node .",
    "we note that the value of the overlapping integral will be significantly affected by the momentum shift as the larger momentum shift will cause the larger negative contribution , and in turn the smaller overlapping integral ( smaller decay width ) . since the recoil momentum @xmath105 of @xmath39 meson is larger than that of @xmath41 , about @xmath106 times , and the momentum shift in case of @xmath107 is @xmath108 times larger than that of the @xmath109 channel , larger negative contribution results in @xmath107 channel than in the @xmath109 channel , which can be the very reason for the small ratio of the branching ratios @xmath110 .    as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , there may be the @xmath13 mixing in @xmath1 state @xcite , so we will try to estimate the possible mixing contributions here too .",
    "we first assume that this @xmath1 state is a pure @xmath36 wave state @xmath111 , and later we will consider the case of @xmath39 wave state . the wave function of @xmath1 can be written as @xcite : @xmath112\\frac{(\\omega_{c}\\omega_{q}+{\\vec q}^2-m_{c}m_{q } ) } { ( m_c+m_q){\\vec q}^2 } \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath113 \\frac{(m_{q}\\omega_{c}-m_{c}\\omega_{q})}{(\\omega_{c } + \\omega_{q}){\\vec{q}}^2 } \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the positive energy wave function is defined as : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the polarization vector of a @xmath116 state ; @xmath117 , @xmath118 are the energy projection operators for quark and antiquark ; the numerical value of the radial part wave function @xmath119 , @xmath120 will be obtained by solving the exact salpter equation of @xmath1 state .",
    "for our numerical calculations we use the following parameters : @xmath121 mev , @xmath122 mev , @xmath123 mev , @xmath124 mev @xcite , @xmath125 mev @xmath126 mev , @xmath127 mev @xcite and @xmath128 mev @xcite .",
    "the mass of octet @xmath74 can be estimated by the gell - mann - okubo relation @xmath129 , the mass of singlet @xmath75 can be obtained by @xmath130 , and the mixing angle can be estimated by the relation @xmath131 .",
    "[ so our input values are @xmath132 mev , @xmath133 mev , @xmath134 . ]",
    "we estimate the mass of the first radial excitation of @xmath2 by solving the full salpeter equation of @xmath1 state , and our prediction is @xmath47 mev , which is @xmath4 mev heavier than the central value @xmath5 mev measured by selex .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are estimated by varying all the input parameters simultaneously within @xmath135 , and we choose the largest possible error .",
    "we obtained the wave functions of the corresponding states , and we show radial part wave functions @xmath136 , @xmath137 of @xmath41 in figure 2 ; @xmath136 , @xmath137 of @xmath42 in figure 3 ; @xmath138 , @xmath139 of @xmath111 in figure 4 .",
    "we show the overlapping part of @xmath111 wave function @xmath140 and @xmath41 wave function @xmath141 , when it has the biggest momentum shift @xmath142 in figure 5 .",
    "we also show @xmath140 and @xmath42 wave function @xmath143 in figure 6 .",
    "one can see that in @xmath111 wave function the node localizes at @xmath144 mev , and the biggest momentum shifts are @xmath145 mev for @xmath42 , and @xmath146 mev for @xmath147 .",
    "the decay width for the two body final state can be written as : @xmath148 here the matrix element @xmath149 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 is @xmath150 and for @xmath151 it is @xmath152 \\langle d(p_{f1})|\\bar{q}\\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_{5}s|d^{+}_{sj}(p_i)\\rangle .\\ ] ] we obtain the following decay widths : @xmath153 @xmath154 @xmath155 and the corresponding ratios are @xmath156 as can be seen , we can not find the dominance of @xmath157 , and the ratio is much different from the experimental ratio @xmath9 .",
    "the sum of those three decay widths is @xmath10 mev , already larger than the observed bound for full width ( @xmath11 mev ) given by selex experiment .",
    "therefore , our assumption of the pure @xmath36 wave vector state can not fit the experimental data .                before considering the @xmath13 mixing in @xmath164 vector state ,",
    "let us first assume @xmath0 to be a pure @xmath39 wave state . in this case , we do not solve the full salpeter equation , but instead , we give the leading order estimate for the pure @xmath39 wave explanation . the wave function of a pure @xmath39 wave state ( @xmath165 coupling ) can be simplified as : @xmath166 where @xmath167 . with this wave function as input and by using the same parameters as for the @xmath36 wave state",
    ", we can solve the approximate salpeter equation , @xmath168 , only the positive energy part solution is considered .",
    "the mass of this pure @xmath39 wave state is @xmath169 mev , and the radial wave function of this pure @xmath39 wave state is shown in figure 7 .                to estimate the matrix element in this case",
    ", we calculate the overlapping integral of initial and final wave functions .",
    "there is only one term , which can give a non - zero contribution : @xmath173 where @xmath174 ; @xmath83 is a constant ; @xmath175 is a shorthand notation for the terms which are functions of @xmath176 ; @xmath177 is the polarization tensor , which couples with the polarization vector @xmath178 to make the total polarization vector @xmath179 : @xmath180 @xmath181\\ , . \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( l=2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then",
    ", we obtain the numerical values for the decay widths when @xmath182 is a pure @xmath39 wave state ( @xmath183 ) : @xmath184 @xmath185 @xmath186 and the corresponding ratios are @xmath187 which show that the pure @xmath39 wave assumption does not fit the experimental data obviously .",
    "we now consider the possibility of the @xmath13 mixing with a mixing angle @xmath192 : @xmath193 and @xmath194 as a function of the mixing angle @xmath192 in figure [ mixing ] .",
    "numerically it is easy to find that when the mixing angle is taken to be @xmath195 , the relative branching ratio @xmath196 can fit the selex data .",
    "we also predict other relative branching ratios @xmath197 with a rather small total decay width @xmath198 which is quite smaller than the experimental bound for the full width ( @xmath11 mev ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in fact there is another solution for the mixing angle , @xmath199 , which can also fit the data of the relative branching ratio .",
    "for this solution , accordingly , the relative branching ratios @xmath200 and @xmath201 are predicted with a slightly larger total decay width @xmath202 mev .",
    "the two solutions present a different relative aspect on the two decay channels @xmath203 and @xmath49 .    as a final note , we only estimated the ozi allowed strong decay widths @xmath204 and @xmath205 assuming that @xmath206 is an @xmath1 vector state . however , there are some other mechanisms through which the @xmath1 vector state can decay to the same final states , which we do not consider here . for example",
    ", there is the ozi forbidden mechanism for @xmath206 decaying to @xmath207 through the anomaly term in pcac , @xmath168 it can decay through two gluons , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , which is a decay similar to @xmath210 ( with decay width about @xmath211 kev ) .",
    "as is well known , the ozi forbidden processes are small and can not improve sufficiently the relative ratio to agree with the selex data .",
    "therefore , we do not include the processes in our analysis .",
    "as summary , according to the data from selex and our estimates made here , it is not likely that the @xmath182 is the pure @xmath36-wave @xmath1 vector state .",
    "only the @xmath13 wave mixing assumption may explain the relative branching ratio @xmath212 , whereas the assumption seems to give a rather small total decay width ( to be compared with the experimental bound @xmath213 mev ) . generally speaking , our results ( based on pcac and low energy theorem ) are qualitatively similar to those of ref.@xcite ( based on @xmath214 model ) .",
    "we find that the node structure for the first radially excited state of the @xmath1 ground state @xmath2 can have a favorable effect on the relative ratio of the decay widths but it can not be so big as indicated by the data .",
    "the @xmath13 wave mixing may help to explain the data , however , more precise measurements on the relative ratio @xmath215 ( and/or @xmath216 ) as well as the total decay width are crucial .",
    "therefore , the explanation of @xmath0 as the first radially excited state of the @xmath1 ground state @xmath2 is too early to conclude . +",
