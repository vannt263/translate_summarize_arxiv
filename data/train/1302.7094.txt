    "concept inventories are used to assess learning in many areas of physics education @xcite . when used to determine the effectiveness of educational innovations they may contribute to the teaching development cycle . since the literature on special relativity education research does not include a concept inventory we have developed the relativity concept inventory ( rci ) , available from the supplemental appendix to this paper .",
    "special relativity is interesting in a physics education research context because of its combination of deeply challenging concepts and simple mathematics .",
    "this is in contrast with quantum mechanics , which has a more complex mathematical structure . nevertheless , the amount of physics education research on special relativity is small @xcite .",
    "the rci has been validated by feedback from discipline experts and its validity and reliability established by standard methods @xcite .",
    "these include the self - referential statistics of classical test theory , and benchmarking against traditional assessment such as homework and an exam .",
    "we have also developed and applied monte carlo simulation techniques suitable for the analysis of correlations in data with small sample size .    in the next section",
    "we describe the process used to develop the rci . in section [ the students ]",
    "we characterize the students the rci was administered to . in section [ data analysis methods ] we describe the methods used to analyse the collected data , including the use of : item response theory to control for the effect of student ability on correlations between questions , and monte carlo modeling to estimate the statistical significance of correlations . in section [ results ]",
    "we present misconceptions diagnosed by the rci and evidence for its gender bias .",
    "finally , in the conclusions , we suggest revisions of the rci . we also argue that understanding the gender bias in concept inventories is a significant problem for physics education research .",
    "the development of the rci followed adams and wieman @xcite insofar as our six month project schedule allowed .",
    "in particular , student interviews were not relied on as much as suggested by them . the only previous attempt to develop a concept inventory for special relativity",
    "is reported in gibson s doctoral thesis @xcite .",
    "we first formulated a list of concepts that captured the learning goals of the introductory relativity instruction in the physics 2 course at the the australian national university ( anu ) .",
    "these concepts were also informed by relevant textbooks @xcite and the physics education research literature .",
    "expert feedback on each of fourteen draft concepts of introductory relativity was obtained from thirty international respondents @xcite using an online survey .",
    "agreement with the the appropriateness of the concepts in our list ranged from 100% for the first postulate to 50% . after individual consideration ,",
    "concepts with agreement below 75% were dropped from the list .",
    "the final list of nine concepts is given in table [ concepts ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "classical test theory suggests that the rci may be too easy and , perhaps consequently , insufficiently discriminating .",
    "however , we do not recommend revisions , other than those suggested below , until data from a wider range of students has been analysed .",
    "in section [ item response theory ] we concluded that question 24 , concerning the concept of mass - energy equivalence , should be dropped from the rci .",
    "it has zero discrimination , and is the only question having a negative normalised gain between the pre and post - tests .",
    "it was also found to have a strong negative correlation with an apparently unrelated question .",
    "if dropped , the concept of mass - energy equivalence would not be tested by the rci .",
    "in section [ misconceptions ] we concluded that a frame symmetrical pair of length contraction questions is desirable , mirroring the symmetrical pair of time dilation questions .",
    "hence we recommend that a partner question be added to the existing rci length contraction question 13 .",
    "however , any such question would require validation along the lines described in sections [ the development process ] and [ data analysis methods ] .",
    "the evidence presented in section [ gender differences ] suggests that the rci is gender biased .",
    "previous work has shown similar biases in the force concept inventory and in other concept inventories .",
    "concept inventories are useful because they can help evaluate innovation and hence improve teaching .",
    "however if their evaluations are biased with respect to certain student groups there is a risk that improved learning for some comes at the expense of the learning of others .",
    "it is a task for future physics education research to investigate and understand this interesting and important problem .",
    "the authors would like to thank the academics and students who helped develop the rci .",
    "we would especially like to acknowledge a.  wilson for her help with the student interviews , and p.  francis for his advice on statistical analysis .",
