    "power density spectra of the x - ray brightness of lmxbs reveal various types of qpos .",
    "some two dozen of the 187 known lmxbs @xcite have been observed to produce simultaneously two qpos with frequencies @xmath3 hz that increase and decrease together by hundreds of hz @xcite . some of the key observational features of these khz qpos and their connection to our current theoretical understanding can be summarized as follows @xcite :    1 .",
    "the frequency of one of the two khz qpos probably reflects the azimuthal frequency of gas in a streamline at a particular radius in the inner disk .",
    "the frequencies of the khz qpos are similar to orbital frequencies near a neutron star and vary by hundreds of hertz on time scales as short as minutes . such large , rapid variations are possible if the frequency is related to the orbital frequency at a radius that varies .",
    "this can be used to constrain the equation of state of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "2 .   the star s spin appears to be involved in producing the frequency separation @xmath0 of the two kilohertz qpos in a pair .",
    "this is evident in the millisecond pulsars ( msps ) xte  j1807@xmath4294 , where @xmath5 @xcite , and sax  j1808.4@xmath43658 , where @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is strongly indicated in the other kilohertz qpo sources , because in all cases where both @xmath0 and @xmath7 have been measured , the largest value of @xmath0 is consistent or approximately consistent with either @xmath7 or @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus , if paired khz qpos are detected but accretion- and nuclear - powered x - ray oscillations are not , a rough estimate of the star s spin rate can be made using @xmath0 .",
    "the spin rate may be communicated directly by the star s magnetic field or indirectly , e.g. , via an anisotropic radiation pattern that rotates with the star . in eihter case",
    "the star s magnetic field must be dynamically important .",
    "4 .   in order to explain the oscillation amplitudes observed , the x - rays must be coming from the surface of the neutron star , because the energy available at larger radii is far too small . a viable model should explain ( a ) what determines the frequency ( radius ) at which the principal qpo is generated ; ( b ) why the width of a khz qpo peak ( range of orbital radii ) is so small ; ( c ) how the frequency of the principal qpo changes by factors @xmath9 ; and ( d ) how the spin frequency of the neutron star is involved .",
    "so far , the only model that may explain these key features of the khz qpos and their amplitudes , energy - dependence , and dependence on the mass accretion rate is the sonic - point spin - resonance model @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a khz qpo pair in 11 archived rxte observations of cir x-1 and a single khz qpo in 69 other observations .",
    "figure [ twins ] shows results from one of these observations .",
    "the two khz qpos are visible at 136@xmath105 hz and 404@xmath102 hz .",
    "their frequencies track one another and the frequency of the low - frequency qpo in the same way as in other ns lmxbs ( see fig .  [ pbk ] ) .",
    "this , and the fact that the frequencies and frequency ratio of the khz qpos vary greatly from one observation to another demonstrates that the cir x-1 system :    1 .   contains a ns , resolving a debate that had continued for more than two decades 2 .",
    "has a dynamically important magnetic field , as inferred from the current understanding of how the khz qpos are generated , and 3 .",
    "has a spin frequency of several hundred hz , based on the frequency separation of the khz qpo pair .",
    "table [ spins ] shows the inferred spin rates of exo  0748@xmath4676 and the 23 known accreting millisecond pulsars . nuclear- and",
    "accretion - powered oscillations have been detected in 17 and 10 of them , respectively ; khz qpos have been detected in 11 msps .",

    "the discovery of paired khz qpos in cir x-1 has answered several important questions , but has also opened new ones :    * the frequencies of the paired khz qpos seen in cir x-1 reach the lowest values so far observed in ns lmxbs : 55 hz for the lower qpo and 250 hz for the upper qpo .",
    "these observed frequencies extend the previously known frequency correlation ( @xcite , fig .",
    "[ pbk ] ) over a range of a factor 4 ; single khz qpos were seen with frequencies as low as 10 hz . according to the current theoretical understanding [ sec:1 ] ( see above )",
    ", this implies that the frequency of the principal khz qpo is sometimes generated at a radius @xmath1250 km , for a 2 m@xmath13 star . *",
    "the frequency separation @xmath0 of the khz qpos reaches the lowest value so far observed ( 170 hz ) , and @xmath14 is @xmath15 , larger than the values @xmath16 observed in other khz qpo systems . *",
