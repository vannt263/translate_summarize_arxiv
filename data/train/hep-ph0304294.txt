    "asymptotic freedom suggests that at sufficiently high temperature and/or quark chemical potential qcd is deconfined , i.e. can be described in terms of the fundamental quark and gluonic degrees of freedom @xcite . high temperature and small chemical potential are of relevance to the quest for the quark - gluon plasma in heavy - ion experiments",
    "; sufficiently high chemical potential ( at comparatively low temperature ) may be reached in the cores of compact stars . in the latter case",
    ", novel color superconducting phases may occur @xcite , which should however have only comparatively small effects on the equation of state .",
    "the thermodynamic pressure of qcd at high temperature @xmath0 has been determined in perturbation theory to order @xmath1 in qcd and even to @xmath2 in a recent heroic effort @xcite .",
    "strict perturbation theory , however , shows extremely poor convergence for any temperature of practical interest so that further resummations appear to be necessary . in recent years",
    ", resummations which are based on the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) effective action have been proposed , alternatively in form of so - called htl perturbation theory or based upon the 2-loop @xmath3-derivable approximation ( see also peshier @xcite ) .",
    "the latter approach , which assumes weakly interacting quasiparticles as determined by the htl propagators and nlo corrections thereof , leads to results which agree remarkably well with lattice data down to about @xmath4 if standard 2-loop running @xmath5 is adopted , and it has been recently shown that these results are in fact consistent with those obtained in high - order perturbation theory if the latter is organized through effective ( dimensionally reduced ) field theory according to @xcite and effective - field - theory parameters are kept without further expanding in powers of the coupling @xcite , as already advocated in ref .  @xcite .    the behavior of the thermodynamic potentials closer to the transition temperature needs to be studied by fully non - perturbative means . for zero quark",
    "chemical potential @xmath6 lattice qcd calculations are seemingly up to the task of determining thermodynamic quantities for a quark - gluon plasma very accurately by now @xcite .",
    "although recently there has been important progress also for non - vanishing @xmath7 @xcite , the case of large @xmath8 ( relevant for the equation of state for cold dense matter , which is of importance in astrophysical situations ) is currently beyond the reach of lattice calculations .    as a remedy for this situation , peshier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a method which can be used to map the available lattice data for @xmath6 to finite @xmath7 and small temperatures by describing the interacting plasma as a system of massive quasiparticles ( qps ) ; section 2 gives a short review of this technique .",
    "while in their simple qp model the ( thermal ) masses of the quarks and gluons are approximated by the asymptotic limit of the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) self - energies , we consider models based on the htl - resummed entropy @xcite , which include more of the physically important plasmon effect than in the simple qp model , and ( nlo ) extensions thereof , which include the full plasmon effect . in perturbation theory it is essentially this effect that spoils convergence , so a priori it was not granted that a model including this effect fully would give physically sensible results . as it turns out , however , the results based on our models ( which are presented in section 3 and 4 , respectively ) turn out to be well - behaved and indeed lie not too far from the simple qp model .    in section 5",
    "we give the 2-parameter fits of the various models to the lattice data @xcite for 2 flavors and compare the model results for the pressure at small temperatures and large chemical potential in section 6 .",
    "furthermore , we compare our results for the isobar emerging at is always to be understood as @xmath9 . ]",
    "@xmath10 to recent lattice results and give our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "assuming an su(@xmath11 ) plasma of gluons and @xmath12 light quarks in thermodynamic equilibrium can be described as a weakly interacting gas of massive quasiparticles with residual interaction @xmath13 , the pressure of the system is given by @xcite @xmath14 where the sum runs over gluons ( g ) , quarks and anti - quarks ( q ) with respective chemical potential @xmath15 ; @xmath16 are the model dependent qp pressures and @xmath17 are the qp masses . the latter are functions of an effective strong coupling @xmath18 , which appears only within @xmath19 in a predefined form .    using the stationarity of the thermodynamic potential under variation of the self - energies and maxwell s relations @xcite , one obtains a partial differential equation for @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are coefficients that are given by integrals depending on @xmath25 and @xmath20 . given a valid boundary condition , a solution for @xmath18 is found by solving the above flow equation by the method of characteristics ; once @xmath20 is thus known in the @xmath25 plane , the qp pressure is fixed completely . the residual interaction @xmath13",
    "is then given by the integral @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integration constant that has to be fixed by lattice data ( usually by requiring @xmath28 ) .",
    "motivated by the fact that at @xmath6 and @xmath29 the coupling should behave as predicted by the perturbative qcd beta - function , ref .",
    "@xcite used the ansatz @xmath30 the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 are determined by fitting the entropy of the model ( which is independent of @xmath13 ) to available lattice data at @xmath6 . using ( [ g2ansatz ] ) as boundary condition for ( [ andrefloweq ] ) , the above procedure allows one to map the lattice pressure from @xmath6 to the whole @xmath25-plane .",
    "a simple ansatz for the qp pressure is obtained by taking @xmath16 to be the pressure of a free gas of massive particles @xcite , with the masses defined as the asymptotic ( i.e. large momentum ) gluonic and fermionic self - energies , respectively @xcite : @xmath33    comparing with perturbation theory one finds that while the stefan - boltzmann and leading - order interaction terms are correctly reproduced , only @xmath34 of the nlo term of the interaction pressure ( the plasmon effect @xmath35 ) is present @xcite .    to include more of this physically relevant effect , one can make use of the htl - resummed entropy @xcite , which takes into account the momentum dependence of the qp excitations as well as landau - damping effects .",
    "the htl model ansatz for the qp pressure for gluons ( @xmath36 ) and quarks @xmath37 then reads @xmath38 \\label{pg } \\\\ p_q & = & - d_{q } \\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\int_{0}^{\\infty } % \\frac{d \\omega}{2 \\pi } \\left(f_{+}(\\omega)+f_{-}(\\omega)\\right)% \\left[\\rm{im}\\ln{\\left(k-\\omega+\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}\\right ) } \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.-\\rm{im}\\hat{\\sigma}_{+}\\rm{re}\\hat{\\delta}_{+}% + \\rm{im}\\ln{\\left(k+\\omega+\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}\\right)}+% \\rm{im}\\hat{\\sigma}_{-}% \\rm{re}\\hat{\\delta}_{-}\\right ] , \\label{pq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 for gluons and quarks / anti - quarks , respectively ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the bosonic and fermionic distribution functions .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 are the htl propagators with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the corresponding self - energies , @xmath47   \\label{pil}\\\\ \\hat{\\pi}_{t}(\\omega , k ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\hat{m}_{d}^2+% \\frac{\\omega^2-k^2}{k^2}% \\hat{\\pi_{l}}\\right ] \\label{pit}\\\\ \\hat{\\sigma}_{\\pm } & = & \\frac{\\hat{m}^2}{k}\\left[1-\\frac{\\omega\\mp k}{2k}% \\ln{\\frac{\\omega+k}{\\omega - k}}\\right ] ; \\label{sig}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we have written in terms of the htl debye mass squared @xmath48 and the htl zero - momentum quark mass squared @xmath49 .",
    "the htl qp model includes @xmath50 of the full plasmon effect at @xmath6 , which is a factor of @xmath51 more than in the simple qp model which only uses the asymptotic htl masses .",
    "the remainder of the plasmon effect is in fact entirely due to nlo corrections to these asymptotic masses at order @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the complete ( momentum - dependent ) nlo corrections to the asymptotic masses of quarks and gluons have not been calculated yet , but as far as the plasmon effect is concerned , these corrections contribute in the averaged form @xcite @xmath53 and similarly @xmath54    for the values of the coupling @xmath55 considered here , these corrections are so large that they give tachyonic masses when treated strictly perturbatively . in ref .  @xcite it has been proposed to incorporate these corrections through a quadratic gap equation which works well as an approximation in the exactly solvable scalar o(@xmath56)-model , where strict perturbation theory would lead to identical difficulties .",
    "however , for the fermionic asymptotic masses , in order to have the correct scaling of casimir factors in the exactly solvable large-@xmath57 limit of qcd , a corresponding gap equation has to remain linear in the fermionic mass squared . choosing the correction therein to be determined by the solution to the gluonic gap leads to @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the leading - order gluonic and fermionic asymptotic masses as given in ( [ minfty2 ] ) and ( [ minfty2 ] ) .",
    "this in fact avoids tachyonic masses for the fermions as long as @xmath61 .",
    "the solutions to the above approximate gap equations happen to coincide with those obtained in the original version of two independent quadratic gap equations of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the case @xmath62 considered in this paper ,",
    "the differences are fairly small . for @xmath63 , however , the necessity to avoid tachyonic masses would restrict the range of permissible coupling strength @xmath55 . ]    finally , since the averaged quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the effective masses at hard momenta only , a cutoff scale @xmath66 is introduced that separates soft from hard momenta .",
    "the qp pressure for this model , which in the following will be referred to as nla - model , then separates into a soft and a hard component for both gluons and fermions .",
    "the soft parts are given by expressions like ( [ pg ] ) and ( [ pq ] ) , but with @xmath67 as upper limit for the momentum integration .",
    "for the hard parts , the momentum integrations run from @xmath67 to @xmath68 and the mass pre - factors in the htl self - energies ( [ pil],[pit],[sig ] ) are replaced by their asymptotic counterparts , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the single free parameter @xmath71 in @xmath67 can be varied around @xmath72 to obtain an idea of the `` theoretical error '' of the model . in the following",
    "we will consider the range @xmath73 to @xmath74 ; note that @xmath75 corresponds to the htl - model ( which has been used as cross - check ) since all hard corrections are ignored . on the other hand , @xmath76 would assume that ( [ minftyb2 ] ) and ( [ minftyb2 ] ) represent good approximations for the nlo corrections to the spectral properties of soft excitations .",
    "however , the few existing results , in particular on nlo corrections to the debye mass and the plasma frequency @xcite , appear to be rather different so that it seems safer to leave the soft sector unchanged by keeping a finite @xmath77 .",
    "to obtain the input parameters @xmath32 and @xmath31 we fitted the entropy expressions from the models under consideration to lattice data @xcite for @xmath78 , with an estimated continuum extrapolation as used in ref .",
    "we find +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    a value of @xmath79 for @xmath78 has also been found in the simple quasiparticle model in @xcite and thus seems to be model independent , in contrast to the bag constant @xmath80 , which varies between @xmath81 and @xmath82 mev . by using the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equations and the equation of state one can determine the mass - radius relations of non - rotating quark - stars @xcite ; choosing @xmath83 and taking the bag constant values from above , we find stable star configurations with radii ranging from @xmath84 to @xmath85 km and masses from @xmath86-@xmath87 solar masses for nla , @xmath88 and htl models , respectively .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the outermost layers of such a quark star are metastable with respect to hadronic matter and therefore the details of the star structure will depend sensitively on the hadronic equation of state @xcite .     to @xmath50 ( dark band ) and",
    "perturbative 2-loop running coupling ( light gray band ) . ]",

    "we considered an improvement of simple quasiparticle models @xcite by using the full htl approximation and certain nlo corrections thereof along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite and investigated the respective predictions at finite chemical potential when these models are matched to @xmath78 lattice data at @xmath6 .",
    "we found that the slope of constant pressure for those models with @xmath90 agrees very well with recent lattice data for 2 + 1 flavors @xcite , while the lattice data for @xmath62 @xcite indicate significantly steeper slopes .",
    "we also found that for our models the pressure for non - vanishing @xmath7 scales with the quark number susceptibilities at @xmath6 , provided that the @xmath91 terms ( corresponding to a higher order susceptibility ) are not dropped but added with the same weight as in the ideal gas limit .",
    "we therefore interpreted the `` scaling curve '' from 2 + 1 flavor lattice data @xcite as susceptibilities at @xmath6 and found that a comparison with @xmath78 susceptibilities from another lattice group @xcite as well as those obtained from our models all agree very well .",
    "we finally extended our results to the small temperature , high density regime and obtained an estimate for the critical density at @xmath92 which is consistent with earlier results , though in excess of the expectations of ref .",
    "furthermore , we obtained an equation of state for cold , dense matter , which allows for pure quarks stars with masses of @xmath93 and radii of less than @xmath94 km , similar to the results obtained by @xcite .",
