    "dark state or coherent population trapping ( cpt ) , which is null eigenvalue state of the interaction hamiltonian , has given rise to growing interests for past few decades , since its first discovery in 1976  @xcite . if a three - level @xmath0 atomic system is coherently trapped in dark states , there is no absorption of incident laser fields even in the presence of resonant transitions , due to destructive quantum interference between two transition pathways .",
    "well - known dark state or cpt  @xcite involves extensive applications in many fields such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , lasing without inversion  @xcite , the enhancement of the refractive index  @xcite , adiabatic population transfer  @xcite , subrecoil laser cooling  @xcite , and atom interferometry  @xcite .",
    "coherent population transfer using stimulated raman adiabatic passage(stirap ) technique  @xcite , make it robust and efficient to prepare atoms and molecules in a well defined required state in many fields such as spectroscopy , collision dynamics , and atomic physics .",
    "the stokes and pump laser fields in a kind of counterintuitive order under two - photon resonance and adiabatic evolution carry out complete coherent population transfer , and the stirap technique is insensitive to variations of laser pulse shape , intensity , and laser frequency .",
    "it is also of crucial importance that a required coherent superposition state is prepared for atoms and molecules .",
    "fractional stirap technique  @xcite , where the stokes laser arrives before the pump laser and both terminate simultaneously maintaining a constant ratio of relative amplitudes , can create an arbitrary required coherent superposition state .",
    "the technique is also insensitive to pulse delay , intensity and frequency of laser fields .",
    "another adiabatic transfer  @xcite using a tripod linkage by three laser fields in a four - level system can also to obtain good result .    here",
    "we propose an automated method for adiabatic population transfer and the preparation of an arbitrary quantum superposition state in a three - level @xmath0 configuration atomic system , using the oscillating dark states ( ods ) , where probability amplitudes of the system state oscillate periodically between two ground levels .",
    "the state to be prepared can be retrieved at a predictable time , and this method is insensitive to the initial state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains the discussion of the oscillating dark states ( ods ) and evolving adiabatic conditions , under which the system follows the stable ods evolution . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the master equation for a practical incoherent atomic system , and simulate the ods evolution , which then be used for adiabatic population transfer and the preparation of an arbitrary quantum superposition state .",
    "we give some discussion and summarize our conclusions in sec .",

    "if a system is in state @xmath57 , there is no possibility of excitation to @xmath3 and subsequent spontaneous emission , thus the atom is effectively decoupled from laser fields .",

    "a process for adiabatic population transfer and quantum state preparation is as follows : first , the initial instantaneous eigenstate of the whole system , which is determined by chosen interaction hamiltonian , must be the atomic initial state , and here we assume that the atomic initial state is @xmath1 .",

    "when we upload / unload two pairs of laser fields , uploading / unloading adiabatic conditions are necessary besides evolving adiabatic conditions  ( [ eq : evolving adiabatic conditions ] ) , in order to keep the least diabatic coupling between bright states and dark states of the system .",

    "the value of rabi frequencies @xmath62 of laser fields increased little by little , it can be seen that coherent reconstruction mechanism of laser fields becomes superior gradually to the decoherence effect of the system in case ( c ) and ( b ) , and entirely dominates periodical oscillation of the system in case ( a ) . a complete population transfer between two lower ground levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the preparation of an arbitrary quantum superposition state in an automatical manner , using a coherent evolution process of the ods in case ( a ) , is reliable .",
    "here upper level @xmath3 population is much little and the oscillation of probability amplitudes of two ground levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 is periodical , since the decoherence between two ground levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be greatly suppressed , owing to coherent reconstruction contribution from laser fields .",
