    "one simple example is considered in appendix [ sec_he ] .    in the end of this section",
    "we can say that asymptotic behaviour of the inner orbitals is changed by the entanglement induced by the ( anti ) symmetrization postulate .",

    "the observable does not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the measurement of @xmath74 requires significant energy . in order to detect an electron at a particular distance @xmath67",

    "the energy we need to detect position of the bound electron is @xmath77 .",
    "we see that the measurement of the observable @xmath74 changes the energy of the system .",
    "this is different from the observations in the scattering theory where we detect particles at infinity .",
    "such measurements can be done with arbitrary small momentum and energy transfer . because of that in the scattering theory the energy of the system is conserved .",
    "these examples suggest that when during the measurement the energy of the system is conserved the exponent of the asymptote is given by the energies of the initial and the final state . on the contrary , when the measurement requires energy ,",
    "the asymptote can be described by many exponents .",
    "it seems that asymptotics and are so different that it should be easy to prove experimentally which of them is correct .",
    "however these expressions coincide for the outermost electron shell , which gives dominant contribution to any physical processes at large distances .",
    "the inner shell asymptotic amplitudes are strongly suppressed .",
    "though predictions for the inner shell contribution to such processes from eqs",
    ".   and can differ by many orders of magnitude , they still can be too small to be experimentally observable .",
    "recently @xcite argued that asymptotics ( [ eq_gen ] ) should lead to an observable field ionization ( fi ) from the inner shells in the strong electric field @xmath78 .",
    "he estimated that the inner shell contribution scales as @xmath79 and for the field @xmath80 v / cm it can be on the order of @xmath81 .",
    "unfortunately such static fields are not achievable .",
    "if we use the low frequency laser field instead of the dc field , it will be hardly possible to disentangle tunneling fi from the multi photon processes .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that fi from the inner shells can be detected even for the asymptotics given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_gen ] ) .",
    "here we want to draw attention to the positron annihilation on the inner electron shells @xcite as a potential test of the expression ( [ eq_fact5a ] ) . in the non - relativistic approximation",
    "the annihilation vertex is proportional to the @xmath82-function .",
    "thus , if we can control the final state of the ion , the annihilation cross section can be approximately linked to the observable @xmath83 defined by eq .",
    "( [ ap12 ] ) .    in the typical experiment",
    "only one of the two annihilation gamma quanta is detected ( see , e.g. the review @xcite ) .",
    "for a low energy positrons an observed linewidth is determined by a doppler broadening associated with the average momentum of the bound electron .",
    "because of that the annihilation linewidth is given by @xcite : @xmath84 thus , the annihilation on the inner shells contributes to the wings of the line , while annihilation on the outermost shell gives the central peak .",

    "the width of the convolution is the sum of the widths of the components , i.e. @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the width of the fourier transform of the valence orbital @xmath1 .",
    "the exchange term starts to dominate the tail at the distances between @xmath48 and @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "even if we take @xmath91 close to @xmath7 we get the width two times larger than for the outermost orbital .",
    "however , @xmath91 is closer to @xmath48 since it plays a role of the cut - off factor in the expansion over @xmath96 in the exchange coulomb interaction between inner and outer electron .",
    "for @xmath97 we return to eq .",
    "( [ eq_width ] ) . in both cases the annihilation on the asymptotic part of the inner orbital @xmath88 indeed contribute to the wing of the @xmath85 line .",
    "we conclude that in the annihilation experiment we can control the final state of the ion .",
    "unfortunately it is not the case for the position of the annihilated electron .",
    "still , the positron can not penetrate deep into the atom because of the strong repulsion from the nucleus .",

    "this is much smaller than the typical tunneling distance in the dc electric field , making positron annihilation much more sensitive to the inner shell contributions . on the other hand ,",
