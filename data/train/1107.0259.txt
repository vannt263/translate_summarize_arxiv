    "coherent states were introduced in quantum mechanics by schrdinger in 1926 to describe minimum uncertainty wave packets that satisfy the correspondence principle .",
    "the standard coherent states are defined as translations of the gaussian ground state of the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the peculiarity of those states is that , during the time evolution in such a potential , they remain of minimum uncertainty at all times .",
    "this remarkable quasi - classical evolution is highly non trivial in quantum mechanics , the general rule being the spreading of the wave packet and the delocalization of the probability density .",
    "the harmonic oscillator coherent states arise in systems whose dynamical symmetry group is the heisenberg - weyl group .",
    "they can be generalized to systems with different symmetry groups , like the su(2 ) spin coherent states , and appear in a wide range of physical situations @xcite .",
    "if an initial gaussian wave packet is subjected to the action of an anharmonic potential , it will generally spread out . in some cases , after the initial spreading , the quantum state may , periodically , come back almost completely to its initial state .",
    "this revival of the wave packet occurs in systems where the spectrum may be expanded locally in terms of a quantum number , a characteristic situation of one - dimensional integrable hamiltonian systems @xcite . in contrast , if the corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic , the wave packet will spread and relax towards the phase space chaotic region , with time dependent fluctuations of the density that reflect interference effects .",
    "the structure of the underlying classical hamiltonian thus has a strong influence on the dynamics of the packet , and may produce quite different effects depending on the integrable or chaotic nature of the classical dynamics @xcite .    here",
    "we are interested in a situation where the classical dynamics is simple , we consider integrable one - dimensional hamiltonian systems .",
    "however , the difficulty is related to the more general character of the quantum dynamics considered , since we include nonlinear terms in the schrdinger equation . the resulting nonlinear schrdinger equation ( the gross - pitaevskii equation , gpe ) has a wide range of physical applications .",
    "it emerges , in particular , in two important cases : in the description of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of weakly interacting particles @xcite , and in the description of electromagnetic waves ( light ) propagating through a nonlinear medium @xcite .",
    "the first point we are interested in is to determine if , in the nonlinear case , there still exist coherent states , in the sense of a set of initial states that are able to propagate in time without spreading or changing their shape .",
    "this question is particularly relevant in the context of becs , since the mere existence of a coherent motion means , physically , that the condensate is preserved in time and that the atoms do not diffuse to different modes during the motion .",
    "we consider here the particular case of a positive nonlinear coefficient , which corresponds to a bec of repulsive interactions , or to a defocusing medium in nonlinear optics .",
    "the most elementary expectation would be that the additional repulsive nonlinear term in the schrdinger equation enhances the spreading of an initial wave packet .",
    "this is of course true for the free propagation .",
    "however , as in the case of the linear schrdinger equation , we find that a particular role is played by the harmonic confining potential .",
    "for that potential it is shown that the phase - space translations of the nonlinear ground state behave as coherent states , e.g. during the time evolution the center of the packet follows a classical phase - space trajectory , without any change of its shape .",
    "these translations therefore constitute a set of nonlinear coherent states which will be properly defined in section  [ 2a ] .",
    "this behavior is specific of the harmonic potential .",
    "furthermore , we study the stability of the nonlinear coherent states under deformations of their shape . for small deformations ,",
    "the packet remains coherent and its center follows the corresponding classical trajectory , with superimposed small shape oscillations of frequency given by the multipole modes of the ground state .",
    "remarkably , this result holds also for large initial perturbations . for instance",
    ", the motion of a very compressed initial gaussian state can be decomposed into a standard dipolar motion of its center and a superimposed large amplitude shape expansion and compression cycle .",
    "the next relevant question concerns the evolution of a nonlinear coherent state subjected to an arbitrary 1d confining potential .",
    "in contrast to the linear case , when both anharmonicities and nonlinearities are present the spreading and revival of the packet are not observed , and a new phenomenology emerges.we find , as in previous studies @xcite , that for small anharmonicities and small amplitudes of oscillation the packet keeps , to a good approximation , its coherence .",
    "its center follows a classical trajectory with superimposed small shape fluctuations .",
    "however , as the anharmonicity or the amplitude increase , a new process appears .",
    "the packet splits into two components , where part of the packet is damped towards the bottom of the potential , while the rest leaves the packet to form an uncoherent higher energy phase - space cloud .",
    "we consider the one dimensional time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation : @xmath0 which describes , in the mean - field approximation , the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath1 identical bosons , in the presence of repulsive interactions ( @xmath2 ) , in an external potential @xmath3 @xcite . here",

    "we assume that @xmath8 , and look for solutions of the gpe which evolve in time without changing their shape .",
    "we thus seek for solutions in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real functions of time .",

    "the experimental realization of nonlinear coherent states , as well as the control of their initial phase - space location , is a natural procedure in the context of cold atom physics .",

    "in particular , they are stable under shape deformations . we have computed the corresponding frequencies of oscillation for different nonlinearities . in the presence of a harmonic potential ,",
    "the nonlinear coherent states thus preserve their coherence during the time evolution .",
    "the physics is quite different when the nonlinear coherent states evolve in an anharmonic potential .",
    "we found that the time evolution now leads to a partial destruction of the initial packet ( or of the condensate in becs ) . during the time evolution ,",
    "the system splits into two components .",
    "a fraction of the initial density leaves the packet , to occupy high energy phase space trajectories ( evaporative process ) .",
    "the remaining fraction of the packet continues to oscillate around the bottom of the well but , by energy conservation , its amplitude now decreases ( damping process ) .",
    "the anharmonicity of the potential thus induces a coupling between the dipole mode and other excitation modes .",
    "the initial center of mass kinematic energy is now partially transferred to a fraction of the particles , that leave the system , while the amplitude of the collective dipole motion of the remaining coherent component is damped .",
    "this process depends on the anharmonicity and on the initial amplitude through the parameter @xmath146 , with a stronger damping for stronger values of @xmath146 .    in the presence of interactions , the revival phenomenon that occurs in linear quantum mechanics thus disappears and",
    "is replaced by a totally different mechanism . in the language of cold atom physics",
    ", the condensate is partially destroyed and damped when it evolves in an anharmonic confining potential .",
    "coherent transport and superfluidity are often tested by adding an external perturbation , like for instance the study of the damping of dipolar oscillations in becs in the presence of an obstacle @xcite . in 1d , the dissipative mechanism that breaks superfluidity",
    "is related to the emission of solitons .",
    "also , loss of coherence and damping of collective excitations are predicted as temperature increases @xcite .",
    "here , we have shown loss of coherence and dissipative effects in the absence of obstacles , simply induced by the presence of anharmonicities in the confining potential .",
    "many interesting problems remain open , like a study of the motion of initial nonlinear packets in higher dimensional potentials , integrable or chaotic .",
    "the nature of the evaporative process described here should be further investigated using methods that go beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "many studies already exist for the propagation of 1d packets in the presence of random potentials @xcite .",
    "however , the present one - dimensional results show already the deep differences that exist between the linear and nonlinear cases in the presence of simple potentials . experimental tests of these differences are relatively easy , in particular in the cold atom context , by shifting a bec with respect to an anharmonic potential . in this article",
    "we have also explored the nonlinear dynamics of gaussian wave packets in both harmonic and anharmonic potentials , a problem that is relevant in optics experiments .",
    "we thank m. albert and n. pavloff for fruitful discussions , and t. paul for providing us a nonlinear schrdinger equation program . this work was supported by the ecos - sud grant a09e05 .",
