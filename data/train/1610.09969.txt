    "<S> it is shown that unlike the isotropic case , the physics is determined by the phonons with wavevectors of the order of @xmath1 , where @xmath1 determines the crossover between harmonic and anharmonic behavior of the flexural phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density of the holes in single - layer black phosphorus at finite temperatures is calculated .    </S>",
    "<S> few - layer black phosphorus attracts a lot of attention now as a prospective two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconducting material with a tunable energy gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> being , as other 2d materials , an atomic - thick crystalline membrane , it is affected by thermal flexural fluctuations which results in anomalous structural and mechanical properties at finite temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested @xcite that these thermal fluctuations can essentially influence on the states of charge carriers in 2d semiconductors and even lead to an autolocalization , that is , formation of a self - trapped state ( flexuron ) . that general consideration assumed an isotropic electronic spectrum whereas black phosphorus is highly anisotropic , with dramatically different effective masses , @xmath0 . especially , in the hole - doped case the situation is quite peculiar , with a formation of van hove singularity near the top of the valence band which is essentially enhanced by mass anisotropy @xcite . one can expect that the holes in single - layer black phosphorus ( also called phosphorene ) are quasi - one - dimensional quasiparticles and thus are strong candidates for a pronounced effect of localization due to interaction with bosonic modes .    in general , deformation of the lattice in 2d materials results in distortion of the carrier dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> for different types of deformations this effect can be accounted for by different phonon modes interacting with fermionic charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction parameters then can be determined either from experiment or from different theoretical approaches . in 2d materials like graphene or black phosphorus </S>",
    "<S> it is a well - justified approach to separate in - plane from out - of - plane , or flexural phonon modes for not too small wavevectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for smaller wavevectors these modes begin to interact which results in changing of the functional form of the correlation function dependence on the wavevector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this will be discussed in more detail below , in particular for the anisotropic case .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the spectral function and the density of hole states ( dos ) in black phosphorus renormalized due to the interaction with flexural phonons . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we use the diagrammatic approach and calculate the hole self - energy using the ward identity as a low momentum transfer approximation for the vertex . </S>",

    "<S> before we proceed , note that averaging of @xmath26 yields a constant that just shifts the whole fermionic band and has no non - trivial effects . to account for those we have to calculate the second cumulant of the bosonic field </S>",

    "<S> we argue that for energies far enough from the band edge only small momentum transfers play a role @xcite , so that we neglect momentum dependence of the vertex and of the self - energy and use the ward identity for the vertex : @xmath33 ending up with the following closed differential equation for the self - energy : @xmath34    now we go on to estimate @xmath35 for the anisotropic case , which is a question of its own significance . </S>",
