    "there is an increasing effort in including feedback - couplings into the underlying evolution equations .",
    "such memory - controlled effects should be a further unifying feature of complex physical @xcite as well as biological systems @xcite far from equilibrium .",
    "whereas most of the papers are addressed to a purely time dependent but homogeneous memory , the present one gives an extension to spatially dependent processes . such systems , however without memory effects , are widely discussed in physics @xcite and biology @xcite . based on our recent studies of several evolution models @xcite , where such non - markovian memory effects had been enclosed , and on the analysis of chemical reactions @xcite , we focus now on the diffusive behavior with memory couplings .",
    "these effects have an essential influence on the long time behavior , but they have also an impact on the dynamics in an intermediate time regime . as the consequence of the interplay between conventional diffusive transport and feedback",
    "we demonstrate the occurrence of non - trivial stationary solutions forming patterns .",
    "+ our analysis should be grouped into the continuing interest in feedback couplings .",
    "a memory dominated behavior is well established in analyzing the freezing processes in under - cooled liquids @xcite , where the underlying mathematical representation is based on a projector formalism proposed by mori @xcite . as the result of the projection procedure the irrelevant degrees of freedom , fluctuating on short time and short length scales , contribute to the time evolution of the relevant degrees of freedom as well as by instantaneous and by delay - controlled terms .",
    "since the projection formalism is not restricted to selected systems , the modification of the evolution equation due to memory effects is rather general . here",
    "the relevant quantity may be the concentration of certain species or the probability density for a particle .",
    "the crucial influence of memory effects can be illustrated by considering a single particle moving in a disordered environment . due to the strong disorder each member of an equally prepared ensemble",
    "makes experience by its own surrounding , which is even modified by the random walk of the single particle itself .",
    "such a behavior can be described by a non - linear fokker - planck equation with an additional memory term as had been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the analytical results , based on a one - loop renormalization group analysis , is in accordance with numerical simulations @xcite and further analytical studies @xcite . whereas in that approach",
    "the memory effects are believed to be originated by the inherent non - linear interaction of the many particle system themselves , i. e. the time scale of the memory is determined by the relevant variable itself , there is a broad class of models which are subjected to external delay effects @xcite ; for a survey and applications in biology , see @xcite . even in traffic models",
    "such memory effects has been discussed @xcite . +",
    "recently @xcite memory effects in correlated anisotropic diffusion are studied in nanoporous crystalline solids .",
    "likewise the effects of transport memory are discussed within the fishers equation @xcite , also applicable for bacterial population dynamics @xcite .",
    "there appear a non - linear damping and traveling wave solutions @xcite .",
    "the transport with memory , depending on the survivability of a population , is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "+ regarding the large variety of systems with feedback couplings it seems to be worth to study simple models , which still include the dynamical features of evolution models as conservation of the relevant quantity @xmath0 and moreover , a time - delayed coupling . in the present paper we emphasize in an analytical solvable model with spatio - temporal feedback coupling .",
    "the generic behavior of the system may be changed by those additional delay effects .",
    "in particular , we discuss the transport behavior which is realized after a sufficient accumulation time and after cumulating particles within a spatial region .",
    "we show that the processes are affected by additional spatial and temporal correlations leading to non - trivial steady state solutions .",
    "in case the transport is realized after a spatial - temporal accumulation process the time evolution of the probability could also depend on the history of the sample to which it belongs , i.e. the changing rate of the probability should be influenced by the changing rate in the past .",
    "thus the evolution of the probability @xmath0 has to be supplemented by memory terms .",
    "such a term models , for example the way on which a seed probability at a certain time @xmath1 had been accumulated by a delayed transport mechanism , originated by the surrounded environment of the particle . in general , the changing rate of @xmath2 at time @xmath3 is also determined by the accumulation rate at a former time @xmath4 . in between ,",
    "i.e. within the interval @xmath5 , the particles are enriched while changing the probability at @xmath1 . regardless",
    "that process the available amount of particles at time @xmath3 is governed by an instantaneous transport term as well as by the changing rate at former times @xmath1 .",
    "consequently the conventional diffusion equation should be modified according to @xcite @xmath6 this equation is of convolution type . whereas the operator @xmath7 characterizes the instantaneous and local processes , both operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 are responsible for the delayed processes .",
    "in general the operators @xmath10 and @xmath9 may be also non - linear in @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "they have to be specified according to the physical situation in mind .",
    "in particular we show that the operators are restricted when @xmath12 is assumed to be conserved .      in this section",
    "we specify the model , defined by eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , under the assumption that the basic quantity @xmath0 is conserved .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by @xmath13 to preserve @xmath2 the instantaneous term @xmath7 has to be related to a current , e.g. @xmath14 .",
    "choosing natural boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath15 at the boundary , we find after laplace transformation @xmath16 @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "for an arbitrary polynomial kernel @xmath19 the conservation law is in general not fulfilled provided the operator @xmath9 is simply defined by @xmath20 ( the minus sign is only for convention ) . making this ansatz",
    "we conclude from eq .",
    "( [ ev2 ] ) @xmath21[\\hat{k}(z ) + 1 ] = 0\\ ] ] and consequently the conservation law is guaranteed .",
    "physically , the assumption for @xmath9 means , that we take into account a coupling of the rates , e.g. the evolution at the observation time @xmath3 is directly coupled to the changing rate at @xmath4 .",
    "processes in the past will be permanently `` reevaluated '' at present time . in doing",
    "so the memory kernel gives rise to a coupling of the time scales . in the vicinity of the upper limit",
    "@xmath22 the memory term reads @xmath23\\partial_t p(\\vec r , t)$ ] , i.e. a instantaneous change at the observation time @xmath3 is coupled to the value of @xmath2 at the initial time @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the very past is related to the instantaneous value of @xmath0 . in the opposite case , at the lower limit @xmath25 , the change of the quantity @xmath0 near to the initial value @xmath26",
    "is directly coupled to the instantaneous value @xmath0 via the kernel . in such a manner",
    "the memory part represents a weighted coupling of the behavior at the initial time and the observation time .",
    "due to that coupling of the rates the long - time behavior of the system will be modified .",
    "one reason for that could be that the moving particle is embedded into an environment of all the other particles of the system . due to the mutual interaction ,",
    "the particle is released after a certain waiting time @xmath27 . especially in sufficiently complex diffusion - reaction systems the feedback and memory effects should be relevant . in such system additional degrees of freedom like in flexible macromolecules in melts or in concentrated solutions @xcite , nematic elastomer @xcite or in biology @xcite . in that context one",
    "is interested in the description of effluent reprocessing plants in systems with closed water circulation .",
    "a special ecosystem of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms is evolved in the clarifiers of such systems due to natural immigration or due to additional allowance .",
    "the living conditions of the microorganisms are mutually associated via the exchange of intermediate catabolic products .",
    "each change of the concentration of one species will be stored in the food chain and effects the evolution of these species at a later time .",
    "furthermore , the partial mixing in the clarifiers by convection and diffusion processes enlarges the effects over the whole system , so that the memory integral introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) includes both , the time and the spatial coordinates .",
    "this special example may be extended also to other complex biological , chemical or engineering problems with various hidden degrees of freedom , which are able to influence the evolution of a selected component significantly , for instance by biological interaction with other species via the food chain or via biological competition .",
    "such effects which are partially observable , could contribute to the memory term .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) we can make some general statements for an arbitrary kernel @xmath28 and the specialized term @xmath29 . as stressed before the last condition guarantees the conservation of @xmath0 .",
