    "biofilms are among the most ancient evidence of life on earth : they appear as fossils of microbial mats and stromatolites from western australia dating back to about 3.5 billion years ago  @xcite .",
    "thus , it should come as no surprise that biofilms are the most widespread form of life  @xcite .",
    "they form extremely diverse and complex structures , are capable of colonizing almost every environment , and have evolved a vast arsenal of biological responses to environmental stimuli . today we know that all three domains of life can produce biofilms : bacteria  @xcite , archaea  @xcite , microalgae  @xcite and fungi  @xcite all produce biofilms .",
    "but the understanding that most microorganisms live in aggregates rather than in a planktonic state has only recently emerged .",
    "antonie van leeuwenhoek observed `` _ _ animalcules _ _ '' in the plaque of his own teeth under a microscope of his fabrication .",
    "his report in @xmath0 marks the discovery of biofilms  @xcite .",
    "however , only in the first half of the twentieth century with the work of henrici  @xcite and zobel  @xcite was the import of biofilms really appreciated by the scientific community , and finally the word biofilm was first used in 1981  @xcite , which marks the recognition of its function and organization .",
    "biofilms are structured , self - organized communities of microorganisms that synthesize a protective matrix and adhere to each other and/or to an interface  @xcite .",
    "they can be populated by a single species but more often multiple species are present .",
    "the level of complexity and specialization present in biofilms brings to mind the analogy to a large , bustling city  @xcite with different levels of organization  @xcite .",
    "biofilms can grow on solid surfaces in the presence of water virtually anywhere , for example on pebbles in a river bed ( the periphyton ) , in deep - sea hydrothermal systems  @xcite and vents  @xcite , or on boat hulls ; biofilms can also grow at the air - water interface of limnic or marine environments  @xcite .",
    "like the inhabitants of a city , the microorganisms in a biofilm can modify their surroundings .",
    "cellular metabolism can either increase the porosity of geologic media by the dissolution of minerals , or reduce the porosity by precipitating secondary minerals or by clogging the pores with biomass .",
    "microbial activity can change the electrochemical properties , surface roughness , elastic moduli , stiffness , as well as seismic and magnetic properties of minerals through the precipitation of bacterial magnetosomes .",
    "in general , biofilms play a role in so many geophysical processes that a new discipline is now emerging : biogeophysics  @xcite .",
    "biofilms play a role also in human activities .",
    "their growth has an enormous impact in biomedical sciences  @xcite .",
    "microbial ecosystems can grow on the surface of teeth and on open wounds ; they can infest the respiratory mucous and the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis pneumonia . _",
    "pseudomonas aeruginosa _",
    ", for example , lives normally ( and harmlessly ) on our skin but if it enters the blood circulation of immunocompromised individuals it can infect organs of the urinary and respiratory system , bones and joints .",
    "medical devices such as catheters , prosthetic heart valves , cardiac pacemakers , skull implants , cerebrospinal fluid shunts and orthopedic devices can harbor pathogens  @xcite , and due to the intimate contact of these medical tools with the human body biofilms can grow and trigger virulent infections .",
    "biofilms cause billions of dollars in damage to metal pipes in the oil and gas industry , and metal structures in water treatment plants .",
    "sulfate - reducing bacteria , for example members of the _ acidithiobacillus _ genus , transforms molecular hydrogen into hydrogen sulfide which , in turn , produces sulfuric acid that corrodes metal surfaces causing catastrophic failures  @xcite .",
    "biofilms have , however , also found useful employment in environmental biotechnology .",
    "they are used in a well - established technique for wastewater treatment  @xcite , or for _ in situ _",
    "immobilization of heavy metals in soil  @xcite .",
    "biofilms allow to process large volumes of liquids , and they naturally grow by converting organic materials .",
    "furthermore , microorganisms ( typically bacteria and fungi ) can be used for microbial leaching , that is , as a way to extract metals from ores  @xcite .",
    "copper , uranium and gold are examples of metals commercially recovered by microorganisms  @xcite .",
    "numerous experimental studies have determined that biofilms have a heterogeneous structure and composition  @xcite which vary greatly among different species .",
    "but we also know that they share some fundamental elements .",
    "microorganisms colonizing an interface produce a mass of biopolymers , collectively termed",
    "_ extracellular polymeric substance _ ( eps ) , that provides protection and structural stability to the cells .",
    "the eps also performs numerous functions specific to the biofilm state , such as creating its three - dimensional architecture , protection against physical , chemical and biological agents , providing an external digestive system , facilitating cell - cell signaling and horizontal gene transfer  @xcite .",
    "the eps matrix represents up to @xmath1 of the dry mass of the biofilm ( the remaining being the cells ) and is composed of polysaccharides , proteins , humic acids , dna , lipids , and remnants of lysed cells  @xcite .",
    "( however , there are exceptions : some strains of _ staphylococcus epidermidis _ and _ staphylococcus aureus _ produce smaller amounts of eps . )",
    "figure  [ fig : biofilm - sketch ] shows a sketch of a biofilm with its primary elements .",
    "below , we briefly describe these components and highlight their functions in the biofilm .",
    "@xmath2 polysaccharides are long , linear or branched , polymeric chains that are ubiquitously found in biofilms , and represent their largest component  @xcite .",
    "the number and diversity of these molecules is stunning .",
    "very little can be said in general about them as the number of chemical and structural possibilities is virtually infinite  @xcite .",
    "gram - negative bacteria typically produce polyanionic polysaccharides , or in some cases neutral ones , due to the presence of uronic acids or ketal - linked pyruvates ; some chemical linkages ( @xmath3- or @xmath4-@xmath5-linked hexose ) provide backbone rigidity to the polymers , while other linkages produce more flexible polymers  @xcite .",
    "diverse microscopy methods  @xcite show that polysaccharides form a complex network of fine strands linking cells to each other and to the substratum .",
    "polysaccharides are involved in most processes that take place in a biofilm  @xcite : ( _ i _ ) _ adhesion _ ; for example , the polysaccharides pel and psl ( named after the operons involved in pellicle formation and polysaccharide synthesis locus , respectively  @xcite ) are essential for the adhesion of _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ to a variety of substrata and they provide redundant mechanisms for this task  @xcite .",
    "( _ ii _ ) _ structural stability and cohesion _ ; the polysaccharides of algae form rigid structures because the binding ( chelation ) of ca@xmath6 or sr@xmath6 ions forms cross - linked polymer networks  @xcite .",
    "because bacterial polysaccharides are often acetylated , the interaction between polymers is reduced and so is the resulting network - forming ability  @xcite ; for example , _ pseudomonas fluorescens _ requires an acetylated form of cellulose for the effective colonization of the air - liquid interface  @xcite , and n - acetylglucosamines are crucial for intercellular adhesion in the biofilm of _ staphylococcus epidermidis _",
    "@xcite , a major cause of nosocomial infections .",
    "( _ iii _ ) _ hydration _ ; polysaccharides can bind water molecules ( for example , hyaluronic acid can bind the considerable amount of @xmath7  kg of water per @xmath7 g of saccharide  @xcite ; however , most molecules will probably bind less ) . because the polysaccharides form an entangled polymer network they are subject to an osmotic pressure @xmath8 such that will swell with water until the shear modulus of the network @xmath9",
    "@xcite . a hydraulic decoupling between unsaturated soil bacteria and",
    "the vadose zone has been hypothesized to protect the cells from cycles of wetting and drying events  @xcite .",
    "( _ iv _ ) _ storage of nutrients _ ; both the polysaccharide network itself and absorbed organic matter serve as a source of carbon during periods of nutrient deprivation  @xcite .",
    "( _ v _ ) _ protection from toxic ions _ ; the exopolysaccharides can adsorb toxic ions such as cd , zn , pb , cu , and sr  @xcite ; for example , _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ in a biofilm is up to @xmath10 times more resistant to zn , cu and pb than in the planktonic state  @xcite .",
    "( _ vi _ ) _ antibiotic protection _ ; _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ infecting cystic fibrosis patients can change to a mucoid phenotype characterized by increased production of the polysaccharide alginate , but the biofilm contains also pel and psl .",
    "all three components have been found to have a protective role against antibiotics  @xcite .",
    "( _ vii _ ) _ reservoir of enzymes _ ; enzymes are stored , accumulated and stabilized by the polysaccharide network  @xcite ; for example , it has been suggested  @xcite that epilithic biofilms of microorganisms growing on river beds ( a highly changeable environment ) benefit from the accumulation of enzymes because , firstly , the products of enzymatic activity are readily available to the cells , secondly , they may additionally trigger new enzymatic activity in adjacent cells , and , thirdly , new generations do not need to spend energy on enzyme synthesis .",
    "( _ viii _ ) _ sink for excess carbon _ ; when supplied with excess c , the production of polysaccharides is greatly enhanced  @xcite                 @xmath2 extracellular dna has been found not to be merely debris left from lysed cells but an actively produced component of the eps that plays a crucial role in the formation and structural integrity of the biofilms of _ variovorax paradoxus _ and _ rhodococcus erythropolis _  @xcite .",
    "extracellular dna functions as an intercellular connector in _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ s biofilms  @xcite ; also , if these biofilms are younger than @xmath11 hours they can be dissolved by enzymatic degradation of the extracellular dna  @xcite . the gram - positive _ bacillus cereus _ employs extracellular dna as an adhesin  @xcite",
    "recently , a novel function of extracellular dna has been recognized : antimicrobial activity . by binding and sequestering cations ,",
    "extracellular dna induces physical alterations in the bacterial outer membrane  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 lipids or biosurfactants modify the hydrophobic character of microbial cells and therefore can modify their ease of adhesion to surfaces . for example , lipopeptides produced by _",
    "bacillus subtilis _ change the hydrophobicity of the cells depending on the initial level of hydrophobicity  @xcite .",
    "these functions are also used to protect the biofilm from invading microorganisms . in the late stages of its biofilm ,",
    "_ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ produces rhamnolipids that can disrupt biofilms formed by _",
    "_  @xcite or inhibit the attachment of a variety of bacteria and yeasts  @xcite . _ bacillus subtilis _ and _ licheniformis _ produce biorsurfactants that selectively prevent the adhesion of pathogenic cells  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 proteins are a large component of the eps and have diverse functions .",
    "as enzymes they form an external digestive system for the microorganisms in the biofilm as they break down biopolymers to low - molecular - mass products that can be utilized by the cells  @xcite .",
    "enzymes can degrade the eps matrix  @xcite or protect against oxidizers  @xcite .    finally , non - enzymatic proteins contribute to the structural stability of the eps network by attaching the cellular surface to the polysaccharides .",
    "lectins are one such class  @xcite .",
    "for example , lectins contribute to thicker biofilms in different environmental conditions in _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _  @xcite ; the presence of a plant lectin can greatly influence the biofilm of a rhizobium  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their composition , also the temporal development of biofilms is structured .",
    "five stages have been recognized in the life - cycle of a biofilm  @xcite : ( _ i _ ) the initial attachment of cells to a surface or substratum ; ( _ ii _ ) production of eps and irreversible attachment ; ( _ iii _ ) development of the biofilm architecture ; ( _ iv _ ) maturation of the structure and composition of the biofilm ; ( _ v _ ) dispersal of individual cells from the biofilm that revert to the planktonic phenotype to find a new niche and that close in this way the life - cycle of the biofilm . during dispersal the eps matrix immobilizing the cells",
    "is broken down .",
    "this last stage of the biofilm s life - cycle allows the colonization of new interfaces and it may be necessary when the microenvironment becomes unfavorable to sessile microorganisms .",
    "dispersal is a highly complex process  @xcite involving the production of enzymes to degrade the eps network  @xcite , production of surfactants  @xcite , and induction of motility  @xcite . for more details regarding the important phase of dispersal we refer the reader to a useful review  @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the vast majority of microorganisms can form biofilms points to a strong evolutionary incentive for this cooperative behavior .",
    "biofilms growing in different environments show strikingly similar responses to similar physical stimuli . as fig .",
    "[ fig : biofilm - examples ] shows , fast - moving waters produce similar morphologies called `` streamers '' in very different environments .",
    "quiescent waters induce instead biofilms with more rounded morphologies  @xcite .",
    "these facts point to convergent survival strategies within a biofilm .",
    "indeed , social interactions in microorganisms have been recognized  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of a biofilm mode of life consists not only of the protection from toxins , dehydration , antibiotics , starvation , but also of a synergetic consortium that enhances immensely the chances of survival by sharing resources and allowing differentiation , for example .",
    "for all the reasons mentioned above , it is not surprising that the study of biofilms has attracted enormous interest in microbiology , pharmacology , medicine , industry , and in more recent years also in physics .",
    "in fact , the formation , growth , organization and structure of a biofilm are all processes that need to be understood from a physical point of view . in this review",
    "we explore a selection ( far from being exhaustive ) of key physical processes taking place in a biofilm .",
    "the first important step is the motility .",
    "different kinds of motilities occur in two phases of the biofilm life - cycle : stage ( _ i _ ) , the attachment , and stage ( _ v _ ) , the dispersal .",
    "next , the process of adhesion is decisive for the formation and growth of a stable biofilm .",
    "finally , the mature biofilm resulting from myriad interactions and history - dependent dynamical responses can be viewed , on a macroscopic level , as a biomaterial , that is susceptible of physical characterization .",
    "the topic we address in this review has a multitude of aspects and spans such a broad range of disciplines ( from biochemistry and genetics to hydrodynamics and rheology ) that we can not hope to give a complete depiction of the current knowledge about biofilms .",
    "however , we have made efforts to provide a rather general picture that at least points to the most eminent physical aspects . at times",
    ", this work might appear as pedagogical .",
    "this is intended .",
    "we hope in fact that experts in one discipline will find the discussions of other disciplines connected to biofilms helpful . for further study",
    "we direct to more detailed reviews , such as ref .",
    "@xcite for the concept of multicellularity , and ref .",
    "@xcite for the self - organization of microorganisms .",
    "one glaring aspect of biofilm that we neglect is the genetic and regulatory network of signals that controls the biofilm s formation , maturation and dispersal . for these topics",
    "we recommend the specialized reviews  @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : motility ] we discuss various mechanisms of cellular motility , from the problem of swimming at low reynolds numbers to surface motility . section  [ sec : adhesion ] describes the fundamental physical processes that allow cells to adhere to solid surfaces and thus initiate a biofilm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : viscoelastic ] we discuss the viscoelastic behavior of biofilms as materials and the main physical concepts used in the literature . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experim ] we describe modern advances in the experimental investigation of biofilms propelled by the fields of microfluidics and nanofabrication . in sec .",
    "[ sec : computer ] we review the theoretical and computational models of biofilm growth and dynamics . finally in sec .  [ sec : concl ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "why is motility relevant to biofilms ?",
    "the first , obvious answer is that the approach of microorganisms to a surface is the first step to the constitution of a biofilm .",
    "this corresponds to stage ( _ i _ ) in the life - cycle of a biofilm .",
    "for example , prior to attachment and initiation of a biofilm _ vibrio cholerae _ scans a surface by swimming in its close proximity , using two strategies called roaming and orbiting , which differ in the radius of gyration of the trajectories  @xcite .",
    "swimming is also relevant in the last stage of a biofilm s life - cycle : the dispersal .",
    "cells of _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _",
    "swim away from the internal regions of the biofilm into the bulk liquid to regain access to fresh nutrients  @xcite .",
    "it is often claimed that once formed biofilms are communities of sessile microorganisms .",
    "a new picture has emerged where motility , at least in some species , plays a significant role in the biofilm s structure formation  @xcite , with spatial and temporal heterogeneities in phenotypic differentiation and organization  @xcite .",
    "it must be said , however , that living organisms exhibit a stunning variety of behaviors that refuse to be easily categorized .",
    "in fact , non - swimming species , such as _ staphylococcus epidermidis _ and _ staphylococcus aureus _ can also form biofilms . thus",
    ", swimming motility is by all means not a necessary condition for biofilm formation .",
    "the inevitable generalizations sometimes present in this work should be understood from a physical point of view and not biological : that the physical processes discussed below have been shown to take place in some species does not imply that all biofilm - forming microorganisms display the same characteristics , but rather that they belong to the `` toolbox '' of physical mechanisms available to some species and/or phenotypes , and , as our knowledge of biofilms expands , one should consider that these physical processes might be at play .",
    "six different kinds of motility have been identified among @xmath12 bacterial species belonging to @xmath13 different genera  @xcite : swimming , swarming , gliding , twitching , sliding and darting ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : motility - sketch ] for a sketch of the most important motility modes ) . except for swimming",
    ", all other modes are associated to the presence of a surface .",
    "swimming at or near a surface is actuated through one or more flagella .",
    "let us consider one of the most studied motile bacteria : _",
    "escherichia coli_. it exhibits on average six flagella , @xmath14 to @xmath15 m long and @xmath16 nm thick , randomly distributed around its body .",
    "the flagellum is composed of a basal body ( embedded in the cellular membrane ) , a hook and a filament , that is , a left - handed helix with a pitch of about @xmath17 m and a diameter of about @xmath18 m  @xcite .",
    "when the flagellar motor , driven by the proton motive force , rotates counterclockwise ( ccw ) a helical wave travels along the filament . when all flagella rotate ccw mechanical and hydrodynamical forces group the flagella in a single bundle that propels the bacterium in roughly straight trajectories with speeds up to @xmath19 m/s .",
    "while the bundle rotates ccw at about @xmath20  hz the cell body rotates clockwise ( cw ) at about @xmath21  hz  @xcite because of conservation of angular momentum .",
    "when one or more flagellar motors rotate cw those filaments undergo a polymorphic transition to a right - handed helix .",
    "the bundle of flagella divides and a random reorientational motion called `` tumbling phase '' results .",
    "the tumbling phase allows the cells to change swimming direction , and it is regulated by the chemotactic signal transduction network  @xcite .",
    "_ escherichia coli _",
    "s flagellum has a torsional spring constant @xmath22 dyne cm rad@xmath23  @xcite , but only up to twist angles of @xmath24 ; for larger twist angles a second regime appears with an order of magnitude stiffer response  @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for these two regimes of the flagellar compliance is that the hook exhibit a soft component , which dominates the initial phase of the twist , and the filament has a stiffer compliance , which dominates larger twist angles .",
    "this mechanism has the advantage of removing discontinuities in the motion of the motor , whose dynamics is intrinsically stochastic because it is powered by the passage of protons , which is a poisson process .",
    "hence the waiting times between events is an exponentially distributed random quantity  @xcite .",
    "a microorganism can not swim like a fish for a simple physical reason : the viscous drag dominates the motion  @xcite .",
    "motile cells must instead adopt a different strategy that uses drag forces to their advantage . in the next section",
    "we discuss the hydrodynamic fundamentals of bodies swimming in a viscous fluid .",
    "this is a fascinatingly vast topic . for more details",
    "we recommend specialized works on the general problem of swimming  @xcite , or swarming  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the general physical mechanism that produces propulsion in microorganisms that posses flagella or cilia . on general grounds , the motion of a body immersed in an aqueous environment , that is , a newtonian fluid ,",
    "is described by the navier ",
    "stokes equations @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fluid density , @xmath27 the flow velocity , @xmath28 the pressure , @xmath29 the viscosity , @xmath30 is time , and `` @xmath2 '' is the symbol of scalar product . physically , eq .   represents conservation of linear momentum in the fluid , and eq .   the condition of incompressibiliy of the fluid .",
    "the presence of a body immersed in the fluid is incorporated by the boundary conditions necessary to solve eq .  - . the no - slip boundary condition ( valid for viscous fluids )",
    "states that at the boundary @xmath31 of the body @xmath32 . solving the navier ",
    "stokes equations means obtaining expressions for @xmath27 and @xmath28 that satisfy eq .",
    "- and the boundary conditions .    from this knowledge , the stress tensor @xmath33 can be calculated . for a fluid",
    "the stress tensor can be decomposed as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the unit tensor , that is , into a term corresponding to the pressure stresses , which are isotropic , and a second term called _ deviatoric _ stress tensor @xmath36 that includes viscous ( shear ) or other stresses . for a newtonian fluid",
    "the deviatoric stress depends linearly on the instantaneous values of the velocity gradient , so that one can write @xmath37\\,,\\ ] ] where the superscript ` t ' indicates matrix transposition .",
    "once @xmath33 is found , the total hydrodynamic force @xmath38 and torque @xmath39 acting on the swimming body can be derived from integrals over its surface @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a unit vector normal to the surface .",
    "equation   represent a balance of inertial forces ( the left - hand side ) and viscous forces ( the term @xmath42 ) , thus it is natural to find a way to quantify the relative importance of inertial to viscous forces .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the typical velocity and @xmath45 the characteristic length scale of the swimmer , gives a dimensionless measure of this balance . for a typical microorganism such as _ escherichia coli _",
    "( @xmath46 m ) swimming in water ( @xmath47 kg / m@xmath48 , @xmath49 pa@xmath2s ) with a typical speed @xmath50 m/s the reynolds number @xmath51 .",
    "it is then clear that to study the swimming of microorganisms we can neglect the inertial term in eq .  .",
    "in this limit the flow obeys the stokes equations @xmath52 because the stokes equation is linear and because of eq .",
    "the forces acting on the swimming body are directly proportional to the flow velocities  @xcite .",
    "because the displacement of a solid body can be decomposed at any instant of time as the superposition of a translation with velocity @xmath53 and a rotation with angular velocity @xmath54 ( this is the mozzi ",
    "chasles theorem ) , the instantaneous local velocity of a point can be written as @xmath55 the hydrodynamic force and torque then obey the equations @xmath56 physically , the matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent the coupling of forces to translations , and of torques to rotations , respectively , while the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent cross - term couplings between forces and rotations , and between torques and rotations .",
    "dimensionally , the coefficients of @xmath57 have dimensions of length , @xmath59 and @xmath60 of an area , and @xmath58 of a volume . because of very general arguments  @xcite , which do not depend on the shape of the moving body , these matrices obey the relations @xmath61 thus , the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 are always the transpose of each other .",
    "this means that there is a reciprocity principle for the motion in viscous fluids : the force on a rotating body and the torque on a translating body have the same coupling coefficients .",
    "a moving body with the symmetry of a cube or a sphere will have @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the unit matrix .",
    "physically , the drag force on the body will be collinear with the direction of motion , @xmath65 .",
    "but , for a general shape , the matrix @xmath57 will not be proportional to the unit matrix ; thus , there will be drag anisotropy : @xmath66 , that is , force and velocity are not collinear and the sign indicates the energy loss due to viscous dissipation  @xcite . for example , for a prolate ellipsoid of revolution with one axis much larger than the other , @xmath67 , the matrix @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the unit vector ( versor ) in the direction of the long axis of the ellipsoid , @xmath71 the tensor product .",
    "physically , this means that the drag force normal to the long axis is twice as large than along it .",
    "drag anisotropy is the key physical effect that makes locomotion possible at low reynolds numbers .",
    "consider for example a thin filament , like a bacterial flagellum , deformed by a periodic wave - form .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the cell moves along the @xmath72 axis , and each point on the flagellum moves only in the normal direction to the @xmath72 axis .",
    "a short segment of the filament can be approximated by a straight , thin rod that experiences a viscous drag @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the components of the velocity parallel and perpendicular to the segment tangent , that is , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the drag forces have components along the @xmath72 axis : @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the total force along the x axis , or the propulsion force then results @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "thus , a periodic change in shape and in the direction of beating can produce a net propulsive force in the direction perpendicular to the beating .",
    "similar calculations show that a helical filament rotating about its axis generates a net propulsive force proportional to the rotational velocity  @xcite .",
    "the stokes equation ( eq .  ) is linear and time - independent .",
    "an important consequence of this fact is that if the velocity of motion is reversed , the propulsive force also changes sign .",
    "thus , a scallop moving at vanishing reynolds numbers can not have any net displacement .",
    "this is purcell s famous _ scallop theorem _  @xcite .",
    "note that the theorem is valid only if the sequences of deformations of the moving body is time reversible , nor does it apply close to another surface .",
    "another consequence of a vanishing reynolds number is that the dynamics is overdamped : the rate of change of momentum , that is , the acceleration is negligible .",
    "newton s laws then become simple balances of forces and torques , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . thus",
    ", the swimming problem of a body immersed in a viscous fluid must be described by two opposite forces , a force dipole .",
    "the flow field at position @xmath84 created by a swimmer located at the origin of a coordinate system is @xmath85 \\hat{r}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the versor in the swimming direction , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 the dipole length , and @xmath89 its force .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath89 the swimmer is called `` pusher '' ( @xmath90 ) , such as _ escherichia coli _ , or `` puller '' ( @xmath91 ) , such as algae of the genus _ chlamydomonas _ , which swim with characteristic `` breast stroke '' movements of the flagella .",
    "if we now consider two microorganisms swimming in the same environment , each will be affected by the flow field generated by the other .",
    "this interaction transmitted by the fluid is called a hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "equation   has a number of consequences for the mutual interaction of two swimmers : ( _ i _ ) two side by side pushers attract each other , while two side by side pullers repel each other ; ( _ ii _ ) two pushers aligned along the swimming direction repel , while two similarly aligned puller attract each other .",
    "calculations up to the octupole order  @xcite show that to leading order the hydrodynamic forces and torques between two swimmers moving in the directions @xmath92 , @xmath93 exhibit a nematic symmetry , that is the interactions are invariant for changes @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "dense suspensions of swimmers are unstable to long wavelength fluctuations  @xcite , leading to the so - called `` bacterial turbulence ''  @xcite .",
    "there is however an ongoing debate regarding the role of hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite . on the one hand , a simple model that includes only deterministic",
    ", short - ranged interactions can reproduce the velocity structure functions of dense suspensions of _ bacillus subtilis _",
    "@xcite , and experiments on _ escherichia coli _ have shown that hydrodynamic interactions are washed out by the stochasticity intrinsic in the bacterial motion  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , experiments on confined suspensions of _ b. subtilis _ show that long - range hydrodynamic interactions drive the bacterial collective behavior  @xcite .",
    "as a swimming microorganism approaches a solid surface it will be increasingly affected by the hydrodynamic interactions with the boundary .",
    "four effects have been identified  @xcite : ( _ i _ ) the swimming speed increases near a solid boundary  @xcite because the drag anisotropy increases as the distance to the surface decreases .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the swimming trajectory will change shape .",
    "for example , the flow field generated by _",
    "escherichia coli _",
    "away from any boundary has a cylindrical symmetry , but close to a solid boundary it loses this property .",
    "the rotation of the flagellum produces a force normal to it , while an equal and opposite force is produced also on the cell body .",
    "the resulting torque is the physical origin of the circular , clockwise motion of _ escherichia coli _",
    "( when viewed from the same side of the cell with respect to the surface )  @xcite .",
    "circular trajectories were also seen in bacteria with a single flagellum ( monotrichous ) such as _ vibrio alginolyticus _",

    "the term gliding is used with different meanings in the literature ; for example , the `` social gliding motility '' of _ myxococcus xanthus _ is actuated by type iv pili as they collectively spread over a surface , and small rafts of cells move beyond the boundaries of the expanding colony .",
    "a second motility mechanism termed `` adventurous gliding motility '' does not require pili  @xcite , but rather focal adhesion complexes that assemble at the leading cell pole and disperse at the rear of the cells  @xcite .    as the gliding motion does not require appendages and hydrodynamic interactions are negligible simple models that include only steric interactions and active motion are amenable to describe gliding motility .",
    "experiments on the adventurous gliding motion of _ myxococcus xanthus _ show that collective motion with cluster formation appears for packing fractions @xmath155 and at the transition the cluster size distribution is a power law  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the clusters exhibit giant number fluctuations @xmath156 with @xmath157 for @xmath155  @xcite . a similar exponent was found in a simple model of point particles moving with constant speed and aligning nematically with each other  @xcite . a similar transition to the clustered state",

    "the fact that groups of cells move as a single unit indicates that this is not an active form of movement .",

    "the process of adhesion can be divided into two steps  @xcite : ( _ i _ ) _ docking _ , that is , the cell comes in close proximity of the substratum thanks to motility or brownian motion ; this phase of attachment can be easily reverted and is governed by basic physical interactions based on the coulomb and van der waals forces .",

    "most bacteria and natural or artificial surfaces are negatively charged  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the docking phase of adhesion is possible because of the existence of an equilibrium point between the electrostatic repulsion and the attractive van der waals interaction .",

    "the dlvo theory includes only the effects of van der waals and electrostatic interactions , while neglecting other effects , such as steric , solvation , and depletion forces  @xcite .",

    "further away , at typical distances of @xmath14  nm , there is a small ( secondary ) minimum if the ionic strength is large enough .",
    "we can now describe what happens to a bacterium , in the idealized situation described above , when it approaches a surface .",
    "as a bacterium moves closer to a surface it will experience an energy barrier a few nm away from the surface that can not be overcome by active motility or simple brownian motion .",
    "however , depending on the ionic strength the cell will find the secondary minimum and it will be reversibly bound to the surface . in the following step ( locking ) the biosynthesized pili or eps surmount the barrier and allow the irreversible adhesion to the surface  @xcite . +      the simple picture given by the dlvo theory above describes an idealized situation of homogeneous , charged surfaces interacting",
    ". however , it leaves out the true complexity of the adhesion process of microorganisms . in general terms , there are three main classes of structures that cause drastic deviations from the predictions of the dlvo theory in real measurements of adhesion forces : ( _ i _ ) biopolymers associated with the cellular membrane , ( _ ii _ ) the eps that modifies the physico - chemical properties of surfaces , ( _ iii _ ) appendages , such as pili",
    ". the main features of their roles in adhesion will be reviewed below .",
    "the cellular surface is a physically and chemically heterogeneous structure  @xcite .",
    "for example , the outer membrane of gram - negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) which provide protection from many antibiotics .",
    "lps are composed of a lipid a ( anchored to the outer membrane ) , negatively charged core polysaccharides , and the o - antigen , which can extend @xmath191  nm or more from the outer membrane .",
    "lipopolysaccharides have an inhomogeneous spatial distribution and have been shown to play a key role in the adhesion process  @xcite .",
    "a portion of the o - antigen has been shown to form hydrogen bonds with different mineral substrata  @xcite , and @xmath192 or fewer of these bonds can firmly anchor the cell to a surface  @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of the lps in _",
    "pseudomonas aeruginosa _ are crucial to determine their adhesion to hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces , and the phenotypic variations in the expression of lps can regulate adhesion in their survival strategy  @xcite .",
    "mutations in _ escherichia coli _ s genes involved in lps biosynthesis showed decreased adhesion  @xcite ; removal of up to @xmath193 of lps molecules also drastically decreases adhesion affinity  @xcite .",
    "recent work on _ staphylococcus aureus _ shows that adhesion initiates already at distances of @xmath194 to @xmath20  nm ( where the dlvo theory predicts negligible forces ) , and furthermore the fluctuations of protein density and structure are more important than the details of the binding potential  @xcite .",
    "another important factor in the adhesion process is the eps .",
    "the polymeric macromolecules form noncovalent bonds , such as electrostatic or hydrogen bonds , with the substratum that lead to the adhesion of the biofilm  @xcite ; eps contains many polar portions that anchor to a hydrophilic glass and can turn it from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and therefore renders adhesion thermodynamically favorable  @xcite .",
    "the eps also produces a `` polymeric interaction '' because the macromolecules bound to the cell membrane effectively increase its size and boost the ( attractive ) van der waals interaction with the surface .",
    "additionally , eps macromolecules around the cell can bind with macromolecules adsorbed on the solid surface , thus bridging the electrostatic barrier  @xcite .",
    "the hydrophobic components of the cell membrane also favor adhesion as has been repeatedly shown : hydrophobic cells adhere better than hydrophilic cells  @xcite .",
    "the hydrophobic effect is a consequence of a fundamental aspect of water s molecular structure : the extensive presence of a hydrogen - bond ( h - bond ) network .",
    "when an apolar solute is introduced in bulk water , it will locally disrupt the h - bond network because water molecules can not bind to it . to minimize this disruption the water molecules surrounding the solute will form a cage - like structure : a clathrate . because of the clathrates the water molecules have smaller translational and orientational entropy ; thus this change is unfavorable .",
    "when two apolar moieties are close to each other , it is thermodynamically more favorable to reduce their separation until they are in contact with each other because in this way the surface area of the clathrates is reduced and hence the entropy is maximized  @xcite .",
    "different kinds of pili are also involved in the adhesion process .",
    "type iv pili can bind to inert surfaces bacterial and eukaryotic cells because of adhesins at their tips  @xcite .",
    "the gram - negative bacterium _",
    "_ is among the first to colonize submerged surfaces and in the nonmotile stage of its life cycle produces a stalk tipped by a polysaccharide adhesin that can exert forces in the micronewton range  @xcite .",
    "type i ( one in roman numerals ) and type p pili are short adhesive structures present in gram - negative bacteria such as _ escherichia coli _ and _ salmonella _ species .",
    "they are peritrichate and are not associated with twitching motility  @xcite .",
    "type i pili mediate adhesion to mucosal epithelia and other cells  @xcite .",
    "p pili are composite structures that mediate the adhesion to urinary tract epithelium  @xcite .",
    "gram - positive bacteria , such as _ corynebacteria _ and _ streptococci _ , have also pili , but they are very thin ( @xmath195 to @xmath196  nm ) and have been only recently observed  @xcite .",

    "in fact , exopolymers may play a dual role : first , by coating the biofilm substratum which strengthen adhesion , and second , by forming polymeric bridges between the eps - encased cells and the coated substratum  @xcite .",
    "we now take a larger , almost macroscopic , view of the biofilm and ask the question : how does a biofilm respond to a mechanical perturbation ? clearly a biofilm does not flow as a simple liquid ; it requires some structural stability to allow the colony to grow and prosper .",
    "it is equally clear that a biofilm can not be as rigid as a crystal because it must allow expansion as cells multiply , and it must deform as a response to changing environmental stresses or stimuli .",

    "viscoelastic materials are not - newtonian fluids , that is , they do not obey eq .  .",
    "the newtonian expression works remarkably well for simple liquids composed of small , roughly isotropic molecules .",
    "this happens because of a separation of times scales : the molecular relaxation time is comparable to the time to diffuse one molecular length , which is @xmath198  s. the flow velocity can interfere with these relaxation times only in exceptional cases .",
    "consider now a complex fluid comprised of elongated , flexible molecules that possibly form links with each others .",
    "the molecular relaxation time is now much larger , and can be matched by realistic shear rates .",

    "a viscoelastic material must combine both elastic and viscous response .",
    "the simplest physical model thereof is the maxwell element where an elastic spring and a viscous dashpot are combined in series ( see fig .",

    "we consider at first a one - dimensional problem .",
    "for this configuration the stresses on the two elements are equal @xmath207 and the deformations are additive , hence @xmath208 .",

    "experimentally , a common rheological technique to characterize viscoelastic materials is the measurement of the stress - strain curve .",
    "the sample is subject to a shear stress which increases monotonically with time up to a maximum value ; this corresponds to the `` loading '' phase .",
    "subsequently , the shear stress is decreased ; this is the `` unloading '' phase .",
    "the presence of hysteresis is characteristic of viscous dissipation in the material .",
    "another common rheological technique is the creep test , where a stress is applied for a prolonged interval of time and then suddenly released .",
    "the temporal evolution of the strain exhibits characteristic regions corresponding to different processes taking place : ( _ i _ ) an instantaneous elastic stretching , ( _ ii _ ) a viscous flow , ( _ iii _ ) after the external stress ceases there is an instantaneous elastic recoil , ( _ iv _ ) a time - dependent creep recovery  @xcite .",
    "the experimental investigation of biofilms material properties is still in an early stage , and different models are proposed to explain the experimental data .",
    "for example , the biofilms of different _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ strains were subject to strain and creep tests and the results were fitted with a jeffreys model that includes a slow nonlinearity to account for the shear - thickening behavior  @xcite .",
    "that theory correctly predicts the relaxation time at high shear rates .",
    "however , the biofilm of _ streptococcus mutans _ ( common in dental plaque ) showed creep compliance consistent with a burgers model  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : viscoel](d ) ) .",
    "biofilms vary greatly in their composition and structure .",
    "the biofilm of _ streptococcus mutans _ appears to be shear - thinning  @xcite ; the biofilms of the microalga _ chlorella vulgaris _ also shows shear - thinning behavior  @xcite . _",
    "pseudomonas aeruginosa _ builds instead a shear - thickening biofilm  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it should not be surprising that measurements based on creep tests of @xmath234 biofilms determined values of @xmath205 and @xmath29 spanning eight decades  @xcite .",
    "however , they also found a remarkably small range of variability for the elastic relaxation time @xmath235 , with an average of @xmath13  min  @xcite .",
    "it is argued that this common relaxation time can hardly be a coincidence , but rather a sign of convergent evolution .",
    "the time scale @xmath236 separates the solid - like from the liquid - like behavior of a biofilm .",
    "short mechanical stresses can be absorbed by an elastic response , but a sustained stress can be deleterious as it could lead to structural failure , the biofilm reacts instead as a viscous fluid for long time - scale stresses .",
    "the time scale of @xmath13 min coincides with the time required to elicit a phenotypic response at the cellular level  @xcite , which is however expensive in terms of cellular resources .",
    "thus , the elastic relaxation time needs to be large enough to avoid unnecessary response to intermittent stresses , but smaller or approximately equal to the biological time to initiate expensive genetically - regulated responses  @xcite .    a biofilm growing under flow conditions develops characteristic elongated , filamentous structures called _ streamers _ ( see fig .

    "as the eps network of streamers percolates through the channels or pores more and more planktonic cells are caught within it .",
    "eventually , the streamers lead to a catastrophic clogging of the pores that stops the flow  @xcite .",
    "biofilms grown up to reynolds numbers of @xmath237 produced streamers that behaved as viscoelastic solids for stresses lower than the value at which they were grown , but behaved like viscoelastic fluids at larger stresses  @xcite , that is similar to a bingham fluid . in the linear regime streamers exhibited a shear modulus of @xmath238  n / m@xmath239 and a young modulus in the range of @xmath240 to @xmath12  n / m@xmath239  @xcite .",
    "strong flow conditions , in the turbulent regime , produce ripple structures in mixed species biofilms that migrate with a speed of @xmath241m / h  @xcite . at @xmath242",
    "the ripples have a wavelength of about @xmath243 m , but it increases to about @xmath244 m at @xmath245 .",
    "the ripples moves downstream , which points at an important effect for surface colonization .",
    "furthermore the morphology of the ripples responded within minutes to changes in the flow velocity .",
    "this fact indicates that the formation of ripples must have a hydrodynamical origin .",
    "indeed , recent work  @xcite on fossilized microbial mats called kinneyia confirms this .",
    "kinneyia are sedimentary fossils characterized by ripples with wavelength between @xmath195 and @xmath16  mm .",
    "theory and experiments using an artificial biofilm shows that the rippled structures can be explained by the ancient flowing of water above the mats that produced a kelvin  helmholtz instability  @xcite .",
    "this hydrodynamic instability occurs at the interface between two fluids with different viscosities and flowing with different velocities and produces ripples with wavelength proportional to the thickness of the biofilm .",
    "this theory predicts morphologies , wavelengths and amplitudes consonant with the fossil samples  @xcite .",
    "two important challenges have been identified for future investigations of biofilms from the point of view of rheology and complex fluids  @xcite : ( _ i _ ) the structure and morphology of biofilms depend on their history of growth and on the substratum ; for example , the biofilm of _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ growing in human lungs and airways incorporates dna and the f - actin protein  @xcite , which modify the material properties of the biofilm with respect to a lab - grown sample .",

    "the threshold density for each compartment grows with time .",
    "this fact models the consolidation process due to physical forces acting on the biofilm , for example , hydrodynamic forces tend to induce the solid components to pack more densely .",
    "an alternative class of models considers the individual microbial cell , or small groups thereof , as the elementary computational unit  @xcite .",
    "they differ from cellular automata models as there is no underlying lattice partitioning space .",
    "they are called individual - based models , particle - based models , or more generally agent - based models .",
    "the same basic rules as the cellular automata models for metabolism , substrate uptake , cell multiplication and death are used but no global rules on the growth are imposed .",
    "the advantages of agent based simulations are multiple .",
    "first , the absence of a lattice grid avoids artificial results such as fixed growth directions .",
    "second , no global laws ( for the growth , e.g. ) are prescribed , but must emerge from the microscopic dynamics .",
    "third , cells are modeled as hard spheres , and their overlap produces repulsive forces that induces naturally the spreading of the biofilm . furthermore , since individual agents are resolved , it is also natural to introduce genetic variability in the cell s parameters , cell motility  @xcite , coupling with hydrodynamic flow  @xcite , inclusion of metabolic reactions  @xcite , or a viscous fluid model for the eps  @xcite",
    ". however , there are also drawbacks  @xcite : for example , the computational cost of this class of models is typically larger than cellular automata s , and the large - scale structure of biofilm , such as porosity , are less faithfully represented .",
    "biofilms are among the most ancient and most common forms of multicellular organization .",
    "they exhibit astounding complexity both at microscopic and mesoscopic length scales .",
    "their importance has been recognized only in recent decades and research in this field is growing tremendously , fueled by the possibility of treating infectious diseases or of benefiting from their appetite for organic materials in wastewater applications .",
    "we have described the main physical processes involved in the inception , growth and dispersal of biofilms .",
    "a hydrodynamic description is necessary for the initial transition of microbial cells from the planktonic to the sessile state .",
    "details of the physico - chemical nature of the cellular membrane and its appendages are key for the process of adhesion .",
    "biofilms are macroscopically viscoelastic materials with a very complex , history dependent behavior .",
    "progress in the rheological and mechanical characterization will come from studies in conditions mimicking the natural environment .",
    "we have also reviewed modern experimental techniques of investigation such as microfluidics and lab - on - a - chip technologies that use an integrated approach to biofilms with the aim at capturing their heterogeneous and complex nature .",
    "these methods can experimentally `` simulate '' the natural environment of a biofilm and test different hypotheses .",
    "realistic environments are however essential to understand and control the dispersal of biofilms , for example , which has tremendous consequences for ecology and in the context of infectious diseases",
    ". studies of biofilm dispersal , however , are still largely conducted _ in vitro _  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have reviewed the theoretical and computational modeling of biofilms .",
    "computational approaches at simulating a biofilm are now finally coming of age  @xcite and some predictions quantitatively match the experimental data , but much remains to be done .",
    "ahead lies a particularly daunting challenge when considering all the chemical , biological and physical processes involved in a biofilm , which evolve and interact from the nanometer to the millimeter length scale , and from the nanosecond time scale to hours or days .",
    "future lines of development should include realistic models for the eps , either microscopically with a polymer network theory , or mesoscopically with a viscoelastic model .",
    "some attempts are already available  @xcite where the biofilm is modeled with breakable springs in an immersed boundary method , or through a nonlinear , continuum description of worm - like chains  @xcite .",
    "once integrated theoretical and computational models will be developed , they will allow to test and manipulate biofilms under multiple physical , chemical and biological cues , both intrinsic and extrinsic .",
    "we now want to enter a more speculative realm to discuss some mechanisms at play in the biofilm that could be recognized in the future .",
    "the important fact that biofilms represent the most complex effort of simple microorganisms at multicellular organization points to the existence of ` communications ' channels among the individual cells .",
    "we know from the biology of multicellular eukaryotes how a complex , well - regulated and specialized structure may exist .",
    "biofilms are more dynamical and history - dependent in their structure and properties .",
    "however , interactions that lead to specialization must be there also in biofilms .",
    "obvious candidates are quorum sensing and cell signaling . although the role of quorum sensing has been linked multiple times with the growth , structure and function of biofilms , controversial results abound ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a critical review of quorum sensing in relation to biofilms ) .",
    "the reason for the controversy is probably the inadequacy of our experimental tools of investigation to the task : more subtle tools for _ in vivo _ and _ in situ _ analysis are required ; another factor that complicates the picture is that the study of mutants elicits the risk of pleiotropy .",
    "we speculate that quorum sensing and cell signaling provide the communication channels required to generate complex organization .",
    "a second physical aspect that is underrepresented in the study of biofilms is the role of motility .",
    "we have reviewed the available evidence on the function of swimming , swarming and twitching within a biofilm .",
    "we speculate , however , that these motility modes should have a more important role than currently known . while under some physical forces , such as hydrodynamic shear",
    ", a biofilm might respond by forming more compact structures with a sessile population , consortia of different species coexisting , possibly in syntrophic interaction , may utilize motility to assist the spatial segregation often associated with phenotypic differentiation .",
    "biofilms represent still largely unexplored microcosmoses , that will certainly provide numerous surprises in the future .    in this review ,",
    "we have omitted the discussion of some crucial aspects in the life - cycle of a biofilm : its ecology and genetic regulation .",
    "there is certainly ample space for physical theories of these different levels of interaction .",
