    "soon after the discovery of the quantum statistics by fermi @xcite and dirac @xcite , which incorporates pauli s exclusion principle @xcite , the ideal fermi gas ( ifg ) has been extensively used to describe , approximately , many physical phenomena in a wide range of values of the particles density , from cosmological scales to nuclear ones .    at the end of the 20th century ,",
    "the experimental realization of quantum degeneration of a trapped fermi gas of @xmath2k atoms @xcite raised the interest on the theoretical study of the thermodynamical and dynamical properties of the fermi gas in the ideal approximation @xcite .",
    "more recently , the ifg has been used in the context of quantum information and the entanglement entropy of it has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , while in ref .",
    "@xcite exact relations between the renyi entanglement entropies and the particle number fluctuations in a system of noninteracting fermions have been derived .    on the other hand ,",
    "the thermodynamics of fermi gases at extreme conditions of density and/or temperature are of great interest to understand processes in white dwarf stars @xcite , or the properties of the gluon - quark plasma @xcite , which is thought to occurred , some microseconds after the bing - bang at the early stage of the universe .    in the noninteracting regime ,",
    "analysis of the the relativistic effects on the thermodynamics of the ifg are limited to the consideration of the energy spectrum of a relativistic single - particle @xcite , generally disregarding particle - antiparticle pair production predicted by quantum field theory .",
    "this contrasts to the thermodynamics of the relativistic bose gas which has been thoroughly studied considering pair production @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to fill out this gap .    in the same noninteracting regime , p .- h .",
    "chavanis @xcite discusses the effects of the spatial dimensionality in the balance between quantum pressure due to degeneracy and gravitational collapse due to self - gravitation in white dwarf stars . in his analysis",
    ", the author shows that the collapse or evaporation of the star is unavoidable in dimensions larger than four , giving a special character to systems of spatial dimension @xmath3 through an anthropic principle .",
    "the properties of the electron gas in the star are rather well approximated by those in the limit of complete degeneration , _",
    "i.e. _ by those at zero temperature , due to the disparate difference between the system temperature and the fermi temperature , @xmath4    moreover , the effects of low spatial - dimensionality on the non - relativistic ifg at finite temperatures are exhibited in the form of an _ unusual _ temperature dependence of the chemical potential @xmath5 at constant volume ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "these effects are markedly shown in an ifg trapped in an impenetrable , one dimensional box potential , for which at low temperatures @xmath5 starts rising quadratically with @xmath6 above the fermi energy instead of decreasing from it , as does in the three - dimensional case .",
    "eventually , at larger temperatures , @xmath5 turns to its usual monotonic decreasing behavior at a characteristic temperature that can be as large as twice the fermi temperature .",
    "this unusual behavior has been already related with a possible phase transition with the maximum of the chemical potential pointing out a sort of critical point @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus our study on the thermodynamic properties of the ifg , where the effects of quantum degeneracy , relativity and spatial dimensionality , are all combined .",
    "though , particular attention is paid to the temperature dependence of the chemical potential , which has motivated several discussion of its importance on different levels and contexts @xcite , our main results focus on the thermodynamic susceptibilities or response functions , namely the specific heat at constant volume @xmath7 and the isothermal compressibility @xmath8 for which there is a great interest at conditions of extreme densities and/or temperatures .",
    "interestingly , our calculations reveal the appearance of a transition in the temperature dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath9 due to pair production , that occurs at a few tenths of the fermi temperature .",
    "this drastic qualitative change in behavior can be plausibly considered as a phase transition , from a phase at which the compressibility diminishes with temperature , as in standard matter ( defining the normal phase ) , to another at which matter becomes arbitrarily compressible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ ii ]",

    "<S> the influence of spatial dimensionality and particle - antiparticle pair production on the thermodynamic properties of the relativistic fermi gas , at finite chemical potential , is studied . resembling a kind of phase transition , qualitatively different behaviors of the thermodynamic susceptibilities , namely the isothermal compressibility and the specific heat , </S>",
    "<S> are markedly observed at different temperature regimes as function of the system dimensionality and of the rest mass of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> a minimum in the isothermal compressibility marks a characteristic temperature , in the range of tenths of the fermi temperature , at which the system transit from a normal phase , to a phase where the gas compressibility grows as a power law of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , we find that for a particle density of a few times the density of nuclear matter , and rest masses @xmath0 mev , the minimum of the compressibility occurs at approximately @xmath1 which roughly estimates the critical temperature of hot fermions as those occurring in the gluon - quark plasma phase transition . </S>"
