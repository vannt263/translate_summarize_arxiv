    "over the past one hundred years , special relativity has been one cornerstone of modern physics , well - established by innumerable experiments and observations . an outstanding feature of special relativity is a universal upper limit of speed , namely the light speed @xmath0 in vacuum .",
    "astonishingly , according to a recent result @xcite , this speed record is broken by neutrinos in the opera experiment , confirming an earlier record from the minos detector @xcite .    before drawing a conclusion ,",
    "certainly it is most imperative to check further systematic errors in the measurement .",
    "but it is also intriguing to tentatively make a concession to experimental data and adjust our theories .",
    "this paper is a preliminary attempt to resolve the neutrino velocity anomaly with a complicated tachyonic neutrino model and with a tiny deformation of einstein s mass - energy relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : record ] we summarize main results of the neutrino velocity measurements from literature and remark on some interesting features . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tach ] , we attempt to explain the velocity data in framework of the standard mass - energy relation by introducing a tachyonic mass to neutrinos .",
    "we find the tachyonic neutrino model can not reconcile all data unless the neutrino mass runs with energy .",
    "[ sec : lv ] deviates from the standard mass - energy relation and shows how the wired neutrino velocity can be explained by a scenario of mass - dependent lorentz violation",
    ". models of this scenario are classified in two categories : democratic models universal for all types of matter , and discriminative models sensitive to particle species .",
    "some open questions are covered in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "according to @xcite and references therein , hitherto there are four independent measurements accomplished for neutrino velocity .",
    "we summarize their results in table [ tab - nuspeed ] . in the table",
    "we include neutrino flavors , which is helpful for flavor - dependent explanations of these data .",
    "needless to say , a superluminal velocity of neutrino is highlighted by the positive results @xmath1 from recent minos and opera measurements .",
    "it conflicts apparently with basic laws in special relativity . on the other hand ,",
    "the old fermilab and sn 1987a results are consistent with special relativity .",
    "this is easy to check with eq .",
    "below , provided the neutrino mass is of order @xmath2 .",
    "however , since fermilab and sn 1987a did not tell us the signature of @xmath1 , their results still admit a superluminal velocity of neutrino .",
    "the sn 1987a data is unique .",
    "some comments are in order on this point .",
    "first , its source and baseline are different from others .",
    "the neutrinos have traveled for about 168 thousand years before detection .",
    "second , in contrast to roughly ten thousands of events in other experiments , only a dozen of events are detected for sn 1987a burst .",
    "this leads to a large statistic error not shown in table [ tab - nuspeed ] .",
    "third , thanks to the astronomical length scale of `` baseline '' , sn 1987a puts a very stringent limit on neutrino velocity , which is violated by both minos and opera experiments . each single trustable event from sn 1987a could put the minos and opera results in doubt . reverse the logic , were @xmath3 true for @xmath4 neutrinos , these neutrinos should have advanced their arrival for years than gamma rays from sn 1987a .",
    "the lesson is , when formulating theories , one must pay special attention to the sn 1987a constraint .    the results summarized in table [ tab - nuspeed ] exhibit dependence on energy , flavor and time / century / baseline . such features are illuminating . the purpose of this paper is to explore the energy dependence from the viewpoint of mass - energy relation and lorentz symmetry .",
    "we will adhere to einstein s mass - energy relation in sec .",
    "[ sec : tach ] and deviate from it slightly in sec .",
    "[ sec : lv ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a superluminal velocity can be easily achieved by tachyon with a negative value of squared mass . at the same time",
    ", the neutrino mass has been an enigma for half a century .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments measure the difference of squared masses between orthogonal mass eigenstates .",
    "therefore , it sounds natural to consider neutrinos as tachyons in light of the superluminal phenomenon - decay experiments @xcite , but the `` mass '' scale there is much lower than those in this section . ] . in this section",
    ", we will first develop the simplest version of this idea and then rule it out .",
    "after that , we will pursue the possibility of a tachyonic neutrino mass running with energy .    for convenience ,",
    "we write down einstein s mass - energy relation in the form @xmath5 which relates energy @xmath6 and rest mass @xmath7 of a particle via its velocity @xmath8 and the light velocity constant @xmath0 . for ordinary particles ,",
    "nonnegativity of the right hand side dictates on the left hand side @xmath9 as a well - known feature of special relativity .",
    "inversely , violation of this bound can be realized if we extrapolate relation to tachyons with @xmath10 . for small deviation @xmath11 , reduces to @xmath12 . applied to data",
    ", it gives @xmath13 for opera , @xmath14 for minos , @xmath15 for sn 1987a and @xmath16 for fermilab . in the simplest tachyon model , a constant tachyonic mass of neutrino",
    "can not explain all of the results in table [ tab - nuspeed ] .",
    "within this model , the opera and minos results are marginally at odds with each other , and both of them conflict obviously with the sn 1987a bound .",
    "but one may still imagine that , instead of a constant parameter , @xmath17 is running with energy @xmath6 . because of an unknown mechanism , its running is much larger than the prediction of standard model of particle physics .",
    "then one may reconcile the discrepancies mentioned above by tuning the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , one might be able to tune the running so that @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "this possibility overlaps partly the discriminative models of mass - dependent lorentz violation in sec .",
    "[ subsec : disc ] . an illustrative example and more discussion will be given there .",
    "we warn that tachyonic modes , like ghosts , generally give rise to instabilities in quantum field theory .",
    "a tachyonic neutrino model suffers from the same problem , no matter @xmath17 is a constant or not .",
    "therefore , it is challenging to construct viable models of this type .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , a tachyonic mass of neutrino can not explain observational data in a simple way .",
    "so let us try another scenario by deviating from the lorentz symmetry slightly .",
    "before doing this , we remind the readers that lorentz invariance is a symmetry of minkowski metric and that lorentz boosts are related to some spaceime - dependent conserved quantities .",
    "theoretically , a deformation of lorentz symmetry can be realized by `` curving '' the minkowski spacetime .",
    "observationally , the violation of several conservation laws sheds light on testing our scenario in other approaches .",
    "the main insight is that results in table [ tab - nuspeed ] can be accommodated with a deformation of mass - energy relation as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is an unknown function with the property @xmath25 the deformed relation has a physical interpretation as follows . for any particle of mass @xmath26",
    ", there is a critical energy scale @xmath27 around which the lorentz symmetry is broken down .",
    "the amount of deviation from lorentz symmetry is determined by @xmath24 . in viewpoint of the standard mass - energy relation ,",
    "the particle gains a tachyonic effective mass near its critical energy scale . compared with other scenarios of lorentz violation , a new feature here is the dependence on mass - energy ratio @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "the lorentz violation is mass - dependent in this scenario .",
    "more interestingly , for massless photons , relation reduces to the standard mass - energy relation if we promote velocity to momentum via @xmath29 .    based upon the nature of function @xmath24",
    ", this scenario can be divided into two branches . in the first branch ,",
    "@xmath24 is a universal function for all species of matter .",
    "both the form and parameters of this function are universal .",
    "then @xmath30 is a universal constant .",
    "we will use `` democratic models '' to name models in this branch and study them in sec .",
    "[ subsec : demo ] .",
    "models in the second branch will be dubbed `` discriminative models '' . in these models ,",
    "the exact form and parameters of function @xmath24 depend on species of matter .",
    "for instance , the function @xmath24 could involve charges and coupling constants of the particle .",
    "the discriminative models are investigated in sec .",
    "[ subsec : disc ] .",
    "most economically @xmath24 is a universal function for all species of matter irrespective of masses , flavors , charges , _",
    "etc_. then @xmath30 is approximated by a universal constant .",
    "assuming @xmath31 and the critical energy scale @xmath32 for neutrino , we get @xmath33 . for electron of mass @xmath34 , this yields a critical energy @xmath35 , a scale well above the cern lhc energy . for heavier particles ,",
    "the critical scale is even higher . in this perspective , the mass hierarchy of standard model particles is responsible for the energy hierarchy of lorentz - violating new physics . and quite fortunately , accelerator - generated neutrinos fall in such a weird `` new physics '' scale .",
    "the hierarchy also puts our scenario in safety .",
    "so far we have failed to find a counter example for this scenario .",
    "but it is believed that probably the scenario of this branch can be ruled out by a clever reasoning or by some data in the large body of experiments .",
    "lacking of a counter example temporarily , let us take a closer look at this scenario .",
    "to get some sense of it , we devised a toy model of three independent parameters @xmath36=\\delta\\times\\exp\\left[-\\epsilon\\left(\\frac{e_{\\c}^2}{e^2}+\\frac{e^2}{e_{\\c}^2}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ] setting @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - demo ] the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath6 .",
    "it agrees well with the observational constraints in table [ tab - nuspeed ] . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - demo ] , parameters @xmath42 ( or equivalently @xmath30 ) and @xmath43 dictate the location and width in energy for lorentz violation .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath24 or @xmath41 near @xmath44 is controlled by @xmath45 . here",
    "the values of parameters are put and tuned by hand .",
    "if there are more data points , we may numerically compute the best - fit values of parameters . as indicated by the smallness of @xmath45 and @xmath30",
    ", we need a fine - tuning of parameters in this toy model . in our scenario ,",
    "the fine - tuning problem arises from the energy scale and amplitude of lorentz violation .     given by the toy model .",
    "the model parameters are chosen as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it accommodates well the data listed in table [ tab - nuspeed].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    given by the toy model .",
    "the model parameters are chosen as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it accommodates well the data listed in table [ tab - nuspeed].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    the above toy model is helpful phenomenologically but useless in construction of a fundamental theory .",
    "although lorentz symmetry is broken at the critical scale , we expect a new symmetry will emerge hereabout .",
    "the expected new symmetry should be incorporated in the theory by devising a more elegant function @xmath24 .",
    "the physical origin of democratic models and new symmetry will be pondered over in sec . [",
    "sec : disc ] .",
    "a more flexible possibility is that the deformed mass - energy relation is not universal but varies from particle to particle .",
    "that is to say , function @xmath24 involves more parameters such as couplings , charges , _",
    "etc_. in particular , it is possible that @xmath46 for neutrinos but @xmath47 for other species of particles .",
    "the subindex implies the species - dependence .",
    "we feel that this class of models have more chances to survive than democratic models .",
    "to work with a concrete model , we return to the tachyonic neutrino with a running mass .",
    "other species are irrelevant in the present analysis , because @xmath48 for them can be tuned independently to comply with experiments .",
    "thus we concentrate on the neutrino sector and phenomenologically apply the toy model to it . after some calculation",
    ", we find this can be realized if the effective squared mass runs like @xmath49.\\ ] ] with parameters similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig - demo ] , this model fit well the given measurement results , as is depicted in fig . [ fig - disc ] .",
    "one may compute the running of squared mass for this model straightforwardly , which changes signature near @xmath50 . in model , @xmath51 crosses zero twice .",
    "the picture of this process was shot and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - disc ] .",
    "it indicates that as energy increases , the neutrino runs from an ordinary particle to a tachyonic particle for a while and then back to an ordinary particle .    , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is in agreement with our expectation in sec .",

    "in sec . [ sec : lv ] , we accommodated the neutrino velocity anomaly in the scenario of mass - dependent lorentz violation .",
    "but we did not explain the physical origins of such a behavior of lorentz violation , which remains an open problem . here",
    "are some thoughts on this problem .",
    "as we can expect , there are two possible origins .",
    "one is from the nature of spacetime .",
    "this happens in democratic models . in this case",
    ", we would have to ultimately replace the lorentz symmetry with some new symmetry , just like switching from galilean symmetry to lorentz symmetry .",
    "this will deform plane wave solutions and would potentially bring troubles to quantization .",
    "it reminds us of doubly special relativity @xcite , @xmath54-minkowski spacetime @xcite and very special relativity @xcite .",
    "the other origin is from the dynamics of matter fields , _",
    "e.g. _ the running of mass with energy .",
    "this happens in both democratic models and discriminative models . in this case",
    ", the lorentz symmetry is not broken for spacetime , but it is apparently broken for certain species of matter at special energy scales .",
    "the results in this paper are tentative rather than conclusive .",
    "first , our investigation has not exhausted all potential explanations for the superluminal propagation of neutrinos",
    ". there could be reasonable explanations making use of flavor dependence or time / century / baseline dependence of the data .",
    "they are out of the scope this work although we have highlighted these features in sec .",
    "[ sec : record ] .",
    "second , as we emphasized in the very beginning , before drawing a conclusion about fundamental theories , the most imperative thing is to further check the systematic errors in measurement .",
    "we are waiting for future news from experiments before polishing our models .",
    "when this work was near completion , related papers @xcite appeared , also tackling with the issues of neutrino velocity data in table [ tab - nuspeed ] .",
