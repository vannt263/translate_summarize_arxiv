    "on 2011 march 28 , the _ swift _  satellite @xcite triggered on a new source , swift  j164449.3 + 573451 ( swiftj1644 + 57  hereafter ) . swiftj1644 + 57  triggered the _",

    "* hereafter ) found that the host extinction was @xmath2 , which led to a positive slope of the intrinsic spectrum in the optical band and our conclusion that the optical and x - ray bands were both part of the same synchrotron component .",
    "this interpretation required that the radio emission originate in a different emission region , which we proposed was in the external shock . @xcite and @xcite came to similar conclusions , based on their radio observations .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , concluded that the radio and nir / optical emission originated in the same synchrotron component .",
    "prior to the discovery of swiftj1644 + 57 , relativistic jets created by tidal disruption around dormant black holes ( bhs ) had only rarely been discussed in the literature on tde theory ( e.g. , @xcite ; cf .",
    "these earlier works generally considered scenarios in which a solar mass star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , roughly half of the stellar mass is captured with the remainder of the disrupted star ejected into hyperbolic orbits , and visible , uv , and x - ray flares are produced by the impulsive compression of the star , the resulting accretion disk , and/or the outflowing material .",
    "in retrospect , it is not surprising that a jet could be formed in a tde , as the smbhs in an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) produce jets under conditions of ongoing accretion .",
    "the unique aspect of this discovery was the detailed observation in the x - ray band of the turn - on of a jet in a previously dormant smbh .",
    "the discovery of this event produced a flurry of publications providing interpretation of the data . while most authors ( including ) argued for a solar mass star being tidally disrupted by a smbh , @xcite preferred a white dwarf being disrupted by an intermediate mass bh in order to explain the rapid time variability .",
    "@xcite suggested that the star was on an orbit with a very small impact parameter , and the resulting plunge deep into the smbh potential well totally disrupted the star , which was then completely swallowed by the bh .",
    "the purpose of the present work is the complete analysis of the _ swift_/xrt follow - up data of swiftj1644 + 57  from the beginning to the end of the outburst , which occurred on 2012 august 17th , 507 days after the initial bat trigger , and the following monitoring observations by _ swift_/xrt and /acis .",

    "we discuss our results and their implications in the context of tidal disruption models of a star by a smbh associated to relativistic jet ejection .",

    "results are presented and discussed in section [ subsec : residual ] .      the 0.3@xmath1310 kev count rate light curve shown in figure  [ fig : xrt_lc ]",
    "was produced by binning the net source counts in order to have at least 200 counts per time bin at early times , and progressively decreasing the level of required counts per bin down to at least 10 counts per bin at late times , up to sequence 00032526001 , observed on 2012 august 16 , 507 days after the trigger . on day 508",
    "the source emission suddenly dropped below the detection threshold for a 1@xmath132 ks single snapshot observation @xcite .",
    "a detailed plot of the abrupt drop is shown in figure  [ fig : aug - sept ] , where data from 2012 august and september have been binned daily . the daily count rate measured in the source region ( red histogram )",

    "when swiftj1644 + 57  is not detected , the 3@xmath3 upper limit on source count rate is shown .",
    "the plot shows that the count rate drops abruptly on day 508 ( 2012 august 17 ) . by comparing the count rate on day 507 and the level of the deepest upper limit we see in figure  [ fig : aug - sept ] ( on day 537 ) we can state that we had a drop of more than a factor 11 in one month , i.e. a fraction of 0.06 of the total time elapsed .    the very last point in the light curve of figure  [ fig : xrt_lc ]",
    "is the detection obtained from the summed 191 monitoring observations performed from 2012 august 17th ( marked by the green dashed vertical line ) to 2014 march 28th , for a total of 284.5 ks exposure .",
    "we extracted the source counts from a circular region of 10 pixels radius ( 314 pixel@xmath17 area ) and estimated the background contribution from counts found in the background region ( 21,143 pixel@xmath17 area , specifically selected to avoid contamination from any field source detected in the whole pc data set ) and rescaled to the source region area .",
    "we obtained 78 total counts in the source region in the 0.3@xmath1310 kev band with an estimated background of 44 counts and applied the technique of @xcite to calculate the upper and lower 99% confidence limits on source counts .",
    "these correspond to an average count rate of @xmath18  s@xmath9 .",
    "the source is also detected on the summed image of the post - drop monitoring with the ximage command sosta , centered on the position of source with user defined source and background regions , at the level @xmath19  s@xmath9 with 3.8@xmath3 significance .",
    "the band ratio and hardness ratio curves of swiftj1644 + 57  are shown in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "we have defined the energy range 0.3@xmath131.5 kev as the soft band ( s ) and the energy range 1.5@xmath1310 kev as the hard band ( h ) .",
    "we have calculated both the ratio of the counts detected in the two bands ( h / s ) and the hardness ratio ( h - s)/(h+s ) .",
    "the curves have been binned in order to have at least 500 net counts in each band up to day 507 post - trigger . for the last point ( covering the time interval from day 508 to day 1096 ) net counts in the required bands",
    "were derived from the summed post - drop observations with the same procedure used for the count rate light curve .",
    "errors have been estimated in the poisson approximation @xcite and propagated with standard error propagation formulae . at the beginning ,",
    "both curves show variations tracking the light curve flares , with the hardness rising when the average rate increases , and decaying when the average rate decreases .",
    "but later phases with different trends can be identified .",
    "we observe a hardness plateau phase from @xmath122.4 to @xmath1216 days post - trigger , corresponding to a phase of average rate decrease ( from @xmath122.4 to @xmath126 days ) followed by a rapid rise by a factor @xmath1210 in @xmath120.3 days and a shallow decay afterwards . after 16 days , while the average rate in the light curve goes on decaying steadily , we observe a relatively rapid ( @xmath121 day long ) drop ( i.e. softening ) in the hardness followed by a steep rising ( i.e. hardening ) phase that lasts up to @xmath12100 days , when a final hardness plateau phase starts . in both cases",
    "the last point represents a clearly different and much softer spectral state compared to the final trend of the curve .",
    "a comparable softness is attained only at a few light curve minima between flares ( e.g. the first one at @xmath120.2 days ) , which are minima for the band ratio and hardness ratio curves as well .",
    "if the abrupt swiftj1644 + 57  emission drop on day 508 is due to the turn - off of the jet @xcite , which might be likely caused by a transition to a thin disk as the accretion rate dropped below a critical value of several tens of percent of the eddington accretion rate @xcite , then the low - level residual emission we detected later should have a different origin and this discontinuity in the hardness curves would not be surprising .",
    "we see evidence of different spectral phases during swiftj1644 + 57   evolution also in figure  [ fig : hrvsrate ] , where the soft band ratio s/(h+s ) is plotted against the total rate ( h+s ) in the 0.3@xmath1310 kev band . here",
    "xrt data in different operation mode are color - coded as in the previous figures , and different markers distinguish early emission ( before 2.4 days , filled circles ) from intermediate ( between 2.4 and 39 days , empty stars ) and late emission ( after 39 days , empty triangles ) . according to this plot",
    "early data show an anti - correlation between the soft band ratio and the overall count rate i.e. a trend for harder spectra at higher rates . the correlation is tighter for wt data .",
    "pc data are more dispersed and seem to lie on a different correlation , also consistent with the harder - when - brighter trend .",
    "late data are in pc mode only , and follow an opposite trend of harder spectra at lower rates despite the large dispersion .",
    "intermediate data populate the central part of the plot .",
    "part of these ( wt data up to 23 days , dark blue empty stars ) were included in the corresponding plot in ( supplementary figure 4 ) and are interpreted as a second branch of the wt harder - when - brighter correlation after a count - rate discontinuity at @xmath124  s@xmath9 .",
    "the inclusion of the remaining wt data ( light blue empty stars ) has not completed the correlation in the left upward direction as expected , but simply thickened the data cloud on the left direction .",
    "note that count rates as low as those reached by the wt data in figure  [ fig : xrt_lc ] are not seen in this plot because of the different binning criterion used .",
    "the intermediate pc data populate the bottom of the central cloud , spanning a range in rates comparable to the intermediate wt data , but with much less spread in softness ( consistent with the plateau observed in figure  [ fig : hr ] between 2.4 and 16 days ) . with the possible exception of intermediate pc data , intermediate wt and late pc data in figure  [ fig : hrvsrate ]",
    "may be interpreted as a single component obtained by shifting leftwards and downwards with time an anti - correlation law similar to the one followed by the early wt data .",
    "this result could be obtained with a global hardening with time superimposed on a strict hardness - tracking - brightness rule on the smaller variability timescales of flares and dips .",
    "the xrt team s on - line light curve repository ( http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/00450158/ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) uses a single conversion factor between count rate and flux ( ecf ) , determined using an automated spectral fit of the pc mode data .",
    "this works well for grbs , since there is rarely any significant spectral evolution after the first few ks of the afterglow , but it does not work well for swiftj1644 + 57 , due to the extremely strong spectral variations during the first few hundred days ( figure  [ fig : hr ] ) . a more realistic conversion to flux",
    "can be obtained via time - dependent spectral analysis .",
    "the procedure , which we already applied in , consists of the following steps : _",
    "i ) _ split the data set into a sequence of short time intervals tracking the hardness states of the source but with enough counting statistics to use standard @xmath16 fitting techniques , and extract spectra for each time interval ; _ ii ) _ fit each spectrum , derive the ecf corresponding to the best - fit model , and create a stepped ecf evolution law ; _ iii ) _ convert the count rate light curve to flux by applying at each point an ecf obtained through a cubic spline interpolation of the ecf stepped curve .",
    "the conversion applied in was limited to the first 50 days of the swiftj1644 + 57  outburst , and was based on spectral modeling with the log - parabola model defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the photon index and @xmath22 is a measure of the curvature compared to a simple power law , which is obtained for @xmath23 .",
    "the complete spectral model we use also includes two absorption components : a galactic one with @xmath24 fixed to 1.7 @xmath25 10@xmath26 @xmath27 @xcite and an intrinsic one at redshift @xmath28 = 0.35 with allowed to vary with time .",
    "the log - parabola model has been introduced as a good empirical fit for broadband spectral distributions of bl lacs and other blazar sources .",
    "the version we use corresponds to the model logpar in xspec @xcite with ( constant ) parameter pivot-@xmath29 ( representing the low end of the energy range used in the fit ) fixed to 1 kev , and curvature parameter equal to @xmath30 . in",
    "we reported that the log - parabola spectral model generally provided better fits than a simple power law to both time and intensity - selected spectra of swiftj1644 + 57 , though power - law fits were statistically acceptable .",
    "however , in about 74% of cases the best - fit value of the parameter @xmath22 was consistent with zero within its uncertainties , making the model perfectly equivalent to a power law ( see supplementary figure  11 in ) , but with substantially larger errors on both the intrinsic absorption column and the photon index compared to the power - law fit .    for the present paper",
    ", we complete the set of time - dependent spectra used in with more spectra extracted from the data collected after the first 50 days and before the light curve drop , reaching a total of 215 spectra ( 163 in wt mode and 52 in pc mode ) .",
    "we have reanalyzed the whole data set with updated spectral response files , fitting each spectrum with both power - law and log - parabola models .",
    "since these two models are suitable for an f - test @xcite , we apply it to estimate the probability p of chance improvement of the @xmath16 and reject all the log - parabola fits with p @xmath31 0.01 .",
    "this condition rejects 195 of the log - parabola fits ( including all the best - fit solutions with @xmath22 consistent with zero within errors ) i.e. , according to this selection the log - parabola model significantly improves the fit only for 20 spectra ( 15 in wt mode and 5 in pc mode ) .",
    "thus , for every further calculation , we decided to use the power - law fit results for all the spectra but the 20 for which the log - parabola fit represents a significant improvement .",
    "we also extracted and analyzed a spectrum from the summed pc data collected after the drop in the light curve , choosing source and background extraction regions as we did for the final count rate and hardness ratio calculation . in this case",
    "the data were binned to 1 count per energy bin to allow for fitting with cash statistics @xcite in xspec ( with @xmath16 statistic test evaluation enabled ) .",
    "the very low statistics do not allow for a fit with an absorbed power - law with both intrinsic  and photon index free or an absorbed log - parabola model in this case .",
    "we modeled the spectrum with an absorbed power - law with intrinsic  fixed to 1.9 @xmath25 10@xmath32 @xmath27 .",
    "the best fit photon index is @xmath33 .",
    "the fit is poor and the uncertainty is very large .",
    "@xmath34 values larger than 2 are likely to be preferred because corresponding models give h / s @xmath15 1.5 . the correct band ratio may be achieved also with @xmath34 values smaller than 2 and lower intrinsic .",
    "we then performed a second fit with @xmath34 fixed to 1 and free intrinsic .",
    "the fit is apparently equivalent to the previous one and formally gives  @xmath35 @xmath25 10@xmath32 @xmath27 , but the model can not reproduce an @xmath361 unless  is zero",

    "these different behaviors are visible in figure  [ fig : parvsflux ] , where the photon indices and the intrinsic absorption columns of the time - resolved spectra of swiftj1644 + 57  well fit by an absorbed power - law model are plotted as a function of the 2@xmath1310 kev flux . the photon index plot ( left panel )",

    "as illustrated by grb060729 , grb afterglows are typically fairly smooth ; they may show flares ( usually in the first day , before and/or during the plateau phase ) but never show dips , nor has a grb ever exhibited a range of variability like that seen in swiftj1644 + 57 , which uniformly spans more than one order of magnitude throughout its evolution .",
    "moreover , grb afterglows rarely exhibit spectral evolution after the first day , while we have shown that swiftj1644 + 57  exhibits strong spectral evolution for well over a year .",

    "_ ( 3 ) _ we calculated the mean and sample variance of the six values of @xmath67 obtained in _ ( 2 ) _ and used the result as a measure of the average slope of the flux light curve in the 6@xmath13508 days time interval .",
    "we obtained a final decay slope of @xmath68 .",
    "we checked the effect on the average decay slope of our time - dependent flux conversion by applying the same procedure ( steps 1 , 2 , and 3 above ) to an unabsorbed flux light curve obtained with a uniform conversion factor and to the flux light curve in the on - line repository as well .",
    "we obtained values for the average decay slope in the 6@xmath13508 days time interval of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "both values are consistent within the errors with @xmath68 .",
    "this suggests that our time - dependent conversion to unabsorbed flux does not affect the average decay slope of the light curve , though enhancing dispersion .",

    "the degeneracy between decay steepness @xmath67 and @xmath76 revealed in figure  [ fig : slope - offset ] can be quantitatively resolved by considering the form of the decay law , and the basic properties of the tde decay .",
    "after a tde occurs , there is negligible accretion from stellar fallback for @xmath12@xmath80 , the fallback time for the most tightly bound debris to return to the bh and to begin to accrete .",
    "@xcite suggest that following @xmath80 there may elapse an additional @xmath76 for magnetic flux accumulation in the inner disk to build up to the point that the jet becomes active .",

    "the smooth power - law decay trend observed in the late xrt light curve supports the idea of a simple linear relation between @xmath86 and @xmath87 out to @xmath89 days .    by considering the ratio of the peak x - ray flux to the fluence @xmath90 where @xmath91 , one can directly measure @xmath92 @xcite . from the functional form for @xmath93",

    "these small values of @xmath101 days argue against the possibility for @xmath102 days presented in @xcite . for this estimate",
    "we have idealized the entire light curve with one decay law .",
    "one could in theory fit a broken power law and obtain a more precise estimate , but given that @xmath103 is set by a flare during the first few days , only a rough estimate seems warranted .",
    "clues about the physical nature of swiftj1644 + 57   may come from the difference in the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted by the source during the dips and outside them .",
    "since dips are short and often drop more than an order of magnitude from the average emission level , we can not obtain sufficient counts for detailed spectral analysis of individual dips . instead",
    ", we must extract a single cumulative spectrum from many dips at a time . on the other hand",
    ", we can not merge data from different operation modes .",
    "therefore , we consider the following two different periods during which significantly deep dips are visible in the light curve of swiftj1644 + 57 : _ ( a ) _ from @xmath6 + 14.5 days to @xmath6 + 39.5 , with xrt steadily observing in wt mode and _ ( b ) _ from @xmath6 + 40.5 days to @xmath6 + 404.8 with xrt steadily observing in pc mode .",
    "to select the dip good time intervals ( gtis ) , we developed a three step procedure that can be described as follows : _",
    "( i ) _ fit the light curve in a given time interval to a model and calculate the weighted residuals ; _",
    "( ii ) _ remove all points with weighted residuals lower than a fixed negative threshold , then repeat the fit until no further points need to be removed ; _ ( iii ) _ shift the best - fit model down by a proper amount and save as gtis of the dips all the time intervals including only points below the shifted model .",
    "we developed this procedure in the idl programming language and making use of the fit routines in the mpfit package by @xcite .",
    "step _ ( ii ) _ in our procedure gives us an alternative way to estimate the continuum underlying the light curve , though because of the large dispersion of the data the reduced @xmath16 of the fit is not expected to assume statistically acceptable values , and the uncertainties of the model parameters are expected to be substantially underestimated .",
    "the dips represent the points with the largest deviation from the continuum and they dominate the residuals : best - fit solutions obtained without removing any point have normalizations that make them lie significantly below the bulk of the data set .",
    "the iterative removal of points with negative residuals allows us to obtain solutions that actually pass through the most densely populated region of the curve .",
    "a threshold of @xmath104 for the weighted residuals has been chosen in order to obtain a good description of the flux light curve after 6 days , using a power - law model @xmath105 with decay slope @xmath67 fixed to the value of @xmath106 estimated in section [ sec : lcfit ] . in figure  [ fig : lcfit ] , the model just described is represented by the black solid line in the upper panel , and the weighted residuals in the lower panel refer to it .",

    "an alternate interpretation is that the residual x - ray emission detected by  and _ swift _  after jet shut - off originates from the forward shock of the jet still expanding in the ambient medium .",
    "in fact , @xcite calculate that the low x - ray flux measured by   is consistent with synchrotron emission from the forward shock of a structured jet with time - dependent physical parameters derived by modeling the radio spectra of swiftj1644 + 57 , which they regularly monitored for about 600 days after the outburst . in this scenario",

    "since the @xcite analysis shows that the cooling frequency of the shocked electrons was and is likely still expected to be in the infrared band , the spectral slope in x - rays should be @xmath212 , and for a typical value of @xmath207 , we expect @xmath213 @xcite . unfortunately , none of our _ swift _  or  x - ray spectra has enough statistics to unambiguously constrain the photon index .",

    "the uncertainty regarding the long term evolution of the whole system after jet shut - off , the nature and timescales of possible future disk transitions and their observable signatures are related to the uncertainty in the physics of disk accretion and to the detailed accretion disk models adopted by different authors . according to @xcite a reactivation of the jet",

    "swift_. in the final analysis , such questions will be decided by observations , and to this end _ swift",
    "_  continues to observe swiftj1644 + 57  regularly , watching for another flare - up of this fascinating object .",
    "we have shown that the shape and the variability timescales in the x - ray light curve of swiftj1644 + 57  are unlike other known sources with relativistic jets along the line of sight .",
    "the spectral behavior of swiftj1644 + 57  is peculiar as well .",
    "for the first several days the source seems to follow a pure harder - when - brighter correlation similar to that observed in blazars , but the later time analysis we have done can be better explained in terms of a superposition of a slow hardening of the spectra along with the global light curve decay , and a harder - when - brighter correlation tracking variability at shorter timescales . the typical harder - when - brighter behavior in blazar flares",
    "can be explained in terms of the blazar spectral model @xcite by a rise of the external compton ( ec ) component with the accretion rate , associated with an independent different evolution of the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) component .",
    "it has also been observed that the slope of the correlation between the photon index and the 2@xmath1310  kev flux can be different from flare to flare , and can even disappear @xcite .",
    "this may happen when the scc and ec components increase proportionally with the accretion rate but maintain balance , so that luminosity rises achromatically .",
    "successfully explained the early broadband spectra of swiftj1644 + 57with a blazar - like spectral model , but no ec component was required by our data .",
    "the stringent veritas and _ fermi _ upper limits on gamma - ray emission even required a suppression of the self compton peak of the spectrum through pair production .",
    "the ec component in blazars can be produced by seed photons from the broad line region ( blr ) and/or seed photons from the accretion disk interacting with the relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "actually , it is very unlikely that a blr had time enough to form in the case of swiftj1644 + 57 , but it is still possible that ec from disk photons contributes to the soft x - ray emission of swiftj1644 + 57 , though the component peak , expected at very high energies , must be highly suppressed . on the other hand , ( e.g. supplementary figure  15 ) showed that both the xrt spectrum extracted at the light curve minimum 4.5 days post - trigger and the later intermediate level spectrum extracted at 8 days post - trigger have an upward kink at higher energies that suggest the presence of an unknown additional hard spectral component , the peak of which they could not constrain .",
    "this is also the case for all our xrt spectra fit by a concave log - parabola model .",
    "this unknown hard component may play a role similar to the low energy tail of the ec in determining the spectral evolution of swiftj1644 + 57 in x - rays .",
    "the softness of the average emission of the dips compared to the inter - dip normal emission , without  variation , agrees with a production mechanism based on a larger contribution of a hard spectral component at larger accretion rate / luminosity .",
    "the apparent randomness in temporal distribution , duration , and depths of the dips , as well as in height , duration , and structure of the flares occurring between dips , suggest they originate from random fluctuations in the accretion rate , i.e. instabilities in the accretion flow , like in blazars",
    ". however , dynamic range and duty cycle of dips and flares in swiftj1644 + 57  are extreme compared to blazars , and are difficult to reproduce in this model .",
    "@xcite suggest that the required extremely compact and short - lived inhomogeneities ( i.e. `` knots '' ) in the accretion flow , can be obtained if the tidally disrupted star is a white dwarf and the tidal disruption goes on taking away fragments of it at each periastron passage until it is consumed .",
    "however , only a central bh mass of @xmath1210@xmath219 m@xmath220 would fit the observed timescales , which is not consistent with results from our analysis of the global decay of the swiftj1644 + 57   light curve .",
    "an alternative mechamism based on random internal shocks propagating along the jet channel has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "based on a hint of possible periodic modulation of the dips , @xcite proposed they may be due to combined effects of precession and nutation that cause the core of the jet briefly to go out of the line of sight .",
    "we present the definitive _",
    "swift_/xrt light curve for swiftj1644 + 57 , which spans @xmath12800 days .",
    "we find that the ecf varies over time due to spectral evolution .",
    "most previous studies of the long term swiftj1644 + 57 relied on a single ecf for the entire light curve .",
    "the peak flux , at @xmath221 days , was @xmath222 erg @xmath27 s@xmath9 , and the fluence over the entire light curve was @xmath223 erg @xmath27 . with the standard cosmology , a redshift @xmath224 yields peak luminosity and total energy values of @xmath225 erg s@xmath9 and @xmath226 erg , respectively . from the ratio of these numbers we determine an observationally based value for the fallback time for debris following the tde of @xmath163 days . by fitting the decay slope for 6 days @xmath227 508 days for six logarithmic binnings in @xmath228 we determine a post - fluctuation decay slope @xmath229 .",
    "this is statistically distinguishable from the @xmath98 value for swiftj1644 + 57 commonly cited in the literature , and also from the @xmath100 value advocated by @xcite and @xcite wherein one has a rapid transition from stellar fallback to highly advective disk accretion .",
    "given the large fluctuations in x - ray flux with time , it may be difficult even with our multi - time step averaging technique to reliably extract a physically meaningful slope which bears comparison to theory .",
    "previous studies quoting a slope did not carry out detailed fitting but simply overlay a @xmath98 decay onto @xmath230 light curve for swiftj1644 + 57  taken from the _ swift_/xrt website , which assumes a single ecf value .",
    "our small inferred @xmath80 supports the viewpoint of a rapid transition from stellar fallback to disk accretion @xcite but the value of @xmath231 does not . a value @xmath232 1 day challenges current theory , which favors @xmath233 days , but does not consider strong general relativistic effects in the kerr metric for large @xmath234 encounters ; modifications in the binding energy spread @xmath172 for the tidal debris from the standard results for @xmath165 encounters are treated via linear perturbations to a newtonian gravitational potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite carry out simplified monte carlo realizations of tidal disruption streams to determine their structure prior to circularization .",
    "they find that for smbhs with @xmath240 the stream self - intersection happens after the most bound debris has wound around periapse many times , and thus one expects the accretion rate onto the bh to be delayed with respect to the fallback rate , @xmath241 .",
    "this delay would occur in addition to the one posited by @xcite by considering magnetic flux build - up near the bh .",
    "the results of @xcite are particularly interesting in light of our observational result @xmath242 day and indicate that additional physical effects may be required to address the unique aspects of swiftj1644 + 57 .",
    "we can not favor an interpretation of the late time low - level x - ray emission by  and _ swift _  as being consistent with emission from the forward shock of a structured jet because the second  observation performed at the beginning of 2015 shows that the x - ray flux has not decayed as expected in this scenario from an extrapolation of the radio decay trend . however , further coordinated x - ray and radio monitoring of the source is needed to rule out the suggested common origin of the residual x - rays and the radio emission .",
