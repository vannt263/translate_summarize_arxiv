    "kilowatt signal power levels have been achieved in yb@xmath0-doped fiber amplifiers operating near 1.0  @xmath1 m and in tm@xmath0-doped fiber amplifiers operating near 2.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "one obstacle encountered in attempting to scale single - transverse - mode outputs from yb - doped fibers to still higher powers is a thermally induced mode instability@xcite .",
    "such mode instability has not yet been reported for tm - doped fiber . however , considering its thermal origin and the fact that the heat deposited in tm - doped fiber is more than three times higher than in yb - doped fiber , an important question is whether such instability is expected for 790  nm pumped tm - doped fiber amplifiers , and if so , at what threshold power . in earlier reports we developed a model of stimulated thermal rayleigh scattering ( strs ) to explain mode instability in yb - doped fiber amplifiers@xcite .",
    "here we extend our strs model to tm - doped fiber to confirm the likelihood of mode instability and to predict threshold signal powers .",
    "thulium - doped amplifiers have several attractions . like yb - doped fibers , they are broadly tunable so they support ultra short pulse amplification .",
    "atmospheric transmission is good near 2040  nm where these fibers operate well at high power .",
    "their relatively long signal wavelength makes it easier to design fibers with large mode area , leading to better suppression of stimulated brillouin scatter ( sbs ) .",
    "the sbs linewidth is reduced by approximately four relative to a yb - doped fiber , so suppression by temperature tuning the sbs stokes shift or broadening the signal linewidth are also more effective than in yb - doped fibers@xcite .",
    "the longer signal wavelength also means the self focusing power limit , which is proportional to ( @xmath3 ) , is approximately four times higher than in yb - doped fiber .",
    "additionally , the pump absorption band at 790  nm enables pumping by high power , high efficiency algaas pump lasers .",
    "high power tm amplifiers pumped at 790  nm have been demonstrated by ehrenreich _",
    "et al._@xcite who achieved 1 kw at 2045  nm in a 12 m long 20:400 ( core : pump cladding diameters ) tm - doped silicate fiber with numerical aperture ( na ) of 0.08 ( v=3.1 ) .",
    "their slope efficiency was 53% .",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated 608  w at 2040  nm , pumping with 790  nm light , to achieve 54% power efficiency in 3.1  m of 25:400 fiber .",
    "high beam quality was demonstrated by their @xmath4 value of 1.05 .",
    "further , the phase stability of high power tm - doped fibers was shown to be good enough for efficient coherent beam combining of multiple fiber outputs@xcite . however , the best power efficiency of tm - doped amplifiers is only about 60% , in contrast to 90% for yb",
    "- doped fiber pumped at 976  nm .",
    "first , we offer a brief review of the physics included in our model of strs in fiber amplifiers .",
    "mode instability is the degradation of output beam quality above a sharp power threshold@xcite .",
    "assuming most of the signal seed light is injected into the fundamental transverse mode lp@xmath5 , below threshold the output remains mostly in lp@xmath5 . above threshold",
    "a substantial fraction occupies higher order modes , especially lp@xmath6 .",
    "because different transverse modes have different propagation constants , these two modes interfere to create a signal irradiance pattern that oscillates side - to - side along the length of the fiber .",
    "pump light is preferentially absorbed in regions of higher signal irradiance where the population inversion is lower , and because a certain fraction of the absorbed pump is converted to heat , this creates a heating pattern that resembles the irradiance pattern .",
    "the heat pattern is converted to a similar temperature pattern , and the temperature pattern creates a refractive index pattern via the thermo - optic effect . if the interference pattern is stationary , there is little or no phase shift between the thermally - induced index pattern and the irradiance pattern , resulting in nearly zero net transfer of power between modes .",
    "however , if the light in the higher order mode is slightly detuned in frequency from lp@xmath5 , the irradiance pattern moves along the fiber - downstream for a red detuning and upstream for a blue detuning .",
    "the temperature pattern also moves but lags the irradiance pattern due to thermal diffusion .",
    "this lag produces the phase shift necessary to induce power transfer between modes .",
    "red detuning of lp@xmath6 leads to power transfer from lp@xmath5 to lp@xmath6 .",
    "when light in lp@xmath5 is transferred to lp@xmath6 by the moving grating it experiences a frequency shift equal to the modal frequency offset due to a doppler effect@xcite , so the transferred light adds coherently to the light already in lp@xmath6 .",
    "the resulting exponential gain process can be categorized as near - forward stimulated thermal rayleigh scattering .",
    "the frequency offset that maximizes the mode coupling is approximately the inverse of the thermal diffusion time across the fiber core .",
    "diffusion times are approximately 0.1 - 1 ms , implying frequency detunings of approximately 1 - 10 khz .",
    "our approach to modeling strs is to develop the most general numerical model feasible .",
    "it includes all the physical effects just described@xcite .",
    "we use diffractive beam propagation of a time - periodic signal field .",
    "this field incorporates all transverse fiber modes ( including lossy modes ) and can include all offset frequencies that are harmonics of a selected principal offset frequency .",
    "all modes are assumed to have the same polarization .",
    "the time - dependent temperature profile is computed using a steady - periodic green s function method@xcite .",
    "mode coupling occurs through inclusion of the thermally - induced change in the transverse refractive index profile used to compute the beam propagation .",
    "no analytic or semi - analytic expressions of mode coupling are needed , and coupling between all modes is included .",
    "we use this approach because it permits the most accurate modeling , and because it makes inclusion of various additional physical effects relatively straightforward .",
    "the cost of such a general numerical model is long run - times , but using the methods described in ref .",
    "@xcite we can model a few meters of fiber per hour on a consumer grade desktop computer . in the model results presented here we ignore pump and signal losses due to scattering or photodarkening , temperature dependence of the tm ion absorption and emission cross - sections and the ion decay rates , and practical issues such as melting the fiber outer cladding .",
    "alternative strs models based on mode coupling theory have been published by other authors@xcite but we will not review them here . an alternative beam propagation model that includes the same physics as ours but without the assumption of periodic behavior has also been developed@xcite .    in comparing strs gain in yb- and tm - doped fibers several factors must be considered .",
    "the first is the influence of the nearly doubled signal wavelengths in tm - doped fiber .",
    "another is the more complex process of heat generation in tm - doped fiber . in yb - doped fiber approximately 10% of the absorbed pump light",
    "is converted to heat .",
    "if each pump photon creates one signal photon then the heat is the difference in photon energies of ( @xmath7 $ ] ) which is about 10% of @xmath8 . in tm - doped fiber",
    "if one pump photon created one signal photon then the heat would be approximately 60% of @xmath8 assuming 790  nm pump and 2040  nm signal , limiting the power efficiency to around 40% .",
    "measured power efficiencies are greater than 60% , however , and this is attributed to a cross - relaxation process .",
    "clearly this process must be included in an accurate tm - doped fiber amplifier strs model .",
    "as is true for yb - doped fiber , population saturation has a strong impact on strs thresholds in tm - doped fiber .",
    "population saturation leads to transverse heat profiles which more closely resemble a tophat than the fundamental mode signal irradiance which resembles a gaussian .",
    "this reduces the antisymmetric part of the heat and pushes it toward the outer edge of the doped region .",
    "the result is reduced strs coupling strength@xcite .",
    "the energy level diagram for tm@xmath0 in silicate glass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.tm_levels ]",
    ". we will refer to the levels by number : @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; @xmath12 .",
    "we consider only 790  nm pumping and 2040  nm lasing .",
    "level 4 is directly populated via pump absorption by level-1 ions , and gain occurs via stimulated emission from level 2 to level 1 .",
    "one of the attractions of 790  nm pumping is a cross - relaxation process that combines a level-4 ion with a level-1 ion to produce two level-2 ions .",
    "this two - for - one process produces two ions in the upper laser level from the absorption of a single pump photon , and this allows the quantum efficiency to exceed unity .",
    "measured power efficiencies exceeding 60% have been demonstrated even though unit quantum efficiency corresponds to roughly 40% power efficiency .",
    "for the cross - relaxation process to compete with nonradiative decay of the level-4 ions , the doping concentration of tm ions should exceed the 2% doping limit of silica . therefore , tm - doped fibers are usually based on silicate glass with several percent al doping .",
    "the concentration of tm can then be as high as 7% , although 4 - 6% seems to be the most common level@xcite .     in silicate glass .",

    "<S> we use a detailed numerical model of stimulated thermal rayleigh scattering to compute mode instability thresholds in tm@xmath0-doped fiber amplifiers . </S>",
    "<S> the fiber amplifies 2040  nm light using a 790  nm pump . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - relaxation process is strong , permitting power efficiencies of 60% . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted instability thresholds are compared with those in similar yb@xmath0-doped fiber amplifiers with 976  nm pump and 1060  nm signal , and are found to be higher , even though the heat load is much higher in tm - doped amplifiers . </S>",
    "<S> the higher threshold in the tm - doped fiber is attributed to its longer signal wavelength , and to stronger gain saturation , due in part to cross - relaxation heating .    </S>",
