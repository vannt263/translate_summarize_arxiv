    "when considering the antiferromagnetic state , one usually refers to a model of two interpenetrating equivalent sublattices .",
    "the total lattice is in a state with zero @xmath1-projection of the total spin , whereas each sublattice is in a state with maximum spin , the @xmath1-projection of one sublattice being maximum and the other being minimum .",
    "this state is known as the neel state .",
    "the neel state attracts with it s simplicity and clearness . however , its quantum - mechanical realization and generation of the corresponding hamiltonians encounter serious problems . for one , the neel state wave function is not an eigenfunction of the system s total spin @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the non - degenerate eigenstate of any hamiltonian , which describes a system with definite total spin , is not the neel state .",
    "therefore , considering various antiferromagnetic models one usually uses hamiltonians with indefinite total spin  @xmath3 . at the same time , if a hamiltonian with definite total spin has degenerate spectrum the neel or neel - like states could be hidden in the degenerate level functional subspace . however , the structure of feasible hamiltonians with degenerate spectrum is not at all evident and it is a problem not only to extract the given state from the functional subspace but even to recognize whether the state is a member of the functional manifold .",
    "the approach adopted in the present paper is not to consider the hamiltonian eigenstates and compare them to the neel state , but to investigate governed by the hamiltonian time evolution of the neel state .",
    "the hamiltonians where the neel or neel - like state is either stationary or has a long lifetime can be considered as describing the antiferromagnetic systems .",
    "the quasionedimentional spin chain is considered in the paper .",
    "first , the pure spin states of the chain are discussed , the main attention being paid to the states with the maximum spin of each sublattice .",
    "it is shown in the paper that the neel state can be expressed as the particular linear combination of such states and the explicit equations for the linear combination coefficients are presented .",
    "in addition to the pure neel state various neel - like states are also considered in this section .    in subsequent sections the neel state s time evolution",
    "is investigated with the help of fock - krylov method  @xcite .",
    "various spin - model hamiltonians are employed here . among them",
    "are the well - known ones ( heisenberg model , ising model , xxz - model ) , and several new models with the degenerate ground state .",
    "the influence of the degeneracy on the neel state s time evolution is examined .",
    "finally the separable potential  @xcite was employed to obtain models with the neel state as the ground non - degenerate state .",
    "the spin chain s states with definite total spin and maximum spins of each sublattice are considered .",
    "it is shown , that particular linear combinations of these states possess some of the neel state s properties and , therefore , can be considered as a neel - like state .",
    "one such combination is the neel state itself .",
    "consider a quasionedimentional spin chain consisting of even number @xmath4 of @xmath5 spins @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( atomic units are used throughout the paper ) .",
    "the chain is divided into two sublattices , designated by the index @xmath8 .",
    "the first sublattice ( @xmath9 ) comprises spins with odd numbers , the second sublattice ( @xmath10 ) comprises spins with even numbers .",
    "the spin operators for both sublattices are    @xmath11    because operators @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 commute with each other , they have a common set of orthonormalized eigenfunctions @xmath16 .",
    "consider particular eigenfunctions @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is in the range @xmath19 $ ] , @xmath20 , and sublattices spins have maximum value @xmath21 .",
    "there exists only one ( apart from the phase factor ) function @xmath22 for each @xmath18 .",
    "it can be seen from the momenta coupling rule    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a clebsch - gordan coefficient , @xmath25 is @xmath8-th sublattice spin @xmath1-projection and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are normalized to unity functions of the first and the second sublattices correspondingly ( the conventional phase factor  @xcite is used in the present paper ) . for any @xmath28 there exist only one function @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the only possibility to obtain another function is to couple @xmath30 and @xmath31 in reverse order , but , according to the properties of the clebsch - gordan coefficients , this can change only the phase of the function @xmath22 .",
    "thus , there are only @xmath32 functions with a definite total spin and maximum values of sublattices spins .    in what follows we will consider a normalized to unity linear combinations of functions @xmath22",
    "@xmath33    it will be shown , that the particular set of the coefficients @xmath34 yields the wave function corresponding to the neel state .",
    "besides , the set of coefficients can be found to produce a neel - like state , i.e. the state which is not exactly the neel state but has properties similar to those of the neel state .",
    "these properties are : ( i ) a total chain s magnetization is equal to zero , while sublattices magnetizations are non - zero , ( ii ) a mean value of the scalar product of spins from the same sublattice is equal to 1/4 , ( iii ) a mean value of the scalar product of spins from the different sublattices is close to -1/4 .      in this subsection",

    "hence , the time evolution of the property of interest @xmath121 should be examined separately .    in the present paper the initial state of a system",

    "@xmath131    where @xmath8 is the sublattice s number . in the present paper",
    "only the systems with conserved @xmath1-projection of the total spin are considered and in the initial states the @xmath1-projection of the total spin is zero .",
    "therefore , only the results for one sublattice magnetization are sufficient , the magnetization of the other sublattice being of the opposite sign .",
    "let us consider , first , the ising model    @xmath132    which is anisotropic because its hamiltonian does not commute with @xmath133 operator .",
    "we consider the case @xmath134 .",
    "the ground state in this case is doubly degenerate and both neel states  ( [ neel1 ] ) and  ( [ neel2 ] ) belong to it . in this case",
    "the neel state @xmath127 energy distribution @xmath135 is the @xmath136-function , the neel state is stationary , and    @xmath137 however , due to the degeneracy , the linear combination    @xmath138 also can be considered as the ground state , but in this state , contrary to the neel one , the magnetization of each sublattice is equal to zero .",
    "second , we consider the heisenberg model    @xmath139    which is isotropic as its hamiltonian commutes with @xmath133 operator .",
    "the neel state is not the eigenfunction of this hamiltonian and the energy distribution @xmath135 has some width .",
    "the width depends on the particular values of @xmath140 , @xmath141 parameters and in case @xmath142 it could be rather large , its maximum being shifted off the ground state energy .",
    "the neel state in the heisenberg model is not stationary and the probabilities @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and magnetization @xmath145 depend on time .",
    "their time dependences are shown in figures [ heis1 ] and [ heis2 ] for two variants of the heisenberg model . in figure [ heis1 ] the heisenberg model with only the nearest neighbors interaction",
    "is shown , whereas the figure [ heis2 ] corresponds to the case with the second neighbors interaction included , the latter being somewhat weaker than the nearest neighbors interaction .",
    "although the neel state in this model does not exactly decay ( the spectrum is pure discrete ) , one can see from figures [ heis1 ] and [ heis2 ] that the probability to find the system in the neel state quickly drops down and afterwards its time average remains small . besides , the time average of the sublattice magnetization is almost zero .",
    "next , we consider the well - known xxz - model with hamiltonian @xmath146 \\displaystyle + w\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\widehat{s}_{j , z}\\widehat{s}_{j+1,z } \\end{array } \\label{xxzh}\\ ] ] this model has two parameters @xmath147 and @xmath148 and the considered above ising and heisenberg models hamiltonians are particular cases of  ( [ xxzh ] ) with @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively . therefore , to consider the xxz - model we selected the particular anisotropic case @xmath151 , @xmath152 which is far from both ising and heisenberg cases discussed above .",
    "in the selected case the neel state energy distribution has two main weights @xmath153 and @xmath154 , which correspond to the ground and first excited states .",
    "weights @xmath153 and @xmath154 are approximately equal to each other and they are at least one order of magnitude greater than the weight of any other state . such energy distribution results in particular time dependences of @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 shown in figure [ xxz ] . the main feature is a harmonic oscillation of @xmath155 and @xmath156 superimposed by a small amplitude and high frequency oscillations .",
    "the @xmath118 of the harmonic oscillation is close to 1 , and @xmath117 is close to 0 .",
    "the @xmath155 would experience exactly harmonic oscillation if all weights other than @xmath153 and @xmath154 would be exactly zero .",
    "in such oscillation the frequency is defined by the energy gap between the ground and excited states , the @xmath118 value is equal to 1 , and @xmath117 value is defined by the weights difference , being zero when weights are exactly equal . in our case weights @xmath153 and @xmath154 are only close to each other and therefore , @xmath117 is small but not equal to zero .",
    "the similar oscillation ( with opposite phase ) of @xmath156 indicates that the energy distribution of another neel state @xmath157 is similar to that of @xmath127 but with interchanged @xmath153 and @xmath154 . from this",
    "we can conclude that both ground and first excited states are linear combinations of two neel states with approximately equal weights and neither of them is close to a single neel state .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the results of numerical calculations and is in accord with the time behavior of the sublattice magnetization shown in figure [ xxz ] . from this figure",
    "it is seen that the time average of the sublattice magnetization is close to zero .",
    "the result of numerical calculations is @xmath158 . besides , the sublattice magnetizations in the ground and the first excited states in the case considered are exactly zero .",
    "hence , although the time average of the probability to find the system in the initial neel state is essential ( 0.39 according to the numerical calculations ) , the magnetic properties of the system do not correspond to the neel state .",
    "the next model was constructed to satisfy two conditions .",
    "first , the system was chosen to be isotropic .",
    "hence , the system hamiltonian must commute with the total spin operator .",
    "second , the neel state energy distribution in the system must have the smallest possible number of components .",
    "for this the system hamiltonian must commute with sublattices square spin operators .",
    "indeed , in this case equations  ( [ lc1 ] ) and  ( [ lc2 ] ) show that only states with maximum spins of each sublattices contribute to the neel state energy distribution . based on these considerations ,",
    "the system hamiltonian was chosen in the form    @xmath159    with three parameters @xmath147 , @xmath160 , and @xmath148 .",
    "considering the neel state we see , that all functions @xmath22 from  ( [ clebsch ] ) onto which the neel state is exactly expanded are eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian . at the same time , from the equation  ( [ eq:15 ] ) it follows that the matrix of the first term in  ( [ ourh ] ) , calculated on @xmath22 , is proportional to the unit matrix . besides , all @xmath22 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath161 and @xmath162 with the same eigenvalue @xmath163 .",
    "hence , the matrix of the third term in  ( [ ourh ] ) , calculated on @xmath22 , is also proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "consequently , parameters @xmath147 and @xmath160 define only the position of the neel state distribution @xmath135 in the operator @xmath107 spectrum , while the parameter @xmath148 defines the energy distribution width @xmath164 .",
    "the neel state evolution in the considered model is periodic ( however not harmonic ) , because energy differences between all @xmath22 energy levels are commensurable ( @xmath165 ) .    .",

    "the parameters were chosen to place the energy levels of all eigenstates @xmath22 , which contribute to the neel state , below the rest of the spectrum .",
    "there are four main weights @xmath169 in the energy distribution in this case .",
    "therefore , the oscillation shape is more complicated than in the @xmath170 model with two main weights , and the maximum value of @xmath156 is well below 1 . the time average of the probability to find system in the initial neel state is about 0.29 .",
    "however , the time average of the sublattice magnetization is small ( about 0.001 ) . besides , the sublattice magnetization in the ground state is zero .",
    "therefore , similarly to the @xmath170 model , the magnetic properties of the system do not correspond to the neel state .",
    "next model was made to have the degenerate ground state with all and only functions @xmath22 belonging to it . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian , similarly to  ( [ ourh ] ) , must commute with the total spin operator and with the sublattices spin square operators .",
    "in addition , the ground state must correspond to the maximum spins of sublattices and to the zero @xmath1-projection of the total spin .",
    "besides , all other states must have higher energy than the ground state .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian satisfying these conditions is    @xmath171    similarly to the ising model , the neel state @xmath127 is the stationary state and in this state    @xmath137 in this model , contrary to the ising model , any neel - like state is also the stationary state .",
    "however , for any neel or neel - like state the partner state with the opposite sublattices magnetization also belongs to the ground state .",

    "finally , the simple model with hamiltonian    @xmath172 \\displaystyle s_k<\\frac{n}{2},\\qquad a<0 . \\end{array } \\label{proj}\\ ] ]    was considered where functions @xmath22 are defined by  ( [ clebsch ] ) .",
    "this model shows , that the time evolution of the neel state helps us to recognize the existence of the stationary neel - like state in the system where the neel state itself is not stationary .",
    "the peculiarity of the model is that the ground state is degenerate and the corresponding functional subspace is spanned by some ( not all ) functions @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the neel - like states are eigenstates of operator  ( [ proj ] ) and the neel state itself is not .",
    "the time evolution of the neel state in this model is shown in figure  [ proj1 ] . from this picture",
    "one can see that the probability @xmath155 to find the system in the initial neel state oscillates around some value close to 1 ( @xmath143 time average is equal to 0.97 according to the numerical calculations ) and the sublattice magnetization oscillates around a value close to the maximum ( time average is equal to 1.94 ) , the mentioned values being corresponded to the neel - like state .",
    "hence , the behavior of the neel state time evolution , similar to that shown in figure  [ proj1 ] , indicates that in the system there exists stationary neel - like state .",

    "indeed , in all models , except ising model and model with hamiltonian  ( [ degen ] ) , the neel state is not the eigenstate . in the ising model and the model  ( [ degen ] )",
    "the neel state is the eigenstate but it belongs to the degenerate level with the other neel state also belonging to this level . in this case",
    "even if a certain neel state was generated at a time @xmath173 it will be destroyed by small external perturbations which are always present in real circumstances . to be stable",
    "the neel state must be the ground non - degenerate state .",
    "however , it occur hamiltonian can be transformed to have the particular neel state as the ground non - degenerate eigenstate . to show this we will use the results of the paper  @xcite , where the following hamiltonian transformation was developed to get a desirable set of states for the lowest eigenstates .",
    "consider a hamiltonian @xmath174 with eigenfunctions @xmath175 and eigenvalues @xmath176    @xmath177 consider also an arbitrary set of @xmath178 orthonormal functions @xmath179 and an arbitrary set of real numbers @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) . in",
    "@xcite the potential in the form of the separable potential    @xmath182    was found so that the @xmath178 lowest eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath183    @xmath184 are exactly @xmath185 and @xmath186    @xmath187 while the rest of the @xmath174 spectrum is not affected    @xmath188 the eigenfunctions @xmath189 with @xmath190 differ , of course , from @xmath175 because former are orthogonal to @xmath179 , while later are orthogonal to @xmath191 , @xmath181 .    when only one eigenstate is to be transformed ( @xmath192 ) the functions @xmath193 and the matrix @xmath194 , @xmath195 can be chosen as follows    @xmath196 v_{11}= e_1-e^0_1,\\qquad v_{22}=|t|^2<f_2|f_3>,\\\\[10pt ] \\displaystyle v_{23}=v_{32}=-t^*,\\qquad t=\\frac{1}{1+<f_1|f_2 > } \\end{array}\\ ] ] all other matrix elements @xmath194 are equal to zero , so the separable potential  ( [ eq:41 ] ) has only four non - zero components .    using these results we can make the neel state @xmath197 be the ground non - degenerate state .",
