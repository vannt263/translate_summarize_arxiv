    "during the last 20 years the integrable case of s.  kowalevski @xcite has received several generalizations . among them a special place is given to the case @xcite of rotation about a fixed point of a heavy electrically charged gyrostat in gravitational and electric fields of force . for a rigid body without gyrostatic effects",
    "the corresponding equations were first considered in @xcite and interpreted as the equations of motion of a massive magnet subject to the gravity force and constant magnetic force fields .",
    "the mathematical model of superposition of such fields is referred to as _ two constant fields _ @xcite .",
    "the case @xcite does not have any explicit groups of symmetry and therefore provides an illustration of a physically realizable system with three degrees of freedom not admitting any obvious reduction to a family of systems with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the phase topology of irreducible systems has not been studied yet .",
    "the theory of @xmath1-dimensional integrable systems originated in @xcite has not been further developed due to the absence , at that moment , of non - trivial natural examples .",
    "the result @xcite succeeded some previous publications dealing with rigid bodies and gyrostats satisfying the conditions of kowalevski type : i.v .",
    "komarov @xcite has proved the complete integrability of the kowalevski gyrostat in gravity force field by finding the first generalization of the kowalevski integral @xmath2 ; the corresponding integral for the rigid body in two constant fields was pointed out by o.i .",

    "reyman and m.a .",
    "semenov - tian - shansky @xcite found the lax representation with spectral parameter ; this immediately led to the new integral generalizing the square of momentum integral for axially symmetric force fields .",
    "later , in a joint publication with a.i .",
    "bobenko @xcite , the authors of @xcite presented algebraic foundations for the integrability of multidimensional kowalevski gyrostats and described a viable way of explicit integration using finite - band technique .",
    "for two constant fields this integration was never fulfilled .",
    "this paper starts the investigation of three - dimensional phase topology of a rigid body of kowalevski type in two constant fields .",
