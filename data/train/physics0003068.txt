    "because the properties of molecular aggregates impact diverse areas ranging from nucleation and condensation@xcite to heterogeneous catalysis , the study of clusters has continued to be an important part of modern condensed matter science .",
    "clusters can be viewed as an intermediate phase of matter , and clusters can provide information about the transformation from finite to bulk behavior .",
    "furthermore , the potential surfaces of clusters can be complex , and many clusters are useful prototypes for studying other systems having complex phenomenology",
    ".    the properties of small clusters can be unusual owing to the dominance of surface rather than bulk atoms .",
    "a particularly important and well studied example of a property that owes its behavior to the presence of large numbers of surface atoms is cluster structure.@xcite the structure of clusters can differ significantly from the structure of the corresponding bulk material , and these differences in structure have implications about the properties of the clusters .",
    "for example , most small lennard - jones ( lj ) clusters have global potential surface minima that are based on icosahedral growth patterns .",
    "the five - fold symmetries of these clusters differ substantially from the closest - packed arrangements observed in bulk materials .    while most small lennard - jones clusters have geometries based on icosahedral core structures , there can be exceptions.@xcite a notable example is the 38-atom lennard - jones cluster [ lj@xmath0 .",
    "this cluster is particularly interesting owing to its complex potential surface and associated phenomenology .",
    "the potential surface for lj@xmath1 has been described in detail by doye , miller and wales@xcite who have carefully constructed the disconnectivity graph@xcite for the system using information garnered from basin hopping and eigenvector following studies of the low energy potential minima along with examinations of the transition state barriers .",
    "the general structure of this potential surface can be imagined to be two basins of similar energies separated by a large energy barrier with the lowest energy basin being significantly narrower than the second basin .",
    "striking is the global minimum energy structure for lj@xmath1 which , unlike the case for most small lennard - jones clusters , is not based on an icosahedral core , but rather is a symmetric truncated octahedron .",
    "the vertices defined by the surface atoms of lj@xmath1 have a morphology identical to the first brillouin zone of a face centered cubic lattice,@xcite and the high symmetry of the cluster may account for its stability .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent experimental studies@xcite of nickel clusters using nitrogen uptake measurements have found the global minimum of ni@xmath1 to be a truncated octahedron as well .",
    "the basin of energy minima about the global minimum of lj@xmath1 is narrow compared to the basin about the next highest energy isomer which does have an icosahedral core .",
    "the difference in energy between the global minimum and the lowest minimum in the icosahedral basin is only 0.38% of the energy of the global minimum.@xcite    characteristic of some thermodynamic properties of small clusters are ranges of temperature over which these properties change rapidly in a fashion reminiscent of the divergent behavior known to occur in bulk phase transitions at a single temperature .",
    "the rapid changes in such thermodynamic properties for clusters are not divergent and occur over a range of temperatures owing to the finite sizes of the systems . in accord with the usage introduced by berry , beck , davis and jellinek@xcite",
    "we refer to the temperature ranges where rapid changes occur as `` phase change '' regions , rather than using the term `` phase transition , '' that is reserved for systems at the thermodynamic limit . as an example lj@xmath2 displays a heat capacity anomaly over a range in temperatures often associated with what has been termed `` cluster melting.''@xcite molecular dynamics and microcanonical simulations performed at kinetic temperatures in the melting region of lj@xmath2 exhibit van der waals type loops in the caloric curves and coexistence between solid - like and liquid - like forms .    in recent studies , doye , wales and miller@xcite and miller , doye and wales@xcite have examined the phase change behavior of lj@xmath1 .",
    "these authors have calculated the heat capacity and isomer distributions as a function of temperature using the superposition method.@xcite in the superposition method the microcanonical density of states is calculated for each potential minimum , and the total density of states is then constructed by summation with respect to each local density of states . because it is not possible to find all potential minima for a system as complex as lj@xmath1 , the summation is augmented with factors that represent the effective weights of the potential minima that are included in the sum .",
    "the superposition method has also been improved to account for anharmonicities and stationary points.@xcite for lj@xmath1 doye _",
    "et al._@xcite have identified two phase change regions .",
    "the first , accompanied by a heat capacity maximum , is associated with a solid - to - solid phase change between the truncated octahedral basin and the icosahedral basin .",
    "a higher temperature heat capacity anomaly represents the solid - liquid coexistence region , similar to that found in other cluster systems .",
    "the heat capacity anomaly associated with the melting transition in lj@xmath1 is steeper and more pronounced than the heat capacity peak that doye _",
    "et al._@xcite have associated with the solid - solid transition . because the weights that enter in the sum to construct the microcanonical density of states are estimated , it is important to confirm the findings of doye _",
    "et al._@xcite by detailed numerical simulation .",
    "such simulations are a goal of the current work and its companion paper .",
    "as is found in section iii , the simulations provide a heat capacity curve for lj@xmath1 that has some qualitative differences with the curve reported by doye _",
    "et al._@xcite    owing to the complex structure of the potential surface of lj@xmath1 , the system represents a particularly challenging case for simulation .",
    "it is well known that simulations of systems having more than one important region of space separated by significant energy barriers can be difficult .",
    "the difficulties are particularly severe if any of the regions are either narrow or reachable only via narrow channels .",
    "the narrow basin about the global minimum makes simulations of lj@xmath1 especially difficult .",
    "there are several methods that have been developed that can prove to be useful in overcoming such ergodicity difficulties in simulations .",
    "many of these methods use information about the underlying potential surface generated from simulations on the system using parameters where the various regions of configuration space are well - connected .",
    "one of the earliest of these methods is j - walking@xcite where information about the potential surface is obtained from simulations at high temperatures , and the information is passed to low temperature walks by jumping periodically to the high temperature walk .",
    "closely allied with j - walking is the parallel tempering method@xcite where configurations are exchanged between walkers running at two differing temperatures . a related approach,@xcite similar in spirit to j - walking ,",
    "uses tsallis distributions that are sufficiently broad to cover much of configuration space .",
    "another recent addition@xcite to these methods is the use of multicanonical distributions@xcite in the jumping process .",
    "multicanonical walks are performed using the entropy of the system , and multicanonical distributions are nearly independent of the energy thereby allowing easy transitions between energy basins .",
    "as we discuss in the current work , we have found the parallel tempering method to be most useful in the context of simulations of lj@xmath1 .",
    "a comparative discussion of some of the methods outlined above is given later in this paper .",
    "in the current work we apply parallel tempering to the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of lj@xmath1 in the canonical ensemble . in the paper that follows@xcite we again use parallel tempering to study lj@xmath1 , but using molecular dynamics methods along with microcanonical monte carlo simulations .",
    "our goals are to understand better this complex system and to determine the best simulation method for systems of comparable complexity .",
    "the contents of the remainder of this first paper are as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the methods used with particular emphasis on the parallel tempering approach and its relation to the j - walking method . in section",
    "iii we present the results including the heat capacity as a function of temperature and identify the phase change behaviors of lj@xmath1 . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions and describe our experiences with alternatives to parallel tempering for insuring ergodicity .",
    "for canonical simulations we model a cluster with @xmath3 atoms by the standard lennard - jones potential augmented by a constraining potential @xmath4 used to define the cluster    @xmath5 + u_c,\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the standard lennard - jones length and energy parameters , and @xmath8 is the distance between particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the constraining potential is necessary because clusters at defined temperatures have finite vapor pressures , and the evaporation events can make the association of any atom with the cluster ambiguous . for classical monte carlo simulations , a perfectly reflecting constraining",
    "potential is most convenient @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the center of mass of the cluster , and we call @xmath14 the constraining radius",
    ".    thermodynamic properties of the system are calculated with monte carlo methods using the parallel tempering technique.@xcite to understand the application of the parallel tempering method and to understand the comparison of parallel tempering with other related methods , it is useful to review the basic principles of monte carlo simulations .    in the canonical ensemble",
    "the goal is the calculation of canonical expectation values .",
    "for example , the average potential energy is expressed @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 the temperature and @xmath18 the boltzmann constant . in monte carlo simulations",
    "such canonical averages are determined by executing a random walk in configuration space so that the walker visits points in space with a probability proportional to the canonical density @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 is the configurational integral that normalizes the density . after generating @xmath21 such configurations in a random walk ,",
    "the expectation value of the potential energy is approximated by @xmath22 the approximate expectation value @xmath23 becomes exact in the limit that @xmath24 .",
    "a sufficiency condition for the random walk to visit configuration space with a probability proportional to the density @xmath25 is the detailed balance condition@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent two configurations of the system and @xmath29 is the conditional probability that if the system is at configuration @xmath27 it makes a transition to @xmath28 . in many monte carlo approaches ,",
    "the conditional probability is not known and is replaced by the expression @xmath30 where @xmath31 is called the trial probability and @xmath32 is an acceptance probability constructed to ensure @xmath29 satisfies the detailed balance condition .",
    "the trial probability can be any normalized density function chosen for convenience .",
    "a common choice for the acceptance probability is given by@xcite @xmath33.\\label{eq : acc}\\ ] ] the metropolis method,@xcite obtained from eq.([eq : acc ] ) by choosing @xmath31 to be a uniform distribution of points of width @xmath34 centered about @xmath27 , is arguably the most widely used monte carlo method and the basis for all the approaches discussed in the current work .",
    "the metropolis method rigorously guarantees a random walk visits configuration space proportional to a given density function asymptotically in the limit of an infinite number of steps . in practice when configuration space is divided into important regions separated by significant energy barriers ,",
    "a low temperature finite metropolis walk can have prohibitively long equilibration times .",
    "such problems in attaining ergodicity in the walk do not occur at temperatures sufficiently high that the system has significant probability of finding itself in the barrier regions . in both the j - walking and parallel tempering methods ,",
    "information obtained from an ergodic metropolis walk at high temperatures is passed to a low temperature walker periodically to enable the low temperature walker to overcome the barriers between separated regions . in the j - walking method@xcite the trial probability at inverse temperature @xmath35 is taken to be a high temperature boltzmann distribution @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the jumping temperature that is sufficiently high that a metropolis walk can be assumed to be ergodic .",
    "introduction of eq.([eq : trialj ] ) into eq.([eq : acc ] ) results in the acceptance probability @xmath38 \\right \\}.\\label{eq : acj}\\ ] ] in practice at inverse temperature @xmath35 the trial moves are taken from the metropolis distribution about 90% of the time with jumps attempted using eq.([eq : trialj ] ) about 10% of the time .",
    "the jumping configurations are generated with a metropolis walk at inverse temperature @xmath37 , and jump attempts are accepted using eq.([eq : acj ] ) . the acceptance expression [ eq.([eq : acj ] ) ] is correct provided the configurations chosen for jumping are a random representation of the distribution @xmath39 .",
    "the metropolis walk that is used to generate the configurations at inverse temperature @xmath37 is correlated,@xcite and eq.([eq : acj ] ) is inappropriate unless jumps are attempted sufficiently infrequently to break the correlations . in practice metropolis",
    "walks are still correlated after 10 steps , and it is not possible to use eq.([eq : acj ] ) correctly if jumps are attempted 10% of the time . in",
    "j - walking the difficulty with correlations is overcome in two ways . in the first method , often called serial j - walking,@xcite a large set of configurations is stored to an external distribution with the configurations generated with a metropolis walk at inverse temperature @xmath37 , and configurations stored only after sufficient steps to break the correlations in the metropolis walk .",
    "additionally , the configurations are chosen from the external distribution at random .",
    "this external distribution is made sufficiently large that the probability of ever choosing the same configuration more than once is small . in this method",
    "detailed balance is strictly satisfied only in the limit that the external distribution is of infinite size . in the second method ,",
    "often called parallel j - walking,@xcite the walks at each temperature are made in tandem on a parallel machine .",
    "many processors , randomly initialized , are assigned to the jumping temperature , and each processor at the jumping temperature is used to donate a high temperature configuration to the low temperature walk sufficiently infrequently that the correlations in the metropolis walk at inverse temperature @xmath37 are broken . in this parallel method ,",
    "configurations are never reused , but the acceptance criterion [ eq.([eq : acj ] ) ] is strictly valid only in the limit of an infinite set of processors at inverse temperature @xmath37 . in practice",
    "both serial and parallel j - walking work well for many applications with finite external distributions or with a finite set of processors.@xcite    in parallel tempering@xcite configurations from a high temperature walk are also used to make a low temperature walk ergodic .",
    "in contrast to j - walking rather than the high temperature walk feeding configurations to the low temperature walk , the high and low temperature walkers exchange configurations . by exchanging configurations detailed balance is satisfied , once the metropolis walks at the two temperatures are sufficiently long to be in the asymptotic region . to verify detailed balance",
    "is satisfied by the parallel tempering procedure we let @xmath40 be the joint density that the low temperature walker is at configuration @xmath41 and the high temperature walker is at configuration @xmath42 .",
    "when configurations between the two walkers are exchanged , the detailed balance condition is @xmath43 by solving for the ratio of the conditional transition probabilities @xmath44,\\ ] ] it is evident that if exchanges are accepted with the same probability as the acceptance criterion used in j - walking [ see eq.([eq : acj ] ) ] , detailed balance is satisfied .",
    "although the basic notions used by both j - walking and parallel tempering are similar , the organization of a parallel tempering calculation can be significantly simpler than the organization of a j - walking calculation . in parallel tempering no external distributions are required nor are multiple processors required at any temperature .",
    "parallel tempering can be organized in the same simple way that serial tandem j - walking is organized as discussed in the original j - walking reference.@xcite unlike serial tandem j - walking where detailed balance can be attained only asymptotically , parallel tempering satisfies detailed balance directly . for a problem as difficult as lj@xmath1 where very long simulations are required ,",
    "the huge external distributions needed in serial j - walking , or the large set of jumping processors needed in parallel j - walking , make the method prohibitive .",
    "as discussed in section iii , parallel tempering can be executed for arbitrarily long simulations making the method suitable at least for lj@xmath1 .    in the current calculation",
    "parallel tempering is used not just to simulate the system at some low temperature using high temperature information , but simulations are performed for a series of temperatures . as is the case for j - walking@xcite and as discussed elsewhere for parallel tempering,@xcite the gaps between adjacent temperatures can not be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "temperature gaps must be chosen so that exchanges are accepted with sufficient frequency .",
    "if the temperature gap is too large , the configurations important at the two exchanging temperatures can be sufficiently dissimilar that no exchanges are ever accepted .",
    "preliminary calculations must be performed to explore the temperature differences needed for acceptable exchange probabilities . in practice",
    "we have found at least 10% of attempted exchanges need to be accepted for the parallel tempering procedure to be useful . in general the temperature gaps must be decreased near phase change regions or when the temperature becomes low .    by exchanging configurations between temperatures ,",
    "correlations are introduced at different temperature points .",
    "for example , the average heat capacities at two temperatures may rise or fall together as each value fluctuates statistically . in some cases",
    "the values of the heat capacities or other properties at two temperatures can be anti - correlated .",
    "the magnitude of these correlations between temperatures are measured and discussed in section iii .",
    "as discussed in section iii the correlations between differing temperatures imply that the statistical fluctuations must be sufficiently low to ensure any features observed in a calculation as a function of temperature are meaningful .",
    "forty distinct temperatures have been used in the parallel tempering simulations of lj@xmath1 ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the simulations have been initiated from random configurations of the 38 atoms within a constraining sphere of radius 2.25 @xmath6 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath47 , because we have had difficulties attaining ergodicity with larger constraining radii . with large constraining radii",
    ", the system has a significant boiling region at temperatures not far from the melting region , and it is difficult to execute an ergodic walk with any method when there is coexistence between liquid - like and vapor regions . constraining radii smaller than @xmath48 can induce significant changes in thermodynamic properties below the temperature of the melting peak . using the randomly initialized configurations the initialization time to reach the asymptotic region in the monte carlo walk has been found to be long with about 95 million metropolis monte carlo points followed by 190 million parallel tempering monte carlo points included in the walk prior to data accumulation .",
    "this long initiation period can be made significantly shorter by initializing each temperature with the structure of the global minimum .",
    "we have chosen to initialize the system with random configurations to verify the parallel tempering method is able to equilibrate this system with no prior knowledge about the structure of the potential surface . following this initiation period ,",
    "@xmath49 points have been included with data accumulation .",
    "parallel tempering exchanges have been attempted every 10 monte carlo passes over the 38 atoms in the cluster .    in an attempt to minimize the correlations in the data at differing temperatures , an exchange strategy has been used that includes exchanges between several temperatures . to understand this strategy , we let the set of temperatures be put into an array .",
    "one - half of the exchanges have been attempted between adjacent temperatures in the array , one - fourth have been attempted between next near neighboring temperatures , one - eighth between every third temperature , one - sixteenth between every fourth temperature and one - thirty second between every fifth temperature in the array .",
    "we have truncated this procedure at fifth near neighboring temperatures , because exchanges between temperatures differing by more than fifth neighbors are accepted with frequencies of less than ten per cent .",
    "the data presented in this work have been generated using the procedure outlined above .",
    "in retrospect , we have found exchanges are only required between adjacent temperatures .",
    "we have also performed the calculations where exchanges are included only between adjacent temperatures , and we have seen no significance differences either in the final results or in the correlations between different temperatures . using the random initializations of the clusters , after the initialization period the lowest temperature walks are dominated by configurations well represented by small amplitude oscillations about the global minimum structure .    for all data displayed in this work , the error bars represent two standard deviations of the mean .",

    "the order parameter has been used by doye _",
    "et al._@xcite to monitor phase changes in lj@xmath1 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath55 is defined by the equation @xmath56 where @xmath57 to understand the parameters used in eq.([eq : sh ] ) , it is helpful to explain how @xmath58 is evaluated . the center of mass of the full 38 atom cluster is located and the atom closest to the center of mass is then identified .",
    "the atom closest to the center of mass plus the 12 nearest neighbors of that atom define a `` core '' cluster of the 38 atom cluster .",
    "the center of mass of the core cluster is then calculated .",

    "are identical numerically owing to the rotational symmetry of the spherical harmonics . however , for distorted clusters the two definitions differ numerically . for perfect , undistorted icosahedral clusters @xmath65 whereas for perfect , undistorted truncated octahedral clusters , @xmath66 , and both definitions of the order parameter are able to distinguish configurations from the truncated octahedral basin and other basins at finite temperatures .",

    "of course , it is impossible to verify that the identification of all values of @xmath55 with a particular structure as discussed above would agree with the result of quenching the structure to its nearest potential minimum .",
    "the differences found by defining icosahedral , truncated octahedral or liquid - like structures using either an energy criterion or @xmath55 is clarified by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : quenches ] and the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "both definitions are arbitrary , and the information carried by the two classification methods complement each other .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] also provides additional evidence that the peak in @xmath80 is associated with the equilibrium between the truncated octahedral structures and the icosahedral structures .",
    "there is significant density for both kinds of structures in the region between the lowest two parallel lines that define the region with the slope change .",
    "additionally , both icosahedral structures and truncated octahedral structures begin to be in equilibrium with each other at the beginning of the slope change region . this equilibrium continues to temperatures above the melting region .",
    "another identification of the slope change region with a transition between truncated octahedral and icosahedral forms can be made by defining @xmath81 to be the probability that an atom in the cluster is found at location @xmath82 to @xmath83 from the center of mass of the cluster at temperature @xmath17 .",
    "a projection of @xmath84 onto the @xmath82 and @xmath17 plane is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the solid vertical lines represent the location of atoms from the center of mass of the truncated octahedral structure ( the lower set of vertical lines ) , and the lowest energy icosahedral structure ( the upper set of vertical lines ) . as in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , increased probability is represented by the lighter shading . at the lowest temperatures @xmath84",
    "is dominated by contributions from the truncated octahedron as is evident by comparing the shaded regions with the lowest set of vertical lines . as the temperature is increased , contributions to @xmath84 begin to appear from the icosahedral structures .",
    "the shaded region at @xmath85 does not match any of the vertical lines shown , but corresponds to atoms in the third lowest energy isomer , which like the second lowest energy isomer , comes from the icosahedral basin .",
    "the equilibrium between the icosahedral and truncated octahedral structures observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] matches the regions of temperature observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "we have mentioned previously that parallel tempering introduces correlations in the data accumulated at different temperatures , and it is important to ensure the statistical errors are sufficiently small that observed features are real and not artifacts of the correlations . to measure these correlations",
    "we define a cross temperature correlation function for some temperature dependent property @xmath86 by @xmath87^{1/2}}.\\label{eq : gam}\\ ] ] a projection of @xmath88 when @xmath89 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] white represents @xmath90 and black represents @xmath91 with other shadings representing values of @xmath92 between these two extremes .",
    "the white diagonal line from the lower left hand corner to the upper right hand corner represents the case that @xmath93 so that @xmath90 . the light shaded areas near this diagonal represent cases where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are adjacent temperatures in the parallel tempering simulations , and we find @xmath92 to be only slightly less than unity .",
    "more striking are the black regions off the diagonal where @xmath92 is nearly @xmath96 .",
    "these black regions correspond to anti - correlations between results at temperatures near the heat capacity maximum in the melting peak and temperatures near the center of the slope change region associated with the transition between icosahedral and truncated octahedral structures .",
    "these correlations imply the importance of performing sufficiently long simulations to ensure that statistical fluctuations of the data are small compared to important features in the data as a function of temperature .",
    "using parallel tempering methods we have successfully performed ergodic simulations of the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of lj@xmath1 in the canonical ensemble . as discussed by doye _",
    "et al._@xcite the potential surface of this system is complex with two significant basins ; a narrow basin about the global minimum truncated octahedral structure , and a wide icosahedral basin .",
    "these two basins are separated both by structure and a large energy barrier making simulations difficult . in agreement with the results of doye _",
    "et al._@xcite we find clear evidence of equilibria between structures at the basin of the global minimum and the icosahedral basin at temperatures below the melting region .",
    "unlike previous work we find no heat capacity maximum associated with this transition , but rather a region with a change in the slope of the heat capacity as a function of temperature .",
    "we have found parallel tempering to be successful with this system , and have noted correlations in our data at different temperatures when the parallel tempering method is used .",
    "these correlations imply the need to perform long simulations so that the statistical errors are sufficiently small that the correlations do not introduce artificial conclusions .",
    "we believe that the methods used in this work could be applied to a variety of other systems including clusters of complexity comparable to lj@xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the 75-atom lennard - jones cluster is known to share many features with the 38-atom cluster investigated here .",
    "lj@xmath97 is also characterized by a double funnel energy landscape , one funnel being associated with icosahedral structures , and the other funnel being associated with the decahedral global minimum .",
    "the landscape of lj@xmath97 has been recently investigated by doye , miller and wales@xcite who have used @xmath98 as the order parameter . in another paper,@xcite wales and doye",
    "have predicted that the temperature where the decahedral / icosahedral equilibrium takes place should be close to @xmath99 .",
    "this prediction is made by using the superposition method , but no caloric curves have yet been reported for lj@xmath97 . the parallel tempering monte carlo method can be expected to work well for lj@xmath97 , and such a parallel tempering study would be another good test case for theoretical methods discussed in this work .    a useful enhancement of parallel tempering monte carlo is the use of multiple histogram methods@xcite that enables the calculation of thermodynamic functions in both the canonical and microcanonical ensembles by the calculation of the microcanonical entropy . in practice the multiple histogram method requires the generation of histograms of the potential energy at a set of temperatures such that there is appreciable overlap of the potential energy distributions at adjacent temperatures .",
    "this overlap requirement is identical to the choice of temperatures needed in parallel tempering .    in performing simulations on lj@xmath1",
    "we have tried other methods to reduce ergodicity errors , and we close this section by summarizing the difficulties we have encountered with these alternate methods .",
    "it is important to recognize that the parallel tempering simulations include in excess of @xmath100 monte carlo points , and most of our experience with these alternate methods have come from significantly shorter simulations .",
    "our ability to include this large number of monte carlo points with parallel tempering is an important reason why we feel parallel tempering is so useful .",
    "> from experience with other smaller and simpler clusters , for a j - walking simulation to include @xmath100 points , an external distribution containing at least @xmath101 points is required to prevent oversampling of the distribution .",
    "such a large distribution is prohibitive with current computer technology .",
    "our j - walking simulations containing about @xmath102 monte carlo points have resulted in data that have not been internally reproducible , and data that are not in good agreement with the parallel tempering data .",
    "many long j - walking simulations with configurations initiated at random only have icosahedral structures at the lowest calculated temperatures . to stabilize the j - walking method with respect to the inclusion of truncated octahedral structures at low temperatures , we have attempted to generate distributions using the modified potential energy function @xmath103 .",
    "in this modified potential @xmath104 is a parameter chosen to deepen the octahedral basin without significantly distorting the cluster .",
    "while this modified potential has led to more stable results than j - walking using the bare potential , the results with @xmath105 monte carlo points have not been reproducible in detail .",
    "the application of tsallis distributions@xcite has not improved this situation .",
    "we have also tried to apply the multicanonical j - walking approach recently introduced by xu and berne.@xcite while this multicanonical approach has been shown to improve the original j - walking strategy for other cluster systems , in the case of lj@xmath1 the iterations needed to produce the external multicanonical distribution have not produced truncated octahedral structures .",
    "the iterations have produced external distributions having either liquid - like structures or structures from the icosahedral basin .",
    "the multicanonical distribution is known to have deficiencies at low energies , and this low energy difficulty appears to be problematic for lj@xmath1 . we have attempted to solve these deficiencies by including prior information about the thermodynamics of the system . in this attempt",
    "we have chosen the multicanonical weight to be @xmath106 $ ] where @xmath107 is the microcanonical entropy extracted from a multihistogram analysis@xcite of a parallel tempering monte carlo simulation . in several attempts using this approach we have not observed either the truncated octahedral structure nor structures from the icosahedral basin with significant probability .",
    "the multicanonical distribution so generated is dominated by liquid - like structures , and the distribution appears to be incapable of capturing the solid - to - solid transition that leads to the low temperature peak in @xmath53 .",
    "whether there are other approaches to generate a multicanonical distribution that are more successful in capturing low temperature behaviors is unknown to us .",
    "much insight about phase change behaviors can be obtained from simulations in the microcanonical ensemble or using molecular dynamics methods .",
    "for example , the van der waals loops observed in lj@xmath2@xcite complement the interpretation of the canonical caloric curves . in the next paper@xcite we present parallel tempering results for lj@xmath1 using both molecular dynamics and microcanonical monte carlo methods .",
