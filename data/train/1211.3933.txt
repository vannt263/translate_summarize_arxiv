    "in this paper we will study a class of one - step schemes for odes , i.e. the class of rosenbrock methods , in the context of odes with discontinuous right - hand side , with particular reference to singularly perturbed discontinuous odes . the class of problems we are dealing with is generally expressed in the form :    @xmath0    for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the state space @xmath3 is split ( locally ) into two subspaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 by a surface @xmath6 such that @xmath7 .",
    "the surface is defined by a scalar _ event _ function @xmath8 , so that the subspaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , are characterized as @xmath9-th step , is to check the sign of @xmath10 : if this product is greater than zero , then we continue using the same vector field ( @xmath11 , or @xmath12 ) as in the @xmath13-th step .",
    "otherwise , if the product is less than zero , this means that we need to switch to the other vector field , or to a sliding vector field ; in the _ event driven _ approach , that is the approach we will follow , this switching of the vector field requires the accurate computation of the _ event _ , i.e. the state in which the event function @xmath14 vanishes ; as a matter of fact , our coverage will mainly focus on the problems of the event detection .",
    "+ event - driven methods can be applied just when there are finitely many event points .",
    "this class of methods is widely used ( see @xcite ) ; it seems to be particularly suited since it has been proved ( see for example @xcite , and section 3 of this paper ) that the order of any method ( both explicit and implicit , both one - step and multi - step ) falls to one when discontinuity occurs and the event is not accurately located . hence , we could say that the event location reduces the stiffness of the problem due to the discontinuity . +",
    "another important issue of this paper is the so - called _ one - sided approach_. as a matter of fact , when we numerically solve a discontinuous system of the form ( [ system1 ] ) , we would wish that the vector fields @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 would be defined also beyond @xmath6 .",
    "neverthless , in certain situations , the vector field is not defined everywhere because the model is designed to be applicable only in certain regions of the state space .",
    "this particular type of systems , sometimes called systems with _",
    "model singularities _ , can be found , for example , in @xcite .    as simple example ( taken from @xcite ) we may consider    @xmath15    where one of the vector fields is not defined when @xmath16 .",
    "in general , every differential system whose right - hand side involves square roots , logarithms , inverse trigonometric functions , possesses a _ singularity _ , where by singularity we mean the region of the state space in which the derivative function @xmath17 in ( [ system1 ] ) is undefined .",
    "the events that occur in a neighborhood of a model singularity are often referred to as _ unilateral events _ , which means that they should be detected without allowing the numerical solution to trespass the event itself .",
    "+ for this reason , we can not use implicit methods , since they require evaluating @xmath18 at possibly singular endpoints .",
    "this is the rationale of the approach proposed in section 3 .    we know from filippov theory (",
    "see for example @xcite ) what can happen when the solution hits the surface @xmath6 .",
    "we will focus on the event location : what will happen after the event is not our present concern .",
    "+    finally , we will focus on a particular class of discontinuous odes : the discontinuous singularly perturbed systems .",
    "the presence of a singular perturbation in a discontinuous system arises in a lot of applications ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ of course these systems are difficult to solve , because of the discontinuity , and , most of all , because of the singular perturbation , which introduces a strong stiffness in the problem . the use of rosenbrock methods is particularly convenient for these systems , because of the low computational effort , and of the good stability properties . this will be shown in section 5 .",
    "as we shall see in the following , rosenbrock schemes turn out to be very advantageous in the context both of one - sided methods and of discontinuous singularly perturbed problems .",
    "+ rosenbrock methods come out from the linearization of diagonally implicit runge - kutta methods ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they preserve good stability properties typical of implicit schemes ; on the other hand , an @xmath19-stage rosenbrock method requires a lower computational effort , since just @xmath19 linear systems must be solved . [",
    "frequently , as we shall see later , we can handle the method in such a way that the @xmath19 linear systems to be solved have the same coefficient matrix . ]",
    "+ for an autonomous system , like the one in ( [ system1 ] ) , an _",
    "@xmath19-stage rosenbrock method _ has the following expression : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the coefficients of the method , and @xmath24 .",
    "+ each stage of this method requires the solution of @xmath19- linear systems with unknowns @xmath25 , and with matrix @xmath26 .",
    "most popular rosenbrock methods ( see , for example , @xcite ) set @xmath27 , for every @xmath28 .",
    "this position is computationally advantageous , since all the matrices are equal and we only need one lu - factorization per step . particularly interesting",
    "is the use of rosenbrock methods in a singularly perturbed system with discontinuous right - hand side , as we shall see in section 6 .",
    "+      the phenomenon of order reduction in discontinuous differential systems , when the event is not accurately located , is well - known in the literature .",
    "gear and sterby , for instance , deduced the order reduction in predictor - corrector methods ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , according to the pioneering work of mannshardt , ( see @xcite ) , lopez and dieci ( see @xcite ) have accurately computed the global error for explicit euler method ; they have shown that there are two contributions to the @xmath29 term in the global error : the first depends on the fact that euler s method is a first order method , while the second contribution comes directly from the jump and does not depend on the order of the method .",
    "+ we will give an example of the order reduction of a @xmath30-stages rosenbrock method , following the approach of @xcite for the explicit euler method .",
    "+ what we want to do is to evaluate the leading term of the local truncation error in the discontinuity interval . for simplicity of notation , we assume @xmath31 , but this assumption is not restrictive .",
    "naturally , localizing assumption applies , i.e. @xmath32 ; also , we call @xmath33 the instant of the event . + our 2-stage rosenbrock methods , applied to the problem ( [ system1 ] ) , reads : @xmath34    calling @xmath35 the inverse of the matrix @xmath36 , and assuming that both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in @xmath4 , the method ( [ rosenbrock_2_step ] ) can be written as @xmath39    a taylor s expansion of the exact solution up to the first order gives : @xmath40 while the local truncation error ( @xmath41 ) at @xmath42 becomes : @xmath43    a first order approximation of our second - order method is sufficient to highlight the proportionality of the local truncation error ( in the discontinuity interval ) with the jump , by means of a positive proportionality factor that is less than @xmath44 .",
    "thus , denoting by @xmath45 the spectral radius of matrix @xmath46 , if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 on the other hand , if @xmath49 , we can expand the term @xmath50 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the jacobian of @xmath11 evaluated in some point in @xmath4 .",
    "+ by means of ( [ marial ] ) and ( [ sviluppo_1 ] ) we get that ( [ isabella ] ) becomes @xmath53 + o(\\tau^2 ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] finally , since @xmath54 and @xmath55 we get that @xmath56 + o(\\tau^2).\\ ] ] we have thus shown the order reduction of this second order rosenbrock method when applied to a discontinuous differential equation like ( [ system1 ] ) . +   +      in general , any numerical method for odes provides an approximation of the solution at certain mesh points . on the other hand , in certain applications ( graphics , delay differential equations , initial value problems with driving conditions ) ,",
    "these discrete values are not enough .",
    "we could need a _ dense output _",
    ", i.e. , a numerical solution defined in each point @xmath57 in the integration interval , @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the event location , in the context of discontinuous differential equations , is one of the cases in which the idea of continuous extension can be advantageous .",
    "naturally , dense output formulas can be found in different ways : first of all , trivially , by piecewise linear or cubic interpolants .",
    "nevertheless , for runge - kutta methods there are more specific manners : perturbed collocated solutions ( see @xcite ) , and the classical _ continuous extension _ proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is known that , for the classes of gauss and radau formulas , these collocation methods have almost half the order of the method itself .",
    "some authors ( see @xcite and @xcite ) add some extra stages to achieve an accuracy of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the order of this method .",
    "+ now , in the context of discontinuous differential systems , dense output for runge - kutta formulas have been proposed both in @xcite , and also in @xcite . in this latter paper , for example , authors are able to find the event point simply by seeking the root of a second order continuous extension of the explicit midpoint rule . in this way , further evaluations of function @xmath61 are avoided , and just a second - order polynomial has to be updated .",
    "it is noteworth that the continuous extensions of rosenbrock methods have been proposed also in the context of daes : in @xcite two rosenbrock methods are proposed : a 4-stage rosenbrock scheme of order 3 , and a 3-stage rosenbrock method of order 2 . + here ,",
    "we focus on the continuous extension of rosenbrock methods , whose theory has been investigated -in the smooth case- in @xcite .",
    "the theory of ostermann , who threads the same path as zennaro ( see @xcite ) for continuos extensions of runge - kutta methods , gives a technique for evaluate the solution outside of the mesh , i.e. for approximate @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "we define @xmath63 a _ continuos extension _ of rosenbrock method ( [ aut_rosenb ] ) , where the functions @xmath64 are polynomials and satisfy :    i ) : :    @xmath65 ; ii ) : :    @xmath66 .",
    "we point out that ( [ cont_ext ] ) only needs already known facts ( the stages @xmath25 ) and can be evaluated cheaply , since just a low - order polynomial in @xmath67 must be updated .",
    "+ let us denote by @xmath68 $ ] the function _ integer part _ ; thus we know , by , that every rosenbrock method of order @xmath60 possesses at least one continuous extension of order @xmath69 $ ] , of the form ( [ cont_ext ] ) ; moreover the polynomials @xmath70 are defined in theorem 1 of @xcite , and have degree at most @xmath71 . nevertheless , ostermann s theory does not exclude the chance of finding a continuous extension that retains the order of the underlying method .",
    "+    as a matter of fact , we are going to use a second order continuous extension of a second - order rosenbrock method .",
    "the advantage of this choice , with respect to the choice in @xcite , is that just a 2-stages method is needed to get a second - order approximation .",
    "+ the rosenbrock scheme we use has been introduced in @xcite and reads    [ eqn : isabella3 ] @xmath72    for @xmath73 .",
    "now , a second - order continuos extension of this method has been proposed in @xcite :    [ isabella_cleavage ] @xmath74    let us assume we are integrating by method ( [ eqn : isabella3 ] ) .",
    "when an event has occurred , i.e. when @xmath75 , then we need to compute accurately the state vector @xmath76 such that @xmath77 .",
    "this is simply done by computing the root of the scalar function @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the numerical solution of our rosenbrock method in ( [ eqn : isabella3 ] ) .",
    "this computation is accomplished by a classical root - finding routine , such as secant or bisection method .",
    "+ every root - finding routine will produce a sequence @xmath80 .",
    "of course , the computation of each term of the sequence requires of updating the internal stages @xmath81 and @xmath82 , since the internal stages depend on the step size .",
    "this can be avoided by using the continuous extension ( [ isabella_cleavage ] ) , that has the great advantage ( as we shall see in numerical tests , in the last section ) of preserving the order of the method .",
    "thus , we are going to compute the root of the new function @xmath83 , for @xmath84 , with a great computational saving .",
    "finally , we are going to see in the next section that the continuous extension can be very useful also in order to give one - sided conditions .",
    "further to what we said in the introduction about model singularities , we provide an interesting example , proposed in @xcite , of a planar two - link robotic manipulator with workspace limitations ( see figure [ example_2_arms ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of this system are described by the following system of odes :    @xmath85    for certain functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "now , we could express @xmath88 and @xmath89 as functions of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which denote the position of the two arms in the plane :    @xmath92        where    @xmath93    let us assume , for instance , to be in region @xmath4 , thus we are integrating vector field @xmath11 .",
    "we will consider the case in which @xmath11 can not be evaluated outside @xmath94 .",
    "in this situation we will consider _ one - sided _ rosenbrock schemes that do not require the evaluation of the vector field @xmath11 outside @xmath94 .",
    "this approach has been proposed in @xcite in the context of explicit runge - kutta methods .",
    "the idea is very simple : to give sufficient conditions for which the internal stages of a rosenbrock method can be computed even in presence of a model singularity .",
    "for example , for the two - stages rosenbrock method ( [ eqn : isabella3 ] ) , this means to give conditions for which @xmath11 can be evaluated in @xmath95 : this will ensure that @xmath96 can be computed .",
    "we will give sufficient conditions under which one - stage rosenbrock methods approach the discontinuity from one side , and we will make use of the continuous extension ( [ isabella_cleavage ] ) in order to give one - sided conditions for the method ( [ eqn : isabella3 ] ) .",
    "one - stage rosenbrock : general case _ assuming @xmath97 , one stage rosenbrock method reads as : @xmath98 as in @xcite , we will assume that there is a positive constant @xmath99 such that @xmath100 now , if @xmath101 is the solution of ( [ system1 ] ) in the region @xmath4 , then + @xmath102 and condition ( [ lanciadelta ] ) implies that the function @xmath14 monotonically increases along a solution trajectory in @xmath4 ( close to @xmath6 ) until eventually the trajectory hits @xmath6 nontangentially .",
