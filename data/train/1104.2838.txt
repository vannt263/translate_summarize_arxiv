    "the study of quantum mechanical hamiltonians that are @xmath0-symmetric but not hermitian@xcite-@xcite has recently found an unexpected application in classical optics@xcite-@xcite , due to the fact that in the paraxial approximation the equation of propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a medium is formally identical to the schrdinger equation , but with different interpretations for the symbols appearing therein .",
    "the equation of propagation takes the form [ opteq ] i=-(+v(x ) ) , where @xmath6 represents the envelope function of the amplitude of the electric field , @xmath5 is a scaled propagation distance , and @xmath7 is the optical potential , proportional to the variation in the refractive index of the material through which the wave is passing .",
    "a complex @xmath8 corresponds to a complex refractive index , whose imaginary part represents either loss or gain . in principle the loss and gain regions can be carefully configured so that @xmath8 is @xmath0 symmetric , that is @xmath9 .",
    "propagation through such a medium exhibits many new and interesting properties , such as nonreciprocal diffraction @xcite and birefringence @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of complex optical lattices is the non - conservation of the total power . in the @xmath0-symmetric case",
    "this can lead to effects such as power oscillations @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that one can distinguish three universal dynamics @xcite related to broken or unbroken symmetry . while this is in general true",
    ", the behaviour can be modified considerably for special initial conditions , as we will discuss in the present paper .",
    "many familiar effects such as bloch oscillations and dynamical localisation get drastically modified in the presence of imaginary potentials and @xmath0-symmetry @xcite .",
    "the new features of complex optical lattices provide exciting opportunities for engineering applications . as an example",
    ", the possibility of realizing unidirectional light propagation has been envisaged @xcite . in the case of high intensities",
    "the propagation equation ( [ opteq ] ) gets modified due to the kerr - nonlinearity , leading to an additional term proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the influence of the nonlinearity on the non - reciprocal effects can be advantageous for applications such as unidirectional couplers .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nonlinear propagation equation also has a counterpart in quantum dynamics , as the mean - field description of bose - einstein condensates , where there has also been interest in @xmath0 symmetric models @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper , we shall limit ourselves to the linear case .    a model system exemplifying some of the novel features of beam propagation in @xmath0-symmetric optical lattices uses the sinusoidal potential [ vsin ] v = v_0  .",
    "this model has been studied numerically and theoretically , e.g. in refs .",
    "the propagation in @xmath5 of the amplitude @xmath6 is governed by the analogue schrdinger equation ( [ opteq ] ) , which for an eigenstate of @xmath11 , with eigenvalue @xmath12 and @xmath5-dependence @xmath13 reduces to the eigenvalue equation [ h ] --v_0=  .",
    "these eigenvalues are real for @xmath2 , which corresponds to unbroken @xmath0 symmetry , where the eigenfunctions respect the ( anti - linear ) symmetry of the hamiltonian . above @xmath4 pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues begin to appear , and indeed above @xmath14 all the eigenvalues are complex@xcite",
    ". clearly one would expect oscillatory behaviour of the amplitude below the threshold at @xmath4 and exponential behaviour above the threshold , but the precise form of the evolution at @xmath4 is less obvious . at first sight",
    "one would expect linear growth ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) because of the appearance of jordan blocks associated with the degenerate eigenvalues that merge at that value of @xmath15 , but , as longhi@xcite has emphasized , this behaviour can be significantly modified depending on the nature of the initial wave packet .",
    "it is this problem that we wish to discuss in the present paper . in section 2",
    "we explicitly construct the bloch wave - functions and the associated jordan functions corresponding to the degenerate eigenvalues and then use the analogue of the method of stationary states to construct the @xmath5-dependence .",
    "we find that the explicit linear dependence arising from the jordan associated functions is indeed cancelled by the combined contributions from the non - degenerate wave - functions ( which individually give an oscillatory behaviour ) . in section 3",
    "we analyze this cancellation in detail , showing how the coefficients of the two contributions are closely related , and obtaining an approximate analytic expression for the @xmath5-derivative of their sum .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "at the threshold @xmath4 , the potential @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ vsin ] ) becomes the complex exponential @xmath16 , for which the schrdinger equation reads [ h1 ] --v_0(2ix / a)= .",
    "this is a form of the bessel equation , as can be seen by the substitution @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , giving [ bessel ] y^2+y-(y^2+q^2)=0 , where @xmath19 .",
    "thus the spectrum is that of a free massive particle , shown in the reduced zone scheme in fig .  1 , and for @xmath20 not an integer the solutions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are linearly independent , and have exactly the correct periodicity , @xmath23 , to be the bloch wave - functions .",
    "it is important to note , however , that because the original potential is @xmath0-symmetric rather than hermitian , these functions are not orthogonal in the usual sense , but rather with respect to the @xmath0 inner product ( see eq .",
    "( [ orthogonality ] ) ) .",
    "however , for @xmath24 , a non - zero integer , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are no longer independent , but are in fact equal , signalling the degeneracy of the eigenvectors at those points , and the formation of spectral singularities and jordan blocks . in that case",
    "the bloch eigenfunctions do not form a complete set , and we must search for other functions , still with the same periodicity , to supplement them .",
    "these are the jordan associated functions ( see appendix and refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which we denote by @xmath27 , defined not by the eigenvalue equation itself , but by [ jordan ] _",
    "n(y)=i_n(y ) , and the periodicity condition @xmath28 , corresponding to the bloch periodicity @xmath29 . a particular solution of this equation , which can be expressed explicitly in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions , is given by [ particular ] _",
    "n^pi(y)=_y_0^y i_n(z ) , as is easily checked by differentiation and use of the wronskian identity @xmath30 .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath31 has a discontinuity in its imaginary part at @xmath32 and does not have the required periodicity .",
    "this problem can be rectified by recognizing that we may add to @xmath33 any multiple of @xmath25 , or more importantly @xmath34 .",
    "the latter displays exactly the same kind of discontinuity has a branch cut along the negative real axis , and when @xmath35 passes through @xmath36 one should really go to the next riemann sheet . ] as @xmath33 , and by choosing its coefficient judiciously the discontinuities can be made to cancel . specifically ,",
    "we take [ fixed ] _",
    "n(y)=_n^pi(y)-k_n(y ) . an alternative derivation of this relation using the definition of @xmath37 in terms of @xmath38 will be given in the next section .",
    "with the addition of the last term the resulting @xmath37 is not only free of discontinuities , but also obeys the correct bloch periodicity condition .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 , where we plot the real and imaginary parts of @xmath31 and @xmath37 for @xmath39 .",
    "note the @xmath0 symmetry of @xmath37 , namely @xmath40 .",

    "thus , in addition to the usual phase factors making up the sum for the time - dependent wave - function , one has an explicit factor of @xmath56 multiplying the degenerate eigenfunctions associated with a jordan block , giving the complete time dependence of the initial wave - function of eq .",

    "however , longhi@xcite has shown numerically and in perturbation theory that this linear dependence may not be realized , depending on the nature of the initial wave - function . since we now have explicit expressions for the bloch and jordan functions we are in a position to investigate the origin of this phenomenon in the context of the method of stationary states .",
    "we will take as our input a gaussian profile of the form [ gaussian ] ( x,0)=f(x)e^-(x / w)^2+i k_0 x , with offset @xmath60 and width @xmath61 . because of the periodicity of the bloch eigenfunctions and jordan associated functions the range of the integral in eqs .",

    "in this section we investigate in detail how the contributions from the other ( non - jordan ) eigenfunctions conspire to cancel out the explicit linear growth in @xmath5 coming from the jordan sector .",
    "a priori such a cancellation seems highly unlikely , but since it does occur it must be because the two sets of contributions are in fact closely connected .",
    "mathematically the cancellation can not be complete , but can only happen only over a limited range in @xmath5 . however , that is sufficient for the physical situation , because our lattice is finite in the @xmath35 direction , and at very large values of @xmath5 the beam will have encountered the edges of the lattice .    we now show that the contributions of the jordan block and of the nearby eigenfunctions are indeed closely related .",
    "we will consider specifically the first case of the previous section , where the jordan mode @xmath87 is excited .    recall that @xmath94 is expanded as ( x,0)=c_0 _ 0(x)+_kn / a c_k _",

    "the upper limit of the sum is infinity , but in practice it can be taken less than @xmath64 .",
    "note that if @xmath106 were continuous the limit of the second term as @xmath108 would be twice the first term , which comes from the jordan function .",
    "it turns out that although @xmath109 does exhibit the expected linear behaviour in @xmath5 initially , it subsequently@xmath109 has an extremely wide and flat plateau before it eventually rises again as @xmath5 approaches @xmath110 .",

    "a hint of such a plateau - like behaviour can be seen in the simple function @xmath112 , which is plotted in fig .",

    "the second argument of @xmath113 is small , so that for moderate values of @xmath5 we can approximate @xmath113 by 1 , in which case the behaviour is dominated by the preceding gaussian , which rapidly falls from 1 to a very small value , corresponding to the plateau in @xmath121 .",
    "the gaussian is eventually overwhelmed by the hyperbolic cosines occurring in the expansion of @xmath113 , as must be the case , since @xmath113 is periodic in @xmath5 .",
    "the plot of this function is given in fig .",
    "on general grounds one expects linear growth of the amplitude @xmath6 at the symmetry - breaking threshold @xmath4 , due to the degeneracy of a subset of the eigenfunctions at this point and the consequent development of jordan blocks .",
    "however , it has been observed numerically@xcite that this growth becomes saturated at large @xmath5 , at least for wide input beams .",
    "we have been able to explain this saturation phenomenon by analyzing in detail the separate contributions from the jordan blocks and the contributions from the nearby bloch functions in which they are embedded .    for the particular potential considered here ,",
    "the bloch eigenfunctions are associated bessel functions of the first kind , @xmath122 , and we were able to explicitly construct the associated jordan functions at the exceptional points @xmath24 .",
    "hence we were in a position to use the analogue of the method of stationary states to generate the @xmath5 dependence . in this method",
    "we were able to isolate the separate contributions of the jordan blocks from the other non - degenerate states with normal @xmath5 dependence generated by multiplying each eigenfunction by its appropriate @xmath5-dependent phase .",
    "we found that , in cases where the associated jordan functions are excited ( fig .",
    "3 ) the explicit linear increase of the jordan - block contributions is precisely compensated by a linear decrease of the contribution of the non - degenerate states , which of course have no _ explicit _ linear @xmath5-dependence . in cases where the jordan associated functions are not excited ( fig .",
    "4 ) , there is no initial linear increase , but rather a rapid oscillatory behaviour followed by a very slow decrease .",
    "the topology of the beams in these two cases is markedly different . in the first case , although the maximum amplitude becomes constant , the beam spreads laterally in a linear fashion , and hence the total power grows linearly , with the beam taking energy from the lattice . in the second case",
    "the total power turns out to be constant for large @xmath5 , with the slow decrease in the maximum amplitude being matched by the slow broadening of the individual beams .",
    "we then examined in detail the mechanism of saturation , which is only possible because of the close relation between the contribution of the jordan block and the contributions of the bloch functions in which it is embedded . with the aid of a certain amount of approximation",
    "we were able to write the respective contributions in the relatively simple form of eq .",
    "( [ flat ] ) and to express its @xmath5-derivative as a @xmath113 function .",
    "this @xmath113 function encodes the initial increase and the subsequent extremely wide and flat plateau . as a mathematical function",
    "it also encodes further steps and plateaux for larger @xmath5 , but these are not physically relevant because they correspond to values of @xmath35 outside the range of the finite lattice .",
    "since the references for jordan associated functions are not readily accessible , we give here a brief outline of their main properties .",
    "they are the analogue of the jordan associated vectors that occur in simple matrix eigenvalue problems of the form ( h-)u=0 where @xmath11 is non - hermitian . for hermitian problems , while two eigenvalues @xmath123 and @xmath124 may become degenerate at a particular critical value of a parameter in the hamiltonian , there remain two distinct eigenvectors . however , in the non - hermitian case it is possible that the eigenvectors also become degenerate : @xmath125 .",
    "the reduction in the number of eigenvectors at such a point means that the set of eigenvectors no longer forms a complete basis .",

    "the independent vector @xmath129 needed to complete the basis is indeed a solution ( undetermined up to a multiple of @xmath130 ) of the generalized eigenvalue equation [ v ] ( m-)v = u  .",
    "the eigenvectors of a non - hermitian matrix are not orthogonal in the usual sense .",
    "instead one needs to introduce the left eigenvectors @xmath131 , satisfying @xmath132 , which are different from the usual ( right ) column vectors satisfying @xmath133 .",
    "the orthogonality is then between left and right eigenvectors : @xmath134 for distinct eigenvalues @xmath123 and @xmath124",
    ". when the eigenvectors become degenerate , they are self - orthogonal .",
    "this is exemplified by the jordan matrix @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) , whose left and right eigenvectors are @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively , which are indeed orthogonal .",
    "it is easy to show in general that the associated vectors @xmath138 are orthogonal in the same sense to eigenvectors @xmath139 and associated vectors @xmath140 belonging to different eigenvalues . in the event that @xmath11 has a @xmath0 symmetry , for some definition of the reflection operator @xmath141 , all of these overlaps",
    "can instead be expressed in terms of right eigenvectors alone with the aid of the @xmath0 metric .",
    "the continuum analogue of this situation is the eigenvalue problem ( h - e_n)_n=0 where @xmath11 is a non - hermitian differential operator with eigenvalue @xmath142 and ( right ) eigenfunction @xmath143 .",

    "( [ v ] ) , the basis can be completed by inclusion of the jordan associated functions @xmath146 ( generalized eigenfunctions ) , defined by the generalized eigenvalue equation ( h - e_n)_n=_n  .",
    "this is precisely how the jordan functions were introduced in eq .",
    "( [ jordan ] ) .",
    "they are defined only up to multiples of solutions of the homogeneous equation and are guaranteed to be orthogonal , using the @xmath0 metric , to each other and to eigenfunctions belonging to other eigenvalues .",
    "we found it necessary to exploit this freedom in eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) in order to ensure that the @xmath146 satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "an alternative definition of the jordan functions is as derivatives of the eigenfunctions with respect to the energy@xcite .",
    "thus , differentiating the eigenvalue equation @xmath147 with respect to @xmath148 we get precisely ( h - e)-=0  , so that we may identify @xmath149 with @xmath150 , again modulo solutions of the homogeneous equation .",
    "in our present problem this latter definition leads to extremely simple formulae for the functions @xmath52 .",
    "for example , using eq .",
    "( 9.6.44 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite it yields @xmath151 , which is easily seen to be a solution of eq .",
    "( [ jordan ] ) with the correct periodicity .",
