    "the cold dark matter paradigm for the formation of structure in the universe has met with considerable success in describing both the large scale distribution of matter in our universe ( bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 , percival et al .",
    "2001 , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and the structure of galaxies and galaxy clusters ( see for example klypin , zhao & somerville , 2002 , kneib et al . 2003 ; although potential discrepancies remain , see for example weldrake , de blok & walter 2003 , sand et al .",
    "2004 ) . in recent years",
    ", high resolution n - body simulations have demonstrated that a record of the hierarchical merging process through which dark matter haloes form in such cosmologies is preserved in the form of substructure within haloes ( moore et al .",
    "1999 , klypin et al . 1999 ,",
    "springel et al . 2001 ) . when a small halo merges into a large , `` host '' , system it is not immediately destroyed , but instead begins to orbit within the host , gradually losing mass due to the actions of tidal forces .",
    "these substructures are presumably the locations of galaxies in clusters and of dwarf galaxies in the local group ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 , bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 , somerville 2002 , benson et al .",
    "the properties and evolution of substructures have been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "the distribution of halo masses and the distribution of substructures throughout the host are now well studied ( though that is not to say agreed upon ) through both n - body and semi - analytical means ( ghigna et al .",
    "2000 , de lucia et al .",
    "2004 , gao et al .",
    "2004 , taylor & babul 2004 ) .",
    "although substantial computational efforts have been made to analyse the present distribution of substructures in dark matter haloes , the subject still lacks detailed theoretical studies that explore the main processes that drive the evolution of those systems .",
    "in particular , one aspect of substructure evolution that has not been examined in detail is the interactions between substructures .",
    "although such interactions are self - consistently included in n - body simulations their importance has not been assessed , while previous semi - analytical calculations have ignored interactions between substructures galaxy cluster , but did not assess in detail the importance of these mergers .",
    "somerville & primack ( 1999 ) also allowed for the possibility of mergers between substructures in their semi - analytic model of galaxy formation .",
    "note that neither of these studies addressed the questions we are interested in here , namely the effects of substructure  substructure _ encounters _ as opposed to mergers . ] .",
    "these encounters are an additional source of heating for substructures , thereby altering their rate of mass loss , and also change the distribution of substructure orbits ( and therefore their spatial distribution ) .    in this work",
    "we examine whether dynamical evolution occurring within the host halo alters the present distribution of dark matter substructures .",
    "we use a semi - analytic model that implements the main dynamical processes acting on substructures : dynamical friction , gravitational scattering , gravitational heating and mass loss . semi - analytic codes have several advantages over n - body calculations : ( i ) they allow us to isolate the effects of each phenomena , ( ii ) they do not suffer from resolution limitations and ( iii ) they require fewer computational resources . however , these codes are based on analytic approximations to complex dynamical processes .",
    "this inevitably limits the accuracy of such codes .",
    "however , such models have been shown to provide a good description for substructures in cosmological dark matter haloes ( taylor & babul 2004 , benson et al .",
    "we will quantify how the neglect of substructure - substructure interactions impacts upon the results of such models .",
    "ultimately , the question that we are attempting to answer in this work is the following : is the present distribution of substructures driven by physical processes acting in the host halo ( in the sense that the orbits of those systems are strongly altered by dynamical processes ) , or , alternatively , does their distribution reflect their orbital properties at the time of accretion ?",
    "the answer to that question is , for instance , of great importance for observational surveys of satellite galaxies , which use these bodies as a direct indicator of the properties of the host haloes and the dark matter environment ( e.g. prada et al .",
    "2003 , sales & lambas 2004 ) . in that sense , knowing whether dynamical effects are important for the substructure distribution could help understand whether such effects can significantly alter the properties of observed satellite galaxies .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in  [ sec : init_distrib ] we describe how we generate host haloes and their population of infalling substructures . in ",
    "[ sec : sac ] we describe the semi - analytic code used to evolve the substructures . in ",
    "[ sec : calc ] we describe the calculations carried out in this work .",
    "we first show an illustrative study of the substructure - substructure encounters that these systems suffer during their evolution .",
    "we then analyse the evolution of the density profile and the orbit of substructures and examine how dynamical friction , gravitational scattering and mass loss affect the present spatial and mass distribution of substructures .",
    "we also examine the evolution of the substructure mass function .",
    "lastly , in  [ sec : concl ] we summarise our results .",
    "we generate initial conditions for our semi - analytical calculations by constructing merger trees for a sample of dark matter haloes identified at @xmath3 . specifically , we begin with dark matter haloes of mass @xmath4 , similar to that of the milky way ( klypin , zhao & somerville 2002 ) .",
    "we then apply the methods of cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to construct the merging history of this halo back to high redshift . for this calculation",
    "we assume a @xmath5cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , together with an inflationary initial power spectrum ( i.e. @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) . at each point in time , we identify the most massive progenitor of the @xmath3 halo and classify this as the `` host '' halo at that redshift .",
    "we then identify haloes which are about to merge with the host at each time and label these as new satellites .    at each point in time , we record the virial mass , virial velocity and concentration of the host halo ( which is assumed to have an nfw density profile ) .",
    "we also record the same information for each satellite along with the epoch of each merging event .",
    "we select an initial orbit for each satellite according to the method of benson ( 2004)specifically , the initial position is chosen at random on the surface of a sphere with radius equal to the current virial radius of the host halo , while the initial velocity is chosen from the distribution found by benson ( 2004 ) for @xmath3 in @xmath5cdm cosmologies .    in this way",
    "we generate both the formation history of the host halo and the properties of the infalling population of satellites .",
    "these are used as inputs to our model for the evolution of substructures .",
    "we generate a sample of nine such milky way - like haloes , which have @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total mass of the host halo , including the mass enclosed in dark matter substructures . in fig .",

    "it is interesting to note that both the mass and the virial radius of haloes grow almost linearly with time on average until the present epoch .    for each realization in our sample",
    ", a different merger tree is defined . in fig .",
    "[ fig : merger ] we show the number of substructures merging with the host halo per unit time ( upper - left panel ) and the cumulative number of merging events during one hubble time ( upper - right panel ) .",
    "both panels show that the merging rate has slowed down since the early formation of the host halo .",
    "each substructure has associated with it a virial mass . in the lower panels we plot the mass fraction @xmath15 , which is defined as the mass enclosed in substructures , normalised to @xmath16 ,",
    "which is accreted per unit time ( lower - left panel ) and the cumulative mass fraction ( lower - right panel ) as a function of time .",
    "this last quantity accounts for the mass gain of the host halo as a result of substructure mergers and , as we can see , ranges from 0.30.7 at @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , despite the decrease in the number of mergers , the cumulative mass fraction shows an approximately linear growth owing to the larger masses of the late - time merging substructures . for this plot",
    ", we consider only those substructures with @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the mass fraction enclosed in subhaloes barely depends on the arbitrary minimum mass selected here since @xmath15 is principally determined by a relatively low number of fairly massive substructures , in particular by those with @xmath18 ( see section  [ sec : mass ] ) , where @xmath19 is the merging time . in order to obtain a better understanding of the complex processes acting on dark matter substructures during their evolution we inject two control substructures in the initial sets with orbital and internal properties at their merging time @xmath20 selected _",

    "we assume that the host halo , as well as the dark matter substructures , follow an nfw density profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 )    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is a constant and @xmath27 is the halo scale length .",

    "the presence of @xmath33 substructures will perturb the orbits that dark matter substructures would follow in a smooth potential . to estimate the perturbation we perform a simple force summation , so that the specific force acting on the @xmath34 substructure is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the _ softening parameter _ of the @xmath37 substructure which accounts for its finite extent .",

    "several studies of satellite orbital decay have shown that , in spherical systems , chandrasekhar s formula for dynamical friction ( chandrasekhar 1943 ) is sufficiently accurate if the coulomb logarithm is treated as a free parameter to fit to n - body data ( e.g. van den bosch et al .",
    "1999 , colpi et al .",

    "2004 ) and , therefore , represent a useful tool for conducting extensive studies of a large parameter space .",

    "subsequently , we apply a leap - frog integration of the orbit at each time - step .",
    "substructures experience mass loss whenever the external tidal field is sufficiently strong .",
    "mass which becomes unbound can subsequently escape from the satellite .",
    "depending on the rate of change of the external tidal field as seen along the satellite orbit , we can distinguish between slow and rapid regimes : tidal limitation and tidal heating , respectively .",
    "in the first regime , the unbound mass is determined by the tidal radius ( king 1962 ) , which is defined for a spherically symmetric satellite as the distance from the satellite centre at which the force due to the satellite s self - gravity and the external tidal force balance .",
    "if the satellite follows a circular orbit , the system can be considered as static in a rotating frame , and one can estimate the tidal radius as ( king 1962 ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angular velocity of the satellite and @xmath52 the potential of the host halo .    this approximation is valid when : ( i ) the substructure mass is much smaller than that of the host halo and ( ii ) @xmath53 is small compared to the distance to the centre of the host halo ( @xmath54 ) . even under these conditions , the mass within @xmath53 is not exactly equal to the bound mass , since there may be particles that have ( small ) positive energy and stay in transient orbits within the satellite ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "furthermore , some particles at smaller radii , which nevertheless have orbits which take them to larger radii , can become unbound ( kampakoglou & benson , in preparation ) .",
    "if the satellite follows a non - circular orbit one can still use eq .",

    "the mass loss is most rapid near peri - centre where the tidal force is greatest ( e.g. , pearrubia , kroupa & boily 2002 , piatek & pryor 1995 ) . in our calculations ,",
    "the effects of transient orbits are assumed to be negligible compared to the total amount of mass stripped out by the peri - galacticon passages .    whereas eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rt ] ) is quite accurate in accounting for the mass loss induced by tidal forces from the host halo , close encounters between dark matter clumps may enhance the mass stripping process by heating ( i.e. expanding ) these systems .",
    "such collisions occur on time - scales short compared to the orbital period and can be treated as tidal shocks .",
    "satellites travelling through regions where the external potential changes rapidly suffer tidal shocks .",
    "this process can be modelled as a perturbation , with a particular frequency spectrum , that adds energy to the satellite particles .",
    "gnedin & ostriker ( 1999 ) show that , as a result of the shock , the satellite is contracted , with subsequent expansions and re - contractions until it reaches a final state of equilibrium , in which the binding energy is reduced compared to the original value and the satellite has expanded .",
    "this non - equilibrium phase lasts , in their models , for around 20 satellite dynamical times .",
    "the detailed study of tidal shocks is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "this result favours our semi - analytic calculation of substructure orbits since relative forces along non - overlapping collisions can be accurately reproduced by interactions of point - masses .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the substructure following an eccentric orbit has suffered around 33% more encounters than that following a circular one .",

    "the total angular momentum of systems orbiting in isotropic potentials is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "if only dynamical friction is implemented , the angular momentum decreases as a consequence of the drag force , whereas if only scattering is implemented substructures can gain or lose angular momentum depending on the characteristics of the two - body encounters occurring during their evolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angmom ] we plot the fraction of substructures as a function of their angular momentum variation .",
    "the dotted line , calculation c2 ( i.e. switching on dynamical friction ) shows that the effect of the smooth dark matter component is practically negligible , since fewer than 1% of the surviving substructures have suffered a measurable angular momentum loss .",
    "this result is fully in agreement with that of zhao ( 2004 , ) who , on the basis of semi - analytical calculations of satellite orbits in a growing host potential , conclude that the effects of dynamical friction are suppressed by mass loss . on the contrary , the effects of substructure - substructure interactions ( calculation c3 ; dashed line ) on individual orbits of dark matter clumps",

    ", the averaged angular momentum remains practically unaltered since the time of their merging .",
    "we have also determined how the mass evolution of substructures affects their present distribution .",
    "we find that mass loss effects are much more important than those induced by dynamical friction and scattering .",
    "mass loss processes decrease the maximum mass expected for substructures at the present day from @xmath150 down to @xmath151values in fairly good agreement with those reported by gao et al .",
    "we find that the mass contribution of disrupted substructures to the present day halo mass is around 22% , whereas only @xmath152 is still enclosed in form of bound substructures .",
    "the present mass fraction in subhaloes mostly originates from a relatively low number of massive substructures ( @xmath153 $ ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the mass fraction is barely dependent on the mass resolution .",
    "these results agree fairly well with those of van den bosch et al .",
    "lastly we find that , on average , substructures lose around 4060% of their mass by the present day , independent of their initial mass .",
    "this explains the low sensitivity of the mass function slope to mass loss processes .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the present distribution of substructures is mainly determined by the merger tree and the mass evolution of these systems , whereas dynamical friction and gravitational scattering play a negligible role .",
    "these results are also important for understanding the present mismatch between cdm predictions and observations of satellite galaxies : + ( i ) * the missing satellite problem*. the apparent overestimation in the number of satellite galaxies ( e.g klypin , kravtsov & valenzuela 1999 ) can not be explained by evolutionary processes within the host galaxy .",
    "the suggestion that dynamical friction or scattering may strongly enhance the disruption of substructures by driving them to the inner regions of the galaxy can be discarded .",
    "+ ( i ) * the holmberg effect*. the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies ( holmberg 1969 , zaritsky & gonzlez 1999 , sales & lambas 2004 ) , where most appear to follow nearly polar orbits out to 500 kpc , can not be explained by dynamical processes acting within the host halo .",
    "another interesting consequence of our results is that satellite galaxies beyond @xmath154 kpc with masses @xmath155 have adiabatic invariants that have not been altered by dynamical processes acting within the host galaxy .",
    "thus , these objects retain their orbital properties which are determined _ a priori _ by the intergalactic environment . although we must keep in mind that observational surveys are usually biased towards massive satellite galaxies , which may present some degree of dynamical evolution ( in particular we find that subhaloes with @xmath156 show a decrease of their initial angular momentum of around 2530% on average )",
