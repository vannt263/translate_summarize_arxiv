    "this paper is devoted to the existence and the uniqueness of global subsonic flows for the euler equations for steady irrotational compressible fluids .",
    "our focus is on the global subsonic flows in a general multi - dimensional infinite nozzle , which is an important subject in gas dynamics ( see @xcite @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "consider the steady isentropic compressible euler equations [ euler ] \\ { &   ( u ) = 0,& , + &  ( uu ) + p=0,& , .where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 represent the density , velocity , and the pressure of the fluid , respectively .",
    "moreover , the pressure @xmath9 is a smooth function of @xmath6 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "it is easy to derive the following so - call bernoulli s law @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the enthalpy , defined by @xmath15 .",
    "the relation ( [ bernoulli ] ) implies that the quantity @xmath16 , named bernoulli s function , remains constant along the stream line in a steady isentropic flow .",
    "if , in addition , the flow is assumed to be irrotational , ie .",
    "the vorticity of the flow velocity @xmath17 then there exists a velocity potential function @xmath18 , at least locally , such that @xmath19 in this case , the relation ( [ bernoulli ] ) simplifies to the following strong version of the bernoulli s law [ strongber ] b ( , ||^2 ) = ( ||^2+h())=0 . this yields a density - speed relation for steady irrotational flows . therefore , the density @xmath6 can be determined by the speed @xmath20 , denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "then the steady euler equations ( [ euler ] ) are reduced to the following well - known scaler potential equation [ potential ] ( ( ||^2))=0 ,   .",
    "one of the most important parameters to the fluid dynamics is the _ mach number _ , which is defined as a non - dimensional ratio of the fluid velocity to local sound speed , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the local sound speed .",
    "mathematically , the second - order nonlinear equation ( [ potential ] ) is elliptic in the subsonic region , ie . @xmath24 and hyperbolic in the supersonic region where @xmath25 .",
    "subsonic flows are those in which the local velocity speed is smaller than sonic speed everywhere , i.e. the mach number of the flow is less than @xmath26 .",
    "since the corresponding equations of subsonic flows possess some elliptic properties , problems related to subsonic flows are , in general , have extra - smoothness to those related to transonic flows or supersonic flows .",
    "there are many literatures in this field in the past decades .",
    "the first result is due to frankl and keldysh @xcite .",
    "they studied the subsonic flows around a 2d finite body ( or airfoil ) and proved the existence and the uniqueness for small data by the method of successive approximations .",
    "later on , bers @xcite@xcite proved the existence of subsonic flows with arbitrarily high local subsonic speed for the chaplygin gas ( minimal surface ) . by a variational method , shiffman @xcite@xcite proved that , if the infinite free stream flow speed @xmath27 is less than some critical speed , there exists a unique subsonic potential flow around a given profile with finite energy .",
    "shortly afterwards , bers @xcite improved the uniqueness results of shiffman .",
    "finn and gilbarg @xcite proved the uniqueness of the 2d potential subsonic flow about a bounded obstacle with given circulation and velocity at infinity .",
    "all above the results are related to two dimensional problems . for three ( or higher ) dimensional case ,",
    "finn and gilbarg @xcite proved the existence , uniqueness and the asymptotic behavior with implicit restriction on mach number @xmath28 .",
    "payne and weinberger @xcite improved their results soon after . later , dong @xcite extended the results of finn and gilbarg @xcite to any mach number @xmath29 and to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , dong and ou extended the results of shiffman to higher dimensions by the direct method of calculus of variations and the standard hilbert space method .",
    "all results as above ( including @xcite-@xcite ) are related to the subsonic flows past a profile .",
    "another important problem is the study of subsonic flows is the theory of global subsonic flow in a variable nozzles as formulated by bers in @xcite :    [ op ] find @xmath18 such that , [ nozzle ] \\ {    ll ( ( ||^2 ) ) = 0 , &   , +   = 0 , &   , + _ s_0(||^2)ds = m_0>0 , & +     .",
    "where @xmath30 is an infinitely long nozzle , @xmath31 is the mass flux passing through the nozzle , @xmath32 is an arbitrary cross section of the nozzle , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the unit outer normal of the domain @xmath35 and @xmath32 , respectively ( please see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .     +    in the famous survey @xcite , bers claimed without proof the unique solvability of sufficiently slow subsonic irrotational flows in two dimensional channel .",
    "the rigorous proof of this fact was achieved mathematically recently by xie and xin @xcite .",
    "they established a very complete , satisfactory and systematic theory for the two dimensional subsonic flows in an infinitely long nozzle for potential flows , which not only solves the problem 1 in this case , but also yields the existence of subsonic - sonic flows in the nozzle as limits of subsonic flows .",
    "one of the key ideas in @xcite , is to use the stream function to formulate the problem to a quasilinear elliptic problem with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the benefit of the stream function formation of the problem is that , the stream function @xmath36 has a priori @xmath37 bound , and the flow region of two dimensional nozzle , though infinitely long , has finite `` width '' .",
    "so one can obtain the boundary @xmath37 estimate of the gradient of the stream function , @xmath38 , by constructing proper barrier functions and the standard comparison principle for subsolution to second order elliptic equation .",
    "similar approach has been applied in 3d axis - asymmetric nozzles by xie and xin in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these ideas are also useful to study the physically more important case , subsonic euler flows , by xie and xin in @xcite ( see also the generalization in @xcite ) .",
    "however , it seems difficult to apply the method in @xcite and @xcite in general multi - dimensional ( @xmath39 ) nozzles , since the stream function formulation can not work in this case .",
    "thus , we have to consider a different approach from that in @xcite to treat the subsonic problem in multi - dimension case .    on the other hand , since the domain of an infinitely long nozzle is differentiable homeomorphism to an infinitely long cylinder which is unbounded , the nozzle flow problems are different to the airfoil problems in which the domains are exterior domains .",
    "the main advantage of the exterior domain is that it can be transformed to a bounded domain through a kelvin - like transformation .",
    "then the airfoil problem can be transformed ( explicitly or implicitly ) to a scalar quasilinear elliptic problem with a bounded domain .",
    "this feature of the exterior domain plays an essential role in the previous airfoil results .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , a hardy - type inequality in the exterior domain is essential .",
    "but there is no similar hardy - type inequality for the domain of nozzle flows , which is the one of the main difficulties in our case . for more detailed discussions , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study subsonic flows in general multi - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) infinitely long nozzles .",
    "first , we formulate a subsonic truncated problem , which is a uniformly elliptic equation in a bounded domain .",
    "moreover , we prove the existence of the weak solution to the truncated problem by a variational method , and use the approximated variational problems in bounded domains to approximate the original problem [ op ] . to realize this procedure , some uniform estimates are needed to show that the approximated solutions converge to the ones of the original problem [ op ] .",
    "however , one can not expect to get the uniform boundary gradient estimate of @xmath18 by the classical barrier function argument , since the potential function @xmath18 is essentially unbounded , which is another main difficulty in this paper .",
    "the key observation here is that , though the potential function @xmath18 is unbounded , the @xmath40 average of @xmath41 is uniformly bounded ( see the estimate ( [ l ] ) ) .",
    "using this fact and the uniform ellipticity , we prove the `` local average estimate '' which states that the average estimate implies the local average of the gradient @xmath41 is uniformly bounded ( see ( [ eq - lae ] ) for details ) .",
    "that is , @xmath41 is locally @xmath40 bounded .",
    "then , it is easy to get the @xmath37 bound of @xmath41 by the standard moser iteration . with this key estimate of uniformly @xmath37 bound of @xmath41",
    ", we establish the existence of the subsonic flows in an infinitely long nozzle for arbitrary dimensions for suitable small incoming mass flux , including the two dimensional case in @xcite .",
    "next , we show that the global uniformly subsonic flow is unique . the proof is based on considering the linear equation satisfied be the difference of two solutions of the nonlinear potential equation .",
    "we prove the existence of the critical incoming mass flux for subsonic flows .",
    "finally , with the additional asymptotic assumptions on the nozzle at the far field , we obtain some asymptotic behaviors of the subsonic flow at the far field by a blow - up argument .    before stating the main results in this paper",
    ", we first give the following assumptions on the nozzle .",
    "* basic assumptions on @xmath35*. there exists an invertible @xmath42 map @xmath43 satisfying [ h1 ] \\ {    l t( ) = , + k ,  t(\\{x_n = k } ) = b(0,1)\\{y_n = k } , + t ,   k ,    . where @xmath44 is a uniform constant",
    ", @xmath45 is a unit cylinder in @xmath46 , @xmath47 is unit ball in @xmath48 centered at the origin , @xmath49 is the longitudinal coordinate .    ,",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] +    * nondimensionalization of the quantities . *",
    "it follows from bernoulli s law ( [ bernoulli ] ) that in a potential flow the density is a given function of speed .",
    "applying the fact ( @xcite , @xcite ) that there exists a critical speed @xmath52 such that the flow is subsonic if the speed is less than @xmath52 , we can introduce the nondimensional velocity and density as @xmath53 with an abuse of the notation , we still denote the nondimesional quantities by @xmath54 .",
    "then it is easy to check that @xmath55 for @xmath56 and that the flow is subsonic provided that @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "our main results in this paper are stated as follows .",
    "[ mainth ] suppose that the nozzle @xmath35 satisfies the basic assumptions ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "then    \\(i ) there exists a positive number @xmath59 depending only on @xmath35 , such that if @xmath60 , then there exists a uniformly subsonic flow through the nozzle , ie .",
    ", the problem [ op ] has a smooth solution @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a uniform constant independent of @xmath64 , and @xmath18 .",
    "\\(ii ) there exists a critical mass flux @xmath65 , which depends only on @xmath66 , such that if @xmath67 , then there exists a unique uniformly subsonic flow through the nozzle with the following properties    [ 1 ] q(m_0)=_x|||<1 , and @xmath68 ranges over @xmath69 as @xmath70 varies in @xmath71 .",
    "\\(iii ) furthermore , assume that the nozzle satisfies the asymptotic assumption ( [ aa ] ) , then the flow approaches the uniform flows at the far fields , ie . [ 2 ] = ( 0 , , q _ ) ,  x_n , respectively , with @xmath72 being constants determined uniquely by @xmath73 here @xmath74 represents the measure of the domain @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "+    in the first statement of theorem [ mainth ] , it follows from the proof in section 3 that one can derive an explicit form of @xmath59 , which depends only on the nozzle @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , it does not depend on the equation of the states . on the other hand , in the second statement of the theorem [ mainth ]",
    ", we just give the existence of the critical mass flux @xmath75 for a given infinite long nozzle .",
    "clearly , @xmath59 is a lower bound of @xmath75 .    in the proof of the uniqueness of uniformly subsonic flows , it is not necessary to require the asymptotic assumption ( [ aa ] ) on the nozzle .",
    "it is quite different from the strategy in @xcite for the 2d case , in which the proof of the uniqueness depends on the asymptotic behaviors of the uniformly subsonic flow in the far fields .",
    "however , in this paper , the uniqueness of the uniformly subsonic flow is obtained in arbitrary dimensional nozzle without the asymptotic assumption ( [ aa ] ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce some necessary preliminaries . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove the first statement of the theorem 1.1 .",
    "our strategy for the existence of subsonic flows with small incoming mass flux can be divided into six steps : step 1 , truncate the coefficients of the potential equation to guarantee the strong ellipticity and truncate the unbounded nozzle to a series of bounded domains @xmath76 , to formulate the approximated strong elliptic problems in bounded domains .",
    "step 2 , solve the approximate truncated problems by a direct variational method .",
    "step 3 , improve the regularity of the variational solutions to give the @xmath77 regularity .",
    "step 4 , prove the @xmath40 local average estimates to the gradient of the solutions . step 5 , obtain the classical @xmath78 estimate of the approximate solutions .",
    "step 6 , based on these key estimates , the existence of the subsonic solution to the nozzle problem for suitable small incoming mass flux is proved .",
    "the uniqueness of the uniformly subsonic solution is given in section 4 , while the existence of the critical value for incoming mass flux is obtained in section 5 .",
    "in the last section , we prove that the subsonic nozzle flows approach to the uniform flows at the far fields when the nozzle satisfies the asymptotic assumption ( [ aa ] ) .    in this paper , @xmath79 , @xmath80 always denote the variables in @xmath35 and @xmath81 respectively , @xmath18 denotes the function defined in @xmath35 and @xmath82 denotes the corresponding function defined in @xmath81 .",
