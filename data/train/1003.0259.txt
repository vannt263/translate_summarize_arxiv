    "in this study we suggest a new family of spherical mass distribution models that generalizes models by an & evans ( 2006 , hereafter ae ) and models by kuzmin et al . @xcite .",
    "the family depends on two structural parameters .",
    "it includes plummer s spheres @xcite , hnon s isochrones @xcite and the model by hernquist @xcite as special cases .",
    "let us consider the dimensionless potential @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are structural parameters . if @xmath3 , @xmath4 we obtain a model by ae , for @xmath5 , @xmath6 we have a model by kuzmin et al .",

    "poisson s equation yields the following expression for density @xmath7.\\ ] ] it follows from ( [ rho ] ) that our models with @xmath8 are cusped ( as models by ae are ) .",
    "the density profiles for different values of parameters are shown in figures [ raspopova - fig1 ] , [ raspopova - fig2 ] .",
    "the circular speed is found to be @xmath9",
    "a run of velocity dispersion @xmath10 can be found from an equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath11    the results of calculations for an isotropic velocity distribution ( @xmath12 ) are shown in figure [ raspopova - fig3 ] .",
    "central minima will appear in all models with density cusp .",
    "it can be obtained from ( [ phi ] ) that @xmath13^{1/p}}{\\alpha\\phi}.\\ ] ] then it is possible to find an augmented density @xmath14 and calculate an isotropic distribution function .",
    "stability of such models can be studied using the third antonov law @xcite , namely , if @xmath15 the model is stable against spherical perturbation .",
    "the validity of this inequality can be established after some laborious calculations .",
    "using the equipotential method by @xcite one can construct axisymmetric generalizations of the suggested model .",
    "we considered a potential of such models @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the same function as and @xmath18 is an equation of equipotential surfaces , @xmath19 , @xmath20 being cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we considered the equipotentials by @xcite : @xmath21 and by @xcite : @xmath22 here @xmath23 $ ] is a new structure parameter . for spherical systems @xmath24 .",
    "we found that for @xmath25 close to @xmath26 the density is positive for @xmath19 , @xmath20 everywhere .",
    "so we concluded that such non - spherical model can be used for approximating mass distribution in non - spherical star clusters and non - highly flattened galaxies .      an , j. h. , evans , n. w. 2006 , , 131 , 782 binney , j. , tremaine , s. 1987 , galactic dynamics , princeton univ . press , princeton hnon , m. 1959 , ann . dastrophys . , 22 , 126 hernquist , l. 1990 , , 356 , 359 kutuzov , s. a. , ossipkov , l.p .",
