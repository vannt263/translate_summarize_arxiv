    "in particular , for initial condition of type i , camassa  holm equation develops a singularity in a finite time of algebraic type 3/5 , weaker with respect to the cubic  root singularity developed by burgers equation @xcite , probably due to the presence of the dispersive terms . for initial condition of type ii , camassa  holm equation develops in a finite time singularity of algebraic type 2/3 , which is the behavior of the peakons solution for camassa  holm equation .    here",
