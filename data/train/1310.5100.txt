    "quantum computation by local measurements ( mbqc ) was shown to provide the same power of computation as the standard circuit model  @xcite .",
    "studying various aspects of this model also offers new perspectives and insights , such as improvement of the resource overhead in linear - optics quantum computation  @xcite , utilization of topological protection  @xcite , renormalization and holographic principles  @xcite , exploration of quantum computational phases of matter  @xcite and the relation to symmetries  @xcite and contextuality  @xcite .",
    "there are still several aspects in mbqc to be understood , such as complete characterization of universal resource states and whether they can arise as unique ground states of gapped two - body interacting hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "the cluster state on the square lattice was the first entangled state found to support universal mbqc  @xcite .",
    "later its generalization to graph states on many 2d regular lattices were shown to be universal  @xcite . moreover",
    ", even faulty lattices can also support graph states that are universal for mbqc  @xcite . given the success in graph states ,",
    "one is led to ask the question : how to characterize all universal resource states ?",
    "specifically , do there exit other families of states like graph states that provide such versatility for quantum computational universality ?",
    "common properties shared by members in such families can provide insight to the relation between computational universality and physical properties , possibly providing stepping stones towards complete characterization of resource states , which is currently lacking .    in the following we shall investigate the family of the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) states  @xcite and significantly expand known universal resource states in this family .",
    "similar to graph states , aklt states can be defined on any graph .",
    "in contrast to graph states composed uniformly of spin-1/2 entities , the local spin magntidue @xmath0 of the aklt states depend on the number @xmath1 of nearest neighboring sites , via @xmath2 ; see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the entanglement stucture of the aklt family is therefore different from that of the graph - state family .",
    "graph states do not arise as unique ground states of two - body interacting hamiltonians  @xcite , which might be a disadvantage from the viewpoint of creating universal resource states by cooling .",
    "a finite gap in the hamiltonian separating a unique resouce state as a ground state from excited states is thus a desirable feature  @xcite . with suitably chosen boundary conditions , aklt states are unique ground states of certain two - body interacting hamiltonians  @xcite ,",
    "some of which are believed to possess finite spectral gap  @xcite .    the insight why aklt states might be useful for mbqc originated from the study of the 1d spin-1 aklt state , shown to be capable of simulating one - qubit gates  @xcite .",
    "but the full quantum computational universality requires higher dimensions and was later established in the spin-3/2 aklt state on the honeycomb lattice and a couple of other trivalent lattices  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether the university of the spin-3/2 aklt state is fortuitous or there are other states , in particular ones with higher spins ( than 3/2 ) , that can provide universal resource for mbqc ?",
    "furthremore , understanding why some states in the family are useful while others are not can provide connection of quantum computational universality to other physical properties .    here",
    "we demonstrate that within the aklt family many states defined on various 2d lattices contain mixture of different spin entities ( such as spin @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and provide universal resources for mbqc .",
    "( we note that spin-1/2 entities can occur at the boundary of the lattice . )",
    "the universality of this family is richer than the cluster family .",
    "lattices possessing geometric frustration ( i.e. , loops with odd number of sites ) may not support universal resource states but they can be modified ( or decorated ) so that the associated aklt states are universal . the emerging picture from our study is the following .",
    "aklt states involving spin-2 and other lower spin entities are universal if they reside on a two - dimensional ( geometric ) frustration - free lattice with any combination of spin-2 , spin-3/2 , spin-1 and spin-1/2 ( consistent with the lattice ) , provided that spin-2 sites are not neighbors .",
    "the constraint that the spin-2 states are not neighbors is due to the open question that whether aklt states of uniform spin-2 entities can be universal , and it may be lifted if the anwser to that question is affirmative .",
    "we also note that , however , the existence of geometric frustration may not necessarily render the states non - universal , as we shall also demonstrate .",
    "the task of proving universality of higher - spin aklt states poses a greater challenge , as a straightforward extension of the generalized measurement or positive - operator - valued - measure measurement ( povm ) for the trivalent case does not work .",
    "additional elements must be introduced to complete the spin-2 povm  @xcite , and as a result the known reduction of the aklt states to graph states may no longer work .",
    "we shall provide a construction of spin-2 povm ( see eqs .",
    "( [ povmspin2 ] ) below ) that allows us to overcome this difficulty .",
    "we consider aklt states on a few lattices , some of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] , but the applicability of our method goes beyond these . for example , the lattice fig .  [",
    "fig : lattice]a can be regarded as modified from the square lattice by replacing in the checker - board pattern spin-2 sites with four spin-3/2 sites . on this lattice ,",
    "spin-2 sites do not reside as neighbors , but are surrounded by other spin-3/2 sites .",
    "spin-3/2 sites can be dealt easily with a povm composed of three directions ( x , y and z ) ; see eq .",
    "( [ povmspin32 ] )  @xcite .",
    "such modification makes the demonstration of the universality involving higher - spins possible via treating potential leakage errors on these sites . in a similar manner",
    "we shall also examine two other lattices ( figs .",
    "[ fig : lattice]b and c ) which support aklt states with mixture of spin-2 and spin-1 entities .",
    "moreover , we shall investigate the universality for the spin-2 aklt state on the kagome lattice ( fig .",

    "we have just described a procedure to deal with @xmath15 outcomes . however , in order to perform simulations to determine the computational universality , we need a method to sample @xmath28 s and @xmath16 s from the exact distribution according to the correlation in the aklt states . via exact sampling",

    "the exact sampling amounts to knowing the probability distribution of measuring pauli x / y on some subset of qubits in a graph state .",

    "fortunately , it turns out that we can avoid the exact sampling by considering the ` worst scenario ' and still demonstrate universality ( with unit probability ) for various aklt states .    using the 2-step viewpoint of @xmath16 s , we first sample povm outcomes according to @xmath28 s , which was solved in ref .  @xcite .",

    "if the graphs ( before deletion ) are in the supercritical phase , as the probability of deletion increases , there will be a clear signature of phase transition , beyond which no spanning cluster exists .    in order for universal quantum computation on graph states",
    ", the graph needs to possess a macroscopic number of traversing paths .",
    "this means that that the random graphs generated by our procedure need to reside inside the supercritical phase .",
    "sitting right at the percolation transition is not sufficient for universal mbqc .",
    "we have checked the for the size @xmath29 large enough , @xmath30 is unity for random graphs resulting from the procedure on the aklt states in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice]a - c . but checking just this is not sufficient for establishing universality , as this does not rule out that the possibility that the graphs are sitting at the transition point nor that the graphs may be close to one - dimensional - like structure or star graphs ( both being non - universal for mbqc ) .",
    "we have further performed site percolation simulation on the resultant graphs , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : perco]a - c .",
    "it is seen that the graphs after the above procedure reside in the supercritical phase ( with unit probability ) , even in the worst - case scenario .",
    "the significance of performing @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 simulations is therefore to first prove an existence of phase transition , justifying the separation of two distinct phases and therefore the existence of macroscopic numbers of traversing paths ( in particular at @xmath32 ) in the supercritical phase of percolation .",

    "here we argue that it is the case in the kagome lattice , but show that for both lattices , we can decorate them so as to obtain universal aklt states .      for the spin-2 only aklt states ,",
    "the worst - case scenario can not be directly applied , as all the sites in each domain have some probability to be flipped from @xmath19 to @xmath18 . however , even if we assume the _ best - case scenario _ , i.e. , without flipping @xmath19 s to @xmath18 s , the graphs from sampling only the @xmath28 s outcomes do not possess traversing paths for large enough lattice size .",
    "thus , the spin-2 aklt state on the kagome is not likely universal .",
    "we remark that what we have not ruled out is the possibility of other povms that might have enabled universal quantum computation .",
    "the main reason for the lack of universality is due to the antiferromagnetic property in the aklt state and the geometric frustration in the lattice . due to the frustration in a triangle , the povm outcomes with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can not appear , similar to the star lattice  @xcite",

    "therefore , the random graphs are not in the supercritical phase , implying non - universality for the original aklt state",

    "we have shown that many 2d hybrid aklt states ( see fig .  [ fig : lattice ] ) involving mixture of spin-2 and other lower - spin entities are also universal for mbqc .",
    "the results are nontrivial as they demonstrate that aklt states with higher spins than 3/2 can still be universal .",
    "we have also demonstrated that even though the spin-2 aklt state on the kagome lattice ( fig .",

    "moreover , the existence of geometric frustration does not necessarily destroy the universality , as demonstrated in spin-3/2 spin-1 hybrid aklt state on the decorated star lattice .",
    "the following picture on the universality of aklt states emerges : any 2d frustration - free lattice with any combination of spin-2 , spin-3/2 , spin-1 and spin-1/2 , except that spin-2 sites are not neighbors , will host a universal aklt state . to lift the constraint that the spin-2 sites are not neighbors",
    ", one would need to resolve the question question whether the spin-2 aklt state on the square lattice remain universal .",
