    "[ conclude ] .",
    "just as the performance of an accelerator experiment crucially depends on its luminosity , the particle physics reach of high - energy neutrino astronomy will depend on the incoming flux of cosmic neutrinos . here",
    "we will briefly review some of the arguments for various neutrino fluxes from cosmic accelerators .",
    "the spectrum of cosmic rays has been well measured up to energies near @xmath5 ev ( @xmath6 tev in the lab frame ) where the experiments become limited by poor statistics .",
    "the spectrum consists of a series of power laws which change at energies called to as the `` knee '' and `` ankle '' ( see fig .  [ rays ] ) .",
    "the standard process believed to be responsible for the observed spectrum of cosmic rays is the acceleration of charged particles via second - order fermi acceleration @xcite . in fermi s original paper on the subject",
    ", he proposed that cosmic rays were accelerated by reflecting off of time - varying magnetic fields associated with galactic clouds moving with randomly distributed velocities .",
    "although this process will statically accelerate charged particles , it does so very slowly , and is generally not capable of even countering the effects of energy losses by ionization and other processes .",
    "if instead we consider a compact region of dense plasma , however , the random motion of the matter and associated magnetic fields can be sufficient to accelerate charged cosmic rays to very high energies . although there is no strong evidence as of yet",
    ", it is likely that supernova remnants accelerate most of the cosmic rays up to the knee in the spectrum , occurring around @xmath7 ev , by this mechanism .",
    "a generic feature of fermi acceleration is a power - law spectrum , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy to which a cosmic ray source may accelerate particles can be estimated by a simple argument .",
    "first , we assume that to accelerate a proton to a given energy in a given magnetic field , the size of the accelerator must be larger than the gyroradius of the particle s orbit : @xmath10 this condition yields a maximum energy of @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lorentz factor of the cosmic accelerator . to produce cosmic rays with energies near the highest observed ( @xmath13 ev ) ,",
    "very compact objects are required . for the most compact objects",
    ", we can consider @xmath14 , or the schwartzchild radius of the object .",
    "for such a source , we find a maximum energy of @xmath15 with only micro - gauss galactic magnetic fields , we must turn to extragalactic sources to accelerate cosmic rays to energies above the eev - scale .",
    "extragalactic sources potentially capable of accelerating particles to such energies include the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "as protons are accelerated to very high energies in such sources , they may undergo photo - meson interactions with the surrounding radiation fields . in such interactions , both charged and neutral pions are produced",
    ". these pions then decay producing neutrinos and gamma - rays , respectively .",
    "this process essentially guarantees the existence of accompanying neutrinos and gamma - rays given the observed cosmic ray flux .",
    "alternatively , bounds can be placed on the cosmic neutrino flux by relating it to the cosmic ray spectrum . using this method , waxman and bahcall",
    "have placed a upper bound for each neutrino flavor @xcite , @xmath16 this assumes that the sources in question are optically thin , or transparent , to protons .",
    "if sources are optically thick to protons , howbever , the bound on the neutrino flux can only be based on gamma - ray observations by egret and is thus weaker by a factor of about 40 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if some sources were truly `` hidden '' , meaning neither nucleons nor photons could escape , no upper bound could be made on the corresponding neutrino flux . for a further discussion of these and similar arguments ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to the neutrino production from cosmic ray interactions in or near cosmic accelerators , ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays produce neutrinos during propagation over cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "protons of energy above a few times @xmath17 ev can scatter off of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons with a center - of - mass energy roughly equal to the resonance corresponding to the mass of the @xmath18-hadron ( 1.232 gev ) . again , both charged and neutral pions can be produced this way , yielding neutrinos and gamma - rays .",
    "the neutrino flux corresponding to this process is called the `` cosmogenic neutrino flux '' .",
    "unlike the flux of neutrinos from cosmic accelerators , the spectrum of cosmogenic neutrinos depends only on the spectrum of ultrahigh - energy protons and the distribution of their sources , and thus can be reliably calculated @xcite .",
    "the cosmogenic neutrino flux is often thought of as a `` guaranteed '' source of ultrahigh - energy neutrinos , assuming that the cosmic ray primaries at the highest observed energies are protons and not heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "there are ways in which neutrino fluxes larger than those described here could be produced .",
    "for example , in models of non - accelerator cosmic ray origins , _",
    "i.e. _ , models in which the highest - energy cosmic rays are produced in the decay or annihilations of superheavy objects . in such models , the resulting neutrino flux is not constrained by the arguments shown here .",
    "although such scenarios are certainly interesting , we will not consider them in this article .",
    "for further discussion on cosmic neutrino fluxes and their constraints , see ref .  @xcite .     and",
    "dotted for @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "note that after neutrino oscillations are considered , these fluxes will contain all three neutrino flavors ( @xmath20 ) in equal quantities .",
    "the figure was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=336 ]    throughout the remainder of this article , we will primarily consider two representative choices for the cosmic neutrino spectrum .",
    "the first is a flux equal to the bound set by waxman and bahcall , which we call the waxman - bahcall flux of eq .",
    "( [ wbbound ] ) .",
    "the second is the cosmogenic neutrino flux , as calculated in ref .",
    "these are each shown in figure  [ fluxes ] .",
    "to identify potential signatures of new physics in high - energy neutrino interactions , one must first understand the phenomenology predicted by the standard model . in particular , the features of charged and neutral current interactions between high - energy neutrinos and target nuclei .",
    "the standard model predicts the cross sections for neutrino - nucleon interactions , up to uncertainties in parton distribution functions at extremely small values of the momentum fraction @xmath21 , to energies beyond those probed by any planned neutrino telescopes @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will describe the experimental features predicted by the standard model in neutrino telescopes and air shower experiments .",
    "neutrino telescopes are essentially arrays of detectors distributed over a large volume of a cerenkov medium , such as water or ice",
    ". these detectors may be sensitive to optical cerenkov radiation , as are amanda - ii , icecube and antares , or radio , as is rice .",
    "we will focus on optical cerenkov detectors here , although the treatment of shower detection is quite easily generalized to include radio .",
    "muons produced in the charged current interactions of muon neutrinos can travel several kilometers through a detector medium producing a  track \" of cerenkov light which can be observed and accurately reconstructed by neutrino telescopes .    the rate of muon events observed in a large volume neutrino telescope is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the zenith angle of an event ( @xmath24 is vertically downgoing ) , @xmath25 is avogadro s number , @xmath26 is the flux of muon neutrinos ( per unit energy , per unit time , per solid angle ) , @xmath27 is the differential neutrino - nucleon cross section ( where @xmath28 is defined such that @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 is the survival probability of a neutrino travelling through the earth , @xmath31 is the effective area of the detector ( @xmath32 km@xmath33 for icecube ) , @xmath34 is the length of time observed and @xmath35 is either the muon range or the length of material ( _ i.e. _ ice ) between the detector and the earth s surface , whichever is smaller .",
    "the muon range is defined as the distance a muon propagates in the medium surrounding the detector before falling below a cutoff energy .",
    "the muon range is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the minimum muon energy required to produce an event .",
    "this value is selected to reduce the number of background events while retaining as many signal events as possible . in optical cerenkov",
    "neutrino telescopes , muons with energy as low as @xmath38 gev can be observed , although cuts well above this energy are often imposed when searching for high - energy neutrinos . in ice , @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite . for a pev muon in ice , and a 100 gev muon energy threshold ,",
    "the range is approximately 1.7 km . for muons with energies of 10 pev , 100 pev or 1 eev",
    ", the range increases to 7 , 13 and 18 km , respectively .",
    "thus for very energetic muon neutrinos , the target volume of the experiment becomes a long cylinder , rather than a box .",
    "this is particularly relevant for neutrinos coming from a direction near the horizon .    unlike in accelerator experiments ,",
    "the flux ( or luminosity ) of a cosmic neutrino beam may be unknown .",
    "therefore , simply counting the number of events will not provide sufficient information to measure a neutrino cross section . instead",
    ", information from the angular and energy distributions of events must be used @xcite . for a cross section of about @xmath41",
    "mb , a particle s interaction length as it travels through the earth is equal to the earth s diameter .",
    "this cross section is reached near @xmath42tev according to the standard model prediction .",
    "thus , as the neutrino - nucleon cross section is increased from its standard model value , the effect of absorption in the earth becomes more pronounced and fewer of the observed events will come from neutrinos travelling through the earth . a crude way to measure the neutrino - nucleon cross section could",
    ", therefore , be a comparison of the upgoing to downgoing ( or earth - skimming , etc . )",
    "events in a high - energy neutrino telescope .",
    "a more sophisticated analysis of the angular distribution of events as a function of energy would be more useful , however .",
    "in addition to muon tracks , neutrino telescopes are sensitive to electromagnetic and hadronic showers .",
    "these events can be produced by all three neutrino flavors in neutral current interactions , or in some charged current interactions .",
    "for example , electromagnetic showers are produced in the charged current interaction of an electron neutrino .",
    "the rate of shower events is calculated in an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ muonsrate ] ) , but the muon range , @xmath43 , together with the effective area , @xmath31 , are replaced by the effective volume of the detector .",
    "also , the shower s energy is given by @xmath44 for neutral current events and @xmath45 for electron neutrino charged current events .",
    "the minimum energy a shower must have to be observed by an optical cerenkov neutrino telescope is on the order of a few tev . for radio detectors ,",
    "the shower threshold is much higher , in the pev to eev range .",
    "finally , very large volume neutrino telescopes , such as icecube , are also capable of observing events uniquely associated with tau neutrinos .",
    "tau neutrinos which interact via charged current in the detector medium produce a shower and a charged tau lepton .",
    "below a few pev , the tau lepton s lifetime is sufficiently short that it decays producing a second shower essentially spatially coincident with the first one .",
    "such an event is indistinguishable from a single shower . at higher energies , however , the tau lifetime can be long enough to distinguish these two showers .",
    "for example , at 10 pev , a tau travels , on average , about 500 meters before decaying .",
    "if both showers occur within the detector volume , such an event is called a `` double bang '' , and is a clear signature of a tau neutrino @xcite .",
    "if the first of these showers occurs outside of the detector , with only the second shower being observed , the event is called a `` lollipop '' . here the observation of the shower with a minimum ionizing track ( produced by the tau ) constitutes the candy and the stick of the `` lollipop '' , respectively . again , this is a clear signature of a tau neutrino .",
    "standard cosmic accelerators produce neutrinos via charged pion decay ( see section  [ flux ] ) .",
    "pion decays produce flavors of neutrinos in the ratio @xmath46 . over the long baselines",
    "such neutrinos travel before reaching earth , neutrino oscillations modify this ratio to @xmath47 , or nearly equal quantities of all three flavors . considering only standard model neutrino interactions , these incoming flavor ratios can be translated to ratios of observed muon tracks , electromagnetic and hadronic showers and tau unique events @xcite . by measuring",
    "the ratios of these event types observed in icecube , the presence of interactions beyond the standard model may be tested .",
    "very high - energy cosmic neutrinos can occasionally interact with particles in the earth s atmosphere producing extended air showers observable in high - energy cosmic ray experiments such as agasa , hires or the next generation pierre auger observatory @xcite . although the characteristics of neutrino induced showers do , in principle , differ from those initiated by hadronic cosmic rays @xcite , significantly more hadronic showers are expected , thus making showers from neutrino primaries difficult to conclusively identify .",
    "primary particles which have a near - horizontal trajectory can provide an opportunity to distinguish neutrinos from hadronic events , however .",
    "in contrast to hadronic cosmic rays ( which interact in the top of the atmosphere ) , neutrino primaries have considerably smaller cross sections and thus interact with nearly equal probability throughout the atmosphere .",
    "if a shower is observed which was initiated deep inside of the atmosphere , it can be associated with a neutrino ( or other weakly interacting particle ) primary .",
    "for there to be sufficient column depth to make this distinction ( typically 3000 to 4000 g / cm@xmath33 is required ) , only primaries within about @xmath49 of the horizon can be considered @xcite .",
    "the class of cosmic ray events which can be associated with neutrino primaries are called `` deeply penetrating , quasi - horizontal showers '' .    to calculate",
    "the rate of neutrino induced deeply penetrating , quasi - horizontal showers in an air shower experiment , one must estimate the acceptance to neutrino detection .",
    "this quantity is essentially the effective target mass multiplied by the accessible solid angle .",
    "it is often given in units of km@xmath50 water equivalent steradians ( km@xmath50 we sr ) , where , for example , 1 km@xmath50 water equivalent would be the target mass contained in one cubic kilometer of water or ice .",
    "@xcite estimates the acceptance of the agasa experiment to deeply penetrating , quasi - horizontal showers to be 0.05 km@xmath50 we sr at @xmath51 gev , rising to 1.0 km@xmath50 we sr at @xmath52 gev and above .",
    "they estimate the acceptance of auger to be a factor of 20 , 20 and 50 larger than agasa at @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev , respectively .",
    "these estimates consider showers within 15@xmath54 of the horizon and with a maximum height of 15 kilometers . for a discussion of the hires acceptance ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the number of neutrino events observed as deeply penetrating , quasi - horizontal showers is given by @xmath55 where @xmath25 is avogadro s number , @xmath26 is the flux of neutrinos ( per unit energy , per unit time , per solid angle ) , @xmath56 is the neutrino - nucleon scattering cross section , @xmath57 is the acceptance of the detector and @xmath34 is the length of time observed .",
    "this expression assumes that roughly all of the neutrino s energy goes into the produced shower .",
    "if this is not the case , such as with neutral current interactions , a differential cross section should be used as in eq .",
    "( [ muonsrate ] ) and the acceptance be written as a function of the shower energy rather than neutrino energy .    at the very high energies at which air shower experiments are most effective ( 0.1 eev and higher ) , a reasonable and conservative flux of neutrinos to consider",
    "is the cosmogenic flux ( see section  [ flux ] )",
    ". this flux peaks at about 0.1 eev , but is substantial at 1 eev and above .",
    "if we insert this flux , an experimental acceptance and the neutrino - nucleon cross section , we can predict the number of neutrino induced deeply penetrating , quasi - horizontal events which would be observed in an air shower experiment .",
    "in addition to deeply penetrating quasi - horizontal showers , it may be possible to identify showers produced by earth - skimming tau neutrinos using the fluorescence detectors of the auger experiment @xcite .",
    "earth - skimming , ultrahigh - energy tau neutrinos produce tau leptons in charged current interactions . since at ultrahigh - energies the tau decay length is comparable to its interaction length , a shower produced in the tau decay can be observed as an extended air shower if the tau is produced not too deep beneath the earth s surface . the rates for this class of events",
    "is expected to be rather small , however , and we will not study this signature in further detail here .",
    "in high - energy cosmic neutrino experiments , the new physics enters the neutrino - nucleon scattering cross section , @xmath58 , as in eqs .",
    "( [ nint ] ) and ( [ nair ] ) .",
    "it is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the scattering cross section for the neutrino - parton subprocesses , which reflects the fundamental dynamics of neutrino interactions .",
    "the sum is over all contributing partons , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the parton distribution functions .",
    "the cross sections are insensitive to choice of momentum transfer , @xmath63 .",
    "the cross sections are also insensitive to uncertainties in the parton distribution functions at low @xmath21 if there is a tev scale threshold . for instance , the highest - energy neutrino fluxes , which are large at @xmath64 , probe @xmath65 , within the range of validity of the parton distribution functions that we take as cteq5  @xcite .",
    "there are many interesting scenarios in which neutrino - nucleon interactions would be substantially enhanced over the standard model prediction at high energies . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the literature on these models , describing how their signatures may be observed in high - energy cosmic neutrino experiments .      the most dramatic proposal ,",
    "perhaps , is that of tev scale gravity with the existence of extra spatial dimensions .",
    "the motivation for such a scenario can be traced to the understanding of the large hierarchy between the electroweak scale , below about @xmath66(1 tev ) , and the planck scale , @xmath67 gev .",
    "if there are @xmath68 extra spatial dimensions , then the 4-dimensional planck scale is related to the @xmath69-dimensional planck scale , @xmath70 , by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the volume of the extra dimensions if they are flat with a compactification scale , @xmath73 @xcite ; and @xmath74 if the @xmath75 extra dimension is  warped \" with a curvature @xmath76 @xcite .",

    "although the lowest mass possible for the black hole creation is approximately the fundamental planck scale , @xmath87 , the effective center - of - mass energy should be several times larger for the semi - classical argument to hold valid . to parameterize this effect , we introduce the quantity , @xmath110 .",
    "in addition to the ambiguity of the value of @xmath111 , other uncertainties can possibly arise in the estimation of the cross section @xcite , which we do not consider further here . in fig .",
    "[ bhcrossfig ] , we show the cross section for black hole production in neutrino - nucleon interactions for different choices of @xmath70 and @xmath111 . as a result of the sum over all partons and the lack of suppression from small perturbative couplings ,",

    "we see that for the geometric cross section , @xmath112 , and neutrino energies @xmath113 where the cosmogenic flux peaks , black hole production increases the probability of conversion in down - going neutrinos without increasing the cross section so much that vertical neutrinos would be shadowed before reaching the detector . we therefore expect significantly enhanced rates in neutrino telescopes .",
    "the energy - dependence of the black hole production cross section is stronger than for the other processes we have discussed so far , thus confirming the argument that black hole production would likely be the dominant effect of low scale gravity at higher energies .",
    "black holes decay via hawking evaporation almost instantly ( with a lifetime of the order @xmath114 ) .",

    "[ instantonsigma ] @xcite .        from the standpoint of neutrino phenomenology",

    "this is in contrast to the more gradual growth predicted for the cross sections for black hole production , kaluza - klein exchanges , etc . below the energy thresholds for such interactions , the standard model predictions are accurate . at energies",
    "roughly a factor of ten higher , the cross section becomes sufficiently large that the earth efficiently absorbs the incoming neutrino flux , as indicated above the horizontal dotted lines ( horizontal and downward depths ) in fig .",
    "[ instantonsigma ] .",
    "thus in a neutrino telescope , a sharp enhancement in a fairly narrow range of energies is predicted for these models , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ instantonenergy ] . although spectacular , the ability of planned experiments to observe such features is limited , however .",
    "even with the more optimistic of the models considered here , an experiment such as icecube is expected to see only on the order of one event per year from instanton induced processes  @xcite .",
    "future experiments with very large volume will be required to further probe such models .",
    "another interesting characteristic feature of instanton - induced processes is the large multiplicity of final state particles and the violation of @xmath134 .",
    "the basic operators involving quark and lepton fields are of the form @xmath136 @xcite , where @xmath137 is the number of fermion generations .",
    "it has been argued that the processes involving multiple gauge bosons and higgs bosons , such as @xmath138 , can be significantly enhanced @xcite .",
    "a typical neutrino - induced event could thus be @xmath139 with both quarks and leptons of all three generations involved simultaneously in the primary production , this type of events should look quite unique .",
    "it is difficult to predict how such events would appear to the icecube detector , however , given the fact that the particles will be highly collimated and difficult to separate .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) remains a leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "although weak - scale susy is only weakly coupled to the standard model and generally would not lead to substantially enhanced neutrino scattering cross sections , certain charged particles produced by cosmic neutrinos may be long - lived and may provide observable signatures .",
    "this scenario could be naturally realized when the gravitino is the stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , and a charged slepton ( such as stau ) is the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) @xcite .",
    "interactions of high - energy neutrinos may be able to produce pairs of sparticles which rapidly decay to charged slepton nlsps which can only decay further into states including a gravitino .",

    "the top curve corresponds to the standard model charged current interactions .",
    "the figure was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=288 ]    sparticle pair production in neutrino - nucleon interactions is dominated by the @xmath140-channel chargino exchange , resulting in a slepton and a squark .",
    "the squark then quickly decays into a slepton nlsp .",
    "the cross section for this process is rather small , however , typically two to three orders of magnitude below the standard model processes in the energy range well above the kinematic threshold as seen fig .",
    "[ fig : stau ] .",
    "the key observation here is that sleptons produced in neutrino interactions travel through the earth , losing energy via ionization processes and radiation . due to their much greater mass",
    ", sleptons lose far less energy than muons produced in standard model charged current interactions .",
    "the `` slepton range '' can extend to hundreds or thousands of kilometers , thus in part making up for the low cross section for their production .",
    "the two sparticles produced in these interactions travel from their point - of - origin separated by an angle of @xmath141 . therefore , the signature of this process consists of a pair of cerenkov tracks , separated by a distance @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the distance between the detector and the sparticles point - of - origin . considering a pev neutrino , for example , two sleptons separated by @xmath144 could be produced . after travelling @xmath145 kilometers , their tracks",
    "would be separated by @xmath146 meters , which could be potentially distinguished in a neutrino telescope .",
    "this `` double track '' signature would provide a method of distinguishing sparticle tracks from ordinary muon tracks .",
    "typical models with stau - nlps predict only a one- or a few double - track events per year in icecube @xcite .",
    "larger volume detectors , such as extensions of icecube , may be needed to further explore this possibility .    as a final remark on the possibility of observing supersymmetric particles in high - energy cosmic - ray interactions , neutrino experiments may be able to identify particles which are part of the cosmic ray spectrum , such as in cosmic ray models of top - down origin @xcite .",
    "for instance , if a neutralino is the lsp , it will interact with nucleons in a manner which somewhat resembles a neutrino neutral current interaction .",
    "thus without very large fluxes of high - energy cosmic neutralinos , it would be very difficult to distinguish any such particles from neutrinos .",
    "neutralinos can have considerably smaller cross sections with nucleons than neutrinos , however , allowing them to travel through the earth at energies at which neutrinos will be efficiently absorbed @xcite .",
    "thus ultrahigh - energy , neutralino - induced showers provide a low background signal in the direction of the earth .",
    "future space - based air shower experiments , such as owl or euso , may be sensitive to this signature in some scenarios @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have reviewed the ability of neutrino telescopes and air shower experiments to study particle physics with high - energy cosmic neutrinos .",
    "the main advantage of such experiments over traditional collider experiments is the higher energy at which interactions can be studied .",
    "several of the experiments we describe in this article could expect multiple events per year at energies above 1 eev , corresponding to about 40 tev in the center - of - mass frame of a neutrino - nucleon collision .",
    "clearly collider experiments have advantages over astroparticle techniques as well .",
    "most notably , the high luminosities and well - controlled conditions of collider experiments are luxuries astronomers do not often enjoy .    together ,",
    "these advantages and disadvantages determine the areas of particle physics in which neutrino astronomy can be most useful .",
    "in particular , models in which dramatic deviations from the standard model occur at energies beyond the reach of colliders can often be tested in such experiments . in this article , we have reviewed several of such scenarios , summarized as follows :    * kaluza - klein gravitons in low - scale quantum gravity scenarios : sensitive near the threshold , presumably @xmath147 tev or @xmath148 pev .",
