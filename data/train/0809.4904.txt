    "the idea of inflation is a cornerstone of the modern theory of the early universe .",
    "according to inflationary paradigm , universe at early times undergoes a period of rapid ( quasi - exponential ) expansion , which wipes the initial state of the universe clean while seeding the primordial inhomogeneities with quantum fluctuations generated during expansion @xcite .",
    "while universe is inflating , all of its energy sits in the homogeneous scalar field or condensate ( known as inflaton ) , which is in a vacuum - like state with little entropy or particle excitations .",
    "but eventually inflation ends , and this energy has to be deposited into excitations of other matter fields , starting the thermal history of the universe with a hot big bang .",
    "decay of the inflaton can be very efficient if the fields experience dynamical instability at the end of inflation ; such a stage became known as preheating . in most chaotic inflation models , oscillations of the inflaton field can cause instability via parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "although linear development of this instability can be understood analytically @xcite , it might be chaotic @xcite , and one needs to resort to numerical simulations to investigate non - linear dynamics that soon takes over @xcite .",
    "in hybrid inflation models @xcite , in addition to parametric resonance @xcite , one also has a tachyonic instability associated with the symmetry breaking @xcite , dynamics of which has been explored in @xcite .",
    "non - equilibrium dynamics of preheating can lead to a multitude of interesting phenomena .",
    "some of the topics discussed in the literature are formation of topological defects @xcite , production of various particles ( with applications to baryo- and leptogenesis ) @xcite , possibility of primordial black hole formation @xcite , generation of primordial magnetic fields @xcite , and production of stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite . due to difficulties of dealing with non - linear evolution equations , most of these studies rely on numerical simulations .",
    "this paper describes a new code for simulating non - linear scalar field dynamics in expanding universe developed to study preheating , called defrost , and the first results obtained with it .",
    "there are other codes available for this purpose , most notably latticeeasy by gary felder and igor tkachev @xcite , and its parallel version clustereasy @xcite . through the use of more advanced algorithms and careful optimization",
    ", the new code significantly improves both accuracy and performance achievable in simulations of preheating .",
    "an important design goal has been the ease of visualization and analysis of the results , which is all too important for understanding dynamics of complex systems .",
    "we present results on preheating in a simple two - field chaotic inflation model with massive inflaton decaying into another scalar field via quartic coupling @xcite . through our simulations , a new and somewhat simpler picture of the late stages of preheating emerges .",
    "after initial transient when instability develops , bubbles form and then break - up , the matter distribution soon arranges itself in a clumpy state which persists with little changes for a long time . one - point probability distribution function of total energy density in this state appears to be _ universally lognormal _ among various two - field preheating models .",
    "it is tempting to attribute this to relativistic turbulence @xcite .",
    "we also see some evidence that the structure formed during preheating continues to grow in size on a much longer timescale .",
    "somehow , this picture reminds one of large scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ sec : eom ] , we introduce scalar field models of preheating , derive equations of motion , and discuss physical approximations we use .",
    "section  [ sec : solver ] describes the detailed implementation of numerical evolution algorithm .",
    "initial conditions including quantum fluctuations of the fields produced during inflation are discussed in section  [ sec : ic ] , with particular attention paid to implementation of gaussian random field generator .",
    "we briefly recount the theory of preheating via broad parametric resonance at the end of chaotic inflation in section  [ sec : chaotic ] , and present our simulations in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our main results in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "as our baseline model of reheating we will take a system of @xmath0 scalar fields @xmath1 , minimally coupled to gravity and interacting through some ( non - linear ) potential @xmath2 as described by the action @xmath3 the above action can be modified to describe more complicated geometrical quantities ( like a vector field , for example ) instead of a real scalar multiplet @xmath1 .",
    "ultimately what we care about is only field equations of motion and their gravitational effects , not actual gauge symmetries .",
    "variation of the action ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to the metric gives einstein equation with a stress - energy tensor @xmath4 g_{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] while variation with respect to the field @xmath5 gives equation of motion for the field @xmath6 although in principle it is possible to solve the complete system of einstein and scalar field equations numerically ( see @xcite for formulation and some approaches ) , in practice , it is not such an easy thing to do .",
    "einstein equation solvers in @xmath7 dimensions are complex to implement , very expensive to run , and , despite marked improvement in the recent years @xcite , still might have issues with numerical stability .",
    "fortunately for us , we do not have to solve the full einstein equations .",
    "although preheating is a rather violent process , and stress - energy tensor becomes very inhomogeneous due to non - linear field dynamics , the smallness of gravitational coupling constant assures that gravitational backreaction of these inhomogeneities is rather small ( at @xmath8 level in the simulations presented in this paper ) .",
    "thus we are going to treat the scalar field evolution as if it was happening in a homogeneous flat friedman - robertson - walker spacetime @xmath9 and calculate the inhomogeneous gravitational field due to matter distribution with stress - energy tensor ( [ eq : t ] ) using linear perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we will ignore back - reaction of metric perturbations on the scalar field evolution .    with these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "the problem becomes much more tractable : we just need to solve a system of coupled scalar field equations of motion ( [ eq : box ] ) , which in spacetime with metric ( [ eq : frw ] ) become @xmath10 here and later , dot denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath11 , and spatial differential operators ( gradient @xmath12 and laplacian @xmath13 ) are taken with respect to comoving coordinates and three - dimensional flat metric .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath14 and acceleration @xmath15 are determined by averaged einstein equations @xmath16 where energy density @xmath17 and isotropic pressure @xmath18 are components of the stress energy tensor ( [ eq : t ] ) given by @xmath19 and averages are taken over the whole simulation volume .    to solve equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) numerically",
    ", one needs to know the hubble parameter value @xmath20 . rather than attempting to resolve the constraint equation ( [ eq : h ] ) at every time step ( which would result in an implicit evolution scheme ) , it is faster and more convenient to use the evolution equation @xmath21 to evaluate its value in the future .",
    "this is what is done in latticeeasy .",
    "however , we have one more trick up our sleeves : a disproportionately huge gain in numerical accuracy can be realized by evolving the hubble length @xmath22 instead of the hubble parameter @xmath20 by using @xmath23 for constant equation of state @xmath24 , hubble parameter evolves as @xmath25 , while hubble length evolves as @xmath26 .",
    "the latter variable has vanishing second ( and higher ) derivatives and correspondingly smaller truncation error when discretized to second order . as an added bonus , the spatial gradients ( which are the single most expensive thing to calculate )",
    "cancel out when taken in @xmath27 combination , and do not enter evolution equation in the form ( [ eq : l ] ) .",
    "once the field equations of motion ( [ eq : phi ] ) are solved , we can evaluate all the components of stress - energy tensor ( [ eq : t ] ) , in particular energy density ( [ eq : rho ] ) and pressure ( [ eq : p ] ) , as well as calculate linear metric perturbations they create in a homogeneous spacetime ( [ eq : frw ] ) . in this paper , we will focus on scalar perturbations , behaviour of which during preheating have not been widely studied yet . in the longitudinal gauge ,",
    "perturbed metric can be written as @xmath28 the two scalar gravitational potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equal in the absence of anisotropic stress .",
    "this is in general not the case for the scalar field models , and can be expected to hold only approximately and in the average sense .",
    "both gravitational potentials @xmath29 and @xmath30 are non - dynamical , being solutions of the poisson - like equations . in particular , the equation for @xmath30 is @xmath31 strictly speaking , what should stand in the right hand side is not the density @xmath17 , but the gauge - invariant density variable @xmath32 , which has some extra terms in it @xcite . at this stage of the code development",
    ", i will not make that distinction and simply ignore the missing terms ( which usually works well on sub - horizon scales ) , along with anisotropic stress contribution to potential @xmath29",
    ". full support of gauge - invariant perturbations including tensor and vector modes is planned for the future code release .",
    "scalar field equations of motion ( [ eq : phi ] ) are coupled non - linear partial differential equations , and have to be solved numerically .",
    "fortunately , all the non - linearity comes from the potential term only ; the differential operator itself is simple , homogeneous and hyperbolic , which makes the numerical solution quite straightforward . for the solver",
    ", we adopt a second - order accurate finite difference scheme based on leapfrog algorithm .",
    "the scalar field values @xmath5 are discretized on three - dimensional cubic @xmath33 grid in comoving coordinates with uniform spacing @xmath34 and periodic boundary conditions . since evolution equations ( [ eq : phi ] ) are second order , values of the fields on two consecutive time slices are required to advance to the next one .",

    "the apparent lognormality of a density distribution is undoubtedly not a mere coincidence , but must have a explanation rooted in scalar field dynamics .",
    "moreover , further simulations of preheating models with different couplings and inflaton potentials seem to suggest that lognormal distribution of density is a _ universal feature _ of two - field preheating models .",
    "this observation presents a very interesting theoretical puzzle , which will be explored in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "although one - point distribution of total energy density @xmath17 quickly becomes stationary as noted above , other quantities continue evolving on much longer time scales .",
    "the blobs continue to fragment , and their characteristic size slowly decreases with time . while this is obvious from visualizations , it can be further quantified by introducing the ( physical ) correlation length of the total energy density configuration @xmath47 the evolution of the comoving correlation length @xmath48 is plotted in the left panel of figure  [ fig : scale ] .",
    "initially it is very large ( @xmath49 ) , as the density field is nearly homogeneous .",
    "as instability develops and structure forms , it abruptly drops to about @xmath50 , and then continues to decrease , but much more slowly .",
    "although the graph clearly shows evolutionary trend in density correlation length @xmath48 , actual numbers should be taken with a grain of salt , as the density field does eventually become fragmented on a scale close to spatial grid resolution ( which for @xmath51 grid we use would be reached around @xmath52 ) .    while it is known that thermalization after preheating might take a long time @xcite , and there might be an intermediate scaling regime in the evolution of the fields @xcite , the view of the process from the real space presented here is strikingly simple .",
    "one would think the field distributions will thermalize eventually , presumably forming a homogeneous fluid - like state with maxwellian distribution of particle velocities .",
    "thermalization _ does not happen _ in our simulations , which lack necessary quantum effects .",
    "exactly _ how _ and _ when _ it does happen is an extremely interesting question , and the one which requires further study .",
    "finally , let us discuss gravitational potential @xmath30 , which is sourced by the evolving energy density distribution @xmath17 , and is shown in the middle row of figure  [ fig : rho ] . to make the structure more visible , we have opted for a density plot on a three - slice through the simulation box rather than a volume rendering .",
    "the color map shows positive potential values ( corresponding to under - dense regions ) as shades of red , and negative potential values ( corresponding to over - dense regions ) as shades of blue , blending into white for zero potential value .",
    "immediately after the onset of instability , the gravitational potential in figure  [ fig : rho ] ( middle left ) clearly traces the foam - like structure of matter distribution .",
    "the isolated potential peaks ( red ) in the interior of the bubbles are separated by extended potential valleys ( blue ) created by over - dense bubble walls .",
    "the gravitational potential configuration is asymmetric between positive and negative values , and is clearly non - gaussian .",
    "subsequent evolution of the gravitational potential is rather interesting .",
    "as bubble walls break into smaller and smaller blobs , the structure of the gravitational potential does not follow suit . instead , it begins to grow in spatial extent",
    "( the animation is available http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/defrost/m2g22/volume-psi.avi[online ] ) . by the end of the simulation in figure  [ fig : rho ] ( middle",
    "right ) , the size of the structure in the gravitational potential spans almost the whole box .",
    "the growth of structure can be quantified by introducing correlation length @xmath53 for gravitational potential the way we did for energy density @xmath54 evolution of the comoving correlation length @xmath55 is plotted in the right panel of figure  [ fig : scale ] , with pale line tracing its instantaneous value , and thick red line giving a running average ( with kaiser window ) over few oscillations .",
    "while comoving correlation length grows overall , evolution shown in figure  [ fig : scale ] ( right ) still represents an initial transient , and the long - time asymptotic behaviour is not reached in the simulation reported here .",
    "further investigation shows that correlation length @xmath53 continues to grow faster than comoving size , but not quite as fast as the horizon size .",
    "eventually one might even have to worry about it outgrowing the finite simulation box size , but that would take a very long time , and is not reached by our simulations .",
    "this paper presents a new numerical code i developed for simulating preheating of the universe after the end of the inflation , which i call defrost .",
    "it is small ( about 600 lines of fortran code ) , fast , easy to modify , and is fully instrumented for 3d visualizations ( using http://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/[llnls visit ] , for example ) .",
    "the source code is available for download online at http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/defrost/ and is distributed under the terms of gnu public license . while the main design goal of defrost has been the accuracy of the simulations , performance of the solver has also been significantly improved compared to latticeeasy  @xcite , which is the most mature and widely used reheating code publicly available today .    as a result of all the optimizations ( and a bit of black magic ) , defrost outperforms latticeeasy by about a factor of four in raw pde solver speed ( for 2 fields on a @xmath51 grid in double precision on a dual xeon 5160 machine ) while using more accurate ( and more expensive ) discretization . if one takes into account the time spent on analysis of the results , the difference is even larger , as fftw libraries used by defrost are vastly faster than fft routines shipped with latticeeasy ( especially on multi - processor machines ) .",
    "the speed - up offered by defrost is so significant that the studies done a few years ago on a big parallel cluster @xcite using mpi version of latticeeasy @xcite can now be carried out on a single fast workstation .",
    "the planned mpi version of defrost should be able to push the accessible simulation size over the @xmath56 barrier , provided the code scales well .",
    "the code was tested on a number of chaotic inflation models which end via parametric resonance . in this paper , we report the simulations of the simplest two - field preheating model with massive inflaton and quartic coupling to decay field ( [ eq : model ] ) . we reproduce the previously published numerical results for this model @xcite ( and the ones for trilinear coupling @xcite , which we will not discuss here , although our simulation data and results for that model are available http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/defrost/m2s12l4[online ] as well ) .",
    "we further investigate the dynamics of the scalar field evolution in these preheating models , taking advantage of advanced visualization and analysis capabilities defrost offers .",
    "in particular , we study the behaviour of energy density distribution and scalar gravitational potential during preheating , something which has not been looked at closely before .",
    "our main science results are summarized by two observations , both novel and quite surprising .",
    "first , the evolving scalar fields quickly end up in a simple state , which , although highly inhomogeneous , appears to have a certain universality to it . in this state ,",
    "the one - point distribution function of total energy density is nearly stationary ( apart for the overall dilution due to expansion ) , and is described by a lognormal distribution for _ all two - field parametric resonance preheating models we tried so far _ , namely the ones described by interaction potentials    * @xmath57 , * @xmath58 , * @xmath59 , * @xmath60 .",
    "this is true even if distributions of field values or other correlators might still be evolving , and appears to be a very general statement about random scalar fields one encounters in preheating .",
    "it is tempting to attribute this state to scalar field turbulence @xcite , especially since lognormal density distributions are known to occur in supersonic isothermal turbulence in hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "we do not see obvious signs of thermalization , even if the simulations are run for a time much longer than the dynamical timescale of the problem ( the longest done so far for massive inflaton is @xmath61 corresponding to five @xmath62-folds since the end of inflation ; this is limited mainly by my patience rather than the code stability ) .",
    "second , less general but still amusing , is the observation that the small - scale structure in the gravitational potential can grow faster than comoving box expands .",
    "it is not quite clear whether the reason for it happening is kinematic or dynamical in nature .",
    "as we neglected gravitational interactions in our simulations , the only thing that can cause the structure to grow is the interaction between scalar fields themselves . in our preheating model",
    "it is repulsive ; yet the structure still grows !",
    "although one might suspect that any inhomogeneity in gravitational potential on sub - horizon scales would probably get washed away by subsequent evolution ( and is too small to form primordial black holes ) , this effect still might have some interesting cosmological consequences .",
    "all in all , we find that the picture of preheating dynamics is simpler in real space than what it looks like in particle representation .",
    "the final stage of preheating , with growing structure and lognormal density distribution , eerily reminds one of large scale structure formation in later cosmology ( although of course it occurs on vastly smaller scales and is driven by completely different physics ) .",
    "perhaps the analytical methods developed for the latter @xcite could be fruitfully applied to preheating as well .",
    "this is what we intend to explore next .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada under discovery grants program .",
    "numerical computations were done in part on sunnyvale cluster at canadian institute for theoretical astrophysics .",
    "the author is grateful for hospitality during his stays at cita , where some portion of this work has been carried out , and would like to thank lev kofman , andrei linde , gary felder , and mustafa amin for helpful discussions of preheating , and chris matzner for bringing the subject of isothermal supersonic turbulence to my attention .",

    "<S> at the end of inflation , dynamical instability can rapidly deposit the energy of homogeneous cold inflaton into excitations of other fields . </S>",

    "<S> this paper presents a new code for simulating scalar field dynamics in expanding universe written for that purpose . </S>",
    "<S> compared to available alternatives , it significantly improves both the speed and the accuracy of calculations , and is fully instrumented for 3d visualization . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce previously published results on preheating in simple chaotic inflation models , and further investigate non - linear dynamics of the inflaton decay . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that the fields do not want to thermalize quite the way one would think . instead of directly reaching equilibrium , the evolution appears to be stuck in a rather simple but quite inhomogeneous state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , one - point distribution function of total energy density appears to be _ universal _ among various two - field preheating models , and is exceedingly well described by a lognormal distribution . </S>",
