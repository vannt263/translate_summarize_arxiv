    "the origin of water on earth is still puzzling ( e.g. the reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . at one end of the models ,",
    "the high temperature in the inner accretion disk hampered hydrous phases to exist so that external sources were needed , the so - called late veneer of comets , asteroids and/or meteorites suggested by lunar cratering ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the other end , earth accreted hydrous silicate phases , or grains having adsorbed water from the solar nebula .",
    "the d / h isotopic ratio plays a key role in constraining the models .",
    "the comparable d / h ratio of earth s oceans and carbonaceous chondrites ( the only ones to contain enough water ) points towards a meteoritic veneer , while the cometary d / h ratio , twice as high as the terrestrial one , would require a mixture of cometary water with a roughly equal amount of primitive indigeneous d - poor terrestrial water .",
    "while the abundance of noble gases in the earth s atmosphere suggests that only small amounts of cometary volatiles were brought to earth , the @xmath2os/@xmath3os ratio apparently rules out the carbonaceous chondrites as the main component of the veneer ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , most of these arguments have shortcomings ( see discussions by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in particular , d /",
    "h has only been measured in oort - cloud comets and it is not excluded that other types of comets or other reservoirs of hydrogen in comets exhibit different d / h ratios .",
    "additional constraints are therefore mandatory .",
    "recently , we found that the isotopic ratio @xmath0n/@xmath1n  is consistently twice as high in cometary cn and hcn as in the earth s atmosphere and surface @xcite . since any delivery of water by comets would necessarily be accompanied by a delivery of nitrogen , the observed difference between terrestrial and cometary @xmath0n/@xmath1n  can induce a measurable isotopic shift and provide independent constraints on the amount of water and nitrogen delivered by comets to earth s oceans and atmosphere , as detailed below .",
    "the interest of considering the nitrogen isotopic ratio has been recently emphasized by @xcite .",
    "we assume that cometary h@xmath4o and hdo add to a primitive mixture on earth to give the amounts presently measured in earth s water .",
    "we have then @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the abundance in number , the suffix @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 respectively referring to primitive earth , cometary and terrestrial ( present earth ) values . from these equations we derive @xmath10 which provides the proportion of earth s water due to comets as a function of the isotopic ratio d / h in water .",
    "the present earth d / h ratio is fairly well known and measured to be ( d / h)@xmath11 = 1.49@xmath120.03 10@xmath13 for water stored at the earth s surface , mainly in the oceans @xcite . for cometary water we have ( d / h)@xmath14 = 3.1@xmath120.3 10@xmath13 from in situ measurements of comet 1p / halley @xcite and from remote observations of three oort - cloud comets : c/1996 b2 ( hyakutake ) @xcite , c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) @xcite and c/2002 t7 ( linear ) @xcite .",
    "the primitive earth d / h ratio is not known . at one extreme",
    ", we have the protosolar value of the huge h@xmath4 reservoir measured from dh / h@xmath4 in jupiter : ( d / h)@xmath15 0.26 10@xmath13 @xcite . at the other end ,",
    "the d / h ratio estimated to be representative of the deep mantle ( d / h)@xmath16 1.36 10@xmath13 @xcite . in the case",
    "that water from the warm , inner solar nebula is adsorbed by the rocky grains that formed the bulk of the earth , intermediate values ( d / h)@xmath17 0.81.0 10@xmath13 are likely to better characterize the primitive earth d / h ratio @xcite . with these values",
    ", the proportion of earth s water due to comets varies between 50% and 10% ( eq .  2 ) , with plausible values up to 30% @xcite .",
    "more detailed modelling , combining the d / h ratios with lunar cratering records and terrestrial mantle siderophiles , suggests that the contribution of comets to earth s water is smaller than 10% @xcite .",
    "moreover , should a significant fraction of cometary material possess an even higher d / h as measured in hcn @xcite and assuming that this material can be recycled at the earth s surface , even smaller cometary contributions would be expected .",
    "assuming similarly that the nitrogen isotopic ratio of the present earth results from the combination of primitive earth and cometary nitrogen mixtures , we have @xmath18 and @xmath19    since nitrogen is mostly in the form @xmath1n , we may write @xmath20 with the constraint @xmath21 which comes from the fact that the total amount of nitrogen delivered by comets to earth can not exceed the amount of nitrogen presently measured in earth s atmosphere and surface , i.e. @xmath22 . nitrogen recycling at earth s surface is implicitly assumed as well as the fact that the composition of the atmosphere has not significantly changed since the late veneer @xcite .",
    "the amount of water and nitrogen at the surface of the present earth ( mostly in the oceans and in the atmosphere , respectively ) is relatively well known .",
    "the water inventory by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives 1.7 10@xmath23 kg of water at the earth s surface ( oceans , ice sheets , organic matter , metamorphic rocks , shales , sandstones , continental carbonates , evaporites , marine clays and marine carbonates ) .",
    "the nitrogen inventory at the earth s surface ( atmosphere , sedimentary rocks , crustal igneous rocks ) gives 5.0 10@xmath24 kg of n@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath25 @xmath26 3.8  10@xmath27 .    the abundance of nitrogen in comets is poorly known . because n@xmath4 is not detected",
    ", the nitrogen inventory in cometary ices mainly relies on the measurement of the nh@xmath28 and hcn volatiles . from the abundances given by @xcite , we compute",
    "@xmath29 10@xmath30 adding the contributions of all observed n - bearing molecules and considering that contributions from other molecules are possible .",
    "based on in - situ measurements by the giotto spacecraft , @xcite estimated the total n / o abundance in 1p / halley : n / o = 0.027@xmath120.009 , including both the gas and the dust components . assuming that at most 60% of o is in h@xmath4o @xcite , @xmath31 3 10@xmath30 .",
    "further modelling by @xcite and @xcite suggests that @xmath32 may be as high as 7  10@xmath30 , nitrogen being still depleted in comets by a factor 3 with respect to solar abundances . under the hypothesis that the nitrogen abundance in 1p / halley is representative of comets , we adopt the lower limit @xmath31 3 10@xmath30 from which we derive @xmath33 @xmath34 13% ( eq .",
    "the present earth @xmath0n/@xmath1n  ratio is accurately measured from n@xmath4 in the atmosphere : ( @xmath0n/@xmath1n)@xmath11 = 3.676 @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to @xmath0n/@xmath1n  = 3.64 10@xmath27 which characterizes the present mantle @xcite .",
    "the primitive earth @xmath0n/@xmath1n  is not known .",
    "it may be close to @xmath0n/@xmath1n  @xmath26 3.55 10@xmath27 , the value measured in enstatite chondrites thought to have released significant amounts of nitrogen during and shortly after the accretion phase @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a massive atmosphere could have been captured directly from the solar nebula @xcite where @xmath0n/@xmath1n  @xmath26 2.3 10@xmath27 ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* this value is estimated from the atmosphere of jupiter assumed to be a proxy of the n@xmath4 reservoir in the solar system . ) .",
    "a large part of the early atmosphere might have been lost during the post - accretion phase ( much before the late veneer ) , possibly resulting in a small shift of the primitive @xmath0n/@xmath1nratio due to atmospheric escape @xcite .",
    "given these uncertainties we consider in the following both ( @xmath0n/@xmath1n)@xmath36 = 2.3 10@xmath27 and ( @xmath0n/@xmath1n)@xmath36 = 3.55 10@xmath27 .",
    "intermediate values are possible , as well as values closer to the present terrestrial value if fractionation by atmospheric escape has been significant .",
    "@xmath0n/@xmath1n  has been measured remotely in about twenty comets using optical - uv spectroscopy of cn , and in three comets on the basis of radio observations of hcn .",
    "recent studies show that optical and radio measurements do agree within uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen isotopic ratio is remarkably similar from comet to comet and clusters around the `` anomalous '' @xmath0n/@xmath1n  = 6.8@xmath120.3 10@xmath27 which is twice as high as the terrestrial value @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of comet 81p / wild2 grains returned by stardust suggests bulk @xmath0n/@xmath1n  ratios comparable to the terrestrial and chondritic values @xcite .",
    "we therefore compute an average cometary ratio according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 = 6.8 10@xmath27 , @xmath39 = 3.55 10@xmath27 , and @xmath40 is the abundance of the isotopically anomalous nitrogen .    in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the proportion of terrestrial nitrogen delivered by comets , @xmath41 , as a function of the relative abundance of anomalous nitrogen @xmath42 for various cases of interest ( eqs . 4 and 7 ) .",
    "1 shows that the nitrogen isotopic shift between primitive and present earth can be easily accounted for by the addition of a cometary component thanks to the presence , even in small quantities , of isotopically anomalous nitrogen in comets .",
    "the proportion of terrestrial water delivered by comets can be computed from fig .  1 and eq .  5 , i.e. @xmath33 @xmath34",
    "0.13@xmath43@xmath41 for @xmath44 3 10@xmath30 .    assuming that the carrier of the isotopically anomalous nitrogen is only hcn , we have @xmath45 2 10@xmath27 using the abundances of @xcite . although @xmath46 has not yet been measured in cometary ammonia , fractionation mechanisms predict that @xmath0n must be enhanced in nh@xmath28 before being transferred to hcn compounds @xcite .",
    "if nh@xmath28 is also included in the carriers of the anomalous @xmath0n/@xmath1nratio , we have @xmath47 8 10@xmath27 using 6 10@xmath27 for the mean abundance of nh@xmath28 relative to h@xmath4o @xcite . in this case between 15% and 65% of earth s nitrogen",
    "might have been delivered by comets ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we then estimate the upper limit @xmath48 @xmath34 9% , which can be as low as @xmath49 @xmath34 2% if the primitive earth @xmath0n/@xmath1n  was close to 3.55 10@xmath27 .",
    "given that the abundance of nitrogen in comets is probably larger than @xmath32 = 3 10@xmath30 , and that the refractory component may also contain isotopically anomalous nitrogen , the contribution of comets to earth s water is probably roughly twice as small as the upper limit we just derived , i.e. not larger than a few percent .",
    "these constraints are more stringent than the values derived from d / h using eq .  2 .",
    "moreover , as soon as @xmath49 @xmath34 7% , the amount of water delivered by comets is not sufficient to explain the d / h isotopic shift in terrestrial oceans from the primitive value ( eq .",
    "2 ) so that additional sources of water are needed .",
    "our estimates agree with the constraints derived from recent dynamical models of the solar system @xcite , and from mass - balance models based on d / h @xcite or based on noble metals and gases @xcite .",
    "as far as the atmosphere is concerned , @xcite showed that a cometary contribution fitting the abundances of noble gases in the earth s atmosphere would deliver @xmath50 6% of the atmospheric nitrogen .",
    "given the uncertainties on the abundances of noble gases in comets @xcite , this is compatible with our estimates provided that @xmath45 10@xmath30 and ( @xmath0n/@xmath1n)@xmath36 @xmath26 3.55 10@xmath27 in fig .  1 .",
    "early fractionation due to atmospheric escape @xcite might also have slightly increased ( @xmath0n/@xmath1n)@xmath36 providing an even better agreement .",
    "it is important to note that the anomalous @xmath0n/@xmath1n  isotopic ratio was measured to be identical in oort - cloud and kuiper - belt comets @xcite so that our estimates apply to the contributions of both types of comets .",
    "thanks to the fact that the @xmath0n/@xmath1n  ratio measured in cometary cn and hcn is significantly different from the ratio measured on earth , and since any delivery of nitrogen from comets to earth necessarily accompanied that of water , we put independent constraints on the amount of earth s water possibly due to comets . under reasonable assumptions , we find that no more than a few percent of earth s water can be attributed to comets .",
    "this is consistent with the constraints derived from d / h using various models @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0n/@xmath1n  isotope ratio is not different in oort - cloud and kuiper - belt comets , our estimates apply to both types of objects .",
    "our results also suggest that a significant part of earth s nitrogen might come from comets , supporting the idea of a dual origin of the earth s atmosphere @xcite",
    ". a critical measurement to further constrain these quantities would be the determination of the @xmath0n/@xmath1n  ratio in cometary nh@xmath28 , expected to be either anomalous or terrestrial .",
    "although more detailed modelling is required for more quantitative estimates , our results demonstrate the interest of considering the @xmath0n/@xmath1n  ratio to evaluate the contribution of comets to the late bombardment of the earth .",
