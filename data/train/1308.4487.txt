    "recently , significant progress has been made toward synthesizing gnrs of specific edge orientations.@xcite based on our results , we predict that the thermal conductance anisotropy between agnrs and zgnrs suggests selective use of zgnrs as fillers in thermal interface materials because their thermal conductance is higher and less adversely affected by strain as compared to agnrs .",
    "agnrs on the other hand , might act as a suitable thermoelectric material because of their inherent lower thermal conductance compared to zgnrs , and their thermal conductance can be further lowered with the application of strain .",
    "however , the nonmonotonic variation of thermal conductance with respect to strain for the agnrs means that straining the agnrs to decrease their thermal conductance shall only be effective above the cross - over temperature .     versus strain @xmath34 for * ( a ) * agnr-@xmath1 ( @xmath61 , @xmath83 , and @xmath81 ) and * ( b ) * zgnr-@xmath1 ( @xmath82 , @xmath94 , and @xmath83 ) at @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129  k. [ fig : relative - conductance - agnr - and - zgnr - different - strain - diff - t ] , width=272 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the thermal conductance of agnr-@xmath1 and zgnr-@xmath1 as a function of tensile strain on the gnrs with accurate density - functional theory calculations and the nonequilibrium green s function method .",
    "the lateral lattice constants of agnr-@xmath1 are found to follow a three - family behavior that depends on @xmath1 .",
    "we found that tensile strain decreases the force constants in the in - plane directions of the gnrs , but slightly increases the force constants in the out - of - plane direction , which increase the two lowest - frequency out - of - plane acoustic modes .",
    "these modes play a decisive role in increasing the thermal conductance of agnr-@xmath1 at low temperatures , but not for zgnr-@xmath1 .",
    "hence the fact that the phonon dispersions of zgnr-@xmath1 is more dispersive than that of agnr-@xmath1 of comparable widths results in two important outcomes : ( 1 ) the unstrained zgnr-@xmath1 has a higher thermal conductance compared to the unstrained agnr-@xmath1 of comparable widths , and ( 2 ) that at low temperatures , the thermal conductance of the strained zgnr-@xmath1 is less sensitive toward the effect of strain than that of agnr-@xmath1 . at high temperatures , the thermal conductance of the strained zgnr-@xmath1 and agnr-@xmath1 decreases ( relative to the unstrained ones ) with strain due to the fact that the frequency of the high - frequency modes shifts down as a result of the weakening of the interatomic force constants in the in - plane direction .",
    "the use of the state - of - the - art techniques such as density - functional theory and the nonequilibrium green s function method is able to reveal intricate quantum - mechanical effects that may be hard or impossible to be captured with force - field type interactions .",
    "finally , it might be interesting to study the role of out - of - plane modes in other strained single - layer systems such bn , mos@xmath141 , and wse@xmath141 .",
