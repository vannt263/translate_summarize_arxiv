    "at top cern sps and at rhic energies the initial energy density reached in heavy ion collisions is apparently large enough to create a deconfined phase at the early stage of the collision : the quark gluon plasma @xcite@xcite . on the other hand , at lower energies , at the ags , the maximum energy density is probably not sufficient to produce such a state of matter .",
    "therefore , an energy scan progam in the intermediate energy range , covered by the cern sps , was initiated .",
    "the goal was to find anomalies in the energy dependence which could be related to the change of the number of degrees of freedom connected to a phase transition of the hot and dense matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in the course of the sps energy scan program , the na49 collaboration measured the hadronic final state of central pb+pb collisions at 20 , 30 , 40 , 80 , and 158 agev beam energy .",
    "a detailed description of the na49 setup is given in @xcite . in the following",
    ", the energy dependence of selected hadronic observables will be discussed , with the main focus on where we start to see indications of a deconfined phase of matter .",
    "a model independent way to compare transverse momentum spectra is to consider the mean transverse mass @xmath0 . in figure 1 the energy dependence of this quantity",
    "is shown for pions , kaons and protons .    if energy density and hence pressure increase with beam energy , a stronger transverse expansion is expected at higher energies .",
    "assuming that the strength of the transverse expansion is reflected in the mean transverse mass , the observable @xmath0 will rise with @xmath1 .        at ags energies",
    "we indeed observe a strong increase of the mean transverse mass of pions , kaons and protons with energy .",
    "however , at lower sps energies this behaviour changes : the mean transverse mass increases only weakly with beam energy .",
    "this charateristic change in the energy dependence has been interpreted as a signature for a phase transition @xcite . because the equation of state - the relation between energy density and pressure - changes at the phase boundary and with it the strength of the transverse expansion .",
    "this observation supports the hypothesis , that the initial energy density reached in central a+a collisions at lower sps energies is already large enough , to force a phase transition of the strongly interacting nuclear matter .",
    "the total pion multiplicity per wounded nucleon as a function of fermi s measure @xmath2 is shown in figure 2 left .",
    "the relative pion production in central pb+pb collisions increases with collision energy , but starting from lower sps energies the rate of increase grows .",
    "this feature is not visible in p+p interactions .",
    "the steepening of the energy dependence can be explained by an increase of the effective number of degrees of freedom due to the onset of deconfinement at about 30 agev beam energy @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the energy dependence of relative strangeness production .",
    "the ratios of the total multiplicities @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in central pb+pb collisions are compared to model calculations and when available to p+p interactions .",
    "while @xmath4 and @xmath6 ratios rise continuously with energy , a distinct maximum is visible in the energy dependence of the ratios @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "hadron gas @xcite ( hgm ) and microscopic models @xcite ( rqmd , urqmd ) roughly describe the trend of the energy dependence , but especially the pronounced peak in the @xmath3 ratio is not reproduced .",
    "as demonstrated in figure 3 , this feature is also absent in p+p interactions .    , @xmath6 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 in central a+a collisions and p+p interactions .",
    "lines indicate model calculations.,height=151 ]    the total strangeness production to pion rate can be approximated by @xmath7 .",
    "as seen from figure 2 ( right ) , we find that the hadron gas and microscopic models describe the trend of the data , but they do not show the distinct maximum at lower sps energies . only a model @xcite ( smes ) including a phase transition around 30 agev exhibits a peak as seen in the data .",
    "the energy dependence of several observables shows anomalies at lower sps energies .",
    "these signatures indicate , that the energy density reached in a+a collisions at beam energies of about 30 agev are already sufficient to produce a deconfined phase .    the next question to address is , how the system behaves when the volume is varied . at which intermediate system size appear indications for a deconfined phase ?",
    "future experiments at the sps could deliver the answer to this question if the proposed light ion program will be approved @xcite .",
