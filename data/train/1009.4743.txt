    "magnetization switching triggered by femtosecond laser pulses has been studied in recent years .",
    "ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic metals and semiconductors has also been reported.@xcite these phenomena show thermal magnetic switching with light pulses on picosecond time scales.@xcite however , heat - assisted spin reorientation is relatively slow because of the thermal diffusion time .",
    "a light pulse with a certain polarization nonthermally modifies the electron spin state.@xcite recently , it has been reported that spin precession is induced by a circularly polarized pulse in antiferromagnetic ( afm ) dyfeo@xmath0 with weak ferromagnetic ( fm ) moment.@xcite the phase of spin precession changes by 180@xmath1 on reversal of the pump helicity .",
    "the interpretation of this phenomenon is that an effective magnetic field pulse parallel to the pump wave vector is induced by the circularly polarized light pulse , giving rise to the precession .",
    "the magnetic field generation effect is referred to as the inverse faraday effect ( ife ) .",
    "the same effect has also been observed even in pure afm nio with no net magnetic moment in the ground state.@xcite the resonance frequencies of afm materials reach the terahertz range , which is several orders of magnitude higher than that of fm materials .",
    "for that reason , afm materials attract much attention in the context of ultrafast spin control.@xcite spin precession is also observed with a linearly polarized pump pulse , in particular , a pulse polarized in a direction non - parallel to the crystal axes .",
    "this phenomenon is called the inverse cotton  mouton effect ( icme).@xcite a detailed review of these phenomena can be found in ref .  .",
    "the ultrafast ife and icme are interpreted as impulsive stimulated raman scattering ( isrs).@xcite an electron in the ground state is excited by the pump pulse into a virtual state , which changes the orbital momentum of the electron .",
    "the nonzero orbital momentum flips the electron spin with spin - orbit coupling in the virtual state .",
    "the excited electron radiates a photon and transits to the final state .",
    "the energy gap between the final and ground states corresponds to the spin precession energy .",
    "isrs is a modulation of the dielectric permittivity by the pump pulse and should be dependent on the properties of the pulse , such as its polarization , wavelength , and fluence .",
    "therefore , examining the dependence of the photoinduced spin precession on these properties will help us to understand the isrs mechanism . in particular , it is not obvious how the pump photon energy influences spin precession .",
    "an action spectrum of photoinduced spin precession should indicate the relation between the optical excited state and the spin precession via isrs .    in the majority of previous publications ,",
    "the excitation of spin oscillations by ultrashort laser pulses was associated with ife and icme separately . in the present work ,",
    "we report spin precession induced via isrs as functions of the pump pulse polarization and wavelength .",
    "we found that both effects , ife and icme are working in the same way , exciting the same mode of spin precession .",
    "the phases of the spin precession via ife and icme differ by 90@xmath1 , allowing the two effects to be distinguished .",
    "we found an essential dependence of the phase on the pump wavelength and demonstrated that the ife and icme are dominating effects in different spectral regions , in the visible region and in the near - infrared region , respectively .",

    "the _ time derivative _ of the effective magnetic field plays a role of the driving force , leading to an initial deviation of the vector @xmath192 from its equilibrium direction .",
    "@xcite for this _ field - derivative mechanism _",
    ", the amplitudes of spin deviations are expected to be smaller than for inertial mechanism , but can be realized for any antiferromagnet , even a purely compensated one .",
    "the latter mechanism has beed observed experimentally in afm nickel oxide , where the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction is forbidden by symmetry .",
    "@xcite it is interesting to understand which mechanism is responsible for the spin oscillations observed in the present work .",
    "the lagrangian density of the sigma model can be written as follows:@xcite @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the effective magnetic field and @xmath196 is the effective anisotropy energy that includes @xmath197-dependent terms from the hamiltonian and a contribution from the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : weff ] ) below .",
    "the slave variable , magnetic moment @xmath65 , can be easily expressed via vector @xmath66 and its time derivative , @xmath198 where @xmath199 . within the sigma - model approximation ,",
    "the length of the vector @xmath66 should be treated as a constant , @xmath200 .",
    "thus , in the linear approximation @xmath201 and the two components , @xmath57 and @xmath54 can be considered as independent variables .",
    "it is in line with our experimental observation that the component @xmath56 is completely negligible .",
    "the effective anisotropy energy can be taken in the form @xmath202 where the additive constant is omitted .",
    "free oscillations of the two components at @xmath203 correspond to two independent magnon modes ( f- and af - modes ) , described by the following equations @xmath204    now let us discuss the excitations of the modes by light pulses .",
    "the interaction of the spin system with the light is described by the hamiltonian , that for the specific case of circularly or linearly polarized light reads as or , respectively . within the sigma - model approach , for different polarizations",
    "the interaction terms enter different parts of the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag ] ) : the circularly polarized light contributes to the effective field @xmath205 , whereas the effect of the linearly polarized light is described by the time - dependent contribution @xmath206 to the effective anisotropy energy @xmath207 . among all these contributions to the lagrangian",
    ", we need to find terms linear on @xmath57 and @xmath54 , which produce the `` driving force '' , i.e. , lead to a non - zero right - hand side in the equations of motion  .",
    "the light - induced effective field is directed along @xmath22-axis , and it is easy to see that the term @xmath208 gives no `` driving force '' contributions for both modes .",
    "the gyroscopic term with @xmath209 provides such a term for @xmath43-component of the vector @xmath210 , proportional to @xmath211 , but not for its @xmath22-component .",
    "thus , for the state of interest ( @xmath212 in the ground state ) , the ife can excite the af - mode only . in the discussion presented above",
    ", the only part proportional to @xmath213 gives an essential contribution to @xmath214 .",
    "using these relations , one can find that all the terms do not affect the equation for @xmath54 ( f - mode ) , whereas the equation for @xmath57 describing the af - mode acquires nonzero right - hand side and reads as @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the effective field .",
    "then , after the delta function substitution @xmath217 , we arrive at the following initial conditions for this equation @xmath218 where @xmath219 and @xmath220 determine independent action of circularly and linearly polarized light , respectively , with @xmath221 and @xmath220 being the corresponding integrated pulse intensities .",
    "as one can see from the equation , within the sigma - model approach the effective magnetic field created by the ife enters the equation through its time derivative only , whereas the inertial mechanism is caused solely by icme . thus the _ field - derivative mechanism _ of the action of ife ,",
    "discussed previously for compensated antiferromagnets ,  @xcite is responsible for the excitation of spin oscillations in the @xmath222-phase of dysprosium orthoferrite investigated here .",
    "we conclude that it is difficult to realize the inertial mechanism of the field pulse action in the majority of orthoferrites at high temperatures where the same @xmath222-phase is present .",
    "the inertial mechanism has been observed for a special phase of holmium orthoferrite where the vector @xmath66 is not collinear with the symmetry axis .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , for the present experiment the icme leads to inertial mechanism of the spin excitations .",
    "after the action of the pulse , only free spin oscillations persist in the system .",
    "they are described by the solution @xmath223 where the amplitude @xmath224 and the phase @xmath225 are determined by the initial conditions   as follows : @xmath226    finally , we arrive at the previous result : if one of the two mechanisms , ife or icme , is dominating , the the phase of the @xmath58 oscillations takes the values @xmath227 , @xmath228 or @xmath229 , respectively .",
    "thus , the observed time dependence of the faraday rotation oscillations is proportional to @xmath230 or @xmath231 for the dominating role of ife or icme , respectively .",
    "if none of the mechanisms is truly dominating , then the observed phase should take an intermediate value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : a_xi ] ) .",
    "it is worth to note that the condition for domination of a certain effect does not translate into a plain comparison of the effective constant values @xmath135 and @xmath232 for ife and icme , respectively .",
    "the point is , the icme contributes through the inertial mechanism that is much more effective than the field - derivative mechanism involved in the action of ife . in our calculation",
    ", this leads to appearance of the large multiplier @xmath233 , where @xmath234  thz , @xmath235 600  t is the exchange field of orthoferrite ,  @xcite in the contribution of icme , see eq .  .",
    "therefore the domination of ife , for the same value of the pulse fluence , needs at least 50 times higher value of the corresponding constant , and the ratio @xmath236 is expected to be large enough for orthoferrites .",
    "thus , the above analysis gives us a possibility to estimate the values of constants responsible for different inverse magneto - optical effects , ife and icme .      in the previous discussion , based on the landau - lifshitz equations and the nonlinear sigma model",
    ", we came to the conclusion that the time dependence of @xmath58 induced via ife and icme is proportional to @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "the phase of the oscillation is constant and @xmath58 is proportional to either @xmath189 or @xmath190 in some region of the pump wavelength in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ( a ) .",
    "when the pump pulse is in the visible region ( @xmath237800  nm ) , the probe polarization and @xmath58 oscillate as @xmath189 .",
    "this property is independent of temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ( b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the pump pulse is in the near - infrared region ( 10001100  nm ) , the probe polarization and @xmath58 oscillate as @xmath190 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the visible and near - infrared light pulses dominantly induce spin precession via ife and icme , respectively .",
    "a number of reasons can be given for why the dominant effect varies with pump wavelength .",
    "ife is induced by a pulse whose wavelength is near the transition @xmath155 @xmath154 at 700 nm . on the other hand ,",
    "icme is induced by a pulse whose wavelength is near the transition @xmath155 @xmath156 at 1000 nm . in addition , the faraday rotation angle increases with decreasing wavelength in dyfeo@xmath0.@xcite this tendency agrees with the result for the ife .",
    "we have studied the dependence of photoinduced spin precession in dyfeo@xmath0 on the wavelength and polarization of a pump pulse with a pump  probe magneto - optical technique .",
    "the polarization rotation of the probe pulse was dependent on the pump polarization .",
    "pulses propagating along the @xmath22-axis with both circular and linear polarizations induced an effective magnetic field ( ife and icme ) and spin precession .",
    "the dominant component of the dielectric permittivity in both effects was @xmath238 , and ife and icme were induced by its antisymmetric and symmetric parts @xmath139 and @xmath239 , respectively .",
    "the phase and amplitude of the spin precession were dependent on the pump wavelength in dyfeo@xmath0 .",
    "a difference in the pump wavelength changes the dominant effect , giving rise to the spin precession . a visible pulse ( wavelength @xmath237800  nm ) induced the ife , and the oscillation of the probe polarization was proportional to @xmath240 . on the other hand , a near - infrared pulse ( wavelength of 10001100  nm ) induced the icme dominantly , and the oscillation was proportional to @xmath241 . when the pump wavelength was near the electron transition @xmath155 @xmath154 at 700 nm and @xmath155 @xmath156 at 1000 nm , the amplitude of the oscillation was larger than that of the other region .",
    "the ratio of the effective magnetic fields via ife and icme , @xmath236 , is expected to be large enough for orthoferrites . however , the ellipticity of spin precession with af - mode is also so large .",
    "therefore , even though linearly polarized light pulse induces so weaker magnetic field than circularly polarized one , icme can give the same order contribution as ife .",
