    "after the recent advances in the nanostructuring of surfaces , polymers can now be end - grafted on nanometer scale structures @xcite .",
    "the recent progress in the production of nanoscale polymer structures has , however , only partially been matched by advances in the experimental methods of measuring the properties of such systems @xcite .",
    "available contactless methods , for example , optical methods , average the brush properties over areas that are larger than the nanoscale so that fine spatial resolution is lost . to retain sufficient spatial resolution , atomic force microscopy ( afm )",
    "is conventionally used @xcite .",
    "however , the necessary contact between the afm tip and the polymer thin layer distorts the layer and thus the object that it intends to study @xcite .",
    "afm measurements of polymers , tethered on surfaces with various geometries , illustrate a more general and fundamental class of problems , namely , the response of soft matter to external forces .",
    "polymer brushes , that is , densely packed arrays of polymer chains end - attached to an interface , have been studied extensively ( for reviews see @xcite ) due to their ability to modify surface properties , prevent colloid aggregation , and enhance lubrication or adhesion @xcite . when properly designed , polymer brushes in good solvent conditions have been shown to remarkably reduce friction @xcite .",
    "the brush structure and its properties can be controlled by tuning the grafting density , and variation of polymer molecular weight , temperature , and solvent quality @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical @xcite , experimental @xcite , and simulational @xcite studies have examined the structure and properties of polymer brushes . there exist , however , sometimes significant differences between the theoretical and the experimental investigations of polymer brushes .",
    "so most theories assume strong stretching of polymer chains in the brush , while it is hard for an experimentalist to achieve densities high enough so as to meet this assumption @xcite .",
    "the polydisperse nature of the synthesized brushes poses another significant difference .",
    "while it is practically impossible for an experimentalist to produce a perfectly monodisperse polymer brush , to the best of our knowledge , most of the theoretical works so far have not taken into consideration the intrinsic polydispersity of the brushes with a realistic chain length distribution , see , however , the early work of milner et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the interaction between an afm tip and a nanodesigned polymer brush bears resemblance to the problems mentioned above .",
    "previous works on the interaction between a uniformly grafted polymer brush and an external object usually neglected effects of polydispersity and high grafting density of the tethered chains @xcite even though the properties of living polymers in the bulk have been considered by flory @xcite , wheeler @xcite , pfeuty @xcite and others .",
    "a step toward understanding the role of polydispersity in soft matter outdoor response was done by the investigation of `` equilibrium polymers '' ( ep ) as summarized in @xcite .",
    "eps ( or , living polymers ) denote polymer solutions where the chains are dynamic objects with the unique feature of constantly fluctuating lengths .",
    "subject to external perturbation , concentration , or temperature change , they are able to respond via polymerization - depolymerization reactions allowing new thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium to be established .",
    "an important example of such constant process of dynamic equilibrium between polymers and their respective building units is that of surfactant molecules forming long flexible cylindrical aggregates , the so called wormlike giant micelles ( gm ) @xcite , which break and recombine constantly at random points along the sequence .",
    "eps are intrinsically polydisperse and their molecular weight distribution ( mwd ) in equilibrium is expected @xcite to follow an exponential decay with chain length .",
    "an efficient way to create polymer brushes is the growth of living polymer chains from active sites on a surface whereby brushes with given polydispersity index and grafting density can be synthesized @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest works investigating theoretically the growth of polymer chains from a surface was carried out by wittmer _ et .",
    ", @xcite , combining elements of diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite with the theory of polydisperse strongly stretched polymer brushes @xcite .",
    "generalizing the `` needle growth '' problem @xcite , they considered the formation of the brush as a particular case of diffusion - limited aggregation without branching ( dlawb ) .",
    "the interaction between a polydisperse grafted layer , commonly referred to as living polymer brush ( lpb ) , and an afm tip is similar to that of a polymer layer with a particle of mesoscopic size .",
    "a theoretical discussion of the latter has already been presented by subramanian _",
    "_ , @xcite .",
    "their treatment considered both dense brush ( high grafting density ) and mushroom ( low grafting density ) regime . for fixed brushes , in which the anchoring points on the surface are immobile , they assumed that when the particle is pushed against the grafted chains , these chains undergo pure compression and do not splay .",
    "under such an assumption , the force of compression ( force @xmath12 divided by cross - sectional area of the compressing particle @xmath13 ) per unit area , @xmath14 , does not depend on the radius of the compressing particle and is identical to the force for a brush pressed by a flat ( infinite radius ) plate . in the mushroom regime",
    ", they allowed the chains to deform and escape compression , and in this case subramanian _ et .",
    ", @xcite found that the chains do splay to the side to avoid being compressed .",
    "a nanopatterned polydisperse polymer brush , however , is a much more complex system as its distributed correlation length is of the same order as the size of the system .",
    "therefore , the brush can evade to the side , which is impossible for the monodisperse grafted brush , making the nanopatterned polydisperse brush effectively `` softer '' .",
    "the force measured in an afm experiment is rarely the quantity that one is ultimately interested in .",
    "the noteworthy exception to this statement are studies of the chemical nature of the brush surface where the degree of sticking is the sought - after information @xcite . in most other cases ,",
    "the measured force @xmath12 first has to be converted , or `` gauged '' , to yield , for example , the brush density @xmath15 .",
    "however , already for a homogeneously monodisperse polymer brush , computing the density @xmath15 is not possible from the knowledge of the force _ f _ alone - instead , additional information about the brush is needed @xcite , such as its grafting density , @xmath16 , and this information frequently might not be available .",
    "still , for the case of monodisperse polymer brush , a relation between @xmath12 and @xmath15 always exists and it also does not depend on the transversal position of the afm tip .",
    "all of this changes when a polydisperse polymer brush is considered instead .",
    "even for the same brush , identical values of the force @xmath12 now correspond to different values of the density @xmath15 ( or some other quantity of interest ) .",
    "this hinders a deeper understanding of the polymer brush properties via direct interpretation of afm results .",
    "thus , the need to understand the response of polydisperse polymer brushes to local external forces is both fundamental and practical . in this communication ,",
    "we first grow the polydisperse living polymer brush ( lpb ) _ in situ _ , monomer by monomer , from a functionalized seed carrying polymerization initiators , that is representative for a wider range of realistic systems .",
    "we then perform coarse grained off - lattice monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite of the interaction between the polydisperse living brush and a piston as representative for the afm tip .",
    "the simulations represent roughly @xmath17 g / mol chains ( @xmath18 coarse - grained monomers per chain ) over a range of grafting densities .",
    "the high grafting densities examined in this study are achievable experimentally by `` grafting from '' techniques such as atom transfer radical polymerization ( atrp ) @xcite .",
    "anticipating , we observe good agreement between simulational and experimental force - distance relationships .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in the next section [ sec_theory ]",
    "we sketch briefly the basis of the analytical treatment of lpb and the principal properties of living polymer brushes . in section [ model_mc ]",
    "we introduce the monte carlo model , employed in our study , and elucidate the salient features of the underlying algorithm .",
    "the steric repulsion exerted on an impenetrable and semi - permeable wall in compression experiments with _ in situ _ grown lpb are presented in section [ sec_results ] . in this section , we ask what happens when a layer of polydisperse polymer chains , grafted to a planar substrate by special groups , is subjected to external force ( such a afm tip ) .",
    "we also examine the effect of keeping the concentration of single non - grafted monomers in the box constant by using a semi - permeable wall so that the mean degree of polymerization in the brush does not change when the wall is moved . in the next section [ sec_comparison ] ,",
    "the comparison between experiment and simulation is presented in more detail in view of our own experimental data obtained from colloidal probe afm measurements .",
    "we briefly discuss the physical significance of the conversion factors for chain conformation sizes and length scales in real application , from the simulation to experiment .",
    "eventually , in the last section , [ sec_summary ] , we end this work by a brief summary of our findings .",
    "on a coarse - grained level , systems of living polymers are characterized by the monomer volume fraction @xmath15 , the energy difference @xmath19 between saturated and unsaturated bond states , the persistence length @xmath20 , and the excluded volume size @xmath21 of the monomer . for chains that are long compared to persistence length @xmath20 , reversibility of the self - assembly process",
    "ensures that the molecular weight distribution ( mwd ) @xmath22 of the polymeric species is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "polymer brushes are usually created by means of surface - initiated polymerization @xcite and are characterized by non - negligible polydispersity @xcite .",
    "a large variety of synthetic routes for the generation of polymer brushes includes , e.g. , ionic- @xcite , ring - opening- ( rop ) @xcite , atom transfer radical- ( atrp ) @xcite , and reversible addition - fragmentation chain transfer- ( raft ) @xcite polymerization .    most frequently in living polymers",
    "one observes a flory - schulz molecular weight distribution ( mwd ) distribution of chain lengths : @xmath23 where @xmath22 is the fraction of chains with length @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the probability that a monomer has reacted , @xmath26 is the molecular weight of a monomer , and @xmath27 - the number - averaged molecular weight .",
    "physically , eq .  ( [ eq : length_dist ] ) reflects a case when the reactivity of building units is independent of macromolecular weight .    in the case of dilute chains in the bulk , it has been shown that the mwd takes the form of schulz - zimm distribution @xcite @xmath28 and an mean chain length is given by @xmath29 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c_sz ] ) - ( [ eq : mean_l ] one has @xcite @xmath30 whereby @xmath31 in three dimensions .    in living polymers",
    "the semi - dilute conditions correspond to the case @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 mark the mean chain length and the density at crossover regime .",
    "eventually , proceeding as in the ideal case , one may recover in the semi - dilute case a simple exponential expression for the molecular weight distribution , @xmath36 with a slightly different expression for the average polymer length @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "turning now from living polymers in the bulk to a living polymer brush ( lpb ) , one retains the unique feature that the chains are dynamic objects with constantly fluctuating lengths .",
    "subject to external perturbation , _",
    "inter alia _ to pressure through a piston , they are able to respond dynamically via polymerization - depolymerization reactions allowing new thermodynamic equilibrium to be attained . here",
    "we consider a typical case of living ionic polymerization whereby chains grow from _ initiators _ , fixed on a grafting plane , by end - monomer mediated attachment - detachment events whereby the total number of chains remains constant .    making use of scaling considerations @xcite , one may try to predict the power law exponents that govern lpb structure under various conditions . in the simplest case of",
    "dilute non - overlapping living polymers ( mushrooms ) , tethered to a plane in a good solvent , one expects @xmath39 with the exponent @xmath40 where the universal surface exponent @xmath41 .",
    "hence , one expects to find a weakly singular @xmath42 .",
    "thus , in a weakly stretched polymer brush at low grafting density @xmath16 , when the living polymers do not overlap strongly , the excluded volume interactions are expected to favor longer chains which can explore broader regions of the living polymer brush",
    ". this would lead to a power law mwd ( plus exponential cutoff ) . therefore ,",
    "for a self - similar mushroom structure of the living polymer brush with blob size @xmath43 the monomer density would scale as @xmath44 . the chain - end density , like the blob density , @xmath45 with @xmath46 . since @xmath47 ,",
    "one readily finds a power - law distribution , @xmath3 with @xmath48 .",
    "in contrast , assuming that the polymer brush may be viewed as a compact layer of concentration blobs @xmath49 , within the alexander - de gennes picture of a strongly stretched brush ( the so called strong stretching limit - ssl ) , the chains are described within the self - consistent field theory approach ( scft ) as classical trajectories , that are strongly stretched at distances , larger than @xmath50 . if scaling holds , one may then use power - law functions to express @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as in the case of the weak stretching limit . assuming that in the ssl a living polymer brush may be considered as grown by diffusion - limited aggregation ( dlawb ) without branching , one obtains then set of exponents",
    "@xcite as @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can verify that these theoretical predictions agree well with earlier mc simulation results @xcite and our present observations ( see below ) of a dense lpb in equilibrium .",
    "given that the dlawb model @xcite pertains to a steady state process of brush growth under irreversible polymerization in conditions of adiabatically slow influx of free monomers , this result appears somewhat surprising .",
    "even , if one could provide some arguments that the structure of a steadily growing needle forest under certain conditions may be viewed as close to that of a lpb in dynamic equilibrium , the two cases clearly differ , and this interesting result ( whose study is beyond the scope of the present study ) certainly needs special investigation .",
    "regarding the force , exerted by a polymer brush on a plane at distance @xmath54 from the grafting surface , the problem was first considered using the alexander - de gennes @xcite model , one assumes that the force is strictly zero for @xmath55 , ( corresponding to zero osmotic pressure at the outer end of the brush ) . using a flory type argument ,",

    "therefore , one can estimate that the effective height @xmath70 ( e.g. , for a narrow uniform molecular weight distribution ) increases as a square root of the variance @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "accordingly , at small compression the repulsive force of the polydisperse brush increases and is always larger than that of a monodisperse polymer brush with chains of length equal to the mean length of the polydisperse brush @xmath73 . at large compression",

    "for a broad distribution @xmath22 , cf .",

    "we use a coarse grained off - lattice bead spring model to describe the polymer chains in our two systems : lpb and mpb . as far as for many applications in a biological context",
    "rather short grafted chains are used @xcite , and in order to do a reasonable comparison , we restrict ourselves to the range of @xmath74 and @xmath75 at various grafting densities @xmath16 in the cases of lpb and mpb , respectively .      for the off - lattice version presented here we have now harnessed a very efficient bead - spring algorithm for polymer chains ( for technical details",
    "@xcite ) and this off - lattice scheme is characterized by the bonded and non - bonded interactions shown in figure  [ model]a .",
    "it is clear that in a system of ep where scission and recombination of bonds constantly take place , the particular scheme of bookkeeping should be no trivial matter @xcite .",
    "since self - assembled ep chains are only transient objects the data structure of the chains can only be based on the individual monomers or , rather , on the saturated or unsaturated bonds of each monomer @xcite .",

    "it is further imposed that in the state in which living polymerization and depolymerization events take place simultaneously ( figure  [ model]b ) , the polymerizing monomer is located within the region of low intermolecular energy determined by a suitable bonding potential . note that active chain ends do not react ( recombine ) with one another .     and depolymerization @xmath78 : chains consists of successively connected bonds , labeled by pointers . the pointers of end - bonds point to _ nil _ ( red particles ) .",

    "the two possible bonds of each monomer _ imon _ are called _ ibond _ = _ imon _ and _ ibond _ = _ -imon_. no specific meaning ( or direction ) is attached to the sign and this is merely a convenience for finding the monomer from the bond list : _ imon _ = @xmath84 .",

    "unsaturated bonds at chain ends point to _ nil _ ( nowhere ) and only these bonds may recombine ( pair ) with the unsaturated bond of a free monomer .",
    "therefore , the main difference with respect to eps is that the monomer may attach or dissociate reversibly only to / from end - monomers of grafted lpb chains ( following the model definition sketched in figure  [ scheme ] ) and no explicit distinction between the end - monomers , middle monomers or free monomers is required .     and the activation barrier are independent of the monomer position ( along the chain contour as well as in space ) and density .",

    "square average local monomer density and @xmath271 is excluded volume interaction parameter .",
    "if we choose for the description of the mean local density @xmath272 a gaussian function , with a radius of gyration @xmath273 , we obtain @xmath274 eventually , one may choose the ideal state with vanishing excluded volume forces and coil size in thermal equilibrium @xmath275 , where @xmath276 and @xmath277 , and replace @xmath273 by @xmath64 assuming @xmath278 .",
    "thus one may express @xmath266 as @xmath279 the parameter @xmath280 , is dimensionless and determines the excluded volume energy associated with a single chain .",
    "a further requirement is that one needs an expression to take into account the conformational entropy indicating the elastic force built up on a coil expansion .",
    "this equation yields the second part of the free energy , @xmath267 , and is given by @xmath281 finally , combination of the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f_p_e ] ) and ( [ eq : f_p_s ] ) yields the free energy of a chain as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "one may determine the important relation between @xmath282 and the degree of polymerization @xmath24 by calculating the equilibrium value of @xmath64 at the minimum of the free energy @xmath265 , where @xmath283 .",
    "@xmath275 is the coil size in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this leads to the relation @xmath284 .",
    "one may identify @xmath64 with the flory radius @xmath282 and it can be represented thus as @xmath285 with @xmath286 .",
    "the scaling law eq .  ( [ eq : fit ] ) is indeed in full accord with experiments ( e.g. , see ref 94 ) and it can be used for the translation of experimental findings to results of simulation in the case of various expanded polymer system in a good solvent .",
    "of particular interest , we applied the same criteria in order to map our coarse - grained level simulations of force - displacement curve of a lpb to the experimental results obtained by sfa experiment ( see figure  [ exper - simul ] ) and own colloidal probe afm analysis on pnipaam brush in the good solvent .",
    "since in the case of lpb system , there is only a single factor relating the length scale of the simulation to the real length scale and leads to a mapping process that conserves the chain conformation during translation , it can be expected that the precise description of coarse - grained model for force - displacement curve in figure  [ exper - simul ] is restricted to special cases . as an example",
    ", figure  [ exper - simul - owndata ] presents the force - displacement behavior in a afm analysis for the pairs ( @xmath287 @xmath252/chain)@xmath288 , and ( @xmath289 @xmath252/chain)@xmath288 .",
    "all force data are normalized by the colloidal tip radius @xmath290 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ exper - simul - owndata ] , we find the closest corresponding translated pairs in simulation data as ( @xmath291)@xmath292 , and ( @xmath293)@xmath292 . the inset in figure  [ exper - simul - owndata](a ) shows that for very small compressions , the semi - log plot of the force - displacement curve deviates somewhat from the coarse - grained model and near @xmath294  the simulation curve @xmath295 slightly underestimates the experimental data . as shown in the inset to figure  [ exper - simul - owndata](b ) , in the case of lower degree of polymerization , @xmath296 , the same deviation is also observed for lower separations while the underestimation is slightly decreased .",
    "in the present work we have studied and tried to reproduce the force exerted by a lpb chains on a test surface .",
    "our studies have been carried out by means of an efficient off - lattice monte carlo algorithm . to this end",
    "comprehensive monte carlo simulations of the properties of a lpb made of flexible living polymer chains under good solvent conditions have been carried out .",
    "most of our studies consider moderate and high grafting densities of the chains whereby the ensuing polymer brush may be classified as strongly stretched .",
    "an examination of the static properties of such lpb suggests that the observed monomer density profiles reveal power - law decline of the density @xmath0 with increasing distance @xmath2 perpendicular to the grafting plane , @xmath297 with @xmath4 which is very close to the theoretically predicted value of @xmath6 for diffusion - limited aggregation @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath22 of chain lengths @xmath24 in the strongly polydisperse living polymer brush is also found to follow a power law relationship , @xmath3 , which qualitatively differs from the exponential flory - schulz molecular weight distribution typical for living polymers in the bulk .",
    "the observed value of @xmath5 is again rather close to the value of @xmath7 , predicted for the case of  needle growth ",
    "( diffusion - limited aggregation without branching ) @xcite , except for cases of rather short lpbs , grown at high temperature @xmath298 , where the chains do not stretch strongly and an exponential mwd is observed .",
    "one may thus conclude that the static properties of a lpb at equilibrium are very different from those of a semi - dilute or dense solution of living polymers in the bulk , and are governed by different laws .",
    "one of the main concerns of this work has been the study of the force , exerted by a lpb on a test surface , and the comparison of simulational data with that from our own and other laboratory experiments .",
    "we have compared the force - displacement behavior from the set of experiments @xcite , obtained by sfa analysis on pnipaam brush under good solvent condition at temperature below lcst of pnipaam ( figure  [ exper - simul ] ) , and also our own experimental results obtained by colloidal probe afm measurements on pnipaam brush at same conditions of sfa ( figure  [ exper - simul - owndata ] ) with data from the present simulation . generally , by adjusting the conformational parameter @xmath299 and the conversion factor from model lattice spacings to realistic nanometer scale , we find an almost perfect agreement . small deviations between simulation results and experiment are only found for weak compression where in the case of sfa measurements , the simulation slightly overestimates the data and in the case of afm experiments , the simulation slightly underestimates them .",
    "it is clear , however , that more work is needed until full understanding of the properties of living polymer brushes , obtained by atrp is achieved . especially interesting and unexplored is the problem of lpbs , grown on curved surfaces , including the corresponding force - distance relationship which we see as our next target for research .",

    "<S> , the monomer density profile @xmath0 of the lpb is found to decline as @xmath1 with the distance from the grafting plane @xmath2 , while the distribution of chain lengths in the brush scales as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured values @xmath4 and @xmath5 are very close to those , predicted within the framework of the diffusion - limited aggregation theory , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . at varying mean degree of polymerization ( from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) and effective grafting density ( from @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) , we observe a nearly perfect agreement in the force - distance behavior of the simulated lpb with own experimental data obtained from colloidal probe afm analysis on pnipaam brush and with data obtained by plunkett _ et . </S>",
