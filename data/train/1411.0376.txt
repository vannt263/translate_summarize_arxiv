    "resonance @xmath9 was experimentally observed @xcite , but its quantum number is still to be eventually identified because the ratio @xmath10 is not well understood @xcite .",
    "a careful reexamination on the spectrum peak around 2.86 gev recently has been carried out by the lhcb collaboration and it is found that a spin-1 state and a spin-3 state overlap under the peak .",
    "they are @xmath0 with mass and width as @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath1 with mass and width as @xmath12@xcite . based on the new data godfrey and",
    "moats suggest that @xcite @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be identified as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "previously @xmath4@xcite was measured and its mass and width are @xmath13 .",
    "it was assigned to be @xmath8 or @xmath7 or their mixture @xcite .",
    "obviously the @xmath8 assignment of @xmath4 conflicts with the lhcb s new observation , because the @xmath8 state of @xmath14 is occupied by @xmath0 , so there is no room to accommodate @xmath4 . therefore one can conjecture that as long as @xmath0 is in the @xmath8 state , @xmath4 should be regarded as a @xmath7 state or others@xcite . since all resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 and @xmath4 have been undoubtedly reconstructed in the hadronic processes under investigation , the best channels to determine their quantum identities are their respective strong decays@xcite which are in fact the dominant ones .",
    "however , on other aspect , one still has a chance to observe the resonances in their electromagnetic decays where excited states transit into ground states by emitting a photon .",
    "especially the calculation on the electromagnetic decays is more reliable . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors study the radiative decays of @xmath15@xmath16 and @xmath15@xmath17 into a p - wave @xmath14 meson . in this paper",
    "we will study the radiative decay of a d - wave meson into an s - wave @xmath14 meson .",
    "the results may help us to determine the quantum number of these particles in addition to the studies via strong processes .",
    "in this work , we employ the light - front quark model(lfqm ) to estimate the branching ratios .",
    "this relativistic model has been thoroughly discussed in literatures @xcite and applied to study hadronic transition processes@xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this framework qualitatively agree with the data for all the concerned processes .    in conventional lfqm the radiative decay of a @xmath18 ( s - wave ) meson into a @xmath19 meson",
    "was evaluated @xcite and the same formula can also be generalized to the covariant lfqm @xcite . in our earlier papers@xcite we studied radiative decays of some mesons in covariant lfqm and now we will concentrate our attention to the radiative decays of @xmath18 ( d - wave ) mesons to @xmath19 mesons",
    ". the results would be useful for confirming the identities of the aforementioned mesons .",
    "since the lorentz structure of the vertex functions of d - wave is the same as that of s - wave @xcite , the formulas for decays of the @xmath18 d - wave mesons can be simply obtained by replacing several functions which were used for the decays of the @xmath18 s - wave mesons .",
    "this paper is organized as following : after this introduction , we derive the theoretical formulas in next section where we also present relevant formulas given in literatures , and then in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results along with all inputs which are needed for the numerical computations . in the last section",
    "we draw our conclusion and make a brief discussion .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     after @xmath4 was found , a lot of work has been done to investigate its identity . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors suggested that @xmath4 should be a @xmath7 state , rather than a @xmath8 . to be more open , here let us assume @xmath4 to be respectively a @xmath20 state or a @xmath8 state and under the different assumptions , we calculate its radiative decay width .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab : expect ] . for the s - wave state ( @xmath20 )",
    "we employ the conventional wave function ( s - wave(1 ) ) and modified wave function ( s - wave(2 ) ) which was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "then we continue to calculate the rate of radiative decay of the d - wave state in the aforementioned approximation .",
    "one would notice that there exists a huge gap between the s - wave and d - wave cases .",
    "if we assume that @xmath4 is the mixture of @xmath20 and @xmath8 i.e. @xmath21@xcite , using the values of @xmath22 given in table ( [ tab : expect ] ) the corresponding radiative decay width is re - calculated . in fig.[mix ] the dependence of the decay width on the mixing angle @xmath23 is depicted where the modified wavefunction is used for the 2s state .",
    "in ref.@xcite the authors studied @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 which are @xmath28kev , @xmath29 kev , @xmath30 kev and @xmath31 kev respectively . the above cited estimates",
    "are about radiative decays of @xmath32 into a p - wave meson plus a photon , as we noted that for finally identifying the quantum numbers of @xmath32 , the decay mode under investigation : @xmath33 which is @xmath32 decaying into a s - wave meson plus a photon , is not less important .",
    "in this work we study the radiative decay of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 respectively in terms of lfqm . assuming @xmath0 , @xmath1 to be @xmath8 and @xmath34 states , we obtain their partial widths .",
    "our estimates on @xmath35 and @xmath35 are approximately @xmath36 kev",
    ". the estimated branching ratios of the radiative decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are about 1.9@xmath37 and 5.8 @xmath38 . by",
    "the achieved integrated luminosity at lhcb ( 3.0 fb@xmath39 ) , the lhcb collaboration@xcite collected 12450 @xmath40 samples where only a part of the events concern @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "their radiative decays have not been observed yet due to the small database for @xmath9 .",
    "indeed we need longer time and higher luminosity to observe the radiative decays @xmath35 and @xmath35 .",
    "though the fractions of the radiative decays are small , they have clear signal to be observed from the background , therefore the advantage of detecting those modes is obvious .",
    "thus we expect our experimental colleagues to carry out accurate experiments to measure them .",
    "concerning @xmath4 , as discussed in the introduction , if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are confirmed to be the d - wave @xmath41 meson , @xmath4 can not be a pure 1d - wave @xmath14 system , we calculate its radiative decay rate by assuming two possible assignments : @xmath20 or @xmath8 respectively .",
    "our numerical results show that if it is a @xmath20 state the corresponding branching ratio is about 5.2 @xmath426.7 @xmath43 , instead while it is @xmath8 , the corresponding rate is around 1.5 @xmath37 .",
    "there is an obvious gap between the estimated rates for the two assignments .",
    "because the lfqm is a relativistic model and its validity is widely recognized due to its success for explaining the available data for hadronic decays of heavy mesons , we may believe that the numerical results obtained in this framework is trustworthy , at most they could only decline from the real values by a small factor less than 2 which was confirmed by other phenomenological studies in terms of the same model .",
    "the possible uncertainties are incurred by the inputs .",
    "even so , the results could help identifying the quantum numbers since in the two cases the resultant ratios of @xmath44 are apparently apart .",
    "no doubt , the final decision will be made by the future precise measurements . our work only indicates the importance of studying the radiative decays because of their obvious advantage and strongly suggest to search such decay modes at the coming super - belle or next run of lhcb , even the expected ilc .",
