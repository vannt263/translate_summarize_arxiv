    "hot molecules exist in many environments in space including cool stars @xcite , failed stars generally known as brown dwarfs @xcite and exoplanets @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric properties of these objects are known to be strongly influenced by the spectra of the molecules they contain . on earth , spectra of hot molecules",
    "are observed in flames @xcite , discharge plasmas @xcite , explosions @xcite and in the hot gases emitted , for example , from smoke stacks @xcite .",
    "in addition , high - lying states can be important in non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) environments both in space , for example , emissions observed from comets @xcite , and on earth .",
    "the spectra of key atmospheric molecules at room temperature have been the subject of systematically maintained databases such as hitran @xcite and geisa @xcite . as will be amply illustrated below ,",
    "the spectra of hot molecules contain many , many more transitions and so far attempts to compile systematic databases have been limited .",
    "databases of hot molecular spectra do exist for other specialized applications , such as the em2c database for combustion applications @xcite or one due to parigger _",
    "et al _  for studies of laser - induced plasmas @xcite .",
    "planets and cool stars share some common fundamental characteristics : they are faint , their radiation peaks in the infrared and their atmosphere is dominated by strong molecular absorbers . modelling planetary and stellar atmospheres",
    "is therefore difficult as their spectra are extremely rich in structure with hundreds of thousands to many billions of spectral lines which may be broadened by high - pressure and temperature effects .    the exomol project @xcite aims to provide the molecular line lists that astronomers need in order to understand the physics and chemistry of astronomical bodies cool enough to form molecules in their atmospheres . in particular for extrasolar planets , brown dwarfs and cool stars @xcite , as well as circumstellar structures such as planetary envelopes and molspheres @xcite .",
    "in practice these data are also useful for a wide range of other scientific disciplines ; examples include studies of the earth s atmosphere @xcite , hypersonic non - equilibrium @xcite , analysis of laboratory spectra @xcite , measurements of hot reactive gases @xcite and the proposed remote analysis of molecular composition using laser oblation @xcite .",
    "the original exomol data structure was very focused in its goal , with the scope of the data limited to generating lists of transitions @xcite .",
    "however , it has become obvious that the potential applications of the exomol spectroscopic data are much more diverse .",
    "for example , the exomol data can be used to compute partition functions @xcite , cross sections @xcite , lifetimes @xcite , land @xmath1-factors @xcite and other properties .",
    "our aim is to systematically provide this additional data to maximise its usefulness . to do this",
    "requires significant extension of the exomol data structure , which is the major purpose of this paper . at the same time",
    "this implementation should facilitate the adoption of an application programming interface ( api ) between the database and programs using it .",
    "similar enhancements are actively being pursued by other related databases such as hitran @xcite .",
    "a major new feature is the inclusion , albeit at a fairly crude level , of pressure - broadening parameters .",
    "these have been shown to be important for models of exoplanets @xcite and are known to be vital for many other applications .",
    "section 2 summarizes current data coverage of the exomol database .",
    "section 3 reviews the individual line lists included in the database with particular emphasis on any changes made to them since they were originally published .",
    "section 4 describes the expansion of data that is now provided by the exomol database .",
    "section 5 gives a formal description of the new data structures implemented to cover this provision and to provide the api functionality .",
    "section 6 briefly describes the utility programs available as part of the exomol database and section 7 the exomol website .",
    "finally we discuss future prospects for the database .",
    "the exomol project aims at complete coverage of the spectroscopic properties of molecules which are deemed to be important in hot astrophysical environments .",
    "coverage concerns ( a ) the molecular species considered , including isotopologues ; ( b ) the frequency range considered and ( c ) the upper temperature range for which the data is reasonably complete .",
    "both the required temperature and frequency range completeness are to some extent a judgement on what is required for astronomical and other studies .",
    "for example , a molecule like nitric acid ( hno@xmath3 ) will dissociate at a relatively low temperature so coverage above about 500 k is unlikely to be important . on the other hand ,",
    "several diatomics such sio and co are known to feature in stellar spectra , and coverage to temperatures over 6000 k is necessary .",
    "the general exomol approach is molecule - by - molecule .",
    "that is , a comprehensive line list is created for a particular molecule which is then made available in the database . for more challenging larger systems such as nh@xmath3 , ph@xmath3 and hno@xmath3 ,",
    "it has been our policy to produce initial , room - temperature line lists , see @xcite respectively .",
    "this allows us to improve the model , validate the available experimental data and , in some cases , make spectral assignments . in all instances , the subsequent hot line lists @xcite",
    "are both more complete and more accurate and should therefore be used even for studies at low temperatures .",
    "thus far exomol has not considered ultraviolet ( uv ) absorption ; however , there is increasing interest in the consequences of uv radiation on exoplanets @xcite so this may need to be reviewed in future .",
    "as discussed in the comments below , molecules are still being added to the database so that coverage by species is steadily increasing .",
    "tables [ tab : exomoldata ] and [ tab : otherdata ] summarize the molecules for which the exomol database currently provides data .",
    "the division is between species that have explicitly been studied as part of the exomol project ( table [ tab : exomoldata ] ) and those for which the data has been taken from other studies ( table [ tab : otherdata ] ) .",
    "the exomol project has a specific methodology based on the use of spectroscopically - determined potential energy surfaces and _ ab initio _",
    "dipole surfaces , which are combined with explicit variational treatments of the nuclear motion problem . for open shell systems",
    "these treatments involve explicit inclusion of spin - orbit and related curve - coupling effects ; the project has developed a nuclear motion program , duo , for treating coupled diatomic curves @xcite .",
    "for closed shell molecules a range of codes @xcite are used .",
    "these are all essentially based on finding near - exact solutions of the ro - vibrational schrdinger equation for a given potential energy surface but the level of approximation increases with the size of the molecule considered .",
    "data from other sources arise from a variety of methodologies which range from completely _ ab initio _ , appropriate for systems with very few electrons , to largely empirical .",
    "table [ tab : otherdata ] gives a pointer to the method used in each case ; for full details the reader should consult the cited reference .",
    ".datasets created by the exomol project and included in the exomol database .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^,>,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "as part of the database , exomol provides a number of sample utilities for manipulating data presented in the exomol format .",
    "this covers the most common applications of the line lists , such as computing absorption / emission cross sections @xcite or coefficients ( ` stick ' intensities ) , partition functions , cooling functions and lifetimes .",
    "these utilities are available as fortran  95 and python programs combined into an exocross package .",
    "exocross allows users to utilise different line profiles to generate cross - sections , including the voigt profile , using the line parameters compiled in the exomol database ( file ` .broad ` ) when available .",
    "other standard line profiles include the temperature - dependent doppler profile , rectangular - shape profiles ( i.e. averaged cross - sections over the wavenumber bin ) , as well as general gaussian and lorentzian profiles with line - widths as free input parameters .",
    "the utilities can be obtained directly from the exomol website together with examples of input files .    as mentioned above a python utility , ` extract__trans.py ` is provided which reads the ` .trans ` in ` .bz2 ` format without requiring it to be uncompressed .",
    "the molecular data produced by exomol is increasingly being used in a wide variety of applications . in",
    "many of these applications , pre - existing software packages utilise different data formats for their input files .",
    "the detailed specification of our format above should be sufficient to allow conversion to any required format using a suitable parser program .",
    "we have written a number of utility programs ( in python ) that convert the exomol format to other common formats .",
    "these can be used to produce the full line list in different formats such as hitran , for which the python utility ` exomol2hitran.py ` is available .",
    "oscillator strengths can be generated by the utility exomol2gf.py .",
    "however , we should stress that the exomol format is much more compact than most other alternatives ( notably hitran format ) , primarily due to the separation of information into the states and trans file .",
    "the size of the exomol line lists means that it can be prohibitive to store the full data in another format ; for example , the methane 10to10 line list would require 14 tb to be stored in hitran format .",
    "it is therefore recommended that the utility programs provided be integrated within the larger program , such that the new format data is produced for a small number of lines at a time which are immediately utilised by the program , thus avoiding the storage of data .",
    "the exomol website ( www.exomol.com ) is the main source of the exomol data .",
    "data can be accessed two ways : ( a ) by first selecting a molecule and then a specific isotopologue - dataset name combination or ( b ) by selecting a particular data type , such as partition function .",
    "we note that cross sections are also being made available via the virtual atomic and molecular data centre ( vamdc ) @xcite .",
    "this api takes the form of a `` table access protocol '' service at ` www.exomol.com/tap/sync ` .",
    "the exomol.all file described in section 5.2 is available at www.exomol.com/exomol.all and the data files comprising each dataset can be accessed at a url of the form ` www.exomol.com/db/<molformula>/<isoslug>/<dsname>/<filename > ` , for example ` www.exomol.com/db/sio/28si-16o/ebjt/28si-16o__ebjt.pf ` .",
    "a separate api for machine - access of the exomol data in the format described in this paper will be available at ` www.exomol.com/api ` and documented on the website .",
    "this will allow the automatic retrieval of data files by the ` http get ` method .",
    "the exomol database presented here is a molecule - by - molecule set of comprehensive line lists for modelling spectra and other properties of hot gases .",
    "the choice of molecules is dictated by the need to model the atmospheres of exoplanets and other hot astronomical objects , but the spectroscopic data have much wider applications than this .",
    "we are still in the process of adding molecules to the database and are receptive to suggestions of other key species to include . in particular the discovery @xcite and observation of spectra @xcite of very hot , rocky planets will undoubtedly lead to the consideration of novel species @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have significantly expanded the flexibility and scope of the data model used by exomol .",
    "the original exomol format of a ` .states ` and ` .trans ` file has been already adopted as a possible input format by some programs , such as pgopher @xcite .",
    "the extended format proposed here is both backward - compatible and designed to allow direct extraction of data from the database using an application programming interface ( api ) .",
    "we believe that this will be helpful to scientists and relieve them of the need to manually deal with datasets containing many billions of spectral lines .",
    "our new data structure allows the inclusion of important new molecular parameters including those to determine pressure broadening , state - resolved radiative lifetimes and land @xmath1-factors .",
