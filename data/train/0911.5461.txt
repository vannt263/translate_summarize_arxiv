    "dynamical friction of scs in galaxies have been discussed in many different contexts , such as formation of stellar galactic nuclei via merging of old gcs ( e.g. , tremaine et al . 1975 ) , transformation from non - nucleated dwarfs into nucleated ones ( e.g. , oh & lin 2000 ) , physical meanings for the presence of the gc system ( gcs ) in the fornax dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , oh et al .",
    "2001 ) , and dark matter distributions of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , hernandez & gilmore 1998 ; goerdt et al . 2006 ; inoue 2009 ) .",
    "orbital decay of gcs due to dynamical friction can significantly change spatial distribution of gcs and thus increase possibilities of them to be destroyed by strong galactic tidal fields ( e.g. , vesperini 2000 ) .",
    "dynamical friction of scs ( including gcs ) in galaxies is thus considered to be important for better understanding the evolution of gc luminosity functions ( gclfs ) and that of half - number radii of the gcss in galaxies ( e.g. , vesperini 2000 ) .",
    "recently , van de ven & chang ( 2009 ) have suggested the importance of dynamical friction in the dynamical evolution of scs around nuclear rings in galaxies .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "1 shows the time evolution of the projected distributions of scs for the last 0.64 gyr in the standard model with @xmath9 and with @xmath10 .",
    "the projected spatial distribution of scs can change with time not only because of the dynamical evolution of the disk but also because of dynamical friction of scs against the disk field stars .",
    "the half - number radius of the scs evolves from @xmath11 ( corresponding to @xmath12 kpc ) to @xmath13 ( @xmath14 kpc ) , which reflects that dynamical friction of scs can cause orbital decay of massive scs within the disk .",
    "the total number of scs within @xmath15 in the disk can gradually increase so that a multiple sc system with the total mass ( @xmath16 ) of @xmath17 can form in the nuclear region of the disk .",
    "the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20components of velocity dispersions of the multiple scs are 17.7 km s@xmath21 , 23.6 km s@xmath21 , and 3.2 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the velocity dispersions comparable to internal velocity dispersions of their nuclear massive scs suggest that the nuclear scs can soon merge to form a single nucleus .",
    "2 and 3 show orbital evolution projected onto the @xmath22-@xmath23 and @xmath22-@xmath24 planes for scs with two different masses . in both case , the distances from the center of the stellar disk ( @xmath25 ) become significantly smaller owing to orbital decay caused by dynamical friction against disk field stars .",
    "the extent to which a sc can decay its orbit owing to dynamical friction depends on its initial mass and location with respect to the center of its host galaxy : the scs with masses of @xmath26 and @xmath27 can decrease @xmath25 by 31% and 63% of their initial @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the orbit of the more massive sc , which is initially in the inner region of the disk , can be influenced also by the inner spirals and bar developed during the disk evolution so that the orbital evolution can become more chaotic .",
    "these orbital decay seen in these two scs can be more clearly seen in more massive scs owing to more effective dynamical friction for them ( see the appendix a for details of other scs orbits in the standard model ) .",
    "4 shows that about 60 % of the scs have final @xmath25 ( @xmath28 ) significantly smaller than initial @xmath25 ( @xmath29 ) owing to dynamical friction of the sc against disk field stars .",
    "spiral arms and bar in the disk can drive the angular momentum redistribution of the disk so that @xmath30 scs have @xmath31 : these are transferred to the outer regions of the disk by _ global galactic dynamics_. fig .",
    "4 also shows that more massive scs with @xmath32 are more likely to have smaller @xmath33 ( i.e. , more significant orbital decay due to dynamical friction ) .",
    "the mean @xmath33 for the 20 scs at @xmath34 gyr in this model is @xmath35 .",
    "5 shows that all scs can significantly decrease their @xmath36 ( corresponding to apo - center distances from the galaxy center ) owing to ( i ) dynamical friction and ( ii ) radial motions caused by non - axisymmetric structures ( bar and spiral arms ) .",
    "5 also shows that scs with smaller @xmath29 can experience more significant orbital decay ( i.e. , smaller @xmath37 ) due to dynamical friction , because dynamical friction is more effective in higher densities of background field stars .",
    "the mean @xmath37 for the 20 scs at @xmath34 gyr in this model is @xmath38 .",
    "6 shows the time evolution of the total mass of scs ( in units of @xmath1 ) within @xmath39 , which is referred to as @xmath40 for convenience .",
    "this @xmath40 does not literally correspond to the mass of a single stellar nucleus and thus goes up and down rapidly according to time evolution of their orbits .",
    "clearly , around @xmath41 gyr , @xmath42 can exceed the value of 0.003 observed for nucleated dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster ( ct et al .",
    "this relatively rapid formation of a multiple sc system is due to very efficient dynamical friction of massive scs with the mean mass of @xmath43 in the disk .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of @xmath42 depends strongly on the adopted initial mass function of scs ( this point is discussed later ) .",
    "dynamical friction processes of scs in disk galaxies depend strongly on model parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 ( = @xmath47 ) , central stellar densities of disks , and @xmath48 . the derived @xmath1-dependence is the most important result in the present study so that it is briefly summarized in the table 2 .",
    "we illustrate the derived dependences on model parameters as follows :    \\(i ) orbital decay of scs due to dynamical friction is more important in less massive host galaxies , mainly because relative velocities ( @xmath49 ) between scs and disk field stars ( which are comparable to stellar velocity dispersions of the disks ) are smaller in the galaxies : the frictional drag force can be proportional to @xmath49 ( see 7.18 in binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "7 shows that @xmath33 is systematically smaller in disk galaxies with smaller @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath50 .",
    "7 also shows that for disks with @xmath51 , no / few scs can show significant orbital decay ( @xmath52 ) , which means that dynamical friction of scs is not so important in their orbital evolution .",
    "\\(ii ) dynamical friction of scs by disk field stars is less effective in galaxies with smaller @xmath50 , mainly because stellar densities of disk field stars are lower so that frictional drag force can be weaker .",
    "8 shows that for disks with @xmath53 , only a few scs can show significant orbital decay ( @xmath52 ) , which implies that dynamical friction of scs can not be so important in orbital evolution of scs in the early phase of disk evolution of galaxies when the mass fractions of disk stars can be very small .",
    "8 also shows that a smaller fraction of scs have @xmath54 , which reflects that radial redistribution of scs due to the presence of non - axisymmetric structures ( spirals and bars ) does not happen in galaxies with smaller degrees of self - gravitating .",
    "\\(iii ) galactic bulges appear to be less important in orbital decay of scs within disks in comparison with other galactic properties such as @xmath1 and @xmath50 .",
    "8 shows no remarkable differences between models with different @xmath47 ( = 0.17 and 1.0 ) , though @xmath47 can be an important parameter which determines whether stellar bars can form and thus affect orbital evolution of scs .",
    "\\(iv ) the time scale of dynamical friction of scs by disk field stars is longer in lsbs than in hsbs , because stellar densities of background field stars can be key factors for the effectiveness of dynamical friction . as a result of this , formation of stellar nuclei via sc merging",
    "can proceed more slowly in lsbs .",
    "for example , @xmath40 can become @xmath55 only after 2.4gyr orbital evolution of scs in the lsb model in which @xmath56 is by a factor of 2.5 larger than that in the standard model ( and other model parameters are the same as those in the standard model ) .",
    "\\(v ) final properties of scss ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) and the formation processes of nuclear multiple scs ( thus nucleus formation processes ) in galaxies depend on initial mfs ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath57 can evolve more rapidly and have smaller final values in models with smaller @xmath58 ( i.e. , larger @xmath16 for the most massive scs ) in the present study ( e.g. , @xmath59 for models with @xmath60 mag ) .",
    "also final @xmath40 is larger in models with smaller @xmath61 ( e.g. , @xmath62 for @xmath63 mag ) .",
    "this result implies that formation processes of stellar galactic nuclei ( e.g. , whether dwarfs are nucleated or non - nucleated ) depend on original mfs of scs in galaxies .",
    "the present study has first shown that more massive scs can spiral - in to the nuclear regions of galactic disks owing to dynamical friction within less than @xmath64 gyr in low - mass disk galaxies .",
    "it is highly likely that these multiple scs in nuclear regions of disk galaxies can merge with one another to form stellar galactic nuclei ( or single massive nuclear scs ) .",
    "if this is the case , then the merged scs ( i.e. , stellar galactic nuclei or nuclear scs ) would not be identified as ordinary scs in observations .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful for the present study to investigate scmfs located within @xmath65 for comparing the simulated scmfs with the observed ones . in the followings ,",
    "we assume that mfs are for scs located within @xmath65 ( i.e. , excluding the nuclear scs in the simulations ) .",
    "9 shows that no scs with @xmath66 can be seen in the final mf for the standard model , because more massive scs spiral - in to nuclear regions of disk galaxies more rapidly owing to dynamical friction of scs against disk field stars .",
    "this result implies that mfs of scs for @xmath67 ( i.e. , higher - mass end ) can steepen significantly in comparison of their original mfs ( at the epoch of sc formation ) owing to dynamical friction of scs .",
    "furthermore , given that dynamical friction of scs against disk field stars is more effective in less massive disk galaxies , the mfs can more significantly steepen in less massive disk galaxies .",
    "thus , it is highly likely that the scmfs can be steeper in less massive disk galaxies .    based on observational studies of gclfs for the early - type galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey , jordn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the gcmfs for relatively high masses ( @xmath68 ) are steeper in less luminous galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "they suggested that since gcmfs are not strongly affected by dynamical evolution of gcs ( e.g. , dynamical friction ) over a hubble time , the steeper gcmfs arise from variations in initial conditions .",
    "our results however imply that dynamical friction of scs against disk field stars is so effective as to change the shapes of gcmfs within a relatively short time scale .",
    "our results also imply that if these less luminous early - type galaxies were formed from disk galaxies either by galaxy interactions or by major mergers , their gcmfs can be steeper owing to changes of gcmfs in _ their progenitor disks _ caused by dynamical friction .      since tremaine et al .",
    "( 1975 ) first investigated dynamical evolution of gcs interacting with background stars through dynamical friction in m31 to discuss nucleus formation in m31 , many authors discussed formation of stellar galactic nuclei via mergers of scs ( or gcs ) in galaxies with different physical properties ( e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "2001 ; capuzzo - dolcetta & vicari 2005 ) .",
    "recent fully self - consistent n - body simulations have shown that merging of scs in the inner regions of galaxies lead to the formation of stellar galactic nuclei with their projected radial density profiles similar to the observed ones ( e.g. , capuzzo - dolcetta & miocchi 2008 ) . although these works did not discuss potential importance of dissipative gas dynamics and star formation in the formation of stellar galactic nuclei ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2006 ; bekki 2007 ) , they significantly advanced our understanding dynamical evolution of multiple sc systems in galaxies .",
    "one of remaining questions in the sc merger scenario of nucleus formation is whether the scenario can explain the observed relation between stellar nucleus masses and their host galaxy ones ( @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the galaxy mass ; ct et al .",
    "2006 ) . since the observational study by ct et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derived total mass of the luminous components ( i.e. , not those for entire galaxies including the extended dark matter halos ) of galaxies by using reasonable @xmath71 , it is reasonable to use @xmath1 rather than @xmath72 for the purpose of discussing the observed @xmath73 relation .",
    "10 shows @xmath42 as a function of @xmath1 for the five models in which only @xmath1 are different between them .",
    "the simulated @xmath42 is close to the observed value of 0.003 for less luminous disk galaxies with @xmath74 .",
    "scs can lose a significant fraction of their original masses during their orbital evolution in galaxies ( e.g. , fujii et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is not considered at all in estimating @xmath42 in the present study .",
    "thus the simulated @xmath42 for less luminous disks can be regarded as fairly consistent with observations .",
    "10 also shows that formation of stellar galactic nuclei with @xmath75 by sc merging is not possible in more luminous disks owing to ineffective dynamical friction .",
    "therefore , the result implies that if the observed @xmath76 relation can be hold for all galaxies , the sc merger scenario may well have a serious problem in explaining the observation .",
    "however , galaxies are more likely to have massive black holes ( mbhs ) rather than stellar nuclei in more luminous galaxies with @xmath77 ( e.g. , ferrarese et al .",
    "2006 ) , though it is not so clear whether these galaxies with mbhs also have stellar nuclei ( i.e. , mbhs and stellar nuclei coexist in galaxies ) .",
    "thus it would be currently reasonable to claim that the sc merger scenario is a promising one for the formation of stellar galactic nuclei in galaxies .",
    "we have first shown that dynamical friction of scs against disk field stars can be so effective in low - mass disk galaxies so that orbital decay of scs can be as significant as to change physical properties ( e.g. , half - number radii and scmfs ) of their scss .",
    "previous theoretical and numerical works focused exclusively on dynamical friction of halo scs ( e.g. , old gcs ) against dark matter halos and showed that the time scale of orbital decay of scs due to dynamical friction against dark matter halos is relatively long ( a few to several gyr ) even for low - mass dwarfs like the fornax ( e.g. , goerdt et al .",
    "2006 for the cuspy nfw profile of its dark matter halo ) . since they did not investigate the influences of stellar disks on orbital evolution of halo scs through dynamical friction , it is worthwhile for the present study to investigate how halo scs evolve in disk galaxies if they can experience dynamical friction against both dark matter halos and against disk field stars .",
    "11 shows that orbital decay of halo scs due to dynamical friction against halos and disks is much less significant owing to ( i ) lower mass densities of the halos and ( ii ) larger velocity differences in the scs and dark matter halos for the standard model .",
    "the mean @xmath33 for the halo scs is 1.53 , which is by a factor of @xmath78 larger than that for the disk scs . only some more massive scs with @xmath79",
    "can show significant orbital decay ( i.e. , decreasing apocenter distances of their orbits ) for halo scs .",
    "this less effective dynamical friction in halo scs is a common feature in the present models , which suggests that the presence of disks in galaxies does not significantly change dynamical friction processes of halo scs .",
    "it should be however stressed that the halo scs initially in the inner region of the disk galaxy in the standard model shows a slightly flattened final spatial distribution : this can be due to relatively stong dynamical friction between halo scs and disk field stars in the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "we have investigated orbital evolution of scs being influenced by dynamical friction of disk field stars based on galaxy - scale numerical simulations on dynamical evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "we have investigated models with variously different model parameters in order to understand dependences of the effectiveness of dynamical friction of scs on physical properties of disk galaxies .",
    "we summarize our principle results as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) dynamical friction of scs against disk field stars is much more effective in orbital decay of scs in comparison with that against galactic halos in disk galaxies .",
    "for example , the half - number radius of the scs ( @xmath3 ) in a galaxy with @xmath80 can decrease by @xmath81% owing to orbital decay of scs caused by dynamical friction within well less than @xmath82 yr for a reasonable mf of scs .",
    "however orbital decay of scs due to dynamical friction can be more clearly seen only for more massive scs ( e.g. , those with @xmath83 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) dynamical friction processes of scs against disk field stars depend on physical properties of their host galaxies .",
    "for example , the dynamical friction is much more effective in disks with lower @xmath1 owing to smaller stellar velocity dispersions . as a result of this",
    ", @xmath3 can more rapidly evolve with time in disks with lower @xmath1 .",
    "evolution of scss in more massive disks ( with @xmath84 ) can not be clearly seen in the present study , which implies dynamical friction is important only for evolution of scss ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) in less massive disk galaxies .",
    "\\(3 ) dynamical friction of scs by disk field stars is more effective in disks with higher degrees of self - gravitating of the disks ( e.g. , higher @xmath50 ) , which implies that higher stellar densities and non - axisymmetric structures such as bars and spiral arms can promote dynamical friction .",
    "orbital decay of scs due to dynamical friction in disks does not depend so strongly on bulge masses of the disks for @xmath85 in the present study .",
    "evolution of scss due to orbital decay of scs caused by dynamical friction is more important in hsbs than in lsbs .",
    "\\(4 ) more massive scs can spiral - in to the nuclear regions ( @xmath86 ) of disk galaxies owing to dynamical friction so that they can form multiple sc systems there in less massive disk galaxies with @xmath87 .",
    "these systems show velocity dispersions comparable to or less than internal stellar velocity dispersions of scs so that they are likely to merge quickly with one another to form single massive scs there .",
    "thus formation of stellar galactic nuclei via merging of more massive scs is possible in less massive disk galaxies .",
    "\\(5 ) the observed @xmath88 relation ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) for less luminous galaxies can be closely associated with formation of stellar galactic nuclei by sc merging .",
    "the lf / mfs for more massive scs in scss of disk galaxies can steepen owing to the formation of stellar galactic nuclei through merging of more massive scs inwardly transferred to the nuclear region of galaxies .",
    "this steeping of sclf / mfs due to dynamical friction can be more significant in less massive galaxies .",
