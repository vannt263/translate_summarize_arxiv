    "while considerable insights have been gained regarding the formation of stars on small scales , the formation of rich stellar clusters dominated by ob stars is quite uncertain .",
    "debate has waged for decades over the relative importance of rapid ` top - down ' fragmentation or a slower ` bottom - up ' process involving merging of subcomponents @xcite . in the former model",
    ", cluster formation would occurring within @xmath2 core free - fall times , @xmath3  yr @xcite .",
    "rapid gravitational collapse is characteristic of clouds with weak turbulence on small scales @xcite . in the latter model ,",
    "cluster formation can be extended over millions of years , delayed by strong turbulence in the natal cloud .",
    "@xcite argue for slow cluster formation , in part on extensive evidence for strong turbulence in giant molecular clouds @xcite and in part on empirical evidence from hertzsprung - russell diagrams ( hrds ) of revealed clusters showing a wide age spread in the apparent ages of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars .    however , the interpretation of hrd age spreads is quite controversial for both observational and theoretical reasons , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite construct a model of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) where star formation accelerates slowly over millions of years in both the cluster core and outer regions . from a detailed analysis based on optical photometry and spectroscopy , @xcite report a characteristic age of 2.2  myr , and an intrinsic age spread of 2  myr , after accounting for various sources of age uncertainties .",
    "@xcite argue that the similar apparent age distribution of disk - bearing and disk - free stars in the onc implies that the cluster does not have a wide intrinsic age spread , but their result permit a spread of @xmath4  myr .",
    "a variety of observational difficulties can also cause artificial age spreads @xcite . and",
    "astrophysical calculations of stars decending the hayashi tracks for different histories of accretion show that an artificial age spread can appear for coeval clusters under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "a confusing element of this issue is that clusters often ( though not always ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show mass segregation where massive ob stars concentrate in the cluster cores .",
    "the ages of massive stars are difficult to estimate as they quickly arrive on the main sequence while the pms stars are on their hayashi tracks .",
    "there is some evidence that massive stars in cluster cores are younger than more dispersed pms stars in rich clusters (  [ prev_evidence.section ] ) .",
    "but it is not clear whether this reflects a general age gradient in cluster formation , or some special slow mode in the star formation process of massive stars , such as competitive accretion of core gas or stellar mergers @xcite .    in this context",
    ", we present a new empirical finding : that pms stars are younger in the core region than in the outer regions of two nearby rich clusters , the ngc  2024 ( flame nebula ) and orion nebula clusters in the orion molecular cloud complex .",
    "this result is independent of the ages of massive stars in the core .",
    "the work rests on two foundations .",
    "the first is a new sample of cluster members developed by the mystix ( massive young star - forming complex study in infrared and x - ray ) project for 20 star forming regions , including the flame and orion nebulae @xcite .",
    "the second is a new estimator of pms stellar ages called @xmath0 that is derived from x - ray and near - infrared photometric data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g14 ) .",
    "the spatial - age gradient we report here lies within the unified structure of a rich monolithic cluster on @xmath5  pc scales .",
    "getman et al .  report a separate result of spatial - age gradients across star forming regions on @xmath6  pc scales .",
    "we briefly review the methodology and samples from the mystix and @xmath0 studies (  [ methods.section ] ) , and present the results for the ngc  2024 and orion nebula clusters in  [ results_section ] .",
    "the implications for rich cluster formation are discussed in  [ discussion.section ] .",
    "the mystix project has produced rich stellar samples of 31,784 probable members of 20 ob - dominated young star forming regions at distances @xmath7  kpc using sensitive x - ray , near - infrared ( nir ) , and mid - infrared photometric catalogs @xcite .",
    "based on the mystix data , g14 developed a new pms stellar age estimator , @xmath0 .",
    "this estimator is based on @xmath8-band stellar photospheric emission and on x - ray emission from coronal magnetic flaring , and relies on an assumption of a nearly universal @xmath9 relationship for @xmath10  myr old pms stars (  3.1 in g14 ) relationships have been seen in a number of star forming regions with different ranges of characteristic ages , such as w  40 ( @xmath11  myr ) , taurus and onc ( @xmath2  myr ) , and ic  348 , ngc  2264 , and cep  ob3b ( @xmath12  myr ) . ] .",
    "stellar masses are directly derived from absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities calibrated to the @xmath13 relation from the taurus cloud pms population .",
    "these masses are combined with @xmath8-band magnitudes , corrected for source extinction ( using the nir color - color diagram ;  2.3 in g14 ) and distance , for comparison with pms evolutionary models @xcite to estimate ages .",
    "@xmath0 estimates are computed for over 5500 mystix pms stars in 20 star forming regions ( g14 ) .",
    "however , as for any other age method , @xmath0 estimates for individual stars are highly uncertain .",
    "the largest contribution to the error on @xmath0 is the scatter on the @xmath9 diagram that causes typical individual @xmath0 uncertainties of @xmath14  myr (  3.3 in g14 ) . to overcome the problem of uncertain individual ages and large spreads of age distributions for entire mystix regions , g14 compute median ages and their confidence intervals of stellar samples within individual mystix subclusters , which in turn were identified through the spatial clustering analysis by @xcite",
    "this approach allows to discriminate age differences and gradients among subclusters .",
    "the @xmath0 estimates for over a hundred mystix subclusters are referenced to a uniform time scale , which depends on the @xcite pms evolutionary models .",
    "since the @xmath0 method relies on evolutionary models , it does not provide `` absolute '' ages , as with most the standard pms age methods .    in this work",
    ", a similar approach is applied to the stars within the ngc 2024 and onc clusters . calculating median ages and their confidence intervals for different subregions of interest within these clusters , allowed the discovery of cluster core - halo age gradients (  [ age_gradient_section ] ) .",
    "we use subsamples of mystix pms stars with available @xmath0 estimates .",
    "the stars have been stratified by elliptical annular subregions within the clusters .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] ( panels a and d ) show these annuli with the inner and outer ellipses encompassing 1 and @xmath15 cluster core radii , respectively .",

    "the onc cluster core ellipses are calculated here using the spatial structure analysis methodology of @xcite .    for ngc  2024",
    ", the original @xmath0 sample of g14 is relatively small ( 103 stars ) , with only 4 stars in the cluster core .",
    "we therefore relax their conservative @xmath0 selection criterion on the reliability of nir data ( @xmath16  mag ) to add additional @xmath17 sources , all with their @xmath18 errors slightly above @xmath19  mag .",
    "this increases the number of @xmath0 sources in the cluster core to 9 stars and brings the total number of ngc  2024-@xmath0 stars to 121 .",
    "the ngc  2024 core cluster ellipse is centered at @xmath20 ( j2000 ) with core radius ( average of the major and minor axes ) @xmath21  pc , ellipticity @xmath22 , and position angle @xmath23 east of north @xcite .",

    "this reduces ` contamination ' by orion molecular cloud members , including deeply embedded protostars in the becklin - neugebauer / kleinman - low and omc-1s star formation regions @xcite .",

    "these methods were used in g14 , except the spline regression fits local parabolic rather than linear functions .",
    "the median spline fits in figure  [ fig1 ] ( panels b and e ) show monotonic increases in age within 1  pc from the centers to the halos of both clusters : from @xmath38  myr to @xmath39  myr in ngc  2024 , and from @xmath40  myr to @xmath14  myr in the onc .",
    "the large observed age spreads of individual stars about the median with the typical interquartile ranges @xmath41  myr and @xmath14  myr in ngc  2024 and onc , respectively , are a consequence of uncertainties of individual ages , possibly combined with real age spreads .",
    "but the median ages in the annuli ( figure  [ fig1 ] panels c and f ) are quite well - constrained . for ngc  2024 ,",
    "the stars in the cluster core ( @xmath42  pc ) are significantly younger with median age @xmath43  myr than the stars in the halo , @xmath44 and @xmath45  myr in the @xmath46  pc and @xmath47  pc annuli , respectively . for the onc ,",

    "these age gradients have very high statistical significance ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this gradient in stellar ages is associated with a gradient in interstellar absorption in the expected sense that younger pms stars are typically more heavily absorbed . in ngc  2024 ,",
    "source extinction monotonically decreases from the core ( median @xmath52  mag ) to the periphery ( median @xmath53  mag ) of the cluster colors [ and @xmath54 estimates ] are : @xmath55  mag [ @xmath56  mag ] ( red ellipse in figure  [ fig1 ] ) , @xmath57  mag [ @xmath58  mag ] ( green ) , @xmath59  mag [ @xmath60  mag ] ( blue ) , and @xmath61  mag [ @xmath62  mag ] ( orange ) . ] . for the onc , the stars within the core ( red ) and the 2 inner halo subregions ( green and blue ) are slightly more absorbed ( median @xmath63  mag ) than the stars within the outer halo ( orange and cyan ; median @xmath64  mag ) , but this may be due to gradients in the obscuring veil of material that lies in front of the onc .",
    "colors [ and @xmath54 estimates ] are : @xmath65  mag [ @xmath66  mag ] ( red ellipse in fig .",

    "lastly , we extend the onc age analysis to a larger stellar sample with higher extinctions up to @xmath74  mag , thereby increasing contamination from young stellar objects embedded in the omc cloud .",
    "the resulting median ages are younger than in the lightly obscured sample : from @xmath75  myr to @xmath76  myr in the green and blue elliptical annuli , and from @xmath77  myr to @xmath78  myr in the orange annulus .",
    "the median ages in the core ( red ellipse ) and in the most outward halo region ( cyan ) are unchanged at @xmath79  myr and @xmath80  myr , respectively .",
    "these two regions have the fewest contaminating omc objects .",
    "the mystix samples are mostly constructed as the union of carefully defined samples at three wavebands with some advanced statistical processing , applied uniformly to 20 massive star forming regions ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the constituent samples are from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , the _ spitzer space telescope _ , and 2mass and ukirt / ukidss nir surveys . however , various mystix data selection and incompleteness biases are present ( see appendix of feigelson et al . ) and could potentially affect our age gradient results .      ideally , it is desirable to perform analyses of cluster age gradients using spatial star samples with similar completeness limits in mass because : ( a ) the real age distribution of a stellar cluster could be astrophysically mass - dependent ; and ( b ) the location of data and evolutionary model isochrones on the hrd or a cmd diagram ( or the @xmath81 diagram in case of @xmath0 ) could be inconsistent with each other for different mass ranges",
    ". however , the following possible incompleteness and selection biases in the mystix data of ngc 2024 and onc might complicate the construction of uniform samples complete to some mass limit .",
    "first , we use subsamples of mystix pms stars with available @xmath0 estimates (  [ methods.section ] and g14 ) . for the @xmath0 analysis ,",
    "the full mystix pms samples were restricted to low - mass stars with available @xmath82 measurements with @xmath83  erg s@xmath84 ( @xmath85  m@xmath86 ) and reliable nir photometry , and were culled of protostellar objects with extremely large @xmath87-excesses for which there is no clear nir dereddening procedures ( g14 ) .",
    "second , the sensitivity to pms stars in the x - ray data has a spatial bias due to the decrease in the _ chandra _ telescope sensitivity with increasing off - axis angle , and due to the mystix bias against highly dispersed pms stars .",
    "third , the reduced sensitivity to onc members in the _ chandra_-acis image of orion within @xmath88 of @xmath89  ori  c due to the extended wings of its point spread function .    forth , the limiting sensitivity to faint x - ray sources in ngc 2024 due to the shorter exposure time of its _ chandra _ observation ( table 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "fifth , the reduced sensitivity to nir and x - ray ngc 2024 members in the central region due to the presence of an obscuring molecular core .",
    "sixth , the reduced sensitivity to faint nir stars due to the presence of high background nebular emission from heated dust around the cluster center .      for the analysis of age gradients in onc",
    ", the six potential incompleteness and selection biases described in  [ xlf_biases_subsubsection ] were easily overcome due to the exceptionally deep _",
    "chandra_-acis exposure of the orion region , nicknamed the @xmath90 orion ultradeep project ( coup ; * ? ? ?",
    "the `` coup unobscured '' stellar sample of 839 cool onc stars @xcite was found to be @xmath91% complete down to @xmath92  m@xmath86 ( neglecting effects of binarity ) .",
    "this is shown in figure 19 of @xcite that compares the initial mass function ( imf ) of the `` coup unobscured '' sample with the onc imf from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 onc subsample used in our age gradient analyses is identical to the `` coup unobscured '' stars with the constraint @xmath83  erg s@xmath84 applied .",
    "the first two potential sample bias problems are thus not present in the onc sample .",
    "the third problem is mitigated by the @xmath82 constraint that removes all faint x - ray sources from the sample .",
    "the fourth and fifth problems are not relevant to the onc , while the sixth potential problem was overcome by correlating x - ray sources with a deep nir image obtained with the vlt / isaac instrument on an 8-meter telescope @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that the observed mass function of the @xmath0 onc stellar sample is representative of the imf for @xmath91% of the intrinsic onc population within the mass range between @xmath93  m@xmath86 and @xmath79  m@xmath86 , if effects of binarity are ignored .",
    "using the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) as a surrogate for the imf @xcite , we investigate whether the x - ray luminosities have a spatial gradient that may have artificially produced an age gradient through the @xmath9 ( x - ray - mass ) relationship central to the @xmath0 estimation method ( g14 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_xlfs]c shows the cumulative xlfs for the core - halo strata in the onc .",
    "the strata have statistically indistinguishable xlfs , as confirmed with kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests .",
    "the ks test probabilities between the red and the remaining strata are @xmath94% ( green ) , @xmath95% ( blue ) , @xmath96% ( orange ) , and @xmath94% ( cyan ) .",
    "since the @xmath9 relation remains unvarying with time during the early evolutionary phase of pms stars ( g14 ) and the xlf is a surrogate for imf , the mass functions of the @xmath0 stellar subsamples within the different core - halo subregions are expected to be similar as well .      in the case of ngc  2024 , the mutual effect of the first ( @xmath97 sample selection ) , fourth ( moderate x - ray exposure ) , and especially the fifth ( high source extinction from the molecular core ) and sixth ( high background nir nebula emission ) biases (  [ xlf_biases_subsubsection ] ) is difficult to overcome , so the resulted @xmath0 stellar subsamples are more heterogeneous than in the onc .",
    "all spatial @xmath97 strata in ngc  2024 have statistically indistinguishable observed xlfs ( figure  [ fig_xlfs]a ) , as confirmed with ks tests% ( red ) , @xmath98% ( green ) , and @xmath99% ( blue ) .",
    "the ks test probabilities between the red and the remaining strata are @xmath100% ( green ) , @xmath101% ( blue ) , and @xmath102% ( orange ) . ] .",
    "however , as a result of the first and fourth potential biases , the three @xmath0 source subsamples for the ngc  2024 halo strata ( green , blue , orange ) are @xmath103% complete down to only @xmath104  erg / s ( @xmath105  m@xmath86 ) when compared to the xlf of the `` coup unobscured '' population .",
    "the problems are particularly acute in the cluster core where  due to the mutual effect of the first , forth , fifth , and sixth biases  the respective @xmath0 subsample is incomplete for any range of @xmath82 or mass .",
    "a handful of @xmath0 sources in the core of ngc  2024 thus might not be representative of the entire stellar population in the cluster core .",
    "we now provide additional lines of evidence for the extreme youth of the cluster core in ngc  2024 .      in the ngc  2024 cluster core , out of 114 mpcms @xcite ,",
    "95 have x - ray column density estimates @xmath106 , @xmath107 have disk classifications based on nir and @xmath108 photometry , @xmath109 have @xmath18 measurements ( not upper limits ) , but only 9 have passed our @xmath0 selection criteria (  [ methods.section ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , lines of independent evidence point towards the extreme youth of the cluster core .",
    "first , despite of the fact that the x - ray surveys tend to generate disk - free stellar samples @xcite , all these nine @xmath0 sources are disk - bearing objects with optically thick disks .",
    "seven of the nine have flat infrared spectral energy distributions , shown in figure [ fig_seds ] .",
    "moreover , the apparent infrared - excess disk fraction for the 34 mpcms with infrared - excess disk classification in the cluster core is extremely high , @xmath110% .",
    "recalling that @xmath0 estimation does not use any information on infrared excesses , the high apparent disk fraction and flat infrared spectral energy distributions of the ngc  2024 core objects independent supports a very young age for the core region .",
    "second , the ngc  2024 cluster core is closely associated with the molecular core seen on the @xmath111 image ( figure  [ fig1]a ) , suggesting that the cluster core is still embedded in its parental cloud .",
    "the median @xmath112 color for the @xmath109 mpcms with available @xmath18 measurements in the ngc  2024 core is very high , @xmath113  mag corresponding to @xmath52  mag .",
    "considering the integrated sample of 5525 mystix ysos across 15 mystix star forming regions , g14 give a spline regression line relating @xmath0 and the @xmath112 absorption indicator can serve as an approximate age predictor for the most highly reddened clusters estimates for these subclusters can be reasonably constrained . for instance , in figure  4 of g14 showing the relationship between the @xmath0 and @xmath112 , one can count over 70 ysos from 10 different star forming regions within the @xmath112 color range between 2.7 and 3.3 mag .",
    "the median @xmath0 values for these ysos is @xmath114  myr ( 68% confidence interval ) . ] . according to this regression relationship , the age of the ngc  2024 core would be @xmath115  myr .",
    "third , the median x - ray column density for 95 mpcms in the core with available @xmath106 estimates is remarkably high , @xmath116  @xmath117 corresponding @xmath118  mag .",
    "this gives an age @xmath38  myr from the spline regression relationship of g14 , similar to the @xmath93  myr value obtained above from the @xmath0 estimates directly (  [ age_gradient_section ] ) .",
    "these absorption measurements suggest that the entire mpcm sample in the core , not just the 9 stars with @xmath0 values , is extremely young .",
    "we finally note that since mystix and @xmath0 samples are incomplete for the very young class 0/i protostars ( feigelson et al . 2013 ; g14 ) , the true median age could be even younger than our @xmath0 estimates .      for the @xmath0 stellar sample within the entire ngc  2024 cluster , all but a few stars have available disk classifications from @xmath119 infrared spectral energy distributions @xcite .",
    "these classifications are listed in table  [ tbl_stars ] .",
    "figure [ fig_ks_vs_age]a plots the apparent disk fraction for the ngc  2024-@xmath0 stars as a function of median @xmath0 values in the elliptical annuli shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "in addition to the clear jump from 100% to @xmath120% disk fraction from the core to the halo% disk fraction estimate for the @xmath0 stellar sample within the cluster core is replaced by the @xmath121% disk fraction estimate for the mpcm spectral energy distribution sample within the cluster core (  [ ngc2024_core_section ] ) . ] , there is a hint of a decreasing disk fraction from 0.2  pc ( green point ) to @xmath41  pc ( orange point ) from the cluster center .",
    "this is consistent with the gradient in @xmath0 values .",
    "our estimates of the apparent disk fraction in ngc  2024 are roughly consistent with the estimate of @xcite averaged over the entire cluster .",
    "incidentally , we note that our apparent disk fraction of @xmath122% for the @xmath123  myr stars in the halo of ngc  2024 is similar to the disk fraction of @xmath124% ( @xmath125% ) for @xmath2  myr solar - mass ( low - mass ) stars in the nearby taurus star forming region @xcite .    for the mpcm onc catalog , @xcite employ the infrared spectral energy distribution disk classification results of @xcite",
    ". however , there is a lack of disk classifications for the large number of mystix stars in the central part of the orion region because of the extremely strong mid - infrared nebular background .",
    "therefore , here we use @xmath87-excess classification as a surrogate for disk fraction , understanding that this will result in systematically lower disk fractions than a classification using @xmath119 spectral energy distributions .",
    "a star is classified as a @xmath87-excess object if its position on the @xmath18 color - color diagram is to the right of the reddening line originating at @xmath126  m@xmath86 , assuming an age of @xmath127  myr and the reddening law given in g14 .",
    "all @xmath0 onc stars have available @xmath87-excess measurements from the deep @xmath128 survey reported by @xcite with results listed in table  [ tbl_stars ] here .",
    "figure  [ fig_ks_vs_age]b shows that the @xmath87-excess frequency in the onc core is significantly larger than that of the cluster periphery .",
    "our estimate of 50% disk fraction for the core agrees with the @xmath129% @xmath128 excess frequency for the full trapezium cluster derived by @xcite .",
    "incidentally , we note that the @xmath87-excess frequency of @xmath130% for the @xmath131  myr stars in the onc core is also consistent with the @xmath87-excess frequency of @xmath129% found for @xmath132  myr stars in the w  40 region @xcite , and our @xmath87-excess frequency of @xmath133% for the @xmath134  myr stars in the halo of onc is consistent with the @xmath87-excess frequency of @xmath135% found for @xmath136  myr stars in the ic  348 region @xcite .",
    "since optical ( as well as mid - infrared ) surveys suffer from the high background nebular emission in the central part of the onc , the optical age catalog of @xcite misses @xmath137% [ @xmath138% ] of the x - ray pms members in the cluster core area [ and the inner halo ; green ellipse in figure [ fig1 ] ] in the mass range @xmath139  m@xmath86 .",
    "@xcite find no correlations between optically derived isochronal ages and disk excess in the onc ; however , as their analysis is based on optical data , it has poor sensitivity towards the central part of the cluster where our current analysis detects significantly different ages and disk fractions .",
    "since the universal @xmath13 relationship is the essence of the @xmath0 method ( g14 ) , we check that the discovered age gradients are not biased by possible differences in xlfs between disk - bearing and disk - free stars .",
    "when the core - halo annular strata from figure [ fig1 ] are considered separately , we do not find any statistically significant differences between the xlfs in the disk - bearing and disk - free populations of ngc  2024 or the onc .",
    "for all individual annular strata , the ks test probabilities range between @xmath140% and @xmath141% .",
    "when the @xmath0 subsamples are combined over all annular strata within the _ chandra _ fields , we similarly find no differences between the xlfs in the onc stars with and without @xmath87-excess ( @xmath142% ; figure [ fig_xlfs]d ) , consistent with the previous findings that pms x - ray luminosities are not correlated with @xmath87 disk presence in the onc ( see figure 15 in * ? ? ?",
    "but in ngc  2024 , differences between xlfs of disk - bearing and disk - free stars may be present ( @xmath143% ; figure [ fig_xlfs]b ) .",
    "this may simply reflect an inhomogeneity in the ngc 2024 @xmath0 sample : due to the reduced 2mass point source sensitivity in the central part of the ngc 2024 cluster , the @xmath0 sample appears to be missing many x - ray - weaker sources embedded in the molecular core (  [ ngc2024_core_section ] ) .",

    "bright rimmed clouds : :    several cases have been found of small - scale sequential star formation    in pms stars on the periphery of rich clusters where the h region    shocks the ambient molecular material and produces ionized bright    rimmed clouds ( brcs ) . in these cases , the older stars lie closer to    the central ob - dominated cluster and the younger stars lie embedded in    the molecular cloud .",

    "* ) is found that pms    stars on the periphery of giant h regions are younger than the pms    stars in the central rich cluster .",
    "these spatial - age sequences are    attributed to star formation in the surrounding cloud triggered by the    expansion of the h region over millions of years , plausibly through    some combination of ` radiative driven implosion ' and ` collect and    collapse ' mechanisms .",
    "the results are age gradients opposite to those    discussed here with older stars at the cluster core and younger stars    at the cluster periphery .",
    "these findings relating to secondary    triggering processes do not provide insight into the formation process    of the original rich cluster that produced the giant h region .",
    "we establish that the median age of low mass pre - main sequence stars in cluster cores is younger than the median age of similar stars in cluster peripheries in the two richest star clusters of the orion molecular cloud .",
    "our results give no information in any direction on the sequence of events giving rise to ob star formation or mass segregation .",
    "we also do not provide clear results on the age spread , either globally or in spatially confined regions .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig1 ] ( panels b and e ) suggests that a possible cause of the gradients in median may be mostly due to the absence of older stars , not an excess of younger stars , in these clusters .",
    "the simplest model for the spatial - age gradient we see in the ngc  2024 and orion nebulae clusters is that stars form first in the periphery of the progenitor molecular core and later in the center . but",
    "this is astrophysically counterintuitive .",
    "the classical scenario for unified cluster formation predicts that the highest density core at the center of a cloud concentration collapses first , while star formation in the cluster outskirts occurs at different times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that the star - formation rate decelerates faster in regions of higher density as gas is quickly exhausted on the shorter free - fall timescale , implying that the dense centers of molecular clouds should form most of their stars early in the cluster formation process .",
    "@xcite argues that a star - formation front moving from the inside to the outside of a cloud can produce a relationship between cluster mass and radius that she observes in a sample of rich clusters .",
    "these scenarios would suggest a radial age gradient opposite from what is observed in our work : the cluster centers would have the oldest stars , not the youngest stars as we find here .",
    "the properties of the natal molecular cloud must be taken into consideration when determining what scenarios are plausible explanations for our effect .",
    "clouds in massive star forming regions ( msfrs ) have large scale density gradients , are turbulent @xcite with dense , gravitationally unstable filaments @xcite .",
    "gas probably flows perpendicularly onto the filaments from the larger cloud , and longitudinally along the filaments onto star - forming clumps @xcite .",
    "gas is later expelled by feedback effects of young stars including protostellar outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ob radiation and winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and supernovae @xcite .",
    "star inflow , as well as gas inflow , may be important . in a model",
    "where star formation is distributed throughout the molecular cloud in local turbulent concentrations of gas , these stars are gravitationally pulled inward to form the cluster core through violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "models of cluster formation do not necessarily require delayed star formation in the core to produce the spatial - age gradient in lower mass stars reported here . instead , older stars could be removed from the core or star formation could continue in the core after it has terminated in the outer regions . recall that we only report that the median age in the cluster cores is lower than in the cluster halos",
    "; we do not establish the full distribution of ages in either location , and these distributions need not have similar shapes .",
    "logically , there are three possible causes for the age gradient that is observed in the current work : ( 1 ) star - formation occurred more recently in the inner cluster region than the outer region ; ( 2 ) older stars move outward ; or ( 3 ) younger stars move inward .",
    "any combination of these three processes would also produce an age gradient .",
    "below we review star - formation theory that might lead to these phenomena .",
    "three of these scenarios are illustrated by the cartoons in figure [ cartoon.fig ] .",
    "the panels  relating to scenarios a , f , and g  differ in their assumptions of the global structure of the molecular cloud , filamentary cloud substructure , and infalling cloud clumps .",
    "a. although gas accretion onto stars will deplete the cloud material in both regions , gas is less dense in the periphery .",
    "there is likely a threshold below which gas is no longer unstable to gravitational collapse .",
    "@xcite find that this threshold is roughly a column density of @xmath161  @xmath117 , corresponding to @xmath162  mag extinction , in dense filaments that pervade many msfrs . with decreasing gas surface density throughout the cloud",
    ", the less dense peripheral cloud material will drop below this threshold first and stop forming stars before the cloud center stops .",
    "viewed later as a mystix star forming region , the outer stars will appear older on average than the central stars .",
    "b. @xcite and @xcite argue that over millions of years the combination of global gravitational contraction and star formation threshold results in acceleration of the star formation rate .",
    "thus , most of the stars in the core would have formed at the end of the cloud lifetime and would appear younger than stars in the cluster periphery .",
    "c. many theoretical models of massive star formation predict that o stars form at the center of clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a few clusters observational evidence indicates that o stars may be the last stars in a cluster to form @xcite , perhaps because the timescale needed for competitive accretion or mergers to make massive stars is longer .",
    "this would imply , that  at least for massive stars  there would be age stratification .",
    "d. if stars are forming from a molecular core that is not gravitationally bound , then the resulting cluster may be supervirial and its stars will drift away from the cloud after they are born due to their initial velocities .",
    "this may be common for low - mass cloudlets in regions like the south pillars of carina @xcite .",
    "unbound stars could also be produced by three - body interactions ; for example , star - cluster formation simulations by @xcite shows ejection of some first - generation stars .",
    "older stars will have a longer time to drift , so they will be located farther from the cluster center .",
    "after some first - generation of stars has drifted away , infall of cloud material can lead to a new population of young stars being born at the cluster center .",
    "e. there is growing evidence to suggest that stars are born with subvirial velocity dispersions .",
    "in hydrodynamical models , @xcite find that initial stellar velocities are subvirial even when the simulated gas cloud start unbound .",
    "models of subvirial clusters match radial velocity observations of the orion star - forming region @xcite . in this case",
    ", stars would tend to get dynamically heated with cluster relaxation .",
    "since older stars would have more time to experience dynamical effects , they would preferentially be located at larger radii than younger , dynamically cooler stars .",
    "f. several phenomena can cause young cluster expansion .",
    "most important is the loss of the gravitational potential of the molecular material which dominates the early phases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar dynamics can cause expansion through three - body interactions with hard binaries and gravothermal core collapse associated with mass segregation @xcite .",
    "msfrs often have multiple subclusters of young stars related to the clumpy structure of the natal molecular cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the first - born subclusters may have already expanded while the later - born subclusters are still highly centrally concentrated .",
    "the expanded older subclusters may resemble a low surface - density halo of stars , while the younger , centrally concentrated subclusters may form the core of the resulting cluster .",
    "g. some simulations of cluster formation show star - forming filaments of gas falling into the gravitational potential minimum at the center of a msfr , bringing along many of the young stars that formed in the filaments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these filaments of stars and gas are more massive than unembedded stars making up a star cluster at the center of a star - forming region , so they will sink to the center due to dynamical segregation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if stars in these star - forming filaments are younger than the rest of the cluster , this can lead to the observed age stratification .",
    "h. if subclusters expand as they age , younger subclusters are likely to be smaller and denser @xcite",
    ". simulations of subcluster mergers indicate that the resulting cluster may generate a core - halo structure @xcite , which may include stellar age stratification .",
    "if an older low - density subcluster merges with a younger high - density subcluster , the older stars will likely become more widely distributed .",
    "the findings here involving two clusters in the nearby orion molecular cloud complex , combined with past studies of w  3 main and iras 19343 + 2026 , could have important general implications for the formation processes of clustered star formation .",
    "but further research to establish spatial - age gradients in a larger cluster sample and astrophysical modeling to discriminate between the models above ( or other explanations ) is highly desirable .",
    "we see a clear path towards observational elucidation of intra - cluster spatial - age gradients in rich clusters .",
    "obtaining deeper @xmath90 and/or near - infrared imagery for mystix and similar cluster targets is an important ingredient .",
    "the orion nebula region has already been the subject of a very long observation ( coup ; * ? ? ?",
    "improved nir ( currently only 2mass ) and x - ray ( currently 80  ks long ) exposures of ngc  2024 would increase the stellar sample with stars in the @xmath163  m@xmath151 range by a factor of two or more . deeper exposures for carefully selected clusters beyond the orion molecular cloud would give sufficiently rich stellar samples to allow detection of spatial - age gradients , if present .",
    "for many nearby star forming regions , existing @xmath128 and mid - infrared samples are already sufficiently deep for finding counterparts to the fainter x - ray sources .",
    "hydrodynamical and n - body simulations of different modes of cluster formation and early evolution , such as those illustrated in figure  [ cartoon.fig ] , could elucidate the origins of our spatial - age segregation .",
    "several research groups are developing relevant models including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mystix project not only provides positions and mass estimates of individual cluster members , but also measures of the total stellar population , central star density , and other parameters relevant to astrophysical modeling ( kuhn et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "theoretical studies might not only constrain the modes of cluster formation , but also the epoch of gas expulsion that is crucial for the dynamical expansion and dissipation of clusters .",
    "it has not been clearly known whether stellar cluster formation occurs within 1-few core free - fall times or over millions of years .",
    "the view of the slow mode of cluster formation is supported in part by empirical evidence of wide age spreads within rich stellar clusters .",
    "however , it has been unclear whether these age spreads are due to poor individual age estimates or to real extended star formation histories (  [ intro_section ] ) .    in this work , we analyze age distributions of two nearby rich stellar clusters , the ngc 2024 ( flame nebula ) and orion nebula clusters in the orion molecular cloud complex .",
    "our analysis is based on a new estimator of pms stellar ages , @xmath0 , that is derived from x - ray and near - infrared photometric data ( g14 ) . to overcome the problem of uncertain individual ages ,",
    "we compute median ages and their confidence intervals of stellar samples within annular subregions of the clusters .",
    "we find core - halo age gradients in both the ngc 2024 and orion nebula clusters : low - mass pms stars in cluster cores appear younger , and thus formed later , than low - mass pms stars in cluster peripheries (  [ age_gradient_section ] ) .",
    "various selection effects were investigated (  [ xlf_section ] ) . in the onc they turned out to be unimportant , but not in ngc 2024 .",
    "other considerations helped suggesting that these should not be a major bias in the result (  [ ngc2024_core_section ] ) .",
    "these findings are further supported by the independent discovery of the spatial gradients in the mid - infrared and near - infrared disk fractions (  [ disk_fraction_section ] ) .",
    "based purely on pms stellar data in a narrow mass range , our results give no information on the sequence of events that give rise to ob star formation and mass segregation .",
    "_ an essential implication of our findings is that clusters do have true age spreads . _",
    "if clusters truly formed exceedingly rapidly , then our median @xmath0 estimates would be consistent with a single cluster age value .",
    "the ages shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ( panels c and f ) invalidate rapid cluster formation for ngc  2024 and the onc .",
    "we provide several theoretical star formation scenarios that alone , or in combination with each other , may lead to the observed core - halo age gradients (  [ scenarios_section ] ) . these include : exhaustion of gas in the periphery of a cloud , acceleration of star formation in the cloud core , late formation of massive stars with low - mass stellar siblings , kinematic outward drift of older stars , stellar dynamical heating with cluster relaxation , expansion of subclusters , infalling filaments nursing newly born stars , and subcluster mergers .",
