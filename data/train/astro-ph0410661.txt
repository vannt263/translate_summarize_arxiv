    "brane - world scenarios , after their discovering some years ago  ( @xcite ) quickly became very popular .",
    "there are numerous issues in the field of branes and one of the most actual is brane - world inflation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider brane - world randall - sundrum type ii ( rsii )  @xcite scenario with power - law potential of the scalar field and study the possibility for successful inflation in such model .",
    "our current method is similar to method we used when studied inflation in closed friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) models  @xcite .",
    "namely we calculate the total number of e - folds during inflation , the value of potential at the end of inflation and the amplitude and spectral index of scalar perturbations at the epoch when present hubble scale leaves the horizon",
    ". then we check if the total number of e - folds is larger than 72 and if it does we say the initial data for this model lead to inflation",
    ". this value must be larger than the number of e - folds between the moment when present hubble scale crosses the horizon during inflation and the moment of the end of inflation .",
    "this second value is model - dependent and it depends on some features of theory , such as the way of inflation ends etc .",
    "it varies from theory to theory in a range from 55 to 75 approximately and using @xmath0 we use in some sense mean value for it .",
    "our study shows that constraints one can set are slightly dependent on this value if it changes in the range from 55 to 75 .",
    "the second test is linked with the value of potential at the end of inflation .",
    "we calculate it and compare with observation data  @xcite @xmath1 for brane case the situation with the energy density at the end of inflation may be more complicated then in the frw case ( see  @xcite for details ) .    also we can calculate index of the scalar perturbations spectrum at the epoch when present hubble scale leaves the horizon during inflation . since there are observation constraints on scalar spectral index from wmap  @xcite , acbar  @xcite , cbi  @xcite and other cmb experimens  @xcite and large - scale structure  @xcite : @xmath2    @xmath3    ( wmap+acbar+cbi+2dfgrs+@xmath4-forest ) we can compare our predictions with these data and set some constraints on our model .    finally we calculate the amplitude of scalar perturbations at the epoch when present hubble scale leaves the horizon and compare it with cobe constraint  @xcite @xmath5    these three small tests help us in setting some constraints on the parameters of our model and on parameters of the potential .",
    "but in fact we do not focus on one of parameters   _ dark radiation _ , because it actes only in the beginning of the inflation , so in this sence it behaves itself something like curvature .",
    "the influence of the initial curvature on the total number of e - folds and background values for frw case was studied in  @xcite and we found that this influence is very weak .",
    "one can suspect this influence is weak in brane inflation as well .. but the dark radiation , unlike curvature , is one of the parameters which determine the initial value of the total energy density , so it must act some differently .    the structure of the paper as follows .",
    "first , we write down the main equations we used in our work and describe our method .",
    "then , in section iii we describe the situation with quadratic potential , constraints on the parameters for this potential , in section iv   the same but for quartic potential , and linear potential is considered in section v. finally in section vi we discuss our results .",
    "the main equations , which determine the evolution of our model , are  @xcite    @xmath6    @xmath7    and the first integral of our system is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is 4d planck mass and @xmath10 is 5d planck mass .",
    "below we use only @xmath9 so we need to write down the relation between these two masses :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is brane tension .    since our aim is studing inflation and we are interesting in determination of the moment when inflation ends , let us rewrite eq.(5 ) in terms of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , and @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 using eq.(8 ) :    @xmath14    or using normalization @xmath15 :    @xmath16    now we study brane inflation with power - law potential of the scalar field .",
    "such potentials are well - known and well - studied in standard frw cosmology  @xcite and in brane models as well  @xcite and they lead to chaotic inflation  @xcite . for power - law potentials we use following representation :    @xmath17",
    "as we noted above we use scalar spectral tilt as one of our tests .",
    "the most common view for it is  @xcite @xmath18,\\ ] ]    and using our normalization and eq.(9 ) we can rewrite it as @xmath19    one more value which we use to set our constraints is the amplitude of scalar perturbations at the moment when present hubble scale left the horizon during inflation .",
    "this value is given by  @xcite @xmath20 ^ 3.\\ ] ]    we can rewrite it using eq.(9 ) and our normalization @xmath15 : @xmath21 ^ 3.\\ ] ]    and finally about our method . like in our previous papers about inflation  @xcite , we start from planck boundary and than integrate equations ( 5**),(6 ) through inflation .",
    "also we check constraint eq.(7 ) to do not diverge . like in  @xcite",
    "we start not from 4d but from 5d planck boundary .",
    "so from left - hand side of eq.(7 ) one can see :    @xmath22    and one can parametrize initial @xmath23 and @xmath24 by next way :    @xmath25    the value @xmath26 completely parametrizes initial @xmath23 and @xmath24 . from right - hand side of eq.(7 ) one can see that there are three extra parameters : @xmath12   brane tension , @xmath27   dark radiation and last parameter is @xmath28   the ratio of kinetic energy of the scalar field to the total energy density of the scalar field .",
    "last value allows us to calculate initial values for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "so finally we have five parameters : @xmath26 , which describes initial curvature ; @xmath28 , which describes a contribution of the kinetic energy to the total energy density of the scalar field .",
    "these two parameters describe initial conditions , last three are parameters of the model : brane tension @xmath12 , parameter from the potential @xmath31 and dark radiation @xmath27 .",
    "requirement that model should to be consistent with newton s law at small distances sets constraint on @xmath12  @xcite :    @xmath32    also from right - hand side of eq.(7 ) one can set constraint on initial value of @xmath27 :    @xmath33    ( in order to energy density of dark radiation do not exceed 5d planck boundary ) . and let us note   due to pure geometrical nature of this dark energy term its energy density need not to be positive . and as we can see from eq.(11 ) value of @xmath27 is bounded upper but unbounded below .",
    "in this section we present our results for case of quadratic potential .",
    "they are presented in fig . 1 .    in fig .",
    "1(a ) we present only a region with @xmath34 ( grey area ) .",
    "in fact most of trajectories ( as a _ trajectory _",
    "we mean an evolution curve for a model with particulair initial conditions in some coordinates , say @xmath35 _ etc .",
    "_ ) with initially large enough @xmath36-term show oscillationary behavior ( this is due to so - called duality between low - energy friedmann regime and high - energy brane @xmath36-regime  @xcite ) , so as the total number of e - folds we mean the maximal number of e - folds before first @xmath37 violation .    in fig",
    "1(b ) we present only a region with parameters which lead to values of the potential at the end of inflation which obey eq.(1 ) ( grey region ) . in fig .",
    "1(c ) models with @xmath38 and @xmath12 leading to @xmath39 are shown .",
    "one can see from eq.(9 ) that always @xmath40 .",
    "in fact one can choose as a boundary value for @xmath41 not 0.95 but say 0.94 ( see eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) , but these two values are practically indistinguishible and they both lead to practically similair constraints on @xmath38 and @xmath12 , so we use single value @xmath42 . in fig .",
    "1(d ) we represent all constraints from ( a ) to ( c ) together with last constraint linked with eq.(2 ) .",
    "parameters from grey area in @xmath43-parameter space in fig .",
    "1(c ) obey requirements from all ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c )   their total number of e - folds is larger than 72 , the value of the potential and the end of inflation lies in a range of eq.(1 ) and @xmath44 .",
    "bold black line in fig .",
    "1(d ) corresponds to parameters with amplitude of the spectrum of scalar perturbations at the epoch when the present hubble scale left the horizon obeys eq.(2 ) .",
    "let us remind the reader we choose this value as 62 , i.e. the present hubble scale left the horizon 62 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "in fact one may choose another value , say , in  @xcite we used two different values   62 and 55 and we found that there is no significant difference between these two cases , see  @xcite for details .    finally , from fig .",
    "1(c ) one can set constraints on both @xmath38 and @xmath12 or on one of them with fixed another one .",
    "values for @xmath12 obey eq.(10 ) . from intersection of curve @xmath45 with grey area",
    "one can set constraint on @xmath31 : @xmath46 . and",
    "constraint on @xmath12 is : @xmath47 .",
    "this section is devoted to the quartic potential and our results are presented in fig .",
    "2 . one can see that some global changes occur from the @xmath48 case .",
    "say , the requirement @xmath34 leads to simple requirement @xmath49 in @xmath50 case ( see fig.2(a ) ) , and in @xmath48 case it leads to some more complicated constraint dependent on both @xmath31 and @xmath12 ( see fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "area , which one can get from eq.(2 ) , is shown in fig .",
    "it differs from fig .",
    "1(b ) in another scope in @xmath51 coordinates .",
    "all these changes are due to differ in powers of the power - law potential in cases @xmath48 ( fig . 1 ) and @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in fig .",
    "2(c ) we represent constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath12 from eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "it remains practically unchanged from @xmath48 case . and finally in fig .",
    "2(d ) we summarized all constraints from figs .",
    "2(a ) to 2(c ) and add a curve which corresponds to eq.(4 ) .",
    "so from fig .",
    "2(d ) we can set following constraints on the parameters of our model : @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "finally we consider linear potential and our results are presented in fig .",
    "3 . analogically with two previous cases in fig .",
    "3(a ) we represent on the parameter space values of parameters which lead to inflation with total number of e - folds more than 72 , in fig .",
    "3(b ) those who obey eq.(1 ) , in fig .",
    "3(c )   those who obey @xmath54 and in fig .",
    "3(d ) we summarized three previous constraints and add a curve which corresponds to eq.(4 ) .",
    "so from fig .",
    "3(d ) one can set constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath12 : @xmath55 ; @xmath56 .",
    "we have investigated three cases for brane inflation with power - law potential of the scalar field .",
    "namely we considered linear , quadratic and quartic potentials and found constraints on the parameters for these three particulair cases .",
    "constraints on the parameters for these three models are summarized in table 1 . and now let us generalize our results .",
    ".[tab : table1]in this table we summarized our constraints on brane inflation models with power - law potentials for three different powers .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from comparing figs . 1 , 2 and 3",
    "we can learn that for all three cases we have similair slope of the curve @xmath41 .",
    "slopes of lines @xmath57 and lines correspondent to eq.(1 ) are different due to different powers .",
    "but the best behavior ( from the model s testability point of view ) shows constraint from eq.(4 ) .",
    "namely increasing of the power leads to decreasing of the maximal value of @xmath31 which corresponds to increasing power .",
    "this means for @xmath58 we always have an area from intersection of @xmath59 , @xmath41 and @xmath60 constraints and this area always is intersected by @xmath61 line . the only constraint on maximal value of the power one can set from the fact that the maximal value of @xmath31 need obey eq.(10 ) .",
    "let us note that one can also set some constraints on this model but from other point of view .",
    "say , in  @xcite some constraints made from some other background .",
    "but apart from our results they found that even quartic potential is under strong pressure from observation . let us also note that in friedmann case our  @xcite results and results from  @xcite are similair   both of them lead to @xmath62 constraint .    and last our example is linear potential .",
    "this is very uncommon potential for inflation , but for brane inflation case it works ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "but for case @xmath63 there simple may occur that there will be no intersection between final area of @xmath59 , @xmath41 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 curve : @xmath61 curve seems to move to high values of @xmath31 with decreasing of power and at some low enough power it can lie at @xmath31 s that higher than any @xmath31 of the area of final constraints from @xmath59 , @xmath41 and @xmath60 .",
