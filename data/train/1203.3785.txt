    "stochastic methods for physical systems coupled to external baths have a long history dating back to einstein @xcite and langevin @xcite .",
    "the idea behind these approaches is that the many degrees of freedom of the bath induce random motion in the system @xcite .",
    "classically , this is due to collisions between the particles of the bath and of the system and can be described by a langevin equation for certain system variables .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the randomness is introduced by transitions between different states of the system induced by the bath and can be described by a stochastic schrdinger equation ( sse ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can derive statistical descriptions averaging over many realisations of the stochastic process , leading to the fokker - planck equation for the distribution function of a classical system and the master equation for the reduced density operator of a quantum system @xcite , respectively . assuming the equivalence between the master equation for the density matrix @xmath0 and the sse @xcite , which might not always hold @xcite , the latter has sometimes been seen as a `` quick and dirty '' way to obtain the solution of the former .",
    "the numerical solution of the master equation scales poorly with the number of states kept in the calculation since it is an equation of motion for a _ matrix _ in state space , whereas a schrdinger equation is an equation for a _",
    "vector_. this strongly limits the applicability of the master equation to complex systems .",
    "in particular if the quantum system consists of interacting particles , in which case the state space is the fock space , the scaling of the density matrix strongly limits the numerical calculations and approximate methods are needed @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can establish a time - dependent density functional theory @xcite of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in general , the dynamics of an open system is non - markovian , i.e. , the change of the state of the system at a certain time does not only depend on its present state but also on its state at all previous times . understandably , the solution of a non - markovian master equation @xcite is difficult because it involves the evaluation of a convolution integral which depends on the history of the system .",
    "therefore , one often employs a markov approximation , which replaces the memory kernel in this convolution integral by a @xmath1-function . in doing so , however , one looses the connection with the exact dynamics and the ability to reproduce the correct steady state , unless one is capable of constructing effective bath - system operators that recover the exact behaviour @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that an exact time - convolutionless master equation can be derived @xcite .",
    "however , this does not usually reduce the numerical complexity since one needs to evaluate the generator of the time - convolutionless master equation describing the history of the system at each time step of the numerical integration .    in order to study the non - markovian dynamics",
    "it would be advantageous to have a sse that is local in time but is nevertheless able to reproduce the dynamics induced by a non - markovian master equation ( nmme ) .",
    "such an equation has been proposed by strunz and coworkers : first mentioned as a byproduct in @xcite , it has been applied to the spin - boson model and compared to non - linear sses in @xcite and also to a more realistic two - level model immersed in a photonic band - gap material in @xcite . here , we arrive at the same tclsse of strunz and coworkers starting from a non - markovian sse obtained by gaspard and nagaoka @xcite .",
    "we show how the tclsse and the nmme coincide up to third order in the coupling parameter between the system and the bath .",
    "one of the applications of the formalism is the investigation of the bath - induced relaxation of the open system towards a steady state . in contact with a single bath at a constant temperature",
    ", the system will approach an equilibrium state with that temperature .",
    "it can be shown that in the non - markovian case there exists an exact condition that the memory kernel must satisfy for the system to reach thermal equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "( it is well known that the hamiltonian @xmath3 appearing here might be different from the one describing the system dynamics , due for example to the stark and lamb shifts . for simplicity ,",
    "we here assume that these effects can be neglected , since they are normally proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the coupling parameter between the system and the bath . )",
    "this condition is known as _ detailed balance _ since it relates the absorption and emission probabilities .",
    "the detailed - balance condition is usually no longer satisfied if the markov approximation is made @xcite .",
    "hence , the history dependence of the equation of motion is an essential ingredient for thermal relaxation .",
    "this begs the questions of whether a tclsse is also able to describe thermal relaxation dynamics correctly . to answer this question ,",
    "we study the relaxation of a three - level system employing the tclsse and compare its dynamics to the one obtained from the nmme .",
    "the next natural step is to test the formalism for a case with two baths at different temperatures , which leads to energy transport .",
    "hence , we also address the questions on how to apply the tclsse to study energy transport in spin chains .",
    "the numerical solution of the tclsse requires the generation of complex coloured noise , essential to mimic the correlation functions of the non - markovian baths @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a portable and fast algorithm to generate any coloured noise whose power spectrum is a positive function .",
    "the algorithm relies on the ability of performing a fast fourier transform and is therefore easily optimised .",
    "other algorithms have been presented in the past to solve this problem or at least the one of generating real coloured noise @xcite . in section [ noisegeneration ]",
    ", we compare our algorithm to some of them and show that it performs better than these routines while having a broader range of applicability .",
    "our starting point is a standard second - order nmme @xcite . the coupling between the system and the bath is taken to be bilinear , @xmath6 in the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the system and the bath , respectively .",
    "if any operator of the system commutes or anticommutes with any operator of the bath , one can always expand any coupling operator in this form .    in the following we assume that the bath and the system do not exchange _ fermions _ , i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 commute with each other .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to the case that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are hermitian operators ; the extension to the more general case where only @xmath9 is hermitian is straightforward . under the assumptions of weak system - bath interaction , factorisation of the full density operator at the initial time @xmath10 and vanishing averages of bath operators to first order",
    ", the equation of motion for the reduced density operator @xmath11 of the system is given by @xcite @xmath12    + \\lambda ^2   \\sum_{a}\\ , [ \\hat s_a , \\hat m^{\\dagger}_a ( t)-\\hat m_a ( t ) ] , \\label{nmme}\\ ] ] up to second order in the coupling parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we have set @xmath13 and defined @xmath14 in this nmme , @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of the system and the correlation kernel is given by @xmath15 , \\label{cbb}\\ ] ] where the trace is over the bath degrees of freedom , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the hamiltonian of the bath . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the statistical operator of the bath .",
    "if @xmath18 describes a single bath in thermal equilibrium , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the inverse temperature , the system should relax towards thermal equilibrium , @xmath21 , with the same temperature as the bath .",
    "the property that the steady state is the thermal equilibrium must be encoded in the correlation kernel @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , one can show that the system relaxes towards thermal equilibrium if @xmath23 and the power spectrum @xmath24 satisfies the detailed - balance condition @xcite @xmath25 gaspard and nagaoka @xcite have shown that the dynamics introduced by the nmme can be obtained not only by a numerical integration of ( [ nmme ] ) but also by the solution of a sse for a state @xmath26 , @xmath27 in this non - markovian sse ( nmsse ) , the complex noises @xmath28 have the properties @xmath29 and one can obtain the dynamics of the open quantum system by taking the average over realisations of the stochastic process , indicated by the overline .",
    "in particular , the reduced density operator is obtained as @xmath30 . however , any attempt to solve the nmsse ( [ non - markovian ] ) requires a large numerical effort due to the time integral , which needs to be evaluated at every time step and for every realisation .",
    "this begs the question of whether there exists a simpler sse that reproduces on average the dynamics induced by the nmme .",
    "this is the case , as strunz and yu have shown @xcite .    indeed , the tclsse @xmath31 with @xmath32 reproduces on average the dynamics induced by the nmme ( [ nmme ] ) up to third order in @xmath5 @xcite . to prove this , we write ( [ non - markovian2 ] ) in the interaction picture , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and expand the time - evolution operator up to second order in @xmath5 , @xmath35    |\\psi_i(0)\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\mathcal{o}(\\lambda^3).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expansion",
    "is inserted into the expression for the reduced density operator @xmath36 . by performing the average , using the properties given in ( [ color_noise ] ) and the identity @xmath37 , and differentiating with respect to @xmath38 , we arrive at @xmath39 + \\mathcal{o}(\\lambda^4 ) .",
    "\\label{derivation_step}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the averages of the terms in @xmath40 vanish .",
    "furthermore , replacing @xmath41 by @xmath42 does not change the equation up to terms of order @xmath40 .",
    "finally , by returning to the schrdinger picture we arrive at the nmme ( [ nmme ] ) up to terms of order @xmath40 , i.e. , higher than the order up to which these equations are valid anyway .",
    "indeed , the nmme and the sse are usually derived as a second - order expansion in the coupling parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this is remarkable since one might expect a more complex time - non - local sse to be required for reproducing the dynamics of the nmme ( [ nmme ] ) .",
    "still , the tclsse is local in time , i.e. , the operator @xmath43 does not depend on the state of the system at previous times and can thus be calculated once before the numerical integration and be used for each realisation of the stochastic process . hence , the numerical cost of solving each realisation of the tclsse is comparable to that of a markovian sse @xcite .",
    "we note that at the same level of approximation , @xmath40 , we can derive a time - convolutionless master equation instead of the non - local ( [ nmme ] ) .",
    "indeed , in ( [ derivation_step ] ) we could replace @xmath41 by @xmath44 , arriving at @xmath45 + \\mathcal{o}(\\lambda^4 ) .",
    "\\label{tclme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , since in general we expect the density matrix and the operators @xmath46 not to commute , the integral over @xmath47 still contains the density matrix in a complicated manner . from a numerical point of view",
    ", the solution of this equation is therefore not simpler than that of ( [ nmme ] ) .",
    "the equivalence of ( [ nmme ] ) and ( [ tclme ] ) is a generalization of the result that a time - convolutionless pauli master equation , i.e. , a master equation for the diagonal components of the density matrix only , can be proven to be equivalent to a nakajima - zwanzig - markov pauli master equation to second order in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the tclsse ( [ non - markovian2 ] ) can also be seen as an intermediate step towards the derivation of a markovian sse following for example the technique proposed by gaspard and nagaoka @xcite . in section",
    "[ examples ] , we will show how to use the tclsse to evaluate the dynamics of some simple system and compare it to the time evolution described by the nmme .",
    "the tclsse requires the generation of coloured noise and thus the method will only be practicable if an efficient algorithm for the generation of this noise is available .",
    "such an algorithm indeed exists , as we show below , where we extend an algorithm presented by rice @xcite to the complex noise required here .",
    "we consider only a single bath operator ; the generalisation to several bath operators is straightforward .",
    "some of the existing algorithms for the generation of coloured noise rely on the numerical solution of a stochastic differential equation that has to produce noise with the given target correlation function @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "however , such an equation is a piece of information that is rarely available , since even the analytic expression for @xmath48 may not be known . except for a few simple models ,",
    "it is more common to have access to the power spectrum @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , @xmath50 is connected to the quantum transitions in the bath .",
    "on the other hand , the algorithm presented in @xcite does not require the knowledge of a stochastic differential equation .",
    "however , besides the power spectrum @xmath50 is does require the inverse fourier transform of its square root .",
    "this quantity is then convoluted with a white noise to generate the target real coloured noise .",
    "we will introduce an algorithm that directly uses @xmath51 as input , thereby reducing the numerical cost compared to the algorithm of @xcite and that generates a complex coloured noise with the properties given in ( [ color_noise ] ) .",
    "indeed , one can easily prove that the noise @xmath52 can be generated by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a white - noise process in the frequency domain satisfying @xmath55 by substituting the definition ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) into @xmath56 and using ( [ white_noise ] ) , we immediately arrive at the third relation of ( [ color_noise ] ) .",
    "the other relations are proven in a similar way . from a numerical point of view",
    ", the generation of this coloured noise requires the calculation of the fourier transform in ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) .",
    "a similar algorithm restricted to real noise has been proposed in the past @xcite .    in order to compare our algorithm with the two from @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we choose a test function for which we know @xmath48 and @xmath50 analytically , namely @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we fix @xmath59 as our unit of time and choose the interval @xmath60 $ ] for the numerical fourier transform . to quantify the agreement between the target @xmath48 and the noise generated by the three algorithms",
    ", we use the statistical variance @xmath61).,width=302 ]    in figure [ deltac ] , we report the variance @xmath62 as a function of the number of independent realisations of the noise . we see that the algorithm ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) performs better for a large number of runs ( at least @xmath63 ) , while being close to the other two for a small number of runs .",
    "the algorithm proposed in @xcite suffers from the need of performing a double fourier transform , although for a large number of runs its performance improves consistently . on the other hand",
    ", we can consider the total computation time to generate a given number of realisations . taking the time needed by algorithm ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) as a reference ,",
    "the algorithm of @xcite is about 7% slower and the algorithm of @xcite is about 50% slower .",
    "however , we stress that the main advantage of the algorithm does not lie in the moderate numerical improvement but in the simplification it brings about by only requiring the power spectrum as input .    for illustration",
    ", we show in figure [ single_run ] a single realisation of the noise ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) with 16834 mesh points .",
    "the noise appears as an analytic function of time due to the fact that time enters in @xmath52 via the oscillating term in the right hand side of ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) .",

    "the function @xmath52 appears smooth as a function of time .",
    "notice also that due to the use of the fast fourier transform , the noise is periodic with period given by the largest simulation time .",
    "similar behaviours are obtained with the other two algorithms.,width=302 ]",
    "we would like to illustrate our results by discussing how the tclsse is able to reproduce the dynamics induced by the nmme and how it describes thermal relaxation and energy transfer for specific systems .",
    "these particular examples serve to validate our approach and show the wide range of application the tclsse might have .",
    "we consider the coupling of an electronic system to the electromagnetic field in a three - dimensional cavity . in the dipole approximation",
    ", one can derive from first principles the power spectrum for this system ( we set the speed of light to unity ) , @xmath64\\quad    \\mbox{for}\\quad |\\omega|<\\omega_{c } , \\label{cavity - power - spectrum}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the bose - einstein distribution function , @xmath66 is the heaviside step function , @xmath67 is the volume of the cavity and @xmath68 is a cutoff frequency determined by the dimensions of the system .",
    "this cutoff is necessitated by the assumption made in the dipole approximation that the electromagnetic field is uniform in the region of space occupied by the system .",
    "the derivation of this power spectrum can be found in the appendix . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the power spectrum is set to vanish .",
    "note that increasing @xmath68 does not change the relaxation dynamics as long as @xmath68 is larger than the energy differences in the system and hence does not exclude any transitions .",
    "one can show that the detailed - balance condition ( [ detailed_balance ] ) is satisfied by this power spectrum .",
    "since for this model system the correlation function @xmath48 is not given in analytical form , we will use ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) to generate the noise .    in order to quantify the agreement between the noise generated by ( [ generate_color_noise ] ) and the power spectrum ( [ cavity - power - spectrum ] ) , we have performed a fourier transform of the time - domain signal and compared it to our target .",

    "<S> we show that this stochastic schrdinger equation reproduces the dynamics of a system evolving according to a general non - markovian master equation . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this equation to the relaxation dynamics and to the energy transport of two models of fundamental interest . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a portable algorithm for the generation of the coloured noise associated with the non - markovian dynamics . </S>"
