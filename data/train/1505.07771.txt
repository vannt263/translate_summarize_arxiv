    ".    ever since james watt s steam engine , the urge to explore the fundamental principles governing the performance of cyclic heat engines , was one of the major quests in thermodynamics .",
    "two key figures of merit are particularly important in this context .",
    "while efficiency , the first one , is universally bounded by the carnot value as a direct consequence of the second law , similar constraints on power , the second one , could , so far , be obtained only within specific setups , see for example @xcite .",
    "thermoelectric heat engines , which , in contrast to cyclic ones , work in a steady state @xcite are likewise subject of substantial research efforts concerning efficiency @xcite , power @xcite and the relation between these quantities @xcite . at least in the linear response regime , however , much more general results are currently available for this type of heat engines than for their periodic counterparts .",
    "specifically , it can be shown that , in the linear regime , the power of such devices is bounded by a quadratic function of efficiency that vanishes at the carnot value @xmath0 and attains its maximum at the curzon - ahlborn value @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this result follows from a quite general analysis within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics .",

    "in particular , by using a novel method , which does not require any additional assumptions , we prove that this bound still holds if the matrix of kinetic coefficients is not symmetric , which is the generic case for periodically driven systems . we emphasize that , by now , an analogous result for thermoelectric heat engines is not available on such a general level . to complete our analysis , we show that this bound on power is tight within a paradigmatic model of a brownian heat engine , which was originally proposed in @xcite and recently realized in a landmark experiment @xcite .    the rest of this paper is structured in three major parts . in section",
    "ii , we develop our general formalism and prove a generalized reciprocity relation for the kinetic coefficients of periodic systems .",
    "section iii is devoted to the discussion of cyclic heat engines in the linear response regime and the derivation of a general bound on power .",
    "we illustrate our results by considering a simple model system in section iv .",
    "finally , we conclude in section v.",
    "in this section , we will demonstrate that the notions of irreversible thermodynamics can be transferred to periodically driven systems .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the energetics of driven systems in thermal contact with a heat bath @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider a classical system with degrees of freedom @xmath2 and time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath3 which is immersed in a heat bath , whose temperature @xmath4 oscillates between the two values @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "here , @xmath7 denotes an externally controlled dimensionless function of order @xmath8 and @xmath9 quantifies the strength of this time - dependent perturbation .",
    "the power extracted by the controller thus reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the normalized probability density to find the system in the state @xmath12 at the time @xmath13 and dots indicate time derivatives throughout the paper . to compensate for this loss in internal energy @xmath14",
    "the system picks up the heat @xmath15 from the environment as stipulated by the first law @xmath16    we will now pass from time - dependent to constant variables by exploiting the periodic boundary conditions @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the length of one operation cycle .",
    "quite naturally , we invoke the assumption that , given these conditions , the time evolution of the probability density @xmath11 eventually converges to a periodic limit @xmath19 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_fancy ] for a simple system .",
    "once this periodic state is reached , the average entropy production per cycle arises solely due to heat exchange between the system and the environment , since , due to the periodicity of the the distribution @xmath20 , no net entropy is generated in the system in a full cycle , i.e. , we have @xmath21 by inserting into and parameterizing @xmath4 by a dimensionless function @xmath22 such that @xmath23 it is straightforward to derive the expression @xmath24 using one integration by parts with respect to time .",
    "the corresponding boundary terms vanish due to the periodicity of the involved quantities .",
    "obviously can be cast in the generic form @xcite @xmath25 by identifying the work flux @xmath26 the generalized heat flux @xmath27 and the affinities @xmath28 within only a few lines , we have thus obtained our first main result , namely , we recovered for periodically time - dependent systems the structure of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the key point here is the identification of appropriate pairs of affinities and fluxes , whose respective products sum up to the total entropy production .    for later purposes , we note that , after one integration by part with respect to @xmath13 , the heat flux can be rewritten as @xmath29 where @xmath30        we now focus on the linear regime with respect to the temporal gradients @xmath9 and @xmath31 . by expanding the fluxes and",

    "[ sec_sheboundspoweff ] for a large class of systems .",
    "it is , however , not evident at this stage whether a reciprocity relation relating @xmath38 with @xmath39 or any further constraints exist .      as a first step , we investigate the adiabatic regime , which is characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath40 and the temperature @xmath4 changing slowly enough in time such that the system effectively passes through a sequence of equilibrium states , i.e. , @xmath41/z(t)\\ ] ] with @xmath42\\ ] ] and @xmath43 denoting boltmann s constant .",

    "notably , the coefficients are fully antisymmetric , i.e. , @xmath51 as might be expected , this property , which can be proven by a simple integration by parts with respect to @xmath13 , implies vanishing entropy production in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this avoidance of dissipation can , however , be only achieved for an infinite cycle duration @xmath18 and therefore inevitably comes with vanishing fluxes @xmath52 .      for further investigations of the kinetic coefficients , we have to specify the dynamics , which governs the time evolution of the probability density @xmath11 .",
    "having in mind , in particular , mesoscopic systems surrounded by a fluctuating medium , a suitable choice is given by the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath53 with @xmath54 where summation over identical indices is understood and natural boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath40 and the temperature @xmath4 enter via the drift and diffusion coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which thus become implicitly time - dependent . in the long time limit if the diffusion matrix is strictly positive definite @xcite .",
    "however , it is readily seen that this assertion still holds for physically meaningful scenarios with singular diffusion matrix such as the underdamped dynamics described by kramer s equation @xcite . ]",
    "we will now formulate a set of conditions on the general fokker - planck operator to adapt it to the physical situation that we wish to discuss here .",
    "since micro - reversibility plays a crucial role in linear irreversible thermodynamics , we have to ensure that our theory complies with this fundamental principle .",
    "to this end , first , at any time @xmath13 any possible state @xmath12 of the system must be associated with the same energy as the time - reversed state @xmath57 with @xmath58 for even and @xmath59 for odd variables , i.e. , @xmath60 where , throughout the paper , the transformation @xmath61 is meant to include the reversal of external magnetic fields .",
    "second , the unperturbed fokker - planck operator @xmath62 must obey the detailed balance condition @xcite @xmath63 for the canonical distribution , which uniquely satisfies @xmath64 the dagger showing up in , from here onwards , designates the adjoint of the respective operator .",
    "note that , while in the operator @xmath65 acts on the function @xmath66 , is to be read as an operator identity becoming meaningful when applied to a specific function of @xmath12 .",
    "physically , the relation means that , once the system has reached its equilibrium state , the rate of transitions from the state @xmath12 to the state @xmath67 is balanced by the rate of transitions in the reverse direction .    the equilibrium fokker - planck operator @xmath65 can be naturally decomposed in a reversible and an irreversible contribution @xmath68 which are characterized by their respective behavior under time reversal . while the irreversible part accounts for dissipative effects induced by the presence of the heat bath , the reversible part describes the intrinsic coupling of the system s degrees of freedom , which is not directly affected by the fluctuating environment . since this autonomous part of the dynamics should preserve the internal energy of the system , we have to impose the condition @xmath69 we note that this consideration does not play a role in the overdamped limit , within which the entire time evolution of the system is effectively irreversible due to strongly dominating friction forces .",
    "the notion of detailed balance can not be immediately generalized to situations with external driving and time - dependent temperature .",
    "however , in analogy with , the full fokker - planck operator @xmath70 can still be characterized by the weaker property @xmath71 = 0,\\ ] ] which is naturally obeyed in the absence of nonconservative forces and guarantees that the system follows the correct thermal equilibrium state if the hamiltonian and the temperature are varied quasi - statically .      in the linear response regime ,",
    "the fokker - planck operator @xmath72 showing up in can be replaced by the expansion @xmath73 where , for simplicity , from onwards , we notationally suppress the dependence of any operator on @xmath12 , whenever there is no need to indicate it explicitly .",
    "the fokker - planck equation can then be solved with due consideration of the boundary condition by treating @xmath74 and @xmath75 as first order perturbations .",
    "the result of this standard procedure @xcite reads @xmath76 after some algebra involving condition , which we relegate to appendix [ apx_devoc ] for convenience , this solution leads to the compact expression @xmath77 for the kinetic coefficients , where the generalized equilibrium correlation function is defined as    @xmath78    for arbitrary quantities @xmath48 and @xmath79 .",
    "we recall the definition of the @xmath80-notation .",
    "the expression admits an illuminating physical interpretation .",
    "it shows that the kinetic coefficients of periodically driven can be decomposed into an adiabatic contribution independently identified in and a finite - time correction , which has the form of an equilibrium correlation function .",
    "this result might therefore be regarded as a generalization of the well established green - kubo relations , which relate linear transport coefficients like electric or thermal conductivity to equilibrium correlation functions of the corresponding currents @xcite . in our case , the role of the currents is played by the fluctuation variables @xmath81 and the ensemble average is augmented by a temporal average over one operation cycle .",
    "we note that a similar expression has been obtained for the special case of the effective diffusion constant of a periodically rocked brownian motor in @xcite .",
    "time - reversal symmetry of microscopic dynamics appears as the detailed balance condition on the level of the fokker - planck equation . by using this relation and the green - kubo type formula ,",
    "it is straightforward to derive the generalized reciprocity relation @xmath82   = l_{\\beta\\alpha}\\left[h({\\mathbf{x}},-t),t(-t),-{\\mathbf{b}}\\right],\\ ] ] where , the onsager coefficients are considered as functionals of the time - dependent hamiltonian and temperature and an external magnetic field @xmath83 .",
    "the technical details of the derivation leading to the relation , which constitutes our second main result , can be found in appendix [ apx_rcprel ] . here ,",
    "we emphasize that , although the setup of this paper differs significantly from the one onsager dealt with in his pioneering work @xcite , the symmetry , which constitutes our second main result , and the original onsager relations share microscopic reversibility as the common physical origin . since",
    ", in the presence of time - dependent driving , full time reversal especially includes reversal of the driving protocols , naturally , these reversed protocols show up in .",
    "the symmetry holds individually for both , the adiabatic kinetic coefficients and the finite - time correction showing up in .",
    "given the general relation , it follows that the @xmath84 must vanish if the driving protocols are symmetric under time - reversal .",
    "the additional relation @xmath85 =   l_{\\beta\\alpha}\\left[{\\gamma}_q(t),{\\gamma}_w(t),-{\\mathbf{b}}\\right],\\ ] ] can be proven if the driving @xmath7 introduced in factorizes according to @xmath86 hence , the off - diagonal kinetic coefficients change place if the magnetic field is reversed and the respective protocols determining the time dependence of the hamiltonian and the temperature are interchanged .",
    "this symmetry does not involve the reversed protocols .",
    "it is , however , less universal than , since it requires the special structure , see appendix [ apx_rcprel ] for details .",
    "as a key application of our new approach we will discuss the performance of stochastic heat engines .",
    "the main two benchmark parameters here are , first , the average power output per operation cycle @xmath87 and , second , the efficiency @xmath88 which is bounded by the carnot value @xmath89 as a direct consequence of the second law @xmath90 .",
    "the latter figure , which is naturally suggested by the representation of the entropy production per cycle , should be regarded as a generalization of the conventional thermodynamic efficiency defined for a heat engine operating between two reservoirs of respectively constant temperature .",
    "our formalism includes this scenario as the special case where @xmath91 is chosen as a step function @xmath92 with @xmath93 such that the system is in contact with the hot temperature @xmath94 in the first part of the cycle and the cold temperature @xmath5 in the second one .    under linear response conditions , which we will assume for the rest of this section",
    ", the fluxes @xmath52 can be eliminated using such that the expressions and reduce to @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "clearly , these figures are crucially determined by the kinetic coefficients @xmath38 .",
    "in contrast to the thermoelectric case , where the reciprocity relation @xmath97 holds without magnetic fields , the analysis of the preceding section has revealed that for cyclic heat engines this symmetry is typically broken if the driving protocols are not invariant under time reversal . as pointed out by benenti _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite , a non symmetric matrix of kinetic coefficients leads to profound consequences for the performance of thermoelectric devices including the option of carnot efficiency at finite power .",
    "these results apply similarly to the systems considered here , since our theoretical framework is structurally equivalent to the standard theory of linear irreversible thermodynamics used as a starting point in @xcite . to demonstrate this correspondence explicitly ,",

    "@xmath127 this result is _ a priori _ surprising , since this analysis has fully incorporated the constraints imposed by the second law .      we will now prove the existence of an additional constraint on the kinetic coefficients , which , so far , has been missing in our considerations . to this end",

    "we emphasize that this quite natural result can neither be derived from the laws of thermodynamics nor from micro - reversibility , which appears in form of the reciprocity relation .",
