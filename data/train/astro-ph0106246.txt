    "radio observations of low - power fri ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxies are best interpreted by models in which the jet plasma slows from relativistic ( @xmath3 ) to sub - relativistic ( @xmath4 ) speeds within a few kpc of the nucleus ( laing et al .  1999 ) . decreasing jet asymmetries at sub - kpc to kpc distances from the nucleus can then be understood as the diminishing effect of doppler boosting .",
    "the jets at termination blend into the lobe plasma they supply .",
    "in contrast , the jet asymmetry seen in powerful , frii , sources supports velocities as large as @xmath5 at tens of kpc or more from their cores ( wardle & aaron 1997 ) . bright hotspots mark jet termination in these objects .",
    "the relativistic particles responsible for the jets in fri and frii sources are expected to emit elsewhere in the electromagnetic spectrum , and the x - ray is no exception .",
    "however , it is jet features of the powerful frii sources which have so far yielded the largest number of x - ray detections",
    ". these are ( a ) hotspots in cyg  a ( carilli , perley and harris 1994 ) , 3c  295 ( harris et al .",
    "2000 ) , and 3c  123 ( hardcastle , birkinshaw & worrall 2001a ) , where the x - rays have been interpreted as due to synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission of plasma at minimum energy , ( b ) hotspots in 3c  390.3 ( prieto 1997 ) , 3c  120 ( harris et al .",
    "1999 ) , and pic  a ( wilson , young & shopbell 2001 ) , where the interpretation is less clear , and ( c ) emission associated with large - scale jets in 3c  273 ( marshall et al .",

    "low - power radio galaxies typically reside in group - scale x - ray emitting atmospheres ( worrall & birkinshaw 2000 ) . while the evacuation of the hot x - ray plasma from the radio lobes has apparently been seen in sources such as ngc 1275 ( bhringer et al .",
    "1993 ) , 3c  449 ( hardcastle , worrall & birkinshaw  1998 ) , and m  84 ( finoguenov & jones  2001 ) , and evidence for inverse compton x - rays from the lobes in fornax  a ( feigelson et al .",
    "1995 ) , jet x - ray emission has been reported only in the two nearby low - power sources cen  a ( dbereiner et al .",
    "1996 ; kraft et al .",
    "2000 ) and m  87 ( biretta , stern & harris  1991 ; bhringer et al .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,^,^,<,<,^,<,^ \" , ]     absorption through the galactic column ( table  [ xrayobs ] ) has been applied to all fits .",
    "intrinsic column density is applied only to the power law components : it is neither required nor usefully constrained in the fits for 0206 + 35 .",
    "errors are @xmath6 for one interesting parameter .",
    "upper limits are @xmath7 significance .",
    "the x - ray spectral fits to the net counts within a radius of 10 arcsec around each source ( table  [ spectraltab ] ) support the spatial modelling .",
    "while b2  0331 + 39 gives an acceptable fit to a power law , the other two sources either give unacceptable fits to single - component models ( power law or raymond - smith thermal ) , or @xmath8 improves significantly when the second component is added .",
    "the normalizations of the power - law and thermal models in the two - component fits imply a division of counts between core@xmath9jet and gas which agrees well with the spatial separation of components .",
    "the gas has a temperature reasonable for its luminosity as compared with the extrapolation of the temperature - luminosity relationship for the larger - scale group / cluster atmospheres around low - power radio galaxies ( see figure  7 of worrall & birkinshaw 2001 ) .",
    "our _ rosat _ studies of low - power radio galaxies had separated some of the pspc emission into thermal gas associated with the group or cluster ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 , 2000 ) , and attributed the remaining compact emission , or that unresolved with the hri ( canosa et al .",
    "1999 ) , to a component associated with the small - scale radio structures .",
    "although _ chandra _ resolves a fraction of the emission we previously associated with the agn ( compare table 4 of canosa et al .",
    "2000 with table  [ xraytab ] ) , our description of a low - power radio galaxy as emitting significant small - scale radio - related x - ray emission is confirmed .",
    "_ chandra s _ superior spatial resolution reveals power - law emission from an unresolved core in all three sources , and x - ray jets in the two sources with small - scale radio jets .",
    "although three is too small a sample to claim a correlation , it is interesting that the core radio flux densities ( which are assumed typical in having flat radio spectra ) are in the same rank order as the core x - ray flux densities .",
    "the core x - ray spectra are soft .",
    "a small intrinsic absorption of a few 10@xmath10 @xmath11 is measured in b2  0331 + 39 , and an upper limit for b2  0755 + 37 allows for comparable amounts .",
    "such absorption is consistent with expectations from the dusty medium which _ hst _ finds to be typical in such radio galaxies : compare the detailed analysis of ferrarese & ford ( 1999 ) for one source with the general findings concerning dust in b2 radio galaxies of capetti et al .  (",
    "it remains plausible that the core x - ray emission is associated with the relativistic particles directly responsible for vlbi - scale radio emission , as our earlier work suggested ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 ) .",
    "the galaxy - scale gas may play a role in the confinement , disruption , or slowing of the jets in the crucial region within a few kpc of the nucleus .",
    "calculations of internal jet pressures are model dependent . in table",
    "[ radiotab ] we give values for the minimum pressure on the simplest assumption that the jets are in the plane of the sky and that relativistic effects can be ignored .",
    "the effects of relativistic beaming and projection will tend to reduce these values , by a factor of about four in the case of bondi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) s model for b2  0755 + 35 .",
    "it is interesting that the kpc - scale jet pressures are similar to the central gas pressures .",
    "deeper _ chandra _ x - ray observations are needed for detailed modelling of the interface between the gas and jet plasma , such as in our study of b2  0104 + 32 ( 3c  31 : hardcastle et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the _ chandra _ observations of b2 radio galaxies support the general picture of a low - power radio galaxy having galaxy - scale gas , a compact x - ray core , and x - ray jet emission associated with fast , one - sided , kpc - scale , radio jets .",
    "the presence also of group- or cluster - scale gas is known from _ rosat _ , but this appears as structureless background in our high - resolution , reduced field - of - view , _ chandra _ images .    for both sources with radio and x - ray jet emission ,",
    "the jet emission is an appreciable fraction of the core emission ( of order 20 - 50 per cent ) in both the x - ray and radio .",
    "this similarity of x - ray to radio ratio for the jets and cores argues in favour of the core and jet x - ray components both being radio - related in origin , supporting our earlier conclusions ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 ) .",
    "contending emission mechanisms for the jet x - rays are synchrotron radiation from particles of higher energy than those contributing the radio emission , or compton scattering of jet - produced or external photons .",
    "the x - ray spectrum can help to decide between these possibilities , since it has a direct relationship to the spectrum of the particles responsible for the radiation .",
    "a steep x - ray spectrum would tend to rule out a compton - scattering origin , and instead suggest synchrotron emission from high - energy electrons of steeper spectrum than those emitting in the radio . in b2  0331 + 39",
    "the x - ray spectrum is indeed steep , but these shallow x - ray observations lead to constraints that are too poor to draw useful conclusions for b2  0206 + 35 and 0755 + 37 .",
    "however , the x - ray flux levels of the jets are most easily explained by a synchrotron model .",
    "synchrotron self - compton emission with an equipartition magnetic field produces an x - ray flux density @xmath12 orders of magnitude below the observed value , using the jet parameters given in table  [ radiotab ] .",
    "fri jets are generally thought to move too slowly (  1 ) for the effective energy density in microwave - background photons to be significantly increased by boosting ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ) , and , even if the regions concerned do have very high flow velocities , the jets are unlikely to be close enough to the line of sight for the mechanism to be important .",
    "the dominant photon population in the jets is likely to be beamed radiation from the active nuclei , and although estimates of the inverse compton x - ray yield are strongly model dependent , we find they are likely to fall short by an order of magnitude under plausible assumptions ( hardcastle , birkinshaw & worrall  2001b ) .",
    "a synchrotron model requires a steepening of the spectral index between the radio and x - ray if it is not to over - produce the x - rays , but such spectral breaks are observed in well - studied optical synchrotron jets such as m87 and 3c  66b , for which multiwavelength data are compiled in hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "it is easier to detect jet x - ray emission with _",
    "chandra _ than jet optical emission with _ hst _ , at least for sources with relatively high core dominances such as these . in two out of our three sample sources , and both of those with kpc - scale radio jets , x - ray jets are detected .",
    "in contrast , capetti et al .  ( 2000 ) report detection of only three of 57 representative b2 radio galaxies observed in an _ hst _ snapshot survey , even though roughly 45 per cent of all b2 radio galaxies have kpc - scale radio jets ( parma et al .  1987 ) .",
    "interestingly , b2  0755 + 37 is one of the three sources with detected optical jets , and so more detailed modelling of the spectral energy distribution of this jet will be possible .",
    "we are currently analysing data for five other low - power radio galaxies that we have observed more recently with _",
    "chandra _ , two of which are from the b2 sample , and all five show jet features . at the spatial resolution possible with _ chandra _ , x - ray jets are indeed common .",
    "as more data are forthcoming it should be possible to make a detailed study of the underlying physics which controls the strength of x - ray emission in these low - power jets .",
    "we thank marco bondi for the processed merlin image of b2  0755 + 37 , john biretta and paola parma for use of their vla archival data on b2  0206 + 35 and b2  0331 + 39 , respectively , and staff of the cxc for help concerning calibrations and the ciao and ds9 software ."
