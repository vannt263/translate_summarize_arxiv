    "the symbiotic recurrent nova ( syrn ) v407  cyg consists of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a mira - type red giant ( rg , @xcite ) . in march 2010 ,",
    "the gamma - ray emission from its outburst was detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat ( large area telescope , @xcite ) , showing the first evidence for a gamma - ray nova @xcite .",
    "another gamma - ray syrn , v745  sco , was also detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat in february 2014 @xcite .",
    "since the rgs in symbiotic binaries could produce a high - density circumstellar medium ( csm ) through their stellar wind , gamma - ray emission in syrne could originate in high - energy particle acceleration that happens when blast waves pass through the high - density csm .    recently ,",
    "classical novae ( cne ) have also been classified as a new type of gamma - ray source @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of a high - density csm in cne can not explain the origin of gamma - ray emission as in syrne , requiring a new mechanism for gamma - ray cne .",
    "@xcite studied the high - resolution radio maps of the gamma - ray cn v959  mon , proposing that the fast binary motion in cne could shape the nova ejecta by transferring its angular momentum .",
    "therefore , high - energy particles could be accelerated at the interface between equatorial and polar regions .    since particle acceleration in cne and syrne",
    "is highly associated with shock propagation in their nova eruptions , these new discoveries motivate us to study the shock evolution in nova systems . additionally , syrne have long been considered as type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) progenitors @xcite , although the nature of the progenitor systems of sne  ia remains uncertain .",
    "however , evidence of interaction between sn ia ejecta with a csm has been found in some sne  ia in late - type spiral galaxies @xcite , suggesting that at least some sne  ia could originate in symbiotic binaries .",
    "the gamma - ray emission from the 2010 outburst of v407  cyg has been studied by through a semi - analytical study of diffusive shock acceleration and non - thermal emission in v407  cyg .",
    "they found that the observed gamma - ray light curve could be fitted by requiring a circumbinary density enhancement ( cde ) around the wd .",
    "multi - dimensional hydrodynamics simulations by @xcite further support the need for a cde around the wd .",
    "they simulated a blast wave passing through a dense csm in v407  cyg including a sophisticated treatment of thermal conduction and radiative cooling @xcite , finding that the observed x - ray light curves could be reproduced if a cde exists around the wd .",
    "however , they do not include the asymmetric effect of binary motion , and the distribution of cde is artificially imposed in their simulations without modeling the wd - wind interaction in the quiescent phase .",
    "on the other hand , performed three - dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of another syrn , rs  oph , from the quiescent phase to a nova eruption . in their simulations",
    ", they found a disk - like cde concentrated in the orbital plane , and their shock evolution is consistent with the observations of the 2006 nova outburst @xcite .",
    "although some similarity between rs  oph and v407  cyg has been found in their eruptions spectra , the physical parameters of the binary systems are quite different @xcite , especially for their orbital periods ( separations ) .",
    "the orbital period in rs  oph is much shorter ( @xmath3  yr ) than in v407  cyg ( @xmath4  yr ) .",
    "therefore , the amount and distribution of density enhancement could be different in these two systems .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the evolution of the syrn v407  cyg from the quiescent phase to a nova eruption . in the next section",
    ", we review and summarize some observational facts about the binary system of v407  cyg and its previous outbursts .",
    "the numerical methods and the initial setup are presented in section  [ sec_methods ] .",
    "our simulation results with different red giant wind loss rates and nova eruption parameters are reported and discussed in section  [ sec_results ] . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our results and conclude .",
    "as mentioned in the above section , the syrn v407  cyg consists of a massive wd and a mira - type m6  iii rg @xcite .",
    "the mira - type rg has a pulsation period of @xmath5  day @xcite . from the dust obscuration and the long - term optical light curve , an orbital period of @xmath6  yr",
    "was inferred by @xcite , corresponding to an orbital separation of @xmath7  au for a @xmath8 rg and a @xmath9 wd .",
    "the distance of v407  cyg is still unclear . some distance estimates using the period - luminosity relation",
    "give a range from @xmath10  kpc @xcite to @xmath11  kpc @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggest a possible distance @xmath12  kpc using the interstellar na  i d absorption lines , since the period - luminosity relation is not well established for the long pulsation period of v407  cyg @xcite ( see a more detailed argument in @xcite ) .    v407  cyg has been monitored in the optical for more than seven decades .",
    "three nova eruptions were reported in 1936 , 1998 , and 2010 @xcite , although some undetected eruptions could have happened in this interval .",
    "the march 2010 eruption is the most interesting due to the use of modern astronomical instrumentation and the detection of gamma - rays . from the measurement of an @xmath13 emission line - width , an ejecta mass @xmath14 , eruption energy @xmath15  ergs , and ejecta speed @xmath16  km  s@xmath2",
    "could be estimated @xcite .",
    "an ejecta mass of @xmath17 could also reproduce the observed velocity evolution , but may underestimate the rg mass loss rate @xcite .",
    "in general , the observed mass loss rate @xmath18 of a mira giant spans a wide range , varying from @xmath19  yr@xmath2 to @xmath20  yr@xmath2 with an average @xmath21  yr@xmath2 @xcite . the radio light curve from the 2010 outburst of v407",
    "cyg suggests a mass loss rate @xmath22  yr@xmath2 ( for @xmath23  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath24  kpc ; @xcite ) , but this mass loss rate is one order of magnitude higher than the estimated value from the x - ray light curve ( @xmath25  yr@xmath2 , ) . to obtain better agreement between the x - ray and radio estimates , a binary separation wider than 16  au",
    "may be required @xcite .",
    "the wind speed of a giant star correlates with the star s luminosity . taking account of the observed luminosity @xmath26 @xcite and",
    "the uncertainty of the distance of v407  cyg , a rg wind speed of @xmath27  km  s@xmath2 can be estimated .",
    "in addition , a wind speed of @xmath28  km  s@xmath2 could be also estimated from the optical p  cygni line profiles @xcite . however",
    ", a higher wind speed of @xmath29  km  s@xmath2 is estimated from the equivalent width of the na  i d lines in the quiescent phase @xcite and in the eruption phase .",
    "the simulation code used in this study is flash  version  4 @xcite .",
    "flash is a grid - based , parallel , multidimensional hydrodynamics code based on block - structured adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) .",
    "the split piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) solver @xcite is used to solve for the motion of compressible fluids .",
    "we use active particle clouds to represent the wd and the core of the rg companion .",
    "particle clouds are utilized instead of single particles to avoid the force anisotropy problem in cloud - in - cell interpolation @xcite .",
    "gravitational forces between particle clouds and gas and self - gravity are solved using a multigrid poisson solver @xcite .",
    "nuclear burning is ignored in our simulations , since it takes place in the envelope of the white dwarf , which is not resolved .",
    "we also assume that magnetic fields do not affect the shock evolution .      to model",
    "v407  cyg and its 2010 eruption , we consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulation box with a size of 400  au  @xmath30  400  au  @xmath30  400  au .",
    "initially , a @xmath8 rg is located at the center ( origin ) of the simulation box , and a @xmath9 wd is located on the positive @xmath31axis with a binary separation of 16  au , corresponding to an orbital period of about 43  yr . the orbital plane is set on the @xmath32 plane and the direction of angular momentum is set to be the positive @xmath33axis .",
    "particle clouds representing the wd and the rg have a radius of @xmath34  cm , which is slightly larger than three smallest zone spacings ( @xmath35  cm ) .",
    "we use 9 levels of refinement based on the magnitudes of the second derivatives of gas density and pressure .",
    "each amr block contains @xmath36 zones in the 3d simulation box , corresponding to an effective uniform resolution of @xmath37 . to save computation time",
    ", we reduce the maximum amr level based on the distance to the center of mass , giving an effective resolution of @xmath38 at the @xmath39th level of amr , where @xmath40 is the distance to the center of mass of the wd - rg binary .",
    "the highest resolution region contains the central 65  au and the first forced amr decrement occurs at @xmath41  au .",
    "the second amr decrement occurs at @xmath42  au , the third at @xmath43  au , and so on .",
    "outflow boundary conditions for fluids and isolated boundary conditions for the poisson solver are used .",
    "we assume the rg has a radius of @xmath44  au , a constant wind speed @xmath45  km  s@xmath2 in the co - rotating frame , and a constant mass loss rate @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the initial gas density @xmath46 is distributed using equation  [ eq_rho ] : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the distance to the rg .",
    "we assume a gamma - law equation of state with @xmath49 and wind temperature @xmath50  k to mimic the thermodynamic behavior of gas based on photoionization models of symbiotic binary systems .",
    "we perform quiescent - phase simulations up to @xmath51 orbital periods , since the density distribution becomes quasi - steady in the co - rotating frame after about @xmath52 orbital periods . during the quiescent phase , we reset the rg wind using equation  [ eq_rho ] for the region with @xmath53  au to maintain the rg wind .",
    "to model a syrn eruption , we artificially impose a sedov - like explosion on the location of the wd .",
    "the eruption has an ejecta mass @xmath54 , eruption energy @xmath55 , and averaged ejecta speed @xmath56 . to avoid grid effects",
    ", the eruption covers a small spherical region with a radius equal to fifteen smallest zone spacings @xcite . within the erupting region ,",
    "a uniform density distribution and linear velocity profile in radius are used .",
    "we assume the kinetic energy is three - fourths of the total eruption energy @xcite .",
    "the mass and kinetic energy of the cde within the exploding region and the orbital speed of the wd are added to the eruption .",
    "once the syrn eruption is imposed , we reduce the resetting radius for the rg wind to the radius of the rg , and assume a completely absorbing surface on the rg . in reality , this assumption is not precisely correct , and a reverse shock should be generated when the ejecta reach the surface of the rg .",
    "we ignore these effects since the purpose of the paper is not to focus on the response of the rg , but on the global shock evolution .",
    "we perform runs with several different sets of values for the rg wind and syrn eruption parameters , such as @xmath57 , and @xmath54 ( see table  [ tab_simulations ] ) , and present our simulation results in this section . in the first subsection , the evolution of wind focused by the wd during the quiescent phase is described .",
    "the asymmetry due to wd - wind interaction is investigated as well . in section  [ sec_eruption ] , we study the shock evolution dependence on different rg wind loss rates and different eruption energies and ejecta masses .      we perform two quiescent - phase simulations by varying the mass loss rate from @xmath58  yr@xmath2 ( model  m6 ) to @xmath59  yr@xmath2 ( model  m7 ; see table :  [ tab_simulations ] ) to study the effects on the cde .",
    "the quiescent phase evolution of both models is qualitatively the same , but the gas density distributions scale with their mass loss rates . in this subsection , we take model  m6 as the reference simulation and describe the quiescent - phase evolution in detail .",
    "figure  [ fig_m6_dens_x - y ] demonstrates a typical evolution of the gas density in the orbital plane during the quiescent phase ( model  m6 ) . since the initial wind density distribution ( see equation  [ eq_rho ] ) neglects the binary interaction , a turbulent and hot spiral arm quickly forms when the rg wind interacts with the wd .",
    "this turbulent spiral arm takes about an orbital period ( @xmath60  yr ) to reach a quasi - steady large - scale state in the co - rotating frame .",
    "we also show the corresponding gas temperature distribution in figure  [ fig_m6_temp_x - y ] .",
    "the wd gravitationally deflects matter in its vicinity .",
    "figure  [ fig_accretions ] shows the mass within control surfaces for different radii for our models m6 and m7 .",
    "it is clear that the enclosed mass increases for the first few years and then reaches stability after about 10  yr . since the rg wind speed is higher than the orbital speed of the wd , the wd experiences a strong wind which limits the amount of mass enclosed within the control surface .",
    "therefore , we observe no significant wind - capture disk around the wd as reported by , since the wind speed relative to the orbital speed is much higher than that in rs  oph . however , we do observe a small , elongated , disk - shaped structure around the wd with a size about 5  au ( see figure  [ fig_disc ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the fast simulation case ( @xmath61  km  s@xmath2 ) of rs  oph in @xcite , since the orbital speed of rs  oph ( @xmath62  km  s@xmath2 ) is much faster than that in v407  cyg ( @xmath63  km  s@xmath2 ) , giving a similar orbital to wind speed ratio of @xmath64 .",
    "we note , however , that the enclosed mass is not gravitationally bound to the wd . as the wd ( @xmath65  cm )",
    "is not resolved in our simulations , we can not determine the mass accreted by the wd .    for @xmath66  au",
    ", the enclosed mass is enhanced up to @xmath67 times , independent of the radius of the control surface and the mass loss rate .",
    "qualitatively , the models m6 and m7 behave similarly , but the density is one order of magnitude higher in model  m6 than in model  m7 . in addition , a short - period oscillation ( @xmath68  yr ) in the enclosed mass is also observed .",
    "this prompt oscillation reflects the dynamical timescale around the wd due to the interaction between the colliding rg wind and the turbulent flow behind the wd .    the cde , including the spiral arm , is concentrated in the equatorial plane .",
    "however , the cde does not form a thin disk , but instead shows a mild anisotropy .",
    "this is due to a relatively large pressure scale height ( @xmath69 ) in v407  cyg , where @xmath70 is the angular velocity .",
    "figures  [ fig_m6_dens_r - z ] and [ fig_m6_temp_r - z ] show the gas column density and gas density - weighted temperature distribution as viewed from within the orbital plane .",
    "the density enhancement is only about @xmath71 , but the temperature can be heated to @xmath72  k. the opening angle of the spiral arm is about @xmath73 degrees . as described above , when the rg wind collides with the wd , some gas periodically puffs out from the wd and forms the ring - like density distribution in figure  [ fig_m6_dens_r - z ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_m6 ] and [ fig_m7 ] show the angle - averaged density profiles of models  m6 and m7 within surface of cones having different inclination angles .",
    "each density profile is averaged from 180 uniformly distributed radial rays in a given inclination angle and each radial ray is sampled from the surface of the rg to the boundary of the simulation box . from the upper panels , the averaged density profiles still follow the @xmath74 distribution , but with about @xmath75 variation for different inclination angles .",
    "it is also clear that the density distribution at about @xmath76  au is highly concentrated in the region with @xmath77 . beyond this scale ,",
    "the asymmetry is small and only affected at high inclination angles .",
    "we have also performed a low - resolution run by reducing the maximum amr level to 8 and enlarging the finest zone size to @xmath78  cm , corresponding to a factor of 2 larger than the standard resolution . in this low - resolution run",
    ", the spiral arm qualitatively looks the same as in the standard run , and the averaged density distribution looks the same as well , but the turbulence is slightly suppressed due to a higher numerical viscosity .",
    "the enclosed mass within the same control surface ( @xmath79 ) is about @xmath80 higher than the standard run .",
    "it should be noted that in our model we assume a constant rg wind speed during the whole quiescent - phase simulation .",
    "however , in reality the rg wind is driven by radiation pressure on dust formed above the stellar surface during the mira giant s pulsation .",
    "the wind acceleration zone could extend to about @xmath81 @xcite , which is comparable to the binary separation in v407  cyg .",
    "therefore , the wind speed could be less than what we have assumed when it collides with the wd , implying that our estimate of the cde could be low .      after running for two orbital periods in the quiescent - phase simulations ,",
    "we impose a nova eruption on the wd .",
    "we perform two eruption simulations with two different eruption energies ( @xmath82  erg and @xmath83  erg ) and ejecta masses ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) for each quiescent - phase simulation . since we assume that the averaged ejecta speed is @xmath86  km / sec and the kinetic energy ( @xmath87 ) is three - fourths of the total eruption energy at the onset of eruption @xcite , a higher eruption energy implies a larger ejecta mass in that eruption , and vice versa . in total , we have four different sets of 3d eruption simulations as described in table  [ tab_simulations ] . in section  [ sec_description ]",
    ", we adopt model m6e44 as the reference simulation to describe the overall evolution in the eruption phase .",
    "we also discuss the shock evolution in all our models in section  [ sec_shock ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_m6e44_dens_x - y ] shows a typical gas density distribution for v407  cyg in the orbital plane after a nova eruption . in this case ( model  m6e44 in table  [ tab_simulations ] ) , the mass loss rate of the rg wind is @xmath88  yr@xmath2 , the ejecta mass is @xmath89 , and the eruption energy is @xmath83  erg . at about one week after the eruption , the forward shock sweeps out the rg wind and the spiral arm ( label  a ) , and forms a reverse shock propagating backward to the wd ( label  b ) .",
    "the two shocks are separated by a contact discontinuity . at @xmath90  days ,",
    "the forward shock reaches the rg .",
    "the propagation of the forward shock and the reverse shock can be seen in figure  [ fig_ray_m6e44 ] .",
    "note that although we assume the rg completely absorbs the forward shock when it reaches the surface of the rg , it does not affect the propagation of the reverse shock from the eruption .",
    "subsequently , rayleigh - taylor instabilities quickly develop ( label  c in figure  [ fig_m6e44_dens_x - y ] ) .",
    "after the forward shock passing through the rg , the rg wind and the cde are shocked and heated ( label  d )",
    ". these hot and dense plasma could be the source of x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the self - interaction of rayleigh - taylor bubbles and the interaction of the forward shock with the spiral arm produce additional reverse shocks as well .",
    "when these reverse shocks collide with each other , filament - like shocks form at about 70  days after the eruption ( label  e ) .",
    "after 70  days , the forward shock has slowed down because of the positive density gradient toward the rg , forming a heart - shaped structure .",
    "once the forward shock has passed the rg , a high - density tail at the back side of the rg is formed ( label  f ) . within the forward shock ,",
    "several filaments are formed and destroyed repeatedly due to the interaction of the reverse shocks ( label  g ) .",
    "the turbulent spiral arm is completely destroyed by the forward shock .",
    "the corresponding gas temperature distribution is shown in figure  [ fig_m6e44_temp_x - y ] .",
    "it is clear that the temperature distribution is highly asymmetric due to the rg wind interaction and rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "high mach number shocks are associated with the forward shock , starting from @xmath91 in the first week and then decreasing with time .",
    "once the rayleigh - taylor instabilities have developed , the mach number decreases to @xmath92 and is maintained at this level for several months .",
    "a 3d volume rendering of the gas density distribution right before and after ( @xmath93  day ) a nova eruption is shown in figure  [ fig_vr_m6e44 ] .",
    "the orange color shows the location of the forward shock .",
    "several filaments and rayleigh - taylor bubbles can also be seen .    in figure",
    "[ fig_m6e44_dens_r - z ] and [ fig_m6e44_temp_r - z ] , we show the gas column density and gas density - weighted temperature distribution in the @xmath94 plane ( edge - on view ) , to demonstrate the aspherical evolution of the shock radius due to the cde . as we described in the previous subsection , the cde makes the density @xmath0 asymmetric at different inclination angles .",
    "therefore , although the ejecta speed is much higher than the orbital speed and the gravitational binding energy of the cde is much less than the eruption energy , the ejecta speed greatly decreases in the equatorial direction due to the cde and the rg wind .",
    "the ratio of the shock radius in the poleward and equatorial directions is about @xmath95 , depending on the location of the rg .",
    "@xcite have performed simulations of the 2010 eruption of v407  cyg with an artificial cde .",
    "they found that the observed x - ray emission could be reproduced if there is a cde around the wd , but is not required if the outburst energy and ejecta mass are near the upper end of the range for these characteristics for classical novae , which would be extreme for syrn . comparing the results of their best - fitting simulation model with cde , e44.3-nw7-cde6.3-l40 with our results for model m7e44",
    ", we find that their forward shock expands more spherically and about twice as fast as that found here .",
    "@xcite found that most x - ray emission originates from the shocked csm .",
    "the observed x - ray emission reaches a maximum at around 40 days after the eruption and declines after 50 days .",
    "this corresponds to the time when the rg wind and the cde are heated by the shock in our simulations ( see label  d in figure  [ fig_m6e44_dens_x - y ] ) .",
    "a lower shock expansion velocity in our simulations in comparison with @xcite may affect the shape of simulated x - ray lightcurve .",
    "however , we note that the initial averaged ejecta velocity @xmath96  km  s@xmath2 in @xcite is probably too high based on recent observations @xcite .",
    "since the nova eruption completely destroys the cde and creates a cavity that contains the binary system at the end of the simulation , the subsequent circumstellar density distribution will need several years to decades to reestablish the original wind profile ( equation  [ eq_rho ] ) .",
    "the last recorded nova eruption of v407  cyg prior to the 2010 eruption was in 1998 . assuming that there were no undetected eruptions between the 1998 and 2010 eruptions and the rg wind has a constant wind speed of 20  km  s@xmath2",
    ", the newly developed wind profile could only reach to about @xmath97  au in distance .",
    "therefore , our initial wind profile ( equation  [ eq_rho ] ) may not be valid at large distances , which may affect our shock evolution at late times ( @xmath98  months for model m6e44 ) .",
    "if we reduce the resolution by a factor of 2 as we did in the quiescent - phase simulations , we see no notable difference in the shock locations within @xmath99  au , but the rayleigh - taylor instabilities are less obvious due to a higher numerical viscosity .",
    "the filaments produced by the interaction of reverse shocks are slightly less clear than in the standard run , but overall the evolution does not change significantly .      understanding the shock evolution in nova eruptions is crucial , since",
    "the high - energy charged particles required for the nonthermal gamma - ray and radio emission are likely produced in the shock front .",
    "overall , the simulation results for the shock positions and evolution during the eruption phase runs are qualitatively similar , but quantitatively very different .",
    "therefore , in this subsection we describe the shock evolution of our four eruption simulations in detail .    figure  [ fig_shock_m6e44 ] to figure  [ fig_shock_m7e43 ] show the shock evolution in all the eruption simulations .",
    "at the very beginning of a nova eruption ( @xmath100  week ) , the eruption is nearly free - expanding and the shock location is nearly spherically symmetric . since the kinetic energy is the dominant form of energy at that time and we assume the initial averaged ejecta speed is the same in different runs , the shock radius evolution is similar in all cases .",
    "however , later on , when the ejecta sweep up enough mass , the forward shock slows down due to momentum conservation .",
    "the decline rate depends on the eruption energy and the rg mass loss rate .",
    "for instance , if we lower the eruption energy or the ejecta mass by an order of magnitude ( case  m6e43 ) , the shock location would be slowed down by a factor of @xmath101 at @xmath102  days ( figure  [ fig_shock_m6e43 ] ) .",
    "similarly , with the same eruption energy , the shock would propagate much faster if the surrounding cde were less dense ( figure  [ fig_shock_m7e44 ] ) .",
    "@xcite and have described a simple semi - analytical model for the shock evolution by comparing the circumstellar mass distribution with the ejecta mass plus swept mass using momentum conservation . in their model ,",
    "the density distribution is described by a 1d wind profile ( equation  [ eq_rho ] ) plus a cde .",
    "the cde is assumed to be a gaussian distribution which can be described by @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are density and length scale parameters .",
    "we perform similar calculations by comparing the shock location of our 3d hydrodynamic simulations with the semi - analytical model described by .    to find the most suitable sets of parameter values , we apply two constraints .",
    "first , we assume the @xmath104 in model m6 is one order of magnitude higher than that in m7 , i.e.  @xmath107 , based on the analysis from figure  [ fig_m6 ] and [ fig_m7 ] .",
    "second , we assume the length - scale parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 are equal , since we do not observe significant asymmetry in the local density enhancement around the wd . by applying these two constraints ,",
    "a best - fit set of parameter values is : for m7 , @xmath108  au and @xmath109  g  @xmath110 ; and for m6 , @xmath108  au and @xmath111  g  @xmath110 .",
    "the best - fit shock evolution is shown using the red dotted lines in figures  [ fig_shock_m6e44 ] - [ fig_shock_m7e43 ] .    the best fit model in @xcite , which can reproduce the x - ray lightcurve , corresponds to their model e44.3-nw7-cde6.3-l40 .",
    "it is characterized by an ejecta mass of @xmath112 , eruption energy @xmath113  erg , @xmath114  g  @xmath110 , and @xmath115  au .",
    "the cde in this model is comparable to , in order of magnitude , with our model m7 , but is less concentrated .",
    "however , as described above , the ejecta speed in @xcite is much faster than adopted in our work .",
    "figure  [ fig_shock_time ] shows the averaged forward shock evolution in the orbital plane and poleward regions of all considered models in table  [ tab_simulations ] .",
    "the shock radius evolution can be characterized as @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is an evolution stage - dependent constant .",
    "depending on the model , @xmath117 is around @xmath118 during the first week . at the beginning ,",
    "the ejecta are nearly spherically symmetric , but the angle - averaged forward shock evolves slightly faster in the orbital plane than in the poleward direction due to the orbital motion . later on , the shock interaction with the rg reduces the angle - averaged shock speed in the orbital plane , making @xmath117 decrease a little for @xmath119  days . after about @xmath120 days , the forward shock is far beyond the rg , and @xmath117 increases again .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the result in , but for a different time scale due to differences in binary parameters .",
    "furthermore , if we increase the rg mass loss rate ( from model m7e44 to m6e44 or model m7e43 to m6e43 ) or decrease the eruption energy ( model m6e43 to m6e44 or model m7e43 to m7e44 ) , @xmath117 becomes lower .",
    "the angle - averaged shock speed decreases greatly due to the sweeping out of the rg wind . starting from a value of @xmath121  km  s@xmath2 at the onset of the nova eruption , the average shock speed in the radial direction drops to @xmath122  km  s@xmath2 after about a year .",
    "the evolution of shock speed can be characterized as another power - law relation with an index of @xmath123 ( figure  [ fig_shock_time ] ) .",
    "the speed evolution in figure  [ fig_shock_time ] is roughly consistent with the spherically symmetric simulation of @xcite . in their simulation , a better treatment of the radiative cooling during shock expansion",
    "is implemented , but only in 1d .",
    "our shock speed is also comparable with the observed ejecta speed ( star symbols in figure  [ fig_shock_time ] ) of @xmath124  km  s@xmath2 on day @xmath125 and @xmath126  km  s@xmath2 on day @xmath127 from the fwhm of the broad component of @xmath128 @xcite . by fitting the simulated ejecta speed with observations ,",
    "the best - matched models are m6e44 and m7e43 .",
    "furthermore , the 2011 april observation also shows that the maximum velocity is @xmath129  km  s@xmath2 , which is also consistent with our simulations .",
    "the decrement of nova ejecta speed with the existence of a cde in our simulations is also consistent with the observed ejecta velocity decrement in rs  oph .",
    "we have investigated the symbiotic recurrent nova v407  cyg from the quiescent phase to a nova eruption via three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations . in quiescent - phase simulations , we examined two different mass loss rates of the mira - type rg .",
    "we studied the cde produced due to the wind - wd interaction in v407  cyg .",
    "it is found that the induced spiral accretion wake in v407  cyg is more turbulent and the cde is less efficient than found in rs  oph due to a relatively high wind - to - orbital speed ratio .",
    "in addition , we observe no significant wind - captured disk around the wd as reported by in rs  oph , though the angle - averaged radial density profile in the equatorial plane is about @xmath80 higher than that in the poleward direction .",
    "the shock evolution in the eruption phase also is studied .",
    "it is found that the forward shock location is highly dependent on the inclination angle , nova eruption energy , and circumstellar density distribution .",
    "the forward and reverse shock interactions with the rg wind and cde are also crucial factors in the overall evolution .",
    "in addition , the shock radius evolution can be characterized by a power law , @xmath130 , where @xmath117 is about @xmath131 , depending on model and evolution stage .",
    "our model m6e44 ( @xmath132 and @xmath133  erg ) and model m7e43 ( @xmath134 and @xmath135  erg ) show good agreement with the observed ejecta speed from @xcite .",
    "the shock evolution in the presence of cde in our simulations is similar to what has been observed in v407  cyg and rs  oph",
    ".    further work in this series of papers will include investigation of thermal and non - thermal emission in v407  cyg and other symbiotic nova systems at different wavelengths , in particular in gamma - ray , x - ray , and radio .",
    "similar analysis can be applied to other rne and cne as well .",
