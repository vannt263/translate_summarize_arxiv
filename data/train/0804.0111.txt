    "the purposes of this study are ( 1 ) to make clear the distribution of the quiescent molecular gas and to compare it with star formation activity , ( 2 ) to describe the chemical evolution in the omc-2/3 region , ( 3 ) to compare the physical properties of n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores in the orion massive star - forming region with those in the low - mass star forming dark cloud found in taurus , and ( 4 ) to investigate variation in n@xmath1h@xmath2 core properties along the `` @xmath0-shaped filament .

    "the total length of the filament is about 12 pc , and the figures exhibit filamentary and clumpy structure well .",

    "these maps show that the n@xmath1h@xmath2 distribution resembles the dust continuum distribution very well .",
    "for example , v - shaped structure about 15@xmath19 south of orion kl is very clear in both maps .",
    "however , it should be noted that the orion bar , which is prominent in the dust continuum , is not seen in n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 is known to be sensitive to quiescent molecular gas , while the dust continuum is sensitive to the photodissociation region ( pdr ) .",
    "the dust distribution is thinner in width and more compact than the n@xmath1h@xmath2 distribution , because structures with scales larger than the largest chopper throw ( 65@xmath26 ) are missing from the dust continuum map .",
    "we identified n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores by using two sets of the velocity channel maps .",
    "the first set is 0.3 km s@xmath13-width velocity channel maps of the @xmath33 , @xmath35 = 0 , 1@xmath41 , 2 component , which is an isolated component of the seven hyperfine components .",
    "the advantage of this set is that we can separate molecular gas having different velocities easily .",

    "this hyperfine group has three components in the velocity range of less than 2 km s@xmath13 , and it is hard to derive detailed velocity structure . on the other hand , we can detect molecular gas having weaker intensities with this set . by taking advantages of these two sets ,",
    "we have identified a total of 34 molecular cloud cores in n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the identification by eye and properties of n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores .",
    "the value after @xmath11 in the antenna temperature , excitation temperature , optical depth , and linewidth shows the 1@xmath37 uncertainty in the hyperfine fitting to the spectrum toward the intensity maximum .",

    "the positions of the intensity maxima of the identified cores are illustrated in figures [ fig : figure1 ] , [ fig : figure2 ] , and [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "orion kl is not prominent in n@xmath1h@xmath2 , and is not cataloged as a core .",
    "it is located on the eastern bay of the n@xmath1h@xmath2 emission ridge .",
    "the basic physical parameters of the identified cores are summarized in tables 1 and 2 . the hwhm ( half of fwhm ) core radius @xmath14 is measured as @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is the core area s at the half maximum ) , and then corrected for the telescope beam size .",
    "we fit the spectrum observed toward the intensity maximum by using the hyperfine spectrum model consisting of multiple gaussian components including the effects of optical depth assuming a single excitation temperature .",
    "figures [ fig : figure5 ] , [ fig : figure6 ] , [ fig : figure7 ] , [ fig : figure8 ] , and [ fig : figure9 ] show the examples of the hyperfine fitting .",
    "the procedure is given in @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic relative intensities of the hyperfine components are taken from @xcite .",
    "the free parameters are the excitation temperature @xmath10 , the sum of optical depths of the hyperfine components @xmath40 , systemic velocity ( radial velocity ) , and intrinsic linewidth ( which is corrected for broadening due to line optical depth and instrumental resolution ) .",
    "@xmath32 in the table represents the intensity of the main n@xmath1h@xmath2 @xmath22 component ( @xmath33 , @xmath35 = 2 , 3@xmath41 , 2 ) derived in the hyperfine fitting .",
    "when the fitting is not very successful , we show approximate @xmath32 values by indicating with `` @xmath18 '' .",
    "@xmath40 represents the total optical depth summing up those of the seven hyperfine components of the n@xmath1h@xmath2 emission .",
    "the optical depth of the main n@xmath1h@xmath2 @xmath22 component ( @xmath33 , @xmath35 = 2 , 3@xmath41 , 2 ) is 0.259 @xmath41 @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the details of the column density estimation are given in @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1 column density @xmath42(h@xmath1 ) is derived by assuming the n@xmath1h@xmath2 fractional abundance relative to h@xmath1 is 3.0 @xmath41 10@xmath43 @xcite . the average density @xmath44(h@xmath1 )",
    "is derived as @xmath42(h@xmath1)/ 2 @xmath14 . for the omc-2/3 region ,",
    "we include the existence of molecular outflows and near - infrared h@xmath1 jets ( @xcite and references therein ) as `` o '' and `` h '' , respectively , in table 2 .    the n@xmath1h@xmath2 excitation temperature toward the core intensity peak is @xmath45 k ( average and standard deviation ) .",
    "this value is 1.6 times as high as that in taurus cores ( @xmath46 k for the central nine positions of each core in the taurus cloud , which is good for comparison with orion cores by taking into account that orion is three times more distant , @xcite ) .",
    "the optical depth of the main component ( @xmath33 , @xmath35 = 2 , 3@xmath41 , 2 ) is found to be moderate ( 1.1@xmath110.7 ) for the intensity peak , and this is similar to the situation in taurus cores @xcite .",
    "we summarize the average physical parameters of n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores with standard deviations .",
    "the line width is @xmath12 = 0.92@xmath110.52 km s@xmath13 , core size is @xmath14 = 0.086@xmath110.025 pc , column density is @xmath42(h@xmath1 ) = ( 6.7@xmath112.6)@xmath4110@xmath47 @xmath48 , average density is @xmath44(h@xmath1 ) = ( 1.2@xmath110.4)@xmath4110@xmath49 @xmath50 , and core mass is @xmath15 = 46@xmath1132 @xmath16 .",
    "we derived the virial parameter , which is defined as the virial mass divided by the core mass , to be 0.39@xmath110.32 .",
    "one possibility is that the actual n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance is higher than the value we assumed .",
    "however , the mass estimation usually accompanies uncertainty by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "furthermore , it seems that the n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance varies over the @xmath0-shaped filament ( see discussion later ) .",
    "therefore , it would be hard to derive a precise value of n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance on the basis of simple analysis assuming virial equilibrium .",
    "when we compare orion n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores with taurus n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores @xcite , orion cores have 2.6 , 3.2 , 4.0 and 32 times larger core size , linewidth , h@xmath1 column density , and core mass than taurus cores , respectively . the h@xmath1 column density in taurus used here",
    "is an average for central nine positions taking into account the difference in distance .",
    "figures [ fig : figure10 ] and [ fig : figure11 ] show a comparison between n@xmath1h@xmath2 ( present study ) and h@xmath9co@xmath2 @xcite in a closer view of the omc-2/3 region .",
    "basically , the distribution of these tracers is similar .",
    "close inspection lets us see some differences .",
    "first , the h@xmath9 co@xmath2 core ac9 is not prominent in n@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "second , n@xmath1h@xmath2 core 4 does not have a tail toward the south , which is seen in the h@xmath9 co@xmath2 and in the dust continuum ( figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "third , n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores 10 and 12 are more prominent in n@xmath1h@xmath2 than h@xmath9 co@xmath2 counterparts .",
    "next , we investigate the variation of the core properties along the `` @xmath0-shaped filament . ''",
    "figure [ fig : figure12 ] plots the n@xmath1h@xmath2 linewidth against the declination . by using the intrinsic n@xmath1h@xmath2 linewidth",
    ", we investigate the velocity dispersion of the quiescent gas along the `` @xmath0-shaped filament . '' over the orion nebula region , the linewidth is large ( 1.1@xmath172.1 km s@xmath13 ) . in the omc-2/3 region , it becomes moderate ( 0.5@xmath171.3 km s@xmath13 ) , and it is smaller ( 0.3@xmath171.1 km s@xmath13 ) in the south of the orion nebula .",
    "it is important that we observe the tendency in n@xmath1h@xmath2 , which is the molecule least affected from star formation activities such as outflows @xcite .",
    "it was suggeted that larger linewidths of the quiescent gas to form stars will lead to higher mass accretion rate onto protostars and eventually to more massive stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an argument against this idea is that larger linewidths might be a result of more massive star formation .",
    "the present study shows a trend in linewidth of the quiescent gas , and might suggest that variation in linewidth could serve as difference in the initial condition for on - going star formation in the orion cloud .",
    "the core radius does not show any prominent trend against the declination ( figure not shown ) .",
    "figure [ fig : figure13 ] shows the temperature variation along the `` @xmath0-shaped filament . ''",
    "the kinetic temperature from co @xmath3 = 3@xmath42 seems to trace the outer , warmer , less - dense layer of the cloud externally heated ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the nh@xmath5 rotation temperature is about 20 k over the filament , implying that the gas temperature of the quiescent dense gas is rather constant .",
    "the average and standard deviation of the nh@xmath5 rotation temperature are 21.6 and 5.3 k , respectively .",
    "a rotation temperature of @xmath18 20 k corresponds to a gas kinetic temperature of @xmath18 20 k @xcite .",
    "figure 3 of @xcite shows a clear variation in rotation temperature .",
    "however , at positions coincident with quiescent cloud cores identified in n@xmath1h@xmath2 and cs , this variation is not seen .",
    "it is very interesting that the quiescent orion cores show constant kinetic temperatures while their linewidth varies along the filament .",
    "the kinetic temperature in quiescent orion cores are twice as high as that in dark cloud cores ( 8 - 10 k , see , e.g. , @xcite ) the n@xmath1h@xmath2 excitation temperature decreases toward the south slightly , which means that the core density or n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance decreases toward the south .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the orion a cloud has the average density decrease toward the south . in detail , the excitation temperature seems to have its peak around omc-2 .",
    "h@xmath9co@xmath2 in the orion a cloud was observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distribution in these maps is consistent in the omc-2/3 region , which was covered by both studies .",
    "@xcite used automated software to identify cores , while @xcite identified cores through visual inspection .",
    "the former identified two times as many cores as @xcite in the omc-2/3 region .",
    "part of this difference might be due to different sensitivities , but we suspect that different core identification methods are the main reason for disparate core numbers . for comparison , we use @xcite , which identified cores through visual inspection , for consistency .",
    "the cross identification is given in table 2 .",
    "the column `` aso '' lists h@xmath9 co@xmath2 cores in @xcite , and column `` paper i '' lists cs @xmath3 = 1@xmath40 cores in @xcite .    using the cores identified in both n@xmath1h@xmath2 and h@xmath9co@xmath2",
    ", we compare the n@xmath1h@xmath2 and h@xmath9co@xmath2 cores in the omc-2/3 region ( figures [ fig : figure14 ] , [ fig : figure15 ] , and [ fig : figure16 ] ) .",
    "the n@xmath1h@xmath2 linewidth tends to narrower than the h@xmath9co@xmath2 linewidth , which is consistent with the fact that n@xmath1h@xmath2 traces the quiescent molecular gas .",
    "the core radius and core mass are rather consistent between these two lines , and it is likely that these two molecular lines trace similar density regions , although the linewidth is different to some extent .",
    "on the other hand , only eight cores out of 14 n@xmath1h@xmath2 ( cores 1 through 14 ) in the omc-2/3 region have h@xmath9co@xmath2 counterparts .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores 10 and 12 are more prominent in n@xmath1h@xmath2 than h@xmath9 co@xmath2 counterparts in omc-2 .",
    "@xcite showed that , in a region containing orion kl and omc-2 ( see their figure 4 ) , nh@xmath5 tends to be stronger in the north ( omc-2 ) while cs tends to be stronger in the south .",
    "@xcite studied molecular distribution around orion kl ( from 6@xmath19 south to 6@xmath19 north ) , and found that n@xmath1h@xmath2 tends to be stronger in the north , h@xmath9 co@xmath2 shows similar trend but less prominent , and other molecules show different trends ( peaked around orion kl or flat ) .",
    "figure [ fig : figure17 ] shows the antenna temperature of n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores ( present study ) and h@xmath9co@xmath2 cores @xcite against the declination .",
    "the dashed and solid lines delineate the rough upper boundary of the antenna temperature of n@xmath1h@xmath2 and h@xmath9co@xmath2 , respectively , by connecting local maxima to guide the reader s eye for the global trend .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 is intense in omc-2 ( n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores 10 and 12 ) with respect to the h@xmath9co@xmath2 intensity variation .",
    "figure [ fig : figure18 ] shows the antenna temperature of n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores ( present study ) and cs cores @xcite against the declination .",
    "again , n@xmath1h@xmath2 is relatively intense in omc-2 ( n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores 10 and 12 ) with respect to the cs intensity variation .",
    "the n - bearing molecules , n@xmath1h@xmath2 and nh@xmath5 seem to be more intense in omc-2 ( n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores 10 and 12 ) , compared with the h@xmath9co@xmath2 and cs distribution .",
    "the gas kinetic temperature of quiescent cores is rather constant judging from the nh@xmath5 rotation temperature .",
    "this suggests that omc-2 has higher abundance of n - bearing molecules or higher filling factor of the quiescent gas .",
    "although omc-2 is known as active star cluster forming region @xcite , it seems that it still has a large reservoir of quiescent gas available for future star formation .",
    "note that n - bearing molecules , n@xmath1h@xmath2 and nh@xmath5 are late - type molecules .",
    "@xcite showed that omc-3 has class 0 protostars ( candidates ) and suggested evolutionary trend from north ( omc-3 , younger ) to south ( omc-2 , older ) .",
    "this trend is consistent with the trend in the chemical properties ( n - bearing late - type molecules are more abundant in omc-2 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : figure19 ] compares the n@xmath1h@xmath2 with hc@xmath5n distribution in the omc-2/3 .",
    "globally , their distribution is quite similar , although they are known to be late - type and early - type molecules in dark cloud chemistry , respectively @xcite .",
    "both are intense in omc-2 .",
    "this is in contrast with the fact that omc-2 is not very prominent compared with omc-3 in h@xmath9co@xmath2 .",
    "omc-2 is known as a cluster forming region @xcite .",
    "although hc@xmath5n is known to be a tracer of early chemical evolutionary stage in dark clouds @xcite , it is not always so .",
    "@xcite shows that the hc@xmath5n @xmath3 = 10@xmath49 and 12@xmath411 emission are peaked at orion kl very clearly , although it shows prominent star formation already .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : figure4 ] shows that n@xmath1h@xmath2 is rather weak near orion kl , suggesting that very high temperature due to star formation activity destroys this molecule due to co evaporation from the dust .",
    "the hc@xmath5n linewidth around n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores 9 and 10 in omc-2 is @xmath18 1.2 km s@xmath13 and similar to or only slightly larger than the n@xmath1h@xmath2 linewidth .",
    "hc@xmath5n seems to be abundant in dense , quiescent gas , even with prominent star formation activities .",
    "we found the displacement between n@xmath1h@xmath2 and hc@xmath5n in omc-3 ( figure [ fig : figure20 ] ) .",
    "hc@xmath5n shows two emission peaks on both sides of n@xmath1h@xmath2 core 4 .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 core 4 is associated with two x - ray protostar candidates tkh8 and tkh10 @xcite ( figure [ fig : figure21 ] ) . figure [ fig : figure22 ] shows hc@xmath5n stamp map ( profile map ) near tkh8 and tkh10 .",
    "@xcite concluded that one of the x - ray emitting protostars , tkh8 , is a class i protostar emitting the x - ray emission from the protostellar jet .",
    "a possibility is that the displacement represents the chemical evolution .",

    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 cores 4 , 5 , and 6 have an n@xmath1h@xmath2 excitation temperature of @xmath10 = 9.3 , 7.5 , and 6.6 k , respectively .",
    "the dust spectral index is rather constant in the omc-2/3 region except for mms6 @xcite , and the omc-2/3 region has no dust temperature variation except for mms6 . because there is no evidence that n@xmath1h@xmath2 core 4 has lower temperature in omc-3 , it is not easy to explain the displacement between hc@xmath5n and n@xmath1h@xmath2 in terms of different degrees of depletion .",
    "@xcite showed that the class i x - ray protostar tkh8 has near - infrared h@xmath1 jets toward the west , although this jet is very small in size .",
    "@xcite showed larger - scale co outflows in this region .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath2 is known to trace the quiescent gas , and will be suppressed in outflow affected gas .",
    "the displacement between hc@xmath5n and n@xmath1h@xmath2 peaks observed in omc-3 could represent the chemical evolution or the effect of molecular outflow from protostars .",
