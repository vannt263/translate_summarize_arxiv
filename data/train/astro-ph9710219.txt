    "the detection of feii and mgii absorption lines at a redshift of @xmath2 in the optical spectrum of gb970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , provided the first confirmation that @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) originate at cosmological distances .",
    "most of the qualitative properties of cosmological grbs are explained by the fireball model ( see e.g. , goodman 1986 ; paczyski 1986 ; mszros & rees 1993 [ mr ] ) . in this model ,",
    "a compact ( @xmath3 cm ) source releases an energy of @xmath4 erg over a duration @xmath5 seconds with a negligible baryonic contamination ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "unsteady activity of the source results in a wind composed of many thin layers ( fireball shells ) of varying energy and baryonic mass . within each shell",
    "the high energy - density at the source results in an optically thick @xmath1-pair plasma that expands and accelerates to relativistic speeds .",
    "after an initial acceleration phase , the radiation and thermal energy of the fireball plasma is converted into the kinetic energy associated with the radial motion of the protons .",
    "collisions between the shells can convert part of that kinetic energy into radiation and yield the primary grb via synchrotron emission and inverse - compton scattering ( paczyski & xu 1994 ; rees & mszros 1994 [ rm ] ; sari & piran 1997 [ sp ] ) .",
    "as the wind continues to expand , it impinges on the surrounding medium and eventually drives a relativistic blastwave in it , which heats fresh gas and accelerates electrons to relativistic speeds , thus producing the delayed afterglow radiation observed on time scales of hours to months ( van paradijs et al .",

    "the primary grb emission is more likely caused by internal shocks than the external shocks ( mr ) , since they can occur closer to the source and thus account for the rapid variability observed in many bursts ( rm ; sp ) .",
    "unsteady activity of the central source naturally results in faster shells overtaking slower ones in front of them , and hence in energy dissipation by internal shocks .",
    "the complex temporal structure observed in grbs then reflects the activity - history of their sources ( sp ; kobayashi , piran , & sari 1997 [ kps ] ) .    it is often assumed that behind internal shocks , electrons are fermi accelerated with a near equipartition energy density and magnetic fields acquire nearly equipartition strength .",
    "the electrons cool by synchrotron emission and inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering off the synchrotron photons . under typical conditions ,",
    "the time scale for ic scattering is shorter than the synchrotron cooling time .",
    "multiple scattering of the photons boosts a significant fraction of the radiation energy to frequencies above the @xmath1-pair creation threshold .",
    "the pairs produced in this process are also relativistic and cool rapidly by ic scattering . since the annihilation time of these pairs is longer than the hydrodynamic time in the comoving frame ,",
    "they survive in the wind for a long time .",
    "although the creation of pairs and their subsequent cooling is likely to leave noticeable imprints on the emergent radiation spectrum , it has not been analyzed before in the grb literature .",
    "since the photon and electron densities decline rapidly with radius , the strength of these signatures can serve as a probe of the radius at which the internal shocks occur .",
    "the grb spectrum should also depend on the level of baryonic contamination in the wind .",
    "the extreme limit of pure energy release with no baryons was ruled out in the past based on the prediction that a point explosion of this type would lead to a roughly thermal spectrum ( goodman 1986 ) .",
    "one can place a lower limit on the baryonic mass in the fireball shells by requiring that internal shocks should occur before an external shock does ( this limit depends on the ambient medium density ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an upper limit can be placed based on the variability time scale of the source and the condition that the shells be optically thin at the radius where internal shocks occur .    in this _",
    "letter _ we study in detail the emergent spectra from the collision of two fireball shells .",
    "in particular , we quantify the significance of the radiation processes which were previously ignored in the literature , such as multiple compton scattering , @xmath7 creation , and their subsequent cooling .",
    "we use the collision kernels , reaction rates , and the computational techniques given in pilla & shaham ( 1997 [ ps ] ) .",
    "more details about this calculation and an elaborate study of the spectral characteristics of relativistic shocks will be included in a subsequent publication ( pilla & loeb 1997 ) . in ",
    "2 we describe our model and specify the physical conditions in the emission region . in ",
    "3 we outline the relevant radiation processes and compute the model spectra . finally ,  4 summarizes the main implications of this work .",
    "the typical fireball dynamics ( piran , shemi , & narayan 1993 , [ psn ] ; mszros , laguna , & rees 1993 ; sari , narayan , & piran 1996 [ snp ] ; sp ; and kps ) can be illustrated by considering a single shell of total energy @xmath8 erg , rest mass @xmath9 g , and initial radius @xmath10 cm .",
    "after a brief acceleration phase , the lorentz factor of the shell reaches a constant value @xmath11 at an observer - frame radius @xmath12 ( the protons are taken to be non - relativistic in the comoving frame , before the collision of shells ) .",
    "the energy of the shell is predominantly kinetic beyond this stage . outside the radius @xmath13 ( all radii in the present analysis",
    "are measured in the observer s frame ) , the comoving width of the shell increases linearly with radius ( psn ) .",
    "the comoving proton density scales as @xmath14 for shell radii @xmath15 and as @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the thomson optical depth of the shell is @xmath18 for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 cm is the radius at which the shell becomes optically thin to thomson scattering by its own electrons . here",
    "@xmath21 is thomson cross section and @xmath22 is the proton rest mass . for @xmath17 , the comoving width of the shell",
    "is @xmath23 .",
    "two photons which are emitted with a proper - time difference @xmath24 , reach the observer with a time separation @xmath25 ( sp ) . assuming that the radiative cooling time is much shorter than the light transit time through the system",
    ", one finds that the observed width of the radiation pulse @xmath26 and the radius of the emission region @xmath27 are related through @xmath28 , which in turn can be used to constrain the values of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 from observations .",
    "the emission spectrum will be nonthermal only if @xmath31 .",
    "now consider a wind of total duration @xmath32 , composed of many thin fireball shells of thickness @xmath33 ( @xmath34 may change from one shell to another ) .",
    "we assume that for @xmath17 there are regions in the wind where slower shells precede the faster ones , i.e. @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the local lorentz factor .",
    "the spatial extent of the wind is typically @xmath37 ( in fact , @xmath38 also holds in general ) .",
    "it was shown by waxman & piran ( 1994 ) that under these conditions the wind layers are susceptible to rayleigh - taylor instability because a rarefied fluid shell is pushing against a denser one .",
    "the resulting turbulent mixing will complicate the shock structure and deform it away from a simple planar geometry .",
    "merging of a rarefied shell with a denser one might therefore be accompanied by the formation of `` fingers '' perpendicular to the shell walls , similar to the non - relativistic shock structure in supernova remnants ( e.g. , jun & norman 1996 ) .",
    "the combined shells would then break into bubbles of different sizes , and the energy dissipation would take place near the bubble walls , due to collisions among them or instabilities on their surfaces ( kamionkowski & freese 1992 ) .    by assuming that the shells as well as the shock fronts remain planar , kps had found that the dissipation efficiency of internal shocks might obtain high values @xmath39 for reasonable wind parameters .",
    "we assume that similar efficiencies are achieved in the case of unstable mixing .",
    "since the combined area of the bubble walls greatly exceeds that of a planar shock , the electron acceleration efficiency in the present case is likely to be higher .",
    "however the temporal and spectral characteristics of the bursts might be different in the two cases . for a planar shock",
    "the accelerated electrons populate a thin layer around the shock front since their cooling time is much shorter than the transit time of sound waves across the shells .",
    "however , in the unstable mixing case we assume , to a first approximation , that the energy dissipation takes place nearly uniformly and simultaneously throughout the entire volume of the emission region . for the purpose of estimating the physical conditions involved , we take @xmath40 erg , @xmath41 g , @xmath42 cm , and a bulk lorentz factor of the emission region of @xmath43 .",
    "these values yield @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 , a comoving width of the post - shock shell @xmath47 cm , and an average lorentz factor of the protons in the comoving frame ( i.e. , after shock heating ) of @xmath48 .",
    "acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies and the presence of strong magnetic fields are essential for converting the energy dissipated by the shock waves into radiation .",
    "since the physics of neither of these processes is well understood , we parameterize the corresponding energy densities in units of their equipartition values . a magnetic equipartition parameter @xmath49 , corresponds to a field strength @xmath50^{1/2}10^{4}$ ] g , where @xmath51 ( all quantities are comoving , unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "we assume that the electrons are accelerated throughout the emission region .",
    "the amount of energy transferred from protons to electrons is uncertain , and we define the acceleration efficiency @xmath52 in such a way that the average lorentz factor of the electrons immediately after they are heated ( via fermi - type acceleration ) is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electron rest mass . because the coulomb collision time @xmath55 , we can safely ignore collisional relaxation in our analysis ( here @xmath56 is the coulomb logarithm ) .",
    "collisionless acceleration of electrons can be efficient if they are tightly coupled to the protons and the magnetic field by means of plasma waves ( kirk 1994 ) .",
    "the typical alfvn speed in the plasma is @xmath57 . the larmor radius of an electron with a lorentz factor @xmath0 is @xmath58 cm , and that of a proton of equal lorentz factor , @xmath59 , is larger by a factor @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding acceleration time scales ( e.g. , hillas 1984 ) are , @xmath61 sec and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "synchrotron losses limit the maximum value of the electron lorentz factor to @xmath63 .",
    "the minimum value is determined by @xmath64 and the shape of the electron distribution .",
    "we assume that the fraction of electrons per unit lorentz factor @xmath0 has the form @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the average lorentz factor at any given time .",
    "the energy density in electrons immediately after their acceleration is @xmath69 . in our model",
    "the radiation time scale is much shorter than the hydrodynamic expansion time scale in the comoving frame ( which leads to a radiative efficiency of nearly @xmath70 ) and the radiation density at the end of electron cooling is therefore @xmath71 .",
    "we compute the spectra for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "we assume that the radiation energy density is initially small , and hence the electrons start losing their energy via synchrotron emission . as the energy density of the emitted radiation builds up , cooling via ic scattering becomes important as well .",
    "the typical time scale for synchrotron or ic losses is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 in the synchrotron case and @xmath77 in the ic case . here",
    "@xmath78 is the radiation energy density and @xmath79 is a dimensionless constant of order unity . for typical grb conditions @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the light transit time through the system .",
    "therefore electron cooling takes place only locally .",
    "we assume that the acceleration proceeds throughout the cooling phase in such a way that it maintains a steady power - law distribution with a constant index @xmath82 , while @xmath68 declines due to radiative losses . if @xmath83 , the synchrotron cooling time is long and multiple ic scatterings become important .",
    "each scattering in the thomson regime increases the photon energy by a factor @xmath84 ( loeb , mckee , & lahav 1991 ) , so that some of the photons are eventually boosted into the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime .",
    "as @xmath68 decreases , the up - scattered part of the spectrum spreads over many decades in frequency .",
    "the electron energy density @xmath85 changes at a rate = ( ) _ sy+ ( ) _ ic , [ energy - rate ] where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the average value of @xmath90 over the initial electron distribution .",
    "the ic cooling rate , @xmath91 , is derived below .",
    "the characteristic cooling time @xmath92 is a few times @xmath93 under typical conditions .",
    "if @xmath94 is the instantaneous energy density of radiation , then energy conservation implies @xmath95 ( which is constant ) , and by assumption @xmath96 .",
    "the instantaneous radiation spectrum can be characterized by @xmath97 so that @xmath98 is the fraction of the radiation energy density within an interval @xmath99 around @xmath100 ; here @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the photon frequency , and @xmath103 is planck s constant .    the spectral evolution rate ( see pilla & loeb 1997 ) is derived from the equation u_(t)(,t)- ( , t)=_sy+ _ ic , [ spec - rate ] where we have used the fact that @xmath104 .",

    "similar cascades of pair creation and cooling occur in active galactic nuclei ( svensson 1987 ) . throughout the pair cascade and cooling process",
    "the radiation spectrum evolves continuously but its total energy density remains nearly constant at a value close to @xmath71 .",
    "figure 1b shows an example of this evolution up to a time @xmath135 .",
    "because the hydrodynamic time scale in the comoving frame @xmath136 , pair processes can not continue to operate for times much longer than @xmath137 because of the decline in the densities due to the expansion of the fireball .",

    "we find that after a time @xmath151 , only @xmath152 of the initial energy remains with the electrons .",
    "figure 1a illustrates that as a result of electron cooling , the location of the synchrotron peak shifts to lower energies and also becomes broader .",
    "later on , another peak develops at a much higher energy due to ic losses , with kn suppression in the very high - energy tail .",

    "<S> the generic spectral signature from pair creation and multiple compton scattering is highly sensitive to the radius at which the shock dissipation takes place and to the lorentz factor of the wind . </S>",
    "<S> the entire emission spectrum extends over a wide range of photon energies , from the optical regime up to tev energies . for reasonable values of the wind parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spectrum is found to be in good agreement with the burst spectra observed by batse .    </S>",
