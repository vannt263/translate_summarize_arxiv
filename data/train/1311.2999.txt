    "understanding how radio emission originates and evolves in extragalactic radio sources is one of the greatest challenges faced by modern astrophysics .",
    "+ in the evolutionary scenario , the size of a radio source is strictly related to its age . given their intrinsically compact sizes , usually smaller than the host galaxy , the population of compact steep spectrum ( css ) and gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio sources were proposed as the progenitors of the classical radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed their radio structure is usually a scaled - down version of the fanaroff - riley type - ii galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is mostly accepted that , at least the two - sided ( or symmetric ) objects of this class , represent the young stage in the radio source evolution .",
    "depending on their linear size they are termed as compact symmetric objects ( cso ) or medium symmetric objects ( mso ) if they are smaller or larger than 1 kpc , respectively @xcite , although for a strict application of the definition the core must be detected .",
    "+ the genuine youth of these objects is strongly supported by the determination of the kinematic and radiative ages in about twenty of the most compact css / gps objects , which were found to be a few thousand years or less ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "+ the determination of the physical properties in objects which are at the beginning of their evolution is crucial for setting tight constraints on the initial conditions of the radio emission . to this aim",
    "the selection of radio sources in the very first stages of the radio emission is necessary .",
    "following the empirical anti - correlation between the spectral peak frequency and the source size ( i.e. the source age ) found by @xcite , the youngest objects should be sought among high frequency peaking ( hfp ) radio sources .",
    "a sample of young hfp candidates was selected by @xcite on the basis of their inverted spectrum between 1.4 and 5 ghz .",
    "the contamination from variable , boosted objects was removed on the basis of their variability , morphology and polarization properties @xcite .",
    "the sample of genuine young hfp candidates is reported in @xcite . a crucial requirement for unambiguously classifying a source as a genuinely young radio source is the detection of the core component . among the sources in the sample of young hfp candidates",
    "@xcite , the core has been detected in three objects : j0111 + 3906 , j0650 + 6001 , and j1511 + 0518 .",
    "studies of the proper motion in j0111 + 3906 @xcite , j0650 + 6001 @xcite , and in j1511 + 0518 @xcite estimate a kinematic age of a few hundred years , indicating that hfps are at an early stage of their radio evolution / growth .",
    "+ in this paper we present multifrequency vlba observations of an additional four hfp objects with the aim of detecting the core component and determining the physical properties , such as the peak frequency , the magnetic field and the luminosity , which are important for constraining the evolutionary models .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations and the data reduction ; section 3 presents the description of the target sources and the results from the spectral analysis ; discussion and summary are presented in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "an appendix with very large array ( vla ) flux densities of sources from the bright hfp sample is provided .",
    "+ throughout this paper , we assume @xmath0 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , in a flat universe . the spectral index is defined as @xmath4(@xmath5 ) @xmath6 . +",
    "vlba observations of the four hfp sources j0037 + 0808 , j1335 + 5844 , j1735 + 5049 , and j2203 + 1007 from the bright hfp sample @xcite were performed in full polarization with a recording band width of 32 mhz at 256 mbps in l band ( 1.4 and 1.6 ghz ) , s band ( 2.2 ghz ) , c band ( 4.6 and 5.0 ) , x band ( 8.1 and 8.4 ghz ) , and u band ( 15 ghz ) .",
    "the sources j1335 + 5844 and j1735 + 5049 were bright enough to allow detection at high frequency , and observations at 22 ghz ( k band ) were performed for these two sources .",
    "+ observations were carried out between january 2010 and january 2011 in four different runs ( one per source ) , for a total observing time of 36 hours . in each observing run , the target source was observed interleaved with its calibrator , in order to optimize the uv - coverage , and cycling through frequencies .",
    "this allows us to consider the observations at the various frequencies almost simultaneous . in l , c , and x bands ,",
    "the intermediate frequencies are separated by about 300 mhz in order to improve the frequency coverage of the source spectra .",
    "+ the correlation was performed at the vlba correlator in socorro and the data reduction was carried out with the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( ` aips ` ) package .",
    "after the application of system temperature and antenna gain information , the amplitudes were checked by using the data of the fringe finders da195 ( j0555 + 3948 ) , 4c39.25 ( j0927 + 3902 ) , 3c345 ( j1642 + 3948 ) , and 3c454.3 ( j2253 + 1608 ) .",
    "all the gain corrections were found to be within 5% in l , c , and x bands , 7% in s and u bands , and 10% in k band , which can be conservatively assumed as the absolute calibration error ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the sources were strong enough to allow fringe fitting .",
    "final images were produced after a number of phase self - calibration iterations . at the end of the self - calibration iteration we applied the amplitude calibration to remove residual systematic errors .",
    "+ the final rms noises ( 1@xmath8 ) are generally between 0.08 and 0.5 mjy / beam , being worst at the highest frequency .          the spectra obtained by the simultaneous multifrequency observations where fitted using the function discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "the peak frequency and peak flux density are reported in table [ vla - flux ] .",
    "+ to investigate the presence of some variability , we compare the flux densities with those measured in previous epochs and reported in @xcite . following @xcite we computed the variability index @xmath9 defined as :      where @xmath11 is the flux density at the @xmath12th frequency measured at one epoch , @xmath13 is the mean value of the flux density computed by averaging the flux density at the @xmath12th frequency measured at all the available epochs , @xmath14 is the root mean square ( rms ) on @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the number of sampled frequencies .",
    "we prefer to compute the variability index for each epoch instead of considering all the epochs together in order to potentially detect small outbursts .",
    "+ significant variability is found in the sources j0625 + 4440 and j2136 + 0041 , which were already classified as blazars and removed from the sample @xcite .",
    "the sources still considered young radio source candidates do not show significant variability ."
