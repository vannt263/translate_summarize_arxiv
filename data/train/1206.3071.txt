    "the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect has been one of the most intriguing research field in condensed matter physics during the past few decades , in both theory and experiment.@xcite recently the fqh effect attracts much attentions due to new developments including the observation in graphene,@xcite flat band chern insulators @xcite , rapidly rotating bosons,@xcite applications to topological quantum computing,@xcite and so on .",
