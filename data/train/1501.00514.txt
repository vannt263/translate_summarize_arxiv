    "we will see that the structure of the @xmath4 theory is much richer and more elaborate than that of conventional @xmath6 theory and also of the cubic theories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",

    "the partition function for this theory is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "we analyze this theory using the method of steepest descents .",
    "there is a critical value of @xmath11 : for @xmath12 all three saddle points are real , while for @xmath13 one saddle point is real and the other two form a complex - conjugate pair . in both cases",
    "semiclassical approximations to the partition function and the corresponding green s functions are obtained . because @xmath1 , the one - point green s function vanishes even when @xmath13 .",

    "[ s3 ] the corresponding analysis is performed for the @xmath0-symmetric theory in which @xmath15 and @xmath8 are replaced by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "again , we find a critical value of @xmath11 . for @xmath12 , one of the three saddle points",
    "is purely imaginary and the other two are @xmath0-conjugate . for @xmath13",
    "all three saddle points lie on the imaginary-@xmath18 axis . when @xmath12 , new and surprising features appear .",
    "we find that for @xmath19 only one saddle point contributes to @xmath20 $ ] , while for @xmath21 all three saddle points contribute . as a consequence ,",
    "the partition function @xmath20 $ ] for @xmath19 differs from the partition function for @xmath21 and the green s functions obtained by taking the limit @xmath2 differ from those obtained in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-symmetric quartic theory evades the properties of the bogoliubov limit for the construction of the green s functions .",

    "however , unlike the conventional quartic theory , the one - point green s function @xmath23 is nonvanishing even though @xmath5 ; the green s function has a purely imaginary value .",
    "the nonvanishing of @xmath23 contradicts the mermin - wagner - coleman ( mwc ) theorem on the absence of symmetry breaking in @xmath1 dimensions @xcite .",

    "in this section we review the ordinary @xmath6 theory in @xmath5 dimensions so that we can compare it later with the corresponding @xmath0-symmetric theory .",

    "we calculate the partition - function integral in the semiclassical approximation for which @xmath29 is small .",
    "to do so we use the method of steepest descents @xcite .",
    "we then identify the green s functions as coefficients of powers of @xmath8 in the expansion of the partition function @xmath20 $ ] .    in order to evaluate the integral in ( [ e1 ] ) asymptotically in the limit @xmath30 , we consider the equation that determines the location of the saddle points : @xmath31 when solving ( [ e3 ] ) , we note that two different situations arise depending on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "specifically , by defining the critical value @xmath32 , we see that the qualitative behavior of the three solutions of ( [ e3 ] ) depends on @xmath11 being larger or smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "we begin by considering the case @xmath12 .      for @xmath12",

    "as is well known , when @xmath1 there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking because there is tunneling between the two minima @xmath35 and @xmath52 of the potential @xcite . in our case ( @xmath5 )",

    "moreover , @xmath61 does not have the usual perturbative behavior @xmath63 .",
    "this is because there are contributions from two saddle points , which give a typical nonperturbative result @xcite .",
    "let us compare the above result with the hypothetical @xmath64 case for which the volume factor suppresses the tunneling ( and so there is symmetry breaking ) .",
    "under this supposition we would consider contributions from only one of the two vacua , @xmath35 or @xmath52 .",

    ", the squared mass of the fluctuation above the vacuum is @xmath221 , as in the conventional theory .",
    "in contrast , @xmath23 is nonvanishing .",
    "evidently , the @xmath0-symmetric theory evades the mwc theorem @xcite ( according to which there can not be spontaneous symmetry breaking below @xmath222 dimensions ) .",
    "we have studied the zero - dimensional euclidean @xmath0-symmetric @xmath6 theory in the presence of an external source @xmath8 and have compared it with the corresponding conventional @xmath6 theory .",
    "we calculated the partition function and the green s functions using the saddle - point approximation . as is the case for the conventional theory ,",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric theory possess distinct phases depending on whether the squared mass @xmath11 is greater than or less than the critical value @xmath223 .",
    "these phases are characterized by different green s functions .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath12 , the @xmath0-symmetric theory exhibits two distinct subphases depending on whether @xmath3 or @xmath2 .",
    "the subphases can be described as follows : for @xmath12 and for @xmath19 , the partition function and the green s functions of the @xmath0-symmetric theory can be obtained from the corresponding functions of the conventional theory by analytic continuation to imaginary values of the external source @xmath8 ( @xmath224 ) and to negative values of the coupling @xmath15 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "this connection between the two theories arises because in both cases the partition function receives contributions from one saddle point only ; the saddle point of the @xmath0-symmetric theory can be obtained from the saddle point of the conventional theory by an anticlockwise rotation of @xmath225 in the complex-@xmath18 plane . on the other hand , for @xmath12 and @xmath21 , while the partition function of the conventional theory is still dominated by the perturbative saddle point , the partition function of the @xmath0-symmetric theory receives contributions from the rotated perturbative saddle point and _ also from two nonperturbative saddle points_. this subphase behavior of the @xmath0-symmetric theory is a new and unexpected feature .",
    "the green s functions obtained by performing the two limits @xmath3 and @xmath2 are different , and this is a clear violation of the usual bogoliubov calculation of the green s functions .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric theory differs from the conventional theory in other respects .",
    "in addition to the behavior of the @xmath12 phase , new phenomena appear in the @xmath13 phase . spontaneous symmetry breaking in the conventional quartic theory is forbidden for @xmath1 due to tunneling between the degenerate minima ; this absence of symmetry breaking is due to the mwc theorem @xcite .",
    "the mwc theorem certainly holds for @xmath5 and it implies that for the conventional theory the one - point green s function @xmath60 vanishes even when @xmath13 . in the context of the saddle - point approximation ,",
    "the vanishing of @xmath60 is due to the cancellation of contributions to the partition function coming from the two nonperturbative saddle points .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-symmetric theory evades the mwc theorem in much the same way that supersymmetry evades the coleman - mandula theorem , namely , by circumventing the assumptions needed to prove it .",
    "however , for the @xmath0-symmetric quartic theory the dominant contribution to @xmath20 $ ] comes from just one saddle point .",
    "thus , the @xmath13 phase of the @xmath0-symmetric theory is characterized by a nonvanishing @xmath23 when @xmath5 .",
    "hence , we would expect that even when @xmath226 , in the @xmath0-symmetric @xmath6 theory a phase transition will occur that is not triggered by the usual spontaneous - symmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "moreover , we have demonstrated the surprising result that while @xmath227 in the conventional theory , @xmath228 when @xmath12 in the @xmath0-symmetric theory .",
    "let us make a further comparison between the conventional and the @xmath0-symmetric quartic theories .",
    "we have seen that when @xmath12 and @xmath21 , the partition function of the @xmath0-symmetric theory is not an analytic continuation of the corresponding partition function of the conventional theory .",
    "this is because the @xmath0-symmetric @xmath20 $ ] receives contributions from three saddle points , while only one saddle point contributes to the partition function of the conventional theory . in the @xmath13 case ,",
    "the situation is similar although the roles of the ordinary and the @xmath0-symmetric theories are exchanged .",
    "the partition function of the conventional theory receives contributions from two saddle points , while @xmath20 $ ] of the corresponding @xmath0-symmetric theory gets contributions from only the one saddle point @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "we stress that a cancellation leading to @xmath227 occurs when there are two saddle points , but this is impossible when there is only one saddle point .",
    "we have pointed out in sec .  [",
    "s2 ] in our discussion of the conventional theory that we can artificially induce spontaneous symmetry breaking by discarding the contribution to @xmath20 $ ] from @xmath35 . for @xmath1",
    "this procedure is artificial because both the left and right saddle points contribute to @xmath20 $ ] so the theory can not exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "of course , one of the two saddle points must be discarded only when @xmath64 .",
    "we have entertained this possibility for the @xmath5 conventional theory in sec .  [",
    "s2 ] only to compare the green s functions in ( [ e35 ] ) with the analytic continuation ( a rotation in the complex-@xmath18 plane ) of the green s functions in ( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ e9 ] ) .    to conclude , the structure of the quartic @xmath0-symmetric theory in zero dimensions is much richer than that of conventional quartic theory .",
    "it is also far more elaborate than that of the cubic @xmath7 theory @xcite .",
    "our immediate objective now is to extend the results for the @xmath0-symmetric quartic theory to the @xmath229 case , just as we did for the cubic theory .      100 for background on @xmath0 symmetry",
