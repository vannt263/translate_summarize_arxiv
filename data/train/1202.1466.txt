    "quantization of the nambu - poisson bracket has been a long - standing problem since y. nambu proposed in 1973 @xcite . the zariski quantization proposed in 1996 by g. dito , m. flato ,",
    "d. sternheimer , and l. takhtajan , is one of the strong candidates for a quantization of the nambu - poisson bracket @xcite .",
    "the zariski quantization consists of two steps .",
    "first , instead of a direct quantization of the original nambu - poisson bracket , they deform spaces on which the nambu - poisson bracket acts in the classical level , and define a new nambu - poisson bracket that has the same nambu - poisson structure as the original one .",
    "the definition of the nambu - poisson structure is to satisfy the leibniz rule , the skew - symmetry , and the fundamental identity , which is a generalization of the jacobi identity .",
    "second , they define a deformation quantization of the new nambu - poisson bracket .",
    "because the zariski quantized nambu - poisson bracket reduces not to the original nambu - poisson bracket but to the new nambu - poisson bracket in the classical limit , the zariski quantization is regarded as different with usual quantizations @xcite .",
    "for this reason , applications for physics have developed little for a long time .    in this paper , we study a relation between the original and the new nambu - poisson brackets and clarify physical meaning of the zariski quantization . in subsection 2.1 , we summarize definitions and mathematical properties of the classical zariski product and spaces @xmath0 on which it acts .",
    "we also define the new nambu - poisson bracket on @xmath0 and show that it possesses the same nambu - poisson structure as the original one , whereas g. dito et al .",
    "defined it on @xmath1 that are small subspaces of @xmath0 .",
    "it is necessary for later discussions to define the zariski quantization not on @xmath1 but on @xmath0 . in subsection 2.2",
    ", we construct a natural metric for @xmath0 in order to apply the zariski quantization for field theories .",
    "we show that the metric is invariant under a gauge transformation generated by the new nambu - poisson bracket , although 3-algebras equipped with invariant metrics are restricted in general . in subsection 2.3",
    ", we deform superstring and supermembrane theories by the classical zariski product , the spaces @xmath0 , and the metric .",
    "this deformation can be applied for any first quantized field theory , even if it does not possess the nambu - poisson structure .",
    "we show that the deformed actions reduce to the actions before the deformation if we restrict their fields to only one - body states .",
    "we also show that the deformed actions possess flat directions .",
    "these results imply that the deformation of first quantized theories by the classical zariski product , the space @xmath0 , and the metric is a many - body deformation . as a corollary",
    ", we find that the new nambu - poisson bracket is the many - body deformation of the original nambu - poisson bracket .    in subsection 3.1 ,",
    "we summarize definitions and mathematical properties of the deformation quantization in the zariski quantization . by performing the deformation quantization of the classical zariski product and @xmath0 ,",
    "we obtain the quantum zariski product and @xmath2 .",
    "we can define the zariski quantized nambu - poisson bracket by the deformation quantization of the many - body deformation of the original nambu - poisson bracket . in subsection 3.2",
    ", we construct a natural metric for @xmath2 .",
    "this metric is invariant under a gauge transformation generated by the zariski quantized nambu - poisson bracket . in subsection 3.3 , we perform the zariski quantization of first quantized field theories and study their general features by using a simple model .",
    "the zariski quantization is applicable to any first quantized field theory , which is not necessary to possess the nambu - poisson structure .",
    "we define theories by path - integrals of zariski quantized actions , which are @xmath3 deformations of classical actions . as a result",
    ", we find that pair creations and annihilations occur among the many bodies that are introduced by the many - body deformation .",
    "therefore , by performing the zariski quantization , which consists of the many - body deformation and the deformation quantization , we obtain second quantized theories from first quantized field theories .",
    "the zariski quantization preserves supersymmetries of first quantized field theories , because the quantum zariski product is abelian , associative and distributive , and admits a commutative derivative satisfying the leibniz rule .",
    "therefore , by performing the zariski quantization of superstring and supermembrane theories , we can obtain second quantized theories of the superstrings and the supermembranes .",
    "in this section , we find that actions representing single body systems become those representing many - body systems , by replacing product and spaces on which it acts , with the classical zariski product and @xmath0 . as a corollary",
    ", we find that the new nambu - poisson bracket defined by using the classical zariski product and @xmath0 , is a many - body deformation of the original nambu - poisson bracket .",
    "in this subsection , we summarize definitions and mathematical properties of the classical zariski product @xcite and spaces @xmath0 on which it acts .",
    "we also define a nambu - poisson bracket deformed by the classical zariski product on @xmath0 , which will be interpreted as many - body spaces later , instead of the small subspaces @xmath1 defined in @xcite .",
    "first , we define elements of linear spaces @xmath0 by @xmath4 where the basis @xmath5 are labeled by polynomials @xmath6 in the valuables @xmath7 , @xmath8 with real coefficients .",
    "@xmath5 satisfies @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a real number .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 are functions over @xmath12-dimensional spaces .",
    "summation is defined naturally as linear spaces .",
    "the classical zariski product @xmath13 is defined on @xmath0 by @xmath14 the classical zariski product is abelian , distributive and associative as follows : @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17    we define derivatives on @xmath0 by derivatives with respect to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "these derivatives are commutative : @xmath20 and the derivatives of the classical zariski product satisfy the leibniz rule : @xmath21 we define a nambu - poisson bracket deformed by the classical zariski product and @xmath0 by @xmath22_{\\bullet } & : = & \\epsilon^{ijk } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^i }",

    "the bracket is skew - symmetric , that is , totally anti - symmetric in all the three entries . by using ( [ classicalabelian ] ) - ( [ classicalleibnitz ] )",
    ", one can easily show that it satisfies the leibniz rule and the fundamental identity ; @xmath24 for any @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the deformed nambu - poisson bracket possesses the same nambu - poisson structure as the original one .      in this subsection",
    ", we construct a natural metric for @xmath0 , in order to apply the classical zariski product and @xmath0 for field theories .",
    "we define a metric for @xmath26 by @xmath27 @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath10 is a real number and @xmath30 is a normalized polynomial , whose monomial of the highest total degree has coefficient 1 .",
    "this metric is invariant under a gauge transformation generated by the @xmath12-dimensional deformed nambu - poisson bracket , @xmath31_{\\bullet } : = \\epsilon^{i_1 i_2 \\cdots i_p } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^{i_1 } } \\bold{x}^1 \\bullet \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^{i_2 } } \\bold{x}^2 \\bullet \\cdots \\bullet \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^{i_p } } \\bold{x}^p$ ] . here",

    "we study ground states and find flat directions , which indicates the deformed theories describe many - body systems .",
    "we can deform any first quantized action @xmath38 into @xmath39 .",
    "the action need not to possess the nambu - poisson structure .",
    "if we restrict @xmath40 into @xmath41 , @xmath39 reduces to @xmath42 because @xmath43 is a non - zero constant .",
    "this implies that each @xmath44 among @xmath45 should be a single body state .",
    "irreducible polynomials can label single particle state whereas reducible polynomials can label bound states .    in order to examine whether @xmath39 represent many - body systems , we study ground states in deformed superstring and supermembrane theories as examples .",
    "the bosonic part of the superstring hamiltonian in a light - cone gauge is given by @xmath46 after the deformation , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 for @xmath50 where @xmath51 are constants .",
    "this means @xmath52 represent flat directions .",
    "one can show that these flat directions are preserved after a deformation quantization that will be defined in the next section .",
    "moreover , the deformed theory preserves the supersymmetry of the superstring theory , because the classical and quantum zariski products are abelian , distributive , and associative , and admit commutative derivatives satisfying the leibniz rule .",
    "thus , quantum corrections to the flat directions should be suppressed .",
    "therefore , this theory possesses a continuous spectrum and describes a many - body system .",
    "the flat directions correspond to positions of many - body superstrings .",

    "@xmath49 for @xmath55 where @xmath51 are constants .",

    "we find that pair creations and annihilations occur among the many bodies that are introduced by the many - body deformation .",

    "we will determine the relation later .",
    "the quantum zariski product @xmath58 is defined by a deformation quantization of the classical zariski product as @xmath59 any polynomial can be decomposed uniquely as @xmath60 , where @xmath10 is a real number and @xmath61 are irreducible normalized polynomials .",

    "@xmath74 is defined by @xmath75 the quantum zariski product is also abelian , distributive and associative as follows .",
    "it is abelian because @xmath76 and @xmath77 it is distributive because @xmath78 associativity is verified as @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and thus @xmath81 derivatives are defined as in the previous section by @xmath82 these derivatives are also commutative : @xmath83 and the derivatives of the quantum zariski product also satisfy the leibniz rule : @xmath84    we define the zariski quantized nambu - poisson bracket by @xmath85_{\\bullet_{\\hbar } } & : = & \\epsilon^{ijk } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^i } \\bold{x}_{\\hbar } \\bullet_{\\hbar } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^j } \\bold{x}_{\\hbar } ' \\bullet_{\\hbar } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^k } \\bold{x}_{\\hbar } '' { \\nonumber \\\\}&= & \\sum_{u_0,v_0,w_0 } \\epsilon^{ijk } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^i } y^0_{u_0}(\\sigma ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^j } y'^0_{v_0}(\\sigma ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma^k } y''^0_{w_0}(\\sigma ) z_{u_0 } \\bullet_{\\hbar } z_{v_0 } \\bullet_{\\hbar } z_{w_0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 . by definition ,",
    "the bracket is skew - symmetric .",
    "one can show that it satisfies the fundamental identity and the leibniz rule as exactly in the same way as in the previous section by using the above properties .",
    "thus , the zariski quantized nambu - poisson bracket , which is a deformation quantization of the many - body deformation of the original nambu - poisson bracket , has the same nambu - poisson structure as the original nambu - poison bracket .",
    "we can show that a quantum zariski product of two elements depends only on @xmath87 in the following way . because @xmath88 and @xmath89 we obtain @xmath90 from ( [ quantumproduct1 ] ) , ( [ quantumproduct2 ] ) , ( [ quantumproduct3 ] ) , and ( [ alpha = hbar^2 ] ) , the statement is proven true .",
    "therefore , we identify @xmath87 as @xmath3 .      in this subsection , we construct a natural metric for @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the metric is invariant under a gauge transformation generated by the zariski quantized nambu - poisson bracket .",

    "the left hand side is @xmath95      in this subsection , we study general features of zariski quantized theories by using a simple model .",
    "we start with a first quantized action , @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents a target coordinate .",
    "if we deform it by the classical zariski product and @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "after the zariski quantization , we obtain @xmath101 we define a theory by a path - integral as @xmath102 ( [ classicalaction ] ) is a classical action of this theory because ( [ classicalaction ] ) dominates in ( [ pathint ] ) in the @xmath103 limit .",
    "we have typical interaction terms in ( [ zariskiquantizedaction ] ) ; @xmath104 in ( [ interactions ] ) , @xmath105 is a classical interaction term , whereas @xmath106 is a quantum correction . because each @xmath107 in the interactions is a base for each one - body state , classical interactions represent 6-body interactions as shown as an example in fig.[classical ] , whereas the quantum correction represents a 4-body interaction .",
    "because the quantum correction is @xmath108 , it should be interpreted to be an one - loop correction as shown in fig.[quantum ] .",

    "@xmath121 is a @xmath130 majorana - weyl fermion satisfying @xmath131 these theories are also expected to be second quantized theories of superstrings and supermembranes .",
    "it is rather easy to study their relations to matrix models and string field theories because ( [ iibaction ] ) and ( [ continuumaction ] ) possess large gauge symmetries , the area and volume preserving diffeomorphism symmetry , respectively , which should correspond to the large gauge symmetries of the matrix models and string field theories .",
    "in this paper , we clarified physical meaning of the zariski quantization .",

    "we discuss the origin of the difference between the physical consequences in the paper by g. dito et al . and in our paper .",
    "in our paper , we deformed the first quantized field theories by @xmath0 , which depend on both @xmath132-spaces and @xmath133-spaces . in @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath134 are labels on many bodies and @xmath135 are their fields . as a result ,",
    "zariski quantized theories are second quantized theories . on the other hand , g. dito et al . studied the zariski quantization on small subspaces @xmath1 , which depend essentially only on @xmath133-spaces since the basis @xmath136 satisfy @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "then , there is no degree of freedom of @xmath135 in @xmath1 .",
    "because one needs to define physical observables by @xmath138 themselves in @xmath1 , zariski quantized theories can not be second quantized theories and the zariski quantization was interpreted as `` sesqui - quantization , '' a halfway between first and second quantizations .",
    "string field theories and several matrix models are known to describe many - body strings or membranes although they have not been proved to formulate non - perturbative string theory yet .",
    "we hope that non - perturbative dynamics of string theory will be derived from the zariski quantized superstring and supermembrane theories .",
