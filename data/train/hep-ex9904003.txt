    "such dibaryon states correspond to even singlets and odd triplets at the isotopic spin @xmath4 , and odd singlets and even triplets at @xmath5 . these dibaryons with the mass ( @xmath6 ) is the nucleon ( pion ) mass ) can decay into two nucleons , mainly emitting a photon .",
    "this is a new class of dibaryons with decay widths .",
    "the contribution of such dibaryons to strong interaction processes of hadrons is small .",
    "however , their contribution to electromagnetic processes on light nuclei may exceed the cross section for the process under study out of range of the dibaryon resonance by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the experimental discovery of such states would have important consequences for particle and nuclear physics .    in the frame of the mit bag model , mulders et al .",

    "however , the dibaryon masses obtained exceed the pion production threshold",
    ". therefore , these dibaryons can decay into the @xmath11 channel .",
    "the possibility of the existence of dibaryons with masses @xmath12 was discussed by kondratyuk et al .",
    "@xcite in the model of stretched rotating bags , taking account of spin - orbital quark interactions . in the frame of the chiral soliton model ,",
    "kopeliovich @xcite predicted that the masses of @xmath13 and @xmath14 dibaryons exceeded the two - nucleon mass by 60 and 90 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are lower than the pion production threshold",
    ".    unfortunately , all results obtained for the dibaryon masses are model dependent .",
    "therefore , only an experiment could answer the question about the existence of snds and their masses .    in the work @xcite the existence of a dibaryon , called @xmath15 , with quantum numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 which forbid its decay into two nucleons , and with the mass @xmath18 gev , and",
    "the decay width @xmath19 mev , has been postulated to explain the observed resonance - like behavior in the energy dependence of the pionic double charge exchange on nuclei at an energy below the @xmath20-resonance . however , there is a more convential interpretation of these data .",
    "it was shown @xcite in the frame of the distorted - wave impulse approximation that such a peak arises nuturally because of the pion propogation in the sequential process , in which pion double charge exhange occurs through two successive @xmath21 charge exchange reactions on two neuterons .    in the work @xcite dibaryons with exotic quantum numbers",
    "were searched for in the process @xmath22 .",
    "the experiment was performed with a proton beam from the jinr phasotron at the energy of 198 mev .",
    "two photons were detected in the energy range between of 10 and 100 mev .",
    "some structure was observed in the photon energy spectrum , which was attributed to the exotic dibaryon with the mass @xmath23 mev .",
    "the statistical significance of the effect is about 8@xmath24 .",
    "however , a big width ( fwhm=@xmath25 mev ) of the observed structure was obtained , and an additional careful experimental study of this reaction is needed in order to understand the nature of this structure .",
    "it is necessary to measure the photon energy spectrum with a higher energy resolution and a higher statistical precision .",
    "moreover , measurements at two different incident proton energies are needed to check whether the structure observed is a snd .",
    "on the other hand , an analysis @xcite of the uppsala proton - proton bremsstrahlung data looking for the presence of a dibaryon in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 mev only gave the upper limits of 10 and 3 nb for the dibaryon production cross section at proton beam energies of 200 and 310 mev , respectively .",
    "this result disagrees with the data @xcite .",
    "earlier we have carried out measurements of missing mass spectra in the reaction @xmath0 @xcite using a double - arm spectrometer at the moscow meson factory .",
    "the narrow peak in the missing mass spectrum at 1905 mev with a width equal to the experimental resolution of 7 mev has been observed in this experiment .    as will be shown below",
    ", the nucleons and the deuteron from the decay of the dibaryons under consideration into @xmath26 and @xmath27 have to be emitted in a narrow angular cone with respect to the direction of motion of the dibaryon .",
    "the size of this cone depends also on the quantum numbers of the dibaryon .",
    "so a detection of the scattered proton in coincidence with the proton ( or the deuteron ) from dibaryon decay at correlated angles gives a good possibility to separate the snds from the background and to determine their quantum numbers .",
    "in the present paper we give a more detailed study of the reactions @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are undetected particles in this experiment ) with the aim to search for snds at the moscow meson factory using an improved facility .",
    "we will consider the following dibaryons : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "it is worth noting that the state @xmath36 corresponds to the states @xmath10 and @xmath37 in the nn channel .",
    "the former is forbidden and the latter is allowed for a two - nucleon state . in our work",
    "we will study the dibaryon @xmath35 , a decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli principle ( i.e. @xmath10 state ) .",

    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the process @xmath38 , snds can be produced only if the nucleons in the deuteron overlap sufficiently , such that a six - quark state with deuteron quantum numbers can be formed . in this case ,",
    "an interaction of a photon or a meson with this state can change its quantum numbers so that a metastable state is formed .",
    "therefore , the probability of the production of such dibaryons is proportional to the probability @xmath40 of the six - quark state existing in the deuteron .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath40 can be estimated from the deuteron form factor at large @xmath41 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however , the values obtained depend strongly on the model of the form factor of the six - quark state over a broad region of @xmath41 . another way to estimate",
    "this parameter is to use the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of the deuteron magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "this method is free from the restrictions quoted above and gives @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we assume here that @xmath40 and the probability of the full overlap of nucleons in the virtual singlet state @xmath43 are equal to 0.01 .",
    "since the energy of nucleons , produced in the decay of the dibaryons under study with @xmath44 , is small , it may be expected that the main contribution to a two - nucleon system should come from @xmath45 ( deuteron ) and @xmath43 ( virtual singlet ) states .",
    "the results of calculations of the decay widths of the dibaryons into @xmath27 and @xmath26 on the basis of such assumptions are listed in table [ table1 ] .    as shown in @xcite the main contribution to the dibaryon photoproduction from the deuteron",
    "is given by the one - pion exchange diagram .",
    "therefore , we will describe the production of snds in the process @xmath46 using the one meson exchange diagram also .",
    "the production of the isoscalar dibaryons @xmath47 and @xmath33 will be calculated with the help of the pole diagram with @xmath48-meson exchange between the incident proton and the deuteron .",

    "the constants @xmath90 and @xmath91 are unknown .",
    "they are strong interaction constants . in order not to overestimate the contributions of the dibaryons we put these constants equal to 1 .",
    "the results of the calculation of the snd production cross sections in the process @xmath38 at the kinetic energy of the incident proton @xmath92 mev and the emission angle of the scattered proton @xmath93 as a function of the dibaryon mass @xmath94 are shown in fig .",

    "therefore , if we limit ourselves to the investigation of @xmath95 interactions with the photon in the final state , then the contribution of such dibaryons will essentially exceed the cross sections of the background processes . on the other hand ,",
    "the special choice of the @xmath0 kinematics allows us to allocate the area where the contribution of the snds dominates , even without detection of the final photon .",

    "the @xmath95 reaction contribution was determined by subtracting the @xmath99c spectrum from the cd@xmath98 spectrum .",
    "the exposition time of the experiment using cd@xmath98 as a target was 100 hours .",
    "this period consisted of two runs corresponding to two different kinematic conditions in order to avoid a systematic error .",
    "the charged particles produced in the reaction in question were detected at different correlated angles by the two arms mass spectrometer ( tams ) .",
    "our layout is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the left movable spectrometer arm , which is a single telescope @xmath101 , was used to measure the energy and the time of flight of the scattered proton at a fixed emission angle @xmath102 .",

    "the detection of the second charged particle in the right arm at angles close to the emission angle of particle @xmath3 with mass @xmath94 allows to suppress essentially the contribution of background processes and increase the relative contribution of a possible snd production .",
    "the right arm consisted of three telescopes which were located at @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "these angles correspond to directions of the emission of the dibaryons with a certain mass .",
    "each telescope included two thin plastic scintillation @xmath110 detectors ( @xmath111 @xmath112 ) and one @xmath113 detector of thick plastic ( @xmath114 @xmath112 , used in the right arm ) or bgo crystal ( @xmath115 @xmath112 , used in the left arm ) .",
    "each detector was viewed by a pmt-143 phototube coupled to specially developed fast electronic modules .",
    "a trigger was generated by 4-fold coincidence of the two @xmath110 detector signals of the left arm combined with those of any telescope of the right arm .",
    "a time resolution better than 0.5 ns was achieved , which allowed to suppress essentially an accidental coincidence background .",
    "the scattered proton @xmath113 signals , selected in the coincidence , formed the energy spectrum and accordingly the missing mass spectrum .",
    "each useful event including two time of flights and two energies were stored event by event and then analyzed off line .",
    "the elastic @xmath95 scattering was measured at various angles of the spectrometer arms .",
    "the proton energy spectra obtained were used to calibrate the spectrometer in the proton energy and , accordingly , in the missing mass .",

    "the experimental missing mass spectra obtained with the deuteried polyethylene target are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a , b , c ) .",
    "each spectrum corresponds to a certain combination of outgoing angles of the scattered proton and the second charged particle .",
    "these combinations in figs .",
    "[ fig3](b , c ) are consistent with the shift of the emission angle @xmath118 of the dibaryon with the given mass when the angle @xmath119 changes from @xmath106 to @xmath120 . as is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) , a resonance - like behavior of the spectra is observed for the cd@xmath98 target in two mass regions at @xmath121 mev and @xmath122 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the experiment with the carbon target resulted in a rather smooth spectra @xcite .",
    "this smoothness is caused by an essential increase of the contribution of background reactions in the interaction of the proton with the carbon .",
    "it is worth noting that the resonance structure at 1905 mev is observed in both runs at @xmath123 and @xmath124 and at different setup modifications .",
    "this essentially decreases the possibility of a random origin of the observed structure .",
    "the results obtained at different @xmath119 were summed up to improve statistics .",

    "[ fig3](a ) results in 4.9 sd and @xmath133 .",
    "if , for the number of sd , we use the expression @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 correspond , respectively , to total , background , and error bar data , then we obtain 4.2 s.d . for the peak at @xmath129 mev and 4.4 s.d . for the peak at @xmath132 mev .",
    "the widths of both observed peaks correspond to the experimental resolution ( 3 mev ) .",
    "the peak at 1924 mev was obtained only for one spectrum close to the upper limit of the missing mass . in the other cases",
    "this mass position was beyond the range of measurement .",
    "therefore , in the present work we analyze in more detail the peak at 1905 mev only .",
    "the experimental missing mass spectra in the range of 18721914 mev , after subtracting the carbon contributions , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a , b , c ) .    as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , the resonance behaviour of the cross section exhibits itself in a limited angular region .",
    "if the observed structure at @xmath129 mev corresponds to a dibaryon decaying mainly into two nucleons , then the expected angular cone size of emitted nucleons would be about 50@xmath138 .",
    "moreover , the angular distributions of the emitted nucleons are expected to be very smooth in the angular region under consideration .",
    "thus , even assuming that the dibaryon production cross section is equal to that of elastic scattering ( 40 @xmath139/sr ) its contribution to the missing mass spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a , b , c ) would be nearly the same and would not exceed 12 events .",
    "hence , the peaks found are hardly interpreted as a manifestation of the formation and decay of such states .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the decay of the snd into @xmath140 had to be characterized in the rest frame by a narrow peak near the maximum photon energy in the probability distribution of the dibaryon decay over an emitted photon energy .",
    "it leads to an essential limitation of the outgoing nucleon angles .",
    "on the other hand , if such a dibaryon decays into @xmath141 , the emitted deuteron angles are limited by the following condition : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the momentum ( in the lab .",
    "syst . ) of the dibaryon and @xmath144 is the momentum ( in the c.m.s . ) of the deuteron .    using the monte carlo simulation we estimated the contribution of the snds with different quantum numbers and @xmath94=1905 mev to the mass spectra at various angles of the left and right arms of our setup .",
    "the production cross section and branching ratio of these states were taken according to the calculations presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] and the proton beam current was assumed to be equal to 0.1 na .",
    "the results obtained for different quantum numbers and decay modes of the dibaryons are listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "this calculation showed that the angular cone of protons and deuterons emitted from a certain dibaryonic state can be rather narrow .",
    "the axis of this cone is lined up with the direction of the dibaryon emission .",
    "therefore , placing the right spectrometer arm at the expected angle of the dibaryon emission we increase essentially the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "[ fig5](a , b ) exhibit the angular distributions of charged particles ( either @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) from the decay of the dibaryon @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ) and @xmath47 ( fig .  [ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "the solid and dashed curves correspond to the emission angles of the scattered proton equal to @xmath106 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "the solid vertical lines show the location of the right arm detectors .",
    "these figures demonstrate the dependence of the angular distribution of the charged particles under consideration on the quantum numbers of the dibaryons .    in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a , b , c ) , the experimental spectra are compared with the predicted yields normalized to the maximum of the measured signal in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in these figures correspond to the states with the isospin @xmath146=1 and @xmath146=0 , respectively .",
    "the background is described by a second order polynomial .    as is seen from these figures and table [ table2 ] ,",
    "the ratios of the calculated yields to the given spectra are expected to be @xmath147 , if the state at 1905 mev is interpreted as an isovector dibaryon ( @xmath148 or @xmath35 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with our experimental data within the errors . on the other hand ,",
    "the signals from isoscalar dibaryons ( @xmath47 or @xmath33 ) could be observed in figs .",
    "[ fig4](b , c ) with the same probability .",
    "so , the dibaryon with @xmath129 mev is most likely to have the isospin equal to 1 .    in order",
    "to estimate the dibaryon production cross section , we use normalization to the elastic @xmath95 scattering and then , comparing the theoretical predictions for the yields of one of the isovector dibaryons with the experimental data , find that the differential cross section of this dibaryon production is equal to @xmath149 .",
    "that allows us to evaluate the product of unknown constants in eqs .",
    "( [ one ] ) and ( [ two ] ) . if it is a dibaryon @xmath34 , then @xmath150 .",
    "but if it is a dibaryon @xmath35 , we have @xmath151 .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath152 of the observed state could be found , for example , by a search for such dibaryons in the processes of charged pion photoproduction by polarized photons from the deuteron @xcite .    as for the structure at 1924 mev , the number of events in this peak exceeds the expected yields of the usual dibaryons ( decaying into two nucleons ) by almost two orders , even when produced with the rather big cross section of 40@xmath153 .",
