    "indeed , this positivity condition ( or another as the _ weak _ or the _ strong energy condition _ ) , is usually required for the einstein tensor of any physically acceptable spacetime .",
    "the name superenergy was first applied to the bel ",
    "robinson ( br ) and bel tensors @xcite , which are defined from the conformal weyl tensor and the riemann tensor , respectively .",
    "the motivation for this name is that they share some properties with energy  momentum tensors .",
    "the prefix super appears because they are rank-4 tensors instead of rank-2 . in @xcite , senovilla defined an algebraic construction which generates a _ basic superenergy tensor _ @xmath2 , from an arbitrary _ seed tensor _ @xmath3 .",
    "a much more extensive treatment discussing properties and applications is found in @xcite . this construction unifies , in a single procedure , the br and bel tensors and many energy ",

    "the most important feature of the basic superenergy tensors @xmath2 is that , independently of the seed tensor @xmath3 , they automatically satisfy the _",

    "this property holds in any dimension , provided that the space has lorentzian signature , when the dp in fact can be defined .",

    "the concept in mind is that the _ total _ superenergy may be conserved .",
    "this possibility would provide a physical relevance to the superenergy tensor of a field , in the same sense that the conservation of energy justifies even its physical ` existence ' .",

    "bergqvist @xcite reformulated @xmath2 using 2-spinors .",
    "the spinorial expression enabled an elegant proof of the dp .",
    "however , this proof is only valid for four dimensions .",
    "a general proof for arbitrary dimension in tensorial notation was presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we presented an alternative formulation of @xmath2 using the clifford algebra .",

    "we refer the reader to section [ sec : conserved ] and to the bibliography for more details .    the use of the @xmath4-fold clifford algebra @xmath87 enables us to introduce an alternative and much more compact definition of the basic superenergy tensor .",

    "the expression of the superenergy tensor for the signature @xmath74 is slightly more simple : @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , the reason for the sign @xmath93 is that , for the signature @xmath72 , a time - like vector must be _ past - pointing _ to give a positive quantity when contracted with a _ future - pointing _ vector .    in the remaining part of the section",
    ", we will show that both expressions , senovilla s standard - tensorial definition ( [ tens_def ] ) and the clifford algebra formulation ( [ clif_def ] ) , correspond to the same object .",
    "the method for proving this identity will be expansion of ( [ clif_def ] ) in order to obtain ( [ tens_def ] ) .",
    "we must remark here that senovilla s definition applies to degree - defined @xmath4-fold multivectors . in contrast , expression ( [ clif_def ] ) can be applied to general @xmath4-fold multivectors .",
    "we will comment on this generalization later .",
    "but evidently , for this proof , we must consider only degree - defined @xmath4-fold multivectors .",
    "let us concentrate on a single arbitrary block .",
    "using multi - fold multi - indices , the components ( [ components ] ) can be written as @xmath94 @xmath95    to re - express the result in this @xmath27th block , we take into account two essential facts .",
    "the first is that the clifford product of any multivector with a vector can be split into inner and exterior products : @xmath96 with this expansion the block @xmath97 should split into four terms .",
    "but since @xmath3 is degree - defined , the cross terms can not contract completely and vanish .",
    "thus , it splits into two terms , [ crossterms ] 0e__ia^ e__i= 0 ( e__ia^ ) ( e__i ) + 0 ( e__ia^ ) ( e__i ) .",
    "the second fact is that an exterior product can be written , with the help of the hodge duality , as an inner product . applying it ,",
    "the second term has the same structure as the first term , but whereas in the first we have the original @xmath98-vector , @xmath99 , in the second we have the dual @xmath100-vector , @xmath101 , @xmath102\\big)\\ ,      \\big ( e_{\\nu_i}\\cdot \\conju{[*a^{\\uls{e } \\uls{f}}]\\!}\\big )     \\ , \\rangle}_{0 } } .\\ ] ]    repeating this expansion for every block we obtain @xmath12 terms , corresponding to all possible combinations that take the dual in some blocks and leave the rest unchanged , [ summation ] t\\{a}__1 _ 1 _ r _ r= ( -1)^r12_p 0 ( ( e__1e__r ) a_p )  ( ( e__1 e__r ) )    where the dot denotes the inner product in every block , and we have used @xmath77 again to indicate each combination of hodge duals . finally , comparing this last expression with ( [ tens_def ] ) , we only have to check that the terms of this summation ( [ summation ] ) coincide with senovilla s cross product ( [ cross ] ) , @xmath103 this can be seen by realizing that the dot products in ( [ summation ] ) fix one index in each factor for each block .",
    "the scalar projection of the product selects the terms that correspond to the contraction of the rest of the indices .",
    "it is easy to check that the signs coincide .",
    "then , the proof is complete .",
    "the basic superenergy tensor defined in @xcite is symmetric , by construction , in each pair of indices : @xmath104 however , this property only holds for a degree - defined @xmath4-fold multivector @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath3 is non - degree - defined , formula ( [ crossterms ] ) is no longer valid because there can be contributions from terms mixing different degrees .",
    "let us see which non - trivial elements appear when we consider general @xmath4-fold multivectors .    first , consider a simple multivector as a seed , split it into its different degrees @xmath105}$ ] , where @xmath106}\\in\\l_k$ ] .",
    "then , the contribution of each degree to the tensor t\\{a } is given by - 2t\\{a}(u , v ) & = & _ k=0^d0ua _ kv _ k + & = & _ k0(ua_[k+1]+ua_[k-1 ] ) ( v + v ) + & = & _ k  0(ua_[k+1])(v)+ 0(ua_[k-1])(v ) + & & + 0(ua_[k+1])(v)+ 0(ua_[k-1])(v ) . the first pair of terms was already present in formula ( [ crossterms ] ) , while the last pair collects the non - vanishing terms mixing different degrees .",
    "observe that these extra terms only contain factors differing in two degrees .",
    "this means , for instance , that a bivector combines only with scalars and 4-vectors . besides , the contribution of these terms is always antisymmetric in the pair of indices .",
    "then , the total superenergy tensor @xmath2 can be written as the sum of the symmetric superenergy tensors generated by each degree and the antisymmetric mixing terms : @xmath107}\\}(u , v ) +       \\sum_k{{\\langle { { \\langle a_{[k+2]}\\rev{a_{[k ] } } \\rangle}_{2}}(v\\w u ) \\rangle}_{0}}\\ ] ] or written with tensorial indices @xmath108}\\}_{\\mu\\nu } +       \\sum_k \\frac{1}{k!}(a_{[k+2]})_{\\mu\\nu\\rho_1\\cdots\\rho_k }          ( a_{[k]})^{\\rho_1\\cdots\\rho_k }   .\\ ] ] for the more general case of @xmath4-fold multivectors , this splitting will occur in each block .",
    "thus , it can appear as any combination of terms symmetric in some blocks and antisymmetric in the rest , so that no symmetry is satisfied in general .",
    "another possible symmetry is the one involving the interchange of different pairs of indices .",
    "it is easy to see that , if @xmath53 is symmetric or antisymmetric in any two blocks , then , @xmath2 will be symmetric in the interchange of the respective pair of indices : @xmath109 this property is independent of @xmath3 being degree - defined or not .",
    "a general lorentz transformation of a vector @xmath110 is performed by a _ versor _",

    "pauli , dirac , weyl and majorana spinor fields can be treated as _ operator spinors _",
    "the concept of operator spinor is based on identifying spinors as elements of the even subalgebra @xmath138 .",
    "the name is motivated because a spinor is then interpreted as a generalization of a rotor , which links the observer tetrad field @xmath91 to the bilinear observables associated with the spinor .",
    "typically , for a dirac spinor @xmath139 , the current and the spin vectors , and the magnetization bivector are given by @xmath140 for weyl and majorana spinors , these expressions are also valid .",
    "however , these spinors are not general even multivectors but elements of two specific subsets of @xmath141 .",
    "thus , their current @xmath142 is light - like .",
    "operator spinors are represented by multivectors .",
    "but they are not _ tensors _ because they relate the observables , which are objective quantities ( tensors ) , to the observer",
    ". they can be considered ` pseudo'-tensors in the same sense as affine connections .",
    "thus , a spinor is inseparably related to the observer tetrad .",
    "for this reason , its associated superenergy tensor @xmath143 , is only a tensor for the first index , since the second is related to the observer : @xmath144 .",

    "we must underline that this proof is valid for a general @xmath4-fold multivector @xmath3 .",

    "a good example which illustrates the possibilities of the @xmath4-fold clifford formulation is the treatment of the principal null directions of a tensor . in special and general relativity",
    ", the concept of principal null directions has been mainly used in the algebraic classification of the electromagnetic field and weyl tensor ( petrov classification ) @xcite , which are , respectively , a bivector and a double bivector .",

    "this theorem is a generalization of the well - known result @xcite relating the pnds of the weyl tensor , @xmath158\\mu\\nu[\\gamma}\\,\\ell_{\\delta]}\\ell^\\nu=0 $ ] , to the null directions that make the br superenergy tensor vanish , @xmath159 .",
    "we have shown that the basic superenergy tensors @xmath2 satisfy the dp independently of the generating tensor @xmath3 .",
    "the other important property expected to be satisfied by the energy  momentum tensor of any isolated physical field ( or the total energy  momentum ) is its local conservation : @xmath160 .",
    "the extension for general superenergy tensors is simply [ divergence ] ^_1t__1_1_r_r=0 . obviously , this property depends on the differential equations governing the physical field , namely on the dynamics of the field . in this section",
    "we give ( theorem [ the : sufcond ] ) a sufficient condition for the generating field @xmath3 , which guarantees the conservation of its basic superenergy tensor @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , this sufficient condition is satisfied by some physical fields such as the electromagnetic field , the klein ",
    "gordon field and the riemann and weyl tensors in einstein spaces .",
    "consequently , the divergence - free property of the standard electromagnetic and klein  gordon energy  momentum tensors , and the bel and bel  robinson superenergy tensors , is unified in a unique procedure .",
    "the case of the current of the dirac field is also embraced by this condition , if we consider a generalization of it ( theorem [ the : sufcond3 ] ) which will require some discussion .",
    "a characteristic feature of the sufficient condition presented here is that its simplest and most natural expression is written using clifford algebras .",
    "however , we will also write its standard tensorial equivalent .",
    "first , let us write equation ( [ divergence ] ) for the basic superenergy tensor using the @xmath4-fold clifford algebra formalism : @xmath161 here some notational conventions are used .",
    "the differential operator @xmath162 is algebraically a vector , hence it multiplies the first block .",
    "the overdots are used to indicate which elements must be derived by the operator . in the absence of overdots , @xmath163 affects only the element found immediately to its right - hand side .",
    "note that the set of vectors @xmath164 must not be derived , since we want to derive only the tensor @xmath2 . using the leibnitz rule and the cyclic property of the scalar part of a product , we obtain [ nabladivergence ] t\\{a}()= ( -1)^r 12 ( a _ 0,1,,1- a _ 0,1,,1 ) = ( -1)^r a _ 0,1,,1 . here we see that @xmath165 is the unique differentiated quantity which contributes to the divergence",
    ". as is evident , @xmath166 is a sufficient condition for the superenergy tensor @xmath2 being divergence - free .",
    "but there is a more general sufficient condition :    in order to express condition ( [ sufficientcond ] ) in index tensorial notation , we need to split @xmath3 into its different degrees for the first block : @xmath167}}\\qquad{\\rm where}\\quad       a_{[k]}=\\frac{1}{k ! }      a_{[\\mu_1\\cdots\\mu_k]\\uls{c}}\\ e^{\\mu_1\\cdots\\mu_k}\\ot e^{\\uls{c } }      \\,\\in\\l_k\\ot\\l\\ot\\cdots\\ot\\l\\ ] ] and then collect the contributions to different degrees coming from exterior and inner products : [ nablasplit ] a = a a_[k-1]+a_[k+1]=a_[k ] k=0,  ,d where @xmath168})_{\\mu_1\\mu_2\\cdots\\mu_k\\uls{c}}=      k\\nabla_{[\\mu_1 } a_{\\mu_2\\cdots\\mu_k]\\uls{c } }      \\quad{\\rm and}\\quad      ( \\nabla\\inn a_{[k+1]})_{\\mu_1\\mu_2\\cdots\\mu_k\\uls{c}}=      \\frac{1}{k+1}\\nabla^{\\nu } a_{\\nu\\mu_1\\mu_2\\cdots\\mu_k\\,\\uls{c } } .\\ ] ]    this sufficient condition is satisfied by diverse physical fields , so that the vanishing of the divergence of their energy or superenergy tensors follows from theorem [ the : sufcond ] :    * the source - free electromagnetic field . the full set of maxwell equations for the faraday bivector takes the form @xmath169 , and the standard energy ",
    "momentum tensor is @xmath86 .",
    "then , it immediately follows : @xmath170 . *",
    "the klein ",
    "gordon field : @xmath171 its standard energy ",
    "momentum tensor is generated by @xmath172 : t\\{(+m)}_&= & t\\{}_+t\\{m}_= -120e_e _ -120e_m e _ + & = & _ _ -12 _ ^g _ -12 m^2 ^ 2 g _",
    ". we can easily check that it satisfies condition ( [ sufficientcond ] ) , [ k - g - condition ] ( + m)=m(+m ) t\\{(+m)}=0 . *",
    "the weyl conformal and the riemann tensor in einstein spaces .",
    "einstein spaces satisfy @xmath173 . for @xmath174",
    ", these conditions easily follow from the differential bianchy identity , @xmath175 , and the lanczos identity , @xmath176 ( where @xmath177 is the double hodge dual of the riemann ) . for @xmath178",
    "the equations also hold , but they are a bit more difficult to show . therefore , we obtain @xmath179 which says that the generalizations of the bel  robinson , @xmath80 , and the bel , @xmath82 , superenergy tensors are divergence - free in einstein spaces of any dimension .",
    "some examples of constant @xmath180-fold multivector differential operators are : @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , with @xmath184 constants .",
    "now consider that we have an @xmath4-fold multivector @xmath53 satisfying condition ( [ sufficientcond ] ) with @xmath185 constant .",
    "let @xmath186 be a constant @xmath51-fold multivector differential operator .",
    "we can then construct the @xmath187-fold multivector @xmath188 where @xmath189 differentiates @xmath3 .",
    "a simple example is provided by @xmath190 .",
    "then , the @xmath187-fold multivector @xmath148 also satisfies condition ( [ sufficientcond ] ) , except for terms involving the non - commutativity of derivatives : @xmath191}$ ] , i.e. involving terms linear in the riemann tensor or its derivatives : [ riemannterms ] ( a)=+o(r)= (a)+o(r ) .",
    "hence , for flat spacetimes we get the result :    thus , from theorem [ the : sufcond ] the superenergy tensor @xmath192 will be divergence - free .",
    "thus , from theorem [ the : sufcond ] , the derived tensors @xmath148 obtained in any of these two theorems , will generate a divergence - free superenergy tensor @xmath192 .",
    "examples of these constructions are provided by the superenergy tensors proposed by senovilla @xcite and previously introduced in @xcite , for the electromagnetic and klein  gordon fields :    * for the source - free electromagnetic field , the rank-4 superenergy tensor which has been considered @xcite is the full symmetrization of @xmath193 . from theorems [ the : construct0 ] and [ the : sufcond ]",
    ", it follows that the tensor @xmath193 is divergence - free for flat spacetimes : @xmath194 however , there the divergence of the tensor @xmath195 also contributes in the divergence of the symmetrized tensor .",
    "this term also vanishes in flat spacetimes , as follows from theorems [ the : construct ] and [ the : sufcond ] : @xmath196 thus , the symmetrized electromagnetic superenergy tensor is divergence - free .",
    "* for the klein",
    " gordon field the rank-4 superenergy tensor @xcite is @xmath197 . from ( [ k - g - condition ] ) we know that @xmath198 satisfies condition ( [ sufficientcond ] ) with @xmath199 constant",
    ". therefore , applying theorem [ the : construct ] , for flat spacetimes we get ( ( + m)(+m))=m((+m)(+m ) ) + t\\{(+m)(+m)}=0 .",
    "let us now introduce a generalization of the sufficient condition ( [ sufficientcond ] ) , which we will apply to the current of the dirac field",
    ". we will generalize ( [ sufficientcond ] ) in two steps .",
    "the first consists in allowing the scalar @xmath185 to be a more general multivector .",
    "observe that the result of theorem [ the : construct ] is trivially generalized for the condition ( [ sufficientcond2 ] ) .",
    "the second step consists in allowing factors multiplying @xmath3 on both sides to appear : @xmath200 .",
    "but in this case , the divergence of the superenergy tensor @xmath2 depends on the commutativity of the right - hand factor @xmath79 with the vectors to which @xmath2 is applied .",
    "hence , the result is not the vanishing of the divergence , but of the divergence applied to some collection of @xmath4 vectors : @xmath201 .",
    "for this reason , the result can be applied to the current of a dirac field @xmath202 .",
    "the hestenes real multivector formulation of the dirac equation for a spinor minimally coupled with an electromagnetic field is @xcite @xmath203 where @xmath139 is the operator spinor described in section [ sec : lorentz&spinors ] , and @xmath3 is the electromagnetic vector potential . observe that , although the _ dirac  hestenes equation _ is usually written for the signature @xmath204 , it can also be formulated for the signature @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "we can easily see that @xmath145 satisfies the conditions of the theorem [ the : sufcond3 ] , with @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 , for @xmath202 : @xmath210 since @xmath211 is an inertial observer in special relativity , the current is conserved : @xmath212",
