    "the concept of a liquid - liquid transition ( llt ) between two distinct ( metastable ) supercooled liquids has attracted considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "some evidence for llts has been obtained in model systems  @xcite and metallic glass formers  @xcite .",
    "such transitions remain highly controversial both in metallic systems  @xcite and molecular systems such as water  @xcite .",
    "the application of thermodynamic concepts is , strictly speaking , not admissible due to the finite lifetime of both liquids , but might be a practical tool in situations where this lifetime vastly exceeds both typical measurement times and structural relaxation times .",
    "typical glass forming liquids often fall into this category .    at the glass transition",
    "the liquid falls out of equilibrium , in particular it acquires a memory of its preparation .",
    "although this event precludes a direct observation , many theoretical approaches invoke an underlying thermodynamic transition .",
    "examples include the transition to an amorphous ground state ( the `` ideal glass '' )  @xcite or a llt to a state with the atoms arranged in certain geometric motifs or _ locally favoured structures _  @xcite .",
    "the pinning ( or confinement ) of particles has been argued to shift a thermodynamic transition into the accessible regime  @xcite , and a loss of configurational entropy indicated by a peak in the heat capacity  @xcite has been reported .",
    "although convincing evidence for an underlying thermodynamic transition remains elusive , it has been demonstrated recently that there is a _ dynamical _ transition in the space of _ trajectories _ , _ i.e. _ , sequences of configurations . under biased sampling trajectories of sufficient length",
    "undergo a first - order transition between an _ active _ phase ( the supercooled liquid ) and a dynamically _ inactive _ phase , which has been observed both in idealized lattice models  @xcite and in simulations of atomistic model glass formers  @xcite .",
    "the latter case affords a systematic computational means of preparing exceptionally stable glass states  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for other methods to prepare ultra - stable glasses ) .",
    "one suitable means to generate such transitions in trajectory space is to employ biased sampling of trajectories based on an order parameter characterizing _ time - averaged _ populations of locally favoured structures ( lfs )  @xcite .",
    "connections between these inactive phases prepared _ in silico _ and those found in experiment ( where there is no bias ) are only just beginning to be addressed  @xcite .",
    "configurations visited in the inactive phase have interesting properties . while still amorphous , they are very stable with very large structural relaxation times . moreover ,",
    "steepest descent quenches to _ inherent states _ indicate that the inactive phase probes configurations very deep in the energy landscape relative to `` normal '' liquid configurations  @xcite .",
    "the latter observation opens the possibility that these configurations have a finite weight also in the equilibrium boltzmann ensemble at a lower temperature .",
    "a major obstacle in probing the link between deeply supercooled liquids and the inactive phase is that in glass formers time scales are far beyond direct computational methods such as molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . here , to circumvent this problem",
    "we employ a reweighting technique to gain insights into the behavior at very low temperatures from data sampled at a mildly supercooled temperature .",
    "the technique exploits the time - scale separation between vibrations and structural relaxation  @xcite , whereby the relaxation time is nevertheless small enough to allow efficient sampling .",
    "we find a peak in the specific heat capacity @xmath0 at a temperature @xmath1 higher than the extrapolated kauzmann temperature @xmath2 corresponding to an `` ideal glass '' state .",
    "moreover , we show that this peak is related to the transition in trajectory space to the dynamical phase rich in lfs  @xcite . from this numerical evidence",
    "we conclude the existence of a llt at @xmath3 from the supercooled liquid to a state rich in lfs .",
    "we consider the kob - andersen binary mixture  @xcite , a well studied atomistic glass former that consists of 80% large particles ( a ) and 20% small particles ( b ) interacting through truncated and shifted lennard - jones pair potentials .",
    "we employ the original potential parameters .",
    "all numerical values are reported in lennard - jones units with respect to the large particles , and we set boltzmann s constant to unity .",
    "we study a system of @xmath4 particles at number density @xmath5 in a box with constant volume @xmath6 .",
    "our numerical scheme  @xcite harvests trajectories with fixed number of configurations @xmath7 at temperature @xmath8 through a combination of transition path sampling moves ( shifting and half - shooting moves ) to generate trial trajectories  @xcite , the metropolis criterion to accept or reject trajectories , and replica exchange between quadratic biasing potentials of the appropriate order parameter : the inherent state energy per particle @xmath9 and the population @xmath10 of particles in lfs , which couples to an external field @xmath11 . in this model",
    ", the lfs is a bicapped square antiprism  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we calculate the average of an observable @xmath12 at different state points with @xmath13 the brackets @xmath14 denote the average over the sampled trajectories using their unbiased equilibrium weight as indicated by the subscript .",
    "this expression is evaluated employing the multistate bennett acceptance ratio method  @xcite . assuming that inherent state energies and vibrational free energy decouple ( as appropriate here ) , it is straightforward to show that averages of observables @xmath15 that only depend on @xmath9 are equilibrium averages in the absence of the field ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "first pointed out by kauzmann in 1948  @xcite , the possibility that @xmath18 is reached at a finite temperature @xmath2 has intrigued scientists ever since . figuratively speaking , at this temperature",

    "we limit the number of fire iterations to 1,000 .",
