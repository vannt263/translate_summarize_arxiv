    "many complex systems , such as glasses , spin glasses , irreversible gels , colloidal gels and others , exhibit a complex dynamics , all characterized by a slowing down usually leading to a structural arrest .",
    "nevertheless there are significative differences , among these systems , often not well clarified .",
    "one of the key concept to describe the slow dynamics in glassy systems is the concept of dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "here we want to classify and compare the above systems by looking at the behavior of the so called non - linear dynamical susceptibility , a quantity usually introduced to quantitatively characterize the dynamical heterogeneities . in glass",
    "forming liquids different definitions have been proposed for the non linear dynamical susceptibility @xcite .",
    "mostly considered are the fluctuations of the self and the total intermediate scattering functions .",
    "these quantities typically have similar behavior , grow with the time , reach a maximum and then decrease at large time .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the transient nature of dynamical heterogeneities and the absence of a diverging static correlation length . on the other hand for systems with quenched interactions such as spin glasses , characterized by a diverging static correlation length at spin glass critical temperature ,",
    "the dynamical susceptibility defined as the fluctuations of the time dependent spin - spin autocorrelation function is a monotonic function increasing with the time .",
    "as the time goes to infinity this dynamical susceptibility for a fixed temperature t tends to a plateau whose value coincides with the static non - linear susceptibility .",
    "therefore as t approaches the spin glass temperature the value of the plateau diverges as the static non - linear susceptibility . in irreversible gels the definition of the corresponding dynamic susceptibility",
    "is not straightforward and one should carefully distinguish different dynamical quantities .",
    "we have recently shown @xcite that in a microscopic model for irreversible gels the dynamical susceptibility defined as the fluctuations of the self - intermediate scattering function is a monotonic function as in the case of spin glasses and , for each fixed value of the volume fraction , its long time limit tends to a plateau whose value coincides with the mean cluster size .",
    "the value of this plateau therefore diverges at the percolation threshold as the mean cluster size .",
    "such finding corresponds to the fact that in irreversible gelation the heterogeneities are due to the static nature of the clusters . on this basis",
    ", we speculate that in colloidal gelation , where clusters are not permanent due to the finite bond lifetime , this non - linear susceptibility should show a behavior similar to the dynamical susceptibility of the irreversible gel at very low temperature and very low volume fraction , where the lifetime of the bonds is much larger than the structural relaxation time . at higher volume fractions and temperature , it should crossover towards a behavior of glass forming liquids . here",
    "we give some evidence based on some molecular dynamics simulations of a model for colloidal gelation @xcite .",
    "moreover , using this scenario , we interpret previous results found in experimental investigations of colloidal suspension @xcite and in some molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "finally , we show that also in spin glass type of models when the lifetime of the interaction is made finite the behavior found is similar to that found in colloidal systems @xcite .    in the following",
    ", first we recall the behaviour of linear dynamical susceptibility of glass forming liquids and spin glasses ( sect.[sglass ] ) . later",
    "( sect.[gels ] ) we consider the case of irreversible gels . in sect.[collgel ] , we discuss the case of colloidal gelation and compare with a spin glass type of model with annealed interactions ( sect[ann ] ) . finally we analyze the emerging scenario and the further developments that this study suggests ( sect.[conclu ] ) .",
    "we briefly recall the @xmath0 ising spin glass where the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath1 , with @xmath2 ising spins , and @xmath3 quenched and disordered interactions .",
    "the @xmath0 model undergoes a transition at a temperature , @xmath4 , with a divergence of the static non - linear susceptibility , @xmath5 $ ] , where the average @xmath6 is over the boltzmann measure , and the average @xmath7 $ ] is over the disorder configurations .",

    "the plateau value coincides with the static non - linear susceptibility and diverges at the transition @xcite .      in this section",
    "we present a molecular dynamics ( md ) study of a microscopic model recently introduced @xcite for irreversible gels .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 system of @xmath13 particles interacting via a lennard - jones potential , truncated in order to have only the repulsive part : @xmath14 , & r_{ij}<2^{1/6}\\sigma \\\\ 0 , & r_{ij}\\ge2^{1/6}\\sigma \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the distance between the particles @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "after a first equilibration , we introduce quenched bonds between particles whose relative distance is smaller than @xmath18 by adding an attractive potential : @xmath19 , & r_{ij } < r_0\\\\ \\infty , & r_{ij}\\ge r_0 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] representing a finitely extendable non - linear elastic ( fene ) @xcite .",

    "the unit length is @xmath23 , the unit energy @xmath27 and the boltzmann constant @xmath28 is set equal to @xmath29 .",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath30 and the volume fraction @xmath31 is varied from @xmath32 to @xmath33 . by varying the volume fraction we find that the system undergoes a percolation transition in the universality class of the random percolation .",
    "we have investigated the dynamical evolution of the system by studying the self intermediate scattering functions , @xmath34 , for increasing volume fractions . as in experiments on real gels ,",
    "we observe stretched exponential decays at volume fraction lower than the percolation threshold @xmath35 , and approaching @xmath35 the onset of power law decays .    we have moreover measured the dynamical susceptibility associated to the fluctuations of the self intermediate scattering functions @xcite , i.e. @xmath36 is the thermal average for a fixed bond configuration and @xmath37 $ ] is the average over the bond configurations .",
    "we have shown analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite that this quantity , in the thermodynamic limit , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , tends to the mean cluster size .    in the main frame of fig.[fig5 ] , @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 ) is plotted for increasing values of the volume fractions @xmath42 . differently from the non monotonic behavior",

    "the exponent , within the numerical accuracy , is in agreement with the value of the exponent @xmath47 of the mean cluster size .",
    "this finding confirms that one key difference between irreversible gelation due to chemical bonds and supercooled liquids close to the glass transition is that in irreversible gelation the heterogeneities have a static nature ( clusters ) .",

    "although these systems have a very different structures , they show a very similar dynamical behavior due to the static nature of heterogeneities . in both cases interactions",
    "are quenched .",
    "what can we expect in the cases where the interactions are not quenched and have a finite lifetime ? in the following section we will try to answer to this question .",
