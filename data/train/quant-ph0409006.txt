    "the time plays a special role in quantum mechanics . unlike other observables ,",
    "time remains a classical variable .",
    "it can not be simply quantized because , as it is well known , the self - adjoint operator of time does not exist for the bounded hamiltonians .",
    "the problems related to time also arise from the fact that in quantum mechanics many quantities can not have definite values simultaneously .",
    "the absence of the time operator makes this problem even more complicated .",
    "however , in practice the time is often important for an experimenter .",
    "if quantum mechanics can correctly describe the outcomes of the experiments , it must also give the method for the calculation of the time the particle spends in some region .",
    "the most - known problem of time in quantum mechanics is the so - called  tunneling time problem  .",
    "tunneling phenomena are inherent in numerous quantum systems , ranging from an atom and condensed matter to quantum fields .",
    "there have been many attempts to define a physical time for tunneling processes , since this question has been raised by maccoll @xcite in 1932 .",
    "this question is still the subject of much controversy , since numerous theories contradict each other in their predictions for `` the tunneling time '' .",
    "some of these theories predict that the tunneling process is faster than light , whereas the others state that it should be subluminal .",
    "this subject has been covered in a number of reviews ( hauge and stvneng @xcite , 1989 ; olkholovsky and recami @xcite , 1992 ; landauer and martin @xcite , 1994 and chiao and steinberg @xcite , 1997 ) .",
    "the fact that there is a time related to the tunneling process has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , the results of the experiments are ambiguous .",
    "many problems with time in quantum mechanics arise from the noncommutativity of the operators .",
    "the noncommutativity of the operators in quantum mechanics can be circumvented by using the concept of weak measurements .",
    "the concept of weak measurement was proposed by aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite .",
    "such an approach has several advantages .",
    "it gives , in principle , the procedure for measuring the physical quantity .",
    "second , since in the classical mechanics all quantities can have definite values simultaneously , weak measurements give the correct classical limit .",
    "the concept of weak measurements has been already applied to the time problem in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the time in classical mechanics describes not a single state of the system but the process of the evolution .",
    "this property is an essential concept of the time .",
    "we speak about the time belonging to a certain evolution of the system . if the measurement of the time disturbs the evolution we can not attribute this measured duration to the undisturbed evolution .",
    "therefore , we should require that the measurement of the time does not disturb the motion of the system .",
    "this means that the interaction of the system with the measuring device must be asymptotically weak . in quantum mechanics",
    "this means that we can not use the strong measurements described by the von - neumann s projection postulate .",
    "we have to use the weak measurements of aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite , instead .",
    "we proceed as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : concept ] we present the model of the weak measurements .",
    "[ sec : the - time - on ] presents the time on condition that the system is in the given final state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tunneling - time ] , our formalism is applied to the tunneling time problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak - measurement - of ] the weak measurement of the quantum arrival time distribution is presented .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] summarizes our findings .",
    "in this section we present the concept of weak measurement , proposed by aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite .",
    "we measure quantity represented by the operator @xmath1 .",
    "we have the detector in the initial state @xmath2 .",
    "for a weak measurement to provide the meaningful information the measurements must be performed on an ensemble of identical systems .",
    "it is supposed that each system with its own detector is prepared in the same initial state .",
    "after measurement the readings of the detectors are collected and averaged .",
    "our model consists of the system * s * under consideration and of the detector * d*. the total hamiltonian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the hamiltonians of the system and detector , respectively .",
    "we take the operator describing the interaction between the particle and the detector of the form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 characterizes the strength of the interaction between the system and detector .",
    "the small parameter @xmath7 ensures the undisturbance of the system s evolution .",
    "the measurement duration is @xmath8 . in this section",
    "we assume that the interaction strength @xmath7 and the time @xmath8 are small .",
    "the operator @xmath9 acts in the hilbert space of the detector .",
    "we require the spectrum of the operator @xmath9 to be continuous . for simplicity , we can consider this operator to be the coordinate of the detector .",
    "the momentum which conjugate to @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction operator ( [ eq : sec2:11a ] ) only slightly differs from the one used by aharonov , albert and vaidman @xcite .",
    "the similar interaction operator has been considered by von neumann @xcite and has been widely used in the strong measurement models ( e.g. , @xcite and many others ) .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sec2:11a ] ) represents a constant force acting on the detector .",
    "this force results in the change of momentum of the detector . from the classical point of view",
    ", the change of the momentum is proportional to the force acting on the detector .",
    "since interaction strength @xmath7 and the duration of the measurement @xmath8 are small , the average @xmath12 should not change significantly during the measurement .",
    "the action of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : sec2:11a ] ) results in the small change of the mean detector momentum @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean momentum of the detector at the beginning of the measurement and @xmath15 is the mean momentum of the detector after the measurement .",
    "therefore , in analogy to ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the `` weak value '' of the average @xmath12 , @xmath16    at the moment @xmath17 the density matrix of the whole system is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the density matrix of the system and @xmath20 is the density matrix of the detector . after the interaction the density matrix of the detector is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the evolution operator . later , for simplicity we shall neglect the hamiltonian of the detector .",

    "( [ eq : sec2:defin ] ) we obtain that the weak value coincides with the usual average @xmath26 .",
    "the influence of the weak measurement on the evolution of the measured system can be made arbitrary small using the small parameter @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , after the interaction of the measured system with the detector we can try to measure the second observable @xmath27 using , as usual , the strong measurement . as far as our model gives the correct result for the value of @xmath28 averaged over the entire ensemble of the systems , now we can try to take the average only over the subensemble of the systems with the given value of the quantity @xmath29 .",
    "we measure the momenta @xmath30 of each measuring device after the interaction with the system .",
    "subsequently , we perform the final , postselection measurement of @xmath29 on the systems of our ensemble . then we collect the outcomes @xmath11 only of the systems which have a given value of @xmath29 .    the joint probability that the system has the given value of @xmath29 _ and _ the detector has the momentum @xmath31 at the time moment @xmath32 is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the eigenfunction of the momentum operator @xmath35 . in quantum mechanics",

    "really , in the tunneling time problem we ask about the duration the particle spends in a specified region of the space , and we know that the particle has tunneled out , i.e. , it is on the other side of the barrier .",
    "we can expect that such a question can not always be answered . here",
    "our goal is to obtain the conditions under which it is possible to answer such question .",
    "one of the possibilities to solve the time problem is to answer what exactly the word `` time '' means .",
    "the meaning of every physical quantity is determined by the procedure of its measurement .",
    "therefore , we have to construct a scheme of an experiment ( this can be a _ gedanken _ experiment ) which measures the quantity with the properties corresponding to the classical time .",

    "was introduced by steinberg @xcite and developed in our paper @xcite .",
    "the strong limit of such a model for analysis of the measurement effect for the quantum jumps has been used in ref .",

    "this force induces the change of the detector s momentum . from the classical point of view , the change of the momentum is proportional to the time the particle spends in the region around @xmath49 , and the coefficient of proportionality equals the force acting on the detector .",
    "we assume that the change of the mean momentum of the detector is proportional to the time the constant force acts on the detector and that the time the particle spends in the detector s region coincides with the time the force acts on the detector .",

    "these quantities are useful in the case of tunneling and we suppose that they can be useful also for other problems .    in order to investigate the tunneling time problem , we consider a procedure of time measurement , proposed by steinberg @xcite .",
    "this procedure shows clearly the consequences of noncommutativity of the operators and the possibility of determination of the asymptotic time .",
    "our model also reveals the hartmann and fletcher effect , i.e. , for opaque barriers the effective velocity is very large because the contribution of the barrier region to the time is almost zero .",
    "we can not determine whether this velocity can be larger than @xmath332 because for this purpose one has to use a relativistic equation ( e.g. , the dirac equation ) .",
    "the definition of density of one sided arrivals is proposed .",
    "this definition is extended to quantum mechanics , using the concept of weak measurements by aharonov _",
