    "the synthesis of graphene , a two - dimensional material composed of carbon atoms organized in a honeycomb lattice , had a huge impact in condensed - matter physics . due to the lattice geometry",
    ", this material has two inequivalent dirac points ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , each one associated to a valley degree of freedom . in the vicinity of these points , the free electrons",
    "exhibit a linear dispersion relation , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the fermi velocity , which has a bare value three hundred times smaller than the speed of light .    even before the isolation and characterization of graphene @xcite ,",
    "field - theoretical studies have predicted the effect of interactions in two - dimensional dirac systems , where the electrons and the photons can live in different dimensions @xcite .",
    "indeed , in graphene and other 2d systems , such as silicene or phosphorene , e.g. , the electrons are constrained to move on a plane , while the mediators of the interaction ( photons ) can propagate in a three - dimensional space .",
    "different from usual quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , these kind of effective theories generate a coulomb potential between the electrons proportional to the inverse of the distance , similar to qed in ( 3 + 1)d . an important question in the description of the dirac electrons in graphene",
    "is how the fermi velocity renormalizes due to interactions .",
    "a renormalization - group study predicted logarithmic corrections to the fermi velocity as a function of doping ( or energy ) @xcite , which were later observed in many experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , the renormalized @xmath0 also depends strongly on the dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the graphene sample .    the experimental confirmation of this renormalization called the attention to the role of interactions in graphene .",
    "moreover , since the fermi velocity is the characteristic velocity of the system , all the physical observables carry this information and this effect is also seen in indirect measurements , e.g. , in the quantum capacitance @xcite and in the spin @xmath5-factor @xcite . a theoretical description of the corrections to the @xmath5-factor due to interactions can only account for the experimental data upon insertion of the renormalized fermi velocity and dielectric constant as a function of doping @xcite .",
    "although theoretical studies have clarified the role of interactions in renormalizing the fermi velocity , most of the experiments verifying this behavior are performed in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the remaining question , to be answered theoretically , is then whether the renormalization - group functions are modified or not due to a magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the graphene plane .    a study of the schwinger - dyson equations in the _ static _ limit in the presence of a magnetic field suggests a renormalization of the fermi velocity in each of the landau levels due to electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental findings are well fitted by a renormalization - group description that ignores the magnetic field .",
    "an important issue in this comparison is the intensity of the magnetic field . although the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite are made in the  weak \" field approximation , they can not describe the experiments detecting the renormalization of the fermi velocity @xcite because these experiments are not in the landau - level , but in the shubnikov - de haas regime .    here",
    ", we investigate this problem within the pseudo - quantum electrodynamics ( pqed ) , which accounts for _ dynamical _ interactions , using a field - theoretical method .",
    "since pqed is a renormalizable theory , i.e. , the coupling constant is dimensionless , we use perturbation theory up to one - loop order to obtain the first correction to the fermionic propagator due to interactions , and under the presence of a weak external magnetic field .",
    "we show that in the weak - field approximation , we may separate the electron self - energy in two pieces : one at zero magnetic field , and another with a linear dependence on the field . focusing only on the @xmath1-field term ,",
    "through two different parametrizations , feynman s and schwinger s , we compute the contribution due to the magnetic field , which happens to be finite . within the renormalization group equations ,",
    "we show that the neither the weak magnetic field nor any finite contribution modify the renormalization of the fermi velocity .    the paper is divided as follow . in sec .",

    "the analysis of the renormalization group shows that a weak magnetic field has no additional effect in the renormalization of the fermi velocity , within linear order in @xmath1 . in this particular theory , because the photon field has null anomalous dimension , up to third - order in the coupling constant @xmath86 , no finite contributions coming from the electron self - energy can modify this renormalization .",

    "@xcite , through measurements of quantum capacitance , that the fermi velocity displays the same indistinguishable logarithmic renormalized behavior as a function of doping both in the absence or in the presence of a weak magnetic field .",
    "our results confirm that , from a theoretical perspective , this should be indeed the case .",
    "a simple analysis of the perturbation theory shows that our results hold also for high - order loops due to the fact that the theory is renormalizable .",
    "therefore , in the weak - field expansion , any contribution depending on the magnetic field @xmath1 would generate additional finite terms to the electron self - energy , which do not change the renormalization - group functions .    even though the weak magnetic field has no effect in the renormalization - group functions , finite temperatures could affect this renormalization .",
    "in addition , for stronger magnetic fields , it was shown theoretically using the schwinger - dyson equations that within the static approximation the interactions renormalize the fermi velocity with a factor that depends on the landau - level index @xcite .",
