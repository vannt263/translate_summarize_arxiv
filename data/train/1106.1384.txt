    "ss leporis ( hd 41511 ) contains an evolved m6 iii giant and an oversized a1 v star ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : param ] for a list of its known characteristics ) , and presents the so - called algol paradox , as the most evolved star is the least massive of the two , indicating mass reversal , through mass loss and mass accretion .",
    "the possibility that the system is indeed undergoing mass transfer is backed up by observations of regular outbursts @xcite as well as from the uv activity from the shell surrounding the a star @xcite , while the presence of a circumbinary dusty disc @xcite hints at the fact that the process is not conservative . in this sense , the recent observations of @xcite , indicating that the m star potentially fills its roche lobe , is of great value .",
    "we report here new interferometric observations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , obtained with the amber and pionier @xcite instruments attached to the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) .",
    "these observations allowed us to directly probe the most inner parts of ss lep , and to unambiguously determine its morphology at different epochs , giving rise to a refreshing view of this system . in this contribution , we focus our study on the binary system , determining its orbit as well as the m star diameter . we will finally show that the giant does not fill its roche lobe , in a strict sense .",
    ".[tab : param ] relevant parameters of the ss lep system , as previously determined or from this work : @xmath2 is the distance , @xmath3 the orbital period , @xmath4 the eccentricity , @xmath5 the inclination , and @xmath6 the mass function . for the stars , @xmath7 is the apparent diameter , and @xmath8 the mass .",
    "references : [ 1 ] @xcite ; [ 2 ] @xcite ; [ 3 ] @xcite . [ cols=\"<,>,^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      combining the orbital parameters with the binary mass function estimated by @xcite , we can estimate the individual mass of the stars , and , thus , the mass ratio .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in this estimate resides in the distance , as determined by hipparcos . using the distance and the angular separation of the two stars ,",
    "we obtain @xmath9au , and thus , through kepler s third law , the total mass of the system is estimated as @xmath10 .",
    "thanks to the inclination that we determined and to the binary mass function , we can derive the individual masses and the mass ratio : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "we measure a uniform disc diameter for the m star @xmath14mas .",
    "the previous vinci observations of @xcite led to a higher value of @xmath15mas , most likely because theirs was the result of a one - year survey of the source , without any phase information in the interferometric data .",
    "this involved to model the system as a symmetric object , and to mix up the interferometric signatures of the rotating binary with the resolved giant one .",
    "depending on the authors ( @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) , the conversion factor to a limb - darkened diameter differs by a few percents and we fix it to 1.04 .",
    "this leads to a limb - darkened diameter equal to @xmath16mas .",
    "our results is still in very good agreement with the limb - darkened diameter estimated from the sed of @xcite ( @xmath17mas ) .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty on the distance , the m giant radius is thus @xmath18 ( almost twice as small as previously thought ) , and the surface gravity is therefore @xmath19 .    .",
    "the limb - darkened diameter of the m giant is in dashed line , and the a star one is the dark dot .",
    "[ fig : rocheequipotential ] ]",
    "the circumbinary disc and the envelope around the a star , as well as the activity seen in the ultraviolet , are good hints for the occurrence of mass transfer .",
    "the disc additionally indicates that the process is not conservative . with the parameters derived above , we are able to show that , conversely to previous results , the m giant only fills about @xmath20 of its roche lobe ( fig . [",
    "fig : rocheequipotential ] ) , and the mass transfer is more likely due to the accretion of the m giant wind . if we assume the star s surface to follow an equipotential surface , we expect a tidal distortion of the giant from 5 to 7% .",
    "the wind speed being lower than the orbital one ( @xmath21kms@xmath22 ) the system is possibly in the particular case of a wind roche lobe overflow @xcite , where a substantial part of the stellar wind can be accreted . from the simulations of @xcite the wind accretion efficiency for these velocities is around 10% for a mass ratio equal to 1 .",
    "the accretor in ss lep being the most massive component , the efficiency could be significantly higher",
    ". however we do not expect that all the wind can be accreted because the circumbinary disc is a proof of the non conservative behaviour of the mass transfer process . assuming the m giant looses @xmath23yr@xmath22 @xcite through wind",
    ", the accretion rate onto the a star should be between @xmath24 and @xmath23yr@xmath22 .",
    "it is thinkable , however , that some enhanced mass loss takes place in such kind of systems , and this is possibly only a lower limit .",
    "this is still much lower than the value of @xmath25yr@xmath22 quoted by @xcite .",
    "we have presented here the results of our observations , and we focused on the binary . after having computed the characteristics of the orbit , we demonstrated that the mass ratio is lower than previously thought and that the m giant does not fill its roche lobe .",
    "however the system is in a configuration where a substantial part of the giant s stellar wind can be accreted by the a star .",
    "the refreshing and precise view of ss leporis given by these observations paves the way for the study of interacting binaries with interferometry , in combination with spectroscopic studies .",
    "the interferometric data also gave us information about the relative luminosity of the three components of the system ( the m and a stars , and the circumbinary disc ) .",
    "there is still some work to fully exploit these data .",
    "in particular , we lack a low resolution spectrum of ss lep between @xmath26 and @xmath27@xmath28 m to compute the absolute luminosity of each component and extract more specific information .",
    "the current data also present good hints of unmodeled material escaping the system .",
    "we plan to observe ss lep with the full high spatial resolution capacity of the vlt , with naco and pionier to study in more details the binary and the circumbinary disc , and extract as much information as possible about the mass transfer and the interactions .",
    "we also plan to use amber to observe the m giant wind and detect an asymmetry due to the high efficiency of its accretion onto the a star ."
