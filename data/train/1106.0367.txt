    "co emission surveys along the galactic plane reveal that molecular gas is abundant in the plane down to a galactocentric radius @xmath5 of @xmath6  kpc ( see e.g. , dame , hartmann , & thaddeus 2001 ) . inside this radius ,",
    "the amount of molecular emission greatly reduces , as do star formation activities .",
    "however , a significant amount of molecular gas , as well as various evidences of recent star formation , appears again inside @xmath5 of @xmath2  pc ( morris & serabyn 1996 , hereafter ms96 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter yz09 ) .",
    "this region of abundant molecular gas is called the central molecular zone ( cmz ) .",
    "the total gas mass inside @xmath7  pc is estimated to be @xmath8@xmath9 ( dahmen et al .",
    "1998 ; pierce - price et al .",
    "2000 ; launhardt , zylka , & mezger 2002 ) .",
    "the gas in the cmz must have migrated inward from the galactic disk through interactions with other clouds , field stars , and magnetic fields ( ms96 ) . a mixed atomic / molecular layer inside @xmath10  kpc turns into a mostly molecular , high - density medium at the cmz ( liszt & burton 1978 ; ms96 ) .",
    "binney et al . ( 1991 ) hypothesize that this abrupt change in gas content and density is caused by a transition between so - called @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbits near @xmath11  pc .",
    "@xmath0 is a family of stable , closed orbits elongated along the bar s major axis , whereas @xmath1 orbits are elongated along the bar s minor axis , much deeper in the potential ( contopoulos & papayannopoulos 1980 ) .",
    "the spiraling - in gas clouds would generally follow the @xmath0 orbits until the orbits become sharply cusped and even self - intersecting at the innermost @xmath0 region .",
    "gas clouds experience compression and shocks near the cusps of these orbits , lose angular momentum , and plunge to the @xmath1 orbits inside .",
    "the infalling gas clouds can additionally lose angular momentum when they collide with those already on the @xmath1 orbits .",
    "this compression and subsequent cooling will transform the gas into molecular form , and the molecular clouds accumulated in the @xmath1 region would correspond to the cmz .",
    "the abundance and high densities of molecular gas in the cmz naturally lead to star formation . indeed the cmz harbors two extraordinary , young ( few myr ) , massive ( a few @xmath12 ) star clusters , the arches and the quintuplet ( figer et al . 1999 ; kim et al .",
    "2006 , among others ) as well as a population of young stellar objects ( yz09 ) .",
    "serabyn & morris ( 1996 ) propose that star formation has been occurring in the cmz throughout the lifetime of the galaxy , and the resulting stellar population is evident as the central @xmath13 cluster or the nuclear bulge , a prominent cusp in the stellar density profile , whose extent is similar to that of the cmz .",
    "there have been a few numerical studies on the hydrodynamics of the gas layer in the galactic inner bulge .",
    "jenkins & binney ( 1994 ) examined the hypothesis of binney et al .",
    "( 1991 ) with two - dimensional ( 2d ) sticky particle simulations and confirmed that the transition of gas motion from @xmath0 to @xmath1 orbits indeed takes place in a bar potential .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and englmaier & gerhard ( 1999 ) were able to observe the same phenomenon in their 2d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",
    "rodriguez - fernandez & combes ( 2008 ) performed 2d hydrodynamic simulations ( particle motions followed in 3d ) with a more sophisticated potential model for the inner galaxy in an attempt to reproduce the observed velocity structure of the cmz . all these studies primarily concentrated on the behavior of the gas flows , and were not able to follow the density and temperature evolution of the gas clouds and subsequent star formation , due to the limits in their numerical schemes and/or computing power at those times .    in the present letter , we present 3d hydrodynamic simulations for the motions of gas clouds and star formation in the inner bulge of the galaxy .",
    "our simulations consider self - gravity , gas cooling and heating , and supernova ( sn ) feedback .",
    "we show that a bar potential can indeed compress and cool the gas sufficiently enough to form stars and that the obtained star formation rates ( sfrs ) are consistent with observations .",
    "we use a parallel @xmath14-body / sph code asura ( saitoh et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) for our simulations .",
    "we use an opening angle of @xmath15 for a cell opening and a softening length of 3  pc , and the kernel size of an sph particle is determined by imposing the number of neighbors to be @xmath16 .",
    "we implement a cooling function by spaans & norman ( 1997 ) for gas with a solar metallicity for a temperature range of 10@xmath17  k , and uniform heating from far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation is considered . the standard radiation strength used in our simulations",
    "is @xmath18 , is the habing field ( habing 1968 ) . ] which is @xmath19 times the solar neighborhood value ( the sfr per unit surface area in the cmz is @xmath19 times larger than that in the solar neighborhood ; yz09 ) .",
    "the effect of sn feedback is implemented by supplying thermal energy into the surrounding 32 gas particles .",
    "a star particle is spawned when a gas particle satisfies all of the following four conditions : 1 ) hydrogen number density is larger than the threshold density , @xmath20 , 2 ) temperature is lower than the threshold temperature , @xmath21 , 3 ) the flow is converging ( @xmath22 ) , and 4 ) there is no heat supply from nearby sn explosions .",
    "we adopt @xmath23  @xmath24 and @xmath25  k as our standard threshold values following saitoh et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) , who showed that only such a high density and low temperature threshold can reproduce the structural characteristics of galactic disks .",
    "the local sfr is assumed to be proportional to the local gas density divided by the local dynamical time , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) parameter , and we adopt @xmath28 as our standard value following saitoh et al .",
    "a newly spawned star particle is set to have one - third of the original gas particle mass .",
    "detailed discussion on the spawning of star particles and sn feedback is given in saitoh et al .",
    "following zhao , spergel , & rich ( 1994 ) , we adopt an @xmath29 bar with a power - law density profile for the inner galactic bulge : @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the associated legendre function .",
    "these are linear combinations of spherical harmonic functions of the @xmath33 , @xmath34,2 modes .",
    "@xmath35 determines the degree of oblateness / prolateness while @xmath36 determines the degree of non - axisymmetry .",
    "our standard simulation ( simulation 1 ) has the following parameters : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40  pc@xmath41 , @xmath42  pc , and a bar pattern speed of @xmath43 .",
    "this set of parameters gives a bar axis ratio of 1:0.74:0.65 for the isodensity surface that intersects points [ @xmath44 , @xmath45  pc , @xmath46 , an @xmath0@xmath1 transition at @xmath47  pc , inner lindblad resonance at 660  pc , and a corotation radius of 2.8  kpc .",
    "enclosed masses inside 200  pc and 1000  pc are @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "our simulations initially have gas particles only , which are distributed on @xmath0 orbits whose semi - minor axes range from 300 to 1200  pc .",
    "the number of particles on each orbit is proportional to the length of the orbit , and on a given orbit , particles are distributed over the same time - interval .",
    "the initial vertical distribution of the gas particles follows a gaussian function with a scale height of 40  pc .",
    "our standard simulation has @xmath50 gas particles and a total gas mass of @xmath51 , thus each gas particle initially has a mass of @xmath52 ( the latter is true for all of simulations , thus star particles in our simulations typically have @xmath53 ) .",
    "the initial velocities in the plane follow the motions on the @xmath0 orbits , while the vertical component is initially set to zero .",
    "we evolve such initial setup without cooling , heating , star formation , and sn feedback for the first 50  myr to obtain a hydrodynamically relaxed particle distribution .",

    "three snapshots of our standard simulation are presented in figure [ fig : snap01 ] for @xmath54 , 150 and 500  myr .",
    "the sense of galactic rotation in the snapshots is clockwise .",
    "the middle panel ( @xmath55  myr ) shows that gas particles near [ @xmath44 , @xmath56  pc ] quickly undergo shocks and compressed clouds plunge to the @xmath1 orbits along the `` dust lanes '' in the leading inner edges of the @xmath0 orbits .",
    "the gas accumulated on the @xmath1 orbits , i.e. , the cmz , initially forms an elongated ring of clouds at @xmath47  pc .",
    "the masses of gas clumps and streams in the cmz of our simulations , @xmath57@xmath58 , agree with those estimated for some clumps from radio observations ( e.g. , stark et al . 1991 ) .",
    "gas density is the highest in this ring , and this is where star formation is the most active .",
    "the right panel ( @xmath59  myr ) shows that as the gas infall and star formation in the nuclear ring continue , the radial distribution of gas and stars in the @xmath1 region broadens ( mostly inward region . ] ) .",
    "however , star formation still takes place mostly near @xmath47  pc , because newly infalling gas from the dust lanes collides the existing nuclear ring of gas at its outer rim .",
    "we note that only @xmath60 of the gas flowing down the dust lanes directly enters the cmz , while the rest flows back to the @xmath0 region .",
    "this fraction is consistent with that found in regan , vogel , & teuben ( 1997 ; 1025  % ) .",
    "evolutions of gas , stellar , and total masses on @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbits are shown in figure [ fig : mass01 ] .",
    "the mass transfer from @xmath0 to @xmath1 regions takes place quite rapidly between @xmath61 and @xmath62  myr and then goes into a slower , stable phase ( panel _ a _ ) .",
    "while the total mass in the @xmath1 region grows nearly constantly after @xmath63  myr , the gas mass in the @xmath1 region , @xmath64 , is held at a nearly constant value and then decreases very slowly ( panel _ b _ ) .",
    "this implies that star formation in the @xmath1 region becomes so efficient that all of the newly supplied gas turns into stars once the gas mass in the @xmath1 region reaches a certain critical value ( @xmath65 ) at @xmath62  myr .",
    "both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 regions initially ( @xmath66  myr ) have high sfrs ( see panel _ d _ ) , but this is because when the star formation takes place for the first time ( @xmath67  myr for the @xmath0 region , @xmath68  myr for the @xmath1 region ) , there is no or not enough sn feedback that regulates star formation .",
    "thus this initial relaxation period should be disregarded if one assumes a continuous gas supply from the outer region ( an intermittent gas supply may result in a repetition of a brief , high - sfr phase followed by a longer , lower - sfr phase ) .",
    "while the sfr in the @xmath0 region continuously decreases as the amount of gas there becomes depleted , the sfr in the @xmath1 region becomes quite stationary after the initial relaxation period , and ranges between 0.04 and @xmath69 .",
    "this range is in excellent agreement with recent sfrs estimated for the cmz from mid - infrared observations by yz09 , 0.01@xmath70  yr@xmath71 .",
    "simulation 1 clearly shows that 1 ) under a bar potential modeled for the inner bulge of the milky way , gas inflow along the galactic plane leads to the formation of a gas ring , whose radial extent is consistent with the cmz , and 2 ) the gas ring has high enough densities to form stars at a rate consistent with observed values .",
    "the parameters of our potential model ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) were chosen such that the transition between @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbits appears at @xmath2  pc , therefore the extent of the gas ring in our simulation is a result of the potential parameters that we chose .",
    "on the other hand , it is reasonable to expect that the sfr in the cmz is determined by the gas influx rate from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 regions , and that this influx rate is dependent on the initial gas surface density ( or initial gas mass ) in the @xmath0 region .",
    "the fact that the sfr from simulation 1 is consistent with the observed values implies that the adopted initial gas mass in our @xmath0 region ( major axes from 300 to 1200  pc ) properly reproduces the actual gas influx rate from the @xmath0 to @xmath1 regions in the gc .",
    "however , the average @xmath64 after relaxation ( @xmath75  myr ) in simulation 1 , @xmath76 , is 20  % to four times smaller than the estimated @xmath64 values from various observations , @xmath8@xmath77 ( the largest mass estimate is derived from dust emission and is sensitive to the assumed dust temperature in the gc , while the smallest estimate is obtained from c@xmath78o molecular line emission ; see section [ sec : intro ] for references ) .    to see the dependence of @xmath64 on initial @xmath79 , we performed simulation 2 , which starts with a twice as large initial @xmath79 than simulation 1 .",
    "simulation 2 indeed results in @xmath80 times larger sfrs than simulation 1 as expected , and @xmath81 times larger @xmath64 ( see table [ table : sim ] ) .",
    "now , not only the sfr but also @xmath64 is consistent with observations .",
    "note that the cmz mass is not as sensitive to the gas influx rate as the sfr is .",
    "simulation 3 , whose sfe parameter ( @xmath27 ) is 10 times smaller than simulation 1 in consideration of the extreme star formation environment in the gc such as strong tidal forces / magnetic fields and elevated gas temperatures , shows another way to increase @xmath64it gives @xmath82  % smaller sfr , but @xmath83  % larger @xmath64 ( @xmath84 ) than simulation 1 .",
    "the increase in @xmath64 is due to the fact that the star formation in the cmz now requires higher gas densities than in simulation 1 to compensate for the lowered @xmath27 in equation ( [ sfr ] ) . from our experiments with simulations 1 through 3",
    ", we conclude that one can fit the observed gas mass and sfr in the cmz simultaneously by controlling the gas influx rate from the outer bulge ( i.e. , initial @xmath79 in our simulations ) and the sfe ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the actual sfr in the whole @xmath0 region of the milky way is not known yet , as no systematic observations have been made for the region .",
    "simulations 1 through 3 show some star formation in the @xmath0 region , but it is not possible to accurately calculate steady - state sfrs in the @xmath0 region from these simulations , because our simulations do not have continuous gas supply from the outer bulge .",
    "the total sfrs in the @xmath0 region of simulations 1 through 3 are only fractions of those in the @xmath1 region , implying that the sfr per unit volume is much higher in the @xmath1 region ( the volume occupied by the @xmath0 orbits is @xmath85 times larger than that occupied by the @xmath1 orbits in these simulations ) .    in many nuclear starburst galaxies ,",
    "star formation takes the form of a ring , i.e. , a nuclear star - forming ring .",
    "if the milky way is such a case , star formation in the inner bulge would be confined in the cmz and there should be no or very little star formation taking place outside the cmz .",
    "we find from simulation 4 that one way to achieve this is to impose a higher fuv radiation field .",
    "simulation 4 , whose @xmath86 is 10 times larger than simulation 1 , gives nearly the same gas mass and sfr in the @xmath1 region as simulation 1 , but almost entirely suppresses star formation in the @xmath0 region ( see figure [ fig : mass04 ] ) .",
    "it is not certain whether the radiation strength in the inner bulge can actually reach as high as @xmath87 , but other physical mechanisms that can quench star formation in the gc , but are not considered in our simulations , such as strong tidal forces and magnetic fields , may also contribute to the suppression of star formation in the @xmath0 region as seen in simulation 4 .    our star formation and sn feedback models",
    "successfully reproduce the kennicutt - schmidt ( k - s ) relation . at @xmath88  myr , the cmz in simulation 1 has a gas surface density of @xmath89 and a surface sfr of @xmath90 , the latter of which is 0.45 dex higher than the mean k - s relation , whereas the cmz in simulation 3 has a surface sfr that is 0.12 dex higher than the mean k - s relation . considering a rather large scatter in observed sfrs around a mean k - s relation ( rms scatter @xmath91 dex ; kennicutt 1998 ) , the sfrs from our simulations are consistent with the k - s relation .",
    "if the star formation in the inner bulge of the milky way is indeed confined in the cmz , and if it has been sustained for the lifetime of the galaxy as suggested by figer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the resulting stellar population should manifest in a certain way .",
    "indeed , the infrared intensity profiles in the gc have revealed a prominent , central stellar cusp with an outer extent of about 0.7 deg ( @xmath92  pc ) on top of the shallower profile made by the galactic bulge ( serabyn & morris 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "serabyn & morris propose that this ` nuclear bulge ' is the resulting stellar population from the sustained star formation in the cmz .",
    "the extent of the nuclear bulge is somewhat smaller than that of the cmz , and this may indicate that the radius of the cmz was smaller in the past . from our further simulations with various density slopes ( @xmath74 ) and bar elogations ( @xmath36 ) , we find that a smaller cmz radius can be obtained when the density profile is shallower ( @xmath93 ; the same amount of orbital energy loss at the cusps of @xmath0 orbits will plunge the gas further inside ) , or when the bar is more elongated ( @xmath94 ; the gas at the cusps of @xmath0 orbits will lose larger orbital energy ) .",
    "therefore , the relatively smaller size of the nuclear bulge may be an important clue on the secular evolution of the galactic center .",
    "some of the accumulated gas in the cmz will keep migrating inward and reach the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) of molecular clouds at @xmath955  pc , and a part of it will sink further to form stars in the central parsec or feed the central supermassive black hole . one possible way to transfer gas from the cmz to the cnd would be a ` nested bar , ' as examined by namekata et al .",
