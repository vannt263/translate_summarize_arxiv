    "active galaxies can be classified in many ways , according to spectrum , luminosity , and morphology , and the result is a confused taxonomy that only partly reflects the underlying physics .",
    "this situation has led to  unification theories \" in which various categories are linked by orientation , evolution or a gradient in physical characteristics .",
    "( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the one that concerns us in this paper connects type 1 ( broad - line ) and type 2 ( narrow - line ) objects by aspect . in this picture an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) contains a bright continuum source and a broad - line region ( blr ) surrounded by a dusty torus .",
    "when viewed from near the pole the center is visible and a type 1 object is seen , whereas along the equator the view of the center is blocked by the torus , and a type 2 object is seen .",
    "when the conditions are right the nuclear light ( continuum and broad lines ) escaping along the poles can be scattered and thus polarized , and seen by the observer .",
    "miller and his collaborators ( @xcite ) , with the aid of spectropolarimetry , showed that many seyfert 2 galaxies do contain a hidden blr , and a detailed investigation of the seyfert 2 ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) showed that the scattered light is typical of a seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "thus unification by aspect is proven for many seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies . @xcite surveyed seyfert 2 s selected by fir fluxes and colors , which supposedly are isotropic quantities , and showed that at least 7 of 16 objects contain a hidden blr .",
    "also , infrared observations that penetrate the dust and see the blr have shown directly that some type 2 seyferts have broad line regions ( @xcite ) .    in this paper our interest centers on the powerful fr ii radio galaxies ( rg ) , and on radio - loud qso s ( quasars ) .",
    "like seyferts , the rg come in types 1 and 2 ( blrg and nlrg , respectively ) , and there has been interest in seeing if they also can be unified by aspect .",
    "they have the further virtue of containing a radio jet that presumably marks the dynamical axis of the black hole and accretion disk , providing additional geometric information .",
    "quasars and rg are obviously anisotropic at radio wavelengths , and the viewing aspect has long been a major factor in their unification ( e.g .. @xcite ) .",
    "the common deficit of observed ionizing photons relative to those seen by the line - emitting regions ( e.g. @xcite ) shows that rg also must be anisotropic at optical and uv wavelengths .",
    "a statistical basis for unifying rg and quasars was provided by @xcite , who used the opaque torus scenario developed for seyferts .",
    "barthel postulated that most fr ii rg and quasars are similar , and contain a continuum source and blr inside an opaque torus .",
    "quasars are seen within about 45 degrees of the pole where there is a direct view into the center , and rg are seen at higher inclinations where the quasar is partially or entirely hidden .",
    "blazars are seen when the line of sight ( los ) is close to the axis , and the rapid variability in flux and polarization due to variations in beamed synchrotron radiation can be seen .",
    "many observations have now shown that much of this scenario must be correct .",
    "broad h@xmath0 has been seen in the polarized light from the nlrg 3c 234 ( e.g. @xcite , hereafter t95 ) , 3c 321 ( @xcite ) , and cygnus a ( @xcite , hereafter o97 ) .",
    "in all three objects an estimate of luminosity is consistent with their being off - axis quasars .",
    "imaging polarimetry shows that in some rg the polarized regions have the azimuthal symmetry of a reflection nebula , as expected from an extended scattering region illuminated by a point source ( @xcite , o97 , @xcite ) .",
    "also , as with seyferts , broad ir lines have been seen in a number of nlrg .",
    "@xcite found broad p@xmath0 in 4 of 9 nlrg that they surveyed , indicating that some nlrg contain a blr hidden by dust , and would be called quasars if seen from a dust - free direction .",
    "another aspect of unification is the  alignment effect \" , the tendency of galactic extended emission line regions ( eelr ) to lie along the radio axis ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "at least part of the explanation involves an agn in which the radio axis , the dusty torus , and the photoionization cones are all roughly coaxial . this picture is generally confirmed with polarimetry , which shows that the reflection nebula is spatially coincident with the eelr .",
    "jet - induced star formation might also contribute to the alignment effect ( e.g. @xcite ) . in 1994",
    "we started a program of spectropolarimetric observations of powerful radio galaxies , to study unification and the alignment effect , and to study the geometry and kinematics of the agn .",
    "we have already reported on 8 objects : pks 0116 + 082 , 3c 234 , fsc 10214 + 4724 , 3c 265 , 3c 277.2 , 3c 324 , 3c 343.1 , and cygnus a. ( @xcite , t95 , @xcite , @xcite , o97 ) in this paper we give the combined results for the 13 objects for which @xmath1 ; i.e .. , those in which h@xmath0 is available , and discuss the polarimetry , unification , geometric effects , and the continuum radiation . in general we assume that the scattering is due to dust , which undoubtedly is present , at least near the nucleus , because of the observed extinction .",
    "the relative importance of electron and dust scattering is undetermined , since dust can mimic electrons in producing wavelength - independent scattering in the optical band .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our sample of fr ii galaxies ,  3 gives some observational details , and  4 and  5 give a general view of the results .",
    "section 6 presents a model for the continuum radiation for blrg .",
    "details of individual objects are in  7 and  8 . in  9",
    "we discuss the rotations in @xmath2 ( polarization position angle ) observed in 3c 227 and 3c 445 .",
    "section 10 contains further discussions of direct vs scattered light , unification , and radio - optical connections .",
    "we choose @xmath3 and @xmath4 for all calculations .",
    "we shall make use of both the full stokes parameters @xmath5 and the normalized parameters @xmath6 ; the use of upper and lower case letters should minimize any confusion .",
    "we have been measuring the polarimetric properties of radio galaxies with the 10-m w.m .",
    "keck telescopes , and define those in which h@xmath0 is visible as the  low - z sample \" . to this keck group we add two objects observed with the 5-m hale telescope at palomar observatory .",
    "the total sample , listed in table 1 , comprises 13 fr ii rg with @xmath1  5 blrg and 8 nlrg .",
    "3c 234 is often called a blrg because broad h@xmath0 is readily seen in f@xmath7 , but we list it with the nlrg because the broad line is predominantly composed of scattered light ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "column 6 of table 1 gives an estimate of an upper limit to the interstellar polarization ( isp ) towards each source .",
    "this value is obtained by estimating the extinction towards each object from the maps prepared by @xcite , and using the empirical formula @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "cygnus a is at low latitude and is discussed by @xcite ; see also o97 .",
    "the isp effects are small in this case .",
    "possible isp effects in 3c 33 , 3c 195 , and fsc 2217 + 295 are discussed in  8 and  9 .",
    "references to previous polarimetric work are in column 7 of table 1 .",
    "our sample is not an approximation to a flux - limited or volume - limited sample , as most of the objects were chosen because they were known to be polarized .",
    "3c 105 and 3c 135 were observed because they are fr ii rg that fitted into a slot in the observing schedule .",
    "3c 357 was observed because its hst image ( @xcite ) shows an off - nuclear emission region that we thought might be polarimetrically interesting .",
    "we shall make use of work by h96 who observed p@xmath0 in a complete sample of 11 rg ( see  10.2 ) , 3 of which are also in our sample .",
    "this will give our results more generality than they would have by themselves .",
    "the keck observations were made with the polarimetry module ( @xcite ) in the low - resolution imaging spectroscope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the polarimeter contains a rotatable half - wave plate and a calcite beamsplitter .",
    "the stokes parameters are measured by taking 4 exposures at waveplate position angles ( pa ) of @xmath9 , and combining the spectra with the standard self - calibration procedure ( @xcite ) , using the computer reduction system vista . at each epoch",
    "we observed standard polarized stars and standard null stars as a check on the system and to establish the reference for pa determinations .",
    "the standard stars are taken from the lists of @xcite or have been referenced back to that list by our own measurements with the keck polarimeter .",
    "the relative accuracy in pa determinations is about 0.5 .",
    "the pa calibration is discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "for spectroscopy we used a grating with 300 g / mm , blazed at 5000  .",
    "this gives a dispersion of @xmath10   per pixel and a resolution of @xmath11  .",
    "the wavelength coverage was typically 3900    to 8900   .",
    "the slit was @xmath12 wide , except where noted in table 2 .",
    "we did not observe with an order - blocking filter .",
    "in most cases the spectra are flat or rise to the red , and errors due to second - order light are negligible .",
    "we did observe the flux standards with and without the order - blocking filter , as most of them are hot white dwarfs and the flux calibration would otherwise have been in error .    for imaging we replaced the grating by a mirror and inserted a b - band filter into the beam .",
    "the scale is @xmath13 per pixel .",
    "the imaging polarimetry procedure is the same as for spectroscopy , with the simplification that there is no spectral extraction .",
    "when necessary for either spectroscopy or imaging we improved the s / n by binning the fluxes rather than by averaging the stokes parameters themselves , which can lead to bias ( @xcite ) .",
    "we typically took 15-minute exposures so that a full 4-exposure set took an hour plus readout time .",
    "the field of view of the keck polarimeter is about @xmath14 .",
    "this limits the useful length of the slit for spectroscopy , and for all observations it can make sky subtraction difficult , as some galaxies nearly fill the field . in such a case the apparent polarization @xmath15 may be higher than the value a larger field would have given ; this is analogous to increasing @xmath15 for a nuclear source by narrowing the slit and allowing less diluting starlight into the the measurement .",
    "at palomar we used the double spectrograph ( @xcite ) to do spectropolarimetry , but not imaging polarimetry , on the 5-m hale telescope .",
    "the polarimeter is similar to that used at keck ( @xcite ) . in the red camera",
    "the grating has 158 g / mm and dispersion approximately 6   per pixel , and in the blue camera the grating has 316 g / mm giving approximately 2.1   per pixel .",
    "calibration and data reductions were done in a fashion similar to those used at keck .",
    "table 2 gives the log of all the observations .",
    "the imaging observations on 1995 december 16 were compromised by poor seeing that ranged up to @xmath16 .",
    "we reobserved 3c 195 and 3c 234 on 1996 april 16 and only the later data are included in this paper .",
    "four rg , pks 0116 + 082 , 3c 109 , 3c 227 and fsc 2217 + 259 , were observed only in december 1995 , and those data are included here except for pks 0116 + 082 , which was presented in cohen et al .",
    "the high and variable seeing compromises the angular resolution , but does not further affect the polarization observations .",
    "we display the combined spectropolarimetry results in figures 1 and 2 , where the objects are arrayed , roughly , in order of decreasing visibility of the broad h@xmath0 line in f@xmath7 . in figure 1",
    "the left panels show the total flux f@xmath7 and the right panels show the  polarized flux \" defined as @xmath17 .",
    "this quantity is sometimes called the  stokes flux \" , and in simple cases it is proportional to the scattered flux .",
    "the spectra of f@xmath7 and @xmath18 are shown on a logarithmic scale .",
    "note that corresponding plots in figure 1 have the same logarithmic range , so that the relative enhancement of h@xmath0 can be more readily assessed .",
    "figure 2a shows the fractional linear polarization @xmath15 and figure 2b shows the polarization position angle @xmath2 .",
    "when the s / n is high ( @xmath19 ) we can estimate @xmath15 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the normalized stokes parameters and @xmath23 is the error in @xmath21 or @xmath22 calculated from photon statistics and the normal propagation of errors ( @xcite ) . in most cases",
    ", however , s / n is not that high , especially at the blue end of the spectrum . instead of attempting to debias the square - root , we prefer to rotate @xmath21 and @xmath22 by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a smooth approximation to the measured @xmath2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath26 is a useful estimate of @xmath15 .",
    "hereafter we use the symbol @xmath15 for all estimates of the polarization .    in figures 1 and 2",
    "we show spectra for 3c 109 , 3c 234 and cyg a that have been published before ( @xcite , hereafter g92 ; t95 , o97 ) and are repeated here to give a more complete impression of the range of possible behaviors .",
    "3c 105 had no measurable polarization and spectra for it are shown in  8.3 .",
    "the polarization of 3c 357 is particularly noisy and it is omitted from figures 1 and 2 but is shown in figure 3 and discussed in  8.7 .",
    "generally the spectra are for a region centered on the nucleus , except for 3c 33 where the extraction window was centered on a strongly - polarized region approximately 3   north - east of the nucleus , and 3c 357 where the window is approximately 1.5   west of the nucleus .",
    "the length of the window is given in table 3 , which gives some results from the polarimetry .",
    "the averaging interval , 5400  5600  , contains no strong emission lines , so the values of @xmath15 and @xmath2 represent , approximately , the v - band continuum polarization .",
    "however , we show in  5.2 that many of the nlrg contain reflection nebulae , in which @xmath2 varies with position . in these objects",
    "the measured @xmath2 may depend on the location of the slit and the extraction window .    for most objects an elliptical galaxy template was fit to the absorption features and subtracted from f@xmath7 to get the  corrected flux \" f@xmath27 .",
    "the corrected polarization @xmath28 is in table 3 .",
    "we used ngc 6702 as the template galaxy except for 3c 234 and cyg a where ngc 821 was used .",
    "two blrg , 3c 382 and 3c 445 , have so little starlight that we were unable to determine an accurate galaxy component other than @xmath29 .",
    "we were unable to fit 3c 109 properly , but the absorption lines are weak and the galaxy fraction must be small .",
    "figure 3 shows curves of f@xmath30 and @xmath31 for 7 objects ; those for 3c 234 and cygnus a have already been published ( t95 , o97 ) .    at this point",
    "we discuss the main features of figures 1 - 3 .",
    "details will be presented in later sections .",
    "it has been customary to define a broad - line radio galaxy merely as one that has prominent broad lines , e.g. the balmer series , that are substantially broader than the forbidden lines e.g. [ oiii ] .",
    "this simple definition , however , takes no account of equivalent widths , and is subject to the vagaries of observation and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "further , it does not allow for differing geometric or physical circumstances . in figure 1a , 3c  234 shows prominent broad h@xmath0 and easily seen broad h@xmath32 .",
    "these lines were noted long ago and thus 3c 234 is usually called a blrg ( @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that the broad lines are noticeably weaker than those in the top 5 galaxies in figure 1a , and 3c 234 has also been called an nlrg .",
    "@xcite argue by analogy with the type 2 seyfert ngc 1068 that the broad lines are polarized like the continuum and are predominantly due to scattered light , and that 3c 234 should be called a type 2 object ( see also t95 ) .",
    "we agree that the broad lines are mainly due to scattering , because broad h@xmath0 and h@xmath32 are more prominent in @xmath33 than in f@xmath7 .",
    "thus we discuss 3c 234 with the nlrg . however , it is intermediate between type 1 and type 2 objects , and has other differences from the blrg and nlrg in addition to the intermediate equivalent width of the broad lines .",
    "we discuss this in  8.5 .      in figure 1a the blrg",
    "have been arrayed in order of decreasing visibility of broad h@xmath0 , but it can be seen that the order is also one of increasing redness and @xmath15 .",
    "3c 382 has a blue quasar spectrum and is weakly polarized ; fsc 2217 + 259 is a red iras galaxy and is highly polarized .",
    "the correlations are shown in figure 7 , along with calculations made with a simple model which is presented in  6 . briefly , the model assumes that the blrg continuum ( after starlight subtraction ) is a combination of two components , a nearly unpolarized @xmath34 ray that has a view of the nuclear continuum source and blr but has extinction and reddening due to dust , and a highly polarized @xmath35 ray that has less reddening .",
    "the net polarization increases as the ratio of scattered to direct radiation increases , so the direct ray bluens the polarization and reddens the total flux .",
    "this model is similar to the one used by @xcite for iras 13349 + 2438 .",
    "application to individual objects is given in  7 .",
    "the continuum model can not be used for the nlrg because they have an additional important component of radiation .",
    "most of the nlrg , along with many seyfert 2 galaxies , have broad lines that are more highly polarized than the neighboring continuum , even after the subtraction of starlight ( figure  3b ) .",
    "this led tran ( 1995 ) to consider two featureless continuum components ; the first , fc1 , is due to scattering and is polarized , while the other , fc2 , is assumed to be unpolarized .",
    "fc2 differentially dilutes the continuum and h@xmath0 ; this leaves @xmath36 .",
    "the relative levels of fc1 and fc2 can be estimated by requiring the broad h@xmath0 emission line to have the same intrinsic polarization as the neighboring fc1 .",
    "this is useful if it can plausibly be maintained that the agn light ( continuum and broad lines ) is all polarized at the same level , by scattering .",
    "we think that this is a conservative assumption , as it is unlikely that the broad lines could be intrinsically more polarized than the nuclear continuum .",
    "they surely come from a larger region ( @xcite ) , and are more likely to be intrinsically polarized less than the continuum , as in 3c 382 ( see also @xcite ) .    in 3c 234",
    "the decomposition into fc1 and fc2 ( t95 ) showed that the continuum may consist of three components in addition to unpolarized starlight : balmer nebular continuum radiation from the nlr , nuclear light in which the continuum and broad lines are polarized the same ( fc1 ) , and an fc2 whose origin is unclear .",
    "the reliability of this model was enhanced when it turned out that broad h@xmath32 had the same @xmath15 as its neighboring fc1 , even though h@xmath32 was not used in the construction .",
    "cygnus a yields a similar result ( o97 ) , and in this case fc2 can be interpreted as diluting radiation from hot young stars ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "nearly every object has @xmath15 rising to the blue ( figure 2a ) . for most objects",
    "this is mainly due to the reduction of dilution of @xmath15 by unpolarized light from an old stellar population .",
    "( this point has been made numerous times ; see e.g. t95 , and @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally said that most low - z rg have low @xmath15 whereas most high - z rg have high @xmath15 , and that this is due to the different rest - wavelength ranges covered at low and high z. figure 2 shows this wavelength dependence : at 5500   all but 3c 109 , fsc 2217 + 259 and 3c234 have @xmath37 , whereas below 4000   all but 3c 382 , 3c 445 and 3c 135 have @xmath38 .",
    "however , figure 3b shows that @xmath31 still rises to the blue in most objects .",
    "as remarked above , this could be caused by another diluting component ; e.g. a reddened direct ray or fc2 .",
    "the rise of @xmath31 to the blue , especially in the uv , means that the polarized flux @xmath33 has a steeper spectrum than the galaxy - corrected flux f@xmath30 . in @xmath39 3c 382 and 3c",
    "321 both have an index @xmath40 ( f@xmath41 ) , at least blueward of h@xmath0 .",
    "this is part of the evidence that 3c 321 , an nlrg , has a quasar - like central continuum source .",
    "see  8.6 .",
    "the position angle @xmath2 ( figure 2b ) is remarkably constant in many of the objects . in fsc 2217 + 259 , for example ,",
    "a linear fit to @xmath2 gives a slope @xmath42  which is at most @xmath43 across the spectrum . in 3c 234",
    "a similar fit gives a change @xmath44 across the spectrum .",
    "in these objects there can be little polarization by intervening dust extinction , either in our galaxy or the host galaxy , because @xmath15 itself changes strongly with wavelength and the observed @xmath2 would rotate noticeably , unless there were a fortuitous alignment of position angles . a few objects do have a significant rotation in the position angle of the continuum .",
    "the two objects with double nuclei have large rotations ; 3c 321 rotates @xmath45 between 3550    and 7000   , and cygnus a has @xmath46 .",
    "the cygnus a rotation is explained with three components of continuum radiation , with different @xmath15 s and @xmath2 s , that combine to give the observed values ( o97 ) .      in all the polarized nlrg except 3c 357 , @xmath15 rises in broad h@xmath0 ( figure 2a ) .",
    "this is due to differential dilution by starlight and other components .",
    "it is this increase in @xmath15 that makes broad h@xmath0 more prominent in the polarized flux @xmath47 than in @xmath48 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "3c 357w is the only polarized object that does not show broad lines .",
    "however , this object is faint and the telluric a band falls on the red wing of h@xmath0 , so this result is inconclusive ( see  8.7 ) .",
    "3c 382 is different from the other blrg as it has a quasar spectrum , with a weakly polarized continuum and little or no starlight or narrow lines .",
    "broad h@xmath0 and h@xmath32 are weak in @xmath49 , and are nearly unpolarized .",
    "weak polarization of the broad lines relative to the continuum is typical of quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sequence in figure 1b shows that broad h@xmath0 is similar in polarized flux from 3c 227 to at least 3c 33 . in these cases",
    "the polarized flux is giving us a look deep into the interior of the object , by scattering .",
    "we also see the interior of the blrg directly , but with extinction ( see  6 ) .",
    "this may be true also for 3c 234 ( t95 ) . in 3c 234 , and in some of the blrg , the los is probably near the edge of the obscuring torus .",
    "we suspect that the torus does not have a sharp boundary , and that there is a range of inclinations where the interior can be seen through dust .      in general",
    "the narrow lines are only weakly polarized .",
    "this is readily seen in figure 2a , where many objects show strong reductions in @xmath15 at the locations of the narrow lines .",
    "this is most striking in 3c 234 where more than a dozen narrow lines show the effect strongly .",
    "narrow h@xmath0 shows up prominently as a reduction in @xmath15 in 3c 234 , 3c 33ne , and 3c 195 because these are the objects that are dominated by narrow lines in total flux but by broad lines in polarized flux .",
    "all the objects except 3c 109 , 3c 234 , and 3c 382 show narrow emission lines in @xmath49 ( figure 1b ) , so these lines are polarized but at a low level .",
    "the possible polarization of the [ o  iii ] lines in 3c 109 is discussed in g92 .",
    "weakly polarized [ o  iii]@xmath50 is seen in most objects , several objects show polarized narrow h@xmath0 , and cyg a shows several other species .",
    "[ o  ii]@xmath51 is not reliably identified in any of the @xmath49 spectra , and is essentially unpolarized",
    ". the origin of [ o  ii ] must be at or outside the scattering region , whereas the other narrow lines arise from deeper locations and are partly seen by scattering .",
    "the possible anisotropy of [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] and its interpretation in terms of unified agn models has been discussed by e.g. @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we took polarimetric images of 11 objects ( table 2 ) .",
    "earlier observations of this type are referenced in table 1 .",
    "our current work shows that the polarization images fall into two main classes , those with compact and those with extended polarized regions .",
    "there is a strong correlation between this image class and the spectral classification : the blrg are compact and the nlrg are extended .      the compact systems are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the innermost contour is 50% of the peak for every object , and except for fsc 2217 + 259 the next contour is 5% of the peak ( see the caption ) .",
    "all the objects except fsc 2217 + 259 have @xmath52 , consistent with seeing .",
    "3c 109 and 3c 227 have been called  n \" galaxies ( @xcite ) , indicating that they contain a brilliant point - like nucleus .",
    "other n galaxies in our sample include 3c 135 and 3c 234 , shown in figures 5 and 6 , and 3c 445 , for which we have no imaging data .",
    "3c 382 has a strong nucleus although apparently it was not called an n system . in ",
    "7.4 we give evidence that it was exceptionally bright at our epoch .",
    "3c 382 , 3c 109 , and 3c 227 are closely similar .",
    "the galaxies are dominated by a bright point source at the nucleus , and the polarization patterns are simple .",
    "the vectors are roughly parallel and decrease radially by a small amount  a factor of 0.8 in 3c 109 and 3c 382 , and 0.6 in 3c 227 .",
    "these patterns can be explained with a polarized point source broadened by seeing and diluted by galaxian starlight and by spatial averaging .",
    "there is no need to invoke scattering by an extended distribution of dust or electrons to explain the observations .",
    "fsc 2217 + 259 is highly polarized and consequently has high s / n .",
    "the vectors are accurately parallel and decrease radially by a factor of two or three .",
    "it is similar to the other blrg and the polarization pattern could again be due to seeing plus dilution , although the angular extent is greater than for the others and scattering in an extended medium may also play a role .",

    "a central source illuminates material in a bicone , and the scattered light is polarized perpendicular to the plane of scattering .",

    "the polarization is weak at the nucleus , and has a strong radial gradient .",
    "the sign of the gradient is opposite to that for the blrg , where @xmath15 decreases with radius .",
    "the gradient must be partly due to dilution by unpolarized starlight , which is more strongly concentrated to the nucleus than is the scattering material .",
    "however , the effect is also seen in 3c 265 with z=0.811 ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the polarization image was measured in the rest - frame uv , and dilution by an old stellar population would have had little importance . seeing and spatial averaging",
    "also affect the pattern , but they generally act to reduce the gradient .",
    "three of the four objects in figure 5 and also cyg a ( o97 ) ; i.e. all the strongly polarized nlrg except for 3c 234 , have separated peaks in @xmath17 . since starlight is unpolarized it has no effect on @xmath17 and we must look elsewhere for the cause .",
    "we suggest it is due to the presumed geometry , an illuminated cone whose apex is shielded by an opaque torus . near the apex",
    "the resolution element is larger than the cone and the vector sum of the polarizations is reduced because they have a variety of angles , all perpendicular to the radius .",
    "the central decrease could also be caused by obscuration of the polarized light .",
    "3c 234 is special .",
    "the polarization pattern is extended but does not show fans , and @xmath15 has a steady ew gradient with a peak east of the flux peak .",
    "@xmath17 has a maximum at the center .",
    "this pattern is different from both the blrg and the nlrg .",
    "the vectors show a tendency for circular symmetry , although not as strongly as the other objects , and the pattern may be due to scattering of nuclear light .",
    "this is discussed further in  8.5 .",
    "in this section we first discuss the spectral index and balmer decrement for the blrg in terms of one reddening screen , and then present a two - component model that also attempts to explain the polarization . in  7 the results are applied to the individual sources .",
    "assume that there is a dust screen in front of the blrg which produces the same extinction in the continuum and the lines .",
    "then we have two measures of reddening : the ratio of broad h@xmath0 to broad h@xmath32 , and the ratio of the continuum fluxes at h@xmath0 and h@xmath32 .",
    "the data plotted in figure 7a show that these quantities are correlated .",
    "they have been corrected for galactic reddening , and 3c 227 , 3c 234 , and fsc 2217 + 259 have been corrected for an old stellar population ( the other objects have @xmath55 ) . the continuum spectral index @xmath0 between h@xmath0 and h@xmath32 is shown in the top scale . in",
    "fig 7 the order of the objects ( left to right ) is the same as the vertical order in figure 1 except that galactic dereddening has moved 3c 109 to the left of 3c 445 .",
    "baker ( 1997 , fig .",
    "16 ) shows a similar diagram for radio - loud quasars .",
    "the range of balmer decrement in figure 7a is about the same as in baker , but fsc 2217 + 259 has a considerably redder spectrum than any of her quasars .",
    "four of the five blrg ( excluding 3c 109 ) form a sequence that is parametric in reddening .",
    "we model this relationship by assuming that the intrinsic balmer decrement of the broad - line clouds is 3.0 ( case b ) .",
    "the reddening line for this model depends on the intrinsic spectral index @xmath56 of the continuum source , and in figure 7a we plot solid lines for @xmath57 .",
    "the great majority of quasar indices fall within this range ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dotted lines show extinction @xmath58 in magnitudes , calculated with the @xcite extinction law with @xmath59 .    the model can be adapted to all the blrg except 3c 109 .",
    "however , radio loud quasars ( excluding css sources ) appear to have dereddened intrinsic indices close to 0.5 ( @xcite ) , and fsc 2217 + 259 lies rather far from that value",
    ". it may be that it has an exceptional index , but it may also be that the model is too simple in assuming that the extinction is the same for both the continuum and broad lines .",
    "if the extinction to the blr were more than to the continuum source , then fsc 2217 + 259 could be accommodated with an index near 0.5 .",
    "indeed , the extra extinction could be associated with the blr itself . for",
    "a discussion of dust in the blr see e.g. @xcite .",
    "another alternative is that the intrinsic balmer decrement is substantially higher than 3.0 @xcite .",
    "3c 109 is well outside the range of the model .",
    "it is exceptional , either in the intrinsic balmer decrement or the intrinsic index ( or both ) .",
    "alternatively , the model may not apply to 3c 109 , at least not in this simple form .",
    "3c 234 is shown for comparison only ; the model can not be used for the nlrg because the scattered light arises far from the nucleus and can not be presumed to be behind the nuclear screen .",
    "also , the nlrg show an important radiation component , fc2 , that is not accounted for here .",
    "figure 7b shows the galaxy - corrected continuum polarization at 5500   ( rest ) vs @xmath60 for the five blrg and 3c 234 .",
    "there is a trend for the polarization to increase with reddening .",
    "@xcite made a similar plot for 13 blrg ; their sample includes all of our objects except fsc 2217 + 259 .",
    "they explained the correlation between @xmath15 and the balmer decrement as either dichroic absorption or scattering with extinction . the hidden nucleus model for nlrg leads us to consider a more elaborate model to explain the correlation .",
    "it consists of two components : an unpolarized direct ray , and a ray from the nucleus that is scattered and highly polarized .",
    "the components both have extinction , but the direct ray has more .",
    "this is consistent with the presumed blrg geometry in which we are near the edge of the cone .",
    "the direct ray must penetrate more dust than the scattered ray that passes closer to the axis .",
    "the effect of the model is to redden the continuum , increase the balmer decrement , and bluen the polarization by differential dilution .",
    "the model is similar to that used by wills et al .",
    "( 1992 ; see also @xcite ) , except we assume that the extinction of the scattered component arises from dust inside the scattering volume itself .",
    "this has the advantage that the scattering and extinction are coupled , and there is one less free parameter .",
    "the direct ray can be expressed as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the unobstructed flux from the nucleus , and @xmath63 is the optical depth . to properly describe the scattered ray",
    "we should specify a geometry and integrate through the scattering volume .",
    "such calculations have been done by @xcite for a bicone uniformly filled with dust , but we merely make the simple approximation used by fosbury et al .",
    "we assume that the scattered light can be expressed ( approximately ) as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a geometric factor and @xmath66 is a scattering efficiency that depends on the size distribution of the dust particles and on their composition .",
    "each ray passes through a dusty region before and after it is scattered , and the factor @xmath67 accounts for the extinction in the scattering volume .",
    "the optical depth @xmath68 is proportional to an extinction efficiency @xmath69 that is roughly proportional to the scattering efficiency @xmath70 , provided the wavelength is not near the graphite resonance at 2200  .",
    "the net result of these assumptions is that the scattered ray can be expressed as    @xmath71    the function @xmath72 has a maximum at @xmath73 , and most of the contributions to f@xmath74 come from regions near @xmath75 . for simplicity",
    "we now set @xmath76 and eq ( 1 ) becomes    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is independent of wavelength except for geometric factors associated with the change of the @xmath79 surface with wavelength .",
    "@xmath78 is an adjustable parameter ; we expect @xmath80 and in the models shown below we use @xmath81 .",
    "the scattered flux @xmath82 can be highly polarized ; the curves by @xcite show that the intrinsic polarization on @xmath82 , @xmath83 , can be as high as 50% .",
    "the apparent polarization @xmath84 is    @xmath85    equation ( 2 ) states that the scattered flux is proportional to the incident flux ; what we have done is to crudely justify the common assumption that the intrinsic polarization is independent of wavelength . the calculations by manzini &  di serego alighieri",
    ", however , show that @xmath86 generally rises to the red .",
    "the model can be parameterized in various ways . in figure",
    "7b we show lines of constant @xmath87 ( solid ) , and horizontal lines of constant extinction for the direct ray , @xmath88 ( dotted ) , together with the corrected data . in this example",
    "the fixed parameters are @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the model also predicts the balmer decrement and this is shown in figure 7c , which is analogous to figure 7a .",
    "the balmer decrement and the index are limited because @xmath91 , and as @xmath88 increases beyond 3 mag the scattered ray becomes dominant .",
    "3c 109 and fsc 2217 + 259 are outside the range of the model in figure 7c , and they are at the extreme values of @xmath87 in figure 7b .",
    "the blrg of course must have a range in their intrinsic properties , but it is difficult to fit 3c 109 and fsc 2217 + 259 into the scheme described here . enlarging the model by adding excess extinction to or in the blr is one way to accommodate them .",
    "another is by postulating the existence of an additional blue continuum component . in both cases",
    "it must be done in a way that preserves the near equality of @xmath31 for h@xmath0 and the continuum ; i.e. the equivalent widths of the broad lines must be similar for all the rays . in studying the reddening of radio - loud quasars , @xcite found analogous discrepancies .",
    "she suggests that excess reddening to the blr could be the explanation , but that other factors could also be responsible .",
    "optical depth effects that increase the intrinsic balmer decrement could be part of the answer , as could dichroic dust extinction .",
    "see  7.1 .",
    "the point to this exercise is to show that the simple two - component model is able to explain qualitatively the observed spectra and polarimetry of the blrg .",
    "further insight could be obtained with detailed calculations and a specific geometric model , and by examining the full spectrum rather than just the two - point spectral index .",
    "the palomar spectropolarimetry of 3c 109 is discussed by g92 who interpreted the polarization as due to transmission through aligned dust in the host galaxy . in view of the success of the two - component model",
    ", we now think that the origin of the polarization in 3c 109 should be reinvestigated .",
    "3c 109 shows a serkowski - type curve of @xmath92 ( figure 2a ) , but the data are noisy below 5000  .",
    "the appropriate way to discriminate between scattering and dichroic dust extinction is by extending the spectropolarimetry into the uv .    in figures",
    "7a and 7c 3c 109 stands apart from the other blrg .",
    "we can describe this by saying that the balmer decrement is higher than expected from the continuum slope .",
    "this could result from an intrinsically high balmer decrement , or from extra reddening to the blr .",
    "alternatively , we could say that the continuum slope is bluer than expected from the balmer decrement , and this could result from an extra blue continuum component that is not in the model .",
    "evidently there is a number of possibilities for explaining the discrepancy ; and , in addition , there remains the possibility that dichroic extinction plays an role .",
    "@xcite have done extensive modeling of the eelr in 3c 227 .",
    "they show that the velocity field can be modeled ( roughly ) with a bicone of opening angle @xmath93 , tilted @xmath94 to the plane of the sky , and rotating about an axis offset @xmath95 from the cone axis .",
    "the projected bicone axis is at @xmath96 and the projected rotation axis is at @xmath97 .",
    "we look inside a cone but near the edge .",
    "their analysis of the emission lines shows that there is a photon deficit , and they suggest that 3c 227 harbors a quasar .",
    "although the broad lines are prominent the quasar is  hidden \" because most of the ionizing radiation is not directly visible .    the optical continuum radiation is polarized at @xmath98 , which is parallel to the bicone axis .",
    "this is perpendicular to the orientation expected from scattering in the cone , but is consistent with the orientation expected from an optically thin disk coaxial with the cone .",
    "the radio axis is at @xmath99 , which does not seem to be closely related to any of the above angles .",
    "the broad lines are polarized at @xmath100 ( see  9 ) which is @xmath95 ( in projection ) from the cone and continuum radiation axes .",
    "@xmath2 shows notable rotations in the broad balmer lines ; we discuss them in  9 .",

    ", the balmer decrement implies 1.1 magnitudes of extinction , and the color is then explained with @xmath101 , the typical value for radio - loud quasars . to also explain the polarization , especially the fact that @xmath31 rises to the blue , we need to use the two - component model .",
    "figure 7b shows that @xmath102 .",

    "this rise is steeper than shown in figure 3b , but the result is qualitatively correct . to use the model to match the polarization , @xmath58 would have to be reduced to near 1 mag , and the product @xmath106 would have to be doubled .",
    "the point - source polarization image in figure 4 supports the scenario of @xcite described above , in which we are looking into the cone but near the edge .",
    "their photon deficit is  ... about a factor 2 for regions closer than 50 kpc , and a factor 13 for those located at much larger distances . \"",
    "our estimate of 1  2 mag for the v - band extinction to the nucleus is in rough agreement with their estimate of the photon deficit .",
    "they conclude that the intrinsic luminosity of 3c 227 could put it in the quasar class .",
    "our imaging observations of 3c 382 were saturated in three of the four exposures in the @xmath107 beam of the polarimeter , even though we reduced the exposure substantially from the expected value .",
    "they were not saturated in the @xmath108 beam because the throughputs of the two sides differ by about 5% . and ,",
    "as seen in figure 4 , the image shows the hexagonal diffraction pattern due to the secondary support and the mirror shape .",
    "clearly , 3c 382 contained an unusually bright point - like nucleus during our observations .",

    "altogether , we believe that a correction is needed , one rather smaller than the average shown above . however , given the notorious gradients of isp in the galaxy , we do not pursue this farther , since it needs the measurement of stars in proximity to 3c 195 .",
    "the corrected value of @xmath2 is probably close to @xmath93 .",

    "the beam is scattered by electrons and dust in the eelr and we see a partially polarized version of the nuclear spectrum",

    "the red regions are roughly perpendicular to the radius , but they do not extend into the central region .",
    "it is likely that the nuclear region is complex , as it is for the galaxy and for cygnus a , with broken dust clouds and , perhaps , multiple scattering .",
    "it is important also to remember that the polarization images are smoothed by the seeing weighted by the spatial distribution of @xmath33 , and so in weakly polarized regions @xmath2 will be distorted towards its value in nearby strong regions .",

    "in general , the vectors are close to perpendicular to the radius , and so , away from the nucleus , the measured @xmath2 will be close to perpendicular to the slit orientation .",
    "this means that one must take care in comparing a polarization to a radio axis in an nlrg like 3c 195 , because the value of @xmath2 will depend on the details of how it is measured .      for spectropolarimetry we oriented the slit to include the strongly polarized regions shown in figure 5d .",

    "the b - band contours are elongated in the central few arcseconds , with an axis parallel to that of the h@xmath0 image .",

    "this component clearly persists to 6820   or to the end of the red wing in total flux .",
    "its total velocity width is 15,000 km / sec .",
    "the blue side may persist to 6180  , although the noise near 6300   makes this questionable .",
    "its width is at least 7000 km / sec and could be up to 15,000 km / sec .",
    "the value of @xmath248 clearly changes across the blue component , from about @xmath250 to about @xmath251 .",
    "the peak difference between the red and blue components is about @xmath252 .",
    "the two values of @xmath248 for h@xmath0 suggest that we are dealing with two components of the radiation , that are separated in velocity and have different pa s .",
    "the blue component ( b ) is dominant below 6500  , and the red component ( r ) is dominant above 6500  .",
    "inspection of the @xmath179 curve ( figure 1b ) shows that h@xmath0 has a pronounced break near 6500  , and so such a decomposition seems natural .",
    "b and r are separated in velocity by @xmath253 km / sec and are polarized @xmath254 with @xmath2 s that are @xmath255 apart .",
    "the seyfert 1 galaxies studied by goodrich & miller ( 1994 ) , martel ( 1996 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show a variety of rotations in the broad lines , and several of their objects show rotations that are as large and as complicated as those in 3c 445 .",
    "these authors discuss this phenomenon in terms of two or more components that we see via different scattering regions .",
    "the regions must lie fairly close to the blr , for the pa s to differ substantially .",
    "martel decomposes f@xmath7 into gaussians , and the best case is ngc 4151 which yields 7 broad components .",
    "he then identifies some of the components with structures in the galaxy ( a bar , radio and optical axes ) on the basis of pa coincidence .",
    "we do not attempt a similar deconstruction for 3c 227 and 3c 445 here , but restrict ourselves to one component of h@xmath0 for 3c 227 , and two for 3c 445 .    in 3c 227 and 3c 445",
    "none of the pa s is close to being either parallel or perpendicular to the radio axis .",
    "the polarization does not result from simple scattering on a distribution that is symmetric around the radio axis .",
    "what then is the source of the polarization ? in 3c 227 we evidently have different lines of sight into the nuclear continuum source and the blr .",
    "these light sources are spatially separated by a few tenths of a parsec , so we can imagine that different scatterers are responsible for the two different polarizations .",
    "the los is not close to the axis of the dusty torus because the radio source has fr ii morphology with a weak core , and the inclination is probably many tens of degrees .",
    "thus , the required asymmetry is plausible .",
    "a fraction of the h@xmath0 light could be scattered and polarized by dust clouds in or near the blr , and it is possible that absorption in aligned dust particles in front of ( or mixed with ) the h@xmath0 clouds is responsible for some of the polarization .",
    "the dust alignment need not have any simple relation to the polarization of the continuum , which is set much deeper inside the nucleus .",
    "3c 445 is more complex , in that we must account for two components of h@xmath0 , but that also offers more constraints and may limit the range of possible models .",
    "there is not enough information to invert the polarimetry data and solve for the location and motion of the h@xmath0 clouds .",
    "however , we can investigate some simple limiting cases and try to find plausible situations .",
    "we assume that the system contains a blr inside a dusty opaque torus , and that the continuum source is at the center .",
    "the los skims the edge of the torus and we have a limited view of the interior .",
    "we first note that the motions of the h@xmath0 clouds can not be chaotic , since then the red and blue  shifted sources would be spatially mixed , and the red and blue components would have the same pa , contrary to observation .",
    "hence the clouds must be in streaming motion .",
    "this assumes that the velocity shifts are due to motions of the emitting clouds , and not of the scatterers .",
    "further , the lines can not be broadened purely by thermal motions in clouds , for in that case the electrons would produce equal red and blue shifts at every velocity .",
    "blr clouds orbiting inside the torus , near the equatorial plane , provide a scenario which can explain much of the observed asymmetry in the polarization of h@xmath0 .",
    "consider the case of clouds orbiting in circles in the equatorial plane .",
    "the motions are not aimed at us , so the observed high velocities must be due to scattering by clouds that see the full red and blueshifts . in other words ,",
    "the polarized h@xmath0 light that we see has been scattered by material that is close to the orbital plane .",
    "this material can form the inner wall of the torus . if the rotating blr clouds are optically thick they mainly radiate back towards the ionizing source , but still , for circular orbits , half of each emitting hemisphere is visible at the rim and the full range of velocities can be seen in the scattered light .",
    "an appropriate combination of inclination angle and shape of the inner wall of the torus can now provide red and blue components that have different pa s .",
    "see an example in figure 13 . in this example",
    "all clouds move on circles in the same direction . in discussing mrk 231 ,",
    "goodrich & miller ( 1994 ) describe a scenario that is similar to the one we present here .",
    "our scenario only works over a restricted range of inclination angles .",
    "if the inclination is low the nuclear region is entirely visible and we see a quasar . at high inclination",
    "we see an nlrg with polarization perpendicular to the axis .",
    "if the view is near the boundary of the torus the equatorial plane is partially visible ( fig 13 ) and we see a blrg with different pa s for the red and blue wings of h@xmath0 .",
    "this simple model can not be taken literally , for the situation undoubtedly is more complex .",
    "for example , @xcite have described a scenario , based on x - ray spectroscopy , in which the blr is in a warped disk that is not coaxial with the accretion disk .",
    "however , we believe that our concepts still have some validity .",
    "the clouds are in streaming , not chaotic motion .",
    "optically thick clouds in equatorial orbits provide a geometry that meets the observations , although the 3000 km sec@xmath115 offset to the blue is not readily accounted for .",
    "reverberation studies in seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) show that circular orbits are preferred over radial orbits , and this provides an extra measure of support for our scenario .",
    "the model in  6 describes the blrg radiation as a combination of two components , a reddened direct ray and a polarized and reddened scattered ray .",
    "the relative amounts of the two rays fix the spectral index and the amount and spectrum of the polarization .",
    "the nlrg have more attenuation of the direct ray , so that the nuclear continuum and broad h@xmath0 are not directly seen .",
    "they show up in the scattered light , and a weaker component , fc2 , also becomes important .",
    "the evidence for this is that @xmath31 rises in h@xmath0 , indicating a diluting unpolarized component in addition to the polarized continuum fc1 .",
    "observationally , the blrg can be divided into 3 groups that have rather different spectra and polarization .",
    "however , these should not be thought of as separate classes of objects , since they are primarily distinguished by differing extinction and inclination angle .",
    "@xmath256 3c 382 is very blue , has low polarization , and broad h@xmath0 is prominent in total flux but not in polarized flux . in its brighter phases ,",
    "this object is a quasar .",
    "the low polarization of h@xmath0 can be understood if we have a direct , unattenuated view of the blr , so that the scattered ( polarized ) light from the blr is weak in comparison to the direct ray .",
    "another way of looking at this is to imagine that all blrg have a more - or - less standard spectrum of @xmath220 , as exemplified by 3c 227 .",
    "3c 382 additionally has a strong unpolarized component of h@xmath0 that dilutes the polarization in the line .",
    "this combination leaves the position angle unchanged in the line , as required by figure 2b .",
    "@xmath257 3c 227 and 3c 445 are highly polarized in the blue .",
    "the broad lines are equally prominent in total and polarized flux .",
    "pa rotations in h@xmath0 show that there are multiple lines of sight to the blr .",
    "we have a view deep into the illuminated cone , but may not directly see the nuclear continuum source or the blr .",
    "the view probably is close to the edge of the torus .",
    "these two objects are analogous to the type 1 seyferts that have pa rotations , but the rg also have powerful radio jets .",
    "@xmath258 3c 109 and fsc 2217 + 259 are very red , highly polarized , and the polarization of broad h@xmath0 is the same as that of the continuum .",
    "they are closely similar except for the spectral index of the continuum ( figure 7 ) .",
    "fsc 2217 + 259 is a quasar seen through about 3 magnitudes of dust extinction ( according to  7.4.1 ) , with a scattered component in which the continuum and broad lines are polarized the same .",
    "the net polarization @xmath259 is high and rises strongly to the blue ; this is due to the reduction in dilution by the heavily - reddened direct component .",
    "3c 109 has been interpreted as being polarized by selective absorption in aligned dust grains , but in view of its similarity to fsc 2217 + 259 we think it may also have a scattered component .",
    "observations into the uv would be useful for both these objects .    in any event ,",
    "3c 109 and fsc 2217 + 259 are quasars seen through dust .",
    "we are looking deep into the torus , and may have a direct ( but attenuated ) view of the blr and the nuclear continuum source .",
    "fsc 2217 + 259 does not have a compact optical nucleus like the other blrg , and its image of @xmath18 resembles that of 3c 234 .",
    "our work strongly supports the hidden nucleus hypothesis for nlrg and the unification by aspect of many fr ii nlrg , blrg and quasars , in four ways .",
    "@xmath256 reflection nebulae , in the form of fans of polarized light , are seen in some nlrg .",
    "the polarization vectors are circumferential and accurately define a central hidden continuum source .",
    "the fans are roughly co - spatial with the eelr , and the radio axis is usually inside the fans .",
    "@xmath257 broad h@xmath0 is seen in 6 of the 7 polarized nlrg , showing that they contain a hidden blr .",
    "our high - quality spectra show this feature directly , but it is much more prominent in polarized light . the seventh polarized object , 3c 357 , is the weakest and is unreliable because the atmospheric a band falls on the red wing of h@xmath0 .    @xmath258 the intrinsic luminosity of the blrg in our sample , and also of 4 nlrg , 3c 227 ( prieto et al .",
    "1993 ) , 3c 234 ( t95 ) , 3c 321 ( @xcite ) and cyg a ( o97 ) , has been investigated in detail .",
    "it is sufficient to put all of them in or close to the quasar class .",
    "@xmath260 in the blrg the outer reflection nebulae must exist , as they do for the nlrg , but they have not been seen .",
    "however , in blrg the nuclear continuum and broad lines swamp the weaker light from the reflection nebula .",
    "a measure of this difference can be gained from table 3 , where the galaxy fractions @xmath261 show that the starlight ( and presumably the outer scattered light ) is weaker in the blrg than in the nlrg by a factor of 3 to 10 or more .",
    "a further reason why the reflection nebulae might be hard to see in the blrg is foreshortening due to the smaller inclinations .",
    "although the highest - redshift object is 3c 109 , a blrg , the other blrg have redshifts in the range of the nlrg , and angular size is not a major factor in the visibility of the eelr .",
    "another commonly - used aspect indicator is r , the ratio of the radio flux density in the core to the lobe flux density .",
    "log r at 6 cm wavelength is listed in table 5 .",
    "the mean value of log r for the blrg is 1.1 and for the nlrg it is 2.1 .",
    "the difference is highly significant and shows that the blrg radio axes are closer to the los than the nlrg axes , on average .",
    "these results justify the common scenario of an occulting torus that hides the nucleus from direct view but allows collimated nuclear light to be scattered into our los . from other aspects",
    "the nlrg would look like blrg and quasars .",
    "our results suggest that most polarized nlrg contain a hidden blr .",
    "however , we can not generalize about the fraction of unpolarized objects that might show broad lines because we have only one unpolarized nlrg .",
    "we also can not generalize to find the statistical occurrence of broad lines in all nlrg , for the sample is biased towards objects known in advance to be polarized .",
    "broad lines should be seen in the ir if the dusty torus picture is correct .",
    "h96 looked for p@xmath0 in a complete sample of 11 fr ii radio sources , including 1 quasar , 1 blrg , and 9 nlrg .",
    "their sample includes 3c 273 which usually is not called fr ii because it is not a classical radio double .",
    "however , we keep it because it has high luminosity and one visible relativistic jet with an outer lobe",
    ". one nlrg , 3c 319 , is dominated by starlight and has no apparent h@xmath0 ; it was not observed in the ir but we keep it in the sample , which consists of all fr ii 3cr objects in the ranges of flux , redshift , latitude , right ascension and declination chosen by h96 .",
    "we have changed their designation of 3c 234 from blrg to nlrg .",
    "three of their nlrg , 3c 135 , 3c 234 , and 3c 321 , are in our sample .",
    "table 4 summarizes the combined data sets .",
    "y and n simply indicate whether there is or is not evidence for high polarization , broad h@xmath0 and broad p@xmath0 . we have added the polarization value ( n ) for 3c 236 from @xcite , because although a galaxy - subtracted value is not available , the measured value is low , @xmath262 .",
    "table 4 contains 14 nlrg , of which 10 show evidence of broad lines and 4 do not .",
    "there is a strong correlation between polarization and the existence of broad lines : 6 of the 7 nlrg with high @xmath138 show broad lines , and the 2 with no measurable continuum polarization do not show polarized broad lines .",
    "this reinforces the picture seen in our data alone , that polarized objects will show broad lines , either in polarized light or in the ir .",
    "h96 had a complete , if small sample , and the combination of our spectropolarimetric results with their near - ir results is more powerful than either technique alone .",
    "this produces a result that is correspondingly more robust .",
    "while h96 did not see broad p@xmath0 in 3c 135 and 3c 321 , we have shown that there is indeed a blr in these objects .",
    "this brings the number of objects known to have a blr to 8 in the complete h96 sample of 11 fr ii objects , or 6 of the 9 nlrg .",
    "@xcite have made a polarization survey of a complete sample of radio galaxies , of which 6 are fr ii nlrg .",
    "three of the 6 are polarized , but none shows evidence of broad lines .",
    "this seems to contradict our result that polarized nlrg show broad lines , but limits on the strength of the broad lines are not available for their objects .",
    "we believe that a sensitive survey of a larger complete sample is warranted .",
    "the question of whether the unpolarized fr ii nlrg contain a blr is important , and unanswered . in particular , the lack of evidence for broad lines in an object should not be construed as showing that it has no blr .",
    "there may be no signs of broad lines because there is no blr , or because there are no appropriately placed scattering regions .",
    "3c 357 is essentially unpolarized except for a small region ( 3c 357w ) where the hst image shows an off - nuclear emission region .",
    "the polarization there is approximately perpendicular to the line to the center ( figure 6 ) , which suggests that it sees a central continuum source .",
    "it does not appear to scatter any broad lines , but the low s / n does not allow a firm conclusion to be drawn about the existence of a blr in the nuclear region .",
    "3c 105 is unpolarized but still is a powerful fr ii radio galaxy with a strong nlr , and it should have a bright central engine . in this case",
    "the lack of continuum polarization may be due to a lack of scattering material .",
    "the lack of observed broad lines could be due to the absence of a blr , but alternatively it could also be due to a lack of scattering material .",
    "the referee observes that the apparent lack of scattered nuclear light could alternatively be due to obscuration of the scatterers ; this is possible but seems unlikely because the obscuring material would have to cover a large area of the ism .",
    "a polarization image of 3c 105 could be used to search for off - nuclear scattering regions which may have fallen outside our slit .",
    "fosbury points out ( private communication ) that it also is conceivable that the central black hole is not currently being fed , so that the nuclear continuum source and blr are weak , but the long time scales associated with the radio source and the nlr keep them going . as far as we are aware , there are no vlbi observations of 3c 105 , so there is no structural information on scales smaller than a few hundred pc .      in powerful rg the radio axis",
    "is assumed to mark the dynamical axis of the central black hole and accretion disk , and it usually is assumed that any obscuring torus has the same axis . in fr ii objects the radio jets are nearly straight and the projected axis is well - defined . in table 5 we give pa for the radio axis , @xmath2 for the optical polarization , and @xmath263 , the acute angle between them .",
    "the value of @xmath2 for 3c 33 is for the nucleus whereas in table 3 it is for the ne lobe , corresponding to the spectrum in figure 1 ; and for 3c 321 it is for the se flux peak ( figure 5 g ) whereas in table 3 it is for the wide spectrum extraction . in the past much attention has been paid to the relation between @xmath2 and the radio pa , and in particular to the relative orientation of the radio axis with the extra - nuclear uv and emission - line light ( alignment effect ) . in 3c 195 , 3c 321 and",
    "cygnus a the radio jet is well inside the polarization fans and the torus axis can be taken as coincident with the radio axis , although the torus is far from a smooth circular structure and the illuminated cones must be irregular . in 3c 33",
    "the polarized fans are not coaxial and the collimation mechanism appears to give different illumination patterns on the two sides , even though the radio structure is nearly straight across the nucleus .",
    "the inner 6   of the @xmath179 image ( figure 5b ) is nearly symmetric but the large weak region to the n is not repeated in the s. in 3c 33 the @xmath179 axis is far ( @xmath264 ) from the radio axis .",
    "the important feature of the polarization image in nlrg is that it shows the reflection nebula . at the nucleus itself",
    "the polarization becomes weak but in all cases it is within @xmath265 of being perpendicular to the radio axis ( table 5 ) .",
    "we think this comes about because , when there is sufficient symmetry at the apex , the contributions add up to give an orientation perpendicular to the cone axis , which is close to the radio axis . in 3c 33",
    "the alignment effect is one - sided , but the nuclear polarization is still roughly perpendicular to the radio axis . in this case",
    "the polarization rotates strongly and is weak at the nucleus ( figure 5a ) so that observations must have high s / n and high angular resolution to be reliable .",
    "@xcite noted that the blrg are mostly polarized with @xmath2 roughly parallel to the radio axis . from table 5",
    "we see that the blrg differences do not cluster near @xmath266 or anywhere else .",
    "however , there are none near @xmath267 , and the median value of @xmath263 for the blrg is @xmath268 , whereas for the nlrg the mean is @xmath269 .",
    "see also hurt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for nlrg measured in the uv ; they get essentially the same result .",
    "the geometry is simple for the nlrg , because the bright central source is occulted and the scattering takes place far from the nucleus . with the blrg",
    "we have a view deep into the ionization cone , but perhaps not into the nucleus itself .",
    "the polarization is predominantly produced by scattering , and if the ism is irregular a range of @xmath2 is to be expected .",
    "the one object that looks like a quasar , 3c 382 , has @xmath120 , showing that its polarization is close to parallel to the radio axis . in this case",
    "we apparently do have a direct view of the nuclear continuum source , and the various models that have been proposed to explain the polarization , typically involving an equatorial disk , may be appropriate .",
    "the fr ii radio galaxies have a powerful radio jet that is indicative of magnetic field and energetic particles .",
    "hence we might expect that synchrotron radiation could play a role in the optical emission and polarization .",
    "none of our objects shows direct evidence of nuclear synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , we believe that they are obscured or mis - directed quasars . thus if ( radio - loud ) quasars generally do contain a mis - directed blazar , then our objects should also , and there should be a component of synchrotron emission in the continuum radiation . the direct synchrotron beam is narrow and only seen close to the axis .",
    "however , in misdirected objects the beam should illuminate the ism and there should be a narrow bright scattered component .",
    "the only possible sign that we have of this is the polarized off - nuclear emission region in 3c 357 , and the fact that it is close to the radio axis lends weight to this interpretation .",
    "however , the s / n is low in this case , and better observations are needed before this possibility can be discussed .    in their discussion of cygnus",
    "a , o97 noted that the larger and more highly polarized fan is on the west side , and that this is the front side of the galaxy , as determined by radio observations .",
    "they commented that this is consistent with increased forward scattering on dust particles .",
    "we do not have the conclusive information provided by vlbi for the other nlrg with fans , but still can compare the size and strength of the fans with other indicators .",
    "we have 3 potential indicators of sidedness : radio structure , polarization fans , and velocity .",
    "table 6 shows the results .",
    "column 2 gives the side with the larger and stronger polarization fan .",
    "as can be seen in figure 5 , these are the regions which have extensions in @xmath220 , although the peak values of @xmath220 are on the opposite side .",
    "we have individual spectra for the two sides and the blue - shifted side is noted ; this side is in front if the material is out - flowing .",
    "we also attempted to establish the side in front with a radio image .",
    "in cygnus a this is unambiguously determined by vlbi . in the others we chose the side that has the more complete and stronger jet , but in 3c 33 we were unable to choose .",
    "it appears in table 6 that the correlations are no more than would be given by chance , and that the cygnus a result can not be generalized .",
    "we have sensitive keck spectral and imaging polarimetry on 13 fr ii radio galaxies  five blrg and eight nlrg .",
    "one nlrg is unpolarized and the others have continuum polarizations ranging from 0.7% to 9.6% at 5500   ( rest frame ) .",
    "when @xmath15 is corrected for galactic starlight the polarizations rise to 15% , and in 3c 33 a further correction for fc2 yields a value @xmath270 for the intrinsic polarization of the scattered nuclear light .",
    "high values like this are expected from scattering in an optically thin cone .",
    "broad h@xmath0 is visible in six of the seven polarized nlrg . in five of them",
    "the broad lines can be directly seen in the spectrum of total flux , but they are more prominent in polarized flux . in all the polarized nlrg except 3c 357 , and perhaps 3c 135 , the polarization of broad h@xmath0 after correction for galactic starlight is higher than in the neighboring continuum .",
    "this is evidence for an additional polarization - diluting continuum component , called fc2 .",
    "its nature is unknown but it could be due to hot stars or brehmsstrahlung .",
    "@xmath2 ( measured at the nucleus ) is within 24of perpendicular to the radio axis for all the nlrg ; the mean value of @xmath271",
    ". the blrg are not close to parallel . the median value of @xmath272 , and only one ( 3c 382 ) has @xmath273 .",
    "the b band nlrg polarization images show a symmetric polarization pattern characteristic of a bipolar reflection nebula .",
    "these objects contain a blr and a continuum source which is hidden from us by dust but revealed by the polarization spectra and images . from directions within the scattering cone",
    "they would look like blrg or quasars .",
    "hence , the obscuring torus paradigm unifying seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies also applies to fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "a large fraction of polarized nlrg contain a blr , but we do not know if the correlation between @xmath15 and the blr is intrinsic or merely due to the existence of appropriately located scattering material that produces the polarization and also allows the blr to be recognized .",
    "conversely , we have one unpolarized nlrg that does not show broad lines .",
    "we do not know if the blr is missing or if there is just a lack of scattering material .",
    "we are unable to generalize these results to find , for example , the fraction of nlrg that are polarized , as our sample is strongly biased towards objects known in advance to be polarized .",
    "there is a hint in the low s / n data for 3c 357 that there is no blr , because the west emission region ( w ) appears to partly consist of scattered nuclear continuum light , but there is no broad h@xmath0 .",
    "however , this suggestion is not correct if w is scattering a beamed synchrotron component .",
    "there probably is a variation in the luminosity of the blr in these rg , and that , together with the aspect and extinction , can explain the gradation in broad h@xmath0 seen in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "we follow @xcite in defining an nlrg as one in which the blr ( and continuum source ) is mainly seen by scattering , and a blrg as one dominated by direct nuclear light . by this definition ,",
    "3c 234 is an nlrg although broad lines are easily visible in total flux .",
    "we suggest that trying to draw careful distinctions here is unimportant , and that it is the geometric and physical properties in the nucleus that are of interest .",
    "we propose a model for the blrg in which the spectra are composed of differing fractions of direct and scattered light , with reddening .",
    "the model explains the general blue shape of the polarization spectra , but does not fit 3c 109 and fsc 2217 + 259 very well .",
    "these are the two red blrg with large extinction on the direct ray .",
    "3c 227 and 3c 445 have marked rotations in @xmath2 in the broad lines .",
    "we interpret this to mean that there are multiple lines of sight to the blr .",
    "we have a partial view deep into the nucleus but probably near the edge of the torus .",
    "we suggest that the broad - line clouds are in streaming , not chaotic motion , and we describe a simple scenario of clouds in equatorial orbits that can explain much of the observed rotation phenomena in 3c 445 .",
    "3c 382 was very bright and was a quasar at our observing epochs .",
    "at other epochs it has been several magnitudes weaker and had an easily - visible host galaxy . in this case",
    "the names quasar and blrg have little physical distinction other than to define whether or not the nuclear source is brighter than the stars .",

    "<S> we have made high - quality measurements of the polarization spectra of 13 fr ii radio galaxies and taken polarization images for 11 of these with the keck telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> seven of the eight narrow - line radio galaxies ( nlrg ) are polarized , and six of the seven show prominent broad balmer lines in polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> the broad lines are also weakly visible in total flux . </S>",
    "<S> some of the nlrg show bipolar regions with roughly circumferential polarization vectors , revealing a large reflection nebula illuminated by a central source . </S>",
    "<S> our observations powerfully support the hidden quasar hypothesis for some nlrg . according to this hypothesis , </S>",
    "<S> the continuum and broad lines are blocked by a dusty molecular torus , but can be seen by reflected , hence polarized , light . </S>",
    "<S> classification as nlrg , broad - line radio galaxy ( blrg ) , or quasar therefore depends on orientation . however , not all objects fit into this unification scheme . </S>",
    "<S> our sample is biased towards objects known in advance to be polarized , but the combination of our results with those of hill , goodrich , & depoy ( 1996 ) show that at least 6 out of a complete , volume and flux - limited sample of 9 fr ii nlrg have broad lines , seen either in polarization or p@xmath0 .    the blrg in our sample range from 3c 382 , which has a quasar - like spectrum , to the highly - reddened iras source fsc 2217 + 259 . </S>",
    "<S> this reddening sequence suggests a continuous transition from unobscured quasar to reddened blrg to nlrg . apparently the obscuring torus does not have a distinct edge </S>",
    "<S> the blrg have polarization images which are consistent with a point source broadened by seeing and diluted by starlight . </S>",
    "<S> we do not detect extended nebular or scattered emission , perhaps because it is swamped by the nuclear source . </S>",
    "<S> our starlight - corrected blrg spectra can be explained with a two - component model : a quasar viewed through dust , and quasar light scattered by dust . </S>",
    "<S> the direct flux is more reddened than the scattered flux , causing the polarization to rise steeply to the blue . </S>",
    "<S> strong rotations of the electric vector position angle across h@xmath0 in 3c 227 and 3c 445 may be explained by systematic orbital motions in an equatorial broad - line region . </S>"
