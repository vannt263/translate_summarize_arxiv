    "the current accelerated expansion of the universe is one of the biggest challenges in modern cosmologies . a wide range of astronomical data , including supernova type ia ( sneia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , large scale structures ( lss ) @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao )",
    "@xcite confirm the current accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this is a surprising result , since in a universe dominated by matter , and therefore where gravity is attractive , we should expect the acceleration to slow down . within the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , the accelerated expansion can be accommodated by the introduction of an unknown form of energy with sufficiently negative pressure , the so called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "observational results of the planck satellite @xcite indicate that de is @xmath4 of the total energy budget of the universe , while pressureless matter ( baryons and cold dark matter ) amount to @xmath5 .",
    "hence , at the present time the dominant component is the de with a negative equation of state ( eos ) @xmath6 .",
    "a very simple and important example of fluid with negative eos is einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath2 , with @xmath7 independent of time @xcite .",
    "although the cosmological constant is consistent with observational data , it suffers from the fine - tuning and the cosmic coincidence problems @xcite .",
    "alternatively , extensions and/or modifications of einstein gravity theory , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 models , can explain the present cosmic acceleration @xcite . in a general relativistic framework ,",
    "de models with equation of state @xmath10 have been proposed , usually in the context of scalar fields such as quintessence models , in order to solve or alleviate the cosmological constant problems @xcite . moreover ,",
    "phenomenological models with time evolving eos parameter @xmath11 have been suggested @xcite .    de not only accelerates the expansion rate of the universe but also changes the growth rate of matter perturbations of cosmic structures .",
    "in fact , the growth of matter perturbation @xmath12 of overdense regions is slowed down by the hubble drag in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "hence , increasing the hubble parameter in de cosmologies causes an increasingly lower growth of structures .",
    "if de is not the cosmological constant , we can assume fluctuations in both time and space @xcite , in a similar fashion to what happens for matter .",
    "these fluctuations will therefore have an impact on the growth of matter perturbation @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that de is now not only important at the background level , but its fluctuations can enhance or dampen also fluctuations in the dark matter fluid .",
    "the key parameter to describe perturbations for the de fluid is the effective sound speed @xmath13 . in the context of canonical scalar fields , @xmath14 ( in units of the light speed , @xmath15 ) , so that de perturbations take place on scales equal to or larger than the horizon and are totally negligible on smaller scales @xcite .",
    "however , for non - canonical scalar fields , like k - essence models , the effective sound speed is different from 1 , so that we can consider @xmath16 . in this case ,",
    "de perturbations can grow and be significant also on sub - horizon scales @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath17 , perturbations can grow at the same rate as matter perturbations @xcite .",
    "hence , one can consider the impact of de perturbations on the formation of cosmic structure on sub - horizon scales . in this work we focus on the effect of de perturbations on the growth rate of matter in linear regime .",
    "the growth of matter perturbation is described by the growth rate function @xmath18 , usually parametrized with the phenomenological functional form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fractional energy density of matter in the universe and @xmath21 is the so - called growth index @xcite .",
    "the growth index for the concordance @xmath2cdm model is approximately scale independent and constant with value @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "modified gravity models have @xmath23 at the present time @xmath24 @xcite . in the context of the dvali - gadabadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld gravity model @xcite ,",
    "the growth index is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this model has essentially been ruled out by observations , e.g. by the wigglez dark energy survey @xcite .    in the framework of general relativity with dark energy characterised by a constant equation - of - state parameter , the growth index @xmath21 is theoretically approximated by @xmath26 @xcite which explicitly reduces to the well known value @xmath27 in the traditional @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath7 .",
    "observationally , the growth rate @xmath28 has been used to constrain de models and the growth index @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "on the basis of observations , a wide range of values for @xmath29 has been obtained @xcite .",
    "the weakness in using the observed values @xmath30 of the growth rate is due to the fact that it is model dependent , so that they can only be used to test the consistency of the @xmath2cdm model . here , we rather prefer to use the quantity @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the time - dependant rms amplitude of the overdensity @xmath33 at the comoving scale of @xmath34  mpc .",
    "the advantage is that this quantity is almost model independent and therefore suits better in constraining de models @xcite . using the observational growth data @xmath31",
    ", we will constraint cde models with equation of state @xmath35 . as mentioned before , in cde models",
    "the sound horizon of de perturbations is well within the hubble scale @xmath36 and de clusters on scales outside its sound horizon and smaller than the hubble length @xcite . in the same way , cold dark matter clumps on scales greater than its own jeans scale . instead for canonical de models , the sound horizon is equal to or larger than the hubble length and de perturbations can not grow on sub - horizon scales . in this work",
    "we explore the signature of cde models on the growth index of cosmic structures .",
    "we put constraints on the growth index @xmath21 for a given cde model and compare the results with the standard @xmath2cdm scenario .",
    "we will show that in cde models , @xmath21 may have substantial variations with cosmic redshift , so that the usual constant growth index parametrization is in general not suitable in these cases . due to the inaccuracy of a constant @xmath21 parametrization in cde",
    ", we use a general redshift dependent exponential parametrization and obtain the best fit values of the parameters .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : gamma ] we present the coupled differential equations governing the perturbations of matter and de and argue about the growth index in such a system .",
    "the effect of de perturbations on the growth index is discussed . in sect .",
    "[ sect : constraints ] we constrain the eos parameter of de for two different models , with constant and time - varying equation of state , by means of the @xmath1 analysis .",
    "we then evaluate @xmath31 and compare our theoretical prediction with observational data .",
    "our results show that perturbations in the de component give a better fit to observational data with respect to the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "we finally conclude in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe , in the linear perturbation theory for scales much smaller than the hubble radius , the following differential equation describes the evolution of the perturbations of pressureless matter overdensities @xmath37 @xcite :    @xmath38    it is well known that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : deltam ] ) is still valid for de cosmologies where its effects are only at the background level . in this case",
    "the de fluid only modifies the hubble function h. this is not the case any more when de perturbations kick in .    in the case of cde models ,",
    "we use the following set of linear coupled differential equations obtained in the framework of the spherical collapse model with the usual top - hat approximation by @xcite :    @xmath39\\ ; , \\label{eqn : deltadm1}\\\\ & & \\ddot{\\delta}_{\\rm de}+\\left(2h-\\frac{\\dot{w}_{\\rm de}}{1+w_{\\rm de}}\\right)\\dot{\\delta}_{\\rm de}=\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad\\frac{3}{2}h^2(1+w_{\\rm de})\\left[\\omega_{\\rm m}\\delta_{\\rm m}+ \\omega_{\\rm de}\\delta_{\\rm de}(1 + 3w_{\\rm de})\\right]\\;,\\label{eqn : deltadm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where overdot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath35 indicate the perturbations and the eos parameter of de , respectively . under the top - hat approximation , @xmath33 and @xmath41 are uniform inside the perturbed region and therefore are a function of cosmic time only .",
    "it should be emphasized that perturbation theory based on the top - hat approximation is fully consistent with gr and pseudo - newtonian cosmology in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that the growing modes of perturbations in gr and in the pseudo - newtonian formalism are the same and differences appear only in the decaying mode . using the relation @xmath42 , eqs .",

    "analogously to the @xmath2cdm model , the growth index in non - clustering dark energy ( non - cde ) models is largely redshift - independent , both for phantom ( blue dotted line ) and quintessence ( black short - dashed line ) regimes .",
    "we also see that differences from the @xmath2cdm model are negligible in non - cde models . however , in cde models , where @xmath61 and non - negligible , the growth index changes with redshift and can become as high as @xmath62 for the quintessence case ( violet solid curve ) and as low as @xmath63 in the phantom case ( dot - dashed red curve ) .",
    "it is also possible to appreciate the large deviation of @xmath0 in cde models from the concordance @xmath2cdm value @xmath64 as well .",
