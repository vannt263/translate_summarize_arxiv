    "urban acoustic researches are divided in three thematics : the sources characterization and identification , the acoustic propagation and the noise perception in an urban context .",
    "this work enters in the second thematic : its purpose is to describe the propagation of sound emitted by known sources in a street by taking into account its physical morphology ( open roof , height and width of the street ) .    to study acoustic propagation in an urban context , several approaches are available : energetical methods @xcite based on the estimation of a quadratic quantity ( energy density or acoustic intensity ) , numerical methods @xcite to estimate acoustic pressure or velocity and modal approach @xcite to calculate the pressure or velocity fields .",
    "+ energetical methods are largely used in urban acoustics but concern a limited frequency range : the image sources method @xcite , the ray tracing approach @xcite , the radiosity method @xcite and finally statistical methods of particle transport @xcite are generally used for middle and high frequencies .",
    "all these approaches propose to modelize the effect of the street open roof by a complete absorption of the wave .",
    "+ the numerical methods , as finite element method ( fem ) or boundary element method ( bem ) , are restricted for urban acoustics to low frequencies for @xmath1d case or very low frequencies for @xmath0d case @xcite because of the large time cost dur to the discretization .",
    "+ the modal approach , where the geometrical characteristics of the street are explicitely taken into account in the model , is generally not used due to the complexity of the medium and to the difficulty to determine the modes of an open space like a street canyon .",
    "for example , bullen _ and al _ @xcite have studied the acoustic propagation in a guide with infinite height or more recently , the modal approach was used to calculate the @xmath1d field in a street section , the acoustic radiation conditions being described by an equivalent sources distribution at the interface between the street and the free space @xcite .",
    "this review highlights more particularly that the open aperture of the street on the half free space , essential characteristic of the urban environment , is taken into account only in @xmath1d ( in a section ) and rarely in @xmath0d urban acoustic problem @xcite . only the energetical approaches",
    "modelize this characteristic by a complete absorption of the wave but these methods are restricted to middle and high frequencies and this asumption of complete absorption should be justified at these frequencies and moreover at low frequencuencies .",

    "<S> this paper presents an experimental , numerical and analytical study of the effect of open roof on acoustic propagation along a @xmath0d urban canyon . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental study is led by means of a street scale model . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are performed with a @xmath1d finite difference in time domain approach adapted to take into account the acoustic radiation losses due to the street open roof . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical model , based on the modal decomposition of the pressure field in a horizontal plane mixed with a @xmath1d image sources model to describe the attenuation along the street , is also proposed . </S>",
    "<S> results are given for several frequencies in the low frequency domain ( @xmath2 hz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the three approaches shows a good agreement until @xmath3 hz at full scale , the analytical model and the @xmath1d numerical simulation adapted to @xmath0d permit to modelize the acoustic propagation along a street . </S>",
    "<S> for higher frequency , experimental results show that the leakeage , due to the street open roof , is not anymore uniformly distributed on all modes of the street . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of leaky modes must be introduced to modelize the acoustic propagation in a street canyon .    </S>",
