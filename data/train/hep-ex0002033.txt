    "a view of the atlas calorimeters @xcite is presented in figure [ f-00 ] .",
    "the calorimetry consists of an electromagnetic ( em ) calorimeter covering the pseudorapidity region @xmath7 , a hadronic barrel calorimeter covering @xmath8 , hadronic end - cap calorimeters covering @xmath9 , and forward calorimeters covering @xmath10 .",
    "the em calorimeter is a lead / liquid - argon ( lar ) detector with accordion geometry @xcite . over the pseudorapidity range @xmath11 , it is preceded by a presampler detector , installed immediately behind the cryostat cold wall , and used to correct for the energy lost in the material upstream of the calorimeter .",
    "the hadronic calorimetry of atlas , presented in figure [ f-00 ] , consists of three main devices . in the barrel region ( @xmath12 )",
    "there is the scintillating tile calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the hadronic end - cap lar calorimeter ( hec ) extends up to @xmath13 . the range @xmath10 is covered by the high density forward calorimeter ( fcal ) . up",
    "to @xmath14 the basic granularity of the hadron calorimeters is @xmath15 .",
    "this region is used for precise measurements of the energy and angles of jets . in the region",
    "@xmath16 , the basic granularity is approximately @xmath17 .",
    "a more detailed description of all atlas calorimeters is given in the calorimeter tdrs ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the performance of the barrel and extended barrel sections of the atlas hadronic calorimeter for the measurement of charged pion energy is studied .",
    "the intrinsic energy resolution , the effects of dead material , electronic noise and limited cone size are discussed .",
    "in the barrel region , the response of the calorimeter was studied at two pseudorapidity values : @xmath2 ( central barrel ) and @xmath18 ( extended barrel ) .",
    "first , the energy sampled in the different calorimeter compartments is converted to the total deposited energy using the electromagnetic energy scale ( em scale ) .",
    "the intrinsic performance of the calorimeter is studied : the energy considered is not restricted to a cone and electronic noise is not added .",
    "these effects are discussed later in section [ noise ] . the algorithm to reconstruct",
    "the pion energy is similar to the  benchmark method  used to analyse the combined lar - tile test beam data @xcite @xmath19    the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 take into account the different response of the em and hadronic calorimeters to the pion energy .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath22 provides an additional first order correction for non - compensation ( the coefficient is negative , it suppresses the signal for events with a large fraction of electromagnetic energy ) .",
    "the term @xmath23 estimates the energy loss in the cryostat wall separating the lar and tile calorimeters . in the central barrel ,",
    "the energy is taken from the geometric mean of the energies in the last compartment of the lar em barrel ( @xmath24 ) and the first compartment of the tile barrel calorimeter ( @xmath25 ; whereas in the extended barrel the energy is taken from the geometric mean of the energies in the outer wheel of the em end - cap and the first compartment of the tile extended barrel calorimeter .",
    "the term @xmath26 corrects for the energy loss in the dead material in the vertical gap between the tile central and extended barrels .",
    "it is sampled by the two intermediate tile calorimeter ( itc ) modules ( see figure [ f-01 ] ) .",
    "the last term @xmath27 corrects for the energy loss in the barrel and end - cap vertical cryostat walls ( see figure [ f-01 ] ) .",
    "the response and the energy resolution for pions in the energy range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 at @xmath2 and 1.3 are shown in figures [ f-02 ] and [ f-03 ] .",
    "the open crosses show the results when the coefficients of equation ( [ eq-03 ] ) are independent of energy . with the simple  benchmark method  ,",
    "the effect of non - compensation is not fully corrected for and there is a residual non - linearity of the pion response of the order of @xmath30 between 20 gev and 1 tev .",
    "the test beam data show a 10% residual non - linearity between 20 and 300 gev when using the same reconstruction method @xcite , reflecting the fact that g - calor @xcite predicts a lower degree of non - compensation and may not describe correctly the energy dependence of the fraction of electromagnetic energy produced in the pion interaction .",
    "the energy dependence of the resolution is fitted with the two - term formula @xmath31 where the sampling term @xmath32 is given in @xmath33 and the constant term @xmath34 in @xmath35 .",
    "although the resolutions obtained for low - energy pions are similar in both cases , at high energy there is some longitudinal leakage in the central barrel , yielding a resolution at 1 tev of 3% instead of the 2% obtained in the extended barrel .",
    "when energy dependent parameters are applied ( solid dots ) , the linearity of the response is restored without the addition of a linear term @xmath36 with a lagrange multiplier . ] and the resolution improved .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tb-01 ] :     @xmath37 & @xmath32 ( @xmath38)&@xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) + 0.3 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + 1.3 & @xmath41 & @xmath42 +",
    "a pseudorapidity scan with pions of constant transverse energy @xmath5 and 50 gev was carried out to check that the linearity of the response can be maintained across the pseudorapidity range covered by the barrel and the extended barrel , and that no significant tail appears in the line shape .",
    "the algorithm , characterised by equation ( [ eq-03 ] ) , with energy dependent parameters was applied .",
    "the parameters were adjusted independently for the six sets of pion data , each one covering an interval of 0.4 in pseudorapidity .",
    "the energy resolutions obtained for the two scans are shown in figure [ f-04 ] .",
    "the solid lines show the energy resolution corresponding to equation @xmath43 for @xmath5 gev and @xmath44 for @xmath45 gev .",
    "this performance allows to fulfil the goal for the jet energy resolution of the atlas hadronic calorimetry in the region @xmath46 of @xmath47 .    in the region of the cracks between the calorimeters , from about @xmath48 to @xmath49 , where the amount of dead material is the largest ,",
    "the resolution is somewhat worse .",
    "figure [ f-04b ] shows the linearity of the response across @xmath37 .",
    "the fitted mean is plotted for each interval of 0.05 in @xmath37 .",
    "the rms of the mean is 1.1% for @xmath45 gev and 2.0% for @xmath5 gev .",
    "in addition , the tails of the distributions of the reconstructed energy were investigated .",
    "figure [ f-05 ] shows the events with a pion response more than three standard deviations away from the mean .",
    "no significant tails are present : the fraction of events in the tails does not exceed 1  2% .",
    "a few events out of a total of 5000 events per energy scan , mostly from the sample of pions of @xmath5 gev , deposit relatively little energy .",
    "these correspond to pions decaying to muons before reaching the calorimeter .",
    "the results presented so far were obtained without any restriction on the pion reconstruction volume .",
    "these results characterise the intrinsic performance of the calorimeters .",
    "the presence of electronic noise does not allow integration over a too wide region , therefore the measurement of the pion energy must be restricted to a cone @xmath50    a compromise has to be found between the pion energy lost outside of this cone and the noise included inside .",
    "the optimum varies as a function of pseudorapidity , since the showers have a width which is characterised by the polar angle whereas the calorimeter cells subtend intervals of constant pseudorapidity .",
    "hence , at higher values of pseudorapidity , the showers extend laterally over more cells .    for a cone of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) ,",
    "the noise is above 3 gev ( 1.5 gev ) .",
    "digital filtering @xcite allows noise suppression ( approximately by a factor 1.6 ) .",
    "but even this level of noise is large and is comparable to the intrinsic resolution of the calorimeters for pions with energy of a few tens of gev .",
    "a smaller cone of @xmath52 is preferable from this point of view ; after digital filtering , noise can be kept around 1 gev in the barrel region and below 3 gev in the pseudorapidity region covered by the extended barrel .",
    "the response and the energy resolution in the barrel region are presented in figures [ f-06 ] and [ f-07 ] as a function of the cone size used for the pion energy reconstruction .",
    "energy losses outside a cone noticeably increase with decreasing cone size , especially for 50 gev pions .",
    "the energy resolution also becomes worse , but it is still acceptable for the cone of @xmath52 .",
    "selecting cells with energy deposition above a certain threshold decreases the noise contribution .",
    "a study to optimise the cone size and the noise cut was performed in the barrel region .",
    "a @xmath53-noise applied to the calorimeter cells within a cone of @xmath52 leads to the best energy resolution . in figure",
    "[ f-08 ] , the energy dependency of the resolution is plotted for two pseudorapidities : @xmath2 and @xmath18",
    ". the energy dependence of the resolution can be parametrised by the equation [ eq-04 ] with an additional noise term : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is given in @xmath56 .",

    "the response of the barrel and extended barrel region of the atlas calorimeter system to single charge pions was investigated using full simulation .",
    "pion energy scans from @xmath66 gev to @xmath1 gev and pseudo rapidity scans with pions of constant transverse energy ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 gev ) have been analysed . for the pion energy reconstruction , the  benchmark approach  was used : it provides a first order correction for non - compensation effects and accounts for the effect of the dead material by using the itc s and scintillators to sample the energy loss or interpolating between the energy deposited in adjacent calorimeter layers .",
    "energy and rapidity dependent and independent calibrations have been considered .",
