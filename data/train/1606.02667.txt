    "understanding quantum correlations and entanglement in many - body systems is one of the main purposes of fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "although a general strategy for this task currently lacks , in the last decades many advances have been made .",
    "in particular , one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems play a very special role in this scenario , for two reasons : the first is of physical nature , and resides in the enhancement of the importance of quantum fluctuations , due to dimensionality @xcite ; the second is the existence of extremely powerful analytical and numerical techniques , such as exact solutions @xcite , bosonization @xcite , bethe ansatz @xcite , and matrix - product - states algorithms @xcite , allowing for the extraction of accurate information about low - lying excitations in a non - perturbative way . within the bosonization framework ,",
    "the strategy is to identify the relevant degrees of freedom of the considered 1d model and , starting from them , to build up an effective field theory capturing its low - energy physics @xcite .",
    "if the ground state ( gs ) of the original model is gapless , the obtained field theory is usually conformally invariant , and is therefore called conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite ( we remark that bosonization is not the only approach leading to effective cft s ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . due to their solvability in @xmath0d ,",
    "cft s are particularly useful , allowing for the exact computation of all correlation functions , and therefore providing access to many interesting quantities in a controllable way @xcite .    in the present work we deal with a particular class of entanglement measures , the rnyi entanglement entropies ( ree s )",
    "@xcite , defined in the following way .",
    "let us consider a pure state of an extended quantum system , associated with a density matrix @xmath1 , and a spatial bipartition of the system itself , say @xmath2 .",
    "if we are interested in computing quantities that are spatially restricted to @xmath3 , we can employ , instead of the full density matrix , the reduced density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5-th ree , defined as @xmath6 describes the reduced density matrix . in the limit @xmath7 it reproduces the von neumann entanglement entropy ( vnee ) @xmath8 $ ] , the most common entanglement measure @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "the @xmath9 ree s have also become quite popular , for several reasons .",
    "analytical methods proved to be more suitable to calculate ree s than vnee , especially in field theory : e.g. , in cft , ree s have a clear interpretation as partition functions , while the vnee does not @xcite . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", the knowledge of the ree s @xmath10 is equivalent to the knowledge of @xmath11 itself , since they are proportional to the momenta of @xmath11 . at the same time , from a physical point of view , many of the important properties of the vnee , e.g. , the area law for gapped states @xcite and the proportionality to the central charge for critical systems @xcite , carry over to ree s as well .",
    "in fact , ree s are easily computable by matrix - product - states algorithms @xcite , and they allow for a precise estimation of the central charge from numerical data regarding the gs of the system ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "finally , and very importantly , measurements of the @xmath12 ree in an ultracold - atoms setup have been recently performed @xcite , paving the way to the experimental study of entanglement measures in many - body systems .    the computations of refs .",
    "@xcite , that deal with the gs of cft s , have been extended , in more recent times , to excited states @xcite . in cft , excitations are in one - to - one correspondence with fields , and can be organized in conformal towers @xcite .",
    "the lowest - energy state of each tower is in correspondence with a so - called _ primary _ field , while the remaining ones , called _ descendant _ , are in correspondence with _ secondary _ fields , obtained from the primaries by the application of conformal generators . while the properties of ree s for primary states are now quite well understood @xcite , much less is known about the descendants . in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite , a unifying picture for the computation of ree s of primary and descendant states was developed and both analytical and numerical computations for the scaling limit of simple spin chains with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) were performed .",
    "a related but physically different problem was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the effect on the time evolution of inserting secondary operators at finite time was studied .    in this paper",
    "we continue the work in ref . @xcite and extend its framework to the case of open boundary conditions ( obc ) that preserve conformal invariance .",
    "this is an important step , for several reasons .",
    "first , impurity problems @xcite and certain problems in string theory @xcite map to boundary cft ; not secondarily , the experimentally achievable setups often involve obc .",
    "the importance of descendant states stems from novel applications , including non - trivial checks of the universality class of critical lattice models , and understanding the behavior of degenerate multiplets .",
    "we will provide a general strategy for the computation of ree s , derive cft predictions for descendant states , and compare them to the numerical data obtained from lattice realizations of the considered cft s .",
    "we will also discuss some interesting complementary aspects arising naturally when considering descendant states : e.g. , we will need to consider the ree s of linear combinations on the cft side , in order to study degenerate states in the xx chain .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ cft_sec ]",
    "we will review the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite for systems with pbc , derive the procedure to compute the ree s for descendant states in cft s with ( and without ) boundaries , and provide some general results for states related to the tower of the identity . in section [ ising_sec ] we will compute explicitly the ree s for the @xmath13 minimal cft , and compare the scalings to the numerical data obtained for the spin-1/2 ising model in a transverse field ; in section [ potts ] we will perform the same study for the @xmath14 minimal cft and the three - state potts model , while in section [ xx ] for the compactified free boson and the spin-1/2 xx chain . in section [ conc ] we will draw our conclusions and some directions for future work . in the appendixes we will provide useful technical details of our discussion .",
    "in the scaling limit , critical 1d lattice models can be described by cft s @xcite .",
