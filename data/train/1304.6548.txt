    "since anderson s pioneering work @xcite , where the concept of localization of an electron moving in a random potential was introduced , propagation of electromagnetic waves through disordered media have been attracting a lot of interest ( see , for example , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the reasons for such interest is the possibility of observing weak localization effects in disordered systems .",
    "most of the papers were devoted to the backscattering peak where weak localization effects are manifest ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and for a recent experiment @xcite ) .",
    "the influence of polarization effects on the backscattering peak was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . along with the transport properties of disordered media , magneto - optical effects in such systems capture broader attention .",
    "particularly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the light backscattering peak in parity - non conserving disordered media was investigated .",
    "in such a medium rotation of the polarization plane is possible .",
    "a faraday rotation is a magneto - optical phenomenon that rotates the polarization of light .",
    "it occurs as an internal property of medium as well as under the external magnetic field . in both cases",
    "the dielectric permittivity tensor of the system becomes anisotropic .",
    "for example , in _ gaas _ crystal large faraday rotation @xcite origins because of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "faraday rotation is observed in astronomy .",
    "there it is used for measurement of magnetic fields @xcite .    in the past decade many experimental papers @xcite-@xcite have been devoted to the faraday rotation in disordered media . in refs .",
    "@xcite attention was drawn to the fact , that a large enhancement of the faraday rotation can be obtained in nanomaterials incorporating several nanoparticles and their composites .",
    "a garnet composite film ( mostly a bi - substituted yttrium iron garnet ( bi : yig ) ) incorporating gold nanoparticles or a nanoparticles solution with gold coated @xmath6 @xcite show a change in the sign of the faraday rotation at the wavelengths corresponding to the surface plasmon absorption peak of the gold nanoparticles . around the local surface plasmon resonance wavelengths a resonant transmittance attenuation and a large resonant enhancement of the faraday rotation with a narrow bandwidth",
    "was obtained in ref @xcite . recently a large faraday rotation was observed @xcite in a ultrathin graphene film . the analogy with the hall effect",
    "is revealed .    the standard effective medium approximations ( maxwell - garnet and bruggeman theories ) @xcite describe the macroscopic properties of a medium using the average dielectric constant determined by the relative fractions of its components .",
    "these theories show only qualitative agreement with the experimental data of refs.@xcite .",
    "many of the questions that have been raised during the experiments are still waiting for answers .",
    "for example , no corresponding analytical calculation has been available so far for a discrepancy in the bandwidth between the transmission attenuation and the resonant faraday rotation ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . of particular importance is the influence of the disorder , induced by the presence of the impurities , on the faraday angle and on several related quantities .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a theoretical approach for investigating the faraday rotation for transmitted and backscattered waves in three - dimensional disordered media .",
    "we show that the maximum faraday rotation angle of the transmitted wave is achieved at the frequencies where the photon elastic mean free path is minimal . in the backscattered wave the maximally crossed diagrams contribution to",
    "the faraday rotation angle is very important .",
    "it leads to an ellipticity of the backscattered wave in the localized regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we formulate the problem .",
    "the coherent potential approximation is discussed in sec .",
    "iii and appropriate contribution to the faraday angle is calculated . in sec .",
    "iv we present result for the diffusional contribution to the faraday rotational angle .",
    "diffusional and maximally crossed diagrams contributions are taken into account for kerr effect in sec .",
    "v. obtained analytical results are compared with experimental data in sec .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the paper contains two appendices , which present some technical details useful for the understanding of diffusional and maximally crossed diagrams contributions to the kerr effect .",
    "let us consider the incidence of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave on the optically active medium , see fig.1 .    .",
    "after transmission through a slab the polarization vector rotates.,width=340 ]    we assume that the incident field is polarized on @xmath7 , the plane of incidence is @xmath8 , wave vector is directed on @xmath9 . because of the scattering transmitted field contains all the directions of wave vector . in order to determine the faraday angle one should separate the coherent part that is the one directed on @xmath9 , see fig.1 .",
    "faraday rotation angle is determined as follows @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the components of transmitted coherent wave and @xmath12 means averaging over the realizations of randomness .",
    "the phases of electric field components are strongly fluctuating in contrary to intensities .",
    "therefore for a weakly scattering medium one can approximately take @xmath13 maxwell equation for the electric field has the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the source term and the dielectric tensor is determined as follows @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the antisymmetric tensor , @xmath18 is the gyration vector directed on the magnetic field direction when external field is applied . in the opticaly active medium without external field @xmath19 and is parallel to the direction of photon propagation .",
    "@xmath20 is the random part which is assumed gaussian distributed with @xmath21-correlation function @xmath22 in order to carry out averaging over the randomness it is convenient to express all the quantities through the green s functions @xmath23 as was mentioned , the faraday rotation angle in eqs .",
    "( [ angle ] ) and ( [ inten ] ) is determined by the coherent intensity .",
    "hence , to separate the coherent intensities let introduce the intensity tensor at observation point @xmath24 and in the direction of unit vector @xmath25 following @xcite @xmath26 using eq.([inttens ] ) the faraday angle , eq.([inten ] ) , can be represented in terms of a intensity tensor @xmath27 @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the unit vector on @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the thickness of the slab . because of the symmetry the intensities depend only on the @xmath30 coordinate .",
    "averaged green s functions take into account the fact that the right - hand and the left - hand circular polarized lights see different refractive indexes in the medium @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is a unit vector on @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the photon elastic mean free path .",
    "the superscripts r and a denote retarded and advanced green s functions , respectively .",
    "faraday angle consists of two main contributions .",
    "one comes from the coherent potential approximation and another from the diffusional scattering of photon .",
    "coherent potential contribution reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 the source term @xmath39 is chosen in such a way that the coherent part of transmitted electric field for @xmath40 be equal @xmath41 using eqs.([avgreen ] ) and ( [ chpart ] ) , provided that @xmath42 , one finds @xmath43 substituting this expression into eq.([bare ] ) and eq.([cohap ] ) in the limit @xmath44 and @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath45 ,   \\label{cohan}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "it follows from eq.([cohan ] ) that coherent potential approximation contribution , under the conditions @xmath44 and @xmath42 , becomes inessential because contains strongly oscillating term @xmath47 when @xmath48 .",
    "hence , any averaging over the wavelength of incident photon will make this contribution negligible .",
    "therefore below we concentrate our attention on the diffusional contribution to the faraday rotation angle .",
    "using eq.([inttens ] ) , we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the sum of ladder diagrams    ) and the solid lines are the photon retarded and advanced averaged green s functions eq.([avgreen ] ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    which was found in innumerable papers , see for example , @xcite . we will calculate the intensity tensor in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to calculate the diffusion propagator for @xmath40 . the main contribution to the integrals in eq.([difcon ] ) gives the term containing the diffusion pole .",
    "the corresponding mode has the form ( see for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 here @xmath2 is the inelastic mean free path of a photon in the medium and it is assumed that @xmath55 .",
    "fourier transforming eq.([difcon ] ) , substituting the expression @xmath56 into it , and using eq.([bare ] ) , one obtains @xmath57 where @xmath58 the integral over @xmath59 can be calculated exactly closing the integral contour in the complex @xmath59 plane in the upper half ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "note that the contributions from the poles @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the sum over polarizations cancel each other in the limit @xmath51 and @xmath42 . substituting eq.([greenz ] ) into eq.([intens ] ) and subsequently calculating the integrals over @xmath59 and @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64 in deriving this expression we assume that @xmath65 , however @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath66 can be calculated in the same way as @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the @xmath40 approximation can be used , because @xmath67 is already proportional to @xmath68 . substituting eq.([bare ] ) into eq.([intens ] ) , one has @xmath69 using the above calculated expressions for @xmath67 , @xmath66 and eq.([angten ] ) , we finally obtain the desired result for the faraday rotation angle with the diffusional contribution @xmath70 equation ( [ final ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ diffcross ] ) ( see below ) represent the central results of this work .",
    "@xmath71 presents the asymptotically exact ( @xmath72 , @xmath42 ) expression for the faraday rotation in 3d disordered systems . comparing the two formulae , @xmath73 and @xmath71",
    ", we see that the latter oscillates less , due to the fact that @xmath51 in the argument of the @xmath74 function .",
    "therefore , the diffusion contribution to the faraday rotation , eq.([final ] ) , will dominate compared to the coherent potential approximation contribution , eq.([cohan ] ) .",
    "this is valid provided that diffusional scattering is realized in the disordered system .",
    "we remind that eq.([final ] ) has been derived assuming that @xmath75 however @xmath76 is not necessarily small .",
    "it is worth noticing that the ratio @xmath77 is the average number of scatterings of the photon in the medium .",
    "if the thickness @xmath31 of a slab is thinner than the length @xmath78 then the diffusional trajectories are cut on the system size and the above mentioned number of scatterings becomes equal to @xmath79 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this particular case , eq.([final ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath80 taking into account that in the diffusional regime the transmission coefficient @xmath81 of a disordered slab is of order @xmath82 .",
    "it follows from eqs.([final ] ) and ( [ final1 ] ) that the maximum of the faraday angle is achieved at the frequencies where the photon elastic mean free path @xmath3 is minimal . in the case of eq .",
    "( [ final1 ] ) ( @xmath83 ) , it is obvious that the maximum of the faraday rotation corresponds to the minimum of the transmission coefficient and in its proximity .",
    "this type of dependence was confirmed experimentally in refs .",
    "however the faraday rotation peak will be steeper because of stronger dependence on @xmath84 ( see below for more details ) .",
    "another pecularity of our result , eq.([final ] ) , is that it implies an oscillating dependence of the rotation on @xmath68 , that is on a magnetic field , or the medium s internal properties .",
    "note that the non - monotonous dependence of the faraday rotation on the magnetic field is observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "for completeness , we now turn to the discussion of the faraday rotation angle for the backscattered wave using the procedure outlined above . the main difference now is that one should take into account the contribution of the maximally - crossed diagrams ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) in fig.2 , which goes beyond the ladder diagram approximation , ( i.e. , regular diffusion ) . another important point to mention also is that in the kerr effect the boundary conditions at @xmath85 are important .    for a brief sketch of the derivation of the backscattering peak note , that the diffusion propagator @xmath86 should fulfill the boundary condition at @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , instead of the former @xmath87 , we , based on the method of images , use a modified @xmath88 . here",
    "@xmath89 is a two dimensional vector in the @xmath90 plane and we assume that the following inequalities are met : @xmath44 , @xmath42 and @xmath91 the details of the calculations of the backscattering rotation is given in appendices a and b. the final result ( @xmath92 , i.e. no absorption ) reads @xmath93 where @xmath94 are the diffusional and maximally crossed diagrams contribution to the faraday rotation angle of the backscattered light , respectively . note that maximally - crossed diagrams leads to a pure imaginary faraday angle which indicates the onset of ellipticity for the backscattered wave . as is seen from eq.([diffcross ] )",
    "the diffusional contribution is dominant in the diffusion regime @xmath42 in contrary to the maximally crossed diagrams contribution which becomes relatively large in the localized regime @xmath95 . in this regime ,",
    "@xmath95 , the diffusional and maximally crossed diagrams contributions are of the same order and maximum of rotation angle is achieved .",
    "physically , such a behavior can be understood within the existing relation between the faraday rotation angle and the time spent by the light in a medium @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "indeed , in the diffusive regime the backscattering time is larger for low scatterer concentration ( or for larger photon mean free path ) . with increasing the scatterer concentration ( the photon mean free path becomes smaller ) the backscattering time increases because of the localization effects ( or because of the ellipticity of the polarization of the reflected wave ) .",
    "this transparent picture serves as a basis for qualitative understanding of asymptotic behavior of backscattered wave in two regimes .",
    "thus , the onset of ellipticity in the backscattered wave can serve as a precursor of light weak localization .    note , that in the limit @xmath96 the diffusional and maximally crossed diagrams contributions to the rotation angle of backscattering wave are very small ( see eqs .",
    "( [ idfinal ] ) and ( [ maxcontr ] ) ) .",
    "hence for the backscattered wave the maximal rotation is achieved for @xmath97 .    in concluding this section ,",
    "let us estimate the traversal time of an electromagnetic wave in 3d disordered media .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite the interaction time in a slab is closely related to the faraday rotation .",
    "hence , one might expect , that the traversal time , @xmath98 , of an electromagnetic wave through a 3d disordered slab will be larger compared with the time , @xmath99 , spent in a dielectric with open boundaries . following ref .",
    "@xcite and expanding eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) in powers of @xmath68 , and keeping linear terms only we get an estimated value for time @xmath100 thus , the disorder enhanced the traversal time @xmath98 by an additional factor @xmath77 , in comparison with a free light propagation time @xmath101 .",
    "most of the experiments on faraday rotation in disordered media @xcite-@xcite are carried out with the films of thicknesses much less than the light wavelengths .",
    "our approach can not be directly applied to these systems because the randomness in this case is nearly two - dimensional contrary to our @xmath102 randomness .",
    "we will compare our results with the experimental data of the work ref .",
    "@xcite , where the sample has @xmath102 randomness .",
    "first let us estimate the dimensionless constant @xmath68 for a water noting that in ref .",
    "@xcite nanoparticles are randomly embedded in the water .",
    "it follows from ( [ greenz ] ) that @xmath103 and @xmath104 . @xmath105 and @xmath106 are dielectric constants and refraction indexes of right - hand and left - hand circularly polarized light at @xmath107 wavelength , respectively . the difference @xmath108 is related to the verdet constant @xmath109 : @xmath110 . taking @xmath111 , one has @xmath112 . for a water at @xmath113,@xmath114 and @xmath115 ,",

    "therefore @xmath116 .",

    "the elastic photon mean free path @xmath3 in a system of randomly embedded in a dielectric host medium of metallic spheres can be estimated as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the volume of a single sphere and @xmath119 is the volume fraction of spheres in the medium @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the average size of particles coated with gold in an aggregate state and @xmath122 @xcite . substituting these values and @xmath113 into expression of @xmath3 ,",

    "the additional large multiplier @xmath132 arises in the verdet constant calculated within the effective maxwell - garnett theory .",
