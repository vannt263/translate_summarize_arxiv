    "<S> the main contribution to the large peak _ c _ comes from the transition @xmath113 which corresponds to @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the peak hight of @xmath114 which in turn corresponds to a phonon number @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> the individual transitions can not be resolved because the lines are broadened due to the finite damping of the cnt . </S>",
    "<S> note however that a finite damping is essential to allow for non - resonant transitions which enable population of higher state . </S>",
    "<S> the large energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state due to the nonlinearity of the spectrum is the reason why the two spin states @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be resolved .    in figure ( </S>",

    "<S> qualitatively , the same features are observed as for @xmath71 but in this case the integrated amplitude for the initial state @xmath118 is larger because of the thermal distribution of oscillator in @xmath119 , containing a small admixture of @xmath120 and higher states , in addition to @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the width of the peak is only little affected by the finite temperature and is still goverend by the damping of the cnt .    to achieve the most efficient read - out scheme we strive to increase the contrast in the integrated amplitude between spin up and down . a way to achieve this is to change the driving frequency as a function of time </S>",
    "<S> this compensates for the fact that the frequencies of higher transitions are smaller than those of the lower transitions . from figure ( [ fig : jc - ladder_and_zero_temperature]a ) </S>",
    "<S> we see that the transition frequencies between states of same parity scales with @xmath121 ( see above ) . for the sake of simplicity in the following </S>",
    "<S> we change the frequency once to demonstrate the principle , but this method could be optimized to further increase the contrast . to achieve the maximum contrast , i.e. the difference between the integrated amplitudes for the two initial states with different spin orientations , we switch the frequency at the point right before the squared amplitude reaches its maximum . </S>",

    "<S> the variable driving scheme results in an increase in current by a factor of about 2.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the result is shown in figure ( [ fig : variable_driving]a ) . </S>",
