    "social network analysis , one of the most studied subjects in the last decade , has been applied in very different contexts ranging from online social networks  @xcite , over networks of fictitious comic characters  @xcite to animal social networks  @xcite . here",
    "we present a study about connections of a different form .",
    "we use neither self - reported nor observed relations nor interactions inferred from activity logs .",
    "we focus on the links between notable humans as they are recorded in collective memory . to extract these connections and build the corresponding networks we use different language versions of wikipedia , which can be seen as _ global memory place",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we exploit direct links between biographic articles as evidence of relations between the corresponding persons , and build biographical social networks for the 15 largest language versions of wikipedia .",
    "we investigate these networks separately and analyse their similarity .",
    "we furthermore extract the most important persons according to several centrality metrics in these networks .",
    "this allows us to analyse and compare the different language communities over their perception and reporting of connections between notable persons .",
    "the visualisation of the shared links present in most of the different language networks highlights the connections commonly known across language and culture barriers .",
    "social networks analysis on wikipedia has mainly exploited editor interactions , either via generating co - authorship networks  @xcite or analysing social interactions on article and user talk - pages  @xcite .",
    "additionally , co - authorship has been used to create networks of similar articles  @xcite .",
    "the link structure of wikipedia articles has been studied extensively : common features have been found in the network topology of several language versions of wikipedia  @xcite , and rankings of the most central entries in the english wikipedia have been presented  @xcite .",
    "the idea of restricting the network to articles representing entities of a given type has been followed in  @xcite , introducing a framework for visualising links between philosophers in the english wikipedia .",
    "different language versions of wikipedia have been compared to study cultural differences among their communities  @xcite . while this has been done mostly by analysing the behaviour of the editors ,",
    "here we propose to study differences and similarities as they emerge from the link structure of the artifacts created by different communities .",
    "to obtain a list of articles about persons on the english wikipedia , we relied on a dataset from dbpedia[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "the dataset contains links to 296  511 existing english articles , which we parsed to identify the names of the corresponding articles in the other 14 language versions of wikipedia with the largest number of articles at the moment we extracted the data ( september 8 to 13 , 2011 ) .    for each language version we generated a directed network where nodes represent persons with a biographical wikipedia article and a node @xmath0 links to node @xmath1 if the article of the person @xmath0 is linking to the article about person @xmath1 .",
    "as many wikipedia articles have alternative names which redirect to the same article , we had to track these redirects for every person and every language with a script provided by the wikimedia toolserver.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the number of redirects per page follows a heavy tailed distribution as can be observed in figure  [ fig : redirects_stats ] .",
    "the table embedded in the figure lists the 13 persons with the largest number of redirects in the english wikipedia .",
    "the article about muammar al - gaddafi leads the ranking with 251 different ways of linking towards it , more than doubling the redirects of osama bin laden , the second ranked person .",
    "in this section we study global metrics calculated for the biographical networks of different languages .",
    "we also discuss rankings based on various definitions of centrality .",
    "in particular , we present the most central ( linked ) persons in the different language wikipedia .",
    "finally , we compare the similarities between the different language networks .      a brief overview of the principal social network measures for the different language networks is given in table  [ tab : nw_measures ] .",
    "the largest network corresponds to the english wikipedia with nearly @xmath2 nodes .",
    "the second largest , extracted from the german wikipedia , is only about one - third as large .",
    "all language networks show very low clustering .",
    "the only outstanding network is the chinese with a clustering coefficient of @xmath3 , which indicates an important structural difference of the link structure in this language version .    by looking at the link",
    "reciprocities we find that it is quite rare that two persons are mutually connected .",
    "one of the possible causes of this observation may be the presence of parasocial interactions  @xcite , i.e. one - sided interpersonal relationships in which one part knows a great deal about the other , but the other does not .",
    "e.g. , when a person is influenced by the works of somebody who died decades before .",
    "we see that all networks are well connected , as the percentage of nodes in the giant component ( gc ) lies between 85% ( polish ) and 96% ( french and japanese ) .",
    "when calculating the average path length between two persons in the @xmath4 we observe that the largest average distances are found for the polish and russian networks .    .",
    "properties of the language networks ordered by network size : number of ( not isolated ) nodes @xmath5 and edges @xmath6 , average clustering coefficient @xmath7 , percentage of nodes in the giant component gc , average path - length between nodes @xmath8 , reciprocity @xmath9 and maximal distance @xmath10 between two nodes in the network . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section we focus on centrality metrics for the above defined biographical networks . in table",
    "[ tab : top_indegree ] we present the top - ranked persons according to the degree centrality for the english wikipedia .",
    "we also provide results for other centrality measures together with the corresponding rankings .",
    "betweenness measures the fraction of shortest paths between other pairs of nodes passing through a given node , while pagerank gives a measure of the global importance of nodes , computed recursively putting a larger weight on incoming connections from central nodes .",
    "we find many american presidents , iconic american musicians , and european leaders during the ww2 period among the most linked .",
    "interestingly , we observe that pope john paul  ii appears to be a more central figure than jesus .",
    "comparing the number of incoming and outgoing links , we observe that in - degrees are of an order of magnitude greater than out - degrees .",
    "we explain this phenomenon again by the presence of the parasocial relations . for betweenness and pagerank",
    "we do not find large differences in the rankings .",
    "the only exception is shakespeare , whose low betweenness value can be caused by the low number of out - going links .",
    "interestingly , shakespeare s page is one of the most central for several languages ( see table  [ tab : top_betweenness ] ) , but not for english .    in table",
    "[ tab : top_betweenness ] we show the most central characters in wikipedia for the 15 analysed languages ranked by the betweenness centrality .",
    "we observe that most of the presented persons are known to be ( or have been ) highly influential in many aspects .",
    "thus , in these lists we find political leaders , revolutionaries , famous musicians , writers and actors .",
    "we note that political figures such as adolf hitler , george w. bush or barack obama dominate in almost all top rankings .",
    "interestingly , william shakespeare and michael jackson are also among the central figures for several languages .    for many languages",
    "we find , however , that the top ranked persons reflect country specific issues .",
    "thus , for example , pope john paul ii is only present in the top five list of the italian and polish wikipedia , two countries which have a special tie with this figure . in the english wikipedia",
    "the most central figures are former us presidents , while the spanish - speaking wikipedia community marks out latin american revolutionaries .",
    "the russian version surprisingly highlights william shakespeare and also kenneth branagh , known for several film adaptations of shakespeare s plays .",
    "only the japanese wikipedia rankes the author mishima prominently , while two chinese leaders , chiang kai - shek and deng xiaopin , are in the top-5 in the chinese version .",
    "when looking at these results , it should be taken into account that there is an anglo - saxon bias in the dataset , as we relied on a list of notable persons extracted from the english wikipedia , and persons from other cultures not know internationally might be missing . in that sense",
    "the above list reflects centrality among persons with at least limited international notoriety .    .",
    "]          in this section we focus on similarities between the networks emerging from the different language wikipedias .",
    "we calculate the similarity for every pair of networks as their jaccard coefficient , i.e. the ratio between the number of links present in both networks ( their intersection ) and the number of links existing in their union .",
    "table  [ tab : jaccard ] shows the obtained similarity results . for every language row",
    "we highlight the two languages with the largest similarities . the most similar language is also underlined .",
    "figure  [ fig : jaccard_network ] further illustrates these similarities by drawing a language similarity network . in this network a language @xmath11 is connected to another language @xmath12 if language @xmath12 is one of the two most similar to @xmath11 . applying the louvain method , we divide this graph into three clusters . in agreement with  @xcite",
    ", we observe that most of the links can be explained by language - family relations ( e.g romance and slavic languages ) and geographic or historical ties ( e.g. scandinavian group , or russia and finland ) .",
    "we also find a number of less obvious connections , e.g. japanese to spanish and finnish to dutch .",
    "in fact , dutch seems to serve as a bridge between different language and culture groups .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : the_network ] depicts the network of connections which are present in at least 13 of the 15 language wikipedias .",
    "the network is relatively small , containing 1663 nodes and 1738 links , but allows to visualise the quintessence of knowledge about biographical connections present in most of the analysed language communities .",
    "the largest connected component in figure  [ fig : the_network ] corresponds to a cluster of us presidents which connects over ronald reagan to a cluster of british premier ministers .",
    "this group is related through winston churchill to a cluster of persons from ww2 s axis powers .",
    "the second largest component is compound of several clusters related to the music and entertainment business , and the third one of two clusters of male and female tennis players connected through dinara and marat safin .",
    "other large isolated clusters can be found around such diverse groups as russian and chinese political figures , french presidents , israeli and palestinian politicians , formula one pilots , world chess champions or actresses .",
    "our results show that biographical connections are recorded differently in the distinct language versions of wikipedia .",
    "although the global social network measures are largely similar for all these networks , the most central persons unveil interesting peculiarities about the language communities .",
    "a study of similarity reveals that networks are more similar for geographically or linguistically closer communities .",
    "nevertheless , there also exists a great number of biographical connections which can be found in most of the analysed language wikipedias .",
    "knowledge about these social connections trespasses cultural barriers and represents part of the shared global collective memory of our civilisation .",
    "possible directions for future work include the application of the methodology to generate subnetworks of other kinds of article categories , and a specific study of links present in most networks but missing only in a few language wikipedias .    finally , the gender gap among wikipedia editors is a serious concern for the community , and has been related to the topics covered in the encyclopedia  @xcite .",
    "our results point out a very small presence of females also among the most central persons in the encyclopedic content , suggesting the link between these two phenomena as an intriguing subject for future investigation .",
    "this work was partially supported by the spanish centre for the development of industrial technology under the cenit program , project cen-20101037 , `` social media '' .",
