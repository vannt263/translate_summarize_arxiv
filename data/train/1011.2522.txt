    "in studies of nonlinear wave dynamics in physical systems , nonlinear schrdinger ( nls)-type equations play a prominent role .",
    "it is known that a weakly nonlinear one - dimensional wave packet in a generic physical system is governed by the nls equation @xcite .",
    "hence this equation appears frequently in nonlinear optics and water waves @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the nonlinear interaction of atoms in bose - einstein condensates is governed by a nls - type equation as well ( called gross - pitaevskii equation in the literature ) @xcite . in these physical systems ,",
    "the nonlinearity can be focusing or defocusing ( i.e. , the nonlinear coefficient can be positive or negative ) , depending on the physical situations @xcite or the types of atoms in bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "when two wave packets in a physical system or two types of atoms in bose - einstein condensates interact with each other , their interaction then is governed by two coupled nls equations @xcite .",
    "the single nls equation is exactly integrable @xcite .",
    "it admits bright solitons in the focusing case , and dark solitons in the defocusing case .",
    "its bright @xmath0-soliton solutions were given in @xcite , and its dark @xmath0-soliton solutions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the coupled nls equations are also integrable when the nonlinear coefficients have the same magnitudes @xcite . in these integrable cases ,",
    "if all nonlinear terms are of focusing type ( i.e. , the nonlinear coefficients are all positive ) , the coupled nls equations are the focusing manakov model which admits bright - bright solitons @xcite .",
    "if all nonlinear terms are of defocusing type ( i.e. , the nonlinear coefficients are all negative ) , the coupled nls equations are the defocusing manakov model which admits bright - dark and dark - dark solitons @xcite .",
    "if the focusing and defocusing nonlinearities are mixed ( i.e. , the nonlinear coefficients have opposite signs ) , these coupled nls equations admit bright - bright solitons @xcite and bright - dark solitons @xcite .",
    "existence of dark - dark solitons in this mixed case has not been investigated yet .",
    "soliton interaction in these integrable generally coupled nls equations is a fascinating subject . in the focusing manakov model",
    ", an interesting phenomenon is that bright solitons change their polarizations ( i.e. relative energy distributions among the two components ) after collision @xcite . in the coupled nls equations with mixed nonlinearities , energy can also transfer from one soliton to another after collision @xcite .",
    "in addition , solitons can be reflected off by each other as well @xcite . in the defocusing manakov model",
    ", two bright - dark solitons can form a stationary bound state , a phenomenon which does not occur for scalar bright or dark solitons @xcite .",
    "all these interesting interaction behaviors can be described by multi - soliton solutions in the underlying integrable system . in the focusing manakov model ,",
    "@xmath0-bright - bright solitons were derived in @xcite by the inverse scattering transform method . in the mixed - nonlinearity model ,",
    "two- and three - bright - bright solitons and two - bright - dark solitons were derived in @xcite by the hirota method , and @xmath0-bright - bright solitons were derived in @xcite by the riemann - hilbert method . in the defocusing manakov model , @xmath0-bright - dark solitons were derived in @xcite , and degenerate two - dark - dark solitons were derived in @xcite , both by the hirota method .",
    "so far , progress on dark - dark solitons in the integrable generally coupled nls equations is very limited . while dark - dark solitons in the defocusing manakov model were derived in @xcite",
    ", we will show that their two- and higher - dark - dark solitons are actually degenerate and reducible to scalar dark solitons . in @xcite ,",
    "the inverse scattering transform method was developed for dark solitons in the defocusing manakov model .",
    "but , as we will show in this paper , their analysis can not yield general dark - dark solitons either due to their choices of the boundary conditions . to date , general multi - dark - dark solitons in the coupled nls equations have never been reported yet ( to our knowledge ) .",
    "as we will see , these general multi - dark - dark solitons are not easy to obtain due to non - trivial parameter constraints which must be met .    in this paper ,",
    "we comprehensively analyze dark - dark solitons and their dynamics in the generally coupled integrable nls equations .",
    "first , we show that these coupled nls equations can be obtained as a reduction of the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) hierarchy .",
    "then using @xmath1-function solutions of the kp hierarchy , we derive the general @xmath0-dark - dark solitons in terms of gram determinants .",
    "these dark - dark solitons exist in both the defocusing manakov model and the mixed - nonlinearity model . recalling that bright - bright solitons exist in the mixed - nonlinearity model as well @xcite , we see that the coupled nls equations with mixed nonlinearities are the rare integrable systems which admit both bright - bright and dark - dark solitons .",
    "the dark - dark solitons obtained previously in @xcite for the defocusing manakov model are only degenerate cases of our general solutions .",
    "next , we analyze properties of these soliton solutions . for single dark - dark solitons ,",
    "we show that the degrees of  darkness \" in their two components are different in general .",
    "when two dark - dark solitons collide with each other , we show that energies in the two components of each soliton completely transmit through .",
    "this contrasts collisions of bright - bright solitons in these same equations , where polarization rotation , power transfer and soliton reflection can occur @xcite . thus dark - dark solitons are much more robust than bright - bright solitons with regard to collision . in the case of",
    "focusing and defocusing nonlinearities , an interesting phenomenon is that two dark - dark solitons can form a stationary bound state .",
    "this is the first report of dark - dark - soliton bound states in integrable systems .",
    "however , three or more dark - dark solitons can not form bound states , as we will show in this paper .",
    "we should mention that this kp - hierarchy reduction for deriving soliton solutions in integrable systems was first developed by the kyoto school in the 1970s @xcite .",
    "so far , this method has been applied to derive bright solitons in many equations such as nls , modified kdv , davey - stewartson equations @xcite .",
    "this method has also been applied to derive @xmath0-dark solitons in the defocusing nls equation @xcite .",
    "but this reduction for dark - dark solitons in the generally coupled nls equations is more subtle and has never been done before . in this paper",
    ", we will derive general @xmath0-dark - dark solitons by this kp - hierarchy reduction and the grace of deep use of determinant expressions .",
    "compared to the inverse scattering transform method @xcite and the hirota method @xcite , our treatment is much more clean , and the solution formulae much more elegant and general .",
    "thus , the kp - reduction method has a distinct advantage in derivations of dark - soliton solutions .",
    "the generally coupled integrable nls equations we investigate in this paper are @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real coefficients .",
    "this system is integrable @xcite . through @xmath5 and @xmath6 scalings , the nonlinear coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be normalized to be @xmath7 without loss of generality . when @xmath8 , this system is the focusing manakov model which supports bright - bright solitons @xcite . when @xmath9 , this system is the defocusing manakov model which supports bright - dark and dark - dark solitons @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 and @xmath3 have opposite signs , the system exhibits mixed focusing and defocusing nonlinearities . in this case , these equations support bright - bright solitons @xcite , bright - dark solitons @xcite , and dark - dark solitons ( as we will see below ) .    in this section",
    ", we derive the general formulae for @xmath0-dark - dark solitons in the integrable coupled nls system .",
    "the basic idea is to treat eq . as a reduction of the kp hierarchy .",
    "then dark solitons in eq . can be obtained from solutions of the kp hierarchy under this reduction . for this purpose ,",
    "let us first review gram - type solutions for equations in the kp hierarchy @xcite .",
    "consider the following equations in the kp hierarchy @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hirota derivative defined by @xmath12 @xmath13 is a complex constant , @xmath14 is an integer , and @xmath15 is a function of three independent variables @xmath16 .",

    "the first equation in is the bilinear equation for the two - dimensional toda lattice ( see p.984 of @xcite and p.4130 of @xcite ) , and the second equation in is the lowest - degree bilinear equation in the 1st modified kp hierarchy ( see p.996 of @xcite ) .",
    "since the two - dimensional toda lattice hierarchy and modified kp hierarchies are closely related to the ( single - component ) kp hierarchy , all these hierarchies will be called the kp hierarchy in this paper . regarding the parameter @xmath13 in the second equation in",
    ", it corresponds to the wave - number shift @xmath23 in @xcite [ see eq . ( 10.3 ) there ] .",
    "the bilinear equation with this parameter was not explicitly written down in @xcite , but can be found in @xcite [ see eq . ( n-3 ) there ] .",
    "this parameter can be formally removed by the galilean transformation for @xmath24 in .",
    "but for our purpose , it proves to be important to keep this parameter , as it will pave the way for the introduction of another similar parameter @xmath25 in lemma 2 later . in that case ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath25 can not be removed simultaneously by the galilean transformation , and they are essential for the construction of non - degenerate dark - dark solitons in the generally coupled nls system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) .",

    "thus in this paper , we will always take @xmath131 to avoid this singularity .",
    "we would like to make four remarks here .",
    "the first remark is on the above derivation of dark solitons through kp - hierarchy reduction .",
    "this derivation is non - trivial . to better understand it ,",
    "we can split it into two parts .",
    "one part is the reduction of the bilinear equations ( [ ( 2.6 ) ] ) of the generally coupled nls equations from the kp - hierarchy equations ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) .",
    "the other part is the reduction of the soliton solutions to the bilinear equations ( [ ( 2.6 ) ] ) from the @xmath1-solutions ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) of the kp - hierarchy equations ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) . in the first part , when we impose on the @xmath1-functions the conjugation constraint [ see ( [ conjugation_constraint_0 ] ) ] @xmath132 and the linear constraint [ see ( [ ( 2.81 ) ] ) ] @xmath133 and set @xmath134 with @xmath135 being real , then one can readily verify that the kp - hierarchy equations ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) reduce to the bilinear equations ( [ ( 2.6 ) ] ) of the coupled nls equations . in the second part , in order for the @xmath1-functions ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) to satisfy the conjugation constraint ( [ conjugation_constraint ] ) , it is sufficient to require [ see ( [ conjugation_constraint_0 ] ) ] @xmath136 a sufficient condition for ( [ mji_ij ] ) to hold is that @xmath137 @xmath66 are real , and @xmath67 are pure imaginary .",
    "these conditions are the same ones we imposed at the beginning of the proof of theorem 1 . under these conditions , the @xmath1-solutions ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) of the kp - hierarchy equations ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) then reduce to the solutions ( [ ( 2.7 ) ] ) for the bilinear equations ( [ ( 2.6 ) ] ) of the coupled nls equations . in order for the @xmath1-functions ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) to satisfy the linear constraint ( [ linear_constraint ] ) , by rewriting these @xmath1-functions as ( [ ( 2.800 ) ] ) and inserting them into this linear constraint , we then get the parameter constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) , which is equivalent to the parameter constraint ( [ theorem2_constraints ] ) in theorem 1 .",
    "this splitting of the earlier derivation of dark solitons into these two parts helps to clarify this derivation and make it more understandable .",
    "the second remark is on the solution form ( [ ( 2.9 ) ] ) of dark solitons in the generally coupled nls equations .",
    "it is known that the nls equation of focusing type is a reduction of the two - component kp hierarchy ( see @xcite , page 966 and 999 ) , and the nls equation of defocusing type is a reduction of the single - component kp hierarchy @xcite .",
    "it is also known that solutions to the single - component kp hierarchy can be expressed as single wronskians @xcite , and solutions to the two - component kp hierarchy can be expressed as double wronskians @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath0-bright solitons in the focusing nls equation can be expressed as double wronskians @xcite , and @xmath0-dark solitons in the defocusing nls equation can be expressed as single wronskians @xcite .",
    "these wronskian solutions can also be expressed as gram - type determinants @xcite .",
    "for the vector generalization of the nls equation , in order to obtain its @xmath0-bright - soliton solutions , one should increase the number of components , and take as a reduction of the three - component kp hierarchy .",
    "thus @xmath0-bright solitons in can be expressed as three - component wronskians ( or the corresponding gram - type determinants @xcite ) . but to obtain @xmath0-dark solitons in eqs .",
    ", one should increase copies of independent variables to @xmath44 and @xmath43 in the single - component kp hierarchy [ see eqs .",
    "( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) ] , thus @xmath0-dark solitons in eqs . can still be expressed as single wronskian ( or the corresponding gram determinant ) as we have done above .",
    "the third remark we make is on comparison of the kp - hierarchy reduction method and the inverse scattering method for deriving dark - soliton solutions .",
    "as is well known , the inverse scattering method is another way to derive soliton solutions .",
    "for bright solitons , the inverse scattering method ( or its modern riemann - hilbert formulation ) is a powerful way to derive such solutions ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "recently , bright - bright @xmath0-solitons in a very general class of integrable coupled nls equations were easily derived by this method @xcite , and eqs .",
    "are special cases of such general equations .",
    "but for dark solitons , the inverse scattering method is more difficult due to non - vanishing boundary conditions , which create branch cuts and other related intricacies in the scattering process @xcite . in @xcite , the inverse scattering",
    "transform analysis was developed for the defocusing manakov equations [ @xmath138 in ] with non - vanishing boundary conditions .",
    "but in their analysis , the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) were taken such that @xmath139 [ see their equation ( 2.3 ) ] ( actually @xmath140 was taken there , but the case of @xmath141 can be reduced to the case of @xmath140 through galilean transformation ) .",
    "when @xmath139 , one can see from our general formula ( [ ( 2.9 ) ] ) that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are simply proportional to each other , thus their inverse scattering analysis could only obtain degenerate dark - dark solitons which are reducible to scalar dark solitons in the defocusing nls equation . in order to derive the more general dark - dark solitons ( [ ( 2.9 ) ] ) with @xmath142 , the inverse scattering method would be even more complicated than that in @xcite . comparatively , the kp - hierarchy reduction method we used above is free of these difficulties , and is thus a simpler method for deriving dark - soliton solutions .",
    "our last remark is on dark solitons in an even more general coupled nls equations @xmath143 where @xmath144 are real constants as in , and @xmath145 is a complex constant . if @xmath146 , ( [ more_general ] ) reduces to ) .",
    "this more general coupled nls system ( [ more_general ] ) is also integrable .",
    "its lax pair as well as @xmath0-bright - bright solitons are given in @xcite .",
    "to explore dark - dark solitons in this system , we look for solutions with the following large - distance asymptotics [ as in ( [ ( 2.9 ) ] ) ] @xmath147 } , \\\\",
    "v\\to \\nu e^{i[dx-\\kappa t ] } , \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\quad x \\to -\\infty , \\label{large_x}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 are non - zero complex constants , and @xmath149 are real constants . inserting this asymptotic solution into ( [ more_general ] )",
    ", we see that due to the @xmath145-terms , eqs .",
    "( [ more_general ] ) can hold only if @xmath139 , and @xmath150 .",
    "based on the previous solutions ( [ ( 2.9 ) ] ) , this would imply that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components of dark - dark solitons in the general system ( [ more_general ] ) must be proportional to each other , thus are equivalent to scalar dark solitons in the defocusing nls equation . except these trivial dark - dark solitons , eqs .",
    "( [ more_general ] ) do not admit other dark - dark solitons of the form ( [ large_x ] ) when @xmath151 .",
    "this is a dramatic difference between the cases of @xmath146 and @xmath151 in eqs .",
    "( [ more_general ] ) . whether the general system ( [ more_general ] ) admits dark - dark solitons with background asymptotics different from ( [ large_x ] ) is still unclear .",
    "in what follows , we investigate the dynamics of single - dark - soliton and two - dark - soliton solutions in the generally coupled nls equations . in the analysis of these solutions ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 will be treated as arbitrary parameters . in the illustrations of solutions in the figures",
    ", we will pick @xmath152 which correspond to mixed focusing and defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "the reason for this choice is that dark solitons under such mixed nonlinearities have never been studied before .",
    "we will show that under these mixed nonlinearities , some novel phenomena ( such as existence of two - dark - soliton bound states ) would arise .",
    "soliton dynamics under other @xmath3 and @xmath4 values , such as in the defocusing manakov equations where @xmath138 , would also be briefly discussed when appropriate .      in order to get single dark solitons in eqs . , we set @xmath153 in the formula .",
    "after simple algebra , these single dark solitons can be written as @xmath154 } \\left[1+y_1+(y_1 - 1)\\tanh(\\frac{\\theta_1+\\bar\\theta_1+\\rho_1}{2})\\right ] , \\end{array } \\label{(3.1)}\\ ] ] @xmath155 } \\left[1+z_1+(z_1 - 1)\\tanh(\\frac{\\theta_1+\\bar\\theta_1+\\rho_1}{2})\\right ] , \\end{array } \\label{(3.2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath156 @xmath157 and @xmath158 are complex constants satisfying @xmath159 or equivalently , @xmath160 is given by formula ( [ aj_formula ] ) , where @xmath161 .",
    "this soliton would be singular if @xmath162 , i.e. , @xmath163 .",
    "thus we will require @xmath164 below to avoid singular solutions .",

    "thus collisions between bright - bright solitons and between dark - dark solitons in the coupled nls system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) are distinctly different .",
    "the reason for this complete energy transmission in all components in dark - soliton collisions is that the intensity profile of each dark - dark soliton is completely characterized by the background parameters @xmath205 and the soliton parameter @xmath63 [ see eqs .",

    "in studies of dark solitons , multi - dark - soliton bound states is an interesting subject . in the defocusing nls equation ,",

    "so far , multi - dark - dark - soliton bound states have never been reported in integrable systems . in a non - integrable system ,",

    "when two such dark - dark solitons weakly overlap with each other and interact , their non - monotonic tails create local minima in the effective interaction potential , hence the two dark - dark solitons can form stationary bound states .",

    "we show that in the generally coupled nls system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) , when both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are negative , i.e. , all nonlinearities are defocusing ( the defocusing manakov model ) , multi - dark - dark - soliton bound states can not exist .",

    "( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) can be heuristically understood as follows .",
    "we know that in the scalar defocusing nls equation , two dark solitons repel each other . in the coupled nls system ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) , if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both negative , all nonlinearities are defocusing , hence two dark - dark solitons still repel each other , and no bound states can be formed . however ,",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 have opposite signs , parts of the nonlinear terms are focusing , and the other parts defocusing .",
    "while the defocusing terms repel two dark solitons , the focusing terms do just the opposite , which is to attract two dark solitons .",
    "thus , when these repulsive and attractive forces balance each other , two dark - dark solitons then can form a stationary bound state .",
    "this physical mechanism for the existence of dark - dark - soliton bound states is quite different from that in the shg model @xcite ( see earlier text ) .",

    "the total phase shifts of the bound state are equal to the sum of the individual phase shifts of the two constituent dark solitons , which are non - zero in general .",
