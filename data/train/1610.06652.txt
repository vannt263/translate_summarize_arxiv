    "entanglement @xcite is one of the most intriguing feature of quantum mechanics , having myriads of potential applications in quantum information and communication @xcite . so far ,",
    "preparation and manipulation of entanglement has been successfully demonstrated in microscopic systems , such as atoms , photons , ions @xcite etc . however , the validity of entanglement in the macroscopic realm is still a debatable fact . in this",
    "regard , optomechanical system @xcite where a macroscopic mechanical motion interacts with an optical field has emerged as a promising platform to realize entanglement at a macroscopic level .",
    "several studies have been reported to generate entanglement between optical and mechanical mode or two optical modes or two mechanical modes @xcite .",
    "these studies mostly explore entanglement in the steady - state regime of the system where the strength of the entanglement is strictly limited by the stability conditions .",
    "in particular , in this regime entanglement becomes maximum only when the system is driven close to the stability threshold , which demands a strong multi - photon optomechanical coupling or high external laser driving @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite that a two - level system or a nonlinear inductive element ( single - cooper pair transistor ) coupled to an optomechanical system , can significantly enhance the single - photon radiation - pressure coupling .",
    "more importantly , it induces an additional cross - kerr type coupling between the optical and mechanical mode . in nonlinear optics ,",
    "cross - kerr effect describes the change in refractive index of one electromagnetic mode by the intensity of another .",
    "it has been extensively studied in the context of quantum information processing , such as non - demolition photon number detection @xcite , c - not gate @xcite and continuous - variable entanglement concentration @xcite .",
    "concerning optomechanical system , the cross - kerr coupling between the optical and mechanical mode , involves the change in the refractive index of the optical mode depending on the resonators phonon number @xcite .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has showed that this cross - kerr coupling gives rise to a frequency shift in mechanical and optical mode , with the shift depending on the cavity photon number and mechanical phonon number .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of cross - kerr nonlinearity on the stability of the optomechanical system .",
    "along this line , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that in presence of an additional cross - kerr coupling , the steady - state response of the mechanical resonator becomes a nonmonotonous function of cavity photon number and the bistable behavior of the mean cavity photon can be turned into a tristable behavior .",
    "motivated by these works , we study the combined effect of radiation pressure and cross - kerr coupling on the steady - state optomechanical entanglement .",
    "first , we analyze the effect of cross - kerr coupling on the steady - state behavior and the stability conditions of the optomechanical system .",
    "then , we focus on the optomechanical entanglement and find the influence of cross - kerr coupling on it . finally , we discuss the robustness of our scheme with respect to system parameters and environmental temperature .",
    "as depicted in fig . [ fig1 ] , we consider an optomechanical system which consists of an optical and a mechanical mode , respectively , with frequency @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as usual , these two modes are coupled via the generic radiation pressure coupling @xmath2 . in addition , here we consider an extra cross - kerr type coupling @xmath3 between the optical and mechanical mode , generated by a two - level system or a superconducting charge qubit @xcite .",
    "also , the whole system is driven by an external laser of frequency @xmath4 . with this consideration ,",
    "the complete hamiltonian of the optomechanical system in a rotating frame of the laser reads ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 here , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are , respectively , the annihilation ( creation ) operators of the optical and mechanical mode , @xmath11 is the optical detuning and @xmath12 is the driving amplitude , related to driving power @xmath13 and optical decay rate @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , the system dynamics also includes fluctuation - dissipation processes affecting both the optical and mechanical mode .",
    "starting from hamiltonian , the time evolution of the optomechanical system is given by the following nonlinear quantum langevin equations :    [ eq:2 ] @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the mechanical damping rate , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the corresponding zero - mean input gaussian noises , with nonzero correlation functions @xcite , given by :    [ eq:3 ] @xmath20    here , @xmath21 is the mean thermal phonon number , related to boltzmann constant @xmath22 and environmental temperature @xmath23 by : @xmath24^{-1}$ ] .    under intense laser driving",
    ", we now expand each heisenberg operators as a sum of its semi - classical steady - state value plus an additional small fluctuation operator with zero - mean value : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the steady - state values are given by the following nonlinear equations :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the effective optical detuning , modified owing to the both radiation pressure and cross - kerr coupling , and , @xmath29 is the effective mechanical frequency , modified owing to the cross - kerr interaction . as for the fluctuations , their dynamics",
    "is given by the linearized quantum langevin equations @xcite :    [ eq:5 ] @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the effective optomechanical coupling strength with modified @xmath32 .",
    "note that , in the above calculation we have chosen the phase reference of the optical field , such that @xmath33 is real .",
    "next , we introduce the dimensionless quadrature operators , respectively , for the optical and mechanical mode : @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and , similarly for the corresponding hermitian input noise operators : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 . with the above definitions , we express eq . in a more compact form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the vector of continuous variable ( cv ) fluctuation operators , @xmath44 is the drift matrix : @xmath45      -\\tilde{\\omega_b } & -\\gamma & g & 0 \\\\[4 pt ]      0 & 0 & -\\kappa & \\tilde{\\delta } \\\\[4 pt ]      g & 0 & -\\tilde{\\delta } & -\\kappa \\\\[4 pt ]    \\end{array } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath46 is the vector of corresponding noises . a formal solution of eq . is given by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the system is stable and reaches its steady - state when all the eigenvalues of the drift matrix @xmath44 have negative real parts .",
    "these stability conditions are derived by applying the routh - hurwitz criteria @xcite , which is given in terms of the system parameters by the following two nontrivial equations :    [ eq:9 ] @xmath49 + 4g^2\\tilde{\\delta}\\tilde{\\omega_b}(\\gamma+\\kappa)^2>0,\\\\ ( { \\tilde{\\delta}}^2+\\kappa^2)({\\tilde{\\omega_b}}^2+\\gamma^2)-g^2\\tilde{\\delta}\\tilde{\\omega_b}>0.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    note that , in the following work we will strictly restrict to red - detuned driving ( @xmath50 ) , for which the first condition is always satisfied , only the second condition is relevant .",
    "since dynamics is linearized and the initial state of the system is gaussian in nature , the steady - state for the quantum fluctuations is simply a zero - mean gaussian bipartite state , which is fully characterized by its @xmath51 correlation matrix ( cm ) : @xmath52 here , @xmath53 is the vector of cv fluctuation operators in the steady - state @xmath54 . when the system is stable , performing a substitution of eq . in the defination of cm",
    ", we get @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the matrix of stationary noise correlations . using eq .",
    ", @xmath57 further simplifies to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a diagonal matrix , given by : @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath61 , which , when the stability conditions are satisfied ( @xmath62 ) is equivalent to the following lyapunov equation for @xmath63 : @xmath64 note that eq . is a linear equation in @xmath63 which can be straightforwardly solved .",
    "however , an exact analytical expression is too cumbersome and will not be reported here .",
    "indeed , we resort to a numerical solution of @xmath63 .    finally , to study the entanglement between the optical and mechanical mode , we use logarithmic negativity @xmath65 as a computable measure of entanglement @xcite . for a continuous - variable system ,",
    "@xmath65 is defined as @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] is the lowest symplectic eigenvalue of the partial transpose of @xmath63 with @xmath68 , and , we have used @xmath69 block form of the cm : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively corresponds to the mechanical mode , the optical mode and the optomechanical correlation between them . therefore ,",
    "the gaussian state is entangled ( @xmath74 ) if and only if @xmath75 which is equivalent to simon s necessary and sufficient nonpositive partial transpose criteria @xcite .",
    "we start our discussion by considering the effect of cross - kerr coupling on the steady - state behavior of the optomechanical system . to numerically illustrate our result we consider a set of experimentally accessible parameters : @xmath76 thz , @xmath77 mhz , @xmath78 khz , @xmath79 hz , @xmath80 mw and @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we plot the steady - state amplitudes of the optical and mechanical mode along with the stability range of the system ( with @xmath82 ) , as a function of the driving power .",
    "it is clear that for the chosen value of the parameters , both these amplitudes satisfy @xmath83 which ensures the validity of our linearization assumption .",
    "we also note that unlike pure radiation - pressure coupling , now @xmath84 changes drastically with increasing power , as can be explained from eq .",
    "@xcite . in fig . ( 2b ) we plot @xmath85 and @xmath86 against the driving power .",
    "we can see that with increasing power @xmath85 decreases and @xmath86 increases . in particular , at a driving power @xmath87 ( just before the instability ) , we get @xmath88 and @xmath89 . therefore , in presence of cross - kerr coupling , owing to this significant change in the effective mechanical frequency and ( single photon ) coupling strength , the system becomes unstable at a considerably lower driving power .",
    "next , we focus on the steady - state optomechanical entanglement and the influence of cross - kerr coupling on it . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plot @xmath65 as a function of the normalized cross - kerr coupling strength @xmath90 , for a fixed driving power and optical detuning .",
    "we can see that with increasing cross - kerr coupling the degree of entanglement increases and becomes maximum just before the instability .",
    "in particular , for the pure radiation - pressure coupling case ( @xmath91 ) we have @xmath92 . on the other hand ,",
    "in presence of a cross - kerr coupling with coupling strength @xmath82 we obtain @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , by invoking cross - kerr coupling on a generic optomechanical system , we can significantly enhance the degree of steady - state optomechanical entanglement .    to further probe into entanglement properties and its dependence on the system parameters , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath65 as a function of the normalized detuning @xmath94 and normalized driving power @xmath95 , for @xmath91 ( a ) ( no cross - kerr coupling ) , @xmath96 ( b ) , and @xmath97 ( c ) .",
    "we observe that with increasing cross - kerr coupling , the degree of entanglement increases , however , the parameter region in which the steady - state is entangled significantly narrows .",
    "in fact , with increasing cross - kerr coupling the system becomes unstable at a lower driving power , which leads to the significant enhancement of steady - state optomechanical entanglement near the stability threshold .",
    "[ fig5 ] , depicts the same @xmath65 as a function of the normalized optical decay rate @xmath98 and normalized driving power @xmath95 , for @xmath91 ( a ) ( no cross - kerr coupling ) , @xmath96 ( b ) , and @xmath97 ( c ) . here also , we find the enhancement of the steady - state optomechanical with increasing cross - kerr coupling .",
    "however , now the maximum entanglement only occurs for @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "5(c ) ) at higher driving power and lower optical decay rate .",
    "it is also important to note that even in the presence of cross - kerr coupling , we find significant entanglement only in the resolved sideband region , i.e. for @xmath100 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we plot @xmath65 as a function of the mean thermal phonon number @xmath21 .",
    "we observe that the degree of entanglement monotonically decreases with increasing thermal phonon number .",
    "however , the maximum number of thermal phonons up to which entanglement persists increases with increasing cross - kerr coupling .",
    "for example , for the pure radiation - pressure coupling case the entanglement persists up to @xmath101 .",
    "in contrast , in presence of a cross - kerr coupling with coupling strength @xmath82 , we have entanglement up to @xmath102 .",
    "this shows that with the introduction of cross - kerr coupling the bipartite entanglement becomes more robust against the thermal phonon fluctuations .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied in detail the steady - state optomechanical entanglement in presence of an additional cross - kerr coupling between the optical and mechanical mode . within the standard linearized description",
    ", we have shown that in presence of an additional cross - kerr coupling the system becomes unstable at a considerably lower driving power , which leads to significant enhancement of steady - state optomechanical entanglement near the stability threshold .",
    "we have further shown that with increasing cross - kerr coupling , this bipartite entanglement becomes more robust against the variation of system parameters and thermal phonon fluctuation .",
    "these results make our proposed scheme a promising way to improve optomechanical entanglement in the steady - state regime .",
