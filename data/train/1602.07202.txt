    "high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) is a highly nonlinear optical phenomenon @xcite of increasing interest because it can provide coherent xuv and soft x - ray radiation with attosecond ( @xmath1 s ) durations .",
    "this property offers the opportunity to investigate unexplored research areas in atoms and molecules with unprecedented time resolution @xcite .",
    "the hhg optical spectrum has a distinctive shape : a rapid decrease of the intensity for the low - order harmonics consistent with perturbation theory , followed by a broad plateau region where the harmonic intensity remains almost constant , and then an abrupt cutoff , beyond which almost no harmonics are observed .",
    "the hhg process can be understood by means of semi - classical pictures , such as the celebrated three - step model  @xcite : ( i ) an electron escapes from the nuclei through tunnel ionization associated with the strong laser field , ( ii ) it is accelerated away by the laser field until the sign of the field changes , ( iii ) whereupon the electron is reaccelerated back to the nucleus , where it may emit a photon as it recombines to the ground state .",
    "a key quantity emerging from the model is the maximum energy the field can provide to the electron , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ionization potential and @xmath4 is the ponderomotive energy @xcite .",
    "hhg has been studied for many years with theoretical methods solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation using a real - space representation of the wave function  @xcite .",
    "these grid - based methods are taken as the numerical reference for this kind of calculations .",
    "indeed , these approaches have proven to be accurate enough to explain key features of atomic and molecular hhg spectra .",
    "however , grid calculations imply memory and cpu requirements that rapidly become prohibitive with increasing numbers of electrons .",
    "because of this limitation , multielectron systems are handled in practice via the use of effective potentials keeping a single - active electron .    by contrast",
    ", quantum - chemistry methods such as time - dependent configuration interaction ( tdci )  @xcite , multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree - fock  @xcite , or time - dependent density - functional theory  @xcite using local basis functions can more easily handle multielectron systems such as molecules , including the treatment of electron correlation .",
    "the main problem of these methods lies in the difficulty to accurately represent the continuum part of the system eigenstate spectrum . addressing this issue can be done on one - electron systems , such as the h atom , since only one electron is promoted into the continuum during the hhg process .    in this context , the tdci method with a gaussian - type orbital ( gto ) basis set and a heuristic lifetime model @xcite was recently applied to the calculation of the dipole form of the hhg spectrum for the h atom @xcite .",
    "the role of the rydberg and the continuum states was discussed in detail , and reasonable hhg spectra ( plateau / cutoff ) have been obtained , when compared with the prediction from the three - step model  @xcite and grid - based calculations @xcite .",
    "however , the background region , beyond the harmonic cutoff , was higher than expected and spurious harmonics were present .",
    "a possible reason of this behavior is that the basis sets adopted in ref .",
    "describe rydberg states better than the continuum ones .",
    "indeed , while gto basis sets have been successfully applied for calculations of bound - state electronic properties ( even for non - linear optical properties such as second - order hyperpolarizabilities , see e.g. ref . ) , the inherent local nature of gto functions makes it difficult to properly describe continuum states extending over large distances ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . in refs .   and",
    ", standard gto basis sets have been augmented with a large number of diffuse basis functions and/or basis functions centered away from the nucleus in order to cover the large spatial extension of the time - dependent wave function . however , this strategy has the serious drawback of only increasing the number of rydberg states while the number of continuum states is not substantially changed .",

    "the acceleration power spectrum , rather than the dipole power spectrum , was chosen here because the grid calculation is easier to converge for the acceleration power spectrum . for the intensity @xmath14910@xmath92 w/@xmath93 and for the two wavelengths ,",
    "the spectra obtained with the gaussian basis set and the original lifetime model ( with @xmath150 bohr ) are in good agreement with the ones from the grid calculations . in particular",
    ", the cutoff appears at almost the same energy .",
    "however , for the larger intensities , the intensity of the higher harmonics in the plateau obtained with the gaussian basis set decrease too rapidly . this can be attributed to a limitation of the original lifetime model which assigns too large lifetimes to high - energy continuum states .",
    "for this reason we introduce a modified version of the lifetime model , with two different values of the parameter @xmath85 : a large value , @xmath101 bohr , for continuum states with positive energies below the energy cutoff of the three - step model @xmath141 , and a small value , @xmath102 bohr , for continuum states with energies above @xmath141 .",
    "the ionization rates @xmath83 are thus smaller than in the original model for low - lying continuum states , and larger for high - lying continuum states .",
    "this choice allows us to get a more accurate description of the harmonics in the plateau and close to the cutoff .",
    "the values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 have been chosen comparing with the corresponding grid hhg spectra . not surprisingly , the value of @xmath87 is of the order of magnitude of the electron excursion distance @xmath99 ( see table [ tab : lasers ] ) .",
    "we test our modified lifetime model by calculating the ionization probability ( for both the grid and gaussian - basis - set calculations ) @xmath151 where the sum runs over all the bound states .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] reports @xmath152 obtained with the original and the modified lifetime models and from the grid calculations for the three laser intensities .",
    "the original lifetime model leads to largely overestimated ionization probabilities in comparison to the results obtained from the grid calculations .",
    "our modified lifetime model reduces the ionization probability and is in better agreement with the grid calculations , especially for the intensities @xmath147 w/@xmath93 and @xmath148 w/@xmath93 .    coming back to figure  [ fig8 ]",
    ", it is seen that the combined use of the 6-aug - cc - pvtz+8k basis set and of the modified lifetime model results in a hhg spectrum that is in good agreement with the one obtained with the grid calculation at wavelength @xmath95 nm and the intensity @xmath123 w/@xmath93 .",
    "the general shape of the spectrum and the position of the harmonic cutoff are well reproduced with the gaussian basis set , the only remaining differences being larger peaks and a larger background after the cutoff in comparison to the grid results .",
    "for the same wavelength and the largest intensity @xmath15310@xmath94 w/@xmath93 , the agreement is also fairly good even though the position of the harmonic cutoff predicted with the gaussian basis set is slightly too low .    the longer laser wavelength @xmath100 nm represents a more stringent test for our method since higher - energy regions are probed ( see table [ tab : lasers ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the hhg spectra obtained with the gaussian basis set and from the grid calculations is still pretty good for the intensity @xmath14910@xmath92 w/@xmath93 , while the position of the cutoff is slightly underestimated for the intensity @xmath123 w/@xmath93 and significantly underestimated for the largest intensity @xmath154 w/@xmath93 .",
    "this likely comes from a too poor description of the continuum states above 1 hartree with the 6-aug - cc - pvtz+8k basis set , which can be populated for these wavelengths and intensities . a larger number of continuum gaussian functions is needed in order to improve the high - energy part of the hhg spectrum for the largest intensities .",
    "we note , however , that increasing the number of continuum gaussian functions can lead to near - linear dependencies in the basis set ( seen with the presence of very small eigenvalues of the overlap matrix of the basis functions ) and thus numerical instability issues in self - consistent - field calculations .",
    "in this work , we have explored the calculation of the velocity hhg spectrum of the h atom extracted from the dipole , velocity , and acceleration power spectra with gaussian basis sets for different laser intensities and wavelengths . while all the three power spectra give reasonable velocity hhg spectra with similar harmonic peaks before the cutoff",
    ", they tend to differ in the background region beyond the cutoff .",
    "the hhg spectrum extracted from the dipole power spectrum is the most sensitive to the basis set . with the 6-aug - cc - pvtz basis set",
    "it leads to a high background which blurs out the location of the plateau cutoff .",
    "increasing the cardinal number of the basis set ( from @xmath155 to @xmath156 ) or the number of diffuse basis functions ( from @xmath107 to @xmath108 ) does not improve the hhg spectrum .",
    "by contrast , adding 5 or 8 gaussian continuum functions , as proposed by kaufmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , leads to an improvement of the velocity hhg spectrum extracted from the dipole power spectrum at least for laser intensities up to @xmath157 w/@xmath93 by decreasing the background , which thus allows one to better identify the cutoff region .",
    "the combined use of gaussian continuum functions and a heuristic lifetime model with two parameters for modeling ionization results is in a fairly good agreement with the reference hhg spectra from grid calculations , in terms of the general shape of the spectrum , the number and intensity of peaks , and the position of the cutoff .",
    "the agreement is less satisfactory for the largest intensities because the high - energy continuum states are poorly reproduced by the gaussian basis set calculations .",
    "improving the accuracy for the largest intensities would require a larger number of gaussian continuum functions .",
    "gaussian continuum functions thus appear as a promising way of constructing gaussian basis sets for studying electron dynamics in strong laser fields , allowing one to define a balanced basis set to properly describe both bound and continuum eigenstates .",
