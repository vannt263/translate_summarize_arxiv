    "the nature and origin of an accelerating expansion of the universe is the basic problem of modern cosmology .",
    "the most natural explanation of the acceleration of the universe seems to be the cosmological constant parameter interpreted as vacuum energy .",
    "although such an explanation is simple it brings a conundrum that the values of the cosmological constant required by quantum theory ( @xmath4 gev@xmath5 ) and obtained from type ia supernovae observations ( @xmath6 gev@xmath7 ) differ about 100 orders of magnitude @xcite . this problem",
    "is called the cosmological problem .",
    "one approach toward the solving this problem is to consider the cosmological model with the time varying cosmological constant @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the cosmological time .",
    "the parametrization for decaying vacuum is usually taken by hand to the cosmological model @xcite .",
    "our idea is to derive the parametrization of decaying vacuum energy directly from the first principle , namely from the quantum mechanics , then to construct the cosmological model and to test it statistically using astronomical data",
    ". therefore our approach to decaying vacuum cosmology is not purely phenomenological and is motivated by the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics .",
    "decaying false vacuum states from the point of view of the quantum theory of unstable states evolve in time . from basic principles of quantum theory",
    "it is known that the amplitude @xmath8 , and thus the decay law @xmath9 of the unstable state @xmath10 , are completely determined by the density of the energy distribution function @xmath11 for the system in this state : @xmath12\\,d { e}$ ] , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 . from this last condition and from the paley ",
    "wiener theorem it follows that there must be @xmath16 $ ] , for @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the decay law @xmath20 of unstable states decaying in the vacuum can not be described by an exponential function of time @xmath0 if time @xmath0 is suitably long , @xmath21 , and that for these lengths of time @xmath20 tends to zero as @xmath21 more slowly than any exponential function of @xmath0 .",
    "it appears that these deviations from the exponential decay law at long times affect the energy of the unstable state and its decay rate at this time region and thus they affect the energy of the unstable false vacuum states at these times .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that at transition times @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes time when contributions of the exponential part of the survival probability and of its late time non  exponential part are equal , the instantaneous energy of the false vacuum states fluctuates and at late times , much latter then transition times , @xmath24 , it tends to the energy of the true vacuum state as @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the asymptotically late time behavior of the energy of the system in the false vacuum state is given by the following relation @xmath27 this means that in the case of such false vacuum states the cosmological constant becomes time depending .",
    "the standard relation is @xmath28 .",
    "so the fluctuations of @xmath29 at the transition times region and the asymptotically late behaviour of @xmath30 at @xmath24 mean that identical behaviour of @xmath31 have to be observed at these times .",
    "there are two possible scenarios . in the cosmological terminology",
    "if the universe is in a false vacuum state then the cosmological constant is time - dependent in the following way @xmath32    in the model with decaying dark energy and matter , as in most cosmological models , we act on assumptions that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at the large scale ( the cosmological principle ) , the structure and evolution of the universe is governed by the einstein theory of relativity , and the source of gravity is described by energy - momentum tensor for matter and decaying vacuum .",
    "it is also assumed for simplicity that the universe is flat .",
    "then cosmological evolution is determined by the scale factor @xmath33 as a function of the universal cosmological time @xmath0 , which satisfies the friedmann equation @xmath34 where matter density fulfils the conservation condition @xmath35 this condition for the flat homogeneous and isotropic universe has the form @xmath36    in the case of the @xmath31cdm model ( @xmath37 ) it would be useful to rewrite ( [ eq:1 ] ) to the new form after substitution @xmath38 @xmath39    in cosmology we use instead of density of fluids dimensionless parameters called density parameters @xmath40 where @xmath41 is energy density of the fluid @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the hubble function @xmath44 and the index @xmath45 denotes the present epoch .    therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) assumes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "then we obtain the solution in the form @xmath49 after dividing both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) by @xmath50 , we obtain the relation @xmath51 this relation can be rewritten in the terms of redshift @xmath52 as @xmath53 @xmath54 today ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) density parameters satisfy the constraint relation @xmath57 . this relation is fundamental for cosmography which analyzes the observational effects of photons propagation along the zero geodesics .    for the model with vacuum",
    "decaying @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the age of the universe up to the redshift @xmath52 .    for estimation of the model parameters we assume that @xmath60 which gives @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a hubble scale .",
    "then @xmath63 the acceleration equation has the form @xmath64 after changing the variable @xmath65 we obtain the acceleration equation in the form @xmath66 or @xmath67    the first integral of eq .",

    "for the estimation of parameters of the model ( [ eq : model ] ) we used the observations of snia data , bao , cmb , measurements of @xmath3 , alcock - paczyski test .",
    "first , we consider the snia data .",

    "the bao ( baryon acoustic oscillation ) data were taken from the sloan digital sky survey release 7 ( sdss r7 ) dataset which consists of 893 319 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the likelihood function is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the sound horizon at the drag epoch and @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "planck observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation were also used @xcite .",
    "with addition information on lensing from the planck and low-@xmath89 polarization from the wmap ( wp ) , we obtain the combined likelihood function in the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the covariance matrix with the errors , @xmath92 is a vector of the acoustic scale @xmath93 , the shift parameter @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the recombination redshift .",
    "the alcock - paczynski test is the comparison of the radial and tangential size of an object , which is isotropic in the correct choice of model @xcite .",
    "the likelihood function is independent on the @xmath43 parameter and has the following form @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are observational data @xcite .    at the end",
    "it is also valuable to add the constraints on the hubble parameter , i.e. @xmath101 . data of @xmath3 for samples of different galaxies were also used @xcite @xmath102    the final likelihood function for the observational hubble function is @xmath103",
    "to estimate the model parameters we use our own code cosmodarkbox implementing the metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite and using the pade approximants @xcite for the calculation of the likelihood function @xcite .",
    "we use observation data of 580 supernovae of type ia , selected subsets of the data points of hubble function , the measurements of bao from sdss+2dsgrs .",
