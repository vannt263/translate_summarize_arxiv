    "two proofs of this result are given .",
    "the first one is longer , but uses only elementary combinatorics and considerations from the scratch .",

    "indeed , otherwise all these permutations are equal .",
    "but @xmath108 and @xmath109 - a contradiction .",
    "in @xcite we investigate the relation of modular forms to the minkowski question mark function , introducing the notion of _ mean - modular forms_. in particular , the analytic continuation of a certain bivariate analytic function @xmath110 ( an extension of the stieltjes transform of the minkowski question mark function ) requires us to know the analytic formula for @xmath97 as a bivariate function ; whence the principal motivation for the current paper .",
    "in fact , the result of theorem is new , but it is an exercise for people in the field . the much more ambitious program of integrating the world of minkowski question mark function and the world of modular forms for @xmath0 justifies the current paper as a necessary appendix to @xcite . + as just mentioned , this particular question is new , though many intricately related problems were investigated and solved before , and the topic itself is of big importance in the theory of groups ( growth and cogrowth rates ) , graphs ( return and first - return paths ) , and non - commutative probability . + as a particular example of his more general results , kuksov @xcite considers the cogrowth rate of the product @xmath111 , which is the same modular group",
    ". the question of investigating cogrowth rates amounts to the following .",
    "count the number of _ reduced _ words in the alphabet @xmath112 that are equal to the unity .",
    "_ reduced _ means that @xmath30 and @xmath113 , and also @xmath29 and @xmath114 never follow immediately one after another .",
    "it is obvious then that the total number of reduced words of length @xmath24 is @xmath115 : the first letter can be anything , after that the choice is restricted .",
    "the generating function of this sequence ( cogrowth series ) turns out to be @xmath116 the cogrowth rate ( the inverse of the radius of convergence of the taylor series for this function at the origin ) turns out to be @xmath117 .",
    "the function @xmath118 is quadratic algebraic function , as opposed to cubic algebraic function @xmath96 in our case .",
    "the taylor coefficients of @xmath118 are @xmath119 for example , there are @xmath57 reduced words of length @xmath49 : @xmath120 also , proposition [ prop1 ] does not have an analogoue in this case . + in a related direction , quenell in @xcite investigates the _ return generating function _ of cayley graphs for the free products of finite groups .",
    "this is related to the thesis of mclaughlin @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in particular , in case of the modular group the return generating function counts words in @xmath121 of total length @xmath24 that are equal to the unity ( words are not necessarily reduced ) .",
    "the total number of all words of spell length @xmath24 is @xmath122 . in this context",
    ", the function @xmath96 can be interpreted as a return generated function for a _ directed _ cayley graph for @xmath111 , where each @xmath123cycle and @xmath124cycle has a particular direction chosen in advance ; see figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "this technique is implemented as a package and it is part of the library of fricas .",

    "this gives @xmath236 and consequently @xmath237 and indeed , minding the values given by ( [ seka ] ) , maple confirms that the first disrepancy occurs only for @xmath238 .",
    "namely , @xmath239 , and the five missing words are precisely those given by example [ ex2 ] in the sets @xmath225 through @xmath226 . for @xmath240",

    "this polynomial has the unique root @xmath243 of the smallest absolute value , it is real and positive : @xmath244 , @xmath245 .",
    "so , this single observation gives the lower bound @xmath246 for a certain @xmath247 .",
    "in fact , our main theorem implies that for the function @xmath8 we have the sharper bound @xmath248 where @xmath249 , @xmath250 being the smallest ( in absolute value ) root of @xmath251 , the factor of the discriminant of the cubic polynomial in the theorem .    to prove the formula for @xmath22 , and hence for @xmath222",
    ", we need to express @xmath252 and @xmath219 in terms of @xmath22 . in order to accomplish this ,",
    "we introduce the notion of a _ primitive _",
    "@xmath253-_word_. this , by definition , is the word which belongs to the subset which defines the function @xmath228 ( an @xmath254__word _ _ ) , but which can not be written as @xmath255 where each @xmath256 is an @xmath254word .",
    "+ thus , let us continue our classification given by @xmath257 through @xmath258 , and introduce    * @xmath259  number of primitive @xmath253-words , which have @xmath24 copies of @xmath29 and @xmath92 copies of @xmath30 .    in the example [ ex2 ] above",
    ", six of the @xmath254words are primitive , only @xmath260 is not .",

    "this claim follows by induction .",
    "now we are left to count , which gives the above formula . here",
    "@xmath262 stands for a number of ways the number @xmath263 can be written as a sum of @xmath264 positive integers .",

    "so , @xmath271 is a third degree algebraic function over @xmath98 , and thus so is @xmath274 .",
    "the exact form of the cubic equation can be easily calculated with maple , but we rather concentrate on @xmath96 , since , first , the equation for @xmath274 with the help of method in section [ sec - alt ] can be easily calculated by hand , and second , the cubic equation for @xmath271 is very convenient to calculate fast the taylor coefficients of @xmath275 recurrently .",
    "let @xmath276 then the equation for @xmath277 reads as @xmath278 we are left to verify the cubic equation given in the formulation of the theorem .",
    "plugging known values into ( [ tarpp ] ) and using proposition [ prop2 ] , we obtain @xmath279 now , plug this value of @xmath96 into the cubic equation given by the theorem . then factor the numerator .",
    "maple confirms that one of the two multipliers is indeed @xmath280 , so the equation for @xmath96 is verified .",
    "in fact , this equation was discovered by robert israel by finding a @xmath10rd degree algabraic function whose first @xmath281 taylor coefficients coincide with @xmath8 , @xmath282 .",

    "+ the equalities ( [ z ] ) and ( [ t ] ) give a polynomial - time method to calculate coefficients @xmath8 .",

    "+ to obtain the explicit formulae , we can explicitly construct a pda accepting the language , then follow standard methods to obtain generating functions from the pda .",
    "+ the language is very simple : a word equals @xmath45 if some sequence of applications of the rules @xmath293 , @xmath294 to factors of the input word reduces it to the empty word .",
    "this can be done using a pda which has just one state , and a pushdown stack which uses the alphabet @xmath295 where @xmath44 is the bottom - of - stack marker , @xmath45 means a single @xmath29 , @xmath17 means @xmath296 , and @xmath10 means @xmath30 . so that the model of a pda can be used that accepts on empty stack .",
    "let us introduce a symbol @xmath297 , and consider the language @xmath298 .",
    "+ here are the transitions :      this is indeed self - explanatory .",
    "for example , take the item @xmath308 .",
    "this means @xmath29 is the next letter , and @xmath10 is on the top of the stack ( that is , @xmath30 ) .",
    "since @xmath309 does not reduce , replace @xmath10 with @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hande , consider the item @xmath310 .",
    "it stands for a move that now we get a factor @xmath311 , which is removed .",
    "+ the idea is that one reads a word in @xmath23 and puts it into _ normal form _ on the fly , reducing @xmath312 , @xmath156 whenever they appear as one moves right .",
    "the normal form of the prefix of the input word is written ( in code ) on the stack .",
    "accept if at the end the stack is empty ( the normal form is @xmath45 ) .",
    "+ now we follow @xcite to convert the deterministic pda into an unambiguous context free grammar .",
    "let @xmath313 stand for the nonterminal @xmath314 ( since there exists only one state ) .",
    "start symbol is @xmath315 .",
    "we get      next , following the method of chomsky - schtzenberger we obtain the following system of equations for the generating function directly from the grammar : @xmath325 that is , we replace @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath326 and @xmath327 , respectively , and add the corresponding terms . if @xmath328 is the solution , then @xmath329 .",
    "note that the variable @xmath330 appears only in the extression for @xmath331 only as a linear factor @xmath330 .",
    "+ solving easily by hand the last three equations of ( [ sys - in ] ) gives the cubic equation for @xmath332 : @xmath333 plugging everything into the first equation of ( [ sys - in ] ) , we get @xmath334 let @xmath335 , @xmath336 and @xmath337 be three distinct roots of ( [ cub ] ) , and let @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 be the standard symmetric polynomials .",
