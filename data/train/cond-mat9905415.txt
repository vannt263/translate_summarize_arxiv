    "the calculation of the drude weight for exactly solvable models was recently extended to the finite temperature case by fujimoto and kawakami.@xcite if the drude weight is non - zero at finite temperatures , the system shows a ballistic transport rather than a diffusive one .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to discuss the exact drude weight of the 1d quantum @xmath0 sigma model at finite temperatures based upon the bethe ansatz method .",

    "the low temperature limit of eq.([tba2 ] ) gives @xmath56 and @xmath57 . from eqs.([dis1 ] ) and ( [ dis2 ] ) , we have @xmath58 moreover using eqs.([fsc1 ] ) and ( [ fsc2 ] ) , we can show that at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath59 substituting these expressions into eq.([drude ] ) , we obtain the drude weight in the low temperature limit , @xmath60 thus the drude weight is non - zero at finite temperatures .",
    "this result implies that the spin transport of the 1d quantum @xmath0 non - linear sigma model in the low temperature region is ballistic , and that the spin diffusion does not exist .",
    "here we consider the drude weight in the high temperature limit .",
    "although in the sufficiently high temperature region , the non - linear sigma model is not related to the @xmath61 heisenberg spin chain , it is interesting to check that the spin diffusion does not occur in the non - linear sigma model even in the high temperature limit .",
    "we invoke the standard method for the high temperature expansion of the bethe ansatz solution developed by takahashi.@xcite for this purpose , it is convenient to rewrite eqs.([dis1 ] ) , ( [ dis2 ] ) , ( [ tba1 ] ) and ( [ tba2 ] ) into the following form .",

    "the results are @xmath81 furthermore in the high temperature limit , we have the following relations , @xmath82 then substituting these equations into eq.([drude ] ) , we have the drude weight , @xmath83 with @xmath84 note that @xmath45 in the high temperature limit has the same temperature dependence as that of the 1d hubbard model . since even in the high temperature limit , the drude weight is non - zero , it is expected to be non - vanishing in the whole temperature region .",
    "therefore the spin diffusion does not exist in the 1d quantum @xmath0 non - linear sigma model .",
    "this is the main conclusion of this section .",
    "in the previous section , we have calculated the drude weight at finite temperatures which is a probe for transport properties . however in order to discuss the spin diffusion , it is desirable to study spin - spin correlation functions directly .",
    "this issue is not tractable in terms of the bethe ansatz method .",
    "moreover , there is a criticism by buragohain and sachdev against the approach exploited in the previous section.@xcite they claimed that the calculation of the drude weight from the finite size spectrum may not give the correct thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures .",
    "thus , in this section , we will discuss spin - spin correlation functions with the use of the @xmath1 expansion method for the quantum 1d @xmath2 sigma model,@xcite and check the consistency with the results obtained by the bethe ansatz method in sec.ii .",
    "the @xmath1-expansion is utilized by several authors in the study of haldane gap systems.@xcite although the @xmath2 sigma model with large @xmath6 is not related to the haldane gap systems , the qualitative properties of the excitation are similar to those of the @xmath0 sigma model . it is expected that the results obtained for the @xmath2 sigma model with large @xmath6 may give a qualitative understanding of the @xmath0 sigma model .    we are mainly concerned with the spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath85 , which is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the retarded spin correlation function , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is a structure factor .",
    "it is known that in haldane gap systems , the main contribution to @xmath85 comes from the uniform part of spin - spin correlation functions for @xmath90.@xcite it is given by the correlation function of the uniform magnetization vector @xmath16 .",
    "that is , @xmath91\\rangle e^{{\\rm i}(\\omega t+qx)}. \\label{spinc}\\ ] ] for sufficiently large @xmath6 , the excitation in the @xmath2 sigma model is massive @xmath6-plet bosons interacting weakly with each other via a coupling constant of order @xmath92.@xcite thus we can calculate the correlation function by the perturbative expansion in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "the green s function of the free massive @xmath6-plet bosons @xmath93 is given by , @xmath94 where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "one of the important effects of the interaction is the quasiparticle damping which is given by the imaginary part of the self - energy .",
    "the lowest order self - energy correction of which the diagram is shown in fig.1 , is easily evaluated as @xmath97 ( @xmath98 , a constant ) for small @xmath99 and @xmath100.@xcite if this damping effect is sufficiently large , it leads to the diffusive form of the correlator for the @xmath101 field , @xmath102 naively thinking , it seems that this correlation function gives rise to a diffusive behavior of @xmath85 .",
    "however this expectation is not correct .",
    "@xmath103 is the conserved current of the non - linear sigma model which satisfies the continuity equation @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "therefore a ward - tkahashi identity holds for these current operators .",
    "the ward - takahashi identity ensures the cancellation of the self - energy corrections with vertex corrections of the correlation functions , which leads to a ballistic behavior of spin - spin correlation functions . in order to show this , we introduce the three point vertex functions defined as , @xmath106 where @xmath107 etc . in the momentum - energy space ,",
    "the current operators are expressed as @xmath108 using the commutation relations @xmath109=",

    "we will take an analytic continuation @xmath113 at the last stage .",
    "since we are concerned with the contribution from small @xmath15 and @xmath99 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 in @xmath116 can be replaced with @xmath117 and @xmath14 . as a result , we have @xmath118 . using this relation and the ward - takahashi identity ( [ wti ] ) , we can obtain the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath119 .",
    "\\label{chi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to the lowest order in @xmath1 , we expand @xmath120 in eq.([chi1 ] ) .",
    "then , putting @xmath121 , we find that in the limit of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the above expression reduces to , @xmath124   \\bigl[\\frac{1}{\\omega+\\frac{v^2p}{e_p}q+{\\rm i}\\delta } -\\frac{1}{\\omega-\\frac{v^2p}{e_p}q+{\\rm i}\\delta}\\bigr ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\mbox{regular terms}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus it has a non - diffusive pole at @xmath125 which can not be removed by finite temperature effects .",
    "this pole gives a logarithmic singularity @xmath126 of @xmath85 which signifies the ballistic spin transport .",
    "the result is basically equivalent to that obtained for the free boson model by jolicoeur and golinelli.@xcite this ballistic behavior is due to the cancellation between the damping effect and the vertex corrections .",
    "although we have demonstrated the cancellation only up to the lowest order in @xmath1 , we expect that the cancellation holds in all orders . in this model",
    "the forward scattering is the dominant low - energy process .",
    "thus the quasiparticle damping does not give rise a diffusive behavior , if one takes into account the vertex corrections which preserve the current conservation law .",
    "the above result is consistent with the bethe ansatz solution obtained in sec .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the spin diffusion is absent in the 1d quantum non - linear sigma model itself .",
    "in this section , we will discuss about the origin of spin diffusion observed experimentally in the haldane gap system , @xmath3 .",
    "the important feature observed in this experiment is that there exists the cutoff frequency @xmath127 which depends on temperatures like @xmath128 with @xmath129 a constant.@xcite at @xmath130 , the spin diffusion is observed .",
    "one possible mechanism of the spin diffusion may be a coupling with some other degrees of freedom , such as phonons , as discussed by narozhny for the @xmath4 heisenberg spin chain.@xcite here we will investigate this possibility . in order to treat the interaction between spin and phonon , we invoke the @xmath1-expansion for the @xmath2 sigma model .",
    "we add the following term to the hamiltonian which represents the spin - phonon interaction , @xmath131 where @xmath132(@xmath133(x ) ) is an annihilation(creation ) operator for phonons , and @xmath134 is a coupling constant . for the case of @xmath135 ,",
    "this term comes from the continuum limit of the spin - phonon interaction defined on lattices , @xmath136 we expect that the analysis for the @xmath2 sigma model gives a qualitative understanding for the effect of this term . for @xmath137",
    ", we can treat the spin - phonon interaction eq.([phonon ] ) perturbatively .",
    "the diagram for the lowest order self - energy correction is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we can easily evaluate this diagram using the green s functions for massive magnons ( [ magnon ] ) and free phonons given by , @xmath138 where @xmath98 is the velocity of phonons .",
    "then the imaginary part of the retarded self - energy reads , @xmath139 for small @xmath99 . here",
    "then , if @xmath141 holds , the retarded green s function of massive @xmath6-plet @xmath93 has a diffusive pole , @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",
    "in contrast to the case without phonons discussed in sec .",
    "iii , this damping effect does not cancel with vertex corrections of the spin - spin correlation function , eq.([spinc ] ) , since the spin current operator is not conserved . neglecting vertex corrections and using the diffusive propagator ( [ diff ] ) ,",
    "we evaluate the rpa type diagrams for the spin correlation function ( [ spinc ] ) .",
    "the result is given by , @xmath144 for small @xmath15 and @xmath99 .",
    "here @xmath145 , @xmath127 , and @xmath146 have the same temperature - dependence as @xmath147 .",
    "thus we have a diffusive behavior of the spin - spin correlation function .",
    "the fourier transformation of eq.([spindiff ] ) with respect to @xmath99 leads to , @xmath148\\vert t\\vert}.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath127 gives a cutoff frequency .",
    "for @xmath130 the diffusive behavior appears .",
    "the important point is that @xmath127 depends on temperatures , @xmath149 , if we neglect the temperature dependence of the mass gap @xmath150 .",
    "these results seem to give a qualitatively satisfying explanation for the spin diffusion and the temperature - dependent cutoff observed in @xmath3 .",
    "note that the presence of the temperature - dependent cutoff frequency is quite due to the mass gap of the spin excitations .",
    "the above argument is applicable only if the damping effect eq.([damp ] ) is large enough to give rise to a diffusive pole . in this case",
    ", the perturbative approach may break down , and the corrections due to higher order processes are not negligible , though it is expected that the propagator has a diffusive form , eq.([diff ] ) , for small momentum and energy .",
    "thus it may be difficult to fit our result to the experimental data precisely .",
    "however tuning the parameters , @xmath151 , @xmath98 , @xmath134 properly , we obtain the temperature dependence of @xmath127 which is qualitatively consistent with the experimental results .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the spin transport of the 1d quantum non - linear sigma model is ballistic even at finite temperatures , and that the spin diffusion does not exist .",
    "we have also argued a possible mechanism for the spin diffusion observed experimentally in the haldane gap system @xmath3 .",
    "it has been shown that the coupling with phonons accounts for the experimental results qualitatively .",
    "our study is based upon the non - linear sigma model which is believed to be a low - energy effective theory for haldane gap systems .",
    "we can not answer the question whether the spin diffusion intrinsically exists or not in the @xmath61 heisenberg spin chain model . according to de alcantara bonfim and reiter",
    ", the 1d classical heisenberg spin model does not show the spin diffusion even in the high temperature limit.@xcite the result for the classical spin system may be independent of whether the spin @xmath5 is an integer or a half - integer , and generally quantum effects may suppress the thermal spin diffusion .",
    "thus it is unlikely that the spin diffusion appears in the @xmath61 quantum heisenberg spin chain itself .",
    "we speculate that the spin diffusion observed in @xmath3 may be due to a coupling with some other degrees of freedom",
