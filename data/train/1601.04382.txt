    "in this paper we study the root distribution of a sequence of polynomials satisfying one of the following three - term recurrences : @xmath10 with certain initial conditions and @xmath11 polynomials in @xmath8 with complex coefficients . for the study of the root distribution of other sequences of polynomials that satisfy three - term recurrences , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , we choose the initial conditions so that the generating function is @xmath12 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 .",
    "we notice that the root distribution of @xmath0 will be the same if we replace @xmath13 in the numerator by any monomial @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath14 is not a monomial , the root distribution will be different .",
    "the quadratic case @xmath3 is not difficult and it is also mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we present this case in section 2 because it gives some directions to our main cases , the cubic and quartic denominators @xmath2 , in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "our approach uses the concept of @xmath9-analogue of the discriminant ( @xmath9-discriminant ) introduced by ismail @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-discriminant of a polynomial @xmath15 of degree @xmath16 and leading coefficient @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the roots of @xmath15 .",
    "this @xmath9-discriminant is @xmath21 if and only if a quotient of roots @xmath22 equals @xmath9 . as @xmath23 , this @xmath9-discriminant becomes the ordinary discriminant which is denoted by @xmath24 . for the study of resultants and ordinary discriminants and their various formulas , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we will see that the concept of @xmath9-discriminant is useful in proving connections between the root distribution of a sequence of polynomials @xmath0 and the discriminant of the denominator of its generating function @xmath25 .",
    "we will show in the three cases mentioned above that the roots of @xmath0 lie on a portion of a real algebraic curve ( see theorem [ quadratic ] , theorem [ cubic ] , and theorem [ quartic ] ) .",
    "for the study of sequences of polynomials whose roots approach fixed curves , see @xcite .",
    "other studies of the limits of zeros of polynomials satisfying a linear homogeneous recursion whose coefficients are polynomials in @xmath8 are given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-discriminant will appear as the quotient @xmath9 of roots in @xmath26 of @xmath2 .",
    "one advantage of looking at the quotients of roots is that , at least in the three cases above , although the roots of @xmath0 lie on a curve depending on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the quotients of roots @xmath27 of @xmath2 lie on a fixed curve independent of these two polynomials .",
    "we will show that this independent curve is the unit circle in the quadratic case and two peculiar curves ( see figures 1 and 2 in sections 3 and 4 ) in the cubic and quartic cases . from computer experiments ,",
    "this curve looks more complicated in the quintic case @xmath28 ( see figure 3 in section 4 ) .    as an application of these theorems",

    "interestingly , the critical values @xmath21 and @xmath33 are roots of the double discriminant @xmath34",
    "in this section , we will consider the root distribution of @xmath0 when the denominator of the generating function is @xmath3 .",

    "in this case @xmath40 belongs to @xmath37 , and we only need to consider the case @xmath47 . by partial fractions , we have @xmath48 thus if we let @xmath49 then @xmath9 is an @xmath50-st root of unity and @xmath51 . by the definition of @xmath9-discriminant in , @xmath9 is a root of @xmath52 which equals @xmath53 this implies that @xmath54 thus @xmath55 since @xmath9 is an @xmath50-th root of unity .",

    "3 .   if @xmath68 , the roots of @xmath0 lie on two parts of the circle @xmath65 restricted by @xmath69 .    indeed , by complex expansion , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71    theorem [ quadratic ] yields three cases : @xmath72 , @xmath73 or @xmath74 . since @xmath75 , all these cases give @xmath76 .",
    "we note that if @xmath73 then the condition @xmath77 reduces to @xmath78 suppose @xmath62 .",
    "then the condition @xmath76 implies that the roots of @xmath0 are real .",

    "the roots of @xmath0 lie either on the half circle @xmath73 , @xmath66 ( from the inequality ) , or on the real interval given by @xmath67 ( from the inequality ) . if @xmath68 then the roots of @xmath0 lie on the two parts of the circle @xmath73 restricted by @xmath69 ( from the inequality ) .",
    "we notice that in this example , the inequality @xmath77 gives the endpoints of the curves where the roots of @xmath0 lie .",
    "thus , these endpoints are roots of @xmath80 . moreover the critical values of @xmath32 , which are @xmath21 and @xmath33 , are roots of the double discriminant of the denominator @xmath81 this comes from the fact that the endpoints of the fixed curves containing the roots of @xmath0 are the roots of @xmath82 .",
    "when this discriminant has a double root as a polynomial in @xmath8 , some two endpoints of the fixed curves coincide .",
    "that explains the change in the shape of the root distribution .",
    "in this section we show that in the cubic case @xmath4 , the roots of @xmath0 lie on a portion of a real algebraic curve . as we see in the proof of theorem [ quadratic ]",
    ", we can first consider the distribution of the quotients of roots @xmath83 of @xmath2 , and then we can relate to the root distribution of @xmath0 using the @xmath9-discriminant .",

    "our goal is to show that the number of roots @xmath104 on @xmath89 is at least @xmath103 , counting multiplicities .",
