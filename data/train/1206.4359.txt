    "human mobility in form of migration or commuting becomes increasingly important nowadays due to many obvious reasons @xcite : ( i ) traveling becomes easier , quicker and more affordable ; ( ii ) some borders ( like the ones inside eu ) are more transparent or even inexistent for travelers ; ( iii ) the density and growth of the population and their gross national product presents large territorial inequalities , which naturally induces mobility ; ( iv ) the main and successful employers concentrate their location in narrow geographic regions where living costs are high , hence even in developed countries the employees are forced to commute ; ( v ) large cities grow with higher rates , optimizing their functional efficiency and creating the necessary intellectual and economic surplus for sustaining this growth @xcite",
    ". this higher growth rate of the population can be achieved only by relocating the highly skilled work - force from smaller cities .",
    "here we propose a unified continuum approach to explain the resulting mobility patterns .",
    "+ understanding and modeling the general patterns of human mobility is a long - standing problem in sociology and human geography with obvious impact on business and the economy @xcite .",
    "research in this area got new perspectives , arousing the interest of physicists @xcite due to the availability of several accurate and large scale electronic data , which helps track the mobility fluxes @xcite and check the hypotheses and results of different models .",
    "traditionally mobility fluxes were described by models originating from physics .",
    "the best - known is the _ gravity model _ @xcite that postulates fluxes in analogy with the newton s law of gravitation , where the number of commuters between two locations is proportional to their populations ( i.e. the ` demographic mass ' ) and decays with the square of the distance between them . beside the well - known gravity model , several other models were used like the generalized potential model @xcite , the intervening opportunities model @xcite or the random utility model @xcite . recently , a parameter - free _ radiation model _ has been proposed , leading to mobility patterns in good agreement with the empirical observations @xcite .",
    "the model was developed assuming a spatially discretized settlement structure , and consequently it operates with a discretized flux topology on the edges of a complete graph .",
    "here we consider and test a continuum approach to this model operating with fluxes between any two regions , and show that several other mobility models can be derived within the same framework .",
    "this novel approach based on the continuum description offers a new modeling and data interpretation paradigm for understanding human mobility patterns .",
    "the radiation model @xcite has been originally formulated to estimate commuting fluxes , i.e. the average number of commuters traveling per unit time between any two locations in a country .",
    "the key idea is that while the home - to - work trip is a daily process , it is determined by a one - time choice , i.e. the job selection . therefore commuting fluxes reflect the human behavior in the choice of the employment . in real life",
    "many variables can affect the employment s choice , from personal aspirations to economic considerations , but for the sake of simplicity only the most influential variables are considered in the model : the salary a job pays ( or more generally , the working conditions ) , and the distance between the job and home .",
    "the main idea behind the model is that an individual accepts the closest job with better pay : _ each individual travels to the nearest location where she / he can improve her / his current working conditions ( benefits)_. with this assumption , the probability @xmath0 that an individual with benefit @xmath1 refuses the closest @xmath2 offers is : @xmath3 where @xmath2 is the number of open positions in the area within a circle of radius @xmath4 centered in the origin location , and @xmath5 is the cumulative distribution function of the benefits . equation  ( [ pc ] ) is equivalent with assuming that the rejection of @xmath2 job offers with benefits less or equal to @xmath1 are independent events . + making different assumptions and approximations on the benefit distribution @xmath6 , one can obtain several formulas for the number of trips between locations .",
    "below we present four examples : the _ original radiation model _ , the classic _ intervening opportunities _",

    "consider the situation in which the benefit distribution is singular , i.e. all jobs are exactly equivalent @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the heaviside function ) . in this case",
    "we have to specify the individual s behavior when s / he receives a job offer identical to her / his current one : this corresponds to setting a specific value to the step function at the discontinuity point , @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 , then the individual will travel to an infinite distance ; while if @xmath14 , the individual accepts the job in the closest location . if @xmath15 , then the individual accepts each offer with probability @xmath16 and refuses it with probability @xmath17 .",

    "this equation is especially important because data are usually collected as fluxes in a discretized space , whose regions are defined according to the local administrative subdivision ( e.g. counties or municipalities ) .",

    "note that @xmath90 is the same probability of one trip derived in the original radiation model s discrete formulation @xcite with the only difference being that here we have @xmath92 instead of @xmath89 ( @xmath2 is equal to @xmath93 ) .",
    "+ it is important to observe that the equations derived for @xmath50 are correctly normalized when the total number of job offers , @xmath94 , is infinite and therefore finite - size corrections are required in real - world applications @xcite .",

    "the correction to @xmath50 is of the order @xmath97 , which in most cases is very small given that usually @xmath98 .",
    "this normalization scheme has a straightforward mechanistic interpretation : it offers another try at job selection for individuals who during their first job search did not find any job offer with better benefit than their current one .",
    "other kinds of normalization procedures that combine two of the models presented above are also possible .",
    "if , for example , we assume that the individuals who did not find a better job in their first try decide to select the offer with the highest benefit , even if it does not exceed their current one , ( a mechanism corresponding to the random selection model ) the normalized probability we obtain is @xmath99 . therefore , there are multiple ways to normalize the models , each capturing a different selection mechanism .",
    "this suggests that a systematic investigation of finite size effects could also help understand the mechanisms underlying job selection .      in fig .",

    "materials and methods_. + an advantage of the proposed approach is that it is defined for a continuous spatial density of job offers , and its results are thus independent of any particular space subdivision in discrete locations .",
    "this feature solves some consistency issues present in other mobility models defined on a discretized space .",
    "consider for example the gravity law @xcite , the prevailing framework to predict population movement @xcite , cargo shipping volume @xcite , inter - city phone calls @xcite , as well as bilateral trade flows between nations @xcite .",
    "the gravity law s probability of one trip from an area with population @xmath89 to an area with population @xmath84 ( assuming that population is proportional to the number of job offers ) at distance @xmath58 is obtained by fitting a formula like @xmath101 to previous mobility data .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the values of the best - fit parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 are strongly dependent on the spatial subdivision considered , raising the problem of deciding which subdivision gives the correct results .",
    "+ also , the continuous formalism developed here helps finding a solution to the issue concerning the additivity of the fluxes frequently encountered in discrete formulations . as an example , consider two adjacent areas , @xmath104 and @xmath105 with populations @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively , at the same distance @xmath58 from the origin location .",
    "the gravity law predicts @xmath108 and @xmath109 travelers to @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "if we consider a different spatial subdivision , in which locations 1 and 2 are now grouped together forming a single location , @xmath110 , and we calculate the number of travelers we obtain @xmath111 unless @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "if the exponent @xmath103 is different from one , the additivity requirement does not hold and the difference in the estimated trips can be considerably high .",
    "for example , if @xmath114 and @xmath115 , then @xmath116 , i.e. a @xmath117 relative difference .",
    "the additivity of the fluxes is a necessary property required to any mobility model in order to be self - consistent .",
    "we can easily verify that all models derivable from eq .",
    "( [ pc ] ) have the additivity property .",
    "this is a consequence of the linearity of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) .",
    "in fact , for every two regions @xmath118 and @xmath119 we have @xmath120= \\langle t_{\\mathbf{x_0}}(1 ) \\rangle + \\langle t_{\\mathbf{x_0}}(2 ) \\rangle$ ] , for a generic @xmath68 .",
    "we observe that it is possible to develop a continuum formalism for the gravity model that fulfils the additivity constraint by assuming that the probability to travel from location @xmath59 to location @xmath121 is @xmath122 .",
    "the average number of travelers from region @xmath123 to region @xmath71 is @xmath124 and because of the linearity of the integral on @xmath71 the fluxes are additive .",
    "+ we can use the continuum approach to investigate the relationship between a region s population and the total number of travelers from that region outwards ( i.e. the commuters whose destination is outside the region ) .",
    "it is often assumed that the number of commuters is proportional to the region s population .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the commuting fluxes measured by the us census 2000 @xcite .",
    "we can check the validity of this assumption by writing the average number of commuters leaving a region @xmath123 as @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the complement of @xmath123 , and @xmath127 is the probability for an individual in @xmath59 to travel outside @xmath123 ( cf .",

    "when @xmath130 becomes larger than a characteristic size only the individuals living close to the boundary have a non - zero chance of travelling outside @xmath123 .",
    "+ a further generalization of the model could take into account the fact that euclidean distance is not appropriate in situations where geographical barriers exist and/or travel facilities are heterogeneously distributed . in this case one introduces a metric tensor @xmath145 and the square distance between neighboring positions at point @xmath121 is @xmath146 with @xmath147 and @xmath148 . in this case eq .",
    "( [ pxx ] ) is rewritten as @xmath149 ^ 2}\\sqrt{g(\\mathbf{x})}\\mathrm{d}x_1\\mathrm{d}x_2 $ ] , where @xmath150 is a local parameter of the model .",
    "the fundamental eq .  ( [ pc ] ) represents a unified framework to model mobility and transportation patterns .",
    "in particular , we showed how the intervening opportunity model @xcite can be regarded as a degenerate case of the radiation model , corresponding to a situation in which the benefit differences are not taken into account in the employment s choice .",
    "we also explained the advantages of a continuous approach to model mobility fluxes , we derived the appropriate discretized expressions that guarantee the consistency of our predictions on any discrete spatial subdivision , verifying that the fluxes additivity requirement holds .",
    "+ furthermore , our approach also provides an insight on the theoretical foundation of the most common types of gravity models . indeed ,",
    "when the space is homogeneous and the job s distribution is fractal , @xmath151 is independent of the point of origin , i.e. @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the fractal dimension and an average density of job offers , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ pd2 ] ) for the probability , @xmath155 , to observe a trip to a generic region @xmath71 within distances @xmath75 and @xmath76 from the origin becomes ( @xmath156 is the number of job offers in d ) @xmath157 \\frac{n}{\\rho r_2^{d_f } - \\rho r_1^{d_f}}$ ] . in particular , for the original radiation model , eq .",
    "( [ pc1final ] ) , the average number of trips to a region @xmath71 containing @xmath84 job offers is @xmath158 , whereas for the intervening opportunities model , eq .",
    "( [ pc3final ] ) , @xmath159 .",
    "these two classes of deterrence functions @xmath160 , power law and exponential , are actually the two most used form of gravity models @xcite . moreover ,",
    "our approach provides an interpretation to the gravity model s fitting parameters .",
    "first , the exponents @xmath102 and @xmath103 are both one when the benefits are spatially uncorrelated , i.e. the benefit distributions at the local ( regional ) and global ( country ) scales are the same . if @xmath102 or @xmath103 differ from one it means that there are regions where job offerings with higher or lower benefits tend to concentrate .",
    "second , the exponent of the power law is predicted to be two times the fractal dimension of the job offers , @xmath153 , whereas the exponential deterrence function should be substituted with a stretched exponential with shape parameter @xmath153 and a characteristic length of the order of @xmath161 .",
    "thus , when the spatial displacement of the potential trip s destinations is a fractal , the radiation model s formalism offers a theoretical derivation of the gravity models from first principles .",
    "+ in conclusion , we have developed a general framework for unifying the theoretical foundation of a broad class of human mobility models .",
    "the used continuum approach allows for a consistent description of mobility fluxes between any delimited regions . the successful comparison with real mobility fluxes extracted from two different data sources confirms that our approach not only provides a theoretically sound modeling framework , but also a good quantitative agreement with experimental data .",
    "this suggests that the decision process we assumed for the job selection also captures the basic decision mechanism related to the choice of the destinations for other activities ( shopping , leisure , ... ) . on the other hand",
    ", our study suggests that the weighted network representing the mobility fluxes among geographic regions can be the result of a stochastic process consisting of many independent events .",
    "this approach is somehow complementary to the theory of optimal transportation networks @xcite that describes the patterns observed in different natural and artificial systems solely as the adaptation to a global optimization principle ( e.g. leaf venations , river networks , power grids , road and airport networks ) .",
    "the modeling framework we propose provides also a plausible example of spontaneous bottom - up design of transportation networks .",
    "indeed , we show how complex patterns can arise even in those systems lacking a global control on the network topology , or a long - term evolutionary selection mechanism of the optimal structure .",

    "<S> human mobility is investigated using a continuum approach that allows to calculate the probability to observe a trip to any arbitrary region , and the fluxes between any two regions . the considered description offers a general and unified framework , in which previously proposed mobility models like the gravity model , the intervening opportunities model , and the recently introduced radiation model are naturally resulting as special cases . </S>",
    "<S> a new form of radiation model is derived and its validity is investigated using observational data offered by commuting trips obtained from the united states census data set , and the mobility fluxes extracted from mobile phone data collected in a western european country . </S>",
    "<S> the new modeling paradigm offered by this description suggests that the complex topological features observed in large mobility and transportation networks may be the result of a simple stochastic process taking place on an inhomogeneous landscape . </S>"
