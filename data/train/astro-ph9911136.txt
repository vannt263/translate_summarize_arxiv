    "the processes of the compton scattering , electron - positron pair annihilation and production play an important role in the functioning of highly energetic astrophysical sources such as pulsars , supernovae , @xmath0-ray bursts and the early universe ( wolfgang , fabian & giovannelli 1990 ; rose 1973 ) .",
    "the cross sections of these processes are used , almost always , either in the classical thomson limit or at best including the klein - nishina corrections for high energy photons .",
    "to the best of my knowledge , the effect of the plasma medium on the cross sections has not been investigated . in this paper ,",
    "i show that the cross sections change significantly when the presence of the plasma medium is taken into account .",
    "the plasma medium affects in two ways .",
    "first the square of the four momentum of a photon is no longer zero , it is equal to the square of the plasma frequency , and second the electron - photon vertex now depends upon the dielectric constant @xmath1 of the plasma medium .",
    "the cross sections become functions of the plasma density n.    the dispersion relation of photons in an unmagnetized plasma is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the photon frequency , @xmath4 is the photon wavevector and the plasma frequency @xmath5 in an electron - proton plasma and @xmath6 in an electron - positron plasma of density n. thus the square @xmath7 of the photon four momentum @xmath8 is found to be @xmath9 ( krishan 1999 ) . the total energy associated with a wave in a dielectric ( harris 1975 ; landau & lifshitz 1960 ) , is modified by the von laue factor @xmath10 so that the vector potential @xmath11 is defined as :    @xmath12_{\\omega_{k } } } \\right]^{1/2 }   \\lambda_{\\vec k \\sigma } \\left[a_{\\vec k \\sigma } e^{i k.x }   + a^+_{\\vec k\\sigma }   e^{-i k.x } \\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 s are the photon creation and annihilation operators . for an unmagnetized plasma , the dielectric function @xmath14 .",
    "the vector potential @xmath15 is modified only to the extent that the photon dispersion relation in vacuum is replaced by the photon dispersion relation in a plasma . with these changes",
    ", one can proceed to calculate the cross sections for the three processes related by the crossing symmetry using the standard techniques of the quantum electrodynamics ( reinhardt 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the compton scattering consists of the absorption of an incoming photon with four - momentum k and polarization vector @xmath16 by an electron with the emission of a second photon with four - momentum @xmath17 and polarization vector @xmath18 .",
    "the feynman diagrams for this process are shown in figure ( 1 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the four - momenta of the initial and the final electrons respectively .",
    "the differential cross section for the compton scattering averaged over photon polarizations is found to be : @xmath21\\right ] g\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the initial and the final photon energies related by the energy - momentum conservation law ,    @xmath24    and @xmath25^{-1}\\sqrt{1-p^\\prime}\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is the scattering angle , @xmath27 @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 one can easily identify the thomson , the klein - nishina and the additional terms which depend upon the plasma frequency . unlike in vacuum , the initial and the final photon frequencies are related through a quadratic expression . for every incoming photon , there are two possible scattered photons .",
    "the two values of the ratio @xmath30 are plotted against the scattering angle @xmath26 for various values of p and @xmath0 in figures ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . the first root ( for plus sign )",
    "corresponds to an increase of the frequency of the scattered photon as the plasma density or the parameter @xmath31 increases for @xmath32 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the variations with @xmath31 are very small .",
    "the second root also increases with @xmath31 but lies below the @xmath34 line for small values of scattering angle @xmath26 .",
    "further the quadratic ( 3 ) has real roots only for a limited range of scattering angle for a given value of @xmath31 .",
    "the variation of the two differential cross sections corresponding to the two roots ( equation 2 ) with @xmath26 for different values of the parameter @xmath31 and initial photon energy @xmath0 is shown in figures ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "the cross section corresponding to the first root is found to decrease significantly with an increase in @xmath31 for @xmath35 and increase for @xmath36 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the cross section begins to increase for @xmath37 .",
    "further the scattering takes place only for limited values of the scattering angle .",
    "the cross section for the second root ( figure 5 ) shows a similar behaviour but becomes very very large for large scattering angles .",
    "this root may not represent the physical situation .",
    "the annihilation of an electron with four - momentum @xmath38 and spin @xmath39 and a positron with four - momentum @xmath40 and spin @xmath41 into two photons with four - momenta and polarizations @xmath42 and @xmath43 is depicted by the feynman diagrams in figure ( 6 ) .",
    "the similarity with the compton scattering is obvious . by using the crossing symmetry ( reinhardt 1992 , 1994 )",
    "i.e. by replacing @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in the compton scattering matrix , one can obtain the matrix elements for the pair annihilation process . by appropriately taking care of the phase space factors and averaging over the initial and summing over the final states",
    ", we find the differential cross section for pair annihilation in the rest frame of the electron to be : @xmath46\\sqrt{1-p_1 } } { 2 \\beta _",
    "+ \\{1 + \\gamma_+ - ( 1 - p_1)^{-1/2 } \\beta_+ \\cos \\theta\\ } \\{1 + \\gamma_+ -(1-p_1)^{1/2 } \\beta_+ \\cos \\theta\\}}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the positron energy , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the energies of the two photons , @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54    the variation of the differential cross section for pair annihilation with @xmath26 , the angle between the positron beam and the photon ( @xmath55 , for different values of the positron energy @xmath56 , plasma density parameter @xmath57 is shown in figures 7 and 8 .",
    "integrating over the solid angle @xmath58 the total cross section @xmath59 for pair annihilation can be determined .",
    "the variation of @xmath59 with @xmath56 for different values of @xmath60 is shown in figure ( 9 ) .",
    "it is seen that the cross section for pair annihilation increases with an increase in the plasma density .",
    "the creation of an electron and a positron by the annihilation of two photons is depicted in figure ( 10 ) . again using crossing symmetry wherein one replaces @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the compton scattering matrix , the total cross section for the process of pair production can be determined .",
    "more directly , it is known that the total cross section @xmath63 for pair production is related to @xmath64 ( reinhardt 1992 , 1994 ) as : @xmath65 .",
    "the variation of @xmath63 with @xmath56 for different values of @xmath57 is shown in figure ( 11 ) .",
    "one can see the threshold behaviour of the pair production cross section as well as its increase with an increase of the plasma density .",
    "the enhancement of the pair annihilation and production cross sections and the decrement of the compton scattering cross section ( for small @xmath26 ) in a plasma are the consequences of the finite mass that a photon acquires in a plasma",
    ". typical plasma densities at which the effects are appreciable are of the order of @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "such a density , for example , exists in the early universe when its temperature was @xmath68 .",
    "the highly anisotropic nature of compton scattering with reduced cross sections for forward scattering in a plasma will have important consequences in several astrophysical situations .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` the author gratefully acknowledge discussions with ` + ` dr . r. t. gangadhara , dr .",
