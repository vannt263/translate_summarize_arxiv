    "the casimir effect@xcite is a particular type of vacuum polarization which arises in quantization volumes restricted by material boundaries and in spaces with non - euclidean topology due to distortions in the spectrum of zero - point oscillations of relativistic quantized fields in comparison with the case of free infinite euclidean space - time . in case of volumes restricted by material boundaries , the polarization energy results in the casimir force acting on these boundaries . in spaces with non - euclidean topology",

    "because of this , most of experiments were performed using the configuration of a sphere above a plate .",
    "the configuration of a cylinder above a plate also presents some advantages if to compare with the case of two parallel plates .",
    "unfortunately , over many years it was not possible to obtain exact expressions for the casimir force in these configurations .",
    "for this reason , the approximative proximity - force theorem@xcite ( pft ) was used to compare experiment with theory . according to the pft , at short separations ( @xmath4 ) the casimir forces between an ideal metal cylinder ( per unit length ) or a sphere and a plate",

    "it was supposed that a scalar field satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions . as was noticed in ref .  , the casimir energies for the dirichlet scalar should not be taken as an estimate for those in electromagnetic case .",
    "in addition , it should be stressed that the errors of the pft calculated in ref .",
    "are related to the casimir energy and not to the experimentally measured casimir force .",
    "this makes all errors larger . to illustrate , if we were considering the error of the pft in application to the electromagnetic casimir energy between a plate and a cylinder [ instead of the force considered in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ] , the value of @xmath12 would be obtained as a negative error of the pft.@xcite the magnitude of the latter is by a factor of 1.6667 larger than the error obtained above for a force .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) confirms that pft works well at short separations and reproduces the exact result with a very high precision .",
    "this justifies the use of the pft for the interpretation of experimental data . in refs .",

    "this result of refs .",
    "is in contradiction with a more fundamental path - integral theory formulated for ideal metals.@xcite it is easily seen , that the quantity @xmath14 , plotted in the above - mensioned figures as a function of @xmath20 at different @xmath2 and with a fixed @xmath21 , is , in fact , a function of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , for corrugated plates with rescaled @xmath23 m and @xmath24 m ( but with the same @xmath22 ) the deviation of the lateral force amplitude from the pft value is still 16% . at @xmath24 m , however , the nonideality of a metal does not play any important role , and ref .   demonstrates the complete agreement between the exact result and the pft if ( as it holds in our case ) @xmath2 is several times less than @xmath16 .",

    "stresses that the amplitudes considered are not small comparing to @xmath2 ( for instance , @xmath30 ) and another assumption @xmath31 used in refs .",
    "is also violated ( for instance , @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is not surprising , then , that refs .",
    "arrive at a force amplitude of 0.20pn so far away from the value of 0.33pn obtained theoretically using the complete pft and that of @xmath33pn measured experimentally at 95% confidence in ref .  .",
    "thus , the approach used in refs .",
    "is not only in contradiction with a more fundamental path - integral theory@xcite but is also excluded by experiment.@xcite this justifies the conclusion of refs .",
    "that the pft presents correct description of the lateral casimir force between corrugated test bodies when the separation is several times less than the corrugation period .",
    "the most important experiments on the casimir force after the xth marcel grossmann meeting were performed at purdue university  indiana state university@xcite@xmath0@xcite and at the university of california , riverside.@xcite@xmath0@xcite two experiments in refs .",

    "the two test bodies of the micromechanical oscillator are a sphere and a plane plate .",
    "sphere is oscillating with the angular resonant frequency , and the shift of this frequency under the influence of the casimir force @xmath34 acting between a sphere and a plate was measured as a function of separation @xmath2 in the region from 160 to 750 nm . from this shift",
    "one can find@xcite@xmath0@xcite the force gradient @xmath35 and using the pft arrive to the equivalent casimir pressure @xmath36 this experiment is characterized by a very low total experimental error which was determined at a 95% confidence level and varies between 0.55 and 0.60% in a wide separation region from 170 to 350 nm .",
    "the obtained experimental results were compared with different theoretical approaches using the lifshitz theory@xcite and tabulated optical data for the complex index of refraction.@xcite in this comparison all corrections due to surface roughness , nonzero temperature , sample - to - sample variations of optical data , errors of the pft , effects of spatial nonlocality and of patch potentials were carefully analyzed and taken into account in a conservative way .",
    "specifically , the error of the pft was conservatively estimated as equal to @xmath7 , whereas recent results presented in sec .",
    "2 lead to several times smaller error .",
    "it was concluded that data are consistent with the surface impedance approach to the thermal casimir force at the laboratory temperature @xmath37k ( see fig .  1 , left , where the differences between theoretical , @xmath38 , and experimental , @xmath39 , casimir pressures are plotted versus separation ) .",
    "the data were found to be consistent also with the theoretical approach using the plasma model at @xmath37k , and with the theoretical computations at zero temperature . at the same time ,",

    ", shows that experimental data exclude theoretical casimir pressures , @xmath40 , computed using the drude model approach at @xmath37k ( discussion of different theoretical approaches is contained in sec .  4 ) .",
    "the experiment by using a micromechanical torsional oscillator has permitted also to obtain stronger constraints on non - newtonian gravity which are considered in sec .",
    "three experiments in refs .",
    " are devoted to the measurement of the casimir force acting between au - coated sphere and single - crystal si plates with different charge carrier densities using an atomic force microscope . in ref .",
    "b - doped si plate with a resistivity @xmath41 cm and concentration of charge carriers @xmath42 was used .",
    "the measured force - distance relation of the casimir force was compared with two theoretical dependences .",
    "one of them was computed for this sample and another one for a sample made of si with high resistivity equal to @xmath43 cm .",
    "it was found that theoretical results computed for the semiconductor plate used in experiment are consistent with the data . at the same time , theoretical results computed for high - resistivity si are experimentally excluded at 70% confidence .",
    "this suggests that the casimir force is sensitive to the conductivity properties of semiconductors .",
    "the obtained results were confirmed in the direct measurement of the difference casimir force acting between au - coated sphere and two p - doped si plates of different charge carrier densities.@xcite one of the silicon plates ( sample @xmath44 ) had the resistivity @xmath45 cm and the concentration of charge carriers @xmath46 .",
    "another one ( sample @xmath47 ) had much lower resistivity @xmath48 cm and much higher concentration of charge carriers @xmath49 . in fig .  2 , taken from ref .  , the difference of experimental mean casimir forces , acting between au - coated sphere and samples @xmath47 and @xmath44 , @xmath50 , versus separation is shown as dots .",

    "nm the mean difference in the measured casimir forces exceeds the experimental error of force difference .",
    "this permits a conclusion that in ref .",
    "the influence of charge carrier density of a semiconductor on the casimir force was experimentally measured for the first time .",
    "the third experiment on the measurement of the casimir force between au - coated sphere and single - crystal si plate demonstrates a new physical phenomenon , the modulation of the casimir force with laser light.@xcite in the absence of light the used si plate had a relatively high resistivity @xmath51 cm and relatively low concentration of charge carriers @xmath52 .",
    "this plate was illuminated with 514 nm pulses , obtained from an ar laser . in the presence of pulse",
    "the concentration of charge carriers increases up to @xmath53 .",
    "the difference of the casimir forces in the presence and in the absence of pulse , @xmath54 , was measured using an atomic force microscope within the separation range from 100 to 500 nm .",

    ", the solid line is in excellent agreement with the experimental data , whereas the dashed line is in disagreement with data .",
    "physical consequences following from this observation are discussed in the next section .",
    "the demonstrated dependence of the casimir force between a metal and a semiconductor on the density of charge carriers in semiconductor can be applied in nanodevices of the next generations such as micromirrors , nanotweezers and nanoscale actuators . in so doing ,",
    "the density of charge carriers can be changed either by doping and/or due to irradiation of a device by laser light leading to respective variations in the magnitude of the casimir force .    since the xth marcel grossmann meeting in 2003 , some other experiments on the casimir force have been proposed .",
    "one could mention the proposal to measure the influence of the casimir energy on the value of the critical magnetic field in superconductor phase transitions , @xcite the suggestion to measure the casimir torques using the repulsive force due to liquid layers,@xcite and the proposed casimir force measurements at large separations.@xcite@xmath0@xcite special attention was attracted to new techniques for the measurement of the casimir force .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "the holographic interferometer was first applied for optical detection of mechanical deformation of a macroscopic object induced by the casimir force .",
    "all this demonstrates that there are considerable opportunities in the experimental investigation of the casimir force and in applications of the casimir effect .",
    "during all the period between the xth and xith marcel grossmann meetings the problem of the thermal casimir force was hotly debated . until 2005 , only the case of two plates made of real metal was the subject of controversy . in 2005",

    "is described by using the approximation of dielectric permittivity @xmath3 depending only on the frequency , and the continuity conditions @xmath63 for the electric field , magnetic induction and electric displacement on boundary planes .",
    "thus , the lifshitz theory does not take into account the effects of spatial dispersion . in this model case",
    "the reflection coefficients take the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the central point of the debates is the term of eq .",

    "we underline that the violation of energy conservation in the so - called `` dielectric approximation '' of nonlocal electrodynamics used in refs .",
    "has long been rigorously proved@xcite and discussed in the literature.@xcite    to conclude , presently there is no question that the approach to the thermal casimir force using the drude model is thermodynamically invalid . at the same time , the plasma model and impedance approaches are consistent with thermodynamics . in particular , they satisfy the nernst heat theorem.@xcite in refs .",
    " it was shown that the same problems , as for metals , arise for dielectrics if one describes their conductivity at zero frequency with the help of the drude model .",
    "this problem is more detailly discussed in another contribution to these proceedings.@xcite    important problem is the comparison of different theoretical approaches to the thermal casimir force with experiment . as was already emphasized in sec .  3 , the computations at zero temperature , and also theoretical approaches using the plasma model and the leontovich surface impedance at @xmath37k , are consistent with experiment ( see , for example , fig .  1 ,",
    "left ) . at the same time , the theoretical approach using the drude model is excluded by experiment at 95% confidence level within the separation region from 170 to 700 nm . in the separation region from 300 to 500 nm the drude model approach is excluded by experiment at even higher 99% confidence level.@xcite . for the purposes of comparison between experiment and theory ,",
    "the computations of the casimir pressure were done by using the tabulated optical data for the complex index of refraction@xcite extended to lower frequencies .",
    "in fact , a marked difference between approaches arises only when calculating the contribution of the zero - frequency term in the lifshitz formula which should be found theoretically because at very low frequencies optical data are not available .    the comparison between experiment and theory in fig .",
    "1 is quite transparent .",
    "however , in refs .",
    "several objections against it were raised . according to ref .",
    ", purdue group@xcite claims `` the extraordinary high precision to be able to see our effect at distance as small as 100 nm '' and `` the accuracy is claimed to be better than 1% at separations down to less than 100 nm '' .",
    "these statements are misleading because the experimental ranges in refs .   and are from 260 to 1100 nm and from 160 to 750 nm , respectively .",
    "there are no statements concerning the separations of 100 nm and below 100 nm in refs .  .",
    "according to another claim in refs .  ,",
    "the determination of the absolute sphere - plate separation with the absolute error @xmath104 nm , as stated in ref .",
    ", is difficult because `` the roughness of the surfaces is much larger than the precision stated in the determination of the separation '' .",
    "this claim is not right because the separations are measured between zero levels of the surface roughness .",
    "these zero levels are uniquely determined for any value of the roughness amplitude .",
    "one more claim@xcite is that `` the effects of surface plasmons@xcite have not been included '' .",
    "this claim is wrong because the computations in refs .",
    "were performed using the lifshitz formula which includes in full the effects of surface plasmons .    as was noticed recently,@xcite",
    "the precise values of the drude parameters are important for an accurate calculation of the casimir force in experimental configurations . according to ref .  ,",
    "the use of different drude parameters measured and calculated for different au samples may lead to up to 5% variations in the magnitude of the casimir force . in the computations of refs .   the values @xmath105ev and @xmath106ev were used which are based on the experimental data of ref .   and computations of ref .  .",
    "as was demonstrated above , these values lead to a very good agreement with traditional approaches to the thermal casimir force which predict only small thermal corrections at short separations and exclude the drude model approach . if much smaller value for au plasma frequency were used in computations ( i.e. , @xmath107ev or 7.50ev as suggested in ref .  )",
    "the agreement between the traditional theoretical approaches and experimental data would be worse for a few percent .",
    "the same holds for many other experiments on the casimir effect.@xcite@xmath0@xcite it should be particularly emphasized that with smaller values of @xmath75 the disagreement between the experimental data and the drude model approach to the thermal casimir force becomes much larger than is demonstrated in fig .  1 ( right ) .",
    "if one uses widely accepted criteria from the statistical theory of the verification of alternative hypotheses,@xcite the hypothesis on much smaller magnitude of @xmath75 ( than that used in refs .  ",
    ") is rejected at high confidence by all already performed experiments on the casimir force with au surfaces .",
    "this conclusion was recently confirmed@xcite by the determination of the plasma frequency of au coatings in the experimental configurations of refs .   using the measured temperature dependence of the films resistivity .",
    "the obtained result @xmath108ev [ and a respective value for @xmath109ev ] is in excellent agreement with refs .  .",
    "it leads to even better than in fig",
    ".  1 agreement of data with the traditional approaches to the thermal casimir force and excludes the drude model approach at the impressive 99.9% confidence level within a wide separation range .",
    "thus , to date , it is beyond question that the drude model approach is experimentally excluded .",
    "one more important physical phenomenon which sheds light on the problem of the thermal casimir force is the modulation of the casimir force with laser light discussed in sec .",
    "3 . from fig .  3",
    "it follows that the experimental data are consistent with theory if the dc conductivity of high resistivity si in the absence of laser light is discounted . on the contrary , the dashed line takes into account dc conductivity of a si plate in the absence of laser light described using the drude dielectric function . as is seen in fig .  3 ,",
    "the dashed line is experimentally excluded .",
    "thus , for both metals and semiconductors the account of actual dielectric response at very low frequencies leads to contradictions between the lifshitz theory and the experiment . to achieve an agreement between experiment and theory",
    ", one should use the dielectric response in the region of characteristic frequency @xmath110 and extrapolate it to zero frequency .",
    "the complete understanding of this problem goes beyond the scope of the lifshitz theory .",
    "many extensions of the standard model predict a new ( so - called `` fifth '' ) force coexisting with the usual newtonian gravitational force and other conventional interactions .",
    "such force can arise from the exchange of light elementary particles ( e.g. , scalar axions , graviphotons , dilatons , and moduli@xcite ) , and as a consequence of extra - dimensional theories with low energy compactification scales.@xcite the interaction potential of the fifth force acting between two point masses @xmath111 and @xmath112 at a distance @xmath113 is conventionally represented as a yukawa correction to the usual newtonian potential @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the gravitational constant , @xmath116 is a dimensionless constant characterizing the strength of the yukawa force , and @xmath117 is its interaction range .    it has been known@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite that the best constraints on the parameters @xmath118 in submicron range follow from the measurements of the casimir force .",
    "the pressure of a hypothetical interaction , @xmath119 , which may act between experimental test bodies is computed@xcite@xmath0@xcite by the pairwise summation of potentials ( [ eq22 ] ) with a subsequent negative differentiation with respect to separation",
    ". then constraints on the hypothetical yukawa - type pressure are found from the agreement between measurements and theory at 95% confidence level . according to the experimental results in refs .",
    ", no deviations from calculations using the traditional theories of the casimir force were observed .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the hypothetical pressure should be less than or equal to the half - width of the confidence interval @xmath120 , \\label{eq23}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 $ ] is the total absolute error of the quantity @xmath122 .",
    "note that just this error ( and negative this error ) are plotted in fig .  1 ( left and right ) by the solid lines .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the strongest constraints on @xmath116 for different values of @xmath117 following from the measurements of the casimir force and compare them with the best gravitational experiments .",
    "each line in fig .  4",
    "is related to some specific experiment .",
    "the region of ( @xmath123 ) plane above each line is prohibited from the respective experiment and below each line is permitted .",
    "constraints shown by line 1 follow from the most recent measurement of the casimir pressure using a micromechanical torsional oscillator.@xcite line 3 is obtained@xcite from the casimir force measurement between an au - coated sphere and a plate by means of an atomic force microscope.@xcite line 4 follows@xcite from the measurement of the casimir force between an au - coated spherical lens and a plate by means of torsion pendulum.@xcite line 2 presents the constraints obtained from the first isoelectronic differential force measurement@xcite between an au - coated probe and two au - coated films , made out of gold and germanium . in this measurement",
    "the casimir background is experimentally subtracted , thus avoiding the necessity to model the casimir force .",
    "finally , line 5 shows the most strong constraints on yukawa - type deviations from newtonian gravity obtained@xcite from the gravitational experiment using a micromachined silicon cantilever as the force sensor at separations of order @xmath124 m , where the casimir force is already negligibly small .",
    "gravitational experiments provide also the strongest constraints on @xmath116 in the interaction range @xmath125 m ( see refs .   and for more details ) .    as is seen in fig .  4 , at and below a micrometer interaction range there is no competitors to the casimir effect in obtaining constraints on non - newtonian gravity .",
    "during the last few years these constraints were strengthened by up to @xmath126 times basing on the results of different measurements of the casimir force between metal surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , existing limits on @xmath116 below a micrometer are still relatively weak and should be strengthened by several orders of magnitude to reach the theoretically predicted regions of strange and gluon modulus , and of gauged barions .",
    "in the foregoing , we have discussed main achievements in the physics of the casimir effect during the period after the xth marcel grossmann meeting hold in 2003 . in our opinion , the major theoretical breakthrough is the obtaining of the exact analytical solution for the electromagnetic casimir energy in the configuration of an ideal metal cylinder above a plate .",
    "the resolution of this problem opened new opportunities for the investigation of the casimir force between curved boundaries and permitted find first indisputable result on the accuracy of the pft .",
    "the major experimental breakthroughs during this period are the most precise measurements of the casimir pressure between metal surfaces using a micromechanical oscillator ( decca et al . ) and the first experiments on the casimir effect in configuration of metal sphere and semiconductor plate by means of an atomic force microscope ( mohideen et al . ) .",
    "both sets of experiments resulted in far - reaching and important conclusions .",
    "experiments by decca et al .",
    "have conclusively excluded large thermal corrections to the casimir force at short separations as predicted by the drude model approach .",
    "experiments by mohideen et al . demonstrated the possibility to control the casimir force by changing the density of free charge carriers and led to new knowledge on the applicability of the lifshitz theory to dielectrics .",
    "time between xth and xith marcel grossmann meetings was marked by controversial discussions of different approaches to the theoretical description of the thermal casimir force . during these discussions",
    "it was clearly demonstrated that all the proposed approaches are of approximate phenomenological character .",
    "none of them can yet claim to be the final fundamental resolution of the problem . till the end of this period it was conclusively demonstrated that the drude model approach is in contradiction with the foundations of thermodynamics and is excluded experimentally at a 99.9% confidence level .",
    "important theoretical problem for future is the fundamental understanding of the thermal casimir force and related physical phenomena caused by vacuum and thermal oscillations of the electromagnetic field ( e.g. , atomic friction , radiative heat transfer etc . ) .",
    "the experimental challenge for near future is the measurement of the thermal effect in the casimir force which has not been measured yet .",
    "both recent theoretical achievements and the performed experiments confirm the unique potential of the casimir effect both in fundamental physics for constraining predictions of new unification physical theories beyond the standard model and in nanotechnology for fabrication , operation and control of a new generation of microdevices .",
    "this confirms the increasing role of the casimir effect both in modern physics and in technological applications .",

    "<S> we review recent developments in the casimir effect which arises in quantization volumes restricted by material boundaries and in spaces with non - euclidean topology . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of our discussion is the novel exact solution for the electromagnetic casimir force in the configuration of a cylinder above a plate . </S>",
    "<S> the related work for the scalar casimir effect in sphere - plate configuration is also considered , and the application region of the proximity force theorem is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> next we consider new experiments on the measurement of the casimir force between metals and between metal and semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the complicated problem connected with the theory of the thermal casimir force between real metals is analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the present situation regarding different theoretical approaches to the resolution of this problem is summarized . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with new constraints on non - newtonian gravity obtained using the results of latest casimir force measurements and compare them with constraints following from the most recent gravitational experiments . </S>"
