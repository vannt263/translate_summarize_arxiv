    "the central theorems here take the form : ` @xmath0 belongs to the class of abelian @xmath5-groups @xmath6 if and only if @xmath1 belongs to @xmath6 ' . evidently this is reminiscent of a number of well - known and documented statements of the form : `",

    "@xcite has established such an attainment for @xmath5-torsion abelian @xmath3-groups but under the additional condition that they are not separable .",
    "we shall supersede here this claim removing the condition on inseparability , i.e. by proving the attainment for arbitrary @xmath5-primary @xmath3-groups .",
    "we begin now with an assortment of facts ( some of their proofs are quite elementary , but we include them for the sake of completeness of the exposition ) that motivate this work and that are selected in the next paragraph ; all notations and the terminology used are standard and will follow essentially the books of fuchs @xcite or those cited in the bibliography .",
    "nevertheless , for the convenience of readers , we include certain crucial technical terms and notions .",
    "for instance , @xmath9 is the intersection of all subgroups @xmath10 for @xmath11 . under a large subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath0 we mean the fully invariant subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath0 with the property @xmath12 for every basic subgroup @xmath13 of @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", @xmath10 is a large subgroup of @xmath0 for each natural number @xmath14 .",
    "we add some additional background material as well from @xcite and @xcite , necessary for our successful presentation , because of its significance to the theory .",
    "if @xmath1 is an arbitrary large subgroup of a @xmath5-primary group @xmath0 , then @xcite and [ 1 ] independently established the explicit form of a representation for @xmath1 , that is , @xmath15 $ ] , where the sequence @xmath16 is non - decreasing . from this",
    "it follows by folklore technical arguments that @xmath17 , that @xmath18=p^mg[p]$ ] for some @xmath19 and that @xmath20=p^jg[p]+p^tg[p^2]$ ] for some @xmath21 .",
    "however , the given representation of @xmath1 is not enough to determine whether @xmath1 inherits the structural characteristics for @xmath0 and conversely . that is why another approach must be demonstrated .",
    "next , we recall the definition and structural properties ( the proofs are omitted entirely and can be found in @xcite ) of the so - called @xmath22-groups .",

    "finally , again using @xcite , @xmath1 must be an @xmath22-group .",

    "suppose @xmath241 such that both @xmath33 and are direct sums of @xmath5-cyclic groups . then what is the algebraic structure of @xmath22 ?",
    "we know that @xmath22 is fully starred ( by irwin ",
    "richman ) , but however a more precise description is needed .",
    "for example , if @xmath22 is a @xmath5-group and @xmath33 is bounded at @xmath61 , we have known via the nunke s criterion that @xmath22 is @xmath155-projective .      -.5pc the following definition of a pure - complete @xmath5-group is stated in @xcite .",
    "an abelian @xmath5-group @xmath0 is pure - complete if for every @xmath242 $ ] there is a pure subgroup @xmath243 of @xmath0 so that @xmath244 $ ] .",

    "@xmath247 $ ] for some pure subgroup @xmath248 of @xmath0 .",
    "an application of @xcite assures that @xmath249 is large in @xmath248 , whence it is only a routine matter to check that @xmath250 is pure in @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we may write @xmath247\\cap l[p]=(m\\cap l)[p]$ ] , i.e. by definition @xmath1 is pure - complete , as claimed .",
    "the proof is completed . @xmath31",
    "@xmath150    let @xmath0 be an abelian @xmath5-group .",
    "then @xmath0 is pure - complete if and only if @xmath7 is pure - complete for some arbitrary fixed positive integer @xmath14 .",
    "the necessity follows automatically from the previous proposition via the substitution @xmath251 .",
    "after this , the more difficult reverse question is the focus of our examination .",
    "in fact , since @xmath252 , a routine transfinite induction reveals that we may presume @xmath253 .",
    "now , given a subgroup @xmath254 $ ] whence @xmath255 $ ] and @xmath256 $ ] for some pure subgroup @xmath257 of @xmath258 . by referring @xcite",
    ", we infer that there is a pure subgroup @xmath195 of @xmath0 so that @xmath259 and @xmath260=p[p]=(pk)[p]$ ]",
    ". therefore , @xmath261 $ ] .",
    "our future aim , which we pursue , is to check that @xmath244 $ ] for some pure subgroup @xmath243 of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we construct the wanted group @xmath243 as follows : we need to check that @xmath243 is indeed a group .",
    "in fact , it is self - evident that @xmath262 and that if @xmath263 then @xmath264 . next , let @xmath263 and @xmath265 . thus @xmath266 for @xmath267 and as well as @xmath268 for @xmath269 and therefore @xmath270 .",
    "it is trivial that @xmath271 .",
    "further , we distinguish two basic cases .",
    "first , if there is nothing to prove . otherwise , when @xmath272 , we detect that @xmath273 = k[p]$ ] whence @xmath274 .",
    "so , in both situations , @xmath275 , as needed .",
    "besides , because henceforth and thereby @xmath244 $ ] .",
    "finally , we shall verify that @xmath243 is pure in @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , motivated by @xcite , for each natural number @xmath167 we compute this concludes the proof .",
    "if @xmath276 is a pure subgroup of @xmath1 , then does there exist a pure subgroup @xmath277 of @xmath7 for some non - negative integer @xmath14 such that @xmath278=u[p]$ ] .",
    "if the answer is yes , @xmath1 being pure - complete does imply that the same is @xmath7 for this @xmath14 .",
    "here we quote some major problems that remain unsolved : is it true that @xmath0 is a ( 1 ) direct sum of @xmath2-summable @xmath5-groups ; ( 2 ) @xmath155 projective @xmath5-group ; ( 3 ) thick @xmath5-group ; ( 4 ) essentially finitely indecomposable @xmath5-group ; ( 5 ) pure - complete @xmath5-group ; ( 6 ) semi - complete @xmath5-group ; ( 7 ) direct sum of torsion - complete @xmath5-groups ( @xcite , problem 4 ) ; ( 8) fuchs 5 @xmath5-group ; ( 9 ) q-@xmath5-group ; ( 10 ) @xmath279-separable @xmath5-group ; ( 11 ) weakly @xmath279-separable @xmath5-group if and only if so is @xmath1 ?    1 however , not all properties of @xmath0 are inherited for @xmath1 and conversely .",
    "in fact , we give the following example that is our goal here : the abelian @xmath5-group @xmath0 is said to be starred ( see , for instance , @xcite ) if it has the same power as its basic subgroup @xmath13 . set @xmath280 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath0 is unbounded torsion - complete with a basic subgroup @xmath281 of cardinality @xmath279 , and assume that the _ generalized continuum hypothesis _ holds .",
    "then we claim that @xmath0 is starred , and @xmath10 is unbounded torsion - complete ( see , for example , @xcite ) but not starred .",
    "this is fulfilled because @xmath282 is a basic subgroup of @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) and so complying with p.  29 , exercise  7 of @xcite we compute @xmath283 in general .",
    "thus the assumption that @xmath1 is countable does not imply that @xmath0 is countable .",
