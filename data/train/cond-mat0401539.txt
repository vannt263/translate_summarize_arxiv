    "the development of _ ab initio _ dmft scheme requires fast methods and algorithms to solve the anderson impurity model @xcite in general multiorbital case .",
    "present techniques based on either non  crossing approximation ( nca )  or iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) are unable to provide the solution to that problem due to a limited number of regimes where these methods can be applied @xcite .",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique @xcite is very accurate and can cope with multiorbital situation but not with multiplet interactions .",
    "also its applicability so far has been limited either to a small number of orbitals or to unphysically large temperatures due to its computational cost .",
    "recently some progress has been achieved using impurity solvers that improve upon the nca approximation @xcite , but it has not been possible to retrieve fermi liquid behavior at very low temperatures with these methods in the orbitally degenerate case .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility to use interpolation for the self  energy of the quantum impurity model in general multiorbital situation .",
    "we do not attempt to develop an alternative method for solving the impurity problem , but follow the ideology of lda theory where approximations were designed by analytical fits @xcite to the quantum monte carlo simulations for homogeneous electron gas @xcite .",
    "numerically very expensive qmc calculations for the impurity model display smooth self ",
    "energies at imaginary frequencies for a wide range of interactions and dopings , and it is therefore tempting to design such an interpolation . we also keep in mind that for many applications a high precision in reproducing the self  energies may not be required .",
    "one of such applications is , for example , the calculation of the total energy ce , nature , science which , as well known from lda based experience , may not be so sensitive to the details of the one  electron spectra . as a result , we expect that even crude evaluations of the self ",
    "energy shapes on imaginary frequency axis may be sufficient for solving many realistic total energy problems .",
    "another point is a computational efficiency . bringing full self  consistent loops with respect to charge densities @xcite and",
    "other spectral functions require many iterations towards the convergency which may not need too accurate frequency resolutions at every step .",
    "this view should , of course , be contrasted with calculation of properties such as the low  energy spectroscopy and especially transport where delicate distribution of spectral weight at low energy , namely the imaginary part of the analytically continued self  energy , needs to be computed with much greater precision . here , extensions of the interpolative algorithms should be implemented and its beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we can achieve a fast interpolative algortihm for the self  energy utilizing a rational representation .",
    "the coefficients in this interpolation can be found by forcing the self  energy to obey several limits and constrains .",
    "for example , if infinite frequency ( hartree  fock ) limit , high  frequency moments of the self  energy , low  frequency mass renormalization , number of particles as well as the value of the self  energy at zero frequency are known from independent calculation , the set of interpolating coefficients is well defined . in this work ,",

    "we find that the slave  boson approach predicts the parameters of interpolation with a good accuracy while the hubbard i method fails in a number of regimes .",
