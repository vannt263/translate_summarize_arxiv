    "slowly driven by the input of new ideas and concepts , avalanches of papers have in recent years seen the light in the field of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "this activity was certainly justified by the huge conceptual and practical implications of the self - organization mechanisms . from a theoretical point of view",
    "two main questions were soon posed : ( i ) what are the main ingredients able to drive `` spontaneously '' a system to its critical state without need of fine - tuning any control parameter ? , and ( ii ) what are the links between self - organized critical states and standard critical ones appearing in equilibrium and non - equilibrium systems ? . in order to answer the first of the two aforementioned issues ,",
    "several paths to soc have been identified ( a recent review of them , as well as a summary on experiments on soc can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "certainly the most celebrated ones among them are : the presence of two infinitely - separated time scales @xcite , and extremal dynamics @xcite , though these are certainly not the only ones @xcite .",
    "for example , in sandpiles @xcite , the archetype of soc systems , the two infinitely separated time scales correspond to a slow scale at which grains of sand are added to the system , and a fast one for the relaxation of unstable piles which leads to a rapid redistribution of sand , and eventually to boundary dissipation . it has been shown that it is only in the double limit of driving rate , @xmath0 , and dissipation rate , @xmath1 going to @xmath2 with @xmath3 , that scale invariant behavior is generated up to the system - size cut - off @xcite . under the effect of the external drive , the system jumps among stable ( absorbing ) configurations via avalanche - like rearrangements .",
    "some of the sandpiles we will refer to are : the original bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) sandpile @xcite , the manna model @xcite , the zhang model @xcite , the oslo ricepile model @xcite , as well as some variations of them .    despite of some very remarkable rigorous results @xcite and",
    "some renormalization group analyses @xcite , the question of whether the critical properties of sandpiles can be related to more standard critical phase transitions , or more specifically , whether the associated critical ( avalanche ) exponents @xcite can be ascribed to any known universality class , remains open .",
    "a priori , these are not straightforward questions to answer ; in particular , the presence of two time scales makes it difficult to apply standard techniques for the study of scale invariant systems to sandpiles .",
    "another intrinsic difficulty lies in the fact , that exponents controlling the deviation from criticality can not be measured in slowly driven sandpiles , posed by definition at their critical point .",
    "in order to circumvent these difficulties we have studied the the so - called _ fixed energy sandpiles _ ( fes ) @xcite .",
    "these are cellular automata sharing the same microscopic dynamics as their corresponding standard sandpile counterparts but without external driving or dissipation . for each standard sandpile model",
    "we can define its fes version by keeping constant its total energy ( number of sand grains ) . in this way",
    ", the initial energy density @xmath4 becomes a control parameter .",
    "fes are found to be critical only for a particular value @xmath5 ( which as we will show turns out to be identical to the stationary energy density of its driven - dissipative counterpart @xcite ) . for energy densities below @xmath6",
    "the fes - sandpile falls into an _ absorbing state _ @xcite , while for values above that threshold activity is indefinitely sustained , i.e. the fes is in an _ active phase_. consequently , the phase transition in fes can be enviewed as an absorbing state phase transition @xcite ( with an infinite number of absorbing states ) . observe that , switching on dissipation and driving , in the presence of activity @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the absence of activity",
    "there is addition , but no loss of activity , so @xmath9 implies @xmath10 @xcite . evidently , the only possible stationary value for the density in the sandpile is @xmath6 ! not only @xmath6 is common to a critical fes and its slowly - driven counterpart : also higher moments and correlation functions coincide in the large - size limit ( as expected , given that the bulk dynamics is identical in both cases ) .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical analyses of the critical behavior of fes aimed at verifying the previous arguments and at determining a complete set of exponents .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite where the main ideas , simulations , analysis techniques , and results are presented ( some of the obtained critical exponents are included in table 1 ) .",
    "let us remark that other attempts have been made to connect sandpiles with different types of phase transitions , as for instance : pinning - depinning transitions in disordered media @xcite , the voter model @xcite , and branching processes @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to review or discuss them .",
    "generically systems exhibiting a transition into an absorbing state belong in the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) , the field theoretical ( or langevin equation ) representation of which is the celebrated reggeon field theory ( rft ) @xcite .",
    "this universality class has proven very robust with respect to the variation of microscopic details , number of components , and number of absorbing states @xcite . only in the presence of some extra conservation law or additional symmetry ( as , for example , a @xmath11-symmetry between two equivalent absorbing states , which in some cases tantamount to _ parity conservation _",
    "@xcite ) , have the critical exponents been found to differ from those of dp @xcite .",
    "following rather general principles of relevance and symmetry , a set of langevin equations aimed at capturing the critical features of fes was proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that this type of phenomenological approach has proven extremely useful , and provided sound results when applied to other systems with many absorbing states ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this set of equations includes one for the evolution of a coarse - grained activity field , @xmath12 , and one for the energy ( or background ) field , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the activity field represents the local density of unstable sites , while the energy field stands for the total number of grains regardless of the local activity state .",
    "the proposed set of equations is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are constants , and @xmath17 is a gaussian white noise . in a nutshell , these equations express the fact that the transition for the activity is controlled by the same type of terms appearing in the rft , i.e. the most relevant terms in standard absorbing - state phase transitions @xcite , plus an additional coupling between the activity field and a static conserved energy field .",
    "this extra term stems from the fact that creation of activity is locally fostered by the presence of a high density of the background field , and this background field ( energy ) is a conserved one .",
    "the extra conservation law is therefore the new relevant ingredient with respect to rft .",
    "some other terms , consistent with the symmetries and conservation laws , could have been included in eq.([lan ] ) but they all turn out to be irrelevant from a power counting analysis @xcite .",
    "let us also remark that the second equation in eq.([lan ] ) , being linear , can be integrated out , leading to a non - markovian contribution and a quenched disordered linear term in the activity equation ( a detailed analysis and discussion of these terms can be found in @xcite ) . in what follows , we avoid performing such an integration to make explicit the presence of a conservation law , and stress that this extra contribution is relevant at the rft fixed point @xcite .    which sandpiles is this theory intended to describe ?",
    "although in principle we would like to describe the original btw sandpile this seems to be an unrealizable task , the reasons for this being manifold .",
    "the main reason , is that the btw model being deterministic , has many hidden conservation laws and toppling invariants @xcite which are almost impossible to implement in a coarse grained langevin equation ( for which a detailed book - keeping of symmetries and conservation laws is essential ) .",
    "owing to the existence of these conservation laws , the fes version of the btw exhibits strong non - ergodicity as shown and discussed in @xcite ; the stationary state depends strongly upon the initial configuration ( and not only on the initial energy ) . from a different perspective",
    ", it has also been recently shown that btw does not obey simple scaling @xcite .",
    "our approach is therefore intended to reproduce the scaling behavior of stochastic sandpiles with no extra conservation , symmetry , or spatial anisotropy @xcite , as for example : the manna model @xcite , ricepiles @xcite , the stochastic version of the zhang model @xcite , and other modifications of them .",
    "having proposed a set of langevin equations for stochastic sandpiles , it would be an extremely desirable next step to derive specific predictions ( i.e. values of the critical exponents and scaling functions ) , obtained after solving perturbatively the renormalization group associated with eq.([lan ] ) . despite considerable efforts , unfortunately ,",
    "so far we have not been able to complete satisfactorily such a challenging task .",
    "elucidating whether this is just due to technicalities , or has some more profound origin ( concerning the theory renormalizability ) still needs to be sorted out .",
    ".critical exponents for spreading and steady state experiments in @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "models : cttp : conserved threshold transfer process ; crd : conserved reaction - diffusion model ; manna : abelian manna sandpile ; dp : directed percolation ( for the sake of comparison ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     leaving aside for the moment field theoretical analysis of eq.([lan ] ) , we proceed with a slightly more indirect verification of the validity of our theory . inspired by the previous set of equations eq.([lan ] )",
    "two of us have recently made the following conjecture : _ all stochastic models with an infinite number of absorbing states in which the order parameter evolution is coupled to a static conserved field define a unique universality class _ @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been supported by extensive simulations of the following different models fulfilling all the above - listed requirements @xcite :    * \\(i ) a conserved threshold transfer process @xcite ; * \\(ii ) a conserved lattice gas with repulsion of nearest neighbor particles @xcite ; * \\(iii ) a reaction - diffusion model ( crd ) with two species a and b @xcite    ( see @xcite for model definitions and details ) .",
    "all the measured critical exponents both for steady state and for analysis of spreading @xcite coincide within error bars and are also the same as those measured in extensive numerical simulations of the fes manna sandpile @xcite ( up - to - date exponent values in two and three dimensions are listed in table i ; for further simulation details as well as model and exponents definitions see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the slowly - driven versions of the previous models are self - organized @xcite , and the corresponding avalanche exponents are in good agreement with those of stochastic sandpiles @xcite . finally , all the scaling laws among steady - state , spreading and avalanche critical exponents @xcite are satisfied within numerical accuracy ( except for some well identified anomalies @xcite ) .",
    "this shows rather unambiguously that the critical point of a slowly - driven sandpile coincides with that of its fes version , supports strongly the previously enunciated conjecture , and identifies stochastic sandpiles as belonging in the universality class of systems with many absorbing states and order parameter coupled to a static conserved field .",
    "moreover , the conserved reaction - diffusion model studied in @xcite has the notorious advantage of been susceptible to be mapped exactly using a a fock - space representation and creation - annihilation operators @xcite into an effective action , or equivalently into a set of langevin equations @xcite . remarkably , up to navely irrelevant terms",
    ", this set of equations coincides with eq.([lan ] ) .",
    "the additional irrelevant terms appearing in the exact mapping , might also be of some importance in lower dimensions ( this issue is currently under study ) .",
    "different stochastic sandpile models show critical properties that are fully compatible with those of their corresponding fes versions . using this equivalence stochastic sandpiles",
    "have been shown to belong in the universality class of systems exhibiting an absorbing - state phase transition with order parameter coupled to a static conserved density field .",
    "this result places sandpiles within the range of applicability of standard tools for the study of scale invariance in phase transitions , and constitutes in our opinion a step forward in the rationalizing soc .      * direct numerical integration of the langevin equations eq.([lan ] ) using the method of @xcite .",
    "this will provide an even more direct test for the validity of the langevin equations . * connection of the universality class discussed in this paper with that of the pinning - depinning transitions in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that these two classes are indeed the same ; we are working on the theoretical connections between them @xcite .",
