    "high precision metrology has recently been receiving a lot of attention @xcite due to the benefits to advanced science and technology .",
    "one common tool for high precision measurement is optical mach - zehnder interferometry , which typically contains two beam splitters ( bs ) .",
    "usually coherent light is split by the first bs , then one beam experiences a phase shift @xmath0 while the other is retained as a reference , and the two beams combine by a second bs",
    ". one can detect the output light to obtain the phase shift information .",
    "however the phase sensitivity , @xmath1 , is limited by the shot noise limit ( snl ) , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the mean photon number ) .",
    "this limit is due to the classical nature of the coherent state and can be surpassed by using nonclassical states of light , such as squeezed states @xcite and n00n states @xcite . with the help of the nonclassical states",
    "the phase sensitivity can achieve heisenberg limit ( hl ) @xmath4 .    another possibility for beating",
    "the snl is to use an interferometer in which the mixing of the optical beams is done through a nonlinear transformation , such as the su(1,1 ) interferometer as shown in fig .",
    "this type of interferometer , first proposed by yurke _",
    "et al_. @xcite , is described by the group su(1,1 ) , as opposed to su(2 ) , where nonlinear transformations are optical parametric amplifiers ( opa ) or four - wave mixers .",
    "et al_. @xcite pointed out that this type of interferometer can reach the hl but only with small photon numbers .",
    "recently , a new theoretical scheme was proposed to inject strong coherent light to  boost \" the photon number in an su(1,1 ) interferometer with intensity detection by plick",
    "_ et al_. @xcite .",
    "their scheme circumvents the small - photon - number problem . jing _",
    "et al_. @xcite reported the experimental realization of such an interferometer . in this nonlinear interferometer",
    ", the maximum output intensity can be much higher than the input due to the parametric amplification .",
    "et al_. @xcite investigated the loss effect on phase sensitivity of the su(1,1 ) interferometers with intensity detection . while they show that propagation losses degrade the phase sensitivity , it is still possible to beat snl even with a significant mount of loss .",
    "et al_. @xcite observed an improvement of 4.1 db in signal - to - noise ratio compared with an su(2 ) interferometer under the same operation condition .",
    "more recently , li _ et al_. @xcite showed that an su(1,1 ) interferometer with coherent and squeezed input states via homodyne detection can approach the hl .",
    "heisenberg - limited sensitivity of phase measurement is one goal of quantum optical metrology . for this purpose , the search for the optimal detection scheme still continues . here , we consider parity measurement as our detection scheme .",
    "parity detection was first proposed by bollinger _",
    "et al_. @xcite in 1996 to study spectroscopy with a maximally entangled state of trapped ions .",
    "it was later adopted for an optical interferometer by gerry @xcite .",
    "mathematically , parity detection is described by a simple , single - mode operator @xmath5 , which acts on the mode @xmath6 .",
    "hence , parity is simply the evenness or oddness of the photon number in an output mode . in experiments ,",
    "the parity operator can be implemented by using homodyne techniques @xcite for high power , or observing the photon - number distribution with a photon - number resolving detector for small photon numbers .    here",
    ", we still consider coherent and squeezed vacuum input light as in our previous work @xcite which focused on homodyne detection on su(1,1 ) interferometers . with the coherent state and squeezed vacuum state as the input , one can reduce the required intensity of input coherent states and obtain the same measurement sensitivity , which can eliminate the disadvantages due to using stronger coherent states .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these input states in an su(1,1 ) interferometer are shown to approach the heisenberg limit when the mean photon numbers in coherent state and squeezed vacuum state are roughly equal , with a stronger opa process ( strength @xmath7 ) .",
    "this optimal condition for su(1,1 ) interferometers is similar to the su(2 ) case @xcite . for a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) injected by coherent and squeezed vacuum light , the phase sensitivity with parity detection is @xmath8 .",
    "when a coherent state and squeezed vacuum state are in roughly equal intensities , @xmath9 , the phase sensitivity reaches the hl .    in this paper , we study parity detection on an su(1,1 ) interferometer with coherent and squeezed - vacuum input states .",
    "we found that parity detection can be regarded as an optimal measurement scheme since it has a slightly better phase sensitivity than homodyne detection . due to achieving the hl",
    ", we also compared the phase sensitivity with another quantum limit , the quantum cramr - rao bound ( qcrb ) which sets the ultimate limit for a set of probabilities that originated from measurements on a quantum system .",
    "the qcrb is asymptotically achieved by the maximum likelihood estimator and gives a detection - independent phase sensitivity @xmath10    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we first present the propagation of input fields through the su(1,1 ) interferometer .",
    "then we discuss how the phase sensitivity approaches the heisenberg limit and compare the phase sensitivity with the qcrb in section iii .",
    "last , we conclude with a summary .     the schematic diagram of su(1,1 ) interferometer .",
    "two opas take the place of two beam splitters in the traditional mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) describe the strength and phase shift in the opa process @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) denote two light beams in the different processes .",
    "the pump field between the two opas has a @xmath20 phase difference .",
    "@xmath0 : phase shift ; @xmath21 : mirrors . ]",
    "fig . [ fig1 ] presents the model of an su(1,1 ) interferometer , in which the opas replace the 50 - 50 beam splitters in a traditional mzi . here",
    "we consider a coherent light mixed with a squeezed vacuum light as input and  @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath25 are the annihilation ( creation ) operators corresponding to the two modes .",
    "after the first opa , one output is retained as a reference , while the other one experiences a phase shift .",
    "after the beams recombine in the second opa with the reference field , the outputs are dependent on the phase difference @xmath0 between the two modes .",
    "next , we will focus on the evolution of an su(1,1 ) interferometer in phase space .",
    "the initial wigner function of the input state , a product state @xmath26 , with coherent light amplitude @xmath27 , is given by@xmath28 with the wigner function of coherent and squeezed vacuum state being @xcite@xmath29 where @xmath30 has been set @xmath31 by appropriately fixing the irrelevant absolute phase @xmath32 .",
    "after propagation through the su(1,1 ) interferometer the output wigner function is written as@xmath33,\\ ] ] where the relation between variables is described by@xmath34{c}\\alpha_{i}\\\\ \\beta_{i}^{\\ast}\\end{array } \\right )   = \\hat{t}^{-1}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}\\alpha_{f}\\\\ \\beta_{f}^{\\ast}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the complex amplitudes of the beams in the mode @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively and @xmath39 is the conjugate of @xmath36 .",
    "generally , propagations through the first opa , phase shift and second opa are described by@xmath40{cc}u_{1 } & v_{1}\\\\ v_{1}^{\\ast } & u_{1}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\\\ \\hat{t}_{\\phi } & = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}e^{i\\phi } & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\\\",

    "therefore , the su(1,1 ) interferometer is described by @xmath45 .",
    "more specifically , we assume that the first opa and the second one have a @xmath20 phase difference ( particularly @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and same parametrical strength ( @xmath48 ) . in this case",
    ", the second opa will undo what the first one does ( namely @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) when phase shift @xmath51 , which we call a balanced situation .",
    "the input - output relation of variables has the following form@xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 therefore , the output wigner function of a nonlinear interferometer is described by@xmath57\\sinh(2r)}. \\label{wigner}\\ ] ]      parity measurement has been proved to be a efficient method of detection in interferometer for a wide range of input states @xcite . for many input states ,",
    "parity does as well , or nearly as well , as state - specific detection schemes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as has been reported recently , parity detection with a two - mode , squeezed - vacuum interferometer actually reaches below the heisenberg limit , achieving the quantum cramr - rao bound on phase sensitivity @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the sensitivity of phase estimation based on the outcome of the parity detection is estimated as@xmath62 which is a ratio of detection noise to the rate at which signal changes as a function of phase and @xmath63    the phase sensitivity with parity detection for an su(1,1 ) interferometer with coherent and squeezed vacuum states is found to be minimal at @xmath51 and is given by@xmath64+n_{s}+1\\}^{1/2}}\\nonumber\\\\ &   \\times\\frac{1}{[n_{\\text{opa}}(n_{\\text{opa}}+2)]^{1/2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the intensity of input coherent light , @xmath66 the intensity of the squeezed vacuum light , and @xmath67 the spontaneous photon number emitted from the first opa which is related to parametric strength . when @xmath68 the optimal phase sensitivity is found to be@xmath69^{1/2 } } , \\label{p}\\ ] ] where the subscript p indicates parity detection and the factor @xmath70 results from the input squeezed vacuum beam .",
    "if vacuum input is injected ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , the phase sensitivity with parity detection is reduced to @xmath73 $ ] , which is the same as result of yurke s scheme with intensity detection @xcite .",
    "in this section , we compare the optimal phase sensitivity of parity detection with the hl which is related to the total number of photon @xmath74 inside the interferometer , not the input photon number as the traditional mzi .",
    "the hl is given by @xmath75 where the subscript hl represents heisenberg limit .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite the total inside photon number is@xmath76 where the first term on the right - hand side , @xmath77 , results from the amplification process of the input photon number and the second one is related to the spontaneous process .",
    "thus the total inside photon number @xmath78 corresponds to not only the opa strength but also input photon number .",
    "when vacuum inputs are injected , the heisenberg limit is found to be @xmath79 while the corresponding phase sensitivity with parity detection is @xmath80 .",
