    "for instance , the half - metallic nature at the interface of sro / sto superlattices was predicted,@xcite but it has not been experimentally verified yet .",

    "in fact , systematic growth of sro ( 111 ) film on sto was accomplished only recently.@xcite in the experimental aspect , delicate control of the layer growth is required , especially for the first ml , due to the conversion tendency of highly volatile ru@xmath3 to sro@xmath4.@xcite it is naturally expected that changing the growth direction of system would produce totally distinct physical properties due to different coordination environment .",
    "indeed , recent studies on other perovskite ( 111 ) film or heterostructure systems showed rich exotic phenomena.@xcite as shown in fig .",

    "et al.__@xcite obtained the magnetization as large as 3.4 @xmath7/ru , which far exceeds the low - spin ( ls ) moment value of 2 @xmath7/ru .",
    "so they claimed the stabilization of the high - spin ( hs ) state ( 4@xmath7/ru ) in the sro ( 111 ) films .",
    "also , from the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) spectroscopy , they deduced the ratio of orbital / spin magnetic moment to obtain the large orbital magnetic moment of 0.24 - 0.32 @xmath7/ru.@xcite however , detailed study of electronic structure and magnetic properties of sro ( 111 ) films is lacking , and moreover , the hs phase of sro ( 111 ) film has not been reproduced by other groups yet .    in this paper , we have investigated characteristic features of ultrathin sro ( 111 ) film grown on sto , and compared its properties to those of ultrathin sro ( 001 ) film .",
    "based on the result of _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations , we have predicted termination - dependent magnetic behaviors of ultrathin sro ( 111 ) film .",
    "surprisingly , we have found that the interlayer afm structures are stabilized at the surfaces for both ru- and sro@xmath0-termination cases , but through fundamentally different mechanisms .",
    "further , we have obtained the half - metallic property for the sro@xmath0-terminated sro ( 111 ) film despite its surface interlayer afm structure . as for the spin state",
    ", we have not found any evidence of hs state in sro ( 111 ) films , contrary to the report by grutter _",
    "the calculations were performed by using the plane - wave basis set and the projector - augmented - wave method implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite additional calculations using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) band method were also employed for detailed analysis.@xcite for the exchange - correlation energy functional , we used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with pbesol functional.@xcite on - site coulomb correlation @xmath8 is treated with the gga@xmath9 method in the rotationally invariant form @xcite and the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) was taken into account when necessary .",

    "@xcite for @xmath14 ev , the dft+@xmath8 ( dft : density functional theory ) gives the half - metallic phase , which is not consistent with experiment , and even for @xmath15 ev , the calculated magnetic moment already exceeds the highest reported experimental value.@xcite therefore , in view of the existing results , we adopted the weak correlation value of @xmath16 = 1.0 ev , which describes the experimental results well .",
    "the relation of magnetic structure and correlation will be discussed further in the section iii . c.",
    "magnetic properties of sro film are strongly correlated with its ruo@xmath17 tilting and rotations.@xcite hence the layer - dependent structural evolution is expected to play an important role in the magnetic structure.@xcite in the case of sro ( 001 ) film , the degree of layer - dependent octahedral distortion is still controversial , but the suppression of tilting and rotation due to the substrate is not perfect even in the ultrathin limit.@xcite therefore , the magnetic structure of ultrathin ( 001 ) film depends not only on the number of mls but also on the evolution of tilting patterns that changes ru - o - ru bond connectivities . in the case of ( 111 )",

    "sro , the double exchange ( de ) mechanism is known to be responsible for its itinerant ferromagnetism.@xcite but , for the sro ( 111 ) film case , the electron hopping strength between bulk and surface ru ions becomes weakened due to the substantial rearrangements of ru-@xmath20 states near the surface .",
    "thereby , the interlayer afm structure follows as the kinetic exchange ( ke ) mechanism wins over the de at the surface , as provided schematically in fig .",

    "firstly , the surface atomic movements are not so prominent as for the ru - termination case . as shown in fig .",
    "[ smove](a ) and ( b ) , except for the surface sr atoms that tend to avoid exposure by moving in , the atomic relaxation gives simple outward expansions of the sro blocks due to lattice mismatch of the sro and sto .",
    "hence , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ sdos ] , the overall shapes of doss are similar between the ideal and the relaxed cases , and ru-@xmath20 occupation at the surface is also almost the same as those of inner layers ( fig .",
    "[ smove](c ) ) .",
    "surprisingly , the interlayer afm phase at the surface emerges for sro@xmath0-termination case too .",
    "distinctly from the ru - termination case , the afm phase occurs even from @xmath22=2 ( see fig .  [",
    "smag](a)).@xcite furthermore , the surface interlayer afm structure is already stabilized for an ideal film without the relaxation , which suggests that the atomic relaxation is not an essential ingredient for the surface magnetic structure of the sro@xmath0-termination case .",
    "since the relaxation at the surface is not considerable , even after the relaxation , the connectivity of ru - o - ru bond , which plays a key role in the magnetic interactions , is hardly changed from the ideal case .",
    "one can thus deduce that the driving mechanism of surface interlayer afm structure for the sro@xmath0-termination case would be different from that for the ru - termination case .    as mentioned above , in the case of ( 111 ) growth , ruo@xmath17 tilting and rotations are suppressed by symmetry , and so the ru - o - ru bond angle remains almost straight for every layers .",
    "this symmetry driven bond character plays a crucial role in determining magnetic interactions at the surface of sro@xmath0-terminated ( 111 ) film .",
    "note that the de interaction is proportional to the effective ru - ru hopping @xmath29 , while the ke to its square .",
    "hence the latter is more affected by the ru - o - ru bond angle than the former . as a result",
    ", the straight ru - o - ru bond would favor the afm ke over the fm de interaction .",

    "( b ) schematic magnetic interactions near the surface . , width=321 ]    for sro@xmath0-terminated ( 111 ) film , farther neighbor interactions are prohibited at the surface due to truncated film structure .",
    "hence the afm ke interaction becomes dominant over the fm de interaction at the surface , and so the interlayer afm structure can be stabilized , as shown in fig .",
    "[ smag](b ) .",
    "the dos in fig .",
    "[ sdos](b ) reveals that only the spin direction is flipped over at the surface ru atom with respect to those of inner ru atoms without much change in the shape of dos .",
    "very similar dos shapes for ideal and relaxed cases unambiguously represent the crucial role of truncated structure in the surface interlayer afm structure .",
    "noteworthy is that sro ( 111 ) film for the sro@xmath0-termination case has the half - metallic nature even for the relaxed case of fig .",
    "[ sdos](b ) .",
    "we have ascertained that this feature of surface interlayer afm and half - metallic nature is sustained for every ml cases .",

    "we considered the 1 ml sro@xmath0-termination case , which corresponds to the thinnest magnetic film .",
    "as shown in fig.[u ] , we found that the fm structure is more stable than the intralayer afm structure as long as @xmath31 2 ev .",
    "this implies that the sro ( 111 ) surface layer would have the stable intralayer fm structure as long as it belongs to the itinerant weak correlated system .",
    "remember that experimental findings in sro are better described by the dft calculation in the the weak correlation limit .",
    "hence this result demonstrates that our predicted surface interlayer afm structures for sro ( 111 ) films are robust . on the other hand , for @xmath32 ev , the the intralayer afm structure becomes stabilized .",
    "one comment here is that , for sro ( 001 ) film , mahadevan _ _ et al.__@xcite reported that the intralayer afm structure is a ground state at the surface , which is the origin of the mit .",
    "they used somewhat larger correlation parameter of @xmath8=2.5ev with @xmath33=0.4ev .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath34 , they also obtained a stable fm structure .",
    "both ours and mahadevan _ et al . _",
    "s result indicate that the use of correct correlation @xmath8 value is very important to describe the physics of sro systems properly .",
    "we have studied electronic and magnetic structures of sro film grown on ( 111 ) sto substrate using the _ ab initio _ band structure calculations .",
    "we have found that the interlayer afm structures emerge at the surfaces of both ru- and sro@xmath0-termination cases . for the ru - termination case ,",
    "the interlayer afm comes from the large atomic relaxation at the surface and the consequent dominant ke interaction . for sro@xmath0-termination case ,",
    "the growth symmetry prevents the tilting of ru - o - ru angles to favor the afm ke interaction over the fm de interaction within the truncated film structure .",

    "<S> both ru- and sro@xmath0-terminated sro ( 111 ) film show unexpected interlayer antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structure at the surface , but with different characters and mechanisms . the afm structure for the former results from the large surface atomic relaxation , whereas that for the latter results from the truncated film effect . </S>",
