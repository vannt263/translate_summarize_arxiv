    "the paradigm of information complexity has been quite successful recently in classical communication complexity .",
    "what started out as a useful tool for proving communication complexity lower bounds has recently developed into an important subfield of its own .",
    "the definition of information complexity , the sum of the mutual information between the protocol transcript and each player s input conditional on the other player s input , makes it possible to bring powerful tools from information theory to study interactive communication .",
    "many recent results show that this paradigm has enabled researchers to tackle questions that seemed out of reach not so long ago , like an exact characterization by braverman , garg , pankratov , and weinstein @xcite of the communication complexity of the disjointness function .",
    "the first results on information complexity were those of chakrabarti , shi , wirth and yao @xcite , who gave lower bounds for communication complexity in the simultaneous message passing model by defining what would now be called external information cost . a subsequent paper by bar - yossef , jayram , kumar and sivakumar @xcite implicitly defined what is now called the internal information cost , or simply information cost .",
    "they used it to prove communication complexity lower bounds for functions that can be built from simpler component functions , like the set disjointness function with respect to the and function .",
    "the recent wave of results started with a compression result of barak , braverman , chen and rao @xcite that had application in particular to proving a direct sum theorem for randomized communication complexity . in @xcite , braverman and rao give an exact operational interpretation of the information complexity as the amortized distributional communication complexity , which can be viewed as an analogue of the shannon source compression theorem for interactive protocols .",
    "in @xcite , braverman provides a prior - free definition for information complexity of classical functions , and presents a similar operational interpretation for worst case amortized communication complexity .",
    "since then , many results have been derived by using the information complexity paradigm  @xcite , witnessing its power .",
    "braverman provides a nice overview of results circa 2012 @xcite .",
    "it might appear surprising that the definition of this simple looking quantity , the information cost of a protocol , has such far reaching consequences .",
    "it is tempting to try to bring such a paradigm to the quantum setting and hopefully get comparable results .",
    "however , there are many difficulties in trying to get such a quantum generalization of information cost .",
    "firstly , due to monogamy of entanglement , there is no good notion of an overall transcript and its corresponding correlation with the localized inputs at the beginning of the protocol .",
    "indeed , it is only possible to evaluate quantum information quantities for quantum registers that are defined at the same moment in time .",
    "but then , the no - cloning theorem @xcite forbids copying of previous messages to generate a final transcript accounting for all communication in the quantum protocol , on which we could evaluate a quantum information cost . even for protocols with pre - shared entanglement and classical communication",
    ", the final classical transcript could be completely uncorrelated to the inputs .",
    "this can be seen for example in a protocol that teleports at each time step , which would generate a transcript that is uniformly distributed . however , notwithstanding these difficulties , jain , radhakrishnan and sen @xcite , as well as jain and nayak @xcite , gave different definitions for such a quantity with specific applications in mind .",
    "in particular , the definition in @xcite leads to a beautiful proof of a lower bound of @xmath2 on bounded round quantum communication complexity for ( size @xmath3 ) set disjointness computed by @xmath1-message protocols . note that the remark is made in @xcite that the optimal @xmath4 protocol of aaronson and ambainis @xcite can be adapted to yield a bounded round protocol achieving communication of @xmath5 .",
    "hence , this comes close to match the best known upper bound .",
    "however , even if these definitions can be successful for obtaining interesting results in a bounded round scenario , it is quite plausible that they are also limited to such applications .",
    "indeed , given these previous definitions of quantum information cost , it is quite easy to find particular inputs and protocols with @xmath1 messages and quantum communication cost @xmath6 such that the quantum information cost is @xmath7 .",
    "we believe that a more natural definition of quantum information cost would not have such a dependence on the round complexity of protocols .",
    "in contrast , the classical information cost directly provides a lower bound on the communication cost , and this property is crucial in many of its recent applications .",
    "hopefully , it would also lead to an operational interpretation analogous to the classical one for amortized quantum communication complexity .",
    "a related question was asked by braverman @xcite , on how to define the correct quantum analogue of information complexity .",
    "we show that despite the previously mentioned setbacks , it is possible to define a quantum information cost quantity for protocols and a corresponding quantum information complexity quantity for channels that satisfies the two important properties asked for above .",
    "first , they are lower bounds on the quantum communication cost and quantum communication complexity of the corresponding protocols and channels , respectively .",
    "secondly , we can compress asymptotically any protocol to its quantum information cost , and so we can give the operational interpretation for quantum information complexity as the amortized quantum communication complexity . that is , the quantum communication complexity per copy for implementing @xmath3 copies of the channel , in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath3 .",
    "the quantity that we consider would be the fully quantum analogue of the distributional information complexity of functions : we study the quantum information complexity of a channel on some arbitrary quantum input . in the case of a so - called classical input",
    ", this corresponds to a probability distribution . when implementing a bipartite channel with a protocol on a general input , we allow for some small error @xmath8 in the trace distance with respect to a reference system purifying the input .",
    "the introduction of the reference system is to ensure that our implementation maintains correlations with the outside world as well as the actual channel . for classical inputs and functions ,",
    "we show that this implies a bound on the probability of failure , in the sense of a classical average on the input distribution , of the quantum protocol for computing the function .",
    "hence , this links our quantity to the distributional quantum communication complexity of classical functions .",
    "when implementing @xmath3 copies of a general channel , the success criterion is that for each instance of the channel , the error is bounded by @xmath8 .    to circumvent the difficulties we mentionned in defining a quantum generalization of information cost and complexity , we take a different perspective on the classical definitions",
    "indeed , our main insight in defining such quantities comes by using a rewriting of the information cost of a protocol that was already implicit in previous works on information complexity .",
    "we reinterpret this quantity by viewing each message generation in the protocol as a noisy channel whose output is to be sent over a noiseless channel .",
    "then , message transmission is viewed as the simulation , over a noiseless channel , of a noisy channel with feedback to the sender and side information at the receiver .",
    "this is a variant of what is known as a ( tensor power input ) classical reverse shannon theorem in the information theory literature .",
    "using previously known results @xcite , we obtain an alternate , simple proof of the operational interpretation of classical information complexity .",
    "an additional feature of this proof in contrast to the one of braverman and rao @xcite is that it maintains the round complexity of the original protocol , since these results about noisy channel simulation use only unidirectional transmission . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first proof to establish that the @xmath1-message information complexity is exactly equal to the @xmath1-message amortized communication complexity .",
    "note however that this proof only works in the asymptotic limit , so we do not get as a bonus of the techniques used for our coding theorem a compression theorem for a single copy of the protocol .",
    "it is reasonable to hope that eventual results on so - called one - shot unidirectional coding theorems might lead to interesting results about bounded round , single copy protocol compression . using this perspective on classical information cost",
    ", we can more easily define a quantum generalization .",
    "the right quantum analogue of the reverse shannon task with feedback and side information is quantum state redistribution , for which devetak and yard give an optimal protocol @xcite . with these tools in hands , we then define the quantum analogues of information cost and complexity , and prove their operational interpretations .",
    "in addition , we also prove some interesting properties of these quantities .",
    "in particular , it is an almost immediate consequence of the definition that the quantum information cost of a protocol lower bounds its quantum communication cost , and then a similar result holds for quantum communication complexity relative to channels .",
    "we also prove that with our definition , the quantum information complexity is an additive quantity , and that it is convex and continuous in the channel and error parameter .",
    "finally , relative to input states , we prove a concavity result on quantum information cost . at this point ,",
    "given this operational interpretation and the fact that information is a lower bound on communication , we might argue that this corresponds to the right quantum analogue of the information complexity .    to demonstrate the potential of the quantum information complexity paradigm , we reduce the quantum information complexity of the disjointness function to that of the and function , a reduction along similar lines as that of @xcite . in contrast to the quantum reduction of @xcite ,",
    "we are able to get rid of a factor @xmath9 for quantum protocols with @xmath1 messages . given that their lower bound for bounded round complexity for @xmath3-bit disjointness is @xmath10 , we are thus optimistic that this reduction by a factor of @xmath9 using our approach could lead to a lower bound of @xmath11 , thus matching the best currently known upper bound @xcite . like classical information cost , our quantity is defined in terms of conditional mutual information , a quantity that has been notoriously hard to lower bound in the quantum setting @xcite .",
    "we leave as an interesting open problem to develop tools for lower bounding the conditional mutual information in our setting , and to see if we can obtain such a result for the disjointness function .",
    "we explore other potential applications in the conclusion .",

    "we fix the notation that we use for quantum mechanics , present the necessary quantum information theory background , define formally the quantum communication model that we use and also define quantum communication complexity in this model .",
    "we then present a perspective on classical information complexity that leads us to a quantum generalization , then give such a definition of quantum information complexity and finally prove its operational interpretation in the following section .",
    "we also explore some of the properties of our definition , and then go on to discuss some potential applications .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results , additional potential applications , and further research directions .",
    "we use the following notation for quantum theory ; see @xcite for more details .",

    "another important example of channel that we use is the partial trace @xmath38 which effectively gets rid of the @xmath19 subsystem . fixing a basis @xmath39 for @xmath19 ,",

    "we also denote @xmath44 to express that we want to keep only the @xmath12 register . fixing a basis",
    "also allows us to talk about classical states and joint states : @xmath45 is classical ( with respect to this basis ) if it is diagonal in basis @xmath39 , i.e.  @xmath46 for some probability distribution @xmath47 .",
    "more generally , subsystem @xmath19 of @xmath48 is said to be classical if we can write @xmath49 for some @xmath50 .",
    "an important example of a channel mapping a quantum system to a classical one is the measurement channel @xmath51 , defined as @xmath52 for any @xmath45 .",
    "often , @xmath53 will be used to discuss general systems , while @xmath54 will be reserved for classical systems . for a state @xmath55 ,",
    "a purification is a pure state @xmath56 satisfying @xmath57 . if @xmath58 has dimension at least that of @xmath12 , then such a purification always exists . for a given @xmath58 ,",

    "a unitary extension is a unitary @xmath60 with @xmath61 for some fixed @xmath62 .",

    "such an extension always exists provided @xmath64 is of dimension at least @xmath65 ( note that we also must have @xmath66 ) .",
    "the notion of distance we use is the trace distance , defined for two states @xmath67 as the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of their difference : @xmath68 it has an operational interpretation as four times the best bias possible in a state discrimination test between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the subscript tells on which subsystems the trace distance is evaluated , and remaining subsystems might need to be traced out .",
    "we use the following results about trace distance . for proofs of these and other standard results in quantum information theory that we use , see @xcite .",
    "the trace distance is monotone under noisy channels : for any @xmath71 and @xmath59 , @xmath72 for unitaries , the equality becomes an identity , a property called unitary invariance of the trace distance .",
    "hence , for any @xmath73 and any @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 also , the trace distance can not be increased by adjoining an uncorrelated system : for any @xmath76 @xmath77 it follows that the trace distance obeys a property that we call joint linearity : for a classical system @xmath78 and two states @xmath79 , @xmath80    the measure of information that we use is the von neumann entropy , defined for any state @xmath81 as @xmath82 in which we take the convention that @xmath83 , justified by a continuity argument . all logarithms are taken base @xmath84 . note that @xmath85 is invariant under unitaries applied on @xmath15 .",
    "if the state to be evaluated is clear from context , we might drop the subscript .",
    "conditional entropy for a state @xmath86 is then defined as @xmath87 mutual information as @xmath88 and conditional mutual information as @xmath89 note that mutual information and conditional mutual information are symmetric in interchange of @xmath90 . for any pure bipartite state @xmath41 ,",
    "the entropy on each subsystem is the same : @xmath91 for isomorphic @xmath92 , a maximally entangled state @xmath93 is a pure state satisfying @xmath94 .",
    "for a system @xmath12 of dimension @xmath95 and any @xmath96 , we have the bounds @xmath97 the conditional mutual information satisfy a chain rule : for any @xmath98 , @xmath99 for product states @xmath100 , entropy is additive , @xmath101 and so there is no conditional mutual information between product system , @xmath102 and conditioning on a product system is useless , @xmath103 more generally , @xmath104 two important properties of the conditional mutual information are strong subadditivity and the data processing inequality : we consider an equivalent rewriting of strong subadditivity , which states that conditional mutual information is non - negative . for any @xmath105 and @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , @xmath108 for classical systems ,",
    "conditioning is equivalent to taking an average : for any @xmath109 , for a classical system @xmath78 and some appropriate @xmath110 , @xmath111      we want to study in full generality the quantum communication complexity of bipartite quantum channels on particular input states .",
    "this is the generalization of distributional communication complexity of classical functions to the fully quantum setting , and contains as a special case the distributional quantum communication complexity of classical functions .",
    "the model for communication complexity that we consider is the following .",
    "for a given bipartite channel @xmath112 and input state @xmath113 , alice and bob are given input registers @xmath114 at the outset of the protocol , respectively , and they output registers @xmath115 at the end of the protocol , respectively , which should be in state @xmath116 .",
    "we generally allow for some small error @xmath8 in the output , which will be formalized below . in the usual communication complexity",

    "a protocol @xmath120 for implementing @xmath32 on input @xmath121 is defined by a sequence of unitaries @xmath122 along with a pure state @xmath123 shared between alice and bob , for arbitrary finite dimensional registers @xmath124 . for appropriate finite dimensional memory registers @xmath125 held by alice , @xmath126 held by bob , and communication registers @xmath127 exchanged by alice and bob ,",
    "we have ( see figure [ fig : prot ] ) @xmath128 .",
    "we slightly abuse notation and also write @xmath120 to denote the channel implemented by the protocol , i.e. @xmath129 then we say that a protocol @xmath120 for implementing channel @xmath32 on input @xmath121 , with purification @xmath130 for a reference system @xmath58 , has error @xmath131 $ ] if @xmath132 . if we want to restrict this set to bounded round protocols with @xmath1 messages , we write @xmath133 . note that for simplicity , we only define protocols with an even number of messages ; our results also hold without this restriction , though in the special case of one round protocols , we would rather consider bipartite channels with a single output to ensure that the quantum communication complexity is well - defined .",
    "the introduction of the reference system @xmath58 is essential to ensure that the protocol preserves any correlation the input state might have with the outside world as well as the channel it is supposed to implement .",
    "as said before , for classical functions on classical input distributions , we prove a lemma in section [ sec : cltd ] that relates this to the probability of failure of the protocol on such a distribution .",
    "note that in the standard context of quantum communication complexity , our model would be akin to the model introduced by cleve and buhrman @xcite , with pre -shared entanglement ( though the fact that we use quantum communication here instead of classical communication as in the original model could lead to an improvement up to a factor of two of the communication complexity , due to superdense coding @xcite , but no more , due to the teleportation protocol @xcite ) , rather than to the model introduced by yao @xcite , in which parties locally initialize their registers .",
    "this is the natural analogue of the framework for classical information complexity in which parties are allowed shared randomness for free , and this seems to be necessary to obtain the operational interpretation of information complexity , classical and quantum , as the amortized communication complexity .",
    "known proofs of the additivity property rely heavily on the availability of shared resources to perform some kind of simulation .",
    "this is also true of many other interesting properties of information complexity . even though additivity and other results might not hold in the yao model , studying information complexity in this model",
    "might still make sense : we would first have to restrict ourselves to protocols in which the pre - shared state @xmath134 is a pure product state .",
    "however , the definition of quantum information complexity would need to be somewhat modified , since the definition we give in section [ sec : qic ] allows for entanglement distribution at no cost , which is consistent with our cleve - buhrman like model of communication .    as was said before",
    ", our framework is the quantum generalization of the one for distributional information complexity , and so let us formally define the different quantities that we work with .    for a protocol @xmath120 as defined above , we define the _ quantum communication cost _ of @xmath120 as @xmath135    note that we do not require that @xmath136 for some @xmath137 , as is usually done .",
    "this will not affect our definition on information cost and complexity , nor on amortized communication complexity , but might affect the single - copy quantum communication complexity by at most a factor of two .",
    "the corresponding notion of quantum communication complexity of a channel is :    for a bipartite channel @xmath138 , an input state @xmath139 and an error parameter @xmath131 $ ] , we define the @xmath8-error _ quantum communication complexity _ of @xmath32 on input @xmath15 as @xmath140    note that this quantity is discontinuous in its parameters . also note that no good",
    "bound is known on the size of the entangled state that might be required to achieve this minimum .",
    "see @xcite for a recent discussion on related issues in a different setting .",
    "we make the following trivial remark that quantum communication complexity is decreasing in the error parameter , that it vanishes for @xmath141 , that it is bounded by @xmath142 , and that it also vanishes for any pure state @xmath15 . at @xmath141 , it is because the trace distance is saturated at @xmath84 and so we can consider a protocol that outputs anything without communication , while for pure states it is because there is no correlation with the outside world , so we can consider a protocol that is given , as entanglement for the protocol , the output of the channel acting on the pure state , and outputs it without communication .",
    "for any @xmath143 , the following holds : @xmath144 also , for any @xmath145 $ ] , the following holds for any pure state @xmath15 : @xmath146    we have the following definition for bounded round quantum communication complexity , and similar remarks hold .    for a bipartite channel @xmath138 , an input state @xmath139,an error parameter @xmath131 $ ] and a bound @xmath147 on the number of messages , we define the @xmath1-message , @xmath8-error _ quantum communication complexity _ of @xmath32 on input @xmath15 as @xmath148    we are also interested in the amortized quantum communication complexity of channels . a protocol @xmath149 is said to compute the @xmath3-fold product channel @xmath150 on input @xmath151 with error @xmath8 if for all @xmath152 $ ] , @xmath153 we have implicitly used the fact that it is possible to find a purification of @xmath154 with a decomposition of the purifying register @xmath155 , and with the @xmath156-th copy of @xmath15 purified by the reference subregister @xmath157",
    "this error criterion corresponds to the one achieved when sequentially simulating @xmath3 times channel @xmath32 on input @xmath15 , each time with error @xmath8 , and is weaker than demanding to simulate it @xmath3 times with overall error @xmath8 .",
    "the reason for this is that asking for overall error @xmath8 could be a much harder task .",
    "indeed , consider a purified input state that is @xmath8 away in trace distance to a state which is product with respect to the @xmath158 bipartite cut . then , since the trace distance is monotone under noisy channels , the parties can simulate the channel at zero communication cost and achieve error @xmath8 by taking , as part of the entanglement of their protocol , the @xmath159 registers of the channel acting on that product state .",
    "thus the quantum information complexity is also zero .",
    "we can then also achieve the task of amortized quantum communication complexity with @xmath8 error in each input at zero communication .",
    "however , using the operational interpretation of the trace distance as the best bias in a distinguishability experiment , the amortized quantum communication task in which we ask for overall error @xmath8 can not be achieved at zero communication cost , since having access to many instances of the output state allows for better distinguishability whenever starting with distinguishability greater than zero between the actual input and the product state @xcite .",
    "hence , if we want to obtain the intended operational interpretation , we have to settle for such a success parameter .",

    "the main difference from the standard definition is not so much in the formal rewriting of this definition , which to some extent was already implicitly used in previous proofs @xcite and is simply an application of the chain rule and basic properties of mutual information .",

    "sometimes it is also defined by taking the average length instead of the maximum ; this does not affect the results here .",
    "the standard definition of the information cost is then as the sum of two conditional mutual informations , @xmath185 and the corresponding intuition for this quantity is that it represents the amount of information leaked by the transcript to alice about bob s input plus that leaked to bob about alice s input .",
    "this definition is shown in @xcite to lead to an equality between information complexity and the distributional amortized communication complexity .",
    "we would like to show such a theorem about an analogous quantum information cost quantity .",
    "however , many problems seem to arise when trying to generalize the above quantity to the quantum setting . before proposing such a definition ,",
    "we first give an alternate characterization of classical information cost , along with the corresponding operational intuition , which will be more amenable to a quantum generalization .",
    "note that an interesting consequence of our perspective versus those on sampling complexity that have been studied before is that it enables us to use some previously proved tools from information theory , namely ( tensor power source ) classical reverse shannon theorems .",
    "we define an alternate information cost for classical communication protocols as @xmath186 in which we distinguish between alice s and bob s copy of the public randomness @xmath58 and messages @xmath169 .",
    "note that this is easily seen to be equivalent to the standard definition for @xmath187 , by using the chain rule for mutual information along with the fact that @xmath188 and @xmath189 are just copies of one another .",
    "however , it is not so much in the formal statement that the rewriting is interesting , but in the operational interpretation .",
    "indeed , the above characterization comes from viewing each conditional message @xmath172 in the protocol as a noisy channel in which the output @xmath1 is sent over a noiseless channel to a receiver who has side information @xmath190 about the input @xmath191 to the channel , but for which also a copy @xmath192 of the output is given as feedback to the sender .",
    "the problem of simulating the sending of the output of a noisy channel with feedback has been studied in the literature under the name of classical reverse shannon theorem @xcite , and when there is side information @xmath190 at the receiver , @xmath193 characterizes the amount of information that needs to be sent over the noiseless channel from sender to receiver .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that asymptotically , this task can be accomplished at a ( unidirectional ) classical communication rate of @xmath193 when sufficient shared randomness is present . in @xcite ,",
    "a correlated sampling protocol is used to perform a similar task in a one - shot setting , but such that the same communication efficiency is achieved on average , to first order .",
    "a caveat is that their protocol to do so is interactive , while the one in @xcite is not .",
    "this result yields a simulation protocol for amortized communication that asymptotically achieves communication at the information cost of the protocol , while keeping the same round complexity , and error parameter arbitrarily close to the original one .",
    "another nice property of reverse shannon theorems is that they also give bounds on the amount of extra shared randomness required in the asymptotic limit for channel simulation .",
    "we do not give the details of the proof here , it follows along the same line as the one for the quantum case .",
    "we also do not discuss optimality here ( see the quantum case , or @xcite for such discussions ) .",
    "finally , we are ready to define quantum information cost and complexity ! as we already said , the notion of information cost of a protocol does not seem to easily extend to the quantum setting , mainly due to the fact that there is no direct analogue for a transcript in the quantum setting . also , the reversibility of quantum computation allows for protocols in which nothing remains at the end of the distributed computation except for the initial inputs and the output of the function evaluated on these inputs ( up to some small error for approximate protocols ) .",
    "these issues brought braverman @xcite to wonder what was the right quantum analogue of information cost , and whether there always existed protocols for computing binary functions that had quantum information cost bounded by a constant .",
    "some attempts at trying to define a quantum analogue of information cost have appeared before @xcite , and have proven useful for tackling particular problems .",
    "however , none of these seems to define the right notion in a context of amortized communication complexity . in particular",
    "there is an implicit dependence on the round complexity for these notions , and they only provide a lower bound on the communication cost once divided by the number of rounds . defining such a notion would hopefully lead to an interesting tool , in particular to obtain lower bounds and to tackle direct sum questions in quantum communication complexity .",
    "the main goal of our work is to present such a notion in a strong sense : we define a notion of quantum information complexity which is exactly equal to the amortized communication complexity .    from the alternate definition of the information cost in the preceding section",
    ", we can more easily extend it to a notion of quantum information cost for quantum protocols . a thing that might still cause",
    "problem is that we can not keep a copy of a channel input and output at the sender .",
    "these issues have already been discussed in particular when discussing connections between the fully quantum slepian - wolf theorem @xcite and the fully quantum reverse shannon theorem @xcite , and when discussing the fully quantum generalization of channel simulation with side information at the receiver @xcite .",
    "the correct quantum analogue of this is that what stays at the sender is the coherent feedback of the environment output of the noisy channel s isometric extension , and what is to be transmitted at the receiver is the usual output of the channel . in our situation , there is also another system in play , the side information already in the possession of the receiver before the transmission .",
    "the correct problem to consider in this case is then quantum state redistribution @xcite . in quantum state redistribution , there are @xmath194 systems of interest . at the outset of the protocol , the @xmath195 systems are in the possession of alice , and would be for us the coherent feedback of the noisy channel and the output to be transmitted , respectively , while bob holds the side information @xmath19 , and the @xmath196 joint system is purified by a reference register @xmath58 that no party has access to .",
    "thus , the only system changing hands is the @xmath6 subsystem that is to be transmitted from alice to bob .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that this can be accomplished , in the limit of asymptotically many copies of this task , at a communication cost of @xmath197 qubits per copy , along with an entanglement cost of @xmath198 ebits per copy ( with entanglement generated instead of consumed if this is negative ) .",

    "all remaining messages , would have @xmath457 , for @xmath1 messages and @xmath3 bits inputs .",
    "the communication is of the order of @xmath458 , so for @xmath459 , since we are interested in the regime @xmath460 , this is a factor of @xmath1 more than the communication .",
    "in contrast to their notion , our definition of quantum information cost is bounded by the communication .",
    "if we could get a bound proportional to theirs for @xmath461 , we would get a lower bound of @xmath462 on communication , thus matching the best known upper bound for bounded round quantum protocol for @xmath395 .",
    "we conjecture that this is the case , and so that this is worth looking into .",
    "note however that this would probably require new techniques to lower bound the conditional quantum mutual information , a quantity which is notoriously hard to lower bound @xcite .",
    "we further discuss these issues in the conclusion .",
    "we have defined a new notion of quantum information cost and a corresponding notion of quantum information complexity .",
    "in contrast to previously defined notions , these directly provide a lower bound on the communication , independent of round complexity . to define the quantum information cost of a protocol on an input quantum state , we take a detour through classical information cost and provide a different perspective on it , relating it to noisy channels simulation with side information at the receiver , a variant of the classical reverse shannon theorem studied in information theory .",
    "this provides a different proof that the information complexity is an achievable rate for amortized communication complexity , one that preserves the round complexity , and leads to an easier quantum generalization than the transcript based view on classical information cost . using this quantum generalization",
    ", we provide an operational interpretation for the @xmath8-error quantum information complexity of a channel @xmath32 on input @xmath15 as the @xmath8-error amortized quantum communication complexity of @xmath32 on input @xmath15 , and in this sense provides the right quantum generalization of the classical information complexity .",
    "we prove some interesting properties of quantum information complexity , like additivity and convexity .",
    "we also prove that on channels implementing , with @xmath8 error , through a protocol @xmath120 , a classical function @xmath463 on a classical input distributed according to @xmath167 , the error criterion that we use provides an upper bound on the average probability of failure , @xmath464 \\leq   \\frac{{\\varepsilon}}{2}$ ] , hence giving it an operational meaning in the context of quantum information complexity of classical functions .",
    "an important application of classical information complexity is to prove communication complexity lower bounds , and it is reasonable to hope that quantum information complexity will lead to interesting lower bound on quantum communication complexity . in @xcite , the authors use a different quantum generalization of information cost to derive an elegant proof of a lower bound on the bounded round quantum communication complexity of set disjointness . for @xmath1-message protocols , the authors prove a lower bound of @xmath449 on the quantum communication complexity of @xmath395 , close to the best known upper bound of @xmath5",
    ". however , the notion of quantum information cost that they use can be as high as @xmath7 for @xmath1-message protocols communicating @xmath6 qubits .",
    "could we use our notion of quantum information cost , which does not have this possible dependence on @xmath1 , to close the gap and prove a lower bound of @xmath465 on the quantum communication complexity ?",
    "we are able to show that on ( @xmath3-fold tensor ) classical inputs with no support for @xmath466 , the quantum communication cost of any good protocol ( with low error on all input ) for @xmath395 is at least @xmath3 times the quantum information cost for any good protocol for the and function on the same input .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite they obtain a bound of at least @xmath467 times for a related quantity . however , we fall short of proving a @xmath468 lower bound on the quantum information cost of good protocols for the and function .",
    "the reason for this is that , for the moment , we lack the necessary tools to lower bound the quantum information cost , which is defined as a sum of conditional mutual information with a quantum conditioning register . in @xcite",
    "the conditioning system is classical , and conditioning on a classical system is equivalent to taking an average .",
    "they are then able , through a clever combination of a local transition lemma and an average encoding theorem , to relate the sum of the square roots of all terms in their quantum information cost quantity to the probability of success of the @xmath1-message protocol .",
    "the round dependent lower bound follows by using a convexity argument to put these terms inside the square root .",
    "could we do something similar ?",
    "the conditional quantum mutual information has an history of being hard to lower bound @xcite , but hopefully recent developments in quantum information theory will help in this task .",
    "in particular , berta , seshadreesan and wilde lists many rewriting of the conditional mutual information in terms of a divergence quantity @xcite ; hopefully it will be possible to use such a rewriting to derive an analogue of the average encoding theorem @xcite with a quantum conditioning register .",
    "note that the purifying register @xmath58 can play the role of a classical system for us , since by the data processing inequality we can measure it first and still obtain a valid lower bound .",
    "maybe another approach to lower bound quantum information complexity would be to try to extend to the quantum setting the powerful approach of kerenidis , laplante , lerays and roland through zero - error protocols @xcite .",
    "note that chailloux and scarpa define a notion of superposed information cost @xcite appropriate for entangled games with no communication to obtain an exponential decay result for parallel repetition of such games .",
    "is there a connexion between this quantity and ours ?",
    "we are confident that this new notion of quantum information complexity will stimulate interesting developments in quantum communication complexity , as well as in quantum information theory to obtain tools that would prove helpful for such developments .",
    "interesting directions for this research program is first to obtain interesting lower bound on the quantum information complexity of specific functions , possibly by developing further techniques for lower bounding the conditional mutual information .",
    "also , with the operational interpretation that we prove for quantum information complexity , this opens the door to the study of direct sum questions in quantum communication complexity .",
    "a direct sum results shows that to implement @xmath3 instances of a task requires something on the order of @xmath3 times the resources needed to implement a single instance of the task .",
    "hence , the ability to compress the best protocols down to something close to their quantum information cost would lead to a direct sum result .",
    "a first step in this direction could be to try to obtain such a single - copy compression result for bounded round protocols , possibly by using a one - shot version of the state redistribution protocol .",
    "however , the one - shot result of @xcite does not seem to be sufficient for this purpose .",
    "does there exist one - shot protocols for state redistribution , possibly interactive , that would enable us to obtain interesting compression results for the bounded round scenario ?",
    "note that a quantum generalisation of the correlated sampling protocol of braverman and rao @xcite has been proved recently @xcite . in this quantum version ,",
    "if alice knows the spectral decomposition of a state @xmath15 , bob knows the spectral decomposition of a state @xmath63 , and both know the relative entropy @xmath469 between these , then using shared entanglement , bob can sample a state @xmath470 close to @xmath15 at communication cost proportional to @xmath471 .",
    "can we further generalize this to a setting with quantum side information , to compress messages while keeping quantum correlation ?",
    "another interesting research direction would be to try to obtain the quantum analogue of the result about a prior - free information cost and its relation to worst - case amortized communication complexity . a first approach to try for",
    "this problem could be to obtain a composable quantum reverse shannon theorem on arbitrary input , with feedback and side information at the receiver that would be tailor - made for our purpose .",
    "however , even in the case without side information at the receiver , it is known that for the arbitrary input case , standard entanglement , such as maximally entangled states , is not sufficient , and more exotic forms of entanglement such as entanglement embezzling states @xcite are needed @xcite . as is made clear from our direct coding theorem , those reverse shannon theorems achieve a stronger , global error parameter than the more local one that we require .",
    "are these forms of entanglement also required in this restricted scenario ?    finally , it would be interesting to see if the quantum information complexity paradigm would enable to shed some light on the question of equivalence between the model of yao versus the model of cleve - buhrman for quantum communication complexity .",
    "our communication model is closer to the cleve - buhrman one , and we use the pre - shared entanglement in a crucial way in many of our results . it would be possible in principle , even though the interpretation might not be the same , to define the quantum information complexity in the yao model by restricting the infimum to be taken over protocols where the state @xmath134 is a pure product state .",
    "but since we can distribute entanglement at no cost with our definition of quantum information cost , what would be an appropriate definition in this setting ? would it be any easier to relate the information complexity in these two models than it is to relate the corresponding communication complexities ? and what about amortized communication complexity ?",

    "the material in this section is more exploratory in nature , and is still work in progress .",
    "correspondingly , the presentation will be less formal , but ideas from the previous sections can be used to formalize the material here . it can safely be skipped without affecting understanding in the other sections .",
    "the classical external information cost is defined as @xmath472 , and is usually viewed as a measure of how much information the protocol leaks about the input to an external observer , being an allowed observer or a potential eavesdropper .",
    "it is a natural quantity to use for example in the standard communication complexity setting with cryptographic consideration , and also in the simultaneous message passing model , in which alice and bob must send simultaneously a single message to an external referee who must produce the output .",
    "we give two alternative interpretations of this quantity , one in the standard communication complexity setting , and one in a generalization of the simultaneous message passing model .",
    "we then show that the quantum generalizations give rise to two different quantities , even though they were both characterized by a unique classical quantity , and so the external information cost has a dual role depending on the interpretation we want to give it .",
    "let us first define the generalization of the simultaneous message passing model that we consider .",
    "we consider the same definition for classical protocols as given in section [ sec : bas ] , but the difference is now in the output : instead of having as output of the protocol alice and bob outputting some function of the transcript and their local input , we now want to have an external referee @xmath58 generating the output to the protocol by computing some function of the transcript only .",
    "if we want to obtain the simultaneous message model from this generalization , we restrict protocols to two messages , and require the following markov condition : @xmath473 , i.e.  the second message must be independent of the first message when conditioned on the input @xmath474 and shared randomness @xmath58 .    the important point to notice is that now , when compressing the protocol , we must insure that the referee gets all the necessary information in the transcript .",
    "we define an alternate external information cost quantity as @xmath475 , in which we distinguish between alice s , bob s and the referee s copy of the public randomness @xmath58 and the messages @xmath169 .",
    "note that this is easily seen to be equivalent to @xmath476 , using a similar argument as for the internal information cost , along with a combination of the chain rule and the markov condition on messages versus the inputs : @xmath477 for even @xmath156 , and @xmath478 for odd @xmath156 .",
    "similar to the case for internal information cost , the external information cost can then be viewed as an asymptotically achievable cost for transferring the messages such that both the other player and the referee can get the information , in the limit of many protocols .",
    "we then get an operational interpretation for the external information complexity as an achievable amortized communication complexity in this setting with an external referee .",
    "it is then clear that the external information should be interesting in the simultaneous message passing model .",
    "note that this setting in the interactive case is interesting only when the entropy of @xmath463 , for @xmath463 the output function , is much larger than the internal information complexity , since otherwise alice and bob can simply compute @xmath463 at this cost and send the result to the referee at small additional cost .",
    "it is less straightforward to generalize this to the quantum setting , mostly due to the fact that we can not send a copy of messages to both the other player and to a referee in the quantum setting .",
    "the quantum generalization of this setting would be the following : given a quantum channel @xmath479 and input state @xmath113 , alice and bob are given input register @xmath114 at the outset of the protocol , respectively , and the referee should output register @xmath480 at the end of the protocol , which should be in state @xmath481 up to some small error . in the protocol , at each time step , after applying their unitary , the players send a communication register to the other player , and another one to the referee , and keep some quantum memory .",
    "they want to minimize the total communication cost , that is , the sum of the cost from player to referee , and from player to player .",
    "the players and the referee can share an arbitrary tripartite entangled state at the outset of the protocol . a reasonable external quantum information cost for this setting , with the operational interpretation of being an asymptotically achievable rate of total communication , would follow in the same way as the standard quantum information cost quantity , from repeated application of state redistribution , along with an appropriate partition of the side information and unavailable information in this setting .",
    "if we instead want to take the eavesdropper view on the external information cost , we go back to the standard two - party communication complexity setting , and want to consider a passive eavesdropper , who has access to previous correlation , to all communication and to all garbage information from the protocol at the end ( classically , this would be the transcript ) , but is not allowed to alter the communication .",
    "however , this quantity , when evaluated in a quantum setting for classical functions and inputs would be bounded by a constant due to the fact that a passive quantum eavesdropper can not listen to the quantum communication , and due to the presence of reversible computing in the quantum world ( see @xcite for a discussion ) , which would limit the amount of information the passive eavesdropper would get at the end .",
    "note that this channel simulation view of information cost also leads rather straightforwardly to possibly interesting definitions of information cost in a multipartite setting , in particular in a model with some external coordinator , as an achievable rate of total asymptotic communication which lower bounds single - copy communication .",
    "it is then possible to define appropriate quantum generalizations , by carefully adapting the model , and then once again by considering repeated application of state redistribution .",
    "of course , the interest of such information cost quantities find their interest in potential applications .",
