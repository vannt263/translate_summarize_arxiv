    "one of the questions we address in this paper is    question 1 : _ given a fixed domain @xmath0 containing the origin @xmath1 in its interior , what is the geometry of the cell containing @xmath1 in a voronoi tessellation generated by the union of @xmath1 with a poisson point process whose intensity goes to infinity outside @xmath0 and equals @xmath2 inside ? _",
    "this cell converges _ from outside _ to the convex set of points which are closer to the origin than the boundary of @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig : question1 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic means of the defect area , defect perimeter and number of vertices of this voronoi cell .",
    "it turns out that the following dual question is the first and key step in answering this problem .",
    "question 2 : _ given a fixed convex body @xmath3 containing @xmath1 in its interior , what is the geometry of the zero - cell of a voronoi tessellation generated by the union of @xmath1 with a poisson point process conditioned on this zero - cell to contain @xmath3 as its intensity goes to infinity ?",
    "_    question @xmath4 is a special case of question @xmath5 since the conditioning means that the poisson point process has uniform intensity outside twice the voronoi flower of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig : question2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the answer to question @xmath4 can be deduced from the answer to question @xmath5 when the domain @xmath0 is a voronoi flower .    in order to treat question @xmath5 in the case of a general domain @xmath0",
    ", we have to prove that , up to higher orders , the quantities we consider coincide with what we find for question @xmath4 when @xmath0 is replaced by the maximal voronoi flower contained in @xmath0 .    as in the question of the approximation of a convex body @xmath3",
    "_ from inside _ by the convex hull of a large uniform sample of points , see e.g. the two seminal papers by rnyi and sulanke @xcite , answering question @xmath4 is radically different when @xmath3 is smooth and when @xmath3 is polygonal",
    ". our results on asymptotic mean values will reflect this dichotomy .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to answer an intrinsic version of question @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , question @xmath4 involves an arbitrary additional point , namely the origin @xmath1 , and in this respect this question is not intrinsic in @xmath3 whereas the following is .",
    "question 3 : _ given a fixed convex body @xmath3 and a poisson point process conditioned on its associated voronoi tessellation to not intersect @xmath3 , what is the geometry of the cell containing @xmath3 as the intensity goes to infinity ? _    the conditioning here corresponds to empty the voronoi flower associated with the nucleus of the cell containing @xmath3 .",
    "we will show that , as the intensity goes to infinity , this nucleus concentrates around a point whose associated flower has the smallest area .",
    "this point is known as the steiner point of @xmath3 . the answers to question 2",
    "can then be used by choosing the steiner point as the origin .",
    "questions 1 and 2 fall naturally within the general literature on the asymptotic description of large cells from random tessellations .",
    "the breakthrough paper @xcite proves and extends the famous conjecture stated by d.  g.  kendall in the 40 s and which asserts that large cells from a stationary and isotropic poisson line tessellation are close to the circular shape .",
    "thereafter , the work @xcite investigates the mean defect area and mean number of vertices of the typical poisson - voronoi cell and of the zero - cell of a stationary and isotropic poisson line tessellation conditioned on containing a disk of radius @xmath6 when @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , @xcite provides an estimate of the hausdorff distance between @xmath3 and its random polyhedral approximation in the slightly different model of a zero - cell from a stationary poisson hyperplane tessellation in any dimension . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there has not been any attempt to prove exact formulae for the means of the main geometric characteristics of a zero - cell of a poisson - voronoi tessellation or poisson hyperplane tessellation around @xmath3 .",
    "the present work extends the results of the aforementioned paper @xcite when the disk is replaced by a general convex body @xmath3 .",
    "the method used in @xcite relies on the application of an inversion map and of the results from @xcite on the asymptotics for random convex hulls in a disk .",
    "it is at first sight specific to the case of the disk , nevertheless we will sketch in section [ sec : rsapproach ] a general method for extending it for a general smooth body .",
    "it seems hopeless to try to extend it to the case of a polygon .",
    "actually , the growth rates that we obtain when @xmath3 is a polygon do not even coincide with the rates from @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have chosen an intrinsic technique which is at the same time more natural and common to the two cases of a smooth convex body and of a polygon .",
    "more precisely , our method involves notably a precise understanding of the geometry of the voronoi flower and its interpretation as a pedal curve , a constrained version of the blaschke - petkantschin change of variables formula , a precise analysis of the process of the support points and a revisited efron s identity . in particular",
    ", all these arguments turn out to be more intricate when @xmath3 is a polygon .",
    "since question @xmath4 is the cornerstone of all the three questions , we first focus on it .      the euclidean plane @xmath8 with origin @xmath1 is endowed with its natural scalar product @xmath9 and the euclidean norm @xmath10 . for any @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we denote by @xmath13 the closed ball centered at @xmath14 and of radius @xmath6 . for two distinct points @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath8",

    "for any @xmath21 , let @xmath22 be a homogeneous poisson point process on @xmath8 with intensity @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , all processes @xmath22 , @xmath21 , may be coupled on the same space by taking @xmath22 as the projection on @xmath8 of @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a homogeneous poisson point process of intensity @xmath5 in @xmath26 .",
    "the so - called poisson - voronoi tessellation is the voronoi tessellation generated by @xmath22 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "its statistical properties are described by its typical cell which represents roughly a _ randomly chosen _",

    "alternatively , @xmath28 is equal in distribution to the voronoi cell of the nucleus @xmath1 associated with the set of nuclei @xmath27 conditional on the event that it contains @xmath3 . in this paper",

    "let us notice that in both theorems , the exponents of @xmath23 coincide but the geometric quantities involved in the constants differ .",
    "in particular , these quantities in rnyi and sulanke s theorem above are intrinsic whereas they depend not only on @xmath3 but also on the origin through the variable @xmath46 present in the integral terms of our results .",
    "moreover , efron s identity @xcite for random convex hulls connects the mean area of @xmath51 to its mean number of vertices , which explains that the integrals over @xmath41 in results ( i ) and ( iii ) of rnyi and sulanke s theorem are the same .",
    "we will show that we have a similar pattern between points ( ii ) and ( iii ) of theorem [ theosmooth ] , as emphasized by proposition [ prop : efron ] . a deeper explanation of the strong interplay between theorem [ theosmooth ] and rnyi and sulanke results will be given in section [ sec : rsapproach ] .",

    "surprisingly , the limiting mean number of vertices in point ( iii ) of theorem [ theopolygon ] does not and even coincides with rnyi and sulanke corresponding result . to the best of our knowledge",

    "we start by introducing in section [ sec : keytools ] the strategy and key tools for proving the announced asymptotic results .",

    "in this section , we rewrite in a tractable way the three expectations which appear in theorems [ theosmooth ] and [ theopolygon ] , i.e. we aim at getting the three relations , and .",
    "we also emphasize the basic ideas and guidelines of the proofs from sections [ sec : smooth ] and [ sec : polygon ] .",

    "we will need to treat separately the case where @xmath3 has a smooth boundary ( lemma [ lem : geom ] ) and the case where @xmath3 is a convex polygon ( lemma [ lem : geompoly1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , lemma [ lem : geom ] will be proved in two different ways .",
    "one of the proofs is based on the cauchy - crofton formula involving the so - called support function of @xmath3 .    for every @xmath80 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath81 the orthonormal basis in direction @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "we will denote by @xmath88 the quantity @xmath89 and we will use indifferently both notations in the sequel , depending on the context . in particular , the distance from @xmath14 to the boundary of @xmath90 in direction @xmath91 is precisely @xmath92 , which implies in turn that @xmath93    the support function also makes it possible to rewrite the defect perimeter as an integral using the well - known cauchy - crofton formula @xmath94    therefore , in order to deal with this expectation we aim to determine the distribution of the point which achieves the support function into a fixed direction ( see propositions [ prop : supportsmooth ] and [ prop : supportpoly ] ) . the strategy will consist in using nontrivial changes of variable according to the case where @xmath3 is smooth or not ( see lemma [ lem : jacob ] ) .",
    "the main difficulty will be in the computation of its jacobian , the determination of the domain of integration for it and finally its integration .    in the next proposition",
    ", we prove a relation in the same spirit as the well - known efron s relation for convex hulls of random inputs , see e.g. @xcite , which connects the mean number of sides of @xmath28 either to the mean defect area of the flower or to the mean defect support function .",

    "the problem now is that we have calculated these two quantities in dimension @xmath4 with a local approximation of @xmath41 by an osculating circle in the smooth case and by a broken line in the polygonal case .",
    "the extension of these methods to higher dimension is unclear .",
    "indeed , a smooth convex body is locally approximated by an ellipsoid , which makes the calculation more delicate . besides , we can not use an affine transformation as for the convex hull model since we need to preserve the euclidean structure .",
    "a similar problem occurs when the rnyi - sulanke approach of section [ sec : rsapproach ] is put to the test . in the polyhedral case",
    ", the situation seems even more tricky .",
    "we expect proposition [ steinerpoint ] to have an analogue for @xmath753 .",
    "only , the steiner point should be replaced by the point @xmath761 where @xmath762 is the volume of the @xmath681-dimensional unit - ball .",
    "finally , lemma [ lem : isaflower1 ] and proposition [ prop : isaflower3 ] can be extended without difficulty .",
    "the limit shape of @xmath640 should be an analogue of the antiorthotomic curve , i.e. the set of points which are equidistant from @xmath1 and @xmath643 .",
    "only , there is little hope to get an explicit decomposition and explicit spherical equations in the spirit of lemma [ lem : isaflower2 ] ( ii ) .",
    "the three main questions of the paper prove to be equally appealing when the poisson - voronoi tessellation is replaced by any random line tessellation in the plane and in particular by the stationary and isotropic poisson line tessellation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this tessellation is obtained by taking a poisson point process @xmath763 of intensity measure @xmath764 in @xmath8 and constructing for every @xmath14 in the point process , the line @xmath765 containing @xmath14 and with normal vector @xmath14 .",
    "the cell containing the origin is the so - called _ crofton cell _ and is defined as the intersection of all closed half - planes containing the origin and delimited by lines @xmath765 .",
    "we denote by @xmath766 a cell distributed as the crofton cell conditional on the event that no line crosses @xmath3 , which is equivalent to say that no point from @xmath763 meets @xmath30 .",
    "we recall that this event has probability @xmath767 this new random polygon @xmath768 satisfies whereas is replaced by @xmath769    moreover , as in the voronoi case , we can establish an exact efron - type identity which connects in a very simple way the mean defect perimeter of @xmath766 to its mean number of vertices . indeed , denoting by @xmath770 the crofton cell associated with the set @xmath771",
    ", we get @xmath772 thanks to fubini theorem , this yields @xmath773    in the smooth case , we can use arguments similar to lemma [ lem : geom ] and proposition [ prop : supportsmooth ] to get @xmath774 this extends to any smooth convex body the results for the defect area and number of vertices obtained in @xcite , see theorem 2 therein , when @xmath3 is a disk .      in 1968 ,",
    "rnyi and sulanke investigated a model close to the crofton cell , save for the fact that they did not use the notion of point process in the whole plane .",
    "instead , they fixed a domain @xmath776 which includes @xmath3 and they considered the polygon containing @xmath3 and delimited by @xmath699 _",
    "random lines _ which intersect @xmath776 without crossing @xmath3 .",
    "this is on a par with the actual crofton cell when the number of lines is poissonized and the set @xmath776 goes to @xmath8 . in this context",
    ", they obtained the mean number of vertices in the smooth and polygonal cases , see stze 4 and 5 in @xcite .",
    "replacing @xmath777 by @xmath23 in their formulas provides the exact same results as ours . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", they did not cover the calculations for the asymptotic mean area and mean perimeter , nor did they establish an efron - type relation .",
    "it comes as no surprise that contrary to the voronoi case , the limiting expectations do not depend on the position of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , by stationarity , the origin has no privileged status among the points of the crofton cell . as a consequence ,",
    "question @xmath72 is the same as question @xmath4 in the context of the crofton cell .",
    "finally , an analogue of question @xmath5 would be : what is the asymptotic shape of the crofton cell conditional on the event that all the projections of the origin onto the lines fall outside of a fixed domain @xmath0 ?",
    "this problem is dependent on the position of the origin and an almost straightforward adaptation of section [ sec : tele ] shows that the limit shape of the crofton cell is twice the antiorthotomic curve associated with the largest voronoi flower with respect to @xmath1 included in @xmath0 .",
    "regarding question @xmath5 , we are interested in the local structure of the cells intersecting @xmath643 , which look like inlets .",
    "indeed , we can observe , for instance on figure [ fig : question1 ] , the variability of the _ depth _ of such cells inside @xmath0 where by depth , we mean the distance to @xmath643 . in particular , we expect the normalized empirical distribution of the depth of all bifurcation points to have a limit .",
    "conversely , there is a hidden branching structure , i.e. a random geometric tree , that can be observed from the origin , for instance in a fixed direction .",
    "being able to describe this tree seems quite stimulating since it should contain information on the domain @xmath0 itself .",
    "for example , the connections occur near the medial axis of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , this question leads to the following natural issue : what is a voronoi tessellation of a poisson point process _ without any point _ inside a domain @xmath0 looking like ?"
