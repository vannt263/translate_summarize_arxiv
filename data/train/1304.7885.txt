    "various experimental results have provided useful hints to explore the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the first hint is the precision measurements of gauge coupling constants at lep @xcite .",
    "those values suggest that the gauge interactions can be unified at a high - energy scale @xmath0 , with the advent of new particles @xcite .",
    "the second one is the discovery of higgs boson at lhc @xcite . from the observed value of mass @xmath1gev",
    ", the quartic self - coupling constant of higgs boson is estimated as @xmath2 , using the mass formula @xmath3 and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of higgs boson @xmath4gev .",
    "the third one is that superpartners have not yet been discovered .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem revisits , in case that the physics beyond the tera scale is relevant to the sm @xcite .",
    "if we require that @xmath5 should be determined without a fine tuning , we have an option that there is a big desert from the tera scale to @xmath0 , and the initial value of @xmath5 is fixed by the physics at @xmath0 ( protected against large radiative corrections by some mechanism or symmetry ) .",
    "hence new charged particles must appear around the tera scale if exist until @xmath0 .",
    "the last one is that a definite discrepancy has not yet been observed between the predictions in the sm ( modified with massive neutrinos ) and experimental results .",
    "this suggests that , in case with new particles , their effects must be canceled or suppressed for some reason .",
    "a clue might be a supersymmetry ( susy ) , which can induce a cancellation between contributions from bosons and those from fermions and control interactions among particles @xcite .",
    "there is a possibility that new massive particles originate from hypermultiplets and a power of susy remains partially and indirectly , although susy is broken down around @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it is interesting to pursue the physics at the tera and unification scale based on the above hints . in this letter",
    ", we specify new particles at the tera scale based on the assumptions that the sm gauge interactions are unified around the gravitational scale with a big desert and new particles come from hypermultiplets .",
    "we propose a theory at the tera scale and beyond , that has a power to determine some coupling constants .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explore new particles at the tera scale , as remnants of gauge unification and susy .",
    "we construct a theory including new particles in section 3 . in the last section ,",
    "we give conclusions and discussions .",
    "we study new particles at the tera scale based on the following assumptions .",
    "one is related to the grand unification .",
    "we assume that the values of gauge coupling constants @xmath6 @xmath7 agree at the gravitational scale @xmath8gev ( @xmath9 is the planck mass ) , and the gauge interactions are unified into a simple group .",
    "then , the normalization of hypercharge is fixed and the gauge coupling constant relating @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gauge coupling constant of @xmath10 in the sm .",
    "the value of unified one @xmath13 is supposed to be less than one , i.e. , the theory is described as a weakly coupled system at @xmath14 , for simplicity .    the other",
    "is related to new particles and susy .",
    "we assume that there exist extra particles with a same gauge quantum numbers of sm fermions and/or its mirror particles around the tera scale , there is a big desert beyond the tera scale until @xmath14 , except for right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath15 ) , and the new colored particles form hypermultiplets as remnants of susy , that is broken down at @xmath14 .",
    "the solutions of renormalization group equations ( rges ) for @xmath6 are expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a renormalization point ( an arbitrary scale in the big desert ) , @xmath19s are coefficients of @xmath20 functions at the one - loop level . in ( [ rgeq - gi ] ) , we replace @xmath21 with @xmath22 , using the unification conditions @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter , we take the @xmath24 gauge boson mass @xmath25 as @xmath18 , for simplicity .    by eliminating @xmath22 ,",
    "the unification conditions are written as @xmath26}{\\ln ( { m}/{m_z})}~,~~ ( i , j=1,2,3)~. \\label{bi - bj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the experimental values @xmath27 we obtain the relations @xmath28    in the presence of new particles , @xmath19s are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a number of family , @xmath31 is a number of higgs doublet , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are numbers of fields ( counting that of a complex scalar field as one ) with representations @xmath37 or @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 and @xmath45 or @xmath46 under @xmath47 , respectively . the number of a weyl fermion is considered as double that of a complex scalar field , and then that of a chiral supermultiplet is considered as triple that of a complex scalar field .",
    "hence , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 should be multiples of 6 , if new colored particles form hypermultiplets .    using ( [ b2-b3 ] )  ( [ b3 ] ) , we derive the relations @xmath48 where we take @xmath49 and @xmath50 according to the sm , and two of ( [ r1 ] )  ( [ r3 ] ) are independent .",
    "if we impose the condition @xmath51 on @xmath52 based on the assumption that @xmath13 is less than one , we obtain the inequalities @xmath53    using ( [ r1 ] )  ( [ ineq ] ) , we obtain _ a unique solution _",
    "@xmath54 where we use values in parenthesis in ( [ r1 ] )  ( [ r3 ] ) , for the sake of convenience , and require that @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 should be multiples of 6 .",
    "the value of unified gauge coupling constant is estimated as @xmath55 .",
    "the uniqueness of ( [ sol ] ) depends on our assumptions , that are backed by not so strong evidence .",
    "another solutions are obtained by changing assumptions partially . here",
    ", we give typical examples .",

    "furthermore , a variety of solutions are obtained if we relax the assumption that new colored particles form hypermultiplets .",
    "for example , there is a solution @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath75 , @xmath60 and @xmath66 with @xmath62 and @xmath68 .",
    "we construct a theory including new particles without specifying its particle contents , to maintain a generality .",
    "the lagrangian density of theory in a big desert is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the sm one and new particles are denoted by @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",

    "note that any yukawa couplings in @xmath83 are not allowed at @xmath0 , though yukawa couplings including gauginos exist in the unbroken phase .",
    "the fixation of coupling constants is due to the fact that the only interactions of hypermultiplets are gauge interactions if @xmath85 susy is respected .",

    "what is the origin of weak scale , i.e. @xmath4gev ?",
    "what is the origin of new particles masses at the tera scale ?    these can be explained by an extension with an extra @xmath116 gauge symmetry ( @xmath117 ) and an sm singlet complex scalar field @xmath118 . in this case , the following terms are added to @xmath86 , @xmath119    by requiring that all hypermultiplets are massless at @xmath0 , ( [ lnewn=2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the gauge coupling constant of @xmath117 , and @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the @xmath117 charges of @xmath88 and @xmath118 , respectively .",

    "after coupling constants are running from @xmath0 with initial values @xmath136 ,",
    "@xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath118 obtains a vev via the coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite , and the @xmath117 is broken down around the tera scale . then , @xmath81 and @xmath78 acquire the mass squared @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath141 takes a negative value with a suitable magnitude around the weak scale , @xmath142 can be broken down to @xmath143 . furthermore if @xmath144s take positive values with suitable magnitudes , @xmath78s have masses of @xmath145tev .",
    "the positivity of @xmath146 requires @xmath147 , and it means that @xmath78s possess @xmath117 charge of the same sign as @xmath123 . in other words , scalar fields with the opposite sign as @xmath123 should be decoupled at @xmath0 , and then hypermultiplets do not survive completely .",
    "it is also interesting to find a model to derive @xmath148gev and @xmath134tev .",
    "we have predicted new particles at the tera scale based on the assumptions that the standard model gauge interactions are unified around the gravitational scale with a big desert and new particles originate from hypermultiplets as remnants of supersymmetry , and have proposed a theoretical framework at the tera scale and beyond , that has predictability .",
    "the candidate of effective ultra - violet theory is a unified theory with @xmath85 susy and conformal invariance . to verify our framework ,",
    "it is necessary to carry out model - dependent analysis and to study its particle spectrum and phenomenology .",
    "chiral superfields based on @xmath149 susy might play an important role . because a higher - dimensional space - time offers the environment that both @xmath85 and @xmath149 susy coexist , there is a prospect that sm particles and new particles originate from susy orbifold grand unified theories @xcite .",
    "hence , if predicted particles were discovered at the near future , there is a possibility that it suggests the reality of three big paradigms in particle physics , i.e. , the grand unification , susy and extra dimensions .",
