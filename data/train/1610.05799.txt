    "blazars are the most common extragalactic objects in the very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath0 100  gev ) @xmath1-ray sky with the current count at 62 .",
    "their emission is characterized by a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with a double - humped structure . under the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) description the lower energy hump is produced by synchrotron emission from a population of leptons , while the higher energy hump is attributed to inverse - compton emission from the interactions of these synchrotron photons with the same population of leptons  @xcite .",
    "based on the location of the peak of the synchrotron emission , blazars are classified into low , intermediate , and high synchrotron peak bl lac objects ( lbl , ibl , and hbl respectively ) . with no apparent cutoff in the synchrotron emission up to 195 kev ,",
    "hess j1943 + 213 belongs to a subclass of hbls with peak locations at > 1 kev energies known as extreme hbls  @xcite .",
    "vhe - detected extreme hbls are rare with only a handful of examples , including 1es 0229 + 200 , 1es 0502 + 675 , and 1es 0347 - 121 .    because of their x - ray and @xmath1-ray spectra",
    ", extreme hbls are thought to have the highest bulk lorentz factors and doppler boosting factors compared to other blazars in the one - zone ssc paradigm .",
    "however , vlbi measurements in the radio have shown low bulk lorentz and doppler factors in these objects , leading to proposals of various multi - component jet models or multiple emission zones ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "extreme blazars are also intriguing within the context of blazar unification efforts  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where extreme hbls are expected to have the weakest jets and the smallest viewing angles .    due to the hard vhe emission , the sharpness of the @xmath1-ray peak , and a stable flux extreme hbls are prime tools for setting lower limits on the strength of intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmf ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the vhe spectra of extreme hbls can be used to study @xmath1-ray propagation effects from measuring the density of the extragalactic background light to exploring exotic mechanisms such as photon oscillations into axion - like particles , lorentz invariance violation , and production of secondary @xmath1-rays from electromagnetic cascades initiated by ultra - high - energy cosmic - rays in extragalactic space .",
    "extreme bl lacs are especially appealing candidates for the latter scenario because of the lack of detected variability over timescales shorter than a month  @xcite .",
    "hess j1943 + 213 is a recent addition to this blazar class after the debate over whether it is a blazar or a galactic source was settled in favor of the former . despite the favored blazar classification from the time of the discovery @xcite , there were initial challenges primarily from 1.6 ghz vlbi observations with evn measuring a brightness temperature too low for an agn @xcite .",
    "the blazar classification was solidified by the combination of the discovery of a potential host galaxy in the near - ir @xcite , a comparative study of the source sed with another extreme hbl @xcite and follow up vlbi observations that measured a brightness temperature within the blazar range , a jet - core structure , and overall radio properties consistent with a blazar classification  @xcite . for a blazar , hess j1943 + 213",

    "the e - merlin observations do not resolve the source , however , and the core spectral index calculation using these observations is affected by emission from the jet - like feature .",

    "km / s is calculated for the transverse velocity of the source at 17 kpc - the assumed distance for a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "this value is significantly low compared to typical galactic pulsar velocities obtained from vlbi proper motion measurements that fall within the 100300 km / s range @xcite and is another piece of evidence against a galactic origin for the source .",
