    "<S> our folding model analysis has shown consistently that the missing monopole strength of the hoyle state is not associated with the uncertainties in the analysis of the scattering , but is most likely due to the short lifetime and weakly bound structure of this state which significantly enhances absorption in the exit channel .    and    </S>",

    "<S> although this state was clearly identified long ago in the inelastic scattering at medium energies @xcite and inelastic electron scattering @xcite as an isoscalar @xmath4 excitation , our knowledge about its unique structure is still far from complete @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the hoyle state lies slightly above the @xmath2-decay threshold of 7.27 mev , its wave function should have a dominant @xmath2 cluster component . </S>",

    "<S> such experiments have been done , e.g. , for inelastic @xmath14he,@xmath15li+@xmath1c scattering @xcite and the data analyses , either in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) or coupled - channel ( cc ) formalism , were performed using the collective model form factor ( ff ) for the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> these analyses indicated that the observed monopole transition strength of the hoyle state exhausts about 7 to 9% of the isoscalar monopole energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the dwba analysis of the inelastic data , measured recently at @xmath16 mev with high precision @xcite , has found that the hoyle state exhausts @xmath17 of the ewsr . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the sum rule fraction @xmath18 of a monopole excitation is determined @xcite as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the excitation energy , nucleon mass and target mass number , respectively , @xmath22 is the mean square radius and @xmath23 is the isoscalar monopole transition moment which is determined by the same eq .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) of the inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> excepting the early work by bauhoff @xcite where a density independent gaussian has been used as @xmath29 interaction in the single - folding calculation , other studies mentioned here have used the well - known ddm3y @xcite interaction in the double - folding calculation of the potentials . since the ddm3y interaction is real , the imaginary parts of both the optical potential ( op ) and inelastic ff were chosen phenomenologically in these studies . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the cc analysis of the scattering by ohkubo and hirabayashi @xcite the imaginary inelastic ff was neglected and parameters of the woods - saxon imaginary op were adjusted separately for each exit channel to obtain a good cc fit to the measured cross sections . although one could achieve a reasonable description of the inelastic scattering data in such a cc analysis , an arbitrary choice of the imaginary potentials makes it difficult to estimate accurately the absolute @xmath4 transition strength . up to now , the @xmath4 strength of the hoyle state has been deduced from the dwba or cc analyses of the inelastic @xmath14he,@xmath15li+@xmath1c scattering @xcite using the breathing mode ( bm ) model @xcite for the nuclear transition density @xmath30 ,   \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the ground - state ( g.s . ) </S>",

    "<S> the inelastic scattering ff is then obtained by ( double ) folding the transition density ( [ e1 ] ) with the effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath34 ) interaction and projectile g.s . </S>",

    "<S> one also uses a simpler approach to ( single ) fold the density ( [ e1 ] ) with an appropriate @xmath2-nucleon ( @xmath29 ) interaction @xcite . in general , </S>",
    "<S> the ( complex ) strength of the @xmath29 or @xmath34 interaction is first adjusted to the best optical model or cc description of elastic scattering and then is used without any further renormalization to calculate the inelastic ff . as a result , the only parameter in the inelastic channel is the deformation parameter @xmath35 which must be determined from the best dwba or cc fit to the inelastic scattering data . since the dilute @xmath2-clustered structure of the hoyle state is different from a monopole compression mode , the use of the bm density ( [ e1 ] ) in the folding model calculation might be questionable . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the uncertainties of the effective @xmath34 or @xmath29 interaction and the optical potential ( op ) in the entrance and exit channels could also cause some deviation in the description of inelastic cross section which results on the missing @xmath4 strength .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the rgm wave functions by kamimura @xcite were proven to give consistently a realistic description of the shell - like structure of the ground state @xmath36 , first excited @xmath37 ( 4.44 mev ) and @xmath38 ( 9.64 mev ) states , and the @xmath2-clustered structure of the @xmath39 ( 7.65 mev ) hoyle state . for the latter , </S>",
    "<S> the rgm wave function has been shown @xcite to be very close to the bec wave function and both of them give , in fact , nearly the same description of the inelastic scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rgm nuclear densities is a very good choice for the present folding model study . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the effective @xmath34 interaction , a density dependent version of the m3y - paris interaction ( dubbed as cdm3y6 interaction @xcite ) is the most often used in our folding calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the cdm3y6 density dependent parameters were carefully adjusted in the hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter @xcite . however , like the ddm3y version , the cdm3y6 interaction is _ real _ and can be used to predict the real op and inelastic ff only . to avoid a phenomenological choice of the imaginary potentials like those used in earlier folding model studies @xcite of the inelastic scattering , we have constructed in the present work a new _ complex _ , density dependent m3y - paris interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the complex density dependence were calibrated against the brueckner hartree - fock ( bhf ) results @xcite for the nucleon op in nuclear matter by jeukenne , lejeune and mahaux ( jlm ) at each considered energy . </S>",

    "<S> one can see from table  [ t2 ] that the @xmath59 coefficient given by the best om fit of the elastic scattering data is slightly above unity which indicates that the new cdjlm interaction is quite a realistic choice for the double - folding calculation of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit @xmath58 of about 1.3 to 1.5 given by the om calculation is not unexpected because the imaginary part of the cdjlm interaction is based on the bhf results for nuclear matter and gives , therefore , only a  volume \" absorption . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary folded op can not properly account for the surface absorption caused by inelastic scattering to the low - lying collective excitations and transfer reactions , and the om fit to the elastic data naturally requires an enhanced @xmath58 coefficient . </S>",

    "<S> such a small sum rule strength is significantly below the empirical range of 15 - 20% of the ewsr discussed above . given an accurate energy dependence of the cdjlm interaction , with its density dependence carefully calibrated against the bhf results at each energy , the rgm and bm transition densities scaled by the same factor of 0.55 give reasonable dwba descriptions of the data at four considered energies . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule strength of the hoyle state found in our dwba analysis is comparable to that ( @xmath17 ) found in the folding + dwba analysis of the inelastic scattering at 240 mev @xcite , where a gaussian has been used for the @xmath29 interaction in the folding calculation of the op and inelastic ff .    </S>",
    "<S> a widely used prescription for the dwba calculation of inelastic hadron scattering is to assume the same complex op for the entrance and exit channels @xcite and the only difference in the elastic waves is a slight shift in kinematics caused by a lower energy in the exit channel . </S>",
    "<S> for such a subtle nuclear state like the hoyle state which has unusually dilute and extended structure @xcite , the diagonal potential @xmath67 should be quite different from @xmath68 which was used as the op in both the entrance and exit channels of the dwba calculation presented above . actually , the importance of using explicitly different op for different exit channels in the cc description of scattering at 104 and 139 mev was pointed out earlier by bauhoff @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one must go beyond dwba and do the cc analysis of inelastic scattering to the hoyle state before making any conclusion on the missing monopole strength . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath69 transition between @xmath39 and @xmath37 states is quite weak and @xmath39 state does _ not _ belong to a two - phonon @xmath70 band , given the importance of @xmath71 transition in the stellar carbon production , we have considered following coupling scheme in our cc calculation @xmath72 in the cc scheme ( [ e7 ] ) , the two - step excitation ( @xmath73 ) of the hoyle state is treated in equal footing with the direct excitation ( @xmath74 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the cc description of the inelastic scattering to @xmath39 state should be more realistic compared to the dwba calculation which takes into account the direct excitation only @xcite . for the inputs of the cc calculation , in addition to three inelastic ff s for transitions between @xmath75 and @xmath39 states , three complex op s have been calculated using the diagonal nuclear densities of these states given by the rgm calculation @xcite and cdjlm interaction ( [ e4 ] ) . for consistency </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath63 factors have been readjusted again to obtain a good cc description of the elastic scattering data , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> while the best - cc - fit @xmath59 factor ( see table  [ t2 ] ) remains more or less the same , @xmath58 factor becomes significantly smaller and closer to unity , especially at the two low energies . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows explicitly how the inelastic channels in the cc scheme ( [ e7 ] ) contribute to the enhanced @xmath58 factor found in the om analysis of elastic scattering . with the increasing energy , </S>",
    "<S> more nonelastic channels are open and the best - cc - fit @xmath60 factor remains around 1.2 to 1.3 at 172.5 and 240 mev . </S>",
    "<S> all the cc results are shown in the right panels of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , and it can be seen that the cc cross sections strongly overestimate the inelastic data for @xmath39 state , in the same way as found in the dwba calculation , when the inelastic ff is obtained with the original rgm transition density @xcite . the two - step excitation ( @xmath73 ) was found to be negligible at all considered energies and the cc cross sections shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] are practically given by the direct ( one - step ) excitation of @xmath39 state only . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the original rgm density for the @xmath76 transition could not reproduce the observed @xmath77 transition probability and we have scaled this transition density , as recommended in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , by a factor of 1.53 to reproduce the experimental transition rate @xmath78@xmath79 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> despite such an enhancement , the folded @xmath76 transition ff gives still a very weak contribution to the cc cross section for the @xmath39 excitation . </S>",
    "<S> an agreement with data can be reached only if the @xmath4 transition density is reduced by about half as found in the dwba analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear now that the missing monopole strength in the inelastic scattering to the hoyle state is _ not _ associated with uncertainties of the dwba or cc analyses , and there should be some physics effect that damps the @xmath4 transition strength . </S>",
    "<S> we further mention a recent folding + cc calculation of inelastic scattering at @xmath80 and 386 mev ( using the same rgm nuclear densities and ddm3y interaction ) by takashina @xcite , where coupling to all the low - lying excited states of @xmath1c as well as 3-@xmath2 breakup channel was taken into account , but the cc cross section for the @xmath39 excitation remains lying significantly higher than the data points , in about the same manner as found in our cc analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> such a  damping \" of the transition strength in inelastic scattering has also been observed in our recent folding model study @xcite of inelastic scattering to the 2@xmath81 and 3@xmath82 states of @xmath83o . </S>",
    "<S> given the electric transition strengths of these states of @xmath83o well determined from the @xmath13 data ( like the hoyle state considered here ) , the dwba or cc description of high - precision inelastic scattering data , which cover a wide angular range and 6 orders of the cross - section magnitude , was possible only if the absorption in the exit channel is significantly increased @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an enhanced absorption was also found for the exit channel of one - neutron transfer 17o15 reaction to the @xmath84 excited state of @xmath85o @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced absorption in the exit channel is a direct consequence of the suppression of nuclear refraction in nonelastic channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a short - lived ( excited ) and loosely bound cluster like @xmath83o@xmath86 or @xmath85o@xmath87 has a shorter mean free path in the nuclear medium which implies a weaker refraction or stronger absorption @xcite in the exit channel compared to the entrance channel where both nuclei are in their ( stable ) ground states ( for detailed discussion see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in a similar scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath39 state of @xmath1c is very weakly bound and particle unstable ( with a mean lifetime @xmath88 s ) and it is natural to expect that the op in the exit channel is more absorbing than the op in the entrance channel . since the elastic @xmath2 scattering on the hoyle state can not be measured , we have adjusted the renormalization factor @xmath58 of the imaginary op of the channel to achieve a reasonable cc description of the inelastic data for @xmath39 state , while keeping @xmath59 factor and complex strength of the transition ff unchanged . from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] one can see that a very good cc description of the inelastic @xmath39 data can be reached by using @xmath89 for the imaginary op in the channel ( see table  [ t2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a strong absorptive op predicts a very different elastic scattering cross section compared to the measured elastic scattering ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] ) .    to illustrate whether the enhanced absorption is also required for some other excited states of @xmath1c or </S>",
    "<S> is it a unique effect associated with fragile structure of the hoyle state , we have done the same folding + dwba ( cc ) analyses of inelastic scattering to the @xmath37 state at 4.44 mev using the rgm density and the results are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f5 ] . like the hoyle state </S>",
    "<S> , the rgm transition density of the @xmath37 state has also been used to successfully reproduce the @xmath13 data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electric transition strength predicted by the rgm transition density is @xmath90@xmath79 which agrees fairly with the measured @xmath77 transition rate of @xmath91@xmath79 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath37 state is a very strong excitation and the measured inelastic cross section becomes even comparable to the elastic scattering cross section at the medium angles where the nuclear scattering dominates ( see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] and [ f5 ] ) . that is the reason why the coupling strength by the @xmath37 excitation is strongest in our cc scheme ( [ e7 ] ) . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f5 ] one can see that a consistent folding model description of the inelastic scattering to the @xmath37 state at @xmath2-energy up to 172.5 mev can be reached only in the cc calculation . </S>",
    "<S> if one stays within the dwba framework , using the same inelastic folded ff , then the total strength of the @xmath69 transition density needs to be enlarged to reproduce the @xmath37 data , but this would lead to a larger discrepancy between the calculated and experimental @xmath92 values . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be seen from table  [ t2 ] that the coupling strength by the @xmath37 excitation exhausts nearly all the surface enhancement of the imaginary op at 104 and 139 mev , and the best - cc - fit @xmath58 factor is around unity compared to that of about 1.3 - 1.4 as given by the om analysis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the measured inelastic scattering cross section for the @xmath37 state is nicely reproduced by the cc calculation at all energies without the need to enhance the imaginary op in the ext channel , i.e. , cc@xmath64 set of the @xmath63 factors in table  [ t2 ] was also used for the exit ext channel . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the enhanced absorption found above for the channel seems to be associated particularly with the fragile structure and short lifetime of the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the @xmath37 state of @xmath1c is more robust and particle stable , and it decays via @xmath93-emission only . with a mean lifetime @xmath94 </S>",
    "<S> s @xcite the @xmath37 state lives about 600 times longer than the hoyle state and 10 times longer than the @xmath37 state of @xmath83o for which the absorption enhancement has been found in the folding model study of inelastic scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although our folding model analysis was done using a new complex density dependent interaction , the absorption enhancement found for the exit channel is not a feature associated with the new interaction . in fact , such a large absorption has already been established in the semi - microscopic cc analysis of the same data by ohkubo and hirabayashi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors have used phenomenological woods - saxon ( ws ) potentials of the same geometry for the imaginary op in all exit channels of the inelastic scattering and adjusted the ws depth each case to reproduce the inelastic data . from table  </S>",
    "<S> i of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one can find that the ws imaginary op for the channel is nearly 4 times deeper than that for the entrance channel , while the best - fit ws depth found for the ext channel is only slightly larger than that of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath38 state of @xmath1c the cc calculation of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has shown also a sizable enhancement of absorption , in an agreement with the results of our cc analysis using the cdjlm interaction which will be presented elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> we note further that small fraction ( @xmath95 ) of the monopole ewsr found in the dwba analyses of inelastic @xmath96he,@xmath15li+@xmath1c scattering to the hoyle state @xcite could well be associated with the same absorption effect as that found in the present work .    </S>",
    "<S> our results of the cc description of inelastic scattering to the hoyle state as well as those of inelastic scattering and one - neutron transfer reaction measured with the system @xcite show clearly that there is a correlation between the weak binding and/or short lifetime of the _ excited _ target - like cluster and the _ absorption _ in the exit channel of a quasi - elastic scattering reaction . </S>",
    "<S> although it is still difficult to establish a systematics for this  absorption \" phenomenon , the results obtained sofar indicate the need to have a realistic choice for the op not only in the entrance but also in the exit channel of the inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the standard method of choosing the same complex op in both the entrance and exit channels of scattering might lead to a large uncertainty in the deduced transition strength if one simply scales the inelastic ff to match the dwba or cc results to the measured angular distributions . in particular , this effect must be accurately taken into account in the study of the scattering measured with unstable beams where nuclei in the entrance and exit channels are very differently bound .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss now briefly the choice for the @xmath4 transition density of the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> it is a common belief that the breathing mode ( bm ) model ( [ e1 ] ) is more appropriate for the transition density of a giant monopole resonance ( in medium and heavy nuclei ) that exhausts a large fraction of the monopole ewsr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the bm density was scaled to reproduce the monopole transition moment given by the rgm density @xcite before being used in our folding calculation , its radial dependence ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f6 ] ) should not contain any feature of the @xmath2 cluster or bec structure of the hoyle state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is quite surprising to see that the bm transition density gives nearly the same dwba and cc descriptions of the inelastic @xmath39 data as those given by the 3-@xmath2 rgm transition density ( see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f6 ] that the two densities have the same asymptotic tail at @xmath97 fm while the node and two extrema of the bm density are shifted inward to smaller radii compared to the rgm density . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , such a difference in the two densities gives only a minor difference in the calculated inelastic scattering cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the success of the bec or rgm nuclear densities in the cc description of inelastic scattering to the @xmath39 state reported sofar @xcite is an important evidence , but _ not _ the unambiguous proof for the @xmath2-condensate structure of the hoyle state . in fact , a closer inspection of the structure models by chernykh _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has revealed that the structure of the hoyle state could be somewhat more complicated than just a condensate of three @xmath2 particles .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> a realistic ( complex ) density dependence was introduced into the m3y - paris interaction , based on the brueckner hartree fock calculation of nuclear matter , for the folding model study of the scattering at @xmath3 to 240 mev . </S>",
    "<S> given an accurate estimation of the bare optical potential , our folding model analysis has shown consistently that there should be an enhancement of absorption in the exit channel due to the short lifetime and weakly bound structure of the hoyle state , which accounts for the  missing \" monopole strength of the hoyle state observed earlier in the dwba analysis of inelastic scattering . </S>"
