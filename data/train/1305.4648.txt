    "two diseases circulating in the same population of hosts can interact in various ways .",
    "one disease can , for instance , impart cross - immunity to the other , meaning that an individual infected with the first disease becomes partially or fully immune to infection with the second  @xcite .",
    "a contrasting case occurs when infection with one disease _",
    "increases _ the chance of infection with a second .",
    "a well - documented example is hiv , which , because of its immunosuppressant effects , increases the chances of infection with a wide variety of additional pathogens .",
    "other examples include syphilis and hsv2 , the presence of either of which can substantially increase the chances of contracting , for example , hiv  @xcite . in a non - disease context ,",
    "similar phenomena also arise in the epidemic - like spread of fashions , fads , or ideas through a population .",
    "there are , for instance , many examples of products whose adoption or purchase depends on the consumer already having adopted or purchased another product .",
    "the purchase of software or apps for computers or phones , for instance , requires that the purchaser already own a suitable computer or phone . in cases where adoption of products spreads virally , by person - to - person recommendation , a `` coinfection '' model of adoption",
    "may then be appropriate .",
    "in this paper we study mathematically the behavior of infections that promote or are promoted by other infections in this way .",
    "we consider a model coinfection system with two diseases , both displaying susceptible  infective  recovered ( sir ) dynamics  @xcite , in which any individual may contract the first disease if exposed to it , but the second disease can be contracted only by an individual previously infected with the first .",
    "this is a simplification of the more general situation in which absence of the first disease decreases the chance of infection with the second but does not eliminate it altogether .",
    "it is , however , a useful simplification , retaining many qualitative features of the more general case , while also allowing us to solve for properties of the model exactly . following previous work on competing pathogens  @xcite",
    ", we assume the spread of our two diseases to be well temporally separated , the first disease passing completely through the population before the second one strikes , although arguments of  @xcite suggest that this assumption could be relaxed without significantly altering the results .",
    "the choice of sir dynamics for our model appears at first to be less appropriate for a disease like hiv , from which sufferers do not normally recover . however , hiv is mainly infective during its primary stage ",
    "the first few weeks of infection ",
    "after which it enters an asymptomatic stage where probability of transmission is much lower  @xcite .",
    "the `` recovered '' state of our model can mimic this behavior quite well , at least for some populations with hiv .",
    "following the description outlined above one can easily write down a fully - mixed compartmental model of our interacting diseases in the style of traditional mathematical epidemiology , but the results are essentially trivial .",
    "the first disease spreads through the population according to ordinary sir dynamics , then the second spreads in the subset of individuals infected by the first , but otherwise again following ordinary sir dynamics .",
    "no qualitatively new behaviors emerge .",
    "real diseases , however , are not fully mixed .",
    "rather , they spread over a network of physical contacts between individuals , whose structure is known to have a substantial impact on patterns of infection  @xcite .",
    "as we will demonstrate , the spread of our two interacting diseases shows a number of interesting behaviors once the presence of such an underlying contact network is taken into account .",
    "we study a network - based model of interacting pathogens spreading through a single population , which we solve exactly using the cavity method of statistical physics . from our solution",
    "we are able to calculate the expected number of individuals infected with each of the two diseases as a function of disease parameters , as well as the epidemic thresholds and complete phase diagram of the system .",
    "our model consists of a network of @xmath0 nodes , representing the individuals in the modeled population , connected in pairs by edges representing their contacts .",
    "the spread of the first disease through the network is represented by an sir process in which all individuals start in the susceptible ( s ) state except for a single individual who is in the infective ( i ) state  the initial carrier of the first disease .",
    "infectives recover after a certain time  @xmath1 , which we take to be constant , but while infective they have a fixed probability  @xmath2 per unit time of passing the disease to their susceptible neighbors .",
    "the probability of the disease being transmitted in a short interval of time  @xmath3 is thus @xmath4 and the probability of it not being transmitted is @xmath5 .",
    "thus the probability of not being transmitted during the entire time interval  @xmath1 is @xmath6 and the total probability of being transmitted , the so - called infectivity or transmissibility  @xmath7 for the first disease , is @xmath8 we will consider this quantity to be an input parameter to our theory .",
    "once the first disease has passed through the population , leaving every member of the population in either the susceptible or the recovered state with no infectives remaining , then the second disease starts to spread , but with the important caveat that it can spread only among those who have previously contracted , and then recovered from , the first disease , a state that we will denote  @xmath9 .",
    "the second disease spreads among these individuals again according to an sir process , and we will explicitly allow for the possibility that the second disease has a different transmissibility  @xmath10 from the first .",
    "note however that the second disease is still transmitted over the same contact network as the first , which can lead to nontrivial correlations between the probabilities of infection with the two diseases .",
    "because the network is assumed the same for both diseases our model is primarily applicable to pairs of diseases having the same mode of transmission  two airborne diseases , for example , or two sexually transmitted diseases .",
    "when the second disease has passed entirely through the system , every member of the population is left in one of three states : susceptible  ( s ) , meaning they have never contracted either disease ; infected by and recovered from the first disease , but uninfected by the second  ( denoted @xmath9 ) ; or infected by and recovered from both diseases  ( @xmath11 ) . note that there are no individuals who contract the second disease but not the first , since the first is a necessary condition for infection with the second .",
    "the number of individuals in the @xmath9 and @xmath11 states tell us the total number who contracted each of the two diseases , and hence the size of the two outbreaks .",
    "as we will see , there is a nontrivial phase diagram describing the variation of these numbers with the transmissibilities  @xmath7 and @xmath10 of the diseases .",
    "to fully define our model we need also to specify the structure of the network of contacts over which the diseases spread .",
    "many choices are possible , including model networks or networks based on empirical data for real contacts . in this paper , we employ one of the most widely used model networks as the substrate for our calculations , the so - called configuration model  @xcite .",
    "the configuration model is a random graph model in which the degrees of nodes  the number of connections they have to other nodes  are free parameters that may be chosen from any distribution .",
    "numerous studies in recent years have shown the degrees of nodes to have a large impact on the structure and behavior of networked systems  @xcite , so a model that does not allow for varying degrees would be missing one of the most important of network properties . in respects other than this , however , the configuration model assumes random connections between nodes , which , it turns out , makes the network simple enough that we can solve exactly for the behavior of our two - disease system upon it .",
    "the configuration model is completely specified by giving the number  @xmath0 of nodes in the model network , which we will assume to be large , and the probability distribution of the degrees .",
    "the latter is parametrized by the fraction  @xmath12 of nodes that have degree  @xmath13 , for @xmath14 .",
    "for instance , one might specify the degrees to have a poisson distribution : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the average degree in the network as a whole .",
    "an alternative way of thinking about  @xmath12 is as the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree  @xmath13 . in our calculations",
    "we will also need to consider randomly chosen edges and ask what the probability is that the node at one end of such an edge has degree  @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that this probability can not in general be equal to  @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , there is no way to follow an edge and reach a node of degree zero , even if degree - zero nodes exist in the network .",
    "so nodes at the end of an edge must have some other distribution of degrees .",
    "in fact , the relevant quantity for the purposes of this paper will be not the degree of the node at the end of an edge , but the degree minus one , which is the number of edges attached to the node other than the edge we followed to reach it .",
    "this number , often called the excess degree , has distribution @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average degree in the network  @xcite .",
    "the quantity  @xmath19 is called the excess degree distribution and both @xmath12 and @xmath19 will play important roles in the developments here .    because they will be useful later ,",
    "we also define probability generating functions for the two distributions : @xmath20 in what follows , we will assume we know the degree distribution  @xmath12 of our network , and hence that we know also the excess degree distribution , from eq .  , and the two generating functions , eq .  .",
    "we can solve exactly for the expected number of individuals infected by our two diseases on configuration model networks with arbitrary degree distributions .",
    "the calculation for the first disease is the simpler of the two , so we start there .",
    "this part of the solution follows closely the outline of our previous presentations in  @xcite .",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] , which depicts the neighborhood of a typical node  @xmath21 somewhere in the network , and let us calculate the average probability  @xmath22 that such a node will ever be infected by disease  1 . to do this",
    "we first consider the probability that a neighbor of  @xmath21 , call it node  @xmath23 , will be infected by disease  1 if @xmath21 is removed from the network .",
    "let us denote this latter probability by  @xmath24 .",
    "( circled ) with either one or both of the two diseases by first calculating the probability that a neighbor  @xmath23 is infected .",
    "we must account separately for cases in which @xmath23 caught the first disease from @xmath21 itself or from another of its neighbors , since these two cases have different implications for the spread of the second disease.,width=151 ]    the removal of node  @xmath21 is a crucial element of our calculation .",
    "some neighbors of  @xmath21 may be infected by @xmath21 itself , but such a neighbor can not then infect  @xmath21 back , since @xmath21 by definition already has the disease .",
    "thus in calculating the probability of @xmath21 s infection we need to discount such processes and count only neighbors of  @xmath21 who were `` externally infected , '' meaning they were infected by one of their neighbors other than  @xmath21 . a simple way to achieve this is to remove @xmath21 entirely from the network .",
    "once @xmath21 is removed from the network , the infection states of @xmath21 s neighbors become statistically independent  the infection of one makes the infection of others no more or less likely .",
    "this is a particular property of configuration model networks in the limit of large network size .",
    "such networks contain closed loops of edges that could in principle induce correlations between the states of nodes , but in the limit of large size the length of these loops diverges and the correlations vanish .",
    "the statistical independence between the neighbors of @xmath21 is the crucial property that makes exact calculations possible for our model .    if we know the value of  @xmath24 , the probability of external infection of a neighboring node of  @xmath21 , then the value of  @xmath22 , the average probability of infection of  @xmath21 itself , is readily calculated as follows .",
    "a neighbor  @xmath23 of node  @xmath21 is infected with probability  @xmath24 and transmits that infection to  @xmath21 with probability equal to the transmissibility  @xmath7 , for an overall probability of infection  @xmath25 .",
    "then the probability of @xmath21 not being infected by  @xmath23 is @xmath26 and the probability of @xmath21 not being infected by any of its neighbors is @xmath27 if it has exactly  @xmath13 neighbors  the statistical independence of the neighbor states means that the probability for all @xmath13 neighbors is just the probability for a single one to the @xmath13th power . now averaging this quantity over the degree distribution  @xmath12",
    ", we find the mean probability that @xmath21 is not infected to be @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the generating function for the degree distribution defined in eq .  .",
    "then the probability that @xmath21 is infected is @xmath30    it remains for us to find the value of  @xmath24 , which we can do by an analogous calculation .",
    "the probability that neighboring node  @xmath23 is not ( externally ) infected takes the form @xmath27 , just as for node  @xmath21 , except that @xmath13 now represents the number of external neighbors of  @xmath23 , neighbors other than  @xmath21 .",
    "this is the number we previously called the excess degree of  @xmath23 , and it is distributed according to the excess degree distribution of eq .  .",
    "averaging over this distribution , the mean probability that @xmath23 ( or any neighbor node ) is not infected is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the generating function for the excess degree distribution .",
    "then the probability that @xmath23 is externally infected is @xmath33    between them , eqs .   and   allow us to solve for the average probability of infection of a node by disease  1 :",
    "we first solve the self - consistent condition   for the value of  @xmath24 , then we substitute the result into   to get the value of  @xmath22",
    ". note , moreover , that if @xmath22 is the probability of infection , then @xmath34 is the expected number of individuals infected with disease  1 , so this calculation also gives us the expected size of the outbreak of disease  1 .",
    "this calculation is an example of a cavity method , a  technique commonly used in statistical physics for the solution of network and lattice problems .",
    "the word `` cavity '' refers to the node  @xmath21 which is removed , leaving a hole or cavity in the network .",
    "the calculation above is a particularly simple example of the cavity method .",
    "the calculation of the spread of the second disease , however , which also makes use of the cavity method , is less simple .",
    "consider then the equivalent calculation for the second disease , in which we calculate the average probability that a node is infected with the second disease , the first disease having already spread through the system . an important point to recognize",
    "is that the subset of nodes through which the second disease spreads , which is the subset that was previously infected with the first disease , does not itself form a configuration model network .",
    "this is made clear for instance by the fact that the subset in question is connected  it forms a single network component  which is not true in general of configuration model networks  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "our cavity method calculation is not the same for disease  2 as it was for disease  1 , being rather more delicate .",
    "in particular , as we will see , the cavity node  @xmath21 must now be removed for some parts of the calculation but not for others .",
    "we will break the calculation down into a number of steps .",
    "first , when disease  1 spreads , node  @xmath21 either gets infected ( with probability @xmath22 given by eq .   above ) or it does not ( with probability @xmath35 ) .",
    "if it is not infected then it can not later be infected with disease  2 , and hence our calculation is finished  we need go no further . in all subsequent steps , therefore , we will assume that @xmath21 has been infected with ( and has then recovered from ) disease  1 , a state that we previously denoted  @xmath9 .",
    "suppose that node  @xmath21 has degree  @xmath13 .",
    "let us ask what the value is of the probability  @xmath36 that it was infected with disease  1 and also has exactly @xmath37 neighbors who were externally infected with disease  1 , meaning that they were infected by any of _ their _ neighbors other than  @xmath21see fig .",

    "that is , when we are precisely at the epidemic threshold for the first disease , the threshold for the second disease is  1 .",
    "we expect @xmath104  to be a monotone decreasing ( or at least non - increasing ) function of increasing  @xmath7 and when @xmath105 we have @xmath115 as shown above .",
    "so we expect @xmath104 to be monotone decreasing in  @xmath7 and @xmath116 at all times .",
    "thus the epidemic threshold for disease  2 is never lower than the epidemic threshold for disease  1 .",
    "the intuitive explanation of this result is that the constraint on disease  2 , that it spread solely among individuals already infected with disease  1 , only ever reduces the set of nodes it can spread on and hence makes it harder , never easier , for the disease to spread .",
    "as a concrete example of the results of the previous sections , consider interacting diseases spreading on a network with a poisson degree distribution as in eq .  .",
    "this distribution presents a particularly simple case , because the excess degree distribution is equal to the ordinary degree distribution @xmath117 and their two generating functions are equal @xmath118 thus  @xmath119 and @xmath24 is a solution of @xmath120 similarly @xmath121 and @xmath54 and  @xmath57 are solutions of eqs .   and  , though neither of the latter equations is very simple .",
    "the epidemic threshold for disease  1 in this case is @xmath122 a well known result for a single disease on a poisson random graph .",
    "the epidemic threshold for the second disease is given by eq .  .",

    "we choose suitable starting values for @xmath24 , @xmath54 and  @xmath57 ( we find @xmath126 to work well ) and iterate the equations to convergence .",
    "figure  [ fig : poisson ] shows the resulting solutions for the sizes @xmath22 and @xmath62 of the two disease outbreaks , as a function of  @xmath7 for a network with average degree @xmath127 and a fixed value of @xmath128 .",
    "when @xmath7 is small we are below the epidemic threshold @xmath129 for the first disease , marked by the first vertical line in the figure , and hence neither disease spreads . above this point",
    "the first disease starts to spread but does not , at least at first , infect enough individuals to allow the spread of the second disease .",
    "the system goes through a another transition , marked by the second vertical line in the figure , when the size of the first outbreak becomes large enough to support an outbreak of the second .",
    "this occurs at the value of  @xmath7 for which eq",
    ".   equals  @xmath10 .",
    ", as a function of the transmissibility  @xmath7 of the first disease .",
    "the transmissibility of the second disease is fixed at @xmath128 .",
    "the solid curves show the analytical solutions , eqs .   and  , while the points show the results of numerical simulations of the model .",
    "each point is an average of simulations on 100 networks of a million nodes each .",
    "error bars are smaller than the points in all cases .",
    "the two vertical dashed lines indicate the positions of the epidemic thresholds for the two diseases , from eqs .   and  .",
    "]    thus , in this scenario , it would be possible to eradicate the second disease by either one of two methods : one could take the traditional approach of reducing its transmissibility  @xmath10 below the threshold value  @xmath104 , or , alternatively , one could reduce the transmissibility of disease  1 until sufficiently few individuals are infected to allow the spread of disease  2 .",
    "also shown in the figure are numerical results from simulations of the model on computer generated networks with the same poisson degree distribution .",
    "as we can see , agreement between the analytic solution and the numerical results is excellent .    .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the parameter values used for fig .",
    "[ fig : poisson].,width=302 ]    using the values of @xmath88 and @xmath104 from eqs .   and",
    "we can also plot a phase diagram for the model , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , showing the regions in the @xmath130 parameter space in which neither , one , or both of the diseases spread .",
    "the horizontal dashed line in the figure represents the parameter values used in fig .",
    "[ fig : poisson ] .    as another example , consider a network with a power - law degree distribution .",
    "as pointed out by pastor - satorras and vespignani  @xcite , the epidemic threshold for a single disease on such a network falls at @xmath131 provided the exponent of the power law is less than  3 .",
    "this means that the disease always produces an epidemic outbreak , no matter how low its transmissibility . from the results above we",
    "can show that the same will be true for both diseases in our two - disease coinfection system .",
    "the first disease behaves exactly as would a single disease spreading on its own , and hence previous results such as those of ref .",
    "@xcite apply and @xmath131 .",
    "alternatively , one can evaluate the generating function @xmath132 and show that @xmath133 in a power - law network and hence , by eq .",
    ", we have @xmath131 .",
    "given that @xmath133 , however , we also see that @xmath134 and @xmath135 in eqs .   and  ,",
    "and hence that @xmath136 in eq .  .",
    "in other words , the second disease will also always spread , no matter how low the transmissibility of either the first or second diseases . in this case",
    "the second disease can not be eradicated by lowering either of the transmission probabilities .",
    "the intuitive explanation of this result is that the subnetwork over which the second disease spreads , which consists of those individuals infected with the first disease , also has a power - law tail to its degree distribution ; the probability of infection with disease  1 increases with node degree and tends to one in the limit of large degree , so that the degree distribution of infected nodes is the same as that of the network as a whole in the large - degree limit . and",
    "it is only the power - law tail that is needed to drive the epidemic threshold to zero  it is not required that the distribution follow a pure power law over its entire domain .    even though both diseases may spread , however , it is not necessarily the case that many individuals are infected . indeed",
    "the number of individuals infected with disease  1 will necessarily go to zero asymptotically as @xmath137 , and hence so also will the number infected with disease  2 ( which can never exceed the number infected with disease  1 ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied a simple model of coinfection with two diseases that spread over the same network of contacts . in this model",
    "one disease can spread freely through the population , limited only by its probability of transmission , but the second disease can infect only those infected with the first . the result is a system displaying two distinct epidemic thresholds , one occurring when the transmission probability of the first disease reaches a high enough value to support an epidemic outbreak , and the second occurring when the first disease infects a large enough fraction of the population to allow spread of the second disease .",
    "thus , while the first disease can ( on a given network ) be controlled only by reducing its probability of transmission , the second can be controlled either by reducing transmission or by reducing the number of individuals infected with the first disease .",
    "we have given an analytic solution for the size of both outbreaks and the position of both thresholds on networks generated using the so - called configuration model , for any choice of the degree distribution .",
    "the solution is exact in the limit of large network size and shows good agreement with numerical simulations for large but finite networks .",
    "we have discussed two specific examples , of a network with a poisson degree distribution and a network with a power - law degree distribution . in the former case",
    "we find a distinct epidemic threshold for the second disease that depends on the transmission probability for the first disease in such a way that the second disease can be controlled or eradicated by reducing either its probability of transition or that of the first disease . in the power - law case , by contrast , we find that the epidemic threshold for both diseases falls at transmission probability zero , so that both will always spread , no matter how low the transmission probabilities are .",
    "a number of questions are unanswered by our analysis .",
    "in particular , we have not addressed any dynamical features of the epidemic process , such as the time - scales or rate of growth of the epidemics .",
    "and we have considered only the case where the two diseases spread at well separated times .",
    "if they were to spread at the same time , it is possible one might see an additional dynamical transition of the kind seen , for example , in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore our model covers only the case in which infection with the first disease is a necessary condition for spread of the second , and not the more general case where the first disease enhances transmission of the second but is not an absolute requirement .",
