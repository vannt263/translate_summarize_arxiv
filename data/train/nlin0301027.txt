    "first steps in the direction of an analytical description were made by faure et al .",
    "@xcite , who gave analytical results for the cumulative distribution of diagonals @xmath0 in rps in the case of chaotic maps and linked the slope of this distribution to the kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "gao and cai @xcite related the distribution @xmath0 to the largest lyapunov exponent and the information dimension .",
    "+ in this paper we give an analytical expression for the distribution of diagonals in rp in the case of stochastic processes and extend the results of @xcite to chaotic flows .",
    "further we compare our approach with the grassberger - procaccia ( g - p ) algorithm @xcite and show some advantages of the rp method estimating some invariants of the dynamics , such as the correlation entropy .",
    "one of the most remarkable differences between our approach and the g - p algorithm , is that we find two different scaling regions for chaotic flows , such as the rssler system , instead of the single one obtained with the g - p algorithm .",
    "this new scaling region can be linked to the geometry of the attractor and defines another characteristic time scale of the system .",

    "then , we exemplify our theoretical results for the rssler system ( sec.[roesslersystem ] ) and present the two different scaling regions that characterize the system .",
    "finally , we propose to estimate main characteristics of nonlinear systems from the rp which extends the importance of the rqa ( sec .",
    "rps were introduced to simply visualize the behavior of trajectories in phase space @xcite .",

    "it is preferable to use the maximum norm .",
    "however the numerical simulations of this paper are based on the euclidian norm to make the results comparable with the literature .",
    "the theoretical results of this paper hold for both choices of the norm . ]",
    "the graphical representation of @xmath7 called recurrence plot is yielded encoding the value one as  black  and zero as  white  point .",
    "a homogeneous plot with mainly single points may indicate a mainly stochastic system .",
    "paling away from the main diagonal may indicate a drift i.e. non - stationarity of the time series .",
    "a main advantage of this method is that it allows to apply it to nonstationary data @xcite .",
    "+ to quantify the structures that are found in rps , the recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) was proposed @xcite .",
    "there are different measures that can be considered in the rqa .",
    "one crucial point for these measures is the distribution of the lengths of the diagonal lines @xmath8 that are found in the plot . in the case of deterministic systems the diagonal lines mean that trajectories in the phase space are close to each other on time scales that correspond to the lengths of the diagonals . in the next sections we show that there is a relationship between @xmath8 and the correlation entropy . on the other hand",
    "we compute the distribution of diagonals for random processes to see that even in this case , there are some diagonals which can lead to pitfalls in the interpretation of the rqa because noise is inevitable in experimental systems . a more detailed discussion of this problem is given in @xcite .",
    "in this section we compute analytically the probability to find a black or recurrence point and the distribution of diagonals of length @xmath9 in the rp in the case of independent noise . the probability to find a recurrence point in the rp",
    "is given by @xmath10 and the probability to find a diagonal of at least length @xmath9 in the rp is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 stands for cumulative .",
    "note that @xmath13 .",
    "+ we consider a random variable @xmath14 with probability density @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that @xmath16 for @xmath2 is a realization of @xmath14 and we are interested in the distribution of the distances of each point to all other points of the time series .",
    "this can be done by computing the convolution of the density @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 is then gained by integrating @xmath20 over @xmath21 $ ] @xmath22 note that @xmath19 is invariant against shuffling of the data . for @xmath23 $ ]",

    "now it is straightforward to compute @xmath28 in the in crps ( in rps only asymptotically ) . as the noise is independent ,",
    "we obtain @xmath29 the probability to find a recurrence point @xmath19 is in both rps and crps independent of the preceeding point on the diagonal ( except in the main diagonal ) .",
    "( [ decaypl ] ) shows that the probability to find a line of length @xmath9 decreases exponentially with @xmath9 . for our example of uniformly distributed noise we get @xmath30 note that in this case the exponential decay depends on @xmath5 .",
    "we present in this section an approach for chaotic systems .",
    "it is an extension of the results presented in @xcite for chaotic maps and also covers general chaotic flows . to estimate the distribution of the diagonals in the rp ,",
    "we start with the correlation integral @xcite @xmath31 note that the definition of @xmath19 coincides with the definition of the correlation integral @xmath32 this fact allows to link the known results about the correlation integral and the structures in rps . + we consider a trajectory @xmath33 in the basin of attraction of an attractor in the @xmath3-dimensional phase space and the state of the system is measured at time intervals @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a partition of the attractor in boxes of size @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath36 denotes the joint probability that @xmath37 is in the box @xmath38 , @xmath39 is in the box @xmath40 , ... , and @xmath41 is in the box @xmath42 .",
    "the order-2 rnyi entropy @xcite is then defined as @xmath43 we can approximate @xmath44 by the probability @xmath45 of finding a sequence of points in boxes of length @xmath5 about @xmath37 , @xmath39 , ... , @xmath41 . assuming that the system is ergodic , which is always the case for chaotic systems as they are mixing , we obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents the probability of being in the box @xmath38 at time @xmath48 , in the box @xmath40 at time @xmath49 , ... and in the box @xmath42 at time @xmath50 .",
    "further we can express @xmath45 by means of the recurrence matrix @xmath51 hence we obtain an estimator for the order-2 rnyi entropy by means of the rp @xmath52 note that @xmath53 is the cumulative distribution of diagonal lines @xmath0 ( eq .  ( [ p_cum ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , if we represent @xmath0 in a logarithmic scale versus @xmath9 we should obtain a straight line with slope @xmath54 for large @xmath9 s .",
    "+ on the other hand , in the g - p algorithm the @xmath9-dimensional correlation integral is defined as @xmath55 grassberger and procaccia @xcite state that due to the exponential divergence of the trajectories , requiring @xmath56 is essentially equivalent to @xmath57 which leads to the ansatz : @xmath58 further they make use of takens embedding theorem @xcite and reconstruct the whole trajectory from @xmath9 measurements of any single coordinate .",
    "hence they consider @xmath59 and use the same ansatz eq .",
    "( [ gpansatz ] ) for @xmath60 .",
    "then , the g - p algorithm obtains an estimator of @xmath61 considering @xmath62 due to the similarity of the rp approach to the g - p one , we state @xmath63 the difference between both approaches is that in @xmath28 we further consider information about @xmath9 vectors , whereas in @xmath64 we have just information about @xmath9 coordinates .",
    "besides this , in the rp approach @xmath9 is a length in the plot , whereas in the g - p algorithm it means the embedding dimension .",
    "as @xmath61 is defined for @xmath65 , the rp approach seems to be more appropriate than the g - p one , as it is always problematic to use very high embedding dimensions @xcite . +",
    "a further advantage of the rp method is that it does not make use of the approximation that eq .",
    "( [ naeherung ] ) is essentially equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ bedin1 ] ) .",
    "the quantity that enters the rps is directly linked to the conditions eq .",
    "( [ bedin1 ] ) and hence uses one approximation less than the g - p method .",
    "+ one open question for both methods is the determination of the scaling regions .",
    "it is somewhat subjective and makes a rigorous error estimation problematic . for the cases considered in this paper we have found that 10,000 data points assure reliable results for both methods .",
    "even 5,000 data points allow for a reasonable estimation , whereas 3,000 data points or less yield very small scaling regions that are difficult to identify . however , the rp method is advantageous for the estimation of @xmath61 as the representation is more direct .",
    "the most important advantage is presented in the next section : rps allow to detect a new scaling region in the rssler attractor that can not be observed with the g - p algorithm .",
    "we analyze the rssler system with standard parameters @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we generate 15,000 data points based on the runge kutta method of fourth order and neglect the first 5,000 .",
    "the integration step is @xmath67 and the sampling rate is @xmath68 .",
    "+ first , we estimate @xmath61 by means of the g - p algorithm .",
    "[ gproessler ] shows the results for the correlation integral in dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "varies from @xmath69 ( top ) to @xmath70 ( bottom ) in steps of @xmath69.[gproessler],scaledwidth=65.0% ]    there is one well - expressed scaling region for each embedding dimension @xmath9 .",
    "then we get from the vertical distances between the lines an estimate of @xmath61 ( fig.[k2gproessler ] ) , @xmath71 .     for the rssler system with the g - p algorithm .",
    "the line is plotted to guide the eye.[k2gproessler],scaledwidth=65.0% ]    next , we calculate the cumulative distribution of the diagonal lines of the rp in dependence on the length of the lines @xmath9 ( fig .  [ rproessler ] ) .",
    "varies logarithmically from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ( bottom to top)[rproessler],scaledwidth=65.0% ]    for large @xmath9 and small @xmath5 the scaling breaks down as there are not enough lines in the rp .",
    "the most remarkable fact in this figure is the existence of two well differentiated scaling regions .",
    "the first one is found for @xmath74 and the second one for @xmath75 .",
    "the existence of two scaling regions is a new and striking point obtained from this analysis and is not observed with the g - p method .",
    "the estimate of @xmath76 from the slope of the first part of the lines is @xmath77 ( fig .  [ slope1roessler ] ) and the one from the second part is @xmath78 ( fig .",

    "+ however , the first part of the curve is interesting too , as it is also independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the region @xmath74 characterizes the short term dynamics of the system up to three cycles around the fix point and corresponds in absolute units to a time of @xmath80 , as we use a sampling rate of @xmath81 .",
    "these three cycles reflect a characteristic period of the system that we will call _ recurrence period _ @xmath82 .",
    "it is different from the dominant `` phase period '' @xmath83 , which is given by the dominant frequency of the power density spectrum .",
    "@xmath82 however , is given by recurrences to the same state in phase space .",
    "recurrences are represented in the plot by vertical ( or horizontal , as the plot is symmetric ) white lines .",
    "such a white line occurs at the coordinates @xmath84 if @xmath85 the trajectory @xmath86 for times @xmath87 is compared to the point @xmath88 .",
    "then the structure given by eq .  [ whiteline ] can be interpreted as follows . at time",
    "@xmath89 the trajectory falls within an @xmath5-box of @xmath88 .",
    "then for @xmath90 it moves outside of the box , until at @xmath91 it recurs to the @xmath5-box of @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the length of the white line is proportional to the time that the trajectory needs to recur close to @xmath88 . + in fig .",
    "[ realrecurrence ] we represent the distribution of white vertical lines in the rp .     and based on 60,000 data points.[realrecurrence],scaledwidth=65.0% ]    the period of about 28 points corresponds to @xmath83 .",
    "however , the highest peak is found at a lag of about 87 points ( the second scaling region begins at @xmath92 ) .",
    "this means that after this time most of the points recur close to their initial state .",
    "this time also defines the recurrence period @xmath82 . for the rssler attractor with standard parameters we find @xmath93 . + for predictions on time scales below the recurrence period , @xmath94 is a better estimate of the prediction horizon than @xmath95 .",
    "this interesting result means that the possibility to predict the next value within an @xmath5-range is in the first part by a factor of more than @xmath69 times worse than it is in the second part , i.e. there exist two time scales that characterize the attractor .",
    "the first slope is greater than the second one because it is more difficult to predict the next step if we have only information about a piece the trajectory for less than the recurrence period .",
    "once we have scanned the trajectory for more than @xmath82 , the predictability increases and the slope of @xmath96 in the logarithmic plot decreases .",
    "hence the first slope , as well as the time scale at which the second slope begins , reveal important characteristics of the attractor .",
    "+ to investigate how the length of the first scaling region depends on the form of the attractor , we have varied the parameter @xmath12 of the rssler system with fixed @xmath97 , so that different types of attractors appear @xcite . especially we have studied the cases @xmath98 , which yields @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , which gives @xmath101 . in both cases",
    "the length of the first scaling region corresponds as expected to @xmath82 .",
    "+ on the other hand , the existence of the two scalings may be linked to the nonhyperbolic nature of the rssler system for this attractor type , because the resulting two time scales have been also recently found by anishchenko et al .",
    "based on a rather subtle method @xcite .",
    "this effect also is detectable in other oscillating nonhyperbolic systems like the lorenz system and will be studied in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "with regard to our theoretical findings in sec .  [ unknown ] we have to assess the quality of the possible results of the rqa .",
    "+ the measures considered in the rqa @xcite are not invariants of the dynamical system , i.e. they usually change under coordinate transformations , and especially , they are in general modified by embedding @xcite . hence , we propose new measures to quantify the structures in the rp , that are invariants of the dynamical system . +",
    "* the first measure * we propose , is the slope of the cumulative distribution of the diagonals for large @xmath9 .",
    "we have seen that it is ( after dividing by @xmath34 ) an estimator of the rnyi entropy of second order @xmath61 , which is a known invariant of the dynamics @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we also can consider the slope of the distribution for small @xmath9 s , as this slope shows a clear scaling region , too .",

    "however , the structure of the curves is qualitatively the same ( it is just shifted to higher values by about @xmath116 ) .",
    "a more exhaustive inspection shows , that the difference is due to the use of the euclidean norm .",
    "the estimate based on the rp method is almost independent of the norm , whereas the estimate based on the g - p algorithm clearly depends on the special choice . if the maximum norm is used ( in g - p and rp )",
