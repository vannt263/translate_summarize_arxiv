    "<S> we extend our earlier model of the small scale structure of cosmic string networks through an improved treatment of the separation of long and short scales . we find that the production of small loops ( at the gravitational radiation scale ) is a robust feature of string networks , in addition to a population of loops near the horizon scale . </S>",

    "<S> even when the properties of the string are specified , so that the problem is completely well - posed , this uncertainty arises from the inability to solve the equations for the evolution of the network . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations have been unable to reach the necessary dynamical ranges of length and time , while analytic methods have difficulty with the nonlinearities of the problem .    </S>",
    "<S> there has recently been progress in both approaches . by using a doubling trick , </S>",
    "<S> recent simulations have been able to reach a much larger dynamical range  @xcite . by focusing on the properties of the network well below the horizon scale </S>",
    "<S> , it has been possible to formulate an analytic model that captures the quantitative properties of the short distance structure  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will argue that these two recent advances point to a common picture .    </S>",
    "<S> the new simulations , taken at face value , show two peaks in the loop production function  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one is at a surprisingly large scale , around a tenth of the horizon length , while the other is near the uv cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the large loops have strong gravitational wave signatures , and so lead to stronger bounds and enhanced prospects for future sensitivity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total length going into loops is fixed by energy conservation , so any string that goes into small loops reduces this effect  @xcite . the simulations at their current dynamic ranges show roughly 90% of the string going into small loops , but the authors of that work conjecture that these loops are transient , so that in final attractor solution essentially all string will go into long loops .    </S>",
    "<S> the analytic model begins by considering the small scale structure on long strings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the string approaches fractal dimension 1 at short distances , with a deviation that goes as a power of the separation @xmath0 , @xmath1 the exponent @xmath2 is determined in terms of the rate of expansion of the universe , @xmath3 and the mean velocity squared @xmath4 in the network , taken from simulations : @xmath5 the relevant values are @xmath6 the predicted two - point function appears to agree with simulations  @xcite . taking this structure as input , we can then calculate the rate at which self - intersections of the long string take place to produce a loop , as a function of loop size . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that , even though the string is becoming straight at short distance , the loop production function ( that is , the rate of loop production weighted by loop length ) diverges at small lengths  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the exponent @xmath2 is rather small in both eras , meaning that the approach to fractal dimension 1 is slow : the critical value for small loop production is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> exceeds the critical value . </S>",
    "<S> this could be an artifact of the finiteness of their dynamic range . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the divergence in the loop production function must be cut off , because the total rate at which string length goes into loops is fixed by energy conservation . in the approach of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this condition saturated at a length scale not too far below the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> it was then argued that smaller loops would be produced by extensive fragmentation , but this appeared to be highly nonlinear and not amenable to analytic calculation . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we make an essential improvement on the previous model , which leads to a very different , and simpler , picture .    on the time scale of small loop formation </S>",
    "<S> , we can ignore the expansion of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the string configuration is described by the left- and right - moving unit tangent vectors @xmath8 the calculation of the loop production rate requires separating the @xmath9 into a long - distance piece and a short - distance piece . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the long - distance part was simply averaged over the unit sphere , with a weight factor chosen to give the correct mean value of @xmath10 . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we will take a long - distance part with some given classical @xmath11-dependence , and then average over the short distance part with a weighting corresponding to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fracdim ] ) . in the end </S>",
    "<S> we should average over an ensemble of long - distance configurations , but the result will be largely independent of this . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the time - dependence will reveal that loop formation leads to a strong correction to the distribution of long - distance configurations , which was not accounted for in the earlier approach  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical configuration is shown in fig .  1 .     written as a fixed long - distance piece ( bold ) plus a random short - distance part . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 increase along the arrows , with the classical cusp defined to lie at @xmath14.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the long - distance configuration is in bold , and the total configuration is dashed . </S>",
    "<S> note that , while the string configuration approaches fractal dimension 1 at short distance , the graph of its tangent has large fractal dimension @xmath15  @xcite .    in the figure , we have shown a long distance configuration in which the curves @xmath16 and @xmath17 cross , meaning that there is a cusp in the spacetime evolution of the string  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the effect of the short distance structure is to turn this one large cusp into many small cusps . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of small loops is closely associated with the cusps . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for a cusp is crossing of the two curves at a point  @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition for self - intersection of the string is @xmath19 when this is satisfied the segment of length @xmath0 , centered at @xmath20 , breaks off as a loop . for small @xmath0 the functions @xmath9 will have small variation along the segment , </S>",
    "<S> so small loops will form where these are approximately equal  @xcite .    following this discussion , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that at early times , when @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 are sufficiently negative , the curves will be outside the cusp region and the production of small loops will be negligible . as the cusp begins to form , production of small loops begins to increase . </S>",
    "<S> we will find that loops of all scales begin to form at the same time , extending all the way down to the gravitational radiation cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> this is in marked contrast to the cascade from large to small loops , anticipated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we are led to conclude that the production of loops down to the gravitational radiation scale is inevitable , and not a transient effect .    </S>",
    "<S> the production of large loops is outside our model , but these also seem inevitable . in the course of the evolution of the network it must happen at least occasionally that a large loop will form and survive reconnection . we must leave it to the simulations to determine the relative weight and average size of these loops , but we can understand why they do not fragment entirely into much smaller loops . from fig .  1 we expect that if there are any cusps on these loops then the regions containing them will dissolve into small loops </S>",
    "<S> . however , if there are parts of the loop where @xmath21 is sufficiently far from the @xmath22 curve , and vice versa , then these will survive . thus we expect that if the functions @xmath9 are plotted , there will be significant gaps in each , corresponding to a large kink , and the surviving curves will avoid each other . </S>",
    "<S> it seems plausible that the total amount of string surviving in the long loops is a small fraction of the total , as seems to be true with the current dynamical range  @xcite , but it is important to study this further .    </S>",
    "<S> the loop production cuts off when the probability for a given bit of string to be incorporated in a loop reaches 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that this occurs long before the classical cusp point @xmath23 is reached . </S>",
    "<S> thus , whereas in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the region where the long - distance parts of @xmath16 and @xmath17 were parallel gave the dominant contribution , but in a correct treatment it is simply absent . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why this earlier treatment gave a normalization for the loop production function that was much too large , though it did seem to find the correct functional form .    </S>",
    "<S> in the remainder of this paper we will carry out the calculation just described . as further support for our picture </S>",
    "<S> , we will obtain a prediction for the small loop production function that fits well with the simulations by two groups . </S>",
    "<S> the fit actually works better than anticipated , as there is no sign that it is distorted by further fragmentation ; we speculate as to why this might be .    </S>",
    "<S> to carry out the calculation of the rate , we separate the left- and right - moving unit tangent vectors into their long- and short - distance parts , @xmath24 since the production of small loops takes place near the cusp , we take the simplest cusp form for the long - distance structure , @xmath25 with @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we are expanding to order @xmath27 , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes @xmath28 have units of inverse length , and are reciprocal to the size of the cusp . </S>",
    "<S> they will be of order the inverse correlation length , somewhat less than the horizon length .    </S>",
    "<S> adding in the short distance structure gives , to the same order , @xmath29 with @xmath30\\ , \\label{2pf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath31 ; here @xmath32 and @xmath33 is simply related to the normalization of the @xmath34 correction in equation  ( [ fracdim ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is approximately equal to @xmath35 during both radiation and matter domination  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a smooth short - distance cutoff at the scale @xmath36  @xcite to take account of the effects of gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the cutoff @xmath37 represents the separation between the long - distance and short - distance parts of the configuration , taken around the correlation length . in the range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 expression  ( [ 2pf ] ) reduces to @xmath39 with @xmath40 ; the @xmath41 dependence is as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    for reconnection probability unity , which we assume , the rate of loop formation is given by the rate of self - intersection , @xmath42 where @xmath43 were defined above and the jacobian is @xmath44 } \\end{array } \\right]\\ .\\ ] ] in our previous work  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we were able to estimate the expectation value of the product  ( [ dn ] ) by the product of expectation values , but here there are strong correlations : when the delta - function is nonzero , the third row of the jacobian is much smaller than its mean value . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore go to new variables , separating @xmath45 into a piece constant on the segment and a piece with zero average on the segment , @xmath46 the variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 depend on the parameters @xmath49 of the loop , but we leave this implicit </S>",
    "<S> . we will be interested in the loop production in the range @xmath50 , so we use the form  ( [ 2pfa ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one then finds the two - point functions @xmath51 where @xmath52    \\label{fsigma}\\ ] ] is defined only for points on the segment , i.e. @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us express the rate in terms of these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> first , for the transverse parts of @xmath43 we have @xmath54 the transverse part of the delta - function sets these equal , @xmath55 , and we use this in evaluating the remaining terms . for the @xmath56 component , @xmath57 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & l - \\frac{1}{2l } { { \\bf l}^\\perp}^2   - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{u - l/2}^{u+l/2 }   du ' \\left [ { \\mbox{\\boldmath$ \\omega$}}_+ ( u ' ) + { \\bf v}_+ ( u ' - u ) \\right]^2 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that the mean value of @xmath58 is zero . in the integrand , </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations of @xmath58 are of order @xmath59 , while the classical term is of order @xmath0 , so we can drop the latter for small loops . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath60 ^ 2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{v - l/2}^{v+l/2 } dv ' \\left [ { \\mbox{\\boldmath$ \\omega$}}_- ( v ' ) \\right]^2 = o(l^{1 + 2\\chi})\\ .\\ ] ] for the transverse part of the first row of @xmath61 , @xmath62 similarly in the second and third rows , in the transverse terms we can replace @xmath9 with @xmath63 , after imposing @xmath64 . in the @xmath56 component of the first row , @xmath65 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad - \\frac{1}{2 } \\bigl ( [ { \\mbox{\\boldmath$ \\omega$}}_+(u+l/2)]^2 - [ { \\mbox{\\boldmath$ \\omega$}}_+(u - l/2)]^2 \\bigr ) + o(l^{1+\\chi})\\ .\\quad \\label{jz1 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term is of order @xmath59 and the second of order @xmath66 , but the first actually drops out . in all three rows of @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> one finds the same pattern , @xmath67 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus the first term in the @xmath56-column is linearly dependent on the other two columns , and drops out in the determinant , leaving @xmath68 with @xmath9 replaced by @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have now expressed the terms multiplying @xmath70 all in terms of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation  ( [ cross ] ) is of order @xmath66 , smaller than the geometric mean @xmath71 of the diagonal correlators  ( [ oo],@xmath72[ww ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore ignore it , giving @xmath73 thus we have achieved our aim of factorizing the expectation value . in the second term the delta - function scales as @xmath74 , inversely to its argument , while the columns of @xmath61 scale as @xmath75 , giving the same overall @xmath76 scaling as in the previous work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this second term is identical to that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was evaluated there with the assumption that the short - distance structure is gaussian , giving a numerical coefficient of @xmath77 in the radiation era and @xmath78 in the matter era . as we will discuss below </S>",
    "<S> , the gaussian approximation may not be valid here , but this does not alter the scaling with @xmath0 .    it remains to evaluate @xmath79 in all , @xmath80 where ( with the gaussian approximation ) @xmath81 in the radiation era and @xmath82 in the matter era . </S>",
    "<S> these constants are actually independent of @xmath33 so the normalization of the two - point function only enters the calculation of loop production through the exponential suppression factor .    </S>",
    "<S> now consider a left - moving point with given @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the total probability per unit @xmath13 that this point be incorporated into a loop is @xmath83 note that we have replaced @xmath84 to count the loops containing the given point . </S>",
    "<S> this diverges at small @xmath0  @xcite , because we have not yet taken into account the smoothing due to gravitational radiation in the two - point function  ( [ 2pf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the smoothed two - point function is quadratic at @xmath85 , corresponding to the form  ( [ 2pfa ] ) at @xmath86 : at the shortest distances the divergence is gone ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we cut the integral off at @xmath87 to get @xmath88 at early times , where @xmath13 is large , the probability of a loop containing @xmath12 is small due to the gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath89 is large compared to the other dimensionful quantities , so as we integrate in @xmath13 we soon reach total probability @xmath90 for a range of values of @xmath12 near the cusp : this portion of the string is removed by loop production ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ excision ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for each value of the @xmath12-coordinate , the maximum value of @xmath13 that may still not be included in a loop is the solution ( when it exists ) of the equation @xmath91 , where @xmath92 we see that the excised region depends on the the angle @xmath93 between @xmath94 and @xmath95 for each cusp , not to mention the ubiquitous @xmath96 . to obtain </S>",
    "<S> the normalization of the loop production function would require the exact knowledge of the probability distribution for the angles @xmath93 as well as the density of cusps . </S>",
    "<S> one can certainly obtain normalizations in accordance with the simulations but there are too many free parameters so the answer is inconclusive .     </S>",
    "<S> is excised in the shaded region of the @xmath20-plane by loop formation . </S>",
    "<S> the cusp occurs at @xmath97 and the curve that delineates the excised region is @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are expressed in units of the cosmological time @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> for this particular example the values @xmath100 and @xmath101 were used , where @xmath93 denotes the angle between @xmath94 and @xmath95 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> these are our main results . </S>",
    "<S> first , loops of all sizes down to the uv cutoff form simultaneously , rather than in a cascade of fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the production of the small loops is a robust physical result . </S>",
    "<S> the integral of the probability  ( [ dpdv ] ) for a point on the string to break off becomes large long before the cusp @xmath102 is reached , so the overcounting in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is explained . </S>",
    "<S> however , this different treatment of the long - distance structure does not affect the short distance part of the rate  ( [ dn ] ) , so the @xmath0-dependence is the same as before .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dist ] shows the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the average value of @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( here @xmath106 is a dimensionless constant : the scaling value of the long string length per unit volume is @xmath107 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations show a power law distribution above the uv cutoff , with exponent that match rather well with our model ( dashed line ) in both the matter and radiation eras .    </S>",
    "<S> -1.8 in     in the radiation era ( upper bold curve ) and matter era ( lower bold curve , reduced by a factor of 10 for clarity ) , from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines show the slope predicted by our model.,title=\"fig : \" ]    -1.5 in    ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also finds power law distributions for @xmath103 , with exponents @xmath108 the simulations  @xcite and  @xcite thus agree quite well with each other , both matching our model well in the matter era and giving a slightly steeper distribution in the radiation era .    </S>",
    "<S> we have found that fragmentation is not necessary to produce the small loops , but it still raises a puzzle . if we were to apply our same calculation to study fragmentation of these small loops , we would find again a strong tendency to fragment into loops at the uv cutoff scale , giving a sharp peak there rather than a power law distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the point is that the short distance structure on these small loops is not that typical of the long strings , but is dominated by two or more large kinks moving in each direction . </S>",
    "<S> one kink in each direction forms with the loop , and the remainder are present in the pre - existing distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have noted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the tails of the small scale structure distribution are not gaussian but are dominated by a single large kink ( again , this does not alter the scaling with @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus these kinks are likely associated with the tail of the loop production function . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the functions @xmath9 on the small loops are dominated by large jumps , from the kinks , and will be unlikely to have cusps where smaller loops can form .    it may be interesting to consider a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis , where the separation between the long - distance and short - distance configurations is taken at a running length scale @xmath109 . here </S>",
    "<S> we just note a few scaling properties . taking the derivative of the two - point function , </S>",
    "<S> one finds that at scale @xmath109 the rate of change of the tangent vectors is of order @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the typical cusp velocities  @xmath111 are increased by this factor , and the size of each cusp correspondingly decreased . at the same time , the lengths of the classical curves @xmath112 are increased by this factor , and so the number of intersections between them increases as @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives another way to understand the loop production functions : it is plausible that the loop production per logarithmic scale @xmath114 scales as the number of cusps with @xmath115 </S>",
    "<S> . this rg approach may be useful for understanding the spatial distribution of loop production , and correlations between loops .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that numerical and analytic methods are converging on a firm picture of the loop production , with one peak near the horizon scale and one near the uv cutoff , with perhaps the larger fraction of string in small loops . in ref .  </S>",
