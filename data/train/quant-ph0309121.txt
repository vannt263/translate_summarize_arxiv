    "<S> the design of efficient quantum circuits is an important issue in quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> it is in general a formidable task to find a highly optimized quantum circuit for a given unitary matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a quantum circuit design method that has the following unique feature : it allows to construct efficient quantum circuits in a systematic way by reusing and combining a set of highly optimized quantum circuits . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the method realizes a quantum circuit for a given unitary matrix by implementing a linear combination of representing matrices of a group , which have known fast quantum circuits . </S>",
    "<S> we motivate and illustrate this method by deriving extremely efficient quantum circuits for the discrete hartley transform and for the fractional fourier transforms . </S>",
    "<S> the sound mathematical basis of this design method allows to give meaningful and natural interpretations of the resulting circuits . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this aspect by giving a natural interpretation of known teleportation circuits .    </S>",
