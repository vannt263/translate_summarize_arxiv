    "this is an update to the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) calibration based on in - orbit observations .",
    "the hetg was described by canizares et al .",
    "( 2005 @xcite ) and previous flight calibration results were reported by marshall et al .",
    "( 2004 @xcite ) .",
    "there are two grating types on the hetg : the high energy gratings ( hegs ) have @xmath22 higher dispersion than the medium energy gratings ( megs ) .",
    "when combined with the detectors , the system is called the hetg spectrometer ( hetgs ) .",
    "a new set of hetg efficiencies was released as part of _ chandra _ caldb v4.4.7 , which was intended to reduce systematic differences between the heg and meg fluxes as well as improve overall model fits .",
    "here is provided details of the steps that went into the release and what is in store for the next update .",
    "updates will also be available at the hetgs calibration web site http://space.mit.edu/asc/calib/hetgcal.html and are presented regularly at meetings of the international astronomical consortium for high energy calibration ( iachec ) ( see http://web.mit.edu/iachec/meetings/index.html ) .",
    "first , data were selected from the tgcat on - line catalog of hetgs spectra .",
    "see http://tgcat.mit.edu to obtain the data used here , which are given in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "i started with sources of all sorts but relied most on extragalactic sources with relatively smooth continua .",
    "a simple type is given : `` bll '' for the bl lac objects ( without strong optical emission lines ) , and `` agn '' for the remaining quasars and seyfert galaxies .",
    "support for this work was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) through the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao ) contract sv3 - 73016 to mit for support of the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) , which is operated by sao for and on behalf of nasa under contract nas8 - 03060 .",

    "<S> the efficiencies of the gratings in the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) were updated using in - flight observations of bright continuum sources . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure first involved verifying that fluxes obtained from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orders match , which checks that the contaminant model and the ccd quantum efficiencies agree . </S>",
    "<S> then the fluxes derived using the high energy gratings ( hegs ) were compared to those derived from the medium energy gratings ( megs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flux ratio was fit to a low order polynomial , which was allocated to the megs above 1 kev or the hegs below 1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant efficiencies were tested by examining fits to blazar spectra . </S>"
