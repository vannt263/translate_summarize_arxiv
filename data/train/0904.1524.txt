    "the main purpose of the lhc is to discover the origin of electro - weak ( ew ) symmetry breaking and any associated new physics at the tev scale .    one clean signal for the lhc would be the discovery of new , higher - mass copies of the standard - model ( sm ) gauge fields .",
    "for such a scenario , the lhc reach in observable masses and couplings is of interest .",
    "there are theoretical motivations for such searches .",
    "many weakly - coupled extensions of the sm gauge group yield new heavy vector fields  @xcite .",
    "such new fields also appear in little higgs models  @xcite .",
    "even strongly - coupled extensions , such as technicolor ( tc ) , predict the existence of towers of heavy spin-1 fields  @xcite .    in tc models ew symmetry",
    "is broken by a condensate , along the lines of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "thus these models do not contain a light elementary higgs particle  . as a result the most promising test of these models at the lhc",
    "is a search for higher - mass spin-1 resonances .",
    "in particular , a copy of the full @xmath2 realized as heavy gauge bosons would be distinctive .",
    "if the new bosons are nearly degenerate in mass then the model will satisfy the precision ew constraints  @xcite , without suppressing the coupling to sm fermions .",
    "this situation would imply that the new boson resonances overlap at the lhc .",
    "once the lhc reaches its design specification , proton - proton collisions will scan over the energy range current data allow higher resonances to occur at . in generic models",
    "this is in the @xmath3 region , but in many concrete realizations the bound is above the @xmath4 range  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the scenario in which a complete set of four spin-1 copies of the sm gauge bosons with heavy degenerate masses are produced in @xmath5 collisions .",
    "we concentrate on detection of the neutral heavy-@xmath0 and heavy-@xmath6 through their decay into muons .",
    "the phenomenology of the degenerate scenario has been largely ignored to date in the literature .",
    "this is in contrast to the single @xmath7 situation , see for example  @xcite and references therein . for simplicity , we model the decay width of these particles by assuming it to be dominated by the decay into sm fermions .",
    "this avoids complications ( and model - dependencies ) arising when including the decay into light scalars and gauge bosons .",
    "if the underlying dynamics is based on an @xmath8 gauge theory with large values of @xmath9 then the boson to boson decays are suppressed by the @xmath9 counting .    at lhc energies the sm background is mostly hadronic ,",
    "so by looking at the neutral sector of higher resonances we exploit the very low background for muon and electron pair production . within these assumptions",
    "we can study the event rate to leading order .",
    "our aim is to identify what portion of parameter space will be testable at the lhc as a function of integrated luminosity and energy .    in the sm ,",
    "a forward - backward asymmetry arises from interference terms between @xmath0 and @xmath6 exchange diagrams .",
    "it is a sizable effect , even in the tev energy range .",
    "measuring such an effect at a hadron collider is onerous but a method and its use at the lhc was surveyed for instance by dittmar  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a deviation of the measured asymmetry from the sm prediction is a possible signature of the presence of a new , very broad resonance with the quantum numbers of a @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast we will study a relativity narrow resonance . in our case , near the pole of some new resonance well into the tev region the number of events is well in excess of the sm .",
    "so much so that the study of the di - lepton invariant - mass distribution will contain a clear peak .",
    "this will be a suitable discovery signature .",
    "furthermore for all practical purposes the sm contribution to this peak can be ignored . in this case , one expects no significant asymmetry to be measurable at the peak from the sm .",
    "if such a narrow peak is discovered in the data , but it results from the existence of a @xmath11 , in addition to the @xmath7 , then the interference between these two new states yields a large asymmetry .",
    "measuring this asymmetry is hence a clean way to identify the presence of two distinct particles in the peak region , with masses so close together that they can not be resolved in the invariant - mass distributions  @xcite .",
    "the organization of our paper is the following .",
    "we begin by introducing a model that encompasses the phenomenology of many specific models of ewsb .",
    "we then summarize some known results about decay widths and cross - sections .",
    "then we proceed to study the drell - yan production of spin-1 resonances at the lhc . to illustrate the dependence of the event rate on model parameters we make a series of approximations to give a simple formula for the total number of events near a peak .",
    "we provide estimates of the discovery reach for two collider energies , 10 and 24 tev .",
    "we then derive a simple formula for computing the reach of forward - backward asymmetry measurement at a collider . at a 10 tev machine",
    "the ability to search for a forward - backward asymmetry , of the type we are interested in , is limited to already excluded parameter space .",
    "therefore we present data at 14 tev ( which is close to the border of feasibility ) and 24 tev . to illustrate the results we finish by concentrating on a particular model .",
    "individual models give relations between the free parameters in our model - independent analysis and restrict the parameter space .",
    "this allows us to evaluate a typical reach scenario .",
    "a few words of explanation about these choices are needed .",
    "the 10 tev centre of mass energy analysis is representative of the lhc experimental program .",
    "as we will see , large integrated luminosities are needed for discovery and hence comparing to the 7 tev  with low luminosity  initial phase of lhc running is not very useful for the cases we study . by 10 tev energy ,",
    "however , the reach is quite substantial .",
    "this is the reason for our conservative choice of energy .",
    "the 24 tev energy analysis is somewhat speculative , but provides a way to gauge how an energy upgrade compares to a luminosity upgrade of the apparatus , in reference to the specific process we study .",
    "this section reviews cross - section and asymmetry calculations as well as defining the notations used throughout the paper .",
    "most of the material in this section is well - known , but it is useful to remind the reader about it , and to fix the notation used in later sections .",
    "we model the new neutral resonances by adding an extra set of @xmath2 gauge fields into the sm electro - weak lagrangian .",
    "we assume that some mechanism spontaneously breaks the @xmath12 gauge symmetry to the sm @xmath13 above the tev scale , and that in the process a copy of the @xmath14 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 acquire a common mass @xmath15 .",
    "in general , the latter is not rigorously correct : the new heavy bosons would acquire different masses in any realization .",
    "however , the idea that the mass splitting is parametrically small is suggested by the precision electro - weak parameters . we will provide a simple illustration of this in the next sub - section . to parametrize the couplings of the new heavy gauge bosons to the sm currents we introduce a parameter @xmath16 .",
    "this is defined so that if the coupling of a given sm boson to a given sm current is @xmath17 then the corresponding new heavy boson has a coupling of @xmath18 to the same current .",
    "for example if the sm @xmath0 coupling to an electron current is @xmath19 then the corresponding new boson , the @xmath7 , would have a coupling of @xmath20 to the electron current .",
    "the common mass @xmath15 and the universal ratio @xmath16 of the couplings are the only new parameters in the model .",
    "it must be noted that in the paper we focus our attention on the neutral vectors only , setting aside the charged @xmath21 .",
    "this choice is due to the fact that for the processes we consider , the kinematics of the leptonic final state can be reconstructed precisely when the intermediate state is neutral , while this is difficult for charged states , in which case one has either to deal with missing energy , or to consider final states with hadronic jets .",
    "as previously noted , in this work we assume that the new heavy gauge fields are degenerate in mass . as an example , illustrating the rationale behind this assumption , we examine the precision parameter @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "recall that on general grounds one can write the precision parameter @xmath22 as @xmath23with @xmath24 the @xmath25 coupling in the sm , @xmath26 and @xmath15 being the decay constant and mass of the vector ( @xmath27 ) and axial ( @xmath28 ) mesons . in models where vector dominance holds the lightest among the states",
    "dominate the sum . denoting them states as the techni-@xmath29 meson and the techni-@xmath30 meson",
    "we truncate the sum to these two states .    under this truncation ,",
    "we write the parameters of these two states in terms of a constant @xmath30 and a mass splitting @xmath31 , @xmath32working with these definitions to leading order in @xmath33 we see that , @xmath34 experimentally , @xmath22 is found to be @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "this requires to implement some mechanism to obtain an acceptable value from eq.([shat ] ) .",
    "choosing @xmath36 would require some sort of fine - tuning , hence we assume that @xmath30 be some generic @xmath37 number . another possibility , that @xmath38 , is realized in qcd .",
    "however , this ratio scales as @xmath9 in the large-@xmath9 limit ( for @xmath9 the number of colors of the confining gauge theory ) .",
    "this makes it an unsuitable mechanism in a large-@xmath9 theory .",
    "also , allowing for @xmath38 to be present would mean that the ( techni-)rho mesons coupling to the fermions is heavily suppressed ( the parameter @xmath16 is very small ) , and its main decay is into longitudinally polarized standard - model vector mesons .",
    "this is in analogy to what happens in qcd where the rho meson decays into pions .",
    "finally , in this case the rho mesons are actually strongly coupled , in the sense that their width is large .",
    "for all of these reasons we prefer not to use this suppression mechanism .",
    "another possibility to satisfy the electro - weak precision constraints is to assume that @xmath39 , small enough that @xmath40 .",
    "interestingly , this observation extends beyond the vector - dominance approximation , at least at large-@xmath9 , in the sense that @xmath22 is suppressed if the mass splitting between new axial and vector meson states is small .",
    "this is the regime which inspires this present work .      in this section",
    "we begin the computation of the relevant cross - section , following standard textbook procedures .",
    "initially this is done for a lepton machine then the results are extended to a hadron machine .",
    "this choice is made to highlight the physics of the model considered .",
    "we find it useful to introduce the function @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total energy , in the centre of mass frame , for the collision whose cross - section we compute , @xmath44 is the mass of the particle @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the decay width of the particle @xmath45 for @xmath47 .",
    "this function enters the propagator of the boson @xmath45 .",
    "note that this requires computing the decay widths for the two new resonances .",
    "the new heavy gauge bosons can also decay into sm gauge boson pairs ( e.g @xmath48 ) .",
    "however the rate of such processes is very model - dependent , and at the same time assuming it to dominate the decay width might imply that the new gauge bosons be strongly coupled , as anticipated . in this study",
    "we assume such channels are negligible .",
    "this is equivalent to setting the 3-point and 4-point meson vertices to zero .",
    "this assumption is justified by the @xmath49 counting if the underlying dynamics is similar to that of a large-@xmath9 gauge theory and the heavy spin-1 states are mesons of the strongly coupled sector , in analogy with the @xmath50 and @xmath30 of a ( large-@xmath9 ) qcd - like theory .    within these assumptions ,",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath7 have decay widths proportional to those of the @xmath6 and @xmath0 in the sm .",
    "the constant of proportionality is the ratio between the sm and new gauge boson couplings .",
    "this is the parameter @xmath16 introduced earlier on . denoting the @xmath51 coupling of the standard model by @xmath24 , the weinberg angle by @xmath52 , the fine structure constant by @xmath53 ( and the new heavy boson mass by @xmath15 ) the decay widths into sm fermions of the new states are , @xmath54 where we summed over all the sm fermions , including the top , neglecting the fermion masses .",
    "typical values of the new heavy masses are @xmath37 tev , thus the error introduced by neglecting fermion masses in the phase - space factors is negligible .    as an illustration of the model ,",
    "we begin by removing the complications of @xmath5 collisions and take the case of @xmath55 .",
    "there are four possible diagrams .",
    "in addition to the sm channels of @xmath6 and @xmath0 exchange there is also @xmath11 and @xmath7 exchange .",
    "following standard notation , introduce @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the vector and axial couplings defined as @xmath58where @xmath59 denotes the electric charge and @xmath60 the third component of weak isospin for the relevant fermion .",
    "we denote @xmath61for @xmath62 and @xmath63 the charges of the initial and final fermions in the feynman diagram . using this notation",
    "the angular @xmath64 partonic cross - section can be written out as , @xmath65 for @xmath66 the angle of inclination with respect to the beam and @xmath67 the solid angle of the scattering process .",
    "the @xmath68 and @xmath69 are defined as , @xmath70where @xmath71 denotes the real part .",
    "similarly we can write the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath72 as @xmath73 we obtain , @xmath74    it is useful to combine the above expressions and rewrite the cross - section in terms of an angular function @xmath75 : @xmath76 with @xmath77this form of the partonic cross - section , in terms of @xmath75 , is the most useful form for our discussion of asymmetry .    above an energy of 500 gev the sm contribution becomes negligible for our purposes , as anticipated in the introduction .",
    "events near the resonance of the new heavy states , @xmath78 , are dominated by the new states as long as @xmath79 , since in this case @xmath80 therefore unless @xmath16 is very small the new resonances will dominate .",
    "the definitions of @xmath81 given can now be approximated by dropping the @xmath41 terms .",
    "@xmath82 we use this approximation to re - write the asymmetry near the new resonance ( @xmath78 ) as @xmath83this approximation is used in computing the numerical values of @xmath72 that we work with later .",
    "this method avoids the complications introduced by accounting for the weak dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath84 .",
    "now we quote the correct formulae in the case of a hadron collider .",
    "the formulae for asymmetry and cross - section at partonic level can be amended by adding a factor for the number of colors @xmath9 , and changing to quark couplings . denoting the quark / lepton couplings with a @xmath85/@xmath86 superscript , @xmath68 is modified to @xmath87 including the appropriate color factor , the partonic cross - section for @xmath88 is @xmath89where the angular dependence has been integrated over . adjusting @xmath69 to account for quarks",
    "gives @xmath90the asymmetry at the partonic level is hence @xmath91    in summary , our study of event rates focuses around the partonic cross - section eq.([eq : cs ] ) .",
    "our asymmetry calculations makes use of the angular partonic cross - section @xmath92the forward - backward asymmetry required in @xmath75 is computed from eq.([eq : as ] ) under the approximation of no sm background .",
    "explicitly this means that @xmath93      we will follow the standard recipe to model processes at a hadron collider .",
    "we consider the incident protons to be composed of partons holding fraction @xmath94 of the total proton momentum @xmath95 .",
    "numerous sets of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) are available through fortran code  @xcite .",
    "for this paper we choose the fermi02 pdf set  @xcite .",
    "for practical purposes , one can treat the proton and its constituent partons as massless .",
    "the two beams of protons each have energy @xmath96 .",

    "the coupling ratio @xmath16 will be allowed to vary between 0 and 1 , where the gauge boson coupling is certainly perturbative .",
    "then the mass range will be taken as lying between 1 and 4 tev .",
    "analysis will also require the assumption that decay widths are small compared to the resonance mass .",
    "inspection of the decay widths , under the limits on @xmath16 and @xmath15 , shows this condition is satisfied .",
    "asymmetry measurements at a hadron collider are made more difficult ( in comparison with a leptonic machine ) by the unknown directions of the initial quark and anti - quark .",
    "however , at high rapidity there is a much greater chance that the quark carries the bulk of the momentum .",
    "thus if data near a resonance in the invariant - mass distribution are cut so that only events with a rapidity @xmath111 greater than some value @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) are used , then there is a corresponding degree of certainty regarding the quark directions .",
    "this method is used and explained more fully by dittmar  @xcite . in summary",
    ", the magnitude of the rapidity controls the probability of misidentification of the quark / anti - quark directions , while the sign of the rapidity represents whether the quark was from the left or right in the collider .",
    "this methodology of inserting cuts , lorentz boosting with the rapidity modulus to the muon centre of mass frame and finally using the sign of @xmath111 to define the angle consistently allows one to infer an asymmetry .",
    "such an asymmetry is the remnant of the partonic asymmetry .",
    "in this section we introduce a set of approximations that are useful in order to study the dependence of observable quantities ( such as number of expected events and forward - backward asymmetry ) on the parameters of the model and on the machine specifications .",
    "the numerical part of the analysis will , however , use the complete equations and pdf distributions without approximations . from the approximations",
    "made we gain insight into how event rates behave as a function of model parameters .    using standard electro - weak relations",
    "the coupling @xmath24 can be written in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath114 .",
    "hence , near the new resonance : @xmath115 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude])-([eq : cs ] ) we can comment on the relative strength of the @xmath11 and @xmath7 contributions to the total cross - section . because @xmath116 , the cross term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs ] ) is suppressed .",
    "also , in the last term of this equation @xmath117 , and hence the contribution of the @xmath118 is a factor of @xmath119 larger than the contribution coming from the @xmath10 .",
    "all of this , together with the fact that the pdf for the up - quark and down - quarks are the most important , and that the coupling of the up quarks to @xmath11 is four times stronger than the coupling of down quarks , means that the most significant contribution to the total event rate is given by the subprocess @xmath120 .",
    "the next largest contribution to the event rate is from the cross term between the new photon and @xmath0-like states ( which is approximately half the value of the leading contribution ) and is responsible for the asymmetry we discuss later .",
    "focusing on the @xmath121-quark pdf , we may attempt to approximate it with some form of expansion . the only relevant dimensionless combinations are @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "as we are looking at the peak we can replace the square mass with @xmath84 so that only one relevant dimensionless combination remains . from the definition of @xmath124 the overall dimension is @xmath125 .",
    "if the mass of the resonance were to increase one would expect the event rate to decrease .",
    "it is also reasonable to think increasing the machine energy @xmath126 will increase the event rate .",
    "we use an approximate form of , @xmath127and consider various @xmath128 so as to obey the above criteria and then numerically fit the constant of proportionality .",
    "the minimal @xmath128 would be @xmath129 to fulfill our expectations for the behavior of @xmath124 .",
    "viewing our expression as the leading term in some expansion a polynomial can be added to increase accuracy .",
    "we find that an acceptable approximation is , @xmath130 provided @xmath131 \\,{\\rm tev}$ ] .",
    "we then go through a numerical fit of the constants @xmath30 and @xmath132 . in the range @xmath133~\\rm{tev}$ ]",
    "just those two terms are needed .",
    "we are interested in the event rate @xmath108 in the peak region @xmath134 approximating @xmath135 with its value at the pole ( which is allowed since the resonances are very narrow ) , and using @xmath136 yields @xmath137 where the sm background from @xmath138 and @xmath0 has been neglected .    finally , the contribution of up - quarks to the total rate is , @xmath139 up to a proportionality constant that contains the electro - weak couplings and the normalization of the pdf distribution .    to correct for the neglected contributions of @xmath140 events and @xmath7 exchange we can consider the ratio of the found rate @xmath141 to a more complete expression involving @xmath142 and @xmath140 events with @xmath11 and @xmath7 exchange . for notational simplicity let us absorb the coupling coefficients into the definition of @xmath41 briefly and write the ratio @xmath143 as , @xmath144    an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxpdf ] ) describes , with different choices of the coefficients , @xmath145 .",
    "then we find that a very good approximation is given by @xmath146for some @xmath147 and @xmath148 that are combinations of the up and down coefficients .",
    "the total event rate can be written , up to an overall constant , as @xmath149 we fix the parameters , @xmath150 plus an overall normalization with the direct numerical computation using the pdfs .",
    "we estimate the error hence introduced between the estimated event rate and the direct computation to be about @xmath151 .",
    "discovery of the new resonance requires detecting a minimum number of events @xmath108 at a machine integrated luminosity @xmath109 .",
    "the approximate event rate can be solved for @xmath16 , given @xmath15 at various machine energies and integrated luminosities , hence producing figs .",
    "[ event10 ] and  [ event24 ] .",
    "these two plots show how the experimental reach changes when improving the energy of a hadron collider , in comparison with increasing only its luminosity .",
    "we conclude this subsection with a couple of examples , to help the reader in interpreting the plots .",
    "suppose one considers @xmath152 events to be necessary for discovery of a new resonance .",
    "setting @xmath152 , if one has data corresponding to a @xmath153 integrated luminosity , then the line @xmath154 fb indicates the minimum coupling @xmath16 required to see such an effect .",
    "in the case of a 10 tev machine , for a new resonance with mass @xmath155 tev , then the minimum @xmath16 is around 0.4 .",

    "we compared different choices of the integrated luminosity and center - of - mass energy of the @xmath5 collisions . for illustration purposes",

    "the uncertainty imparted upon this prediction from the pdfs is quite modest for a high energy collider , while at lower energies , like 10 tev , the pdf uncertainty at large momentum fraction is an important limiting factor .",
    "this is in substantial agreement with the literature .",
