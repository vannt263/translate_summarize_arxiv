    "solving for the non - perturbative properties of quantum field theories  such as qcd  is typically an intractable problem . in order to gain some insights , however ,",
    "a number of lower dimensional models have been proposed as useful laboratories in which to study qcd related phenomena ( for a review see@xcite ) .    in recent times , the role of low dimensional quantum field theories has shifted rather dramatically following the remarkable developments in string/@xmath6 theory .",
    "the present literature on this subject is immense , but a common theme appears to be emerging : there is more interesting physics in yang - mills theory than was once thought reasonably possible .",
    "besides the m(atrix ) model conjecture , which formulates @xmath6 theory in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , there is also a proposal by maldacena @xcite that large @xmath4 super yang - mills theories in various dimensions are related to certain supergravity solutions .",
    "all of these developments suggest that it would be desirable to have a better understanding of the non - perturbative properties of super yang - mills theory at large ( but finite ) @xmath4 , and in any dimension . towards this end , we choose to study in detail the bound state structure and spectrum of a two dimensional field theory , which may be obtained by dimensionally reducing @xmath7 dimensional @xmath0 super yang mills .",
    "such a theory has already been investigated in the @xmath8 ( or planar ) approximation @xcite , and is believed to exhibit the property of screening @xcite . in this work we will allow the number of gauge colors , @xmath4 , to be a finite variable .",
    "this means we will be able to monitor the behavior of the spectrum as @xmath4 is varied and made arbitrarily large .",
    "special attention is given to measuring the precise effects on the spectrum due to @xmath5 contributions in the quantum theory .",
    "although we focus on one particular model in this paper , the techniques we develop here are applicable to _ any _ two dimensional field theory , with or without supersymmetry .",
    "the organization of the paper may be summarized as follows ; in section [ 2dsym ] , we discuss the relevant features of a ( 1,1 ) super yang - mills theory in @xmath2 dimensions , giving explicit expressions for the ( quantized ) light - cone supercharges formulated in the light - cone gauge .",
    "formulation of the dlcq bound - state problem of this theory is the subject of section [ dlcq ] , followed by a detailed analysis of the corresponding numerical bound - state solutions in section [ numerical ] . in section [ conclusions ] , we conclude with a perspective on future applications of non - perturbative finite @xmath4 calculations for arbitrary ( super ) yang - mills theories .",
    "the theory we wish to study is readily obtained by dimensionally reducing @xmath9 @xmath10 super yang - mills to @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the resulting theory has @xmath3 supersymmetry , and can be formulated in the light - cone frame .",
    "the details of this light - cone formulation appears in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for explicit derivations .",
    "we simply note here that the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath11 is given in terms of the supercharge @xmath12 via the supersymmetry relation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 + 2 \\psi \\psi ) \\frac{1 } {      \\partial_- } \\psi \\right\\}. \\label{qminus}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath17 hermitian matrix fields representing the physical boson and fermion degrees of freedom ( respectively ) of the theory , and are remnants of the physical transverse degrees of freedom of the original @xmath7 dimensional theory .",
    "this is a special feature of light - cone quantization in light - cone gauge : all unphysical degrees of freedom present in the original lagrangian may be explicitly eliminated .",
    "there are no ghosts .    for completeness , we write the additional relation @xmath18 for the light - cone momentum @xmath19 , where @xmath20.\\ ] ] the @xmath3 supersymmetry of the model follows from the fact @xmath21 . in order to quantize @xmath22 and @xmath23 on the light - cone",
    ", we first introduce the following expansions at fixed light - cone time @xmath24 : @xmath25 we then specify the commutation relations @xmath26=\\left\\ { b_{ij}(p^+ ) , b^\\dagger_{lk}(q^+)\\right\\}=\\delta ( p^+ -q^+)\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk } \\label{uncomm}\\ ] ] for the gauge group u(@xmath4 ) , or @xmath26=\\left\\",
    "{ b_{ij}(p^+ ) , b^\\dagger_{lk}(q^+)\\right\\}=\\delta ( p^+ -q^+)\\left(\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}- \\frac{1}{n}\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl}\\right ) \\label{suncomm}\\ ] ] for the gauge group su(@xmath4 ) = \\delta^{ab}$ ] , where the @xmath27 s are the generators of the lie algebra of su(@xmath4 ) . ] .    for the bound state eigen - problem @xmath28",
    ", we may restrict to the subspace of states with fixed light - cone momentum @xmath19 , on which @xmath19 is diagonal , and so the bound state problem is reduced to the diagonalization of the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath11 . since @xmath11 is proportional to the square of the supercharge @xmath12 , any eigenstate @xmath29 of @xmath11 with mass squared @xmath30 gives rise to a natural degeneracy in the spectrum because of the supersymmetry algebra  all four states below have the same mass : @xmath31 although this degeneracy is realized in the continuum formulation of the theory , this property will not necessarily survive if we choose to discretize the theory in an arbitrary manner .",
    "however , a nice feature of dlcq is that it does preserve the supersymmetry ( and hence the _ exact _ four - fold degeneracy ) for any resolution . in the context of numerical calculations",
    ", this reduces ( by a factor of four ) the size of the dlcq matrix that needs to be diagonalized .    the explicit expression for @xmath12 , in the momentum representation is now obtained by substituting the quantized field expressions ( [ phiexp ] ) and ( [ psiexp ] ) directly into the definition of the supercharge ( [ qminus ] ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\ & & { 1 \\over 2\\sqrt{k_1 k_3 } } { k_1+k_3 \\over k_2 } [ a_{ik}^\\dagger(k_3 ) a_{kj}(k_1 ) b_{ij}(k_2 ) -a_{ik}^\\dagger(k_1 ) b_{kj}^\\dagger(k_2)a_{ij}(k_3 ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & { 1 \\over 2\\sqrt{k_2 k_3 } } { k_2+k_3 \\over k_1 } [ b_{ik}^\\dagger(k_1 ) a_{kj}^\\dagger(k_2 ) a_{ij}(k_3 ) -a_{ij}^\\dagger(k_3)b_{ik}(k_1 ) a_{kj}(k_2 ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & ( { 1\\over k_1}+{1 \\over",

    "\\frac{}{}\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in ordinary dlcq calculations , one chooses to discretize the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "however it was pointed out in @xcite that supersymmetric theories admit a natural dlcq formulation in terms of discretized supercharges .",
    "this ensures that _ supersymmetry is preserved even in the discretized theory_. before proceeding with the dlcq formulation of the bound state problem , we note that for the gauge group u(@xmath4 ) , massless states appear automatically because of the decoupling of the u(@xmath33 ) and su(@xmath4 ) degrees of freedom that constitute u(@xmath4 ) .",
    "more explicitly , we may introduce the u(1 ) operators @xmath34   \\hspace{4 mm } \\mbox{and }      \\hspace{4 mm } \\beta ( k^+ )   =   \\frac{1}{n}\\mbox{tr } [ b(k^+)],\\ ] ] which allow us to decompose any u(@xmath4 ) operator into a sum of u(1 ) and su(@xmath4 ) operators : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are traceless @xmath17 matrices .",
    "if we now substitute the operators above into the expression for the supercharge ( [ qminus ] ) , we find that all terms involving the u(1 ) factors @xmath38 vanish  only the su(@xmath4 ) operators @xmath39 survive .",
    "i.e. starting with the definition of the u(@xmath4 ) supercharge , we end up with the definition of the su(@xmath4 ) supercharge .",
    "in addition , the ( anti)commutation relations @xmath40 = 0 $ ] and @xmath41 imply that this supercharge acts only on the su(@xmath4 ) creation operators of a fock state - the u(1 ) creation operators only introduce degeneracies in the su(@xmath4 ) spectrum . clearly , since @xmath12 has no u(1 ) contribution , any fock state made up of only u(1 ) creation operators must have zero mass .",
    "the non - trivial problem is therefore solving for su(@xmath4 ) bound states .",
    "in order to implement the dlcq formulation @xcite of the theory , we simply restrict the momenta @xmath42 and @xmath43 appearing in equation ( [ qminus ] ) to the following set of allowed momenta : @xmath44 . note that we omit the zero momentum modes @xcite , which are not expected to affect the massive spectrum . here",
    ", @xmath45 is some arbitrary positive integer , and must be sent to infinity if we wish to recover the continuum formulation of the theory .",
    "the integer @xmath45 is called the _ harmonic resolution _ , and @xmath46 measures the coarseness of our discretization theory , and the integer @xmath4 appearing in the u(@xmath4 ) gauge group for m(atrix ) theory ( namely , they are the same ) @xcite . ] .",
    "physically , @xmath46 represents the smallest unit of longitudinal momentum fraction allowed for each parton .",
    "as soon as we implement the dlcq procedure , which is specified unambiguously by the harmonic resolution @xmath45 , the integrals appearing in the definition of @xmath12 are replaced by finite sums , and the eigen - equation @xmath47 is reduced to a finite matrix problem . for sufficiently small values of @xmath45 ( in this case for @xmath48 ) this eigen - problem may be solved analytically . for values @xmath49",
    ", we may still compute the dlcq supercharge analytically as a function of @xmath4 , but the diagonalization procedure must be performed numerically .",
    "the details of how to construct the dlcq light - cone supercharges in the model studied here appear in reference @xcite .",
    "a similar model was also studied using this approach in @xcite .",
    "the only modification we make here is that we allow the number of gauge colours , @xmath4 , to be a finite ( algebraic ) variable .",
    "this complicates things considerably .",
    "the reason is rather simple . in the @xmath8 formulation",
    ", all fockstates may be written as a _",
    "single _ trace of creation operators , @xmath50|0\\rangle\\ ] ] ( @xmath51 represents either a boson or fermion carrying longitudinal momentum @xmath52 ) , since individual fockstates that involve a product of two or more traces couple to these states like @xmath5 , and are therefore completely decoupled in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "this gives rise to decoupled sectors that are characterized by the number of traces appearing in each fock state .",
    "in addition , color interactions in the light - cone hamiltonian ( or supercharge ) simplify when @xmath8 , since splitting or joining interactions occur between _ adjacent _ color - contracted partons in a fock state .",
    "this dramatically simplifies the representation of any light - cone operator on the hilbert space of single trace fock states .",
    "this property also tremendously simplifies the evaluation of inner products .",
    "it is sometimes helpful to think of a single trace state as a closed string made up of ` string bits ' @xcite .",
    "multiple - trace states are therefore multi - string states , and the string coupling is given by @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath8 , these multi - trace states are just free non - interacting closed ` strings ' . splitting and joining of these strings is only possible when @xmath4 is finite .",
    "of course , as soon as we allow @xmath4 to be finite , we have to give up all of these wonderful simplifications ! in computational terms",
    ", this usually means that the most time consuming part of a dlcq calculation is the evaluation inner products for many parton fock states , which is relatively trivial in the @xmath8 case .",
    "of course , the processing time involved in calculating the representation of the light - cone hamiltonian relative to the discretized fock basis is augmented considerably due to these complications .    nevertheless , we feel justified in dealing with these complications , since a number of interesting physical properties associated with the dynamics of super yang - mills theory are expected to arise as ` @xmath5 effects ' in the quantum theory .",
    "effects for a particular class of super yang - mills theories account for hawking radiation in a corresponding class of space - time geometries @xcite . ]    in practical terms , the complexities cited above simply restrict how large the harmonic resolution , @xmath45 , is allowed to be in numerical computations . in the present study",
    ", we could manage only @xmath53 ( about 2000 states altogether for @xmath54 ) , and we expect that higher values of @xmath45 could be probed if more powerful machines and more efficient code were available .    before proceeding to discuss our numerical results ,",
    "we point out that one may significantly reduce the computational complexity of setting up the dlcq supercharge by taking advantage of the simple fact that the u(@xmath4 ) and su(@xmath4 ) supercharges are equivalent . from a computational point of view , the commutation relations for u(@xmath4 ) matrices ( eqn [ uncomm ] ) are simpler than the su(@xmath4 ) relations ( eqn [ suncomm ] ) , and so it would be desirable to work with the u(@xmath4 ) basis even when we are interested in solving for su(@xmath4 ) bound states .",
    "it turns out that if one constructs a basis of u(@xmath4 ) fock states , and then discards all states that contain a trace of a single parton , then the corresponding spectrum of the u(@xmath4 ) theory on this modified basis yields the same spectrum as the su(@xmath4 ) theory . of course , constructing the u(@xmath4 ) supercharge requires much less computational effort , and we therefore employ this strategy when solving for su(@xmath4 ) bound states when @xmath45 is large .",
    "a more thorough discussion of this technique will appear elsewhere @xcite . of course",
    ", the dlcq program we use can do both su(@xmath4 ) and u(@xmath4 ) independently , and the above procedure can be checked explicitly for @xmath55 ( it works ! ) .",
    "this method is expected to play a crucial role when solving for su(@xmath4 ) bound states in more complicated two dimensional theories .",
    "there are two parameters in the dlcq formulation of the theory ; the harmonic resolution @xmath45 , and the number of gauge colors @xmath4 .",
    "this dependence on @xmath45 is of course an artifact of the light - cone compactification scheme , @xmath56 , and in practice it is eliminated by extrapolating the results at finite @xmath45 to the continuum limit @xmath57 .",
    "reliable extrapolations require careful analysis of the theory as @xmath45 is steadily increased . from equation ( [ qminus ] )",
    ", one sees that the two dimensional yang - mills coupling constant @xmath58 factors out in the definition of the light - cone supercharge , and so the only adjustable coupling constant in the theory is the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity measures the strength of interactions between different trace sectors in the hilbert space , where each sector is characterized by the number of traces in each fock state .",
    "of course , in the limit @xmath8 , these sectors are completely decoupled .",
    "it is therefore an interesting physical problem to investigate the behavior of the theory when @xmath4 is allowed to be finite and large .",
    "bound states will be a superposition of fock states containing any number of traces , but interactions between different sectors will be weak .",
    "our numerical work involved solving the dlcq su(@xmath4 ) bound state equations for @xmath59 , and then extrapolating the results to obtain estimates for continuum bound state masses .",
    "supersymmetry in the dlcq formulation gives rise to an obvious exact two - fold mass degeneracy between bosons and fermions , but there is an additional two - fold degeneracy for each massive boson and fermion bound state .",
    "we therefore have an exact four - fold degeneracy in the spectrum of massive bound states .",
    "figure [ one ] is a summary of the low mass spectrum ( i.e. only eigenvalues less than 30 are plotted ) that were obtained for @xmath60 , and for @xmath61 .",
    "the vertical axis measures the bound state mass squared @xmath62 , in units of @xmath63 .    at resolution @xmath64",
    "there are precisely two massless su(@xmath4 ) bound states ( one boson and one fermion ) , each consisting of two partons . at @xmath65 ,",
    "massive bound states begin to appear in the spectrum , and are four - fold degenerate ( two bosons and two fermions ) .",
    "if these solutions signify the presence of true bound states in the continuum , one expects that their structure will persist as @xmath45 is increased . in order to check this",
    ", one must look at the fock state content of a bound state at different resolutions , and see whether the same approximate structure is preserved as we increase @xmath45 ; whether the wave functions begin to converge or not is an indicator of whether the continuum bound state might be normalizable or not .",
    "of course , as we continue to increase @xmath45 , new states will appear in the ( discretized ) fock space that are not related to any states at smaller resolution .",
    "these will signify the onset of additional bound states that may also be followed as @xmath45 is increased .",
    "the first appearance of a state at a given resolution may be thought of as a `` trail head '' @xcite of the corresponding continuum state . at large @xmath4 , this procedure of finding ` trails of bound states ' is rather straightforward to carry out ( although tedious ) . for intermediate values ",
    "say @xmath61  the fock state content of any bound state is complicated considerably due to the non - trivial mixing between states with differing numbers of traces , and the procedure of following the trail of a bound state at different resolutions must be administered with care .    in figure [ one ]",
    ", we illustrate this procedure for the case @xmath61 , where the dashed lines represent trails of particular bound states , and we have extrapolated these curves to estimate continuum ( @xmath66 ) bound state masses ( we move from right to left on these curves as @xmath45 is increased ) . in general , as we increase the resolution , states pick up additional fock state contributions with a larger number of partons , but the approximate structure seen at lower resolutions is still clearly visible provided @xmath4 is large . in order to determine the trails of these states for intermediate values of @xmath4 , say @xmath61 , we first consider the trail of a state for large @xmath4 ( say @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) , and then tune the value of @xmath4 down to the desired smaller value ; this effects a smooth change in wave function amplitudes , but",
    "the type of fock states in the fock state expansion remains unchanged .",
    "one can therefore be confident that one is tracking the correct state .",
    "there are a number of striking features in the dlcq spectrum of the theory .",
    "firstly , the low energy spectrum appears to be dominated by string - like states ; each time we increase the resolution , a new massive state appears in the spectrum which is lighter than any of the massive states that appeared at a lower resolution .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ one ] .",
    "in addition , the average number of partons in these states increases commensurately with the resolution @xmath45 .",
    "so in the continuum @xmath69 , one can expect the existence of very light bound states that have an arbitrarily large number of partons . since the spectrum is bounded from below ( by supersymmetry )",
    ", one deduces the existence of an accumulation point in the mass spectrum , which we denote by @xmath70 .",
    "bound states with masses at ( or at least sufficiently near ) this point are expected to behave like strings made out of an essentially infinite number of string ` bits ' .",
    "evidently , pair creation of partons seems to be energetically favored .",
    "this behavior directly contrasts what is observed in many other models studied in the same framework @xcite ; namely , the mass of a state generally increases with the average number of partons in its fock state expansion .    one interesting question that we are unable to answer",
    "is whether @xmath70 is zero or not .",
    "we know that massless states do exist at any resolution ( there are in fact @xmath71 of them at the resolution @xmath45 ) , and it might seem reasonable that these light massive states approach the already existing massless states in the limit @xmath69 limit .",
    "we see from figure [ two ] that the prediction for @xmath70 , which is the extrapolation of the points to @xmath66 , appears to be very close to zero , if not exactly zero .",
    "the horizontal axis is specified by @xmath46 , where @xmath45 is the resolution at which the lightest non - zero mass eigenstate first appears ( i.e. has a ` trail head ' ) , and the vertical axis is its extrapolated continuum mass ( i.e. where the extrapolation curves in figure [ one ] intersect the vertical axis ) . due to extrapolation errors , and the low resolutions that were attainable , the uncertainties in figure [ two ] are expected to be quite large",
    ".    another interesting feature of the dlcq spectrum is that the extrapolation curves ( dashed lines in figure [ one ] ) are relatively _ flat_.",
    "this means that by performing a relatively trivial calculation at @xmath65 or @xmath72 , one is able to estimate the continuum bound state mass perhaps within ten percent of the actual continuum value ( assuming no pathologies in the dlcq spectrum for extremely large @xmath45 ) .",
    "of course , for the massless states , the curve _ is _ perfectly flat , and so we obtain exact information about the continuum spectrum ( i.e. that there are massless states ) .",
    "there is an additional curious property about these massless states that appear in the dlcq spectrum .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that any normalizable massless bound state in this theory is a superposition of an infinite number of fock states .",
    "of course , when one works in the dlcq formulation , the number of fock states is finite . in our numerical analysis , however , we observe that the states are exactly massless at _ any _ resolution ; increasing the resolution increases the complexity of the fock state expansions of these massless states , but the masses are always precisely zero .",
    "some very special cancellations are evidently responsible for protecting these massless states from receiving corrections due to the change in resolution .",
    "note that this is suggestive of some kind of ` duality ' ; namely , for @xmath45 small , the problem is relatively easy to solve , and has a simple description in terms of a small number of degrees of freedom , while for @xmath69 , the complexity of the dlcq problem increases dramatically , and the precise description of corresponding bound states is in terms of many more degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , the masses of certain states are preserved .",
    "it would be interesting to understand this from another point of view .    since @xmath4 is an algebraic variable in our calculations , we are able to investigate the changes in the masses of states as @xmath4 is varied .",
    "as an illustration , we consider the mass of a state which has a `` trail head '' mass of @xmath73",
    ". see figure [ three ] .",
    "the values of @xmath4 are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath68 , and we consider the range @xmath60 as usual .    evidently , for @xmath78 , the coupling @xmath5 is no longer negligible , and there is an apparent shift in the estimated continuum mass of the bound state . for @xmath79 , convergence to",
    "the large @xmath4 limit appears to be rather rapid .",
    "the general behavior at large @xmath4 would be consistent with the interpretation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are positive constants .",
    "we do not have a term linear in @xmath5 since one can show directly that @xmath83 is even under the interchange , and so we may analytically continue @xmath4 to non - integer or negative integer values by direct substitution ! ] @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath78 , it is clear from figure [ three ] that this picture is no longer valid , and one would expect relevant contributions at higher order in the @xmath5 expansion for @xmath30 .",
    "the multi - particle spectrum is a feature of the dlcq spectrum that has only recently become of interest .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that there may be bound states in the dlcq spectrum at resolution @xmath45 which may be thought of as two non - interacting bound states ; this was verified by determining the masses @xmath85 and @xmath86 of bound states at resolutions @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively ( @xmath88 is positive integral ) , and showing that the light - cone energy relation for two free particles , @xmath89 was obeyed .",
    "it is perhaps surprising the such a spectrum was found in @xcite , since the calculation was performed for @xmath8 , where the hilbert space consists of fock states that are only _ single _ traces of parton creation operators .",
    "there is no obvious way of identifying single or multi - particle states in such a basis . in the case of finite but very large @xmath4",
    ", it is easy to see how the spectrum approaches a many body continua ; the basis now consists of multi - trace states , but interactions between bound states consisting of predominantly single trace fock states are suppressed by @xmath5 .",
    "two body continua in the spectrum is therefore obvious in our finite analysis , and we will discuss this in more detail shortly .",
    "nevertheless , it is tempting to speculate on a possible explanation for the presence of these `` multi - particle '' states in the @xmath8 analysis ; namely , following the work @xcite , one expects even at very large ( but finite ) @xmath4 that any predominantly two trace bound state has a contribution from single trace fock states .",
    "one sees this directly in the dlcq analysis , of course .",
    "this suggests that it might be possible to `` see '' multi - trace bound states in the @xmath8 spectrum ( where there are no multi - trace states in the hilbert space ) by virtue of the surviving single trace contributions .",
    "a more thorough numerical investigation will need to be carried out before this question can be properly resolved , since the above argument rests heavily on the dynamical properties of the theory .",
    "we now return to the issue of multi - particle bound states in the context of our finite @xmath4 calculations .",
    "for very large values of @xmath4 , it is straightforward to identify in the bound state spectrum those states that are essentially two loosely bound particles ; namely , any bound state that is predominantly a superposition of two - trace fock states are obvious candidates .",
    "of course , one needs to verify relation ( [ twobodymass ] ) before concluding that the bound state admits such a ` two free - particle ' interpretation .",
    "a representation of such calculations is given in figure [ four ] .",
    "after solving the dlcq bound state equations for different resolutions , we are able to identify a predominantly single trace bound state with three partons in the trace .",
    "the extrapolated continuum mass is estimated by the solid curve in figure [ four ] .",
    "one also discerns many massless states consisting of two partons . at resolution @xmath90 ,",
    "one finds a bound state consisting of two trace fock states that is readily identified as the two bound states mentioned above that are essentially non - interacting .",
    "its mass is predicted exactly by equation ( [ twobodymass ] ) . at resolution",
    "@xmath91 , there are two ways to form the state and at resolutions @xmath92 and @xmath54 there are three and four ways respectively to form the state ( see figure [ four ] ) .",
    "we find all these states have a mass that is predicted by ( [ twobodymass ] ) to very high precision .",
    "what we are seeing is therefore the discrete realization of the two body continuum spectrum .",
    "we have made a best fit to the lowest two - body mass at each resolution , and we see that the extrapolated value coincides ( within error ) with the mass of the three parton massive bound state .",
    "this is of course expected , since the mass at threshold of a massive and massless state is precisely the mass of the massive state . in the dlcq calculation , one finds that the masses of these two body states are highly degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy of the massive state is @xmath72 , while the degeneracy of the massless states is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the resolution of the two parton massless states appearing in the two - trace states .",
    "the total degeneracy is therefore expected to be @xmath95 , which is indeed observed in the spectrum .",
    "as we increase the resolution the density of points will increase and effectively fill the continuum as a dense subset .",
    "what we have presented is an illustrative example , and we in fact find the same pattern for other combinations of states as well , including three body spectra , which all occur at the expected mass .    of course , the above observations are expected as trivial realizations of the @xmath5 expansion . what is of interest is the modifications in the spectrum due to small but measurable contributions if we allow @xmath5 interactions to become important . as we mentioned earlier , studying the trail lines ( i.e. tracking a particular state at different resolutions as in figure [ one ] )",
    "becomes increasingly difficult if @xmath4 is not very large . to assist one in establishing the correct trail lines , it is helpful to first consider identifying states at large @xmath4 ( say n=1000 ) , and then following the state as @xmath4 is lowered to the desired value . in figure",
    "[ five ] we perform this procedure , starting with the two body spectrum represented in figure [ four ] ( where @xmath96 ) , and then eventually arriving at the spectrum for @xmath61 .",
    "the obvious difference between figure [ four ] and figure [ five ] is that at @xmath61 , the mass splittings in the spectrum become discernible .",
    "note that there is a discontinuous change in the number of degrees of freedom at @xmath8 , since at this point , the bound states at large but finite @xmath4 will dissociate into their constituent particles at @xmath8 .",
    "the presence of multi - particle bound states for finite @xmath4 evidently provides scope for an exponential growth in the density of states .",
    "the points in figure [ five ] are the values predicted by equation ( [ twobodymass ] ) at @xmath97 .",
    "most of the states are below the threshold indicating that at @xmath97 the interaction that mixes the various trace sectors is attractive and we consider these states to be bound states .",
    "some of the states are above the threshold implying that they are candidate continuum states .",
    "the mass splittings introduced by @xmath5 interactions may push states above and/or below threshold , depending on the details of the interactions , and so determining the number of bound states in a theory at finite @xmath4 is a highly non - trivial dynamical question .    at this point",
    ", we remark that the additional interactions we introduce as a result of working with finite @xmath4 is suggestive of a system of weakly interacting hadrons ; the case @xmath8 is analogous to a system of non - interacting colorless bound states , while the @xmath5 effects introduce the many subtle interactions that arise between colorless hadrons .",
    "to summarize , we find that the low energy spectrum of @xmath3 su(@xmath4 ) super yang - mills in @xmath2 dimensions is dominated by string - like states .",
    "this followed from the observation that increasing the dlcq resolution introduces new lighter states that have on average more partons in their fock state expansion than states at smaller resolutions .",
    "there is also strong numerical evidence that these states are normalizable , since one can keep track of these solutions as the resolution is increased , and we find that the fock state amplitudes converge rapidly ( see figure [ one ] ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that pair creation of partons in this theory is not energetically suppressed .",
    "string - like states were also found in a theory involving complex adjoint fermions , although their fock state content was much simpler @xcite    this immediately raises a question about the detailed structure of the spectrum . from supersymmetry , masses are bounded from below , and we therefore infer the existence of an accumulation point in the spectrum . near this point , bound states consist of an arbitrarily large number of partons . whether this accumulation point occurs at zero or positive mass was partly addressed in figure [ two ] , and this still remains an open question . nevertheless , these results suggest that the fundamental degrees of freedom in the theory ( i.e. the normalizable bound states ) may give rise to a continuous spectrum starting at ( or close to ) zero mass . whether this is the signature of an additional hidden dimension , as was discussed in @xcite in the context of the non - critical superstring in @xmath7 dimensions , or",
    "the manifestation of screening @xcite , is still unclear .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the model exhibits remarkably complicated low energy dynamics .",
    "one of the main goals of this work was to go beyond the @xmath8 ( or planar ) approximation of gauge theories in order to study @xmath5 effects ( e.g see figure [ three ] ) . in the present context , the quantity @xmath5 plays the role of a coupling constant , and measures the strength of interactions between sectors in the hilbert space that are characterized by the number of colorless traces in each fock state . for @xmath4 large ( but finite )",
    ", it is easy to identify two ` loosely bound ' particles in the spectrum , since it will be made up of predominantly two trace fock states .",
    "we showed that the same strategy adopted in @xcite to calculate the mass of two freely interacting bound states in the dlcq spectrum applies equally well in the present context .",
    "figure [ four ] illustrates the manifestation of such ` two body ' continua in the dlcq spectrum .    for intermediate values of @xmath4 , it is possible to measure the effects of @xmath5 interactions , and we have presented an illustration of the mass splittings that occur in figure [ five ] .",
    "it is a dynamical question whether an attractive force will develop between particles that freely interact in the @xmath8 limit .",
    "evidently , the formation of bound states is favored in the present model , and we are therefore faced with the interesting problem of counting the asymptotic degeneracies in the spectrum if @xmath4 is made arbitrarily large ( but finite ) .",
    "we were unable to address this question here .",
    "note that the presence of very light string - like states suggests that the quantity @xmath5 plays the role of a string coupling constant @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to pursue these ideas further in the context of a two dimensional super yang - mills realization of the ten dimensional critical string @xcite .",
    "finally , it has become evident recently that the properties of low dimensional super yang - mills may provide a non - perturbative formulation of quantum theories with gravity .",
    "it would be interesting to explore this connection further by performing the sort of non - perturbative analyses presented here .",
