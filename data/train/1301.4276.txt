    "deep phylogeographic structure based on mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , and confirmed by multilocus nuclear dna ( ndna ) , is increasingly used as an initial step in species delimitation via integrative taxonomy @xcite . as we grow better able to identify evolutionarily independent genetic lineages within morphologically - defined species ,",
    "what is often missing is both an understanding of the forces leading to this diversity and evaluation of whether these lineages are more than ephemera @xcite .",
    "one way to start addressing these questions is to test for reproductive isolation ( ri ) among such morphologically cryptic lineages .",
    "is there substantial ri between cryptic lineages , and how does this scale with divergence time and historical gene flow ? answers to this question will inform modern systematics and contribute to our understanding of speciation processes .",
    "it has long been supposed that phylogeographic lineages represent a step in the continuum from population divergence to speciation @xcite .",
    "more generally , speciation theory posits that ri , especially post - zygotic ri , increases with divergence time , with the tempo and form of the relationship depending on the genetic architecture of dobzhansky - muller incompatibilities ( dmis ) and the interaction of selection , drift , and gene flow @xcite .",
    "but , given this , the heterogeneity of divergent selection is expected to blur the relationship between ri and divergence @xcite . a growing body of evidence supports a general increase in ri with divergence time ; however , with few exceptions @xcite , these results derive from analyses of phenotypically distinct species pairs @xcite . as phylogeographic lineages within morphologically defined species",
    "are often parapatrically distributed , comparative analyses of ri indices in secondary contact zones could provide a unique window into the dynamics of eco - phenotypically cryptic speciation @xcite .",
    "such studies have the added advantage of addressing the evolution of ri in nature , in the organisms ecological context , rather than laboratory crosses , as is more common in the literature .",
    "to investigate the evolution of ri in nature , we exploit a system characterized by climate - driven fluctuations in habitat extent and connectivity during the neogene  the rainforests of the australian wet tropics ( awt ; fig .",
    "1 ) . extended periods of retraction of rainforests to mesic mountain tops has resulted in pronounced phylogeographic structure within endemic faunal species , but with variable levels of sequence divergence and divergence time among intraspecific lineages @xcite .",
    "where tested , these mtdna lineages are generally corroborated by multilocus nuclear gene analysis @xcite ( but see @xcite ) ; however , eco - morphological divergence is subtle or absent @xcite .",
    "following holocene rainforest expansions , over twenty contact zones involving pairs of morphologically cryptic lineages formed between the historic refugia @xcite .",
    "these contact zones provide a natural experiment with which to test the hypothesis that ri increases with divergence time among cryptic lineages .",
    "previous studies of contact zones have revealed outcomes ranging from negligible to strong ri @xcite , including one case of speciation by reinforcement @xcite .",
    "however , the cases studied to date are taxonomically and ecologically heterogeneous .    here",
    ", we use comparative analysis of ri within five contact zones involving lineage - pairs from a closely - related and ecologically - similar clade of terrestrial rainforest skinks , across which there are varying levels of sequence divergence among component clades : ( _ carlia rubrigularis _",
    "n / s , _ lampropholis coggeri _",
    "n / c , _ l. coggeri _",
    "c / s , _ saproscincus basiliscus _",
    "n / c , and _",
    "s. basiliscus _ n/_s .",
    "lewisi _ ; fig .",
    "1 ) . we combine genome - scale analyses of divergence history between allopatric populations with multilocus analysis of intensively sampled contact zones to test for increasing ri with divergence time .",
    "we assume that per - generation dispersal rates are similar across lineages , which indirect dispersal estimates from this clade support @xcite . because the focal lineages are ecologically - similar , rainforest - edge species that likely tracked the expanding rainforest front closely @xcite",
    ", we further assume that the contact zones formed concurrently .",
    "following from these assumptions , we predict that ri scales closely with divergence , especially given the limited ecomorphological divergence of these lineage - pairs @xcite and , for at least one lineage - pair , apparent absence of mate choice @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we predict that , as divergence time increases , cline widths should narrow , clines should exhibit less variance in cline width , disequilibrium  both within- and between - loci  should increase , and frequency of hybrids within the hybrid zone should decrease @xcite .",
    "we used morphological data , including ecologically relevant traits such as body size , limb length and head dimensions , to test for phenotypic divergence across the major phylogeographic lineages within each traditionally defined species ( mean sample size , @xmath2=155 ) .",
    "we summarized the data as two principal component axes that explained over 97% of the variation and , using these axes , found little significant morphological variation across phylogeographic lineage - pairs ( fig .",
    "s2 ) . where there is significant variation ( fig .",
    "s2 ) , the differences are sex - specific and of small magnitude ",
    "e.g. , mean body size for female _ l. coggeri _ varies from 35.7@xmath32.7 to 38.5@xmath33.3 mm by lineage .",
    "many comparative studies use genetic distance as a proxy for time since divergence @xcite ; however , genetic distance might be decoupled from divergence time , especially if migration rates are high or ancestral population sizes are large @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we inferred divergence time and other demographic parameters for each lineage - pair by fitting an isolation - with - migration model to genetic data . for",
    "_ s. basiliscus _",
    "n and its sister species _ s. lewisi _ , we used previously published genetic data for eight loci @xcite to infer model parameters with ima2 @xcite . for the remaining contacts , we collected genomic data by sequencing transcriptomes from five individuals per lineage .",
    "these individuals were sampled far from the contact zone and were thus unlikely to contain recently introgressed alleles . after assembling and annotating these data , we inferred high - quality , high - coverage and non - coding single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , finding an average of 30.8k snps per lineage - pair ( table s3 ) . for each lineage - pair",
    ", we summarized the distribution of allele frequencies for shared and private alleles as an unfolded two - dimensional site frequency spectrum ( 2d - sfs ) ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "s3 ) , which we used with dadi to fit a isolation - with - migration model @xcite .    fitting a divergence model of isolation - with - migration to these data gave two primary results .",
    "first , divergence times vary 3.7@xmath4 , from 3.1 mya to 11.5 mya .",
    "second , estimates of nuclear divergence and divergence times are tightly correlated ( @xmath5=0.98 ; p - value = 0.01 ) , an unsurprising result given the low estimates for migration during divergence ( @xmath6 = 4@xmath7 to 3.5@xmath8 @xmath9 ; fig .",
    "full model parameters are available in table s4 .",
    "we used fine - scale spatial sampling and multilocus estimates of hybridization and introgression to infer the strength of ri .",
    "we sampled densely through each contact zone , averaging 20 individuals for each of 12 populations per contact ( @xmath10 ; table s1 ) , with the geographic scale of sampling determined by preliminary data on the respective mtdna transition ( range of transect length @xmath11 km ) . for _",
    "s. basiliscus _ n/_s .",
    "lewisi _ , we genotyped each lizard at six diagnostic , nuclear snps and one diagnostic , mitochondrial snp using a pcr - rflp approach . for all other lineage - pairs , we genotyped each lizard at ten diagnostic , nuclear snps and one diagnostic , mitochondrial snp .",
    "based on these genotypic data , we then calculated six indirect indices of ri ( average nuclear cline width , mitochondrial cline width , coefficient of variance of nuclear cline width , hardy - weinberg disequilibrium ( @xmath12 ) , linkage disequilibrium ( @xmath13 ) , and percent hybrids ) for each lineage - pair .",
    "importantly , we note that these indices are independent measures of isolation , though some would show correlated responses under certain conditions , such as under a tension zone model @xcite .",
    "we first describe general patterns at each contact zone before summarizing across all the zones , stepping from the least to most divergent contact ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in the _ l. coggeri _",
    "n / c contact , we see widespread introgression that extends throughout the sampled transect and evidence for two general patterns of introgression in nuclear loci : clines whose center and width is similar to the mtdna cline and clines which show broad introgression of the central ( c ) alleles into the northern ( n ) lineage ( fig . 3a ) . in the _ s. basiliscus _",
    "n / c contact , we were unable to infer clines at all but one of the nuclear loci ; it appears that northern alleles have almost completely introgressed into the central lineage ( fig .",
    "the asymmetric hybridization in both the _ l. coggeri _",
    "n / c and _ s. basiliscus _",
    "n / c contacts could stem from stochastic , demographic or selective processes ; disentangling the causes of asymmetry is not possible here",
    "so we focus on consensus patterns .",
    "both the _ c. rubrigularis _",
    "n / s and _ l. coggeri _ c / s show similar clines across all loci , and both show limited introgression beyond the contact zone ( fig . 3c and 3d ) . finally , there is no evidence for hybridization between _ s. basiliscus _",
    "n and its ecomorphologically similar sister species _ s. lewisi _ , even when sampled in sympatry ( fig .",
    "3e ) .    examining the correlation of divergence time with the six indices of ri",
    ", we see significant and strong correlations for all indices but mitochondrial cline width ( fig .",
    "4 ) . as predicted with increasing divergence time , we see decreased cline width and variance in cline width , fewer hybrids , and increased between- and within - loci disequilibria .",
    "these results are robust to our estimates of splitting times ; using pairwise nuclear divergence gives quantitatively similar results ( fig .",
    "s4 ) . note that not all indices of ri could be estimated for all contacts .",
    "we did not infer cline indices for the _ s. basiliscus _ n/_s .",
    "lewisi _ contact zone because of insufficient sampling , and we did not estimate either disequilibrium or hybridization measures for _ s. basiliscus _",
    "n / c as most nuclear loci were nearly monoallelic throughout the sampled contact zone .    to make our data more broadly comparable to other published data sets , we fit _ linear _ and _ quadratic _ models to the increase of ri through time @xcite .",
    "although these models have no formal theoretical basis , they reflect the speed and accumulation at which total ri accumulates .",
    "we fit the models to the three indices  @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and percent hybrids  which are expected to be zero at the start of divergence . using relative weights from aic scores",
    ", we determined that total ri , as measured by each of these three indices , best fits a model of quadratic growth with time ( fig .",
    "s5a - c ) .",
    "following @xcite , we then used our data to contrast three models for the accumulation of dmis and found that our data fit the _ slowdown _ model better than the _ linear _ or _ snowball _ models , suggesting the rate at which dmis accumulated slowed down with time ( fig .",
    "s5d - f ) .",
    "by looking across five contacts in a clade of closely - related and ecologically - similar skinks in the australian wet tropics , we find strong support for the prediction of increasing ri with divergence time . to our knowledge , this is the first comparative study of the strength of lineage boundaries across eco - morphologically similar lineages .",
    "these data support the view that phylogeographic splits of increasing depth can represent stages along the speciation continuum  including genetically - cohesive lineages with long - term potential for persistence .",
    "interestingly , most other data sets comparing ri with divergence time show significantly more noise than ours @xcite , even thogh these data sets were collected in controlled laboratory settings . in comparison , the strength of our correlations is unexpected , especially given that stochastic processes often influence hybrid zone structure and dynamics significantly @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the close fit between ri and divergence time in our study stems from the lack of overt divergent selection on eco - morphology , as varying strengths and forms of selection would be expected to introduce rate heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "in fact , the relationships between different indices of ri and divergence time are so strong that we can use them as a general metric for predicting the progress of speciation in this group .",
    "as has been suggested by @xcite , populations achieve `` species status '' when linkage disequilibrium ( measured here as @xmath13 ) is 0.5 . using this relationship",
    ", we find that our lineage - pairs are predicted to show @xmath14 at 7 myr or 8.1 myr after divergence ( and at 0.79 or 0.81% ndna divergence ) , under a linear versus quadratic model for accumulation of ri , respectively .",
    "although this specific calibration is contingent on our divergence time calibration and unlikely to be generalizable to other taxa , it does provide a yardstick for the tempo of speciation in this group .    given this rate of speciation  and noting that _ c. rubrigularis _",
    "n / s and _ l. coggeri _ c / s show significant but incomplete isolation with even less time  we suggest that the accumulation of ri here is rapid relative to a purely drift - driven model of the evolution of intrinsic ri via dmis .",
    "a simplistic model of drift - driven accumulation of dmis in allopatry suggests that the waiting time to speciation is approximately the number of substitutions needed for ri divided by the substitution rate @xcite , which , given the skinks estimated mutation rate , could be on the order of hundreds of millions of years .",
    "thus , accumulating substantial ri with minimal phenotypic divergence suggests ( 1 ) rapid drift - driven divergence along `` holey adaptive landscapes '' @xcite , ( 2 ) parallel selection driving mutation - order speciation @xcite , and/or ( 3 ) natural or sexual selection acting on more cryptic phenotypes , like chemiosensory production and perception .",
    "as yet , we lack the fine - scale ecological data necessary to characterize the barriers to gene flow acting in this group and to determine which of these hypothetical drivers of divergence are relevant @xcite .",
    "however , these data do confirm cryptic speciation among phylogeographic lineages and suggest that this could be common , in contrast to the present focus on speciation driven by divergent selection @xcite .",
    "looking beyond the velocity of ri accumulation to its acceleration , we find that the total strength of ri increases exponentially through time in this clade ( fig .",
    "s5a - c ) .",
    "the pattern of exponentially increasing ri emerges when individual barriers to gene flow combine multiplicatively rather than additively @xcite , and it is occasionally recovered in other studies @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that as barriers to gene flow start to evolve , the cumulative effect of these barriers can grow quickly .",
    "thus , species formation can be thought of as an accelerating process ; particularly as ri decreases gene flow , which typically further promotes divergence @xcite .",
    "further , although our data suggest the rate at which dmis accumulate might decrease through time ( fig .",
    "s5d - f ) , we refrain from over - interpreting these results because our indices of ri potentially include both pre - zygotic and post - zygotic factors and few data have addressed the model s assumptions of equal and multiplicative fitness effects @xcite .",
    "because we can quickly and cheaply query geographic variation within species using mtdna , deep mtdna divergence is often used as an initial hypothesis for species delimitation . however , deep mtdna divergence is neither necessary nor sufficient to delimit species @xcite , and it is often discordant with other genetic or phenotypic measures of divergence @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we provide additional evidence that mtdna often presents an idiosyncratic perspective on historical dynamics , finding that mitochondrial cline width is the sole index of ri that had a non - significant correlation with divergence time . given our and others findings of mtdna s idiosyncracy @xcite , we concur that the observation of deeply divergent mtdna phylogroups is a useful start of taxonomic and phylogeographic studies , but it certainly should not be the end .",
    "further , since researchers have begun cataloguing diversity within species , most species have been found to show geographically - restricted variation @xcite . why do some of these intraspecific lineages continuously diverge and exhibit reproductive isolation from sister - lineages , whereas others collapse @xcite ? as suggested by many , geography is a powerful determinant @xcite .",
    "but , as we see here , ri can take millions of years to accumulate , particularly in the absence of strong ecologically - driven divergence , suggesting that isolation must be sustained across millions of years to lead to genetically independent lineages . in the absence of historical stability",
    ", geography can be insufficient , leading to the extensive introgression and discordance often reported in other systems @xcite .",
    "thus , as a working hypothesis , we suggest that climatically and geomorphologically stable regions , such as the major refugia of the awt , are more likely to accumulate such cryptic diversity than are more spatio - environmentally dynamic regions . indeed , broad - range introgression and discordance are exceedingly rare in the awt , except amongst lineages endemic to the relatively unstable southern rainforest isolates @xcite .    finally , these data add to a growing body of literature that support a darwinian perspective on species formation @xcite and extend this perspective to cryptic diversification . whether from lineages that likely diverged with gene flow @xcite or lineages that diverged in allopatry @xcite , these data sets show that the accumulation of ri is often a gradual process and that species are not static entities .",
    "indeed , divergence is a continuous , reversible process @xcite . for these lineage - pairs , we find that the evolution of ri followed a predictable timeline during their divergence in allopatry ( fig",
    ". 4 ; fig .",
    "now that lineages have expanded following the last glacial maximum and the original barrier to gene flow ( _ i.e. _ , geography ) has disappeared , these lineage - pairs will move again along the continuum . for _",
    "l. coggeri _",
    "n / c and _ s. basiliscus _",
    "n / c , this initial divergence will likely be reversed , because the lineage - pairs are hybridizing freely in the apparent absence of ri . however , _ l. coggeri _",
    "c / s and _ c. rubrigularis _ n / s appear to be more strongly isolated , because the scale and extent of hybridization and introgression between these lineage - pairs are very limited . given the limited eco - morphological differentation of these lineages , we hypothesis this ri is intrinsic and not environmentally - dependent and , thus , likely to maintain lineage boundaries even in changing environments . as such , these lineage pairs",
    "will likely continue to diverge .",
    "that said , ri between these lineages is not complete , but these `` leaky '' species boundaries can serve as a source of novelty , whether through the evolution of reinforcement or through the selective introgression of adaptive alleles @xcite .",
