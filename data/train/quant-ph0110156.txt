    "assume the following hypotheses that describe the most general situation in which two distant parties communicate through a noisy environment :    1 .",
    "[ local ] alice and bob are _ separate _ entities that initially are _",
    "disjoint_. they belong to the same inertial reference frame and communicate by exchanging some physical system .",
    "[ dephasing ] the environment randomizes the phases between different energy eigenstates of the exchanged system while in transit .    from these hypotheses it will be shown that alice and bob can not synchronize their clocks .    in subsect .",
    "[ s : ip1 ] we explain the first hypothesis by giving its formal consequences . in subsect .",
    "[ s : ip2 ] we analyze the second hypothesis and explain how it describes a dephasing channel .",
    "the first hypothesis states the problem and ensures that initially alice and bob do not already share any kind of system that acts as a synchronized clock . by _ separate _",
    "we mean that at any given time alice and bob can not gain access to the same degrees of freedom and there is no direct interaction between alice and bob s systems .",
    "this can be described by the following properties of the system s hilbert space and hamiltonian . at time",
    "@xmath0 the hilbert space of the global system can be written as @xmath1 where the hilbert space @xmath2 refers to the system on which alice can operate at time @xmath0 , @xmath3 refers to bob s system , and @xmath4 describes the systems on which neither of them can operate . the time dependence in eq .",
    "( [ spazio ] ) does not imply that the global hilbert space changes in time , but it refers to the possibility that a system that was previously under alice s influence has been transferred to bob ( or _ viceversa _ ) , after a transient time in which it can not be accessed by any of them . since information _ must _ be encoded into a physical system , this mechanism describes any possible communication between them .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath5 where the time dependent @xmath6 and @xmath7 evolve the states in @xmath8 and @xmath9 under the control of alice and bob respectively , while @xmath10 evolves the system in transit between them when it is not accessible . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ spazio ] ) , at time @xmath0 the three terms on the right side of eq . ( [ hamilttot ] )",
    "commute , since they act on different hilbert spaces . for the same reason any operator under the influence of alice at time @xmath0 commutes with all bob s operator at the same time .",
    "a simple example may help explain this formalism .",
    "consider the situation in which the system is composed of three 1/2 spin particles ( qubits ) .",
    "a possible communication is then modeled by the sequence    = .8    _ i.e. _ initially alice s hilbert space @xmath8 contains spins 1 and 2 , and bob owns only spin 3 .",
    "alice then encodes some information on spin 2 ( eventually entangling it with spin 1 ) , and sends it to bob .",
    "there will be a time interval in which none of them can access spin 2 and this situation corresponds to having spin 2 belonging to @xmath11 .",
    "finally , bob receives spin 2 , and his hilbert space @xmath9 describes both spins 2 and 3 . notice that the form of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamilttot ] ) , where no interaction terms are present , allows each of them to act , at a given time @xmath0 , only on the spins that live in their own hilbert space at time @xmath0 .",
    "an analogous description applies also to more complicated scenarios , such as the exchange of light pulses . in this case ,",
    "causality constraints allow alice and bob to act only on localized traveling wave modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "thus , also here , it is possible to define a traveling system hilbert space @xmath11 that factorizes as in eq .",
    "( [ spazio ] ) . from the above example",
    ", it is easy to see that in each communication exchange , it is possible to define a _ departure _",
    "time @xmath12 after which the sender can not act any more on the system in transit , and an _ arrival _",
    "time @xmath13 before which the receiver can not yet act on such system .",
    "it is between these two times that the exchanged system belongs to @xmath11 .    in hyp .",
    "[ local ] by initially _",
    "we mean that alice and bob do not share any information prior to the first communication exchange .",
    "in particular this means that , before they start to interact , the state of the system factorizes as @xmath14 _",
    "i.e. _ the initial state is not entangled and they do not share any quantum information . here",
    "@xmath15 is the state of alice s system evaluated at the time at which she starts to act , while @xmath16 is the state of bob s system evaluated at the time at which _ he _ starts to act .",
    "for ease of notation , the tensor product symbol @xmath17 will be omitted in the following except when its explicit presence helps the comprehension .",
    "the second hypothesis imposes limitations to the information retrieved from the exchanged signal .",
    "the dephasing of the energy eigenstates describes the non - dissipative noise present in most non - ideal communication channels and implies a certain degree of decoherence in any quantum communication between alice and bob .",
    "define @xmath18 as the eigenstate relative to the eigenvalue @xmath19 of the free hamiltonian of the exchanged system @xmath20 .",
    "the label @xmath21 takes into account possible degeneracy of such eigenstate .",
    "we assume that during the travel , when neither alice nor bob can control the exchanged system in @xmath11 , the states @xmath18 undergo the transformation @xmath22 where the random phase @xmath23 is independent of @xmath21 .",

    "for this reason the dephasing is characterized by the joint probability function @xmath25 , that weights the probability that the energy levels @xmath18 and @xmath26 are affected by the phases @xmath24 and @xmath27 respectively .",

    "the situation described by ( [ udic ] ) is even worse , since not only such a delay may be present , but also the wave function of the system is degraded by dispersion effects . in both cases ,",
    "the information on the transit time @xmath58 that may be extracted from @xmath59 depends on the degree of randomness of @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath24 is a completely random quantity ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath29 ) , no information on the transit time can be obtained .",
    "this , of course , prevents the possibility of using classical synchronization protocols , where unknown delays in either the signal travel time or in the exchanged clock prove to be fatal .",
    "one might think that exploiting the apparently non - local properties of quantum mechanics ( _ e.g. _ entanglement ) , these limits can be overcome .",
    "in the following sections we will show that this is not the case .",

    "how does synchronization take place ?",
    "define @xmath60 and @xmath61 as the initial times of alice and bob s clocks as measured by an external clock .",
    "( of course , since they do not have a synchronized clock to start with , they can not measure @xmath60 and @xmath61 . )",

    "analogously for bob we define his pti as @xmath66 .",
    "if alice and bob share the data regarding their own ptis , they can not achieve synchronization : they need also a ` connecting time interval ' ( cti ) , _ i.e. _ a time interval that connects an event that took place on alice side with an event that took place on bob s side as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : events ] .",
    "= .8    in this framework , consider the case of einstein and eddington s clock synchronization .",
    "in einstein clock synchronization the ptis on alice side are the two times at which she sent and received back the signal she sends bob .",
    "bob s pti is the time at which he bounces back the signal to alice .",
    "the cti in this case measures the time difference between the events `` alice sends the signal '' and `` bob bounces the signal back '' .",
    "the protocol allows alice to recover the cti by simply dividing by two the time difference between her two ptis .",
    "the analysis of eddington s slow clock transfer is even simpler . in this case",
    "bob s pti is the time at which bob looks at the clock alice has sent him after synchronizing it with hers .",
    "the cti is , for example , the time difference between the event `` bob looks at the clock sent by alice '' and `` on alice side it s noon '' : bob can recover it just looking at the time shown on the clock he received from alice .    in this paper we show that in the presence of a dephasing communication channel ( as described in hyp .  [ dephasing ] ) , there is no way in which alice and bob may achieve a cti .",
    "the best that they can do is to collect a series of ptis related to different events and a collection of cti transit times corrupted by the noisy communication line : clock synchronization is thus impossible .      in this section",

    "i.e. _ @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this means that , at those two times , they introduce time dependent terms in the system hamiltonian : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the free hamiltonians of alice and bob s systems and @xmath71 and @xmath72 characterize the most general unitary transformations that they can apply to their systems .",

    "the label @xmath82 on @xmath75 refers to the fact that the event of sending the message happens locally on alice s side , so in principle she can measure such a quantity as referred to her clock as the pti @xmath83 .",

    "<S> the presented discussion takes also into account the possibility that the two distant parties who want to synchronize their clocks ( say alice and bob ) and who are localized in space , can entangle their systems by exchanging a certain number of quantum states and the possibility that they may employ the `` wave function collapse '' @xcite , through post - selection measurements . the intuitive idea behind </S>",
