    "collisional depolarization cross sections between an alkali - metal and rare gas atom play important role in understanding the global interactions between the two species . studies of excited atom collisions with other neutral atoms and molecules are key to understanding energy transfer processes , anisotropic cross sections , and the accurate description of the intermediate molecular properties of the colliding species  @xcite .",
    "collisional depolarization of the first excited @xmath4 state of cesium has been experimentally studied using a pump - probe technique  @xcite and by using incoherent light sources as optical excitation  @xcite .",
    "the depolarization of the second excited @xmath4 states of cs i and rb i in collisions with rare gas atoms have been studied using a level - crossing technique  @xcite . to our knowledge , there are no experimental observations of the disalignment cross section for the third excited state ( @xmath0 ) of cesium .",
    "we anticipate that this is due to the relatively high energy ( 3.198 ev ) of the 8p level with respect to the first ionization limit ( @xmath5 3.89 ev ) that makes the typical pump - probe ( stepwise scheme ) experimentally difficult .",
    "our experimental technique is based on a @xmath6-type double - resonance transition . in the @xmath6-type scheme",
    "the probe laser resonantly induces downward transitions from the upper @xmath0 level of the pumped transition to the @xmath1 level .",
    "this process is called stimulated emission pumping ( sep ) .",
    "the advantages of the pump - sep scheme are that it can be used to probe either high - lying energy levels of atoms which are difficult to reach using stepwise excitation when the probed level is close to the ionization level , or high - lying electronic vibrational - rotational levels of molecules close to the dissociation or ionization limit of the electronic state under study .",
    "thus , in this work , we have used a nanosecond pump - sep technique which is particularly well suited for the study of the dynamical properties of atomic and molecular systems , e.g. rydberg energy levels which are relatively inaccessible using a typical stepwise scheme .    in this work ,",
    "we have measured the linear polarization dependence of the @xmath7 transition as a function of argon gas pressure using the pump - sep technique . from the measurement we extracted the alignment - dependent collisional cross section of the @xmath0 cesium in collision with argon atoms .",
    "our result yields a direct measure of the importance of the linear polarization to the alignment - dependent inelastic process in alkali - noble - gas collisions and provides additional insight into the collisional relaxation for the higher - lying energy levels of alkali atoms .",
    "an extensive theoretical treatment of collisional depolarization of atomic fluorescence has been developed by ref .",
    "comprehensive reviews on the interpretation of atomic alignment and linear polarization , and the influence of spin - orbit coupling to the alignment parameter are discussed by andersen and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "theoretical expressions for the rate constants of the anisotropic collisional relaxation of atomic polarization moments in terms of multipole moments are derived in ref .",
    "in this section we provide a brief overview of the experimental scheme and the arrangement that was used to perform the experiments .",
    "the cesium transitions involved in this experiment are illustrated by the partial energy level diagram in fig . 1 and a schematic overview of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we use a nanosecond pulsed neodymium - doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( nd : yag ) laser which operates simultaneously at 532 nm and 355 nm with a pulse repetition rate of 20 hz .",
    "this laser is used to drive two home - built grazing - incidence littman - metcalf cavity design dye laser oscillators .",
    "the output from the third harmonic generator ( 355 nm ) is used to produce a uv pump laser at 387.92 nm to populate the @xmath0 level while the output of the second harmonic generator ( 532 nm ) is used to produce the ir probe laser at 894.72 nm to drive @xmath8 transition as probe .",
    "the dye laser oscillators operate in a single transverse mode and the output beam is highly linearly polarized through use of glan - thompson calcite prism polarizers having extinction ratios of better than 10@xmath9 .",
    "both dye lasers are equipped with dye circulating systems to maintain an average power of about 2 mw .",
    "@xmath10    [ fig1 ]    a temperature - controlled liquid crystal variable retarder ( lcr ) is used to electronically vary the linear polarization direction of the probe laser to be parallel or perpendicular to that of the pump laser .",
    "polarization switching of the lcr is achieved by applying the necessary voltage to the retarder via a computer - controlled liquid crystal digital interface .",
    "the beams of the pump and probe pulsed dye lasers are directed collinearly , but in opposite directions , into the interaction region of the cesium cell .",
    "a resistively heated nonmagnetic cylindrical aluminum oven was used to generate the desired vapor pressure of atomic cs in the cell .",
    "the oven , which houses the sealed pyrex cell containing cs vapor , was wrapped with an aluminum oxide blanket and an insulator to maintain the relative temperature to better than @xmath11c via a temperature controller .",
    "cesium vapor cells with argon gas pressures ranging up to 133 mbar were prepared using an oil - free vacuum system in a 25.4 mm diameter by 50.8 mm length cell .",
    "the background pressure of the pure cs cell is about @xmath12 mbar .",
    "after the satisfaction of the resonance in the @xmath0 level by uv pump laser the most of the population decays to the @xmath1 level by the ir sep laser due to the stimulated emission  @xcite .",
    "the intensities of the cascade fluorescence from the @xmath1 level to the ground @xmath13 level were recorded at 852.12 nm by using an infrared sensitive water - cooled photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) which was located at right angles to the propagation directions of the lasers . a combination of interference and color glass filters was used in front of the pmt in order to remove background light .",
    "all the cables used in the experiment were electrically shielded and the optical table was grounded in order to suppress electronic pick - up and noise on the observed signal .",
    "@xmath14    [ fig2 ]    the amplified output of the pmt signal was sent to a boxcar which was opened after a 1-ns delay following the laser pulses .",
    "the recorded signal collected for each state of laser polarization consisted of 100x10@xmath15 data points accumulated during 4 seconds .",
    "the boxcar operated in a 100 sample averaging mode , where the average single - shot level within the detection gate is digitized . since the lifetimes of the @xmath1 and @xmath16 levels are shorter than the lifetime of the @xmath0 level ( 305 ns  @xcite ) we distinguished the signal from the spontaneous emission decay of the atoms from the @xmath0 level to the lower levels .",
    "typical signal size was about 10@xmath17 photons for each laser pulse .",
    "the digitized signals were stored on a computer using a labview program while monitoring the size of the signal within the gate - width in real time using a digital oscilloscope operating at 500 mhz with 2 gsa / s .",
    "comparison of the signals , detected when the probe polarization angle is @xmath18 = 0 versus @xmath18 = @xmath19/2 allows definition of a linear polarization degree .",
    "a linear polarization degree is measured when intensities @xmath20 and @xmath21 according to    @xmath22    since an absolute intensity ratio of the signals is sensitive only to the relative polarization directions of the lasers , any variations of the laser intensities with experimental factors such as absorbing medium density , fluorescence background , and sensitivity of the gated boxcar integrator , collectively have negligible effect on the intensity ratio .    for atoms with non - zero nuclear spin , the total angular momentum of the atomic ensemble couples to the nuclear spin moment to produce a new space - fixed total angular momentum @xmath23 .",
    "the total electronic angular momentum will then precess about @xmath23 so that the initially prepared space - fixed frame is altered .",
    "this precession is results from the hyperfine structure and affects the initially prepared alignment at @xmath24=0 by a pump laser . in the case of @xmath25cs ,",
    "the coupling of nuclear spin @xmath26 with @xmath27 in the @xmath0 level introduces an oscillating time dependence in the alignment .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of the alignment under the influence of the hyperfine structure can be evaluated .",
    "@xmath28 , whose value depends on the hyperfine energy separations in the probed @xmath0 level , is the main quantity to be measured in the experiment and strongly depends on the time delay between the pump and probe laser pulses .",
    "this means that the excited level can be characterized by an overall population and the axially symmetric electronic alignment tensor component @xmath29 .",
    "the quantum mechanical treatment of the detection of alignment and polarization of the emitted light in terms of alignment have been given in detail  @xcite , and the applications to the polarization measurement using two - photon pulsed pump - probe excitation has been described in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "thus , the linear polarization in terms of alignment is defined  @xcite as    @xmath30    the pump laser excitation on the @xmath31 transition creates an initial value of electronic alignment @xmath32 . in the absence of any perturbations this quantity evolves in time according to @xmath33 , where the quantity @xmath34 is the hyperfine depolarization coefficient and strongly depends on the temporal width of and arrival time of the pump and probe lasers into the interaction region of the atomic oven .",
    "measurements of the overlap time of the pulses were made using two fast vacuum photodiodes with 500 ps rise time . at @xmath35 , in the absence of any perturbations and systematic error , the theoretical value of polarization is 1/7 ( 14.29% ) .",
    "the linear polarization degree evolves in time due to hyperfine structure in the excited level .",
    "we have measured the time evolution of polarization from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ns in our earlier work  @xcite . at @xmath37",
    "ns the linear polarization for the @xmath7 transition is obtained to be 12.4(5)% .",
    "this measurement is in excellent agreement with theory  @xcite .",
    "figure  3 illustrates typical fluorescence signal immediately after stimulated emission pump laser arrives into the interaction region .",
    "the sharp peak confirms depletion of the excited state population by the stimulated emission pump transition and this is because the cascade fluorescence from the @xmath1 level populates the @xmath16 level exclusively .",
    "the population of the @xmath16 level subsequently decays by spontaneous emission to the ground level .",
    "this appears as a sharp increase in the signal size within about 13 ns at fwhm , compared to the spontaneous emission which occurs over hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "we opened a boxcar gatewidth at 30 ns to measure the full intensity of the cascade fluorescence from the stimulated emission signal only .",
    "a linearly polarized pump laser selectively populates the zeeman sublevels of the cs @xmath0 level . after introducing argon atoms ,",
    "the excited cs and ground level ar atoms collisionally mix the population among the zeeman sublevels . using rate equation analysis , population densities in terms of total population @xmath38 and alignment @xmath39",
    "were expressed in our earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "considering collisional mixing among the @xmath40 sublevels , the measured signals for the @xmath41 transition can be written as @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ integral1 ] ) and ( [ integral2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq1n ] ) , a linear polarization can be readily expressed in terms of the depolarization cross section and the pressure of the buffer gas as @xmath46 where @xmath47 } { \\left[1-\\frac{1}{\\gamma_a~t}(1-e^{-\\gamma_a~t})\\right]}. \\label{z}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) , @xmath48 is the radiative decay rate , t is the overlap time of the pulses , and @xmath49 is defined as @xmath48+@xmath50 where @xmath50=@xmath51 is the collisional rate . here @xmath52 is the disalignment rate coefficient , @xmath53 is the argon density which depends on the argon pressure and thermal energy constant , and @xmath54 is the disalignment cross section .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath55 may be factored since @xmath54 typically depends weakly on the velocities of the colliding cs - ar atoms so that @xmath56 , where @xmath54 is the disalignment cross section .",
    "thus , we denoted @xmath57 as @xmath58 which is the average speed of the colliding cs - ar atoms over the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of relative velocities at the @xmath59c cesium cell temperature .",
    "the left side of eq .",
    "( [ polz ] ) is the measured linear polarization value at various argon gas pressures .",
    "measured linear polarization degree as a function of argon gas pressures ranging up to 133 mbar is illustrated in fig .",
    "the result of the best fit to the data from the weighted non - linear least - squares fitting program is shown as the solid line . from the measurement @xmath54",
    "was extracted .",
    "+ collisional depolarization cross sections for the lowest few principal quantum numbers of the cs i @xmath60 series are summarized in table i. experimental results are obtained by a broadened level crossing technique  @xcite or by a pump - stimulated probe approach , as described in the present report . also listed",
    "are theoretical determinations of the cross - sections .",
    "we see in table i that the cross section increases sharply for the @xmath61 level in comparison with the @xmath16 ; the further increase associated with the measurements made here on @xmath0 level is much more modest .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given the typical sharp variations , with effective principal quantum number , of experimental observables associated with excited atomic levels .",
    "however , previous observations of collisional process cross sections have revealed nonmonotonic behavior in some cases .",
    "for instance , gallagher  @xcite reported that the cross sections for the collisional angular momentum mixing rise approximately as @xmath62 for lower @xmath63 , reach a peak , and then decreases for larger @xmath63 .",
    "other researchers have reported oscillatory cross sections in some cases and large oscillations in the dependence of linewidth on principal quantum number  @xcite .",
    "these results motivate us to explore disalignment cross section measurements for a wider range of principal quantum numbers ; the technique used here is ideally suited for such measurements .",

    "however , future experiments on greater @xmath63 values could reveal any systematic structure on the @xmath63 dependence .",
    "we have introduced a time - resolved double - resonance uv - ir nanosecond pump - sep technique to provide experimental data on the depolarization cross section of the cesium @xmath0 level from the measurement of polarization degree of the @xmath3 transition . from the measurement at various gas pressures we extracted the collisional disalignment cross section using nonlinear least square fit to the data and obtained 785(57)@xmath64 .",
    "this work complements and substantiates our earlier studies of the collisional disalignmnet cross section of the excited states of cesium at lower @xmath63 values .",
