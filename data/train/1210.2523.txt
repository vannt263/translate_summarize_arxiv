    "until recently , the only experimental studies about the adsorption of quantum gases ( @xmath0he , h@xmath1 and ne ) on carbon nanotubes were performed in tube associations called bundles .",
    "@xcite in these structures , the only places available for adsorption are their outer surfaces , in particular the grooves between two adjacent tubes .",
    "@xcite other possible locations are the triangular interstices among three neighboring tubes in the bulk part of the bundle .",
    "however , those places seem to be not populated .",
    "@xcite the other option is the adsorption on the inner surface of nanotubes , but to do so one has to remove the caps that close them at the ends . to our knowledge , there is no experimental data on this possibility for quantum gases , the only studies being up to now theoretical .",
    "@xcite    a recent experimental work showed that it is possible to isolate a single carbon nanotube and adsorb ar and kr on its outer surface .",
    "@xcite the experimental phase diagrams for these classical noble gases were qualitatively similar to those on graphite .",
    "for instance , they include a @xmath3 phase for ar on tubes whose diameters are in the range 1 - 3 nm .",
    "however , recent quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite of h@xmath1 adsorbed on nanotubes with diameters between @xmath4 7 and 22 @xmath5 indicate that this structure was formed only on the widest tube considered , a ( 16,16 ) one in the standard nomenclature .",
    "@xcite contrarily to flat surfaces , mainly graphite , in which the phase diagrams of quantum gases are quite well known from both theory and experiment , adsorption on curved surfaces is much less studied .",
    "apart from studies related to wetting transitions of classical gases on cylinders and spheres ,  @xcite the possible new phases that curvature can produce in quantum gases are still rather unknown  @xcite and it is plausible to imagine that experiments on isolated nanotubes can be exposed to quantum gases in a nearby future .",
    "in this work , we have used the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method to obtain the phase diagrams of @xmath0he adsorbed on isolated carbon nanotubes with radii ranging between 3.42 and 10.85  .",
    "these correspond to armchair nanotubes between ( 5,5 ) and ( 16,16 ) in the standard nomenclature .",
    "our main aim is to compare our results with both the ones for h@xmath1 on the same surface  @xcite and those for @xmath0he on graphene ,  @xcite a flat surface that can be considered a tube of infinite radius .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the dmc algorithm used to solve the corresponding schrdinger equations from which we inferred the corresponding phase diagrams .",
    "the phase diagrams themselves will be shown in section iii , and the paper will close by summarizing our main conclusions in section iv .",
    "the diffusion monte carlo method allows for solving the many - body schrdinger equation exactly if the constituents of the system are bosons ,  @xcite as it is the case of @xmath0he atoms .",
    "since it is a stochastic method , the results are always produced with some statistical uncertainties .",
    "the different carbon nanotubes were considered as rigid cylinders in which the individual carbon positions were kept constant throughout the simulation .",
    "the interaction between any of those carbons and each helium atom was of the lennard - jones type with parameters taken from ref .",
    ", i.e. , the carbon - helium interactions act as an external potential to be included in the schrdinger equation to solve .",
    "the helium - helium interparticle interaction was taken to be a standard aziz potential .",
    "@xcite    dmc solves the @xmath6-body schrdinger equation in imaginary time .",
    "the walkers ( sets of @xmath7 coordinates ) representing the system evolve in time through a diffusion process and an energy selection rule named branching . in order to reduce the statistical variance ,",
    "the free diffusion movement is corrected by a drift term that enhances the sampling in regions where the exact wave function is reasonably expected to be large .",
    "technically , this importance sampling is implemented by introducing a guiding wave function which avoids the sampling inside the cores of the interaction and fixes the phase of the system under study . in particular , for an adsorbed liquid layer we use @xmath8 \\prod_i \\psi(r_i ) \\ , \\label{trial1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are the @xmath0he positions .",
    "the first part of the product in eq .",
    "( [ trial1 ] ) is a jastrow function that depends on the distances @xmath10 between the atoms .",
    "there , @xmath11 , is a variational parameter fixed at 3.07  .",
    "@xcite @xmath12 is the same one - body function than the one used in ref .",
    ", whose role is to radially confine the moving particles around the minimum of the collective sum of all c - he interactions . to do so , it has a maximum at a distance of @xmath13    from the surface of the different tubes and decreases monotonously both for larger and smaller separations .",
    "when the cylinder is coated with a solid layer , we introduce in the trial wave function a factor , @xmath14 \\right\\ }   \\ ,   \\label{trialsol}\\ ] ] that multiplies the jastrow part ( eq . [ trial1 ] ) . with this approach , each helium atom",
    "is mainly sampled in the vicinity of its associated crystallographic position @xmath15 .",
    "the value of the @xmath16 parameter for the different solid phases were the same as the ones used for the same phases in a previous simulation on graphene .",
    "the nanotubes considered in this work , together with their respective radii ( distance from the center of the tube to the carbon surface ) and the energy per particle in the infinite dilution limit , @xmath17 , are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "those energy values were obtained from simulations including a single helium atom on a tube 70    long .",
    "what we observe is that , in general @xmath17 increases with the tube radius , but it is far from the value of a flat surface . in that table",
    ", @xmath18 is the most probable radial distance of a single helium atom to the center of each tube . in the remaining of the paper , all the adsorbate densities",
    "will be calculated using that distance as the radius of the helium cylinder that coats the carbon nanotube .",
    "there is no simple explanation for the evolution of @xmath17 as a function of the tube radius beyond a general increase when it increases .",
    "for instance , @xmath17 is slightly lower for the ( 14,14 ) tube than for the ( 16,16 ) one . to try to understand this effect and its connection with the curvature of the adsorbing surface , we calculated the difference in the potential energy felt by a helium particle located 2.87    above the center of one of the hexagons that conform the tube ( @xmath16 ) and for an atom located above the center of a c - c bond ( @xmath19 ) at the same height .",
    "this difference is an estimation of the corrugation of the potential surface . in graphene , a flat structure ,",
    "those values are @xmath20 and @xmath21 k. this means a difference of 7.53 k. that is a measure of the energy barrier that @xmath0he atoms have to jump in order to explore the graphene surface .",
    "the corresponding average potential energy from a full dmc calculation of a single helium on that structure is -151.43 @xmath22 0.05 k , what indicates that the particle explores also less favorable positions .",
    "the respective pairs of potential energies for the tubes under consideration are @xmath23 and @xmath24 k ( a difference of 6.79 k ) for the ( 14,14 ) tube , to be compared to @xmath25 and @xmath26 k ( 8.13 k ) for the ( 16,16 ) one .",
    "the dmc potential energy averages are -125.7 @xmath22 0.1 and -125.6 @xmath22 0.1 k , respectively , i.e. , virtually identical .",
    "this means that simply summing up the he - carbon interactions in a reduced number of positions is not a precise guide neither for @xmath17 nor for the average potential interaction .",
    "the corrugation effect in a single carbon hexagon is similar for a planar and for a curved environment but the potential energy and @xmath17 are smaller ( in absolute value ) than in planar graphene because the curved adsorbent is globally less attractive .",
    ".the set of armchair carbon nanotubes considered in this work , their tube radii ( @xmath27 ) together with the helium adsorption energy ( @xmath17 ) in the infinite dilution limit . also included for comparison is the same value for graphene , taken from ref . .",
    "@xmath18 is the most probable distance of a single @xmath0he atom to the center of the tube . [",

    "diffusion monte carlo calculations has allowed us to study the phase diagrams of @xmath0he adsorbed on carbon nanotubes of different radius . in principle , the ground state of this system should be a curved counterpart of the @xmath2 structure found in graphite and graphene .",
    "this is what have been experimentally observed for heavier noble gases  @xcite adsorbed on wider tubes .",
    "in fact , any armchair nanotube ( @xmath28,@xmath28 ) fulfills the necessary prescription for the formation of a seamless registered solid on it , i.e. , its indexes ( @xmath28,@xmath29 ) follow the restriction @xmath30 , @xmath31 being an integer . however , as it can be inferred from the results of table [ table2 ] , the ground state of @xmath0he on those tubes is either a liquid or an incommensurate solid , not a @xmath2 arrangement .",
    "a comparison to the case of h@xmath1 on the same substrates ,  @xcite in which the @xmath2 solid is the ground state for a ( 16,16 ) tube , indicates that , at least for the widest tubes considered , the weakness of the helium - helium and helium - carbon interactions are responsible for the lack of stability of that ( or any other ) commensurate structure .",
    "another relevant feature we have found is that for tubes whose radius is lower than @xmath32  , the ground state is an incommensurate solid , whereas from the ( 12,12 ) tube up , the minimum energy structure corresponds to a liquid .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the above mentioned weakness in the helium interactions combined with the lower density of the curved @xmath2 phase in comparison to planar graphene .",
    "our results for the @xmath0he phase diagrams show a significant dependence on the curvature of the different tubes .",
    "as table [ table1 ] shows , the energy in the infinite dilution limit for a ( 5,5 ) tube is @xmath33 k larger than the same property for a ( 12,12 ) cylinder .",
    "this means that to obtain an energy per particle closer to the corresponding to a flat structure , one would have to increase more the number of helium neighbors of each adsorbed atom for a thinner tube than for a wider one .",
    "this leads to high densities and the formation of curved solids .",
    "these structures are incommensurate rather than registered because the necessary helium densities are higher than the corresponding to a @xmath2 ( or any other , see table [ table2 ] ) commensurate structure . for instance , in the ( 8,8 ) tube the density of a @xmath2 curved structure is 0.0412 @xmath34 ( table [ table2 ] ) , to be compared to 0.0636 @xmath34 for the same arrangement on graphite and to 0.0744 @xmath34 of the incommensurate solid on the same cylinder . however ,",
    "when the diameter of the tube grows the curvature of the substrate is reduced and arrangements with lower densities , i.e. , liquids , become stable .",
