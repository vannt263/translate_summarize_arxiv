    "the hot big - bang model of modern cosmology is based on the assumption that the large scale geometry and dynamics of the universe can be described by an exact flrw model , with more detailed and smaller scale physical phenomena , such as density fluctuations or gravitational waves , being described by perturbed fl models , i.e.  by solutions of the efe linearized about an exact fl model .",
    "we begin with the premise that it is important to study cosmological models more general than perturbed fl models .",
    "in particular one is interested in the set @xmath3 , namely , the set of all universes that are compatible with current observations ( ellis 2004 ) .",
    "a member of this set must have an epoch , possibly finite , during which the model is close to fl ; at early or later times it may deviate significantly from fl .",
    "more generally we are interested in the set @xmath4 of _ all _ cosmological models , and in the relationship between @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 , the set of all fl models .",
    "for example , we want to study the relation between linearly perturbed fl models and models that are close to fl in some well - defined , gauge - invariant sense , and satisfy the exact efe .",
    "are nonlinear effects perhaps significant in close - to - fl models ?",
    "another question that takes one outside the realm of linearly perturbed fl models is the detailed nature of the generic cosmological singularity .    with the preceding discussion as motivation we consider the class @xmath4 of all cosmological models ,",
    "whose state at time @xmath6 can be represented by a vector @xmath7 in a state space @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution of a model universe is then described by a curve @xmath9 in @xmath8 , called an orbit , that will be a solution of a system of first order autonomous evolution equations and constraints of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes partial differentiation with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath12 , and @xmath13 denotes possible higher order spatial derivatives .",
    "the goal is to choose state variables that remain bounded during the evolution of the model and a time variable @xmath6 such that @xmath14 at the initial singularity and @xmath15 at late times .    within this framework",
    ", classes of models with symmetries will be represented by invariant subsets of @xmath8 , the most important being the subset @xmath16 that describes the fl cosmologies .",
    "one expects that the orbits of close - to - fl models will shadow orbits in @xmath16 .    the appropriate mathematical vehicle for implementing the above program is the orthonormal frame formalism , since it expresses the efe directly as first order ( in time ) autonomous evolution equations .",
    "it is also necessary to introduce a process of normalization in order to create bounded variables .",
    "a choice that has proven effective is the so - called _ hubble normalization_. this approach to the study of cosmological dynamics has been discussed in some detail in wainwright & ellis 1997 , and more recently by coley 2003 , with emphasis on spatially homogeneous models . since then the approach has been extended to models without symmetry by uggla 2003 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec_hub ]",
    "we describe the principal features of the hubble - normalized state space , and in section  [ sec_c_i ] we discuss close - to - fl models and the related notion of isotropization . in section  [ sec_sh ]",
    "we give an overview of the dynamics of a special class of models in the cosmological hierarchy , the nontilted spatially homogeneous cosmologies . in section  [ sec_vac_num ]",
    "we describe a candidate for the past attractor in the hubble - normalized state space , and mention some recent numerical simulations which support this proposal . in section  [ sec_col ]",
    "we briefly introduce a modification of hubble normalization which provides a description of nontilted spatially homogeneous models that undergo recollapse .",
    "section  [ sec_conclusion ] contains our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we give the motivation for introducing hubble - normalized variables , and describe the principal features of the resulting hubble - normalized state space and evolution equations .",
    "one of the rationals for using dynamical systems methods in cosmology is the hope that one can describe the evolution of cosmological models near the initial singularity by means of a _",
    "past attractor _ of a cosmological dynamical system , and the dynamics at late times in a particular epoch by means of a _",
    "future attractor_.    in order to formulate the einstein field equations as a dynamical system it is clear that one has to normalize the variables , since near the initial singularity physical variables typically diverge and at late times typically tend to zero .",
    "physical considerations suggest that in a cosmological setting , normalization with the hubble scalar of the fundamental congruence is an appropriate choice .",
    "firstly , consider the density parameter @xmath17 , which plays a fundamental role in cosmology , in that it measures the influence of the matter on the dynamics . in geometrized units , it is defined to be the matter density @xmath18 divided by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the hubble scalar .",
    "secondly , the extent to which the overall expansion of the universe is close to isotropy is measured by the ratio of the shear ( the trace - free part of the expansion tensor ) to the hubble scalar .    the importance of hubble normalization appears to have first been mentioned in the literature by kristian & sachs 1966 ( see page 398 ) in connection with their general analysis of the potential constraints that observations of distant galaxies can place on the geometry of spacetime .",
    "the role of hubble - normalized variables emerges again when one analyzes the potential constraints that arise from observations of the cmb ( maartens 1995 , 1996 ) . in both analyses",
    "one finds that bounds are placed on hubble - normalized physical and geometrical quantities .",
    "our principal interest , however , lies in using hubble - normalized variables as dynamical variables , which dates back to collins 1971 , who gave a qualitative analysis of the dynamics of some special classes of cosmological models .",
    "working within the orthonormal frame formalism we introduce hubble - normalized variables and write the efe as first order evolution equations in the hubble - normalized state space . for simple classes of ever - expanding models , for example open fl models , and spatially homogeneous models of bianchi type i , the hubble - normalized state space is bounded .",
    "near the singularity physical variables such as the matter density diverge , but the hubble scalar also diverges and at such a rate that the corresponding hubble - normalized quantity , the density parameter @xmath21 , remains bounded .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath20 is close to zero , then the other physical variables are equally close to zero , so that the hubble - normalized quantities are bounded .    for more general models , however , it turns out that this simple picture is not valid  _ the hubble - normalized state space is unbounded_. the primary reason is that the hubble - normalized weyl curvature tensor can assume arbitrarily large values .",
    "all available evidence , however , suggests that _ the hubble - normalized variables are bounded into the past _ , i.e.  on approach to the initial singularity .",
    "in addition , if there is a positive cosmological constant there is strong evidence that the hubble - normalized variables are also bounded into the future .",
    "thus , even though the hubble - normalized state space is unbounded , one expects that the evolution equations will admit a past attractor and a future attractor .",
    "when one formulates the efe as a dynamical system , one uses a time variable @xmath6 that potentially assumes all real values .",
    "asymptotic regimes _ are then defined by the limits @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "cosmologists model the physical universe as a sequence of epochs in time , an epoch being identified by which source term is dynamically dominant . a typical succession of epochs is i ) inflationary , dominated by a scalar field @xmath24 ,    \\ii ) radiation - dominated , @xmath25 ,    \\iii ) matter - dominated , @xmath26 ,    \\iv ) accelerating , dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath27 .    with each source term",
    "is associated a hubble - normalized energy density , @xmath28 and a particular epoch is defined as the time interval during which a particular @xmath29 is dominant .    in analytic work",
    "one typically assumes the presence of one or two source terms and one investigates the asymptotic regimes , which are described mathematically by the past attractor and future attractor of the dynamical system .",
    "thus , for example , the past asymptotic regime of the radiation - dominated epoch would physically coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch and the future asymptotic regime would coincide with the beginning of the matter - dominated epoch .",
    "a cosmological model is a spacetime with a preferred timelike vector field @xmath30 whose metric is a solution of the efe with appropriate matter / energy content .",
    "it is assumed that there is an epoch during which the model is expanding , i.e.  the preferred vector field satisfies @xmath31 where @xmath20 is referred to as the hubble scalar .",
    "we assume furthermore that @xmath30 is the normal vector field to a family of spacelike hypersurfaces @xmath32 , thereby defining a time variable .",
    "we introduce an orthonormal frame @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , and choose the spatial frame vectors @xmath35 to be fermi - propagated . within this framework ,",
    "the gravitational field variables are the commutation functions @xmath36 associated with the frame , defined by @xmath37 = \\gam^c{}_{ab}\\ , \\mathbf{e}_c.\\ ] ] they may conveniently be expressed in terms of geometric quantities \\",
    "{ h , _ , _ , a_,n _ } , according to @xmath38 ( see for example we , page 32 ) .",
    "here @xmath39 is the acceleration and @xmath40 is the shear of the congruence @xmath30 , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 determine the curvature of the spacelike hypersurfaces ( we , pages 18 , 19 , 34 ) .    as regards matter / energy content we consider a cosmological constant @xmath43 and a perfect fluid with 4-velocity vector field @xmath44 and linear barotropic equation of state @xmath45 , with @xmath46 . in the orthonormal frame formalism the perfect fluid",
