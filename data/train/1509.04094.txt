    "in this section we introduce the concept of `` hidden force '' in order to understand effective mass in systems that contain non - apparent mechanical elements.@xcite this approach is first explained by means of simple examples from mechanics .",

    "the acceleration @xmath9 is smaller than that expected for a non - rotating mass of the same magnitude , i.e. @xmath10 . by introducing the effective mass as so defined , it is thus possible to obtain the correct acceleration from one simple equation .     and",

    "so the acceleration becomes @xmath11 , and the effective mass is given by @xmath12 a plot of @xmath13 vs @xmath14 is shown in fig .",

    "1(c ) : the hidden - force picture starts by ignoring the presence of the spring and regarding the system as a free mass subject to a hidden force @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the spring constant and @xmath3 the displacement . in the case when the external driving force is sinusoidal at angular frequency @xmath20 , @xmath21 , the acceleration can be calculated from the equation of motion , @xmath22 .",

    "the effective modulus becomes equal to @xmath238 , identical to that of the previously considered mass - and - spring model , because in this limit the masses @xmath207 do not move and the square truss plays the role of a massless , rigid connector , resulting in two springs of constant @xmath217 in series that are equivalent to a single spring of constant @xmath96 . in this limit",

    "let us now turn to a more general 1d mass - and - spring model that can exhibit double - negative behavior , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the plots for @xmath86 and @xmath89 are the same as for fig .",
    "9(d ) and ( e ) for equivalent dimensionless parameters .",
    "we conclude this section by emphasizing that effective mass and modulus are not just theoretical constructs but also experimentally measurable quantities . according to their definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ five1 ] ) , ( [ three1 ] ) and ( [ fourt1 ] ) , it suffices in principle to put pressure , force or displacement sensors at the appropriate points inside the metamaterial , and then the effective parameters can be experimentally derived .",
    "in contrast , merely measuring the dispersion relation , that depends on the combination @xmath253 or @xmath254 , will not in general be sufficient to distinguish effective mass from effective modulus .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed the concepts of hidden force and hidden source of volume to respectively account for the effective densities and moduli of acoustic metamaterials .",
    "the superficially strange concepts of negative density and modulus are naturally accounted for in this picture when the hidden force / source operates in antiphase to and is bigger in magnitude than the force / volume - change engendered in its absence .",
    "we illustrate our approach in 1d for well - known air - based metamaterials involving membranes , helmholtz resonators or side holes with the inclusion of the new case of an array of masses attached to membranes by springs .",
    "we also introduce examples based on generic mass - and - spring models , in which case the concept of a hidden source of volume is replaced by the concept of a hidden expander of displacement .",
    "deciding at first glance what contributes to an effective density or to an effective modulus depends on the system . for air - based acoustic metamaterials ,",
    "membranes only contribute to the effective density whether or not they have an attached mass and spring .",
    "the reason for this is that they only involve local , time - dependent hidden forces that provide a net force on the unit cell .",
    "a similar result applies to the mass - and - spring model representing a solid - matrix acoustic metamaterial based on heavy spheres in a soft matrix . in air - based acoustic metamaterials",
    "the effective modulus arises because of time - dependent hidden sources of air volume associated with helmholtz resonators or side holes , that only produce pairs of forces acting equally and oppositely on either side of the unit cell ( i.e. resulting in a zero net force on the unit cell ) .",
    "a similar result applies to the mass - and - spring models containing light rigid hinged trusses attached to masses .",
    "although not discussed here , the inclusion of extra degrees of freedom in mass - and - spring or solid - state models , e.g. through rotations , can also result in an effective modulus through the production of pairs of equal and opposite forces.@xcite    the extension of these ideas to 2d or 3d should be straightforward , whether for fluid , solid or multi - phase metamaterials.@xcite in these cases , due regard should be taken of possible anisotropic properties and of the different acoustic modes of propagation such as longitudinal , shear or flexural , for example . for simplicity in our treatment we have restricted our attention to fundamental resonances , namely of membranes , helmholtz resonators or side holes , although the inclusion of higher - order resonances in the general framework presented is possible .",
    "we have also ignored material damping .",
    "this has the advantage of highlighting the damping caused by the intrinsic metamaterial properties .",
    "frequency regions for single - negative - parameter behavior exhibiting damping can be referred to as band gaps , although they should not to be confused with those arising from purely phononic effects ( generally observed at higher frequencies ) .",
    "frequency regions for double - negative behavior are of particular interest because of their potential for high - resolution focusing .",
    "finally , acoustic metamaterials will probably be entering the application stage as commercial products in sound control in the near future , and we hope that this paper will aid in accelerating progress in this regard .",
