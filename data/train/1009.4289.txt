    "topological insulators ( tis ) have been recognized as novel states of quantum matter.@xcite they are of tremendous interest to both fundamental condensed matter physics and potential applications in spintronics as well as quantum computing .",
    "tis are insulating in the bulk which is usually due to direct bulk band gaps .",
    "however , on the boundary there are topologically protected gapless surface or edge states . usually in these materials",
    "the spin orbital coupling is very strong such that the conduction band and valence band are inverted .",
    "such phenomena have already been reported in the literature of the 1980s.@xcite however , the topological nature behind these phenomena was not revealed at the time . with the recent development of topological band theories , a series of materials including hgte quantum well , bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , bi@xmath2se@xmath3 , and bi@xmath2te@xmath3 have been theoretically predicted and experimentally realized as 2d and 3d tis.@xcite the search for tis has been extended from these alloys and binary compounds to ternary compounds . very recently a large family of materials namely the heusler - related and li - based intermetallic ternary compounds have been predicted to be promising 3d tis through first principle calculations.@xcite the enormous variety in these compounds provides wide options for future material synthesizing of tis .",
    "however , despite an insulating bulk is a critical prerequisite to the ti theory , none of these newly found materials are naturally band insulators .",
    "many of them are semi - metals or even metals .",
    "it has been shown that the band structure and band topology of many of these compounds closely resemble that of the zinc blende structure binary compound hgte and cdte .",
    "@xcite    in this work we study the evolution of surface states in these topologically non - trivial compounds whose band structure closely resemble 3d hgte by means of the 6-band kane model . by studying the local density of states ( ldos ) on the material boundary , we demonstrate explicitly the existence of surface states in the direct band gap .",
    "furthermore , we show that in the strain free condition , the surface states are separated into two parts in the band structure .",
    "one part exists in the direct band gap , the other part of surface states ( including the crossing point of dirac cone ) submerge in the valence bands .",
    "the latter surface states have distinct momentum dependent spatial distribution from the former . by applying uniaxial strains ,",
    "the crossing point can be raised up into the strain induced insulating gap . in the thin films made of these materials ,",

    "3d hgte and cdte share the same zinc blende structure .",
    "the band topology of these two materials is distinguished by the band inversion at the @xmath6 -point , which happens in hgte but not cdte .",
    "this causes hgte to be topologically nontrivial while cdte is trivial.@xcite the essential electronic properties of both are solely determined by the band structure near the fermi surface at @xmath6-point , where the bands possess @xmath7 ( @xmath8 type , doubly degenerate ) , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 type , @xmath11 , quadruply degenerate ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath10 type , @xmath13 , doubly degenerate ) symmetry.@xcite the band inversion in hgte takes place because the @xmath7 bands appear below the @xmath9 band , whereas in the normal case ( such as cdte ) @xmath7 is above @xmath9 ( see fig 1).@xcite in this work , we use a 6-band kane model hamiltonian which takes into account the @xmath7 and @xmath9 band .",
    "the spin - orbit split off @xmath12 band usually appears far below the @xmath7 and @xmath9 bands and hence can be neglected because it does nt affect the low energy approximation .",

    "when @xmath38 the band structure is inverted @xmath5 appears below lh and hh . in this case , the system is semi - metal since the bulk band gap @xmath39 is always 0 because of the lh / hh degeneracy .",
    "we will show this semi - metal is topologically non - trivial by that gapless surface states exists in the direct gap of lh and hh . and",
    "by lifting the degeneracy of lh and hh by strain or finite confinement which makes @xmath39 non - zero , the system instantly becomes a topological insulator .",
    "whereas in trivial semi - metals , lifting the zero band gap only turns the systems into trivial band insulators .    to study the topological properties of this hamiltonian we transform it into a tight - binding model on a cubic lattice , where such approximation substitutions are used : @xmath40 here @xmath41 refers to @xmath18 and @xmath42 , a is the lattice constant which is taken to be 4  in this work .",

    "we find that these states indeed reside only on the surface boundary ( see fig .",

    "interestingly , we also find another kind of surface state submerging in the valence bands ( bright regions in the valence band of fig .",
    "it shows up between the inverted @xmath7 and hh @xmath9 bands .",
    "we confirm its surface state nature by checking its spatial distribution along the z direction ( fig . 3b and 3c ) .",
    "it is found that the spatial distribution of this surface state has very distinct form from that between the lh and hh bands .",
    "it bears the oscillating feature of ldos of bulk states ( see fig .",
    "3d ) but is also clearly decaying beneath the surface .",
    "we call the former surface state as the first type and the latter the second type . both types of surface state project much larger ldos on the surface than the bulk states . however , the first type surface state is clearly decoupled from the bulk states while the second type is coupled with the valence bulk conduction states .",
    "the spatial distribution can be obtained by enlarging the super cell when calculating the surface green s function @xmath45 .",
    "for example , take the first 50 layers as a unit cell , we can obtain the ldos distribution in the first 50 layers .",
    "3a shows the spatial distribution of the first type surface state at variant @xmath50 .",
    "it shows that the closer to the @xmath6 point the wider it distributes in space . only away from the @xmath33 point , it showes strong localization on the surface . close to the @xmath6 point , its distribution is bulk like and can barely be recognized as surface state . in fig .",
    "2 the bright line indicating first type surface has been highlighted for a clearer view .",
    "the fermi surface of 3d hgte is close to the point where the conduction band touches the valence band.@xcite the first type surface states at the fermi surface distribute widely in the space .",
    "they are expected to make no significant contribution to the transport properties either . without appropriate doping or gating",
    "it is difficult to detect the first type surface states in 3d hgte experimentally either through angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) or transport measurements .",
    "unlike the first type surface states which show up as well defined sharp lines in the energy spectrum , the second type surface states appear as two crossing bright regions submerging in the valence bands in the energy spectrum .",
    "it appears near the boundary of the @xmath7 band . at the crossing point , it is the sharpest , above the crossing point , it is broadened into two wide tails .",
    "close to the @xmath6 point , its ldos on the surface is the highest .",
    "away from the @xmath6 point , the surface ldos becomes smaller and finally those states merge into the bulk states . also unlike the first type surface state",
    "whose distribution width becomes very large when approaching the @xmath6 point , its distribution width in space does not significantly depend on the momentum . at the @xmath33 point ,",
    "the second type surface state energy and wave function is exactly solvable from the hamiltonian .",
    "we will show that this point is the crossing point of the surface state dirac cone.(see text below ) beneath the surface , the ldos quickly decays in an oscillatory way . for comparison ,",
    "we also plot out the bulk states ldos which is oscillatory and extended all over the space without decaying ( fig .",
