    "the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) is a 13-element radio interferometer array designed to image the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and measure its angular power spectrum in the 2636 ghz frequency band .",
    "the power of accurate measurements of the cmb power spectrum to constrain cosmological models and obtain precise estimates of critical cosmological parameters has been demonstrated by many theoretical and observational studies .",
    "the most recent experiments  the boomerang @xcite and maxima @xcite balloon - borne bolometers and the dasi interferometer array at the south pole @xcite  have measured the power spectrum at multipoles @xmath11 ( angular scales @xmath12 ) .",
    "the cbi has the potential to extend these measurements to @xmath13 .",
    "this paper is the third in a series reporting results from the cbi .",
    "preliminary results were presented by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) . the accompanying paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper ii ) presents our estimate of the power spectrum for @xmath14 from observations of three pairs of @xmath15 ( fwhm ) deep fields made in our first observing season , 2000 january  december .",
    "the present paper ( paper iii ) presents complementary results from first - season observations of three pairs of mosaic fields each about @xmath16 ( total @xmath17  deg@xmath0 ) , using the mosaicing method .",
    "these observations have higher resolution in @xmath10 than those of paper ii , and they have greater sensitivity at low @xmath10 owing to the reduced cosmic variance , but they are less sensitive at high @xmath10 .",
    "further observations made in 2001 , which are currently being analyzed , will increase the sensitivity and improve the resolution of our power spectrum estimate .",
    "the method we use for extracting power spectrum estimates from interferometry data is described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  iv ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : cbi ] we summarize the important properties of the cbi and introduce the mosaic technique . in   [ sec : obs ] we describe the observations that are presented in this paper and present images of the three pairs of mosaic fields . in   [ sec : ps ] we describe the maximum - likelihood method for estimating the power spectrum from visibility measurements and present our power - spectrum estimates .",
    "we pay particular attention to the contaminating effects of foreground point sources . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : concl ] we discuss some of the implications of our results and summarize our conclusions . a full discussion of the implications for cosmology will be the subject of two further papers ( @xcite , hereafter paper  v ; @xcite , hereafter paper  vi ) .",
    "theoretical models of the cmb predict its angular power spectrum , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the coefficients in a spherical - harmonic expansion of the cmb temperature distribution as a function of direction @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22  k is the mean cmb temperature @xcite .",
    "the angle brackets indicate the expectation value ( ensemble average ) . in this paper , as in most work , the quantity presented in the figures is the power per unit logarithmic interval in @xmath10 , @xmath23 scaled by @xmath24 to put it in temperature units ( @xmath25k@xmath0 ) .",
    "measurement of the cmb power spectrum with interferometers has been discussed in several papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "a single - baseline interferometer is sensitive to a range of multipoles @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the baseline length in wavelengths , and @xmath28 is the fwhm of the visibility window function , which is proportional to the square of the fourier transform of the primary beam ( antenna power pattern ) . for a circular gaussian primary beam of fwhm @xmath29 rad , @xmath30 .",
    "the cbi is a 13 element interferometer in which all 78 antenna pairs are cross - correlated ( for a detailed description , see @xcite ) .",
    "its 2636  ghz band is split into ten channels each 1  ghz wide , which are correlated separately , giving a total of 780 complex visibility measurements in each integration .",
    "the antennas are arranged with a common axis on a flat platform .",
    "the platform mount is steered in altitude and azimuth so that all the antennas track the same point on the celestial sphere ; in addition , the platform is rotated about the axis to track parallactic angle , so that each baseline keeps a constant orientation relative to the field of view .",
    "the 78 baselines range in length from 1.0  m to about 5.5  m , depending on the antenna configuration on the platform . during the observations reported here",
    ", we used several different configurations .",
    "the antennas respond to left circular polarization ( lcp ) , although for part of the observations one antenna was configured for right circular polarization ( rcp ) .",
    "data from the 12 cross - polarized baselines have not been used for this paper , but they will be used to place limits on cmb polarization ( j. k. cartwright et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the cbi cassegrain antennas have a diameter of 0.90  m and a measured primary beam width @xmath31 at frequency @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 .",
    "the primary beam is quite close to a circular gaussian , but we have adopted a more accurate model of the radial profile ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : beam ] ) and used this model when making images and estimating the cmb power spectrum .    in observations from a single pointing ( as in paper  i and paper  ii ) ,",
    "the resolution in @xmath10 of the power spectrum is limited to @xmath34 , which is insufficient to resolve the expected structure in the spectrum . to improve the resolution in @xmath10 ,",
    "which is inversely proportional to the angular size of the imaged region , we make _ mosaiced _ observations in which we map a larger area of sky using several closely - spaced pointings .",
    "this method is in widespread use for making images of extended regions with radio interferometers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the observations reported here , we mapped three separate mosaic fields in this way , using 42 pointings for each in a rectangular grid of 7 rows separated by @xmath35 in declination and 6 columns separated by @xmath36 in right ascension .",
    "this allows us to improve the resolution in @xmath10 to @xmath37 .",
    "although the cbi antennas were designed to have low sidelobes and crosstalk @xcite , emission from the ground contaminates the data , especially on short baselines ( @xcite ; paper  i ; paper  ii ) .",
    "the ground signal is stable on time - scales of many minutes , so if we observe two nearby fields under similar ground conditions , the difference of the visibilities of the two fields is unaffected by the ground .",
    "differencing also eliminates any constant or slowly varying instrumental offsets .",
    "we observe a field ( the _ lead _ field ) for about 8  min and then switch to a reference field ( _ trail _ field ) , at the same declination but 8  min later in right ascension , for the next 8  min , and form the difference of corresponding @xmath38  s integrations .",
    "one such `` scan '' consists of up to 50 differenced integrations , the exact number depending on how much time is lost to slewing and calibration .",
    "the two fields are observed over the same range of azimuth and elevation , so they have nearly identical ground contributions .",
    "all the results presented in this paper are derived from the differenced visibilities .",
    "the images show the difference of intensity between a region of sky and one 8  min later in right ascension ; and the differencing is included in the covariance matrices used for power - spectrum estimation .    for each pointing",
    "incorporated in the mosaics we obtained approximately 16 such 8  min _ lead - trail _ scans , although the exact number varied from one pointing to another . between scans , we rotated the platform to change its orientation relative to the hour circle , thus improving the sampling of the @xmath39 plane is the separation of a pair of antennas , measured in wavelengths ( @xmath40 ) , in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the center of the field of view , i.e. , in the plane of the rotating antenna platform . ] .",
    "this also reduces the effect of any residual ground contamination : the ground signal does not add coherently when the visibilities from different baselines measuring the same @xmath39 point are combined , because the antennas have different far sidelobe responses .",
    "an example of the @xmath39 plane sampling obtained for a single pointing is shown in figure  [ fig : uvplot ] .",
    "no attempt was made to obtain identical sampling for all the pointings .",
    "in this paper we present observations of three mosaic fields ( identified as 02 , 14 , and 20 ) separated by about 6  in right ascension at a declination of about @xmath41 .",
    "the fields were chosen to have iras 100  @xmath25 m emission less than 1  mjy@xmath42sr@xmath43 , low synchrotron emission , and no point sources brighter than a few hundred mjy at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "details of the fields observed are given in table  [ tab : fields ] .",
    "two of the individual pointings comprising our mosaics have been observed to much greater depth , and our data for these two pointings are a subset of the data analyzed in paper  ii .",
    "data acquisition , calibration , and editing were performed in the manner described in paper  ii ; we give only a summary here .",
    "observations were made at elevations @xmath44 , at night , and more than @xmath45 from the moon .",
    "the amplitude scale was based on nightly observations of calibration sources ( jupiter , saturn , tau  a [ 3c  144 , the crab nebula ] , and vir  a [ 3c  274 ] ) ; the primary calibrator was jupiter , for which we assumed an effective temperature of @xmath46  k at 32  ghz @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the overall calibration uncertainty is @xmath47 rms , equivalent to @xmath48 in cmb power .",
    "a small fraction of the data were discarded owing to instrumental problems .",
    "most of these problems were detected by real - time monitoring of the receivers ; a few hardware problems in the correlators were indicated by unusually high correlation between the real and imaginary parts of the visibility .",
    "a few nights were affected by bad weather , and we deleted all data taken at times when atmospheric noise was visible on the short baselines .",
    "as mentioned above , all the data were taken in pairs of 8  min scans on a _",
    "lead _ and a _ trail _ field , separated by 8 min in ra .",
    "the field separation on the sky varied with declination , but for our declinations , @xmath49 , it was very close to @xmath50 .",
    "individual 8.4  s integrations in the two scans were matched in hour angle and differenced , and unmatched integrations were discarded .",
    "we estimated the noise in each scan from the rms of the differenced integrations , and compared it with the expected rms noise level in either the real or imaginary visibility : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath53 is the system temperature , @xmath54 is the effective area of each antenna , @xmath55 is the correlator efficiency , @xmath56 is the channel bandwidth , and @xmath57 is the integration time @xcite . under good conditions the measured noise ,",
    "@xmath58 jy  s@xmath59 , is consistent with the estimated system temperature @xmath60  k. the rms noise in the differenced data should be @xmath61 .",
    "when the rms exceeded 2.6 times the expected rms , we discarded the entire scan - pair .",
    "this eliminated almost all of the data affected by the atmosphere . a final visibility estimate for each channel of each baseline in each orientation of the antenna platform was computed by a weighted average of the individual scan visibilities , and the uncertainty in this estimate was computed from the scan rms s , taking into account a bias introduced by the fact that the scan rms s are themselves estimated from the data ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "the final edited and calibrated dataset is summarized in table  [ tab : fields ] , which reports the total integration time ( averaged over baselines ) on each of the lead and trail fields comprising the mosaics .",
    "owing to the vagaries of the weather and the telescope , some fields were observed to greater depths than others , and a few were missed altogether ; this is reflected in the variation of sensitivity across each mosaic ( see   [ sec : images ] ) .      in the 2636  ghz band ,",
    "the dominant confusing foreground is the emission from discrete radio galaxies and quasars , which we refer to as `` point sources '' ( they are virtually unresolved by the cbi ) . the contribution of point sources to the visibilities must be removed in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "a random distribution of point sources has a power spectrum @xmath62 , while for the cmb @xmath63 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath10 , so discrete sources dominate at high  @xmath10 .    to remove most of the point - source contamination in our data",
    ", we measured the flux densities of a large number of known point sources in the mosaic fields using a new dual - beam 31  ghz hemt receiver with a beamwidth of @xmath64 on the 40-meter telescope at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) .",
    "the observations followed standard methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; details will be presented elsewhere ( b. s. mason et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a total of 2225 sources brighter than 6  mjy at 1.4  ghz in the nrao vla 1.4 ghz sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) were observed , as described in paper  ii .",
    "for each source detected above a @xmath65 threshold , the expected visibility ( assuming a point source at the nvss position with the ovro flux density attenuated by the cbi primary beam ) was subtracted from the cbi visibility data .",
    "the survey is 90% complete for @xmath66  mjy and 99% complete for @xmath67  mjy .",
    "a total of 70 sources were subtracted from the 02  data , 63 from the 14  data , and 68 from the 20  data .",
    "to estimate the response in each cbi frequency channel , we used the two - point spectral index @xmath68 ( 1.431  ghz ) for steep - spectrum sources ( @xmath69 where @xmath70 ) and an average spectral index @xmath71 for the remainder , which may be variable ; but as we are only extrapolating @xmath72 in frequency the results are not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath68 .    by making images before and after source subtraction ( see   [ sec : images ] ) we have verified that the cbi and ovro measurements are consistent .",
    "the resulting images are dominated by the cmb . however , source subtraction is not sufficient for accurate power - spectrum estimation , because there may be small residuals and there will also be unmeasured sources that have not been accounted for .",
    "when estimating the cmb power spectrum , we have adopted a more powerful method than source subtraction : we have projected out the known point sources ( following @xcite ) ( see   [ sec : sources ] ) .",
    "although we subtracted the sources measured at ovro , we also projected them out , so errors in the ovro flux - density measurements should not affect the power spectrum estimates .",
    "the quantity of primary cosmological interest , the power spectrum , is best estimated directly from the visibility data , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ps ] below .",
    "however , we can also make images of the cmb ( convolved with the instrumental point - spread function ) by fourier - transforming the visibilities .",
    "the images provide a good check for the presence of non - gaussian features in the cmb or instrumental errors in the data , such as calibration errors ( which would show up as residuals after point - source subtraction ) .",
    "we have used standard aperture - synthesis techniques @xcite to make images from each pointing .",
    "the images are formed from linear combinations of the measured visibilities and we have not done any deconvolution or `` cleaning . ''",
    "the `` dirty '' image @xmath73 is the fourier transform of the sampled visibilities , @xmath74                                 -v_k^i \\sin[2\\pi{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$u$}}}_k\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$ } } } ] \\right\\ }               \\over \\sum_k w_k } , \\ ] ] and is the convolution of @xmath75 ( the primary beam response times the sky brightness ) with the point - spread function or dirty beam @xmath76 : @xmath77               \\over \\sum_k w_k } .\\ ] ] in practice , we resample the visibilities on a grid and use an fft to compute the image and beam using standard software @xcite .",
    "the sky coordinates @xmath20 are the fourier conjugates to the baseline components @xmath78 and correspond to direction cosines relative to the pointing center .",
    "the weights @xmath79 are usually chosen to be the statistical weights ( `` natural weighting '' ) , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the standard deviation of the real or imaginary part of the complex visibility , estimated as described above . with this weighting ,",
    "the variance of the dirty image is @xmath82 ^ 2}\\rangle = { 1\\over\\sum_k \\sigma_k^{-2}}.\\ ] ]    a `` linear '' mosaic image @xmath83 is formed from several pointings by shifting each dirty image to a common phase center , correcting it for its primary beam , and making a weighted sum at each pixel : @xmath84 the weighted mean gives a maximum - likelihood estimate if the weights are equal to the inverse variances of the corrected images , i.e. , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the variance of the dirty image made from the @xmath87th pointing .",
    "thus @xmath88 and the variance in the mosaic image is @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the variance varies across the image , and it is necessary to truncate the image where the variance becomes excessive . we have used the model for the primary beam described in the caption to figure  [ fig : beam ] , set to zero for radii @xmath90 . in making the mosaic images , and in the power spectrum analysis described below , we have made the approximation that the sky is flat over the @xmath91 image , which is equivalent to an error of @xmath92 of phase on the longest baselines .",
    "figures [ fig : mos02][fig : mos20lr ] show mosaic images made from the cbi data .",
    "we can make a variety of different images by selecting different subsets of the data and adjusting the weights @xmath79 .",
    "figures [ fig : mos02 ] , [ fig : mos14 ] , and [ fig : mos20 ] show mosaic images made from the entire dataset using natural weighting , and similar images made from the visibility data after subtraction of the point sources measured at ovro .",
    "figure [ fig : noise ] shows the variation of noise level across these images , and indicates the pointing centers .",
    "the effectiveness of the ovro source subtraction can be seen by comparison of the `` before '' and `` after '' images .",
    "most of the sources have been removed successfully , although there are of course residuals owing to measurement errors or source variability , and a few sources can be seen that were not detected at ovro ( these sources were projected out in the power spectrum analysis ) .    to investigate the sources further",
    ", we have made higher - resolution images ( not shown ) using only baselines longer than 250@xmath40 , and searched for peaks exceeding @xmath93 in images of signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "all these peaks are coincident within @xmath94 with sources that have @xmath95  mjy in the nvss catalog . of the 42 sources detected ,",
    "37 are identified with nvss sources with @xmath96  mjy which were detected at ovro .",
    "the remaining five objects are associated with nvss sources that were not detected at ovro ; one of them , with @xmath97  mjy , was not observed at ovro . as we reported in paper",
    "ii , we find that the number @xmath98 of sources greater than flux density @xmath99 at 31  ghz is @xmath100 for @xmath101  mjy .",
    "we use this result in   [ sec : sources ] to estimate the contribution to our power spectra of sources below @xmath102  mjy ( stronger sources are treated individually ) .",
    "figures [ fig : mos02lr ] , [ fig : mos14lr ] , and [ fig : mos20lr ] show lower - resolution images made by reducing the weight of long baselines with a gaussian taper ; this suppresses the high - frequency noise and emphasizes the cmb emission .",
    "these figures include images made from the upper and lower halves of the cbi frequency band .",
    "there is good visual correspondence between the two halves of the band ; but note that the spatial - frequency sampling is not the same in the two halves , so a quantitative comparison is difficult .",
    "the visual agreement is echoed in the good agreement between the power spectra obtained from the two halves of the band ( see   [ sec : sub_by_freq ] ) .",
    "these low - resolution images are dominated by sky signal rather than noise .",
    "note , however , that the images are differences of two sky patches , and they are also missing the lowest spatial frequencies , so a comparison with images obtained with another instrument may be difficult . by inspection of signal - to - noise ratio images ( computed using eqs .",
    "[ eq : mosaic ] and [ eq : noise ] ) made from subsets of the data , we have found that signals corresponding to @xmath11 are detected with high significance ( @xmath103 ) , and there are some significant detections of individual features at higher @xmath10 .",
    "the detected features range in angular size from @xmath2 to @xmath104 , corresponding to mass scales at the surface of last scattering of @xmath105 to @xmath106 , so these features are likely to be the seeds that would evolve into clusters of galaxies by the present epoch .",
    "our algorithm for the estimation of power spectra from mosaic visibility data is described in paper  iv .",
    "we model the power spectrum as flat in each of a set of @xmath107 contiguous bands , i.e. , @xmath108 ( with @xmath109 ) , and take the _ band - powers _",
    "@xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) as a set of unknown parameters to be determined by maximizing the likelihood ( the probability of obtaining the measured visibilities , if the model were correct , for given values of the parameters ) .",
    "if the signal and noise obey gaussian statistics , which we assume , the likelihood is given by the multivariate gaussian distribution for _ complex _ variates , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a column vector containing the complex visibility measurements , @xmath114 ( a function of the parameters @xmath110 ) is the covariance matrix of the visibilities , and @xmath115 denotes the hermitian conjugate .",
    "( although eq .",
    "[ [ eq : like ] ] is expressed in terms of complex visibilities , it is easier in practice to treat the real and imaginary parts of the visibilities as a double - length real vector ) .    the correlation matrix @xmath116 can be written as @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the noise correlation matrix , estimated from the data as described above , @xmath119 is the cmb signal correlation matrix for band @xmath120 ( independent of @xmath110 ) , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are constraint matrices @xcite representing the effects of foreground point sources of known position , and @xmath123 represents a residual contribution from faint sources of unknown position .",
    "we discuss the source terms further in ",
    "[ sec : sources ] .",
    "the factors @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 could in principle be regarded as free parameters to be determined by maximum likelihood , but in practice they are not well determined by the data and we instead hold them fixed at _ a priori _ values .    in a typical mosaic observation ,",
    "the number of distinct visibility measurements is very large ( @xmath127 complex visibilities for a mosaic of 42 pointings with 10 frequency channels , 78 baselines , and several parallactic angles ) , which makes the covariance matrices ( eq .  [ [ eq : cvm ] ] ) impractically large .",
    "however , neighboring points in the @xmath39 plane are highly correlated and need not be treated completely independently . to reduce the size of the matrices , we interpolate the measured visibility set @xmath113 onto a smaller number of grid points in the @xmath39 plane ( so that the quantities that enter the likelihood calculation are linear combinations of the measured visibilities ) , and make the corresponding transformation of the covariance matrix . by this",
    "means we reduce the dimension of the ( real ) matrices to @xmath128 .",
    "we ran tests with different grid spacings , using both real data and simulated data , to verify that using a finer grid would not significantly change the results ( see paper  iv ) .",
    "we find the maximum likelihood solution by the quadratic relaxation technique of @xcite , which yields estimates of the band powers @xmath110 , with their covariances given by the inverse of the fisher information matrix @xmath129 we also calculate the band - power window functions and the equivalent band - powers of the noise , known point sources , and residual point sources by the methods described in paper  iv .",
    "the band - power window function @xmath130 @xcite allows the expected band - power for a given model power spectrum to be estimated as a weighted mean : @xmath131      if we had accurate measurements of all the point sources in our frequency band , we could subtract their contributions directly from the visibilities , but as we do not we must adopt a statistical approach .",
    "a detailed description of our method of dealing with point sources is presented in paper  ii , and here we give only a summary .",
    "the strongest sources ( `` ovro '' sources ) were measured at ovro and subtracted from the visibility data as described above .",
    "the subtraction was necessarily imperfect , however , and the residuals of the subtracted sources make a contribution to the power spectrum that must be removed .",
    "we created a second list of `` nvss '' sources within about @xmath132 of any of the mosaic pointing centers that were not detected at ovro but had @xmath133  mjy , which corresponds to @xmath134  mjy for a typical spectral index of @xmath135 .",
    "this list contained 960 , 918 , and 974 sources in the 02 , 14 , and 20  mosaic fields .",
    "crude estimates of the flux densities for these sources were subtracted from the visibilities as part of the power - spectrum estimation .",
    "for each mosaic , we constructed two constraint matrices , @xmath136 and @xmath122 , using the positions and estimated residual flux - density uncertainties of the sources in the two lists . in principle , if our error estimates were correct , the constraint matrices would fully account for the source contributions and should be included in the maximum likelihood analysis with prefactors @xmath137 .",
    "however , after some experimentation , we decided to err on the side of caution and use large prefactors , @xmath138 , to give very low weight to modes that are affected by these known sources ( much larger factors cause the covariance matrix to be ill - conditioned ) .",
    "this is equivalent to marginalizing over the unknown flux densities , or `` projecting out '' the sources @xcite .",
    "our analysis is thus insensitive to errors in the assumed flux densities of the sources , but at the cost of some loss in sensitivity ( see paper iv ) .",
    "sources that are not included in the known - source lists also contribute power .",
    "we estimate the visibility covariance arising from such sources and include it as the residual source term @xmath123 .",
    "the radio source counts and spectra used to compute this term are described in paper  ii . as in that paper , we estimate that , for an nvss flux - density cutoff at @xmath139  mjy , the amplitude of the residual correction is @xmath140  jy@xmath0  sr@xmath43 ( see paper  iv ) .",
    "the dividing line between known sources and sources included in the residual term is somewhat arbitrary , so long as the residual term is computed correctly for the chosen flux - density cutoff .",

    "figure  [ fig : jointps200 ] shows two theoretical spectra for minimal inflation - based models with different parameters . as we discuss in paper  v ,",
    "we have evaluated the posterior probabilities of the cbi and other datasets over a grid of models in a 7-dimensional parameter space , using a variety of prior probabilities based on hubble constant , large - scale - structure , and supernova - ia observations .",
    "the first model displayed in figure  [ fig : jointps200 ] is the model that maximizes the posterior probability of the cbi mosaic ( using the `` odd '' @xmath153 binning ) and _ cobe_-dmr results , with the weak-@xmath159 prior on the hubble constant ; within the grid of models , this is also the best fit if we restrict the search to flat models .",

    "the agreement is very good .",
    "a detailed comparison will be made in paper  v.    we have also computed the power spectrum of the three mosaics using the wider bins chosen for analyzing the cbi deep field data ( paper  ii ) .",

    "but if we ignore this complication , we can compare the two sets of band - powers by a chi - squared test , using the band - power covariance matrices .",
    "for this test , we assume that the likelihood function is approximately gaussian and compute @xmath164 where @xmath165 are the band - power estimates and @xmath166 are the inverse fisher matrices for the two datasets . omitting the first and last bins , we find @xmath167 , with 5 degrees of freedom . if the two data sets were drawn from the same population , a larger value would be obtained in 35% of trials , so we conclude that the two data sets are consistent . at @xmath168 , where the deep observations show a significant signal , the mosaic observations are less sensitive than the deep and are consistent both with the deep result and with no signal . in the bin @xmath169 , we find @xmath170 @xmath25k@xmath0 in the mosaics and @xmath171 @xmath25k@xmath0 in the deep fields .",

    "the maximum - likelihood values of @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 are determined by @xmath183 , but the errors in these transformed variables are non - gaussian .",

    "there are more detections in the odd binning than in the even binning , which is an indication that even the @xmath153 bin size is larger than we would like for effective peak / bin detection . in the odd binning",
    ", we detect four peaks , at @xmath192 , and four dips , at @xmath193 .",
    "the significance levels of the peaks , expressed as @xmath194 , are 2.1 , 2.6 , 1.8 , and 1.7 , and those of the dips are 2.3 , 2.4 , 1.5 , and 2.3 .",
    "the two peaks and two dips detected with the even binning show good agreement with those detected with the odd binning .",
    "maximum - likelihood values for the subthreshold even - binned detections ( with curvature @xmath195 ) are in good accord with the odd - binned detections .",
    "thus we have tentative detections of the second , third , fourth , and fifth acoustic peaks . with this dataset , even @xmath153 is barely fine enough to resolve the peaks , but we should be able to do better when we include the second season of cbi data .",
    "a second approach to peak / dip detection was also used by @xcite : given a class of theoretical models with a sequence of peaks and dips , the statistical distribution of positions and amplitudes can be predicted by ensemble - averaging over the full probability , the multidimensional likelihood .",
    "we have used the same @xmath196-database as @xcite , which is also the one we have used for cosmological parameter estimation in paper  v. figure  [ fig : peaksdips ] shows the peaks and dips we `` predict '' from boomerang , dasi , maxima , _ cobe _ dmr and 19 other experiments predating this cbi dataset .",
    "the errors on the positions and heights determined this way are relatively small , comparable to the size of the symbols plotted . within this set of minimal inflation - based models ,",
    "the positions and amplitudes of the higher-@xmath10 peaks are largely determined by the positions and amplitudes of the first few .",
    "it can be seen that the values found using our model - independent quadratic peak / dip - finder are in excellent agreement with the predictions for @xmath197 . at higher @xmath10 , perhaps there is a shift of peak placement , but we caution that our peak - position error bars , being derived from a fisher matrix determined at the maximum likelihood , are only approximate . adding cbi to the rest of the pre - cbi experiments gives peak positions and amplitudes in good accord with those shown here , and indeed so does using just dmr and the cbi data .",

    "the chi - squared test ( eq .  [ [ eq : chisq ] ] ) shows that the 02  and 14  mosaics are consistent with each other , but the 20  mosaic is discrepant at the 95% confidence level in the odd binning ( see table  [ tab : chisq ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : indivps ] shows that most of the discrepancy occurs in two adjacent bins at @xmath198 .",
    "it is unlikely that this reflects a real change in the cmb spectrum with direction , or that it could arise from , for example , foreground contamination in the 20  mosaic , so we provisionally attribute the discrepancy to a chance statistical fluctuation .",

    ". we will be able to examine the question of field - to - field consistency more closely when we have analyzed data from the 2001 observing season , which extend the sky coverage by a factor of two .",
    "a second consistency check is to compare the power spectra obtained from the different cbi frequency channels . as in ",
    "[ sec : images ] , we have divided the data into low- and high - frequency halves ( 2631 and 3136 ghz ) . the results are shown in figure  [ fig : joint_bychan ] . if the signal is due primarily to the cmb , the two spectra should be consistent , but if there is a large contribution from a non - thermal foreground , such as synchrotron , free - free , or dust emission , they should be different .",
    "the two spectra are similar , but it is difficult to make a quantitative comparison owing to the strong correlation between the two frequency bands .",
    "the error estimates obtained from the fisher matrix include the contribution of cosmic variance as well as the measurement noise , so they overestimate the band - to - band variance .",
    "the results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of interferometric mosaicing both for imaging the cmb and for measuring its power spectrum .",
    "the cbi images show for the first time structures in the cmb on mass - scales corresponding to clusters of galaxies , and the cmb power spectrum has been extended by more than a factor of two in multipole number @xmath10 .",
    "although the resolution in @xmath10 is limited ( we will obtain better resolution when we analyze the wider - field observations made in 2001 ) , we have been able to detect the second and third acoustic peaks in the spectrum , and , for the first time , the fourth and possibly the fifth .",
    "the deeper observations reported in paper  ii extend the spectrum even further , well into the damping tail region where secondary anisotropies become important ( see paper vi ) .",
    "ground - based observations of the cmb in the 1-cm wave - band , where long integrations can be obtained , are competitive with balloon - based observations at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the principal obstacle to observations in this band , particularly at high @xmath10 , is the emission from foreground point sources .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to correct the observations for this contamination with high accuracy , at a cost in sensitivity , but foreground sources remain the largest source of uncertainty in the power spectrum . to improve on our result",
    ", we will need sensitive high - resolution surveys of the foreground sources at 31 ghz , such as will soon be possible with the nrao green bank telescope .",
    "it should be clear from figures  [ fig : jointps200 ] and [ fig : compare ] that the cbi results are consistent with earlier observations in the region @xmath197 .",
    "what is more remarkable is that at higher @xmath10 , a region that has not been probed before , the results are consistent with extrapolations of the power spectrum based on simple inflation - motivated models .",
    "we show in paper v that the major cosmological parameters ( the total density parameter , the density parameters for baryonic and non - baryonic matter , the primordial density perturbation spectral index , the hubble constant , the cosmological constant , and the optical depth to last scattering ) are well constrained by the cbi observations , even when only the region of the spectrum beyond the first two peaks is considered .",
    "this provides further strong support for cosmological models dominated by cold dark matter and dark energy , and with a scale - invariant spectrum of primordial density fluctuations up to @xmath202 .",
    "the corresponding angular scales and masses are @xmath203 and @xmath204 , the scale of galaxy clusters .",
    "this provides a firm foundation for theories of galaxy formation .",
    "a second season of cbi mosaic observations were obtained in 2001 , and are currently being analyzed .",
