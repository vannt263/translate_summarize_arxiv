    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) started out as an approach to non - perturbative quantization of the gravitational field using a classical canonical formulation of gravity as a starting point @xcite .",
    "the ( spatial ) diffeomorphism invariance of the theory guaranteed a pretty kinematical framework with a tight analytic control rarely seen in four - dimensional quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "the initial attempts at a formulation of the dynamics ( via implementation of the hamiltonian constraint ) were very promising . in the mid - nineties thiemann proposed a quantization of the euclidean as well as the lorentzian hamiltonian constraint in a series of remarkable papers titled quantum spin dynamics @xcite .",
    "thiemann s hamiltonian constraint had some rather intriguing properties like uv finiteness . however , despite this initial promise the hamiltonian constraint program in canonical loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) has reached a strange impasse .",
    "several issues still remain open and in our opinion it is hard to argue against an assertion that there is no satisfactory definition of hamiltonian constraint in canonical lqg .",
    "[ for some very interesting recent progress in this direction we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "] this impasse has in turn led to new avenues to analyze the dynamics in lqg , e.g. the master constraint program @xcite , the covariant spin - foam models ( for reviews , see @xcite ) , and the deparametrized dust models @xcite .",
    "there are two primary reasons for the above assertion . on one hand",
    "there is no unique definition of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "quantization of hamiltonian constraint in lqg involves ( just as for any composite operator in any quantum field theory ) an intermediate choice of regularization .",
    "this regularization amounts to choosing a family of loops , edges , surfaces and certain discrete representation theoretic labels from which a regularized hamiltonian constraint operator is built .",
    "there are an infinite number of choices for each of the regulating structures involved and in principle each such choice can give rise to a distinct operator which is well defined on the kinematical hilbert space of lqg , @xmath2 .",
    "this would not be a problem if the continuum limit of the regularized constraint was independent of the regulating structures involved .",
    "however this is not the case and even the continuum hamiltonian has an infinite dimensional parameter worth of ambiguity.as the hamiltonian constraint in canonical gravity is a generator of the so called dirac algebra , a priori one might expect that as we require the quantum hamiltonian constraint to be anomaly - free ( in the sense that there exist a representation of the dirac algebra in quantum theory ) , there will be certain non - trivial restrictions on the quantization choices mentioned above .",
    "however as it turns out , this is not quite true .",
    "anomaly freedom is achieved in lqg through what is known in gauge theories as an on - shell closure .",
    "( that is we require both the left and the right hand sides of constraint algebra to trivialize on states that are solution to ( at least some of ) the constraints ) and this condition barely places any restrictions on the quantization ambiguities which infect the definition of the constraint .",
    "even more worryingly there are some very concrete signs that this trivialization of the right hand side and left hand side of dirac algebra might even extend to states which in a precise sense are not on - shell , thus indicating some serious problems with the definition of the quantum constraint.in this paper , we analyze the issue in a simple three - dimensional diffeomorphism - invariant gauge theory with abelian gauge group @xmath0 ( to the best of our knowledge this model was first conceived by smolin in four space - time dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to quantize the hamiltonian constraint of the theory ( in loop formulation ) such that it has a chance to generate an anomaly - free dirac algebra in the quantum theory . in the next section ,",
    "we outline the problem with thiemann s hamiltonian constraint in more detail and outline the work done in this paper .",
    "in this section we explain the problems with thiemann s hamiltonian constraint that we referred to in the introduction .",
    "the underlying issues are rather involved and we may not be able to do justice to different points of view which exist in the literature .",
    "we refer the reader to ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) for more details .",
    "traditionally the continuum hamiltonian constraint operator is a densely defined operator on @xmath2 .",
    "this is accomplished by placing a rather unusual topology ( referred to as the urs topology ) on the space of operators in which convergence of the one parameter family of finite triangulation hamiltonian constraint operators tuned out to be an operator on @xmath2 . roughly speaking",
    "this topology was such that limit points of any two operator sequences ( indexed by finite triangulation @xmath3 ) @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are such that @xmath6 for some @xmath7 ( @xmath8 being the unitary representation of diffeomorphism group on @xmath9 ) and for some @xmath10 , are identified .",
    "that is in this topology @xmath11.in this topology the commutator of two ( continuum ) hamiltonian constraints @xmath12,\\hat { h}[m]$ ] on @xmath2 vanishes .",
    "as shown in @xcite , there exists a quantization ( at finite triangulation ) of the right hand side of the poisson bracket relation ( see section [ classytheory])@xmath13,h[m]\\}=v[\\vec{\\omega}]\\label{eq : hhbracket}\\ ] ] which is of the form @xmath14 , whence its continuum limit in the urs topology is zero .",
    "thus the quantization of both the left and right hand sides of ( [ eq : hhbracket ] ) vanish .",
    "although this was originally taken to be a sign of internal consistency and anomaly freedom , a closer look at the structural aspects of the computation was performed in a series of remarkable papers by gambini , lewandowski , marolf , and pullin ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "they looked at the convergence of the finite - triangulation commutator sequence not on @xmath15 but on certain distributional spaces ( which are extensions of the space of diffeomorphism - invariant distributions ) referred to as habitats .",
    "as the habitat consists of ( distributional ) states which are not diffeomorphism - invariant , a priori neither the quantization of the lhs or rhs of ( [ eq : hhbracket ] ) is expected to be a trivial operator . however , it turned out that @xmath16,h[m]\\}}$ ] is the zero operator on the habitat , and there exists a quantization of @xmath17 $ ] at finite triangulation on @xmath2 whose continuum limit on the habitat is trivial . however , this vanishing of the quantization of both the rhs and lhs of ( [ eq : hhbracket ] ) on diffeomorphism non - invariant states is rather unsatisfactory .",
    "even more worrysome , the reasons for the vanishing of the lhs and rhs are entirely different .",
    "the most transparent way to see this is given in @xcite , where the authors argue that , if instead of working with density weight one constraints , one works with higher density constraints , but keeps the quantization choices essentially the same , then on their habitat , the lhs will continue to vanish , but the rhs will not , whence suggesting the presence of an anomaly in the whole scheme ( we come back to this point in more detail below ) .",
    "success of the canonical loop quantum gravity program is defined by the following : starting with the ( unique ) diffeomorphism - covariant representation of the holonomy - flux algebra , does there exist a vector space @xmath18 ( whose elements are linear combinations of spin network states ) that is a representation space for the dirac algebra , in the sense that @xmath19,\\hat{h}[m]\\right ]   \\psi &   = \\hat{v}[\\vec{\\omega}]\\psi\\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{u}(\\phi)\\hat{h}[n]\\hat{u}(\\phi^{-1})\\psi &   = \\hat{h}[\\phi^{\\ast}n]\\psi\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 , where    1 .",
    "@xmath21 is a spatial diffeomorphism ( usually taken to be in the semi - analytic category ) and @xmath22 is a representation of the diffeomorphism group on @xmath18 induced via its unitary representation on @xmath2.$ ] instead of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath12 $ ] is a continuum quantum hamiltonian constraint operator obtained as a limit point of a net of finite - triangulation operators defined on @xmath2 .",
    "we refer to ( [ eq : qdirac ] ) , and in particular to the second equation in ( [ eq : qdirac ] ) , as the off - shell closure condition for @xmath12 $ ] @xcite .",
    "once a quantization of the hamiltonian constraint is found which meets the above criteria , its kernel ( in @xmath18 ) is expected to give rise to the physical hibert space of the theory .",
    "this is a rather ambitious aim , and it is instructive to accomplish it in models which are , on one hand , diffeomorphism - invariant field theories with a gauge algebra being the dirac algebra , and on the other hand , are simpler and more tractable than gravity .",
    "models where this aim has been accomplished include ( * a * ) a two - dimensional parametrized field theory ( pft ) @xcite , and ( * b * ) the husain - kucha ( hk ) model @xcite .",
    "however , the main reasons that the constraint algebra in these models could be represented in an anomaly - free manner are the following :    1 .",
    "two dimensions are special in the sense that the dirac algebra in two - dimensional pft is a true lie algebra which is isomorphic to the witt algebra ( @xmath23 ) . in the hk model ,",
    "the only constraint ( apart from the gauss constraint ) is the spatial diffeomorphism constraint whose algebra is isomorphic to the lie algebra of ( spatial ) vector fields .",
    "2 .   the poisson action of constraint functionals on classical fields in these models has a clear geometric interpretation which provided key insights into the possible quantization choices .    neither of the above are true in the case of canonical gravity , and so as appealing",
    "as the results obtained in pft and the hk model are , we need to see if the lessons learned there can be applied to models which were more closely related to canonical gravity . in this paper",
    "we propose just such a model .",
    "it is a diffeomorphism - invariant ( in fact topological ) field theory in three dimensions which can be thought of as a weak coupling limit of three - dimensional euclidean gravity . as",
    "a weak coupling limit amounts to switching off self - interactions , in this case it amounts to switching the gauge group from @xmath24 to @xmath0 .",
    "the canonical formulation of the theory corresponds to the phase space of a @xmath0 yang - mills theory in @xmath25 dimensions with hamiltonian , diffeomorphism , and gau  constraints . on the ( gau ) gauge - invariant sector of the phase space , the remaining constraints ( hamiltonian and diffeomorphism )",
    "generate the dirac algebra .",
    "our aim in this paper is to loop quantize this system such that the ( continuum ) hamiltonian constraint satisfies the second equation in ( [ eq : qdirac ] ) .",
    "however , blindly looking for a possible quantization of the hamiltonian constraint which will lead to off - shell closure is a hopeless task , so we draw upon the lessons learned in @xcite to achieve our goal . in order to familiarize the reader with these lessons ,",
    "we briefly recall them below .      as explained rather beautifully in @xcite ,",
    "if one chooses to work with the density one hamiltonian constraint , then no matter what domain one chooses to take the limit of finite - triangulation hamiltonian constraint on , the resulting operator will always have a vanishing commutator with itself ( as long as limits of the finite - triangulation commutator are well - defined ) .",
    "in particular , the commutator of two density one constraints can never give rise to an operator which could resemble a quantization of the rhs .",
    "the reason for this is rather simple .",
    "consider a smeared hamiltonian constraint in @xmath26 spatial ( @xmath27 ) dimensions , @xmath28=\\int_{\\sigma}\\mathrm{d}^{d}x~n^{(1-k)}(x)h^{(k)}(x),\\ ] ] where the superscripts indicate the density weights of the various fields .",
    "the smearing function @xmath29 is a scalar density of weight @xmath30 while the local hamiltonian density @xmath31 has density weight @xmath32 . in lqg , the quantization of @xmath33 $ ] proceeds by first approximating the integral by a riemann sum over simplices ( which constitute a triangulation @xmath3 of @xmath34 ) and then approximating each term in the sum by a function of appropriate holonomies and fluxes . typically in lqg",
    "the fineness  of the triangulation is measured by a parameter @xmath35 ( usually associated with coordinate volume of a simplex in @xmath3 ) , and a simple dimensional analysis shows that @xmath36 &   = \\sum_{\\triangle\\in t(\\delta)}\\delta^{d-(2 + 2d-2)+d(2-k)}n^{(1-k)}(v(\\triangle))o_{\\triangle}(v(\\triangle))\\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\sum_{\\triangle\\in t(\\delta)}\\delta^{d\\left (   1-k\\right )   } n^{(1-k)}(v(\\triangle))o_{\\triangle}(v(\\triangle))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a function of holonomies and fluxes , constructed out of loops and surfaces associated to @xmath38 .",
    "quantization choices involved in the definition of @xmath37 are such that it has no explicit dependence on @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to see that for any @xmath26 , if the lapse @xmath29 is a scalar with density weight zero ( @xmath39 ) , then @xmath40 $ ] has no explicit dependence on @xmath35 .",
    "along with a special property of thiemann s quantization that the hamiltonian constraint operator does not act on the vertices ( of a spin network ) that it creates , this ensures that commutator of two density one operators vanish . note that as there are no explicit factors of @xmath35 left in the definition of @xmath41 $ ] and so also in the commutator , a quantization of the rhs can never arise , as it involves derivatives of the lapse functions , which  themselves require at least one factor of @xmath42 .",
    "this observation led the authors of @xcite to conclude that one must quantize higher density constraints in order to have explicit factors of @xmath42 which in the continuum limit could give rise to terms like @xmath43 . _",
    "the lesson we draw from these arguments is that even though density one constraints can be quantized on @xmath2 , if we are interested in seeking an anomaly - free representation of the constraint algebra , then one needs to work with higher density constraints . _",
    "[ for an interesting counter point to this argument , see @xcite . ]",
    "it was also argued in @xcite that , if one chose to work with higher density constraints such that one has enough factors of @xmath42 to obtain a non - trivial quantization of @xmath17 $ ] on the habitat , then the lhs will continue to vanish unless the hamiltonian constraint acts non - trivially on the vertices that it creates .",
    "this ought to be rather worrysome .",
    "in @xcite these observations were taken seriously and applied to two - dimensional pft .",
    "it was shown that one could obtain an anomaly - free representation of the dirac algebra if one quantized density - two constraints .",
    "the key point was to work with an appropriate density weight such that at finite triangulation , the hamiltonian constraint , when written in terms of holonomies and fluxes should have precisely one explicit factor of @xmath42 .",
    "in this case , the commutator will have a factor of @xmath44 , and this has the correct dimensionality to yield a quantization of @xmath17 $ ] in continuum limit .",
    "can , in the continuum limit , give one derivative , and hence can yield terms like @xmath45 and the other factor is precisely the factor one needs to obtain a quantum diffeomorphism constraint , which we expect to be linked with lie derivatives . ]    in the model considered in this paper , where the classical hamiltonian constraint is @xmath28=\\int_{\\sigma}\\mathrm{d}^{2}x\\ nq^{-k/2}\\epsilon^{ijk}f_{ab}^{i}e_{j}^{a}e_{k}^{b}(x),\\ ] ] it is rather easy to see that , in order to quantize the constraint such that at finite triangulation it has an explicit factor of @xmath42 , we need @xmath46 whence @xmath29 needs to be a scalar density of weight @xmath47 .",
    "as we mentioned above , one of the aspects which distinguish two - dimensional pft and the hk model from canonical gravity ( or for that matter the model of this paper ) is that poisson action of the constraints on the phase space data has a transparent geometric interpretation . in the first case , the hamiltonian constraint , being a generator of the witt algebra ,",
    "is intricately linked to spatial diffeomorphisms on @xmath48 . in the hk model , as the only constraint is the diffeomorphism constraint , its poisson action on @xmath49 is nothing but the lie derivative by the shift field .",
    "these interpretations were key inputs in pinning down the quantization choices for these constraints .",
    "the connection between the geometric interpretation and quantization can be encoded in the following schematic equation . given a spin network state @xmath50 ,",
    "let the corresponding classical cylindrical function be denoted @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath52\\psi\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\left [   \\text{finite action generated by } o[v]\\text { , parametrized by $ \\delta$}-1\\right ]   \\psi(a)\\ ] ] for example , in the case of the hk model , the quantization choices made in @xcite to construct the diffeomorphism constraint operator were such that this operator at finite triangulation equalled @xmath53=\\frac { 1}{\\delta}(\\hat{u}(\\phi_{\\delta}^{\\vec{n}})-1)$ ] .    if we were to follow this route to find out what quantization choices are to be made to construct @xmath54 $ ] , we are forced to look for a geometric interpretation of poisson action of the hamiltonian constraint . as we show in section [ classint ] ,",
    "there indeed does exist such an interpretation @xmath55}a_{a}^{i}\\approx\\epsilon^{ijk}\\mathcal{l}_{q^{-1/4}n\\vec{e}_{j}}a_{a}^{k}\\cong\\epsilon^{ijk}\\frac{(\\phi_{\\delta}^{q^{-1/4}n\\vec{e}_{j}})^{\\ast}-1}{\\delta}a_{a}^{k } \\label{eq : twistdiff}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 refers to equality modulo gau  law .",
    "thus the change in , say , @xmath57 under the action of the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath33 $ ] equals lie derivative of @xmath58 with respect to the vector field @xmath59 minus the lie derivative of @xmath60 with respect to the vector field @xmath61 .",
    "the second approximation is a discrete approximant to the hamiltonian vector field .",
    "we will seek a quantization of @xmath33 $ ] at finite triangulation which mimics this action on spin - network states .      as the finite - triangulation hamiltonian constraint has an explicit factor of @xmath42",
    ", it can not admit a continuum limit on @xmath2 ( in any operator topology ) , and whence the obvious question is , is there any admissible topology on the space of operators , and are there any subspaces of the space of distributions on which the continuum limit can be taken ?",
    "once again the case of two - dimensional pft and the hk model provide important clues .",
    "one needs to build spaces ( or habitats as termed in @xcite ) by studying the specific deformations of a spin network that the finite triangulation constraints generate .",
    "the topology on the space of operators can then come by looking at seminorms defined by ( generalized ) matrix elements of operators between these habitat states and states in @xmath2 .",
    "a priori , there can be infinitely - many habitats which can function as a home for the quantum constraints . in this paper , we consider the simplest possible habitat on which the continuum limit of the hamiltonian constraint exists and on which the off - shell closure relation be checked .",
    "we do not know if this habitat is physically interesting in the sense that it is * * a representation space for dirac observables .",
    "however , as our modest aim in this paper is to see if there is an anomaly free representation of the hamiltonian constraint on _ some _ space , we leave a detailed analysis of the construction of physically interesting  habitats for future research .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we outline how we implement the above lessons in our model and arrive at a quantum hamiltonian constraint which satisfies the off - shell closure condition .        as we want to quantize the hamiltonian constraint at finite triangulation such that it mimics the action in ( [ eq : twistdiff ] ) on charge network states , theory as charge networks @xcite , as the edge labels in this case are @xmath62 charges .",
    "] we need to define the quantum counterparts of the classical vector fields @xmath63 .",
    "this is where the loop representation throws its first surprise .",
    "although classically the triad fields are smooth , quantum mechanically they turn out to be operator - valued distributions .",
    "more precisely , given any charge network state @xmath64 , the graph of this charge network is the locus of discontinuity  of the @xmath65 operator . nonetheless ,",
    "as we show below , one can quantize @xmath66 in such a way that each charge network is an eigenstate , with its spectrum belonging to @xmath67 .",
    "given any charge network state @xmath64 based on the graph @xmath68 the expectation value of @xmath69 is non - vanishing only if @xmath70 and the resulting vectors  at the vertices of @xmath71 will be referred to as the _ quantum shift _ associated to that state .",
    "given a charge network state @xmath64 , the action of the regularized hamiltonian constraint operator produces two generic effects :    1 .",
    "the change in the edge labels is state dependent ; and 2 .",
    "a new degenerate vertex ( by degenerate we mean that the inverse volume operator acting at that vertex vanishes ) is created whose location depends on the quantum shift @xmath72 .",
    "we call such vertices _ extraordinary vertices_. the restriction of a charge network in the neighborhood of an extraordinary vertex has certain invariant properties that we enumerate below , and these help us isolate all the charge network states which lie in the image of the regularized hamiltonian constraint operator",
    ".      as the extraordinary vertices which are created by the hamiltonian constraint are degenerate , naively one would expect the ( regularized ) hamiltonian constraint to act trivially at such vertices .",
    "however , this result relies upon specific quantization choices and would lead to an anomaly in the constraint algebra .",
    "we cure this problem by once again going back to the analogous classical computation .",
    "the classical discrete approximant to the hamiltonian vector field of @xmath33 $ ] on a cylindrical function @xmath73 creates a linear combination of cylindrical functions with exact analogs of the extraordinary vertices mentioned above .",
    "these vertices are located along the integral curves of a triad - dependent vector field , so the action of a second hamiltonian constraint on a cylindrical function containing such vertices moves them ( as such an action will have a non - trivial effect on integral curves of phase space - dependent vector fields ) .",
    "this observation helps us in _ modifying _ the action of the hamiltonian constraint on extraordinary vertices , by making use of the quantization ambiguities that are available to us due to the structure of the loop representation .      finally by studying the precise nature of extraordinary vertices ( that is , the deformations in a charge network that the hamiltonian constraint operator creates )",
    ", we propose a definition of a habitat .",
    "it is a subspace of distributions , where each distribution is a linear combination of an infinite number of a specific class of charge networks with coefficients being dependent on the vertex set of the charge network .",
    "the underlying idea of this habitat is precisely the same as that proposed in @xcite ( though the habitat itself is completely different ) whence we call it a lewandowski - marolf - inspired ( lmi ) habitat . as we show in appendix [ a3 ] , on this habitat",
    ", the regularized hamiltonian constraint admits a continuum limit .",
    "we finally demonstrate that there exists a quantization of the rhs , @xmath74 $ ] on the lmi habitat such that the continuum limit of regularized commutators between the two hamiltonian constraints equals @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "we finally end with conclusions and highlight the open issues and some of the unsatisfactory aspects of our construction .",
    "some of these issues will be analyzed in the sequel @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the constrained hamiltonian system that we aim to quantize in this paper .",
    "the algebra of constraints that we eventually arrive at can be obtained simply by replacing the internal gauge group su(2 ) of general relativity in connection variables with a direct product of three commuting copies of u(1 ) , but there is another way , due to smolin @xcite , in which one takes newton s gravitational constant @xmath76 at the level of the action , and analyzes the resulting canonical theory .",

    "we focused on a part of the constraint algebra and finally derived a quantization of continuum hamiltonian constraint , which has the potential to give rise to a faithful representation of the dirac algebra . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our work along with @xcite is a first attempt towards a quantum realization of off - shell closure of the dirac algebra within the lqg framework .",
    "as the theory is topological abelian gauge theory , one might perceive this model as being too simplistic .",
    "however this is not quite true .",
    "as our main focus has been on understanding the off - shell closure condition in the quantum theory ( and as the theory is topological only on shell ) , we work in a genuine field - theoretic context .",
    "it is quite straightforward to generalize our results to @xmath718 dimensional @xmath0 theory ( which is precisely the model studied in @xcite ) and , in fact , some of the technical annoyance that we face in two dimensions ( e.g. , the presence of irrelevant vertices ) can be evaded in three spatial dimensions . on the other hand , in @xmath25 dimensions the physical spectrum of this topological gauge theory",
    "is well understood ( as states supported on the moduli space of flat @xmath0 connections ) , and a complete set of dirac observables is known .",
    "hence one could investigate the consistency of the quantum theory defined here by investigating issues associated to the kernel of constraints , and the representation of quantum dirac observables .",
    "we now recap the most salient aspects of our constructions before highlighting the key open issues and some of the unsatisfactory aspects of our work .",
    "the usual construction of composite operators in lqg is via some classical polynomial function of holonomies and fluxes .",
    "however , as we were motivated to look for a quantization of hamiltonian constraint which mimicked a certain discrete approximant of the classical geometric action involving phase space - dependent diffeomorphisms , our quantization choices involved quantizing @xmath697 as a holonomy operator ( with the holonomy being in a state - dependent representation ) and quantizing the remaining triad @xmath719 ( or more precisely @xmath720 ) as a quantum shift which generated the loop underlying the holonomy associated to @xmath697 .",
    "thus these choices have a spiritual  similarity to the ` @xmath1-scheme ' which led to a physically viable quantization of the hamiltonian constraint in lqc @xcite .- scheme , the triad dependence underlying the holonomy operator does not come from the @xmath721 term .",
    "we thank martin bojowald for pointing this out to us . ]    the hamiltonian constraint at finite triangulation @xmath470 $ ] created very specific types of vertices that we called extraordinary ( eo ) vertices .",
    "as the underlying gauge group is @xmath0 , these vertices are _ always _ degenerate ( i.e. , they are in the kernel of the inverse volume operator ) .",
    "this aspect of the construction bares some similarity to thiemann s hamiltonian , in which the newly created vertices are also degenerate .. the superficial extension of our analysis to @xmath24 suggests that the eo vertices created in that case will not be degenerate . ]",
    "whence at first sight it seemed as if one faces the same problem as thiemann s hamiltonian does , in that the action of a second successive hamiltonian will have no non - trivial action at eo vertices and the objections raised in @xcite will remain true in our case .",
    "however , this expected triviality overlooked a key fact about the eo vertices : their location  with respect to the original charge network was state - dependent , which was in turn due to the fact that these eo vertices were created along straight - line arcs of the quantum shift .",
    "this fact along with a classical poisson bracket computation suggested a plausible modification of hamiltonian constraint when it acted on eo vertices .",
    "the modification was such that its precise interpretation was a non - local  action ( i.e. , these actions were generated by operators which involved holonomies around finite loops ) not only on the eo vertex but on a subgraph containing the eo pair .",
    "however , the detailed understanding of such terms in the context of the underlying continuum classical theory is not clear to us and should be investigated further.@xcite    the action of the finite - triangulation hamiltonian constraint @xmath41 $ ] on a charge network @xmath64 is remarkably different than the action considered so far in lqg , and it is worth summarizing its three main features :    1 .",
    "the deformations of the graph underlying @xmath132 are state - dependent ( as dictated by the quantum shift ) .",
    "2 .   the @xmath0 edge labels in @xmath132 change , with the change itself being state - dependent .",
    "a certain special class of degenerate vertices move under the action of @xmath470 $ ] .",
    "all three of these conditions hint at a rather rich structure of quantum dynamics in the model that could be of interest to discrete approaches inspired by canonical loop quantum gravity .",
    "we then constructed a habitat which was designed in such a way that the continuum limit of the finite - triangulation hamiltonian constraint could be taken in the topology induced by a family of seminorms .",
    "the continuum limit hamiltonian constraint @xmath12^{\\prime}$ ] does not preserve this habitat and can only be interpreted as a linear operator from @xmath529 to @xmath516 .",
    "although this implies that the commutator of @xmath12^{\\prime}$ ] with itself is ill - defined , it turns out that the limit of finite - triangulation commutators is still well - defined on @xmath529 and is non - vanishing .",
    "we finally showed that there exists a quantization of the rhs , _ which is not quantized as an ordinary diffeomorphism with triad - dependent shift , but requires a specific operator ordering .",
    "_ this quantization matches with the continuum quantum commutator which is the lhs of the off - shell closure relation .",
    "we now come to the open issues and certain related unsatisfactory aspects of our work .",
    "our entire construction is based upon decomposing the hamiltonian constraint into three pieces involving @xmath722 , @xmath668 , and @xmath669 respectively .",
    "although each of these pieces is gauge - invariant in the present model , this is not true in the case of @xmath24 .",
    "thus more careful analysis is needed to extend our proposal to a quantization of the hamiltonian constraint in the @xmath24 case .",
    "the second issue lies in the choice of the habitat .",
    "our experience of how to construct habitats on which higher density operators in lqg admit a continuum limit is rather limited . after the seminal work done in @xcite , where a habitat was constructed in which thiemann s ( regularized ) hamiltonian constraint admitted a continuum limit ( once again in a seminorm topology induced by the habitat states and states in @xmath2 )",
    ", the only places where habitats have been utilized have been in @xcite . in these two examples habitats even turned out to be a physically - appropriate home for the quantum constraints , as the kernel ( which was known via other methods ) was a subspace of the habitat",
    ". however , in our case , the nature of the regularized constraints makes it rather difficult to construct a suitable habitat on which not only do the regularized constraints admit a continuum limit but also that all the details of the regularized constraint operators remain intact when we take continuum limit ( for example , the change in edge - labels induced by the action of @xmath41 $ ] go amiss when we consider the dual action on the habitat ) .",
    "it is important to note that we have constructed a habitat only with two goals in mind :    1 .",
    "@xmath723 $ ] admits a continuum limit ; and 2 .",
    "@xmath724,\\hat{h}_{t^{\\prime}}[m]]$ ] admits a continuum limit .",
    "@xmath529 need not be a physically relevant habitat as    1 .",
    "@xmath33^{\\prime}$ ] does not preserve @xmath529 .",
    "we do not know if the states in the moduli space of flat @xmath0 connections are included in @xmath529 3 .",
    "the classical theory is a completely integrable system , but we do not know if the habitat admits a representation of quantum observables and is there a precise sense in which these observables commute with the quantum constraints .",
    "detailed investigations of all these three issues could be key in constructing physically interesting habitats .",
    "there is an alternate viewpoint one could adhere to .",
    "let us assume that we can extend our constructions to three spatial dimensions , and appropriately density - weighted constraints that satisfy the off - shell closure condition on some habitat .",
    "as far as the @xmath0 theory is concerned , since the inverse volume operator is just a multiple of the identity operator on charge network states , the higher density - weighted operator induces an unambiguous definition of a density one operator .",
    "it is quite plausible that in the uniform - rovelli - smolin topology ( or some suitable generalization thereof ) , this density one operator converges to a densely defined operator on @xmath2 .",
    "then the requirement of off - shell closure would only be used to select , out of an infinitude of possible choices , a density one quantum hamiltonian constraint , and one could just choose to work on @xmath2 .",
    "a faithful representation of the dirac algebra entails not only the second equation in eq.([eq : qdirac ] ) , but all three of them .",
    "in particular , the construction of a finite - triangulation hamiltonian constraint operator involved certain background structure , which survived in the continuum limit . the definition of the quantum shift involved a certain regularization scheme and it is far from clear if this scheme is diffeomorphism - covariant .",
    "the notion of extraordinary vertices , which are required to lie inside certain balls around non - degenerate vertices is certainly a non - covariant notion , as one can map an eo vertex with respect to some charge network @xmath132 into a weo vertex with respect to the same charge network via some diffeomorphism .",
    "hence in light of the non - covariant structures which have gone into the construction of the ( continuum ) hamilonian , it is far from clear if the third equation in ( [ eq : qdirac ] ) is satisfied .",
