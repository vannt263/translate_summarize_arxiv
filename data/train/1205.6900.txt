    "systems of coupled josephson junctions ( jjs ) are prospective objects for superconducting electronics and therefore continue to be the subject of intense investigations.@xcite intrinsic josephson effects  tunneling of cooper pairs between superconducting layers inside of strongly anisotropic layered high temperature superconductors ( htscs )  provide an opportunity to model htscs as systems of coupled intrinsic josephson junctions ( ijjs ) and an effective way to investigate nonlinear effects and non - equilibrium phenomena in htscs .",
    "intrinsic tunneling is a powerful method for the study of the nature of high temperature superconductivity , transport along a stack of superconducting layers , and the physics of vortices .",
    "it also plays an important role in determining the current - voltage characteristics ( cvcs ) of tunneling structures based on htscs and the properties of vortex structures in these materials .",
    "parametric resonance in coupled jjs demonstrate a series of novel effects predicted by numerical simulations.@xcite in comparison with the single junction , the system of coupled jjs has a multiple branch structure in its cvcs .",
    "the outermost branch of the cvcs has a breakpoint ( bp ) and a breakpoint region ( bpr ) before a transition to another branch , caused by parametric resonance.@xcite the bp current characterizes the resonance point at which a longitudinal plasma wave ( lpw ) is created .",
    "it was demonstrated that the cvc of the stack exhibits a fine structure in the bpr.@xcite the breakpoint features were predicted theoretically@xcite and recently observed experimentally.@xcite a breakpoint region also appears in numerical simulations performed by other authors.@xcite    the physics of ijjs , which are nonlinear systems , can not be completely understood without the investigation of their chaotic features .",
    "parametric instabilities are common phenomena in one - dimensional arrays of josephson junctions . for example , a one - dimensional parallel array of @xmath0 identical josephson junctions was studied by discrete sine - gordon equation ( also known as frenkel - kontorova model ) in ref .. the parametric instabilities were predicted by theoretical analysis and observed experimentally . in particular , the novel resonant steps related to the parametric instability were found in the current voltage characteristics of discrete josephson ring .",
    "it was verified experimentally that such steps occur even if there were no vortices in the ring .",
    "a long josephson junction is also often considered as a one - dimensional parallel array of @xmath0 identical josephson junctions .",
    "an experimental testing of the parametric instability in ijj would clarify the generic feature of one - dimensional parallel and series array models and the role played by resonance related chaos in these systems .",
    "the chaotic features of ijjs in htscs are also of great interest due to the observed powerful coherent thz radiation from such systems.@xcite broadly tunable sub - terahertz emission was found in the cvc near the switching point from the outermost branch to inner branches , and also from inner branches.@xcite we stress that this is the same region in the cvcs where the bp and bpr were observed .",
    "recently , for example , coherent thz radiation has been measured experimentally and was associated with a `` bump '' structure corresponding to the same part of the cvcs.@xcite obviously , the chaos in ijjs could strongly effect their radiation properties , because the transition to the chaotic state may inhibit the coherent radiation from ijjs .",
    "therefore , detailed investigations of such transitions in real systems are very important .",
    "this situation makes the phase dynamics and the investigation of chaos in intrinsic jjs , near the bpr of the cvcs , an urgent problem .    in an early study of the rf current driven josephson junction",
    "it was found that , depending on the amplitude of the rf current , the system would develop a chaotic character.@xcite it was also shown that the onset of chaos as a function of frequency correlated with the function that indicated infinite gain , also as a function of frequency , for the unbiased parametric amplifier.@xcite more recently the importance of chaos in ijjs , and its effects on the cvcs and the shapiro steps in these systems , was stressed in refs . .",
    "in a further comprehensive study , the critical behavior of the dynamical equation , in the sense of how it goes from regular to chaotic , was investigated.@xcite it was discovered that the critical behavior is that of the circle map . here , in the subcritical state",
    ", the resonances are separated by quasi - periodic orbits ( i.e. having irrational winding number ) , whereas in the supercritical state the dynamics is composed of chaotic jumps between resonances .",
    "the chaos appears to be the result of the overlap of resonances.@xcite    in a similar study , the interaction of the josephson junction with its surroundings was considered by coupling it in parallel with an rlc circuit , modeling a resonant cavity.@xcite the chaotic nature develops through the familiar period doubling sequence of bifurcations .",
    "other studies exist that try to understand the irregular response of dissipative systems driven by external sources when such behavior is interleaved by the synchronized motion ( shapiro steps ) .",
    "this so called intermittent chaos is modeled by a random walk between the two neighboring steps that have become unstable .",
    "it is shown that the power spectrum of the voltage correlations has a broadband background characterizing the chaotic solution.@xcite it may be noted that a similar random walk model has been developed to explain the phase synchronization of chaotic rotators.@xcite    interesting features of chaos , chaos control and chaotic synchronization in josephson junction arrays ( jjas ) and shunted jj models have been described in refs .  .",
    "jjas attract much attention due to their perspective as high precision voltage standards and , as mentioned earlier , high power coherent thz sources .",
    "output power of a single junction is extremely low ( typically 10 nw ) , but much higher output power can be obtained by using jjas .",
    "chaos and nonlinearity in jjas have been described in refs .  .",
    "in particular , basler _ et al._@xcite reported on the theory of phase locking and self - synchronization in a small jj cell by using the resistively shunted junction ( rsj ) model and hassel _",
    "et al._@xcite studied self - synchronization in distributed josephson junction arrays .",
    "features of spatiotemporal chaos in jjas composed of rsjs were numerically investigated by bhagavatula _",
    "et al._@xcite chernikov and schmidt@xcite demonstrated that when four or more jjs are globally coupled by a common resistance , the system exhibits adiabatic chaos .",
    "direct calculation results @xcite showed that phase locking and chaos coexist when there are three junctions in the jja . in ref .",
    "chaos , hyperchaos and controlling hyperchaos in a jja were investigated .",
    "the numerical results show that chaos and hyperchaos states can coexist in this array of two shunted jjs , independently of whether or not the original states of the junctions are chaotic .",
    "although there have been recent reports on the chaotic behavior in jjs , such as ref .  , there are relatively few detailed investigations of chaotic behavior in closely - related phenomenological models such as , the capacitively - coupled model ( ccjj),@xcite the resistive - capacitive shunted model ( rcsjj),@xcite or the capacitively coupled josephson junction model with diffusion current ( ccjj+dc)@xcite of the present work .",
    "specifically , the chaotic features at the parametric resonance have not been investigated before .    in this paper",
    ", we study the phase dynamics in coupled josephson junctions . a resonance - type chaos related to the parametric resonance in this system is demonstrated .",
    "the origin of chaos is related to the coupling between junctions based on the fact that the superconducting layers ( s - layers ) are in the nonstationary nonequilibrium state due to the injection of quasiparticle and cooper pairs.@xcite we present results on a chaotic mode which is due to the coupling between junctions and a parametric resonance in coupled jjs .",
    "this mode can not be observed in case of a single jj .",
    "creation of a lpw and its interplay with a discrete lattice of superconducting layers produces a rich dynamic behavior , including , for example , intermittency .",
    "we use different methods to investigate this dynamics , including correlation functions and lyapunov exponents .",
    "results for stacks with different numbers of jjs , in which lpws with different wave numbers are exited , give interesting information on certain features of the fine structure within the bpr of the cvcs .",
    "the influence of the boundary conditions on the chaotic part of the fine structure leads to the manifestation of a strong proximity effect in ijjs .",
    "transitions between chaotic and regular behavior in bpr are predicted .",
    "transitions from the chaotic state to both a regular lpw state and a traveling wave mode are demonstrated .",
    "finally some general features of the system are analyzed and the conditions and parameters leading to a bpr with no chaos are found .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii we introduce the coupled sine - gordon equation , used for numerical simulations , and discuss the boundary conditions and numerical procedures .",
    "we briefly describe the method for calculating the lyapunov exponent .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of the resonance - related chaos produced in the temporal dependence of the electric charge , and this is demonstrated through the calculation of the maximal lyapunov exponent , phase - charge and charge - charge lissajous diagrams and correlation functions .",
    "we also provide examples of the manifestation of related chaotic features in the correlation functions and polar diagrams .",
    "the effect of the number of junctions in the stack is considered in sec .",

    "high - tc superconductors have a layered crystal structure and strong anisotropy .",
    "a model of multilayered josephson junctions , which has an alternating stack of superconducting and insulating layers , is sufficient to describe the electronic properties of these systems@xcite . in the present model",
    "we assume that the physical quantities are spatially homogeneous on each layer .",
    "this assumption is applicable in cases of no applied magnetic field and for a small sample size in the @xmath1-direction , i.e. for the intensively developing research field known as the physics of josephson nanojunctions , where the length of the josephson junctions is smaller than the josephson penetration length .",
    "one - dimensional models with coupling between junctions do capture the main features of real ijjs , like hysteresis and branching of the current voltage characteristics , and thus help to improve the understanding of their physics .",
    "an interesting and very important fact is that the 1d models can also be used to describe the properties of a parallel array of josephson junctions , which is often considered as a model for long josephson junctions .",
    "the experiments and theoretical studies on the propagation of josephson fluxons and electromagnetic waves in parallel arrays of josephson junctions were presented in refs .. their experimental data demonstrate a series of resonances in the current voltage characteristics of the array and were analyzed using the discrete sine - gordon model and an extension of this model which includes a capacitive interaction between neighboring josephson junctions .    to simulate the cvcs of intrinsic josephson junctions in high temperature superconductors we investigate the phase dynamics within the framework of the ccjj+dc model .",

    "the case @xmath71 strictly indicates that the system is chaotic over the approximate current interval of @xmath72 , while @xmath70 indicates marginal stability for the system elsewhere . both the cvcs and",
    "charge oscillations show chaotic features which coincide with @xmath71 .",
    "second , we study the correlations in superconducting currents in the neighboring josephson junctions , and charge correlations in neighboring superconducting layers .",
    "this allows us to further demonstrate the observed chaotic features in cvc .",
    "the charge - charge correlation functions for neighboring layers are given by @xmath73 where @xmath5 is the layer number and @xmath48 is the initial time for the averaging procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents the results of calculations for the cases @xmath74 and @xmath75 , for the same stack of nine jjs .",
    "the negative sign of @xmath76 is due to the fact that a lpw with wave number @xmath77 is created .",

    "we see that both correlation functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 show a similar variation with current , in agreement with the lyapunov exponent .",
    "third , manifestations of the chaotic behavior can also be demonstrated by phase - charge diagrams .",
    "to do so , we record the time dependence of the phase difference across the chosen junction and electric charge in the chosen s - layer at a given bias current .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows such a phase - charge diagram : the variation of the absolute value of charge in the first superconducting layer @xmath83 with the phase difference @xmath84 across the first jj of the stack .",

    "we next study the behavior of the stacks as a function of the number of junctions . to clarify this effect , we first discuss the parametric resonance features in the stacks with even and odd numbers of jjs .    in the stacks with an _ even number of junctions _ and periodic bcs , at @xmath88 , a lpw with wave number @xmath89 ( @xmath78-mode )",
    "is created , so that its wavelength @xmath90 satisfies the commensurability condition @xmath91.@xcite here @xmath92 is the length of the stack , and @xmath93 is the period of the lattice . in this case",
    "a fine structure in the bpr is absent and the transition from the outermost branch to another one is observed after a sharp ( exponential ) increase of charge in s - layers .",
    "also , the value of the breakpoint current is the same for all stacks with an even number of junctions .",
    "the sharp increase of charge in the s - layers happens in a very narrow interval of the bias current .",
    "for example , in a simulation of the cvc in a stack with @xmath94 and a current step of @xmath95 , the interval is ( 0.5771 , 0.5767 ) in which the increase of charge is of about 7 orders of magnitude .    in the stacks with an _ odd number of junctions _",
    "the wave number of the lpw is @xmath96 which approaches @xmath97 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the value of the bp current is limited by its value at @xmath89 , and the width of the bpr decreases with increasing @xmath0.@xcite with an odd number of junctions in the stack , the sharp increase of the charge accompanies the bp but then , before transition to another branch , a wide bpr exists.@xcite the origin of it is explained by the fact that the wavelength of lpw does not satisfy the commensurability condition .",
    "the fine structure is related to the character of the charge oscillations in the superconducting layers @xcite .",
    "a part of bpr reflects the chaotic behavior of the system , which is the main subject of our paper .",
    "next we look at how @xmath0 affects the structure of bpr . as mentioned above",
    ", the study of the correlation of charge on neighboring s - layers is a powerful tool to investigate the dynamics of charge in coupled jjs , within the bpr.@xcite here we use it to demonstrate the effect of the number of junctions on the structure of the bpr .    for the periodic bcs",
    "the number assigned to a junction is merely a label .",
    "however , in order to compare the correlation functions between stacks _ with different numbers of junctions , in different simulations _ , it is useful to use a specific layer as reference . in the parametric resonance region",
    "the phase dynamics in the coupled system of jjs singles out such specific layers , namely , if a node of the charge standing wave coincides with the layer , then the charge on that layer is close to zero .",
    "therefore we number the correlation functions according to their distance from such specific layers , as shown in fig .",

    "simulation of the time dependence of the charge in s - layers in these regions confirms the same character of the charge oscillations for all these stacks .",
    "the detailed features seen in the fine structure of the correlation functions , for the stacks with different numbers of junctions , and hence also different lengths , are related to the specific behavior of lpws with different wave numbers . as will be discussed in sec .",

    "it would also be of interest to calculate the full spectrum of lyapunov exponents , which would allow one to distinguish between chaotic behavior ( one positive exponent ) and hyperchaotic behavior ( more than one positive exponent ) .    to gain more information about the transitions we investigate the dependence of all the charge - charge correlation functions and the le , on the bias current in the bpr .",
