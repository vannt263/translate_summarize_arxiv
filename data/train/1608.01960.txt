    "modified gravity @xcite is one of the two main roads one can follow in order to provide an explanation for the early and late - time universe acceleration ( the second one in the introduction of the dark energy concept @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , apart from the cosmological motivation , modified gravity has a theoretical motivation too , namely to improve the renormalizability properties of standard general relativity @xcite .    in constructing a gravitational modification ,",
    "one usually starts from the einstein - hilbert action and extends it accordingly .",
    "thus , he can obtain @xmath2 gravity @xcite , gauss - bonnet and @xmath3 gravity @xcite , gravity with higher - order curvature invariants @xcite , massive gravity @xcite etc .",
    "nevertheless , he could start from the equivalent , torsional formulation of gravity , namely from the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite , in which the gravitational lagrangian is the torsion scalar @xmath4 , and construct various modifications , such as @xmath0 gravity @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) , teleparallel gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , gravity with higher - order torsion invariants @xcite , etc .",
    "an important question in the above gravitational modifications is what are the forms of the involved unknown functions , and what are the allowed values of the various parameters .",
    "excluding forms and parameter regimes that lead to obvious contradictions and problems , the main tool we have in order to provide further constraints is to use observational data .",
    "for the case of torsional gravity one can use solar system data @xcite , or cosmological observations from supernovae type ia , cosmic microwave background and baryonic acoustic oscillations @xcite .    on the other hand , in some modified cosmological scenarios one can obtain a variation of the fundamental constants , such as the fine structure and the newton s constants .",
    "such a possibility has been investigated in the literature since dirac @xcite and milne and jordan @xcite times .",
    "later on , brans and dicke proposed the time variation of the newton s constant , driven by a dynamical scalar field coupled to curvature @xcite , while gamow triggered subsequent speculations on the possible variation of the fine structure constant @xcite .",
    "similarly , in recent modified gravities , which involve extra degrees of freedom comparing to general relativity , one may obtain such a variation of the fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "however , since experiments and observations give strict bounds on these variations @xcite , one can use them in order to constrain the theories at hand .    in the present work we are interested in investigating the constraints on @xmath0 gravity by observations related to the variation of fundamental constants . in particular , since @xmath0 gravity predicts a variation of the fine - structure and newton s constants , we will use the recent observational bounds of these variations in order to constrain the @xmath0 forms as well as the range of the involved parameters .",
    "the plan of the work is the following : in section [ ftcosmology ] we give a brief review of @xmath0 gravity and cosmology . in section [ alpha ]",
    "we investigate the constraints on specific @xmath0 gravity models arising from the observational bounds of the fine - structure constant variation , while in section [ g ] we study the corresponding constraints that arise from the observational bounds of the newton s constant variation .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we provide a short review of @xmath0 gravity and cosmology .",
    "we use the tetrad fields @xmath5 , which form an orthonormal base at each point of the tangent space of the underlying manifold @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the metric tensor defined on this manifold ( we use greek indices for the coordinate space and latin indices for the tangent one ) .",
    "furthermore , instead of the torsionless levi - civita connection which is used in the einstein - hilbert action , we use the curvatureless weitzenbck connection @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "hence , the gravitational field in such a formalism is described by the following torsion tensor : @xmath9 subsequently , the lagrangian of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity , namely the torsion scalar @xmath4 , is constructed by contractions of the torsion tensor as @xcite @xmath10    one may consider generalized theories in which the lagrangian @xmath4 is extended to an arbitrary function @xmath0 , similarly to the @xmath2 extension of curvature - based gravity . in particular , such gravitational action will read as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the newton s constant .",
    "additionally , along the gravitational action ( [ actionbasic ] ) we consider the matter sector , and hence the total action writes as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total matter lagrangian including the electromagnetic field .",
    "finally , variation in terms of the tetrad fields give rise to the field equations as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and with @xmath19 the total matter energy - momentum tensor . in the above equation we have inserted for convenience the `` super - potential '' tensor @xmath20 defined in terms of the co - torsion tensor @xmath21 .    applying @xmath0 gravity in a cosmological framework we consider a spatially flat flrw universe with line element @xmath22 $ ] , which arises from the diagonal tetrad @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the scale factor . in this case",
    ", the field equations ( [ field - equations ] ) become @xmath25,\\label{f2 .",

    "i.e. at redshift @xmath36 ( we use the redshift @xmath37 as the independent variable , and for implicitly we set @xmath38 ) , one may derive that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the corresponding density parameter at present .",
    "hence , and using additionally that @xmath41 , equation ( [ f1.1 ] ) for this model can be written as @xmath42^b    + \\omega_{m0}(1+z)^3 . \\label{e2model1}\\ ] ] lastly , we mention that the above model for @xmath43 reduces to @xmath1cdm cosmology , while for @xmath44 it gives rise to the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite .",
    "* the second scenario is the square - root - exponential ( hereafter @xmath45cdm ) of @xcite , with @xmath46 in which @xmath47 and @xmath27 the two free model parameters out of which only one is independent . inserting this @xmath0 form into ( [ f1.1 ] ) at present time",
    ", one obtains that @xmath48 finally , the first friedmann equation ( [ f1.1 ] ) for this model can be written as @xmath49 \\",

    "\\!1\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ , = \\omega_{m0}\\,(1+z)^3 . \\label{e2model2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] lastly , note that this model reduces to @xmath1cdm cosmology for @xmath50 . hence ,",
    "in the following , for this model it will be convenient to set @xmath51 , and hence @xmath1cdm cosmology is obtained for @xmath52 .",
    "in this section we will use observational data of the variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath53 , in order to constrain @xmath0 gravity . let as first quantify the @xmath53-variation in the framework of @xmath0 cosmology . in general , in a given theory the fine - structure constant is obtained using the coefficient of the electromagnetic lagrangian . in the case of modified gravities ,",
    "this coefficient generally depends on the new degrees of freedom of the theory @xcite . even if one starts from the jordan - frame formulation of a theory , with an uncoupled electromagnetic lagrangian , and",
    "although the electromagnetic lagrangian is conformally invariant , and thus it is not affected by conformal transformations between the jordan and einstein frames , it will acquire a dependence on the extra degree(s ) of freedom due to quantum effects @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath54 is the extra degree of freedom that arises from the conformal transformation @xmath55 from the jordan to the einstein frame , then quantum effects such as the presence of heavy fermions will induce a coupling of @xmath54 to photons , namely @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the electromagnetic tensor , @xmath58 the bare coupling constant , and @xmath59 with @xmath60 the planck mass and @xmath61 a constant ( we have assumed that @xmath62 ) . hence , the scalar coupling to the electromagnetic field will imply a dependence of the fine structure constant of the form @xcite @xmath63 where the subscripts denote the einstein and jordan frames respectively , or equivalently @xmath64 the above factor is in general time- ( i.e redshift- ) dependent .",
    "therefore , it proves convenient to normalize it in order to have @xmath65 at present ( @xmath66 ) , which in case where @xmath67 is obtained through a rescaling @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we result to @xmath70    although the above procedure is straightforward in cases where a conformal transformation from the jordan to the einstein frame exists , it becomes more complicated for theories where such a transformation is not known . in case of @xmath0 gravity",
    ", it is well known that a conformal transformation does not exist in general , since transforming the metric as @xmath71 , with @xmath72 a smooth non - vanishing function of spacetime coordinates , one obtains einstein gravity plus a scalar field lagrangian , plus the transformed matter lagrangian , plus a non vanishing term @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "this additional term forbids the complete transformation to the einstein frame , and hence in every application one has indeed to perform calculations in the more complicated jordan one .    in order to avoid performing calculations in the jordan frame",
    "we will make the reasonable assumption that @xmath74 , which has been shown to be the case according to observations @xcite , and holds for the two forms considered in this work , namely ( [ model1 ] ) and ( [ model2 ] ) , too .",
    "hence , @xmath75 , and then @xmath76 is negligible , which implies that the above extra term can be neglected . in the end of our investigation , we will verify the validity of the above assumption .",
    "thus , we can indeed obtain an approximate transformation to the einstein frame , and in particular the introduced degree of freedom reads as @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "hence , inserting this into ( [ bf ] ) we acquire @xmath78 and thus inserting into relation ( [ finestuct1c ] ) , we can easily extract the variation of the fine - structure constant as @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "lastly , since @xmath61 , the above relation becomes @xmath81 hence , for a general @xmath0 , the ratio @xmath82 indeed depends on @xmath83 , through the @xmath84 function ( we remind that according to ( [ th62 ] ) @xmath85 ) , while in the case of standard @xmath1cdm cosmology , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 becomes 0 .",

    "<S> hence , @xmath0 gravity is consistent with observations , nevertheless , as every modified gravity , it may exhibit only small deviations from @xmath1cdm cosmology , a feature that must be taken into account in any @xmath0 model - building . </S>"
