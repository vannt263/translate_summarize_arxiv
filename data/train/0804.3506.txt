    "three dimensional non - linear sigma models are perturbatively non - renormalizable according to the power counting .",
    "the reason for this is that non - linear sigma models have an infinite number of interaction terms in the action . in three dimensions ,",
    "a scalar field has mass dimension @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , coupling constants of interaction terms involving more than six scalar fields has negative mass dimensions .",
    "this implies non - renormalizability in perturbation theory .",
    "some supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models were , however , argued to be renormalizable in three dimensions by the renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric @xmath0 model is one of the candidates .",
    "the @xmath0 model is a non - linear sigma model on the complex projective manifold @xmath0 , which was first introduced by eichenherr @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric version of the model was formulated by introducing an auxiliary gauge field @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group method is one of the powerful methods which can reveal the non - perturbative property of the theory .",
    "the renormalizability in the renormalization group method is equivalent to the existence of a non - trivial ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point of the theory . in the renormalization group analysis in @xcite , however , the effective action is expanded in powers of derivetives on spacetime and approximated by truncating at the second order of derivaties .",
    "although this approximation is valid in the low energy scale region , it is not obvious in high energy scale whether the approximation is valid or not .",
    "the existence of the uv fixed point of the three dimensional supersymmetric @xmath0 model is also shown by the @xmath1-expansion method up to the next - to - leading order @xcite . in the @xmath1-expansion , we expand amplitudes in powers of @xmath1 instead of coupling constant , where @xmath2 is the number of fields involved in the theory . in general , each term of @xmath1 expansion corresponds to a sum of infinite number of feynman diagrams in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1-expansion is an another powerful non - perturbative method .",
    "indeed , it was argued that the three dimensional nonlinear sigma models and its supersymmetric versions are renormalizable , order by order in the @xmath1 expansion @xcite . in the reference @xcite ,",
    "the beta function of the coupling constant was explicitly evaluated by using feynman rules in the component field formalism .",
    "it was shown that there is no next - to - leading order contribution of @xmath1 .",
    "because of supersymmetry , contributions of bosons and fermions cancel each other in the next - to - leading order of @xmath1",
    ". there might be , however , contributions of higher orders of @xmath1 .    in this paper , we study the three dimensional @xmath5 supersymmetric @xmath0 model and show that in the @xmath1-expansion there is no higher order correction to the beta function in this model . we also show explicitly that all divergences can be eliminated by the renormalizations of the coupling constant and the wave function of the dynamical field @xmath6 , namely the renormalizability in the method of @xmath1-expansion . in order to keep the manifest supersymmetry , we use feynman rules for superfields , which we call `` super feynman rules '' .",
    "for example , a chiral superfield @xmath7 can be expanded in terms of component fields as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , if we know the two point functions of component fields , we can costruct the two point function of superfield @xmath7 from them . using this propagator of superfield",
    ", we can explicitly see the cancellation due to supersymmetry .    in section 2",
    ", we review a part of the argument given in @xcite . for the @xmath1-expansion ,",
    "it is useful to introduce an auxiliary field in the action .",
    "although the auxiliary field has no kinetic term in the classical action , it acquires quadratic terms in the effective action induced by the quatum fluctuations of the dynamical field .",
    "when the auxiliary field is introduced , the path integration over the dynamical field becomes a gaussian integral and can be performed easily . after performing the integration over the dynamical field",
    ", we obtain the action with respect to the auxiliary field , which is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1-expansion turns out to be the loop expansion of the auxiliary field .",
    "this is the reason for introducing the auxiliary field .",
    "we evaluate the effective action to the leading order of @xmath1 to study the vacuum structure of the model .",
    "the model turns out to have two phases , `` symmetric phase '' and `` broken phase '' . the global @xmath10 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the broken phase , while it is unbroken in the symmetric phase .",
    "the supersymmetry is unbroken in both the symmetric phase and the broken phase . in the leading order of @xmath1 ,",
    "the effective action has a linear divergence which can be eliminated by the renormalization of the coupling constant .    in section 3",
    ", we evaluate the propagator of the chiral superfield @xmath6 in the symmetric phase , which can be obtained by combining the propagators of component fields .",
    "we call this propagator of superfield `` superpropagator '' .",
    "after we modify the chiral superfield @xmath6 by some similarity transformation , the superpropagator can be written by using differential operators on superspace .",
    "these differential operators can be obtained by modifing ordinary supercovariant derivatives @xmath11 .",
    "we call these differential operators `` twisted covariant derivatives '' .    in section 4 ,",
    "we first evaluate one - loop diagrams of the dynamical field , which induce the inverse propagator of the auxiliary field in the effective action . using the superpropagator of the dynamical field",
    ", we can easily calculate the one - loop diagrams by a partial integration over grassmann coordinates . from the inverse propagator of the auxiliary field",
    ", we secondly evaluate the propagator of the auxiliary field @xmath12 , which can be written in terms of ordinary covariant derivatives @xmath13 .",
    "in section 5 , we study divergent diagrams and the renormalization .",
    "we first evaluate the superficial degree of divergence and find that divergent diagrams can be classified into two types .",
    "we show that all divergences can be eliminated in each order of @xmath1 by renormalizations of the coupling constant and the wave function of the dynamical field . in the last subsection ,",
    "we evaluate the beta function of the coupling constant . in the @xmath1-expansion",
    ", there is no contribution to the beta function except at the leading order .",
    "we find that this model has a non - trivial uv fixed point .    throughout this paper we work in three dimensions with metric @xmath14 .",
