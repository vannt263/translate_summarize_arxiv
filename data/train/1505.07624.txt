    "human blood is , by volume , composed of about @xmath6 plasma ( mostly water and proteins ) and @xmath7 suspended blood cells .",
    "the majority of the blood cells are red blood cells ( rbcs ) , also called erythrocytes .",
    "other , less common blood cells are white blood cells ( leukocytes , one for 1000 rbcs ) which form a significant part of the immune system @xcite and platelets ( thrombocytes , one for 15 rbcs ) @xcite . the volume fraction of the cellular phase is called haematocrit @xmath8 .",
    "platelets play an important role in the process of blood clotting and the repair of damaged vessel walls ( endothelium ) . by mechanical contact with damaged endothelium",
    ", platelets can be activated .",
    "the activation involves a reorganisation of the platelet cytoskeleton , making them more flexible @xcite .",
    "activated platelets are capable of forming networks via fibrinogen and von willebrand factor molecules giving rise to the build - up of blood clots @xcite .",
    "non - activated platelets can be considered as rigid discoid particles over the entire physiological shear stress range ( up to a few @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the main task of platelets is to recognise regions of damaged endothelium and to assist in its repair .",
    "indeed , it is observed that the platelet concentration is , under certain conditions , significantly increased close to the walls @xcite .",
    "this near - wall excess is of physiological importance as it increases the probability for the platelets to adhere to the damaged endothelium @xcite .",
    "platelet concentration near the wall can be several times higher than that at the centre of the flow @xcite .",
    "the lateral motion of platelets , leading to this concentration inhomogeneity , is called _",
    "margination_. usually , the near - wall concentration peak is located within or near the cell - free layer ( cfl ) which is depleted of rbcs @xcite .",
    "the cfl thickness @xmath10 plays an important role in blood flow , leading to the fhrus and fhrus - lindqvist effects @xcite .",
    "rbcs have a twofold effect on the platelet motion .",
    "first , it has been observed that the presence of rbcs increases the diffusivity of platelets in blood vessels by orders of magnitude compared to their brownian diffusivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , non - diffusive platelet margination towards the vessel wall increases strongly when rbcs are present @xcite .",
    "the wall shear stress and the haematocrit have been identified as important parameters for margination @xcite .",
    "it is known that margination is only significant when the wall shear rate is above @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "there also seems to be a minimum haematocrit of @xmath12 below which no margination is observed for physiological stresses @xcite .",
    "margination becomes more important with increasing haematocrit @xcite .",
    "also platelet size and shape play a role for the margination efficiency @xcite .    only in recent years ,",
    "resolved computer simulations became available to study the mechanisms of platelet margination directly , without assuming effective platelet transport models .",
    "simulations are able to provide microscopic details ( such as stresses , cell velocities and deformations ) that are difficult to measure in experiments . as already assumed in the 1970s by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it is nowadays generally accepted that the dynamics of rbcs and their hydrodynamic interactions with platelets under the influence of shear are responsible for margination , rather than a volume exclusion effect @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the lateral platelet motion in the rbc - rich region is diffusive and caused by shear - induced fluid velocity fluctuations . according to @xcite , platelet margination , at least in the dilute regime ,",
    "is caused by heterogeneous collisions of platelets and rbcs .",
    "if the rbcs are sufficiently soft , these collisions lead to directed events which are necessary to explain margination @xcite . it can be concluded that the dynamical state of rbcs ( tumbling versus tank - treading ) plays a major role in platelet margination , as already suggested by @xcite .",
    "recent review articles provide more details @xcite .    in general ,",
    "platelet margination is still not well understood .",

    "[ fig : margination_bins](h , i , k , l ) , where the tube is larger . in the latter cases ,",
    "it is expected that all platelets will eventually reach the cfl after a sufficiently long time .    as a remark",
    ", there is also a platelet concentration peak near the centreline in fig .",
    "[ fig : margination_bins](i , k ) .",
    "note that the absolute number of platelets in that region is small since the bin area decreases linearly with @xmath187 for @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , the platelet concentration peak near the cfl edge is caused by many more platelets and is therefore more significant than the peak near @xmath189 .",
    "this is nicely borne out in fig .",
    "[ subfig : configuration_f ] where only three platelets are located near the centreline , but the remaining 25 are close to the cfl .",
    "therefore , the central peak is probably a statistical fluctuation due to the relatively short averaging period and limited platelet number .    to investigate the radial platelet transport in more detail , fig .",
    "[ fig : radialvelocity ] shows the average radial platelet velocity @xmath190 and its standard deviation @xmath191 as function of radial position @xmath187 for @xmath192 and @xmath193 . due to the small number of platelets and the fast margination ,",
    "the radial velocity data for @xmath5 and @xmath186 is too noisy to provide useful information .",
    "the first striking observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : radialvelocity ] is that the radial platelet velocity is close to zero everywhere , except near the edge of the cfl ( grey area ) for @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that platelets are pushed towards the wall if they have reached the edge of the cfl .",
    "this effect , however , only exists when rbcs are sufficiently strongly deformed and in the tank - treading state . for the presented tube diameters , collisions between platelets and nearly rigid rbcs ( @xmath4 )",
    "do not lead to a significant lateral platelet transport near the cfl .",
    "note that the lateral platelet velocity is closely related to the drift term in effective platelet transport models @xcite .",
    "the peak of @xmath194 coincides with the peak of @xmath162 in fig .",
    "[ subfig : cfl1 ] .",
    "therefore , platelets are already pushed outwards before they have passed the cfl edge . for both tube diameters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radialvelocity ] , @xmath194 becomes significantly larger than zero when the distance to the wall is about @xmath195 ; this is in good agreement with the results report by @xcite .",
    "[ fig : radialvelocity](b , d ) reveals that the radial platelet velocity fluctuation strongly decreases within the cfl .",
    "this is an indicator for reduced platelet diffusion in that region .",
    "one can see that the gradient of @xmath191 at the edge of the cfl is larger for higher @xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that escaping the cfl becomes increasingly difficult with growing @xmath1 because it is less likely that a platelet is moving fast enough towards the tube axis before it is pushed back .",
    "[ fig : radialvelocity ] can therefore explain why more platelets are seen leaving the cfl again in fig .",
    "[ fig : margination ] when @xmath1 is small .    furthermore , the radial velocity fluctuations in fig .  [",
    "fig : radialvelocity ] in the rbc - rich region increase with @xmath1 .",
    "this may result in a larger platelet diffusivity that further increases the lateral mobility of platelets when @xmath1 is large .",
    "concluding this section , one can say that non - diffusive platelet margination in tubes with @xmath196 is only observed when @xmath3 .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous experimental results reporting that margination is only relevant when the wall shear rate is larger than @xmath11 @xcite . according to the definition of @xmath1 in eq .",
    ", @xmath197 corresponds to @xmath198 .",
    "this threshold value is close to the point where rbcs near the cfl edge are starting to tank - tread .",
    "the onset of tank - treading therefore seems to be necessary for margination .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath5 where platelets move to the tube wall very fast , even at @xmath160 .",
    "a possible explanation is that many rbcs in fig .",
    "[ subfig : configuration_a ] fill the entire cross - section of the tube so that platelets can easily slide between them towards the cfl .",
    "normalised by wall shear rate @xmath91 of two platelets ( grey and black ) near the wall for @xmath192 and @xmath199 .",

    "averaged over all platelets near the cell - free layer .",
    "error bars indicate ensemble variances .",
    "lines are guides for the eye .",
    "note that the @xmath1-axis is logarithmic and that symbols have been slightly shifted along the @xmath1-axis to avoid overlap of error bars . ]",
    "once platelets are caught in the vicinity of the cfl , they show two main dynamical states : i ) tumbling in the local shear flow and ii ) sliding parallel to the flow axis @xcite .",
    "the central observable is the angular velocity of a platelet in a plane defined by the tube axis and the radial platelet position : @xmath202 .",
    "[ fig : slidingtumbling ] shows the time evolution of @xmath202 for two different platelets in the same simulation near the cfl .",
    "a freely moving platelet with axis aspect ratio @xmath203 in a shear flow with shear rate @xmath204 would be in a pure tumbling state leading to jeffery orbits with average angular velocity @xmath200 @xcite : @xmath205 in the present case , @xmath206 , and therefore @xmath207 as indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : slidingtumbling ] .",
    "sliding is caused by confinement due to the presence of the wall on one side of the platelet and the rbcs on the other .",
    "only occasionally a platelet has `` enough space '' to tumble .    as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : slidingtumbling ] , tumbling events are defined by localised peaks in @xmath202 , while sliding is accompanied by low - amplitude fluctuations of @xmath202 with zero average .",
    "each tumbling event leads to a @xmath208- or @xmath209-rotation of the platelet , called a _",
    "flip_. in fact , the time integral of @xmath202 over one flip turns out to be close to @xmath209 .",
    "a full rotation would therefore require two flips .",
    "an important parameter is the average relative tumbling rate of a platelet in the cfl : @xmath210 to consider only platelets in proximity of the cfl , the function @xmath211 is defined as @xmath212 therefore , the integral in the denominator in eq .   is the total time a platelet spends near the cfl : @xmath213 .",
    "[ fig : angularvelocity ] shows the tumbling rate @xmath214 averaged over all platelets near the cfl .",
    "the most striking observation is that tumbling is much less frequent than for a freely moving platelet .",
    "the tumbling rate is rather reduced to @xmath215@xmath182 of the value expected for a free platelet , indicating that sliding is the most likely dynamical state in the cfl for the investigated parameters .",
    "@xcite reported that the sliding probability strongly increases with decreasing cfl thickness .",
    "below @xmath216 , which is the case here , sliding starts to occur until it eventually becomes the dominating dynamical mode .    from visual simulation data",
    "it follows that platelet flips are correlated with `` overtaking '' events of individual rbcs that move just at the edge of the cfl . on the one hand ,",
    "a platelet is dragged along by a passing rbc . on the other hand ,",
    "platelets find more space in the gaps between rbcs once an rbc has passed .",
    "this makes it easier for a platelet to flip , but not all rbc overtaking events lead to a platelet flip .",
    "interestingly , @xmath214 is rather independent of @xmath1 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : angularvelocity ] .",
    "the tube diameter has a stronger effect ; larger tubes lead to a higher tumbling rate .",
    "this is probably related to an increase of the cfl thickness with @xmath0 : the thicker the cfl , the smaller the confinement felt by the platelets .",
    "flipping should therefore be easier and more frequent with increasing @xmath0 but otherwise constant flow parameters ( @xmath70 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the errors in fig .",
    "[ fig : angularvelocity ] , defined by the variance of the ensemble average of all platelets , are relatively large .",
    "the reason is that the total number of flips observed is small , and platelets show a wide distribution of number of flips . on average ,",
    "a platelet flips less than ten times during one simulation .",
    "tube flow of red blood cells ( rbcs ) and platelets was simulated using a combination of the lattice - boltzmann , immersed boundary and finite element methods .",
    "the aim of this work was to study platelet margination and subsequent platelet dynamics in the cell - free layer ( cfl ) for different tube diameters @xmath0 and rbc capillary numbers @xmath1 .",
    "tubes with diameters @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 were simulated , and the investigated capillary numbers range from @xmath160 , where rbcs are relatively rigid , to @xmath161 , where rbcs are strongly deformed and elongated .",
    "the tube haematocrit is @xmath2 .",
    "one main result is that platelet margination is facilitated by a non - diffusive radial transport near the cfl edge when @xmath3 .",
    "this is in accordance with previous experimental observations . for smaller",
    "@xmath1 , however , margination is less effective , and platelets are not irreversibly trapped in the cfl .    the non - diffusive platelet transport presents itself as a non - zero average platelet velocity in outward direction near the cfl edge .",
    "platelets within the outermost @xmath195 in the tube are affected by this drift .",
    "this explains why platelet margination is very fast for tubes with @xmath217 and @xmath221 where essentially all platelets are in wall vicinity .",
    "once a platelet has reached the cfl edge through diffusive motion , it is transported into the cfl due to collisions with tank - treading rbcs . at least for @xmath3 , this process",
    "is expected to continue until no platelets are left in the rbc - rich region .",
    "the simulations also show that the radial platelet velocity fluctuations are strongly suppressed in the cfl .",
    "the difference between these fluctuations within the rbc - rich region and the cfl increases with @xmath1 , which explains why platelets are less likely to escape the cfl with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore it is demonstrated that the predominant dynamical state of platelets in the cfl is sliding rather than tumbling , which is in line with earlier findings . due to the relatively small cfl thickness at @xmath2 haematocrit",
    ", platelets are strongly confined , and tumbling events are rare .",
    "they occur @xmath222@xmath215 times less frequently as expected for an unconfined platelet .",
    "the tumbling rate is only a weak function of @xmath1 , but grows with @xmath0 and therefore the cfl thickness .",
    "the presented results are in accordance with previous experiments and simulations . as such",
    ", this work sheds more light on the platelet margination mechnism which is still not well understood .",
    "it is demonstrated how the explicit modelling of deformable rbcs is necessary to observe margination as an emergent effect .",
