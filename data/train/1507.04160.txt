    "translocation of dna in narrow pores plays a central role in many biological processes , such as viral infection by phages and interbacterial dna transduction @xcite as much as in the development of novel devices for high - throughput and low - cost biotechnological applications @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "several experimental studies have explored the translocation process of dna through protein channels across cellular membranes or microfabricated channels @xcite .",
    "solid state nanopores have attracted considerable attention as ideal devices for reading off the base pairs while tracking the dna motion through nanopores @xcite .",
    "experimentally , during the dna translocation through a nanopore one measures rapid variations of the ionic currents due both to the steric hindrance and the negative dna charge density distribution . in principle",
    ", these variations can be used to decypher the dna base pair sequence , if one is able to finely identify the factors which modulate the current . to this purpose",
    ", one must characterize the differences between the ionic signal when the dna is in the pore or away from it .",
    "one observes that the ionic current shows a larger / lower value when the dna is inside / outside the pore depending on the concentration of the electrolyte .",
    "since the reservoirs provide an amount of counterions sufficient to screen the dna charge the number of charge carriers increases and thus determines a larger conductance , in spite of the fact that the effective section available to the passage of ions is smaller .    from the theoretical point of view dna translocation and the accompanying electrokinetic transport of electrolytes",
    "involve the comprehension of the competition between electrostatic , excluded volume and fluid - atom hydrodynamic couplings , with the key role played by the local confinement .",
    "therefore , understanding the physical mechanisms that regulate ionic transport calls for an accurate determination of each contribution and , wherever possible , for realistic computational modeling .",
    "in addition , as the diameters of the pore and of dna can be as small as a few nanometers , ionic transport is genuinely microscopic . at such length scale a careful evaluation of the local interactions requires a sophisticated theoretical treatment @xcite .    when dna translocates in a solid state pore , it assumes an elongated conformation , due to both the electrostatic repulsion stemming from different parts of the dna backbone , and by the axisymmetric and narrow shape of the pore .",
    "one of the most interesting effects of the high confinement is that the ensuing ionic current can be modulated in different and opposing ways .",
    "in fact , several authors have reported that ionic current can be either enhanced or blocked by the presence of dna within the pore @xcite .",
    "current blockage refers to the fact that ionic current could be temporarily reduced when dna is present within the channel .",
    "such effect is typically associated with the occlusion due to dna that diminishes the ionic fluxes .",
    "vice versa , current enhancement is also possible in a low - concentration electrolyte .",
    "such effect can be ascribed to the excess of charge carriers accompanying dna as it occupies the pore region , that are loosely bound to the biomolecule and therefore available to conduction .",
    "both blockage and enhancement are observable in experiments and their occurrence depends on the molarity , the degree of confinement , the nanopore material ( such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , and possibly other physico - chemical parameters @xcite .    in the present paper , we analyze how current modulation depends by several parameters by employing a dual theoretical / computational approach . due to the high level of confinement , one usually ignores the presence of convective currents , that is , considers frictional forces strong enough to effectively damp out electro - osmotic effects . to test such an issue",
    "we shall compare results obtained by taking into account convective currents with those that exclude these contributions .",
    "our description is encoded by the well - known poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) theory @xcite , as largely employed in the study of ionic transport in biological ion channels , such that only electrostatic , diffusive and migration contributions are considered .",
    "in addition , in order to simplify the analysis an effective one - dimensional equation based on a suitable homogenization procedure is written down @xcite . by identifying the entropic forces arising from the degree of confinement and , by imposing the local electroneutrality condition ,",
    "the conductance of the pore - dna system can be estimated .",
    "the enhancement / blockage diagram of the system reveals how the ionic current is modulated as a function of molarity , pore geometry , effective charge on dna and pore surface .",
    "in addition , besides the role of the dna intruder in the pore , the equations allow determining the contribution of the reservoirs , with the related access resistance , to the overall transport .",
    "being a one - dimensional differential equation , the analysis is particularly manageable in terms of computational and modeling efforts .",
    "for instance , we will represent dna as either a smooth or a corrugated cylinder , being either at rest or in motion within the pore , and assess how the enhancement / blockage diagram varies correspondingly .",
    "with respect to our previous study @xcite , we have improved the solution by replacing the local electroneutrality approximation used to determine the electric field by the more refined solution of the poisson equation .",
    "the computational cost of the approach is modest and can serve as a useful method to perform an early survey of dna / pore systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows in section [ model ] we define the model and its governing one dimensional effective equations . in section [ results ]",
    "we perform numerical calculations and discuss the results concerning the conductance and a conductance diagram obtained by considering the variation of the conductance upon inserting into the pore a long thin cylindrical charged object mimicking the dna molecule . finally , in section [ conclusions ] we present a few concluding remarks .",
    "[ model ]        we start by describing the system and how it is modelled in effective one - dimensional terms . the geometry of the three dimensional pore is sketched in fig . [ fig : schema ] and consists of two conical funnels connecting a straight pore .",
    "the radius of the channel , which has cylindrical symmetry , can be written as a function of @xmath2 alone :    @xmath3    the two conical funnels of variable radius are joined by the channel with section of constant radius @xmath4 and length @xmath5 , whose inner walls carry a fixed surface charge of area density @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the slope of the funnel and moreover @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "each funnel connects the pore to a reservoir and @xmath10 are the coordinates of the inlet and outlet of the cylinder , respectively .",
    "the dna molecule is described as a very long thin cylinder of radius @xmath11 and with @xmath12 , whose axis coincides with the one of the pore @xcite .",
    "the space between the pore walls and the dna is filled by an electrolytic solution and the cathode and the anode are placed at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and a potential difference is applied between them , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : schema ] .",
    "the evolution of the ionic concentrations is described within the framework of the poisson - nernst - planck theory , which combines fick s diffusion law with the drift induced by the electric field and the convection of the ions due to the motion of the solvent determined by the dna movement @xcite .",
    "the pnp three - dimensional model can be solved numerically , however an effective one - dimensional description can shed some light and has gained increasing popularity in recent times @xcite . in situations of interest",
    "the geometry of the channels is such that it is possible to neglect the variations of the relevant fields along some directions and reduce the description to a one - dimensional problem . in nanochannels of constant section ,",
    "whose transverse width is much shorter than the longitudinal size , the reduction is straightforward , otherwise one must take into account the effect of the varying shape .    the lengths which determine the electrostatic properties of the system are the debye screening length , @xmath15 , the bjierrum length @xmath16 , the typical radius of the pore , of dna and the pore length .",
    "the debye length is a function of the bulk densities of each ionic species , @xmath17 , the dielectric permittivity , @xmath18 , and the temperature @xmath19 , the electronic valence @xmath20 according to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath23 the elctronic charge .",
    "the bjerrum length is @xmath24 and under standard ambient conditions and for aqueous solutions is typically of the order of @xmath25 nm , while @xmath15 in electrolytic solutions of concentrations in the range @xmath26 m , @xmath15 varies between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus in channels of nanometric diameter @xmath15 can exceed their transverse size and the ensuing behaviour of the solution is mainly determined by the presence of the surface charges due to the partial overlap of the double layers of different bounding surfaces .",
    "one finds that the resulting ionic atmosphere is mainly composed by counterions , a feature of capital importance because it yields the possibility of controlling through the surface charge the ionic currents through the pores .    in the present treatment",
    "we only consider the steady current regime which does not require the full time dependent solution of the pnp equations .",
    "the condition that the ionic current densities , @xmath29 , must have vanishing divergence , @xmath30 , together with the property of impenetrability of the walls , yield the following relation between the average axial component , @xmath31 , of the three - dimensional current and the variable section of the pore : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the transverse section of the system and @xmath34 the current .",
    "after this premise , in the stationary state @xmath35 is the sum of four different terms : the diffusive contribution , the entropic term , accounting for the modulation of the confinement @xcite , the migration contribution stemming from the driving electric field and a convective term due to the electro - osmotic flow induced by the charges present on the pore and dna surfaces . the r.h.s . of the following expression encodes the four different contributions , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the species coefficient of diffusion .",
    "the convective velocity @xmath38 , will be discussed below , depends on the surface charges of the pore and dna and on the electric field along the axis direction .",
    "equation represents an ordinary first order differential equation for the one - dimensional linear density @xmath39 of species @xmath40 , which is related to the three dimensional ionic densities @xmath41 by the following sectional averaging : @xmath42 where the sectional area @xmath33 for the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] is @xmath43    similarly , we define the sectionally averaged electric field : @xmath44 which as shown in ref .",

    "the terms proportional to the surface charge of the walls @xmath6 and of the dna intruder @xmath47 appear as source terms in the one - dimensional representation and stem from the boundary conditions and on the reduction of the original three dimensional problem .",
    "the geometrical term containing the logarithm of @xmath33 enforces the conservation of the flux of the electric field in a system of variable pore section .",
    "the set of effective one - dimensional equations here considered represents a convenient approach to the solution of full three - dimensional problems , which involve a demanding numerical effort .",
    "as far as the performance of the one - dimensional pnp model ( pnp1 ) versus the corresponding three dimensional model ( pnp3 ) we verified that the narrower the channel , the larger is the difference in profiles between the two types of solutions @xcite .    in the case of a binary electrolytic solution one has to solve",
    "three coupled differential equations : the two equations are needed to determine the local concentrations of the @xmath40 species , while the third equation determines the electric field produced by the ionic charge distribution and the fixed charges . in the literature one often employs the so - called local electroneutrality approximation ( len ) @xcite because it avoids the effort of finding the solution of eq . which is not known in closed analytical form .",
    "the len approximation states that locally there is no charge separation , a fact that may be justified because the typical values of the screening length @xmath15 are small as compared with the system dimensions , such as the longitudinal and transverse channel sizes .",
    "in other words one assumes that at each point @xmath2 the mobile charges exactly balance the fixed surface charges , as it occurs in the limit of vanishing @xmath15 .",
    "the electric field does not satisfy the one dimensional poisson equation , but takes values that enforce the absence of charge separation . under steady state conditions",
    "one can express the charge density distribution in terms of the fixed surface charge distribution and obtain a very simple equation for the density profiles in terms of the electric current and the mass current @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", dimensional analysis shows that the len may break down in nanometric systems , that is , when the system size is of the same order as @xmath15 .    to fix the convective velocity , @xmath38 , that plays the role of an input parameter in the pnp model",
    ", we follow ghosal s treatment @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) by imposing the boundary conditions @xmath62 we approximate the convective velocity featuring in eq . by the following sectional average",
    ": @xmath63 notice that in the cases here considered such a velocity turns out to be larger than the translocation velocity of the dna molecule whose value can be estimated as : @xmath64    in order to give an idea of the importance of the electric current associated with the eof , @xmath65 , with respect to the conduction current , @xmath66 , we consider the ratio : @xmath67 for sodium ions in water at 1 m concentration the above ratio is approximately @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath57 are the diffusion coefficient of the ions and the dynamic viscosity of water , respectively .    as mentioned in the introduction to detect the passage and eventually sequence dna , one monitors the ionic conductance @xmath70 of the pore . on theoretical grounds , the total resistance @xmath71 of the system shown in fig",
    "1 is the sum of the resistances of five different pieces : the resistance associated with the two funnels plus the resistance due to the two cylindrical regions adjacent the electrodes and the central part , @xmath72 . in the absence of surface charges the total conductance can be approximated by the following ohmic formula ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the resistivity defined in terms of the coefficient @xmath69 as @xmath75 .",
    "we first evaluate the effect of the presence of a cylindrical intruder of radius @xmath11 within the pore in the limit of @xmath76 and @xmath77 and no charges . by taking into account the reduced section available",
    "one estimates the difference in conductance between the free and the obstructed pore we find from eq . :",
    "@xmath78 although the conductance due to the obstruction always results negative on the basis of steric arguments , the presence of negative charges on the dna and not included in formula , may lead to a different answer .",
    "in fact , some positive ions migrate from the reservoirs towards the negative surfaces and increase locally the number of mobile carriers and one observes a conductivity larger than in the absence of dna .",
    "such a phenomenon is particularly relevant at low ionic concentrations and is related to the so - called surface conduction mechanism @xcite .    the competition between enhanced conduction due to the presence of surface charges and the depletion due to the reduction of the available pore section due to the dna leads to an interesting dependence of the relative conductance on the dna features .",
    "hereafter , we shall study the conductance variations , as the concentration of the solution and the surface charge are varied , by comparing the numerical results relative to the one - dimensional pnp model with the predictions based on the len theory , which provides simple expressions for small potential and concentration drops .",
    "the simulations were performed considering systems comprised of the five different regions illustrated in fig .
