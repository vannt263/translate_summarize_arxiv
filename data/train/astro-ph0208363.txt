    "the forcing of a gaseous disk by a gravitational perturber at a resonance can result in a strong response and an interchange of energy and angular momentum between the perturber and the disk .",
    "a corotation resonance arises where the pattern speed of the forcing matches the local angular speed of disk material .",
    "this occurs in the context of galaxies where a stellar bar or spiral arms force motions in the interstellar medium ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "corotation resonances also arise when satellites orbit within a disk , as occurs with young planets in protoplanetary disks , or moons in planetary ring systems ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 , 1980 ; hereafter gt79 and gt80 respectively ) .    for planets , two types of corotation",
    "resonance need to be distinguished .",
    "a coorbital corotation resonance occurs where the orbital period of the planet matches the orbital period of disk material . for a planet with a circular orbit",
    ", this is the only type of corotation resonance that can arise .",
    "the second type of corotation resonance is non - coorbital and occurs if the planet executes an eccentric orbit .",
    "the forcing due to a planet with an eccentric orbit can be decomposed into a series of rotating components of various strengths and pattern speeds ( gt80 ) .",
    "bar or spiral galaxies , on the other hand , give rise to non - coorbital resonances .",
    "the analyses of the coorbital and non - coorbital resonances are different . in the coorbital case , which has recently been considered by masset ( 2001 , 2002 ) and balmforth & korycansky ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the forcing is stronger and involves multiple fourier components",
    ". there is more likely to be a reduction in density caused by the tendency of the planet to open a gap in the disk . in this paper , however , we are concerned with non - coorbital corotation resonances , which are critical in determining the eccentricity evolution of planets resulting from planet",
    " disk interactions ( gt80 ) , and are therefore likely to be important in explaining the eccentricities of many of the observed extrasolar planets . for a disk in which a gap is opened by a planet",
    "having a small orbital eccentricity , corotation resonances tend to damp the planet s eccentricity , while lindblad resonances cause it to grow .",
    "the effects of each type of resonance are strong , but are nearly equal in magnitude , to the extent that they nearly cancel .",
    "the balance is slightly in favor of eccentricity damping , if the corotation resonances operate at maximal efficiency ( i.e. , are unsaturated ) .",
    "the final outcome of eccentricity evolution depends on the details .",
    "the disturbances of the disk caused by a corotation resonance remain localized to the corotation region ( gt79 ) .",
    "they are unable to propagate away from the resonance , as occurs in the case of lindblad resonances .",
    "instead , they act back locally on the disk and may change its density and vorticity in such a manner as to reduce ( saturate ) the corotation torque ( e.g. , ward 1991 )",
    ". however , the effective turbulent viscosity of the disk could lessen the saturation by limiting the back - reaction on the disk ( ward 1992 ) .",
    "full saturation occurs when the torque is reduced to zero , but even a small degree of saturation ( 5% ) could change the sense of eccentricity evolution in the gt80 model from decay to growth ( goldreich & sari 2002 ) .    in this paper , we develop a detailed model for the saturation of a non - coorbital corotation resonance in a viscous accretion disk .",
    "we determine how the strength of the corotation torque varies with the strength of the tidal forcing and the effective viscosity of the disk .",
    "the interaction between the perturber and the disk in the corotation region can be considered to involve two distinct aspects . in one aspect",
    ", the tidal potential excites an evanescent disturbance in the disk , i.e. , a disturbance that decays exponentially with distance from the resonance over the corotation region . associated with this disturbance",
    "are evanescent angular momentum fluxes that are oppositely directed on the two sides of the resonance . in the linear ,",
    "inviscid theory of gt79 , there is a jump in the flux at the resonance that corresponds to a torque being injected into the disk exactly at the corotation radius .",
    "the torque depends on the radial derivative of the ratio of the surface density to the vorticity at corotation . in the second aspect",
    ", the disk responds to the torque by changing the distributions of surface density and angular velocity over the corotation region ( lubow 1990 ) .",
    "these changes are such as to cause a reduction in the torque , and , ultimately , it is expected that the torque will be eliminated .",
    "this picture is time - dependent because the torque injection continues until full saturation occurs .    in the case of an accretion disk ,",
    "full saturation may not occur owing to the effects of turbulent viscosity in limiting the back - reaction .",
    "we therefore aim to find steady - state solutions in which the torque on the disk is nonzero .",
    "we also allow simultaneously for both aspects described above , by formulating a nonlinear problem in which the feedback is included self - consistently . in the process of the analysis",
    ", we will determine the size of the region over which the torque is injected into the disk .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional gaseous disk having a barotropic equation of state , so that the pressure @xmath0 depends only on the density @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that the forcing potential and the properties of the unperturbed disk vary smoothly in radius across the corotation region .",
    "these assumptions may need to be reconsidered if the resonance is very close to the planet ( i.e. , at a distance comparable to the vertical scale - height @xmath2 of the disk ) , or close to a sharp disk edge ( where the density varies on a radial scale comparable to @xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the torque cut - off ( gt79 ) limits the effectiveness of resonances that are closer than approximately @xmath2 , and a gap in the disk about the planet s orbit may eliminate such close resonances in any case .",
    "we also consider the planet to execute a fixed orbit , and ignore any effects of migration .",
    "the disk is governed by the equation of mass conservation , @xmath3 and the equation of motion , @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the velocity , @xmath6 the gravitational potential , @xmath7 the enthalpy , and @xmath8 the stress tensor , which represents a viscous or turbulent stress . for a navier  stokes model we have @xmath9 +    ( \\mu_{\\rm b}-{\\textstyle{{2}\\over{3}}}\\mu)(\\nabla\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath$u$}}){\\bf1},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the shear viscosity and @xmath11 the bulk viscosity .",

    "we consider the first - order eccentric corotation resonances associated with a planet of mass ratio @xmath244 executing a orbit of eccentricity @xmath245 within a keplerian disk .",
    "gt80 provide expressions for the locations of these resonances and the forcing potentials .",
    "inner and outer resonances occur at radii @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit .",
    "the amplitude of the forcing potential may be written in the form @xmath248 where @xmath249 is a correction factor that tends to unity for large @xmath41 .",
    "accordingly , the saturation parameter of our analysis is @xmath250 where we write @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "when @xmath253 , i.e. , when @xmath254 @xmath255 saturation occurs because @xmath256 . for @xmath257 saturation",
    ", only @xmath258 is required .",
    "table  1 contains results for the lowest - order outer eccentric resonances ( @xmath259 in the notation of gt80 ) for a disk with @xmath260 and a planet of mass ratio @xmath261 .",
    "the first column labels the azimuthal wavenumber of the potential component being considered . the second column gives the location of the resonance in units of @xmath247 .",
    "the third column contains the correction factor defined in equation ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "the fourth column gives a measure of the relative importance of the resonances : neglecting the torque cut - off and any differences in the disk parameters between different resonant radii , the unsaturated torque scales @xmath262 .",
    "the fifth column , labeled @xmath263 , is the eccentricity required to reduce the eccentric corotation torque @xmath255 below its unsaturated value for a turbulent viscosity parameter @xmath264 .",
    "the sixth column , @xmath265 , is similar to the fifth column , but gives the eccentricity needed to reduce the torque @xmath257 below its unsaturated level .",
    "the final column , @xmath266 , is the value of @xmath267 corresponding to @xmath255 saturation when the eccentricity is @xmath268 .",
    "table  2 gives the same data for the inner resonances ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "resonances of high order occur very close to the planet s orbit , and are present only if the planet does not clear a substantial gap in the disk .",
    "an analysis of such resonances requires a consideration of a number of effects that we have neglected . when @xmath41 becomes comparable to @xmath270 , additional terms in the dynamical equations",
    "must be included , and the torque is reduced from the standard value ( gt79 ) .",
    "the proximity of the resonance to the planet also means that the perturbing potential varies significantly with @xmath271 within the disk , and the relevant quantity is the density - weighted vertical average of the potential , rather than the mid - plane value ( ward 1986 , 1989 ) .",
    "these two effects apply equally to lindblad and corotation resonances , and so do not alter the @xmath257 balance between torques that excite and damp eccentricity .",
    "a further effect is that neighboring resonances of sufficiently high order overlap one another , which may alter the resonant torques .",
    "we have determined the torque exerted in a steady state by an external potential on a three - dimensional gaseous disk at a non - coorbital corotation resonance .",
    "our model accounts for the feedback of the torque on the surface density and vorticity in the corotation region , and assumes that the disk has a barotropic equation of state and a nonzero effective viscosity .",
    "the torque formula of goldreich & tremaine ( 1979 ) ( eq .",
    "[ [ tgt ] ] ) must be modified by a reduction factor @xmath145 , plotted in figure  1 , which quantifies the extent to which the resonance is saturated .",
    "this factor depends essentially on a single dimensionless parameter @xmath0 , defined in equation ( [ p ] ) , which measures the strength of the potential @xmath42 relative to the viscosity @xmath83 ( i.e. , the nonlinearity relative to the dissipation ) .    in section  [ numerical solution ]",
    ", we determined that the characteristic radial width of the resonance in the limit of large @xmath0 ( low viscosity ) is @xmath272 .",
    "( this refers to the scale of reynolds and viscous stresses ; the tidal torque is spread over a region of characteristic width @xmath273 . ) we found that the torque is reduced by a factor @xmath274 , which can be regarded as the ratio of the viscous diffusion rate @xmath275 over the libration region to the libration rate @xmath276 . in this regime , our results are broadly consistent with the saturation model of ward ( 1992 ) , which involves the same ratio of rates , but applied to the coorbital region .",
    "earlier , goldreich & tremaine ( 1981 ) had argued that , in a disk of collisional particles , saturation would occur when ( in our notation ) @xmath238 .",
    "goldreich & sari ( 2002 ) have recently developed an evolutionary model for planetary eccentricity in which eccentricity growth occurs through a finite - amplitude instability . for infinitesimal eccentricity",
    ", the damping caused by corotation resonances just overcomes the eccentricity growth due to lindblad resonances . above a critical level of eccentricity ,",
    "however , the corotation resonances become sufficiently saturated that growth occurs . using our evaluation of the saturation function @xmath145 ,",
    "goldreich & sari ( 2002 ) were able to determine the critical value of eccentricity required within the context of a specific disk model .",
    "the results in section  [ application to eccentric resonances ] and table  1 show that for a jupiter - mass planet orbiting within a typical protoplanetary disk , eccentricities of a few percent are adequate to saturate all first - order eccentric corotation resonances except those of the lowest @xmath41-values ( @xmath277 ) . to achieve a @xmath257 reduction in torque at such resonances ,",
    "as may be sufficient to change the balance from eccentricity damping to growth ( gt80 ) , requires only eccentricities of @xmath278 or less .",
    "exactly which resonances contribute most to eccentricity evolution depends on the extent of the gap cleared by the planet , which in turn depends on the mass ratio and the properties of the disk .",
    "as seen in table  1 , the largest corotation torques are those associated with the highest @xmath41-values , and they are the easiest to saturate . a lower - mass planet that opens a smaller gap may excite many resonances so that the dominant torque comes from approximately the cut - off @xmath41-value , of order @xmath270 ( gt80 ) . in that case , @xmath255 saturation is achieved optimistically at the torque cut - off when @xmath279 . note that , although the large value of @xmath41 is advantageous for saturation , the low mass of the planet is unfavorable ( see eq .",
    "[ [ e_063 ] ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the planet mass is small enough so that there is no gap in the disk , then the coorbital resonances cause eccentricity decay ( ward 1988 ; artymowicz 1993 ) .",
    "we have neglected a number of potential complications .",
    "numerical simulations of a jupiter - mass planet in a circular orbit with the disk parameters adopted in section  [ application to eccentric resonances ] suggest that the disk edge is not sharp ( i.e. , its radial extent is much greater than @xmath2 ; see figure  1 of lubow , seibert , & artymowicz 1999 ) .",
    "it is evident , however , that within the radial extent of the planet s roche lobe , material is captured by the planet and the resonant effects considered here do not play a role .",
    "it is not clear which eccentric corotation resonances are excited in the presence of an eccentric planet .",
    "the complications are due at least in part to nonlinear effects other than those considered here . for example",
    ", shocks associated with the planet s wake cause a non - closure of streamlines in the vicinity of the disk edge , leading to a drift of material through the corotation regions .",
    "in addition , material within the roche lobe of the planet exerts torques that may contribute to the eccentricity balance .    as usual in accretion disk theory , our knowledge of the effective viscosity of the disk is limited . in section",
    "[ a simplifying assumption ] we adopted a convenient assumption in order to make analytical progress .",
    "although we have succeeded in analyzing a three - dimensional disk , thereby generalizing existing theories , we assumed that the disk was barotropic .",
    "the effects of buoyancy or baroclinicity on the corotation region remain uninvestigated .    in recent work",
    "we were able to verify analytical theories of the torques exerted at lindblad and vertical resonances through direct numerical simulations ( bate et al .",
    ". it would be valuable to conduct simulations of a non - coorbital corotation resonance to test the findings of the present paper .",
    "after eccentric corotation resonances saturate at small eccentricity , the eccentricity growth may be limited at intermediate values .",
    "the limitation may be due to the overlap of resonances or alternatively through the excitation of higher order lindblad resonances , some of which cause eccentricity damping .",
    "a contribution to eccentricity damping occurs at an eccentric inner ( outer ) lindblad resonance that lies outside ( inside ) the planet s orbit .",
    "sph simulations of eccentric - orbit binary stars suggest that little eccentricity growth via resonances occurs for eccentricities in the range of @xmath280 or higher ( lubow & artymowicz 1993 ) , and similar limits may occur for planets .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found a simple quantitative measure of the saturation of a corotation resonance in a gaseous disk .",
    "this analysis suggests that planets may plausibly experience a net growth of eccentricity through their interaction with the disk in a variety of circumstances , provided that the eccentricity is not extremely small to begin with .",
