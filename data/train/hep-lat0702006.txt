    "there are several advantages in studying a heavy - light system on a lattice .",
    "our meson is much more simple than in true qcd : one of the quarks is static with the light quark `` orbiting '' it .",
    "this makes it very beneficial for modelling . on the lattice",
    "an abundance of data can be produced , and we know which state we are measuring  the physical states can be a mixture of two or more configurations , but on the lattice this complication is avoided . however , our results on the heavy - light system can still be compared to the @xmath2 meson experimental results .",
    "we have measured both angular and radial excitations of heavy - light mesons , and not just their energies but also some radial distributions . since the heavy quark spin decouples from the game we may label the states as @xmath3 , where l is the angular momentum and @xmath4 is the spin of the light quark .",
    "the measurements were done on a @xmath5 lattice .",
    "we have two degenerate quark flavours with a mass that is close to the strange quark mass .",
    "the lattice configurations were generated by the ukqcd collaboration . more details of the different lattices used in this study can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein .",
    "two different levels of fuzzing ( 2 and 8 iterations of conventional fuzzing ) were used in the spatial directions to permit the extraction of the excited states .",
    "the 2-point correlation function ( see figure  [ fig : corr ] ) is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the heavy ( infinite mass)-quark propagator and @xmath8 the light anti - quark propagator .",
    "@xmath9 is a linear combination of products of gauge links at time @xmath10 along paths @xmath11 and @xmath12 defines the spin structure of the operator .",
    "the @xmath13 means the average over the whole lattice .",
    "the energies ( @xmath14 ) and amplitudes ( @xmath15 ) are extracted by fitting the @xmath16 with a sum of exponentials , @xmath17 fuzzing indices have been omitted for clarity .",
    ".heavy - light meson energy differences in gev . lattice 1 uses a static heavy quark , whereas lattices 2 and 3 are slightly smeared in the time direction .",
    "lattice 2 uses ape type smearing and lattice 3 uses hypercubic blocking . see  @xcite for details .",
    "@xmath18  fm was used to convert the energies to physical units .",
    "( note : in the first version of this article @xmath19  fm was used . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the energy spectrum obtained is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : espectr ] and in table  [ energytable ] .",
    "there seems to be some spread in the extracted energy for the p@xmath20 state between the different lattices , but the reason for this is not understood yet .",
    "the energy of the d@xmath21 state was expected to be near the spin average of the d@xmath22 and d@xmath20 energies , but it turned out to be a poor estimate of this average .",
    "thus it is not clear whether or not the f@xmath21 energy is near the spin average of the two f - wave states , as was hoped .",
    "our earlier results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one interesting point to note here is that the spin - orbit splitting of the p - wave states is small , almost zero .",
    "we extracted the energy difference of the p@xmath20 and p@xmath22 states in two different ways :    1 .",
    "_ indirectly _ by simply calculating the difference using the energies given by the fits in eq",
    ".  [ c2fit ] , when the p@xmath20 and p@xmath22 data are fitted separately .",
    "2 .   combining the p@xmath20 and p@xmath22 data and fitting the ratio @xmath23 , which enables us to go _ directly _ for the spin - orbit splitting , @xmath24 .",
    "the results of the fits are @xmath25  mev and @xmath26  mev , respectively .",
    "d - wave spin - orbit splitting was also extracted in a similar manner , giving the results @xmath27  mev and @xmath28  mev , respectively .    to obtain predictions of the @xmath2 meson excited state energies , we can now interpolate between the static heavy quark lattice calculations and @xmath29 meson experimental results , i.e. interpolate between the static quark and the charm quark .",
    "linear extrapolation seems to work well , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_interpolation ] . the p - wave states seem to lie near the @xmath30 thresholds .",
    "for evaluating the radial distributions of the light quark a 3-point correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] is needed .",
    "it is defined as @xmath31 this is rather similar to the 2-point correlation function in eq .",
    "[ 2point ] .",
    "we have now two light quark propagators , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and a probe @xmath34 at distance @xmath35 from the static quark ( @xmath36 for the vector ( charge ) and @xmath37 for the scalar ( matter ) distribution ) .    knowing the energies @xmath14 and the amplitudes @xmath15 from the earlier @xmath16 fit , the radial distributions , @xmath38 s , are then extracted by fitting the @xmath39 with @xmath40 the results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ s11 ] and  [ petd ] .",
    "the error bars in these figures show statistical errors only .",
    "see  @xcite and @xcite for earlier calculations .",
    "a simple model based on the dirac equation is used to try to describe the lattice data .",
    "since the mass of the heavy quark is infinite we have essentially a one - body problem .",
    "the potential in the dirac equation has a linearly rising scalar part , @xmath41 , as well as a vector part @xmath42 .",
    "the one gluon exchange potential , @xmath43 , is modified to @xmath44 where @xmath45  mev and the dynamical gluon mass @xmath46  mev ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the potential also has a scalar term @xmath47 , which is needed to increase the energy of higher angular momentum states .",
    "however , this is only a small contribution ( about 30  mev for the f - wave ) .",
    "the solid lines in the radial distribution plots are predictions from the dirac model fit with @xmath48  gev , @xmath49 , @xmath50  gev / fm , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these are treated as free parameters with the values obtained by fitting the ground state energies of p- , d- and f - wave states and the energy of the first radially excited s - wave state ( 2s ) .",
    "note that the excited state energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : espectr ] were not fitted .",
    "* there is an abundance of lattice data , energies and radial distributions , available for this @xmath2-like system . *",
    "the p - wave spin - orbit splitting is small ( essentially zero ) , which supports the symmetry @xmath53 as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the d - wave spin - orbit splitting is clearly non - zero and positive , whereas another lattice group seems to find it to be slightly negative ( see  @xcite ) . * the energies and radial distributions of s- ,",
    "p- and d - wave states can be qualitatively understood by using a one - body dirac equation .",
