    "[ sec : intr ] in the concordance cosmological model ( @xcite ) large spiral galaxies , like the milky way ( mw ) and andromeda ( m31 ) , form in an expanding universe through the aggregation of cold dark matter around an initial seed overdensity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the smallest scale perturbations attract the surrounding matter in the shortest time - scale and thus form their halos first . owing to the higher background density at earlier times ,",
    "these small halos are more dense than their larger counterparts .",
    "they are eventually encompassed by larger halos and some are destroyed by tidal forces causing their dark matter to be dispersed throughout the smooth component of the larger halo .",
    "a portion survive the tidal forces and can be labelled subhalos .",
    "the aquarius project ( @xcite ) is one of the largest cosmological n - body simulations of milky way / andromeda sized dark matter halos , with a thorough investigation of subhalo statistics .",
    "according to their simulations , these subhalos have a more extended distribution around the host halo than the smooth component .",
    "this is inevitable since the subhalos at great distances from the host halo experience weaker tides and are therefore less prone to the culling that the subhalos on short radius orbits encounter .",
    "the mass function of subhalos surrounding the host halo can on average be represented by a power law @xmath6 and typically the most massive subhalos are around one hundredth the mass of the host .",
    "those most massive subhalos also tend to lie beyond the virial radius of the host .",
    "these massive subhalos can also play host to sub - subhalos ( see @xcite ) , which are halos that are bound primarily to the subhalo .",
    "the mass function of these sub - subhalos is similar to that of the subhalos , albeit with a slightly lower normalisation , meaning fewer total satellites per decade of mass .",
    "the distribution of the sub - subhalos has not been precisely quantified and although it may be similar to that of the subhalos , its extent is likely truncated given the tidal forces of the host halo ( which can sunder the sub - subhalo from the subhalo ) .",
    "in addition , sub - subhalos can not be replenished .",
    "it is well known that only a fraction of the possible subhalos of the mw and m31 host satellite galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , some of the most massive predicted subhalos of those two large galaxies do not have corresponding stellar ( luminous ) counterparts .",
    "this means the bright satellite galaxies of the mw and m31 are hosted by subhalos that are much less massive than the most massive ones .",
    "this contradiction is known as the too big to fail ( tbtf ) problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "in essence , if a low mass subhalo is able to accrete gas and form stars with its puny potential well , then so should a more massive subhalo .",
    "a further complication is that roughly half of the detected satellite galaxies orbiting m31 ( see e.g. @xcite ) lie in a highly flattened plane and the majority of those ( 14 out of 16 ) have a common sense of rotation ( @xcite ) - dubbed the vast thin co - rotating ( hereafter vtc ) plane of satellites .",
    "this highly organised distribution is unlikely to be the result of stochastic star formation in certain subhalos ( @xcite and @xcite in response to @xcite ) .",
    "as it happens , the mw has a similar satellite distribution where most satellite galaxies could be part of a highly extended and flattened disk - some 300  kpc in radius with a root mean squared ( rms ) thickness of merely 30  kpc ( @xcite ) . unfortunately , the difficulties involved with measuring proper motions make it challenging to determine if the satellites are co - rotating .",
    "a matter of current debate in the literature is whether co - rotating planes of satellites are found around other large galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is important to confirm since it will determine whether this is a generic property of satellite distributions , or if the local group is simply peculiar . @xcite",
    "have shown that there is evidence of a link between planes of galaxies and satellites within the local group",
    ".    proposed theories to explain this contrived distribution include mergers between m31 and other galaxies ( @xcite ) , which result in tidal dwarf galaxies that would form in a plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , this appears unlikely in a cold dark matter framework due to the implied lack of cold dark matter in the tidal dwarfs , which strongly contradicts inferred dark matter abundances of the observed dwarf spheroidals ( @xcite ) .",
    "another suggestion has been that the satellite galaxies were accreted along filaments that feed the host galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "although all satellites would have coherent motions , the probability of producing the highly ordered system of satellites found in the local group has been argued against by @xcite .",
    "it also offers no explanation for the apparently short duration these satellites have been accreted over .",
    "other studies have suggested it would be difficult to produce the satellite galaxies with low orbital angular momentum in this fashion ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another prospect is for a group of galaxies to be accreted ( @xcite ) .",
    "this would have the interesting property of ensuring the satellite galaxy distribution was relatively compact and has the potential to produce low angular momentum galaxies during the encounter between the host and the group .",
    "this idea was argued against by @xcite on the basis that in the study of @xcite there are no observed galaxy associations that are as thin as the mw s disk of satellites . although it is true that the rms projected radii of the galaxy associations identified by @xcite ( @xmath0  150  kpc ) are far larger than the thickness of the mw s disk of satellites , that does not rule out the possibility that a component of a galaxy group is more compact .",
    "in fact , the majority of the brightest galaxies in each group have a very nearby companion of much lower luminosity , as we demonstrate later .",
    "moreover , the pertinent observation is whether the tight groups proposed by @xcite exist at moderate redshifts .",
    "it is conceivable that a high fraction of all tight groups have been tidally destroyed by redshift zero .",
    "this group infall scenario has regained popularity recently with several studies pointing out the possibility that a reasonable fraction of the local group s satellites originally formed in groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "a further peculiarity with regards to the satellite system of andromeda is that the satellites that are part of the co - rotating thin plane are consistent with lying only in an arch surrounding m31 , they very possibly do not encircle it .",
    "thus , it makes sense to investigate scenarios where the satellites would intrinsically lie in such a distribution . in any case where the satellites fall from a large distance",
    ", they will execute a parabolic orbit .",
    "depending on the impact parameter and the mass of andromeda , this could result in satellites observed mostly in an arch around m31 .",
    "this scenario has to satisfy the 3d positions of the satellites relative to m31 and their line of sight velocity .",
    "here we investigate the likelihood of a variant on the group infall scenario such that , instead of a large group centred on an m33 or lmc size host ( @xcite ) , a subhalo of andromeda along with all of its sub - subhalos form significant quantities of stars and they execute a fly - by orbit that brings them close to m31 . during the close encounter ,",
    "the satellites are strewn out around m31 .",
    "using n - body simulations , we explore the probability that these sub - subhalos now represent the majority of the co - rotating satellites of andromeda that lie in a thin arch .",
    "an idea somewhat similar to this one was simultaneously considered by @xcite who concentrated on a 1:2 mass ratio encounter between two mw / m31 mass galaxies and the survivability of such a co - rotating plane of satellites , but did not concentrate on the likelihood of their scenario reproducing the observed positions and velocities of the observed satellites .",
    "here we explicitly focus on a statistical analysis of our scenario matching the detailed observed properties of m31 s vtc plane of satellites .    in  [ sec : sub ]",
    "we introduce the subhalo scenario and the simulation setup , in  [ sec : compar ] we discuss the satellite sample and their re - orientation to facilitate comparison with the simulations . in  [ sec : res ] we present our statistical comparison of the sub - subhalo distribution with the observed satellite distribution of andromeda and in  [ sec : conc ] we discuss the results and draw our conclusions .",
    "[ sec : sub ] our ansatz is that due to photo - ionisation effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) , only the latest accreted subhalos had substantial numbers of bright sub - subhalo companions .",
    "any subhalos accreted earlier would have suffered from the bright uv halo originating from m31 , stifling the formation of stars in their sub - subhalos .",
    "this would require a sort of patchy re - ionisation , perhaps the kind suggested by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "any subhalo that weighed more than a few percent of the host would similarly quench their own sub - subhalos , and any subhalo weighing much less than 1% of the host would not have a significant , observable sub - subhalo distribution . in principle",
    ", this could leave a reasonably small window of subhalo masses with accompanying , bright sub - subhalos .",
    "the advantage of an accreted subhalo over a generic group is that the sub - subhalo mass function might closely reflect that of the observed satellites in the vtc plane ( see  [ sec : lumfunc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the subhalo might reflect the mass of a larger satellite at the centre of the observed satellite distribution .",
    "a corollary of this is that a significant fraction of galactic satellites could originate from subhalo groups on long period orbits .    in our scenario ,",
    "ngc  205 ( m110 ) was the brightest galaxy of one of m31 s largest subhalos .",
    "thus , the stellar component of ngc  205 sat at the centre of the subhalo .",
    "this subhalo was surrounded by hundreds of sub - subhalos , of which only a fraction ( the most massive ) produced large quantities of stars .",
    "it is our assertion that after a close pericentric passage of m31 , the sub - subhalos were spread out along the orbital direction , but tidally compressed in the direction transverse to the orbit .",
    "if this effect is strong enough , under certain conditions , then this could in principle explain the vtc plane of satellites surrounding m31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ sec : scs ] to visualise the geometry of the scenario , we have plotted two orthogonal views .",
    "the first , shown in fig  [ fig : orbityz ] , is the @xmath7-axis versus the @xmath8-axis , which is the orbital plane that ngc  205 moves in .",
    "the @xmath8-axis is set by the line between the mw ( y , z)=(0  kpc,-783  kpc ) and m31 ( y , z)=(0  kpc,0  kpc ) .",
    "the @xmath7-axis is simply the height above or below m31 .",
    "we test two different scenarios .",
    "the first , which we call scenario 1 , is that ngc 205 began several gyr ago from a position between m31 and the mw .",
    "it initially moved in the positive @xmath7 direction and finally ended now just behind m31 moving in the negative @xmath7 direction .",
    "alternatively , we could have scenario 2 where ngc 205 initially sits several hundred kpc behind m31 and orbits in the negative @xmath7 direction .",
    "it orbits towards m31 and the mw and currently sits before m31 , on the mw s side , and is moving in the positive @xmath7 direction .",
    "the difference between the two scenarios is that ( 1 ) requires ngc 205 to sit just beyond m31 and ( 2 ) just in front of it .",
    "[ sec : d205 ] one might suspect that the uncertainties on the distance to ngc 205 could easily allow both possibilities , however , according to @xcite the distance to ngc 205 using the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method is @xmath9  kpc . using a distance to m31 of @xmath10  kpc",
    "this gives a separation of around 41  kpc and thus a 1@xmath11 range of roughly 14 to 68  kpc ( meaning ngc 205 is behind m31 ) .",
    "alternatively , @xcite give recommended values in their review of distances to andromeda galaxies with larger errors . from their table 4 , the 1@xmath11 range for the separation between m31 and ngc 205 using the trgb is given as -67 to 75  kpc , thus allowing ngc 205 to be in front of or behind m31 .",
    "we thus consider both scenarios .",
    "the majority of the satellite galaxies with @xmath7 coordinate greater than 0 ( or above m31 and ngc 205 ) are moving with a line of sight velocity away from the mw and those with a negative @xmath7 coordinate ( below m31 and ngc 205 ) are mostly moving towards the mw .",
    "kpc ( out of the screen ) .",
    "we show the orbital paths of the two scenarios near pericentre ( 1 with a black line and 2 with a red line).,width=321 ]    the second view , fig  [ fig : orbityx ] , is from the mw towards m31 , showing us the plane of the sky .",
    "here we see the recent orbit of ngc 205 through the thin plane of satellites which has a thickness which is surprisingly small in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "we consider ngc  205 and not m32 because the former s lower velocity relative to m31 makes it a better candidate .",
    "recent observations and theoretical models of m32 suggest it is actually on the milky way s side of m31 ( @xcite ) , but again this distance estimate is likely as uncertain as that of ngc 205 .      to simulate this scenario we make n - body realisations for m31 , ngc  205 and its dark matter subhalos .",
    "m31 and ngc  205 are modelled with four components each : exponential stellar and gaseous disks , a bulge ( @xcite ) and an nfw dark matter halo ( @xcite ) .",
    "we preface this by saying , besides the fairly well constrained dark halo mass of m31 , the only particularly important parameters are the extent of ngc 205 s distribution of sub - subhalos , and its dark halo mass . the baryonic parameters and the details of the dark matter distribution have very little influence on the outcome , but are included to add more realism to the simulations . in table",
    "[ tab : sbpar ] and the following discussion we describe the reference parameters for the mass models .",
    "it is to these values that variations , and references , are made in the remainder of the article .",
    "the m31 parameters were chosen to reflect the measured rotation curve from @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "we use slightly tuned versions of the parameters used by @xcite , in particular a bulge ( as opposed to a hernquist bulge ; @xcite ) with a larger mass to better fit the inner rotation curve .",
    "the total dark halo mass of @xmath13 exceeds that found by the other analyses .",
    "one reason for this is that we do not consider globular clusters or satellites good tracers of the galactic potential , for reasons evident from this article .",
    "the ngc 205 parameters had relatively more freedom since its dynamics are less precisely constrained .",
    "since it has likely suffered from the tidal influence of m31 during the orbit , matching the detailed dynamics using modelling like @xcite or @xcite seemed beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "the parameters for ngc 205 s dark matter halo are simply chosen to give it @xmath01% the mass of m31 s dark matter halo , i.e @xmath14 , to ensure that the stellar component of ngc 205 occupies one of m31 s largest subhalos ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course there is no strict requirement for ngc 205 to occupy the most massive subhalo , so this remains a parameter with a substantial amount of uncertainty .",
    "the radial distribution of the dark matter halo is chosen to give it a similar extent to the most massive subhalos of the aquarius project , thus it is similar to the dark halo profile of m32 from @xcite - which is a comparable dwarf galaxy in terms of its luminosity .",
    "the two most massive subhalos surrounding the @xmath15 host halo ( the same as our dark matter halo mass for m31 ) in @xcite have @xmath16 and 55.3 kpc , whereas @xcite chose @xmath17  kpc .",
    "we use @xmath18  kpc , but again , the extent of the dark matter halo is less relevant than its overall mass since the sub - subhalos orbit at large distances .    for the baryonic components of ngc 205 , nominal values were selected for broad agreement with the luminosity and size . according to @xcite , the v - band magnitude for ngc 205 is -16.5 , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath19 .",
    "these luminosities can often be under - estimated due to insufficiently modelled extinction or the difficult to detect outer surface brightness profile ( @xcite ) , but we assume that these uncertainties are included in the unknown stellar mass - to - light ratio - which we set to @xmath20 ( e.g. @xcite ) . thus the dark matter to baryonic ( stars plus gas ) mass ratio is 18.2 , which is a reasonable value for such a galaxy and is just slightly higher than m31 s value of 16.8 .    the stellar mass of ngc 205 is split almost evenly between bulge and disk ( as @xcite did for m32 ) , even though it is a dwarf elliptical galaxy , since the galaxy might have changed morphology during the orbit .",
    "the exponential scale - heights of the stellar and gaseous disks are found from the scaling relation @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity distributions for all spherical components are sampled from their distribution functions .",
    "the distribution functions are found using potentials that assume a spherical gravitational field for the disks .",
    "the nfw halos are generated using the truncation devised by @xcite where we set @xmath22 .",
    "the disks themselves were initialised using the method of @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that an exponential vertical density distribution is assumed here in place of a @xmath23 distribution .",
    "[ sec : eps ] the final component is the distribution of sub - subhalos surrounding ngc 205 . note that we do not assume that the sub - subhalos trace the dark matter distribution .",
    "instead , we start with the einasto number density distribution of subhalos around their host found by the aquarius project ( @xcite ) , which goes like [ eqn : nsub ] n_sub(-2 ) .",
    "@xcite do not report the distributions of sub - subhalos , presumably because they are quite stochastic .",
    "however , they make it clear that the distribution of sub - subhalos around their subhalo host is not expected to be exactly a scaled down version of eq  [ eqn : nsub ] because of tidal stripping and the fact the sub - subhalos can not easily be restocked , however , it is the most reasonable starting point .",
    "we previously set the virial radius of ngc 205 to @xmath24  kpc . per ",
    "3.2 of @xcite , we define the sub - subhalo distribution by setting @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    the influence of the parameter @xmath27 , as well as the masses of both galaxies dark matter halos and the orbital pericentre are investigated in the results section ( see  [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "the sub - subhalo distribution extends well beyond the virial radius of ngc 205 ( as far as 400  kpc ) .",
    "although the actual number of massive sub - subhalos ( say @xmath28 ) should only be of the order of 100 , we simulate 200k in order to statistically compare with the observed satellites .",
    "again , the velocity distribution is sampled from its distribution function , but the particles ( each representing a sub - subhalo ) are effectively massless .      to demonstrate the stability of the various components , we ran simulations of m31 in isolation and ngc 205 ( with the orbiting sub - subhalos ) in isolation for 10  gyr .",
    "each galaxy was resolved with @xmath29 particles and the particle masses were identical for each mass component .",
    "all simulations were carried out using the gadget-2 n - body code ( @xcite ) .",
    "plots showing the limited evolution of each mass component are given in the appendix ( figs  [ fig : evo1]-[fig : evo3 ] ) .",
    "apart from some thickening of the disk components , the galaxies appear very stable .",
    "of most relevance ,",
    "the dark matter halos are highly stable , as are the sub - subhalos .",
    "to test the hypothesis that the vtc plane of co - rotating satellites originates from a close tidal encounter between m31 and ngc 205 , we need a simulation where such a close encounter occurs . to facilitate this , we give ngc 205 an initial offset of 450  kpc from m31 and a small tangential velocity .",
    "this means ngc 205 is initially at apocentre and will orbit towards a pericentre much closer to m31 , as per fig  [ fig : orbityz ] .",
    "a distance of 450  kpc was chosen to be sufficiently far away to give the tidal forces enough time to work on the sub - subhalo distribution , assuming that any further away the tidal forces would be minimal .",
    "the range of initial tangential velocities we probe are between 25 and 80  @xmath30 . in @xcite",
    "they show ( with the red circles in the bottom right panel of their figure 3 ) the 3d velocity dispersion of subhalos as a function of radius normalised by the peak circular velocity of the dark matter halo ( which here is around 200  @xmath30 ) . extrapolating this velocity dispersion to 2 virial radii should give the 3d velocity dispersion of a subhalo .",
    "since the tangential motion is two out of three of these dimensions , it is reasonable to use the 3d velocity dispersion as an approximation .",
    "thus the expected tangential velocity dispersion for our initial conditions would be somewhere around @xmath31 .",
    "assuming a gaussian distribution for the tangential velocities with the aforementioned tangential velocity dispersion and comparing with the cumulative distribution function , the fraction of orbits within the range of velocities we probe is thus around 0.31 and within a more conservative velocity range of 30 - 65  @xmath30 the fraction is around 0.2 .",
    "thus the velocity ranges we consider are fairly typical of the expected velocities of subhalos that are 2 virial radii from their host .",
    "we also tested larger initial offsets and found no meaningful changes in the outcome .",
    "ideally , this simulation should take place in a cosmological setting , but we assume here that the difference in orbital path and impact velocity are minor .    what is of relevance is not the initial offset , although this must be large enough to produce a suitable pericentric velocity , but rather the pericentre , or impact parameter . in order to affect different pericentric distances , or impact parameters",
    ", we simply vary the initial tangential velocity of ngc 205 . throughout the full orbit , but with greater cadence once ngc 205 is near pericentre , we compare the simulated positions and velocities of the sub - subhalos with the observed satellites of m31 .",
    "[ sec : compar ]      for the statistical comparison between the simulated sub - subhalos and the satellites , one of the key questions is which satellite galaxies to include .",
    "the satellite galaxies that @xcite showed to be located in a vast , thin ( but not exclusively co - rotating ) plane around m31 are m32 , ngc 147 , 185 , 205 and and i , iii , ix , xi , xii , xiii , xiv , xvi , xvii , xxv , xxvi , xxvii & xxx ( also known as c2 ) . and xxxii & lgs 3 , which are catalogued by @xcite ,",
    "are not included since they lie beyond the pan andromeda ( panda ) footprint where the vicinity is not fully surveyed .",
    "we do not include m32 since it is too massive to be part of the ngc 205 group .",
    "it is thus a shortcoming of our scenario and m32 would have to be an interloper .",
    "alternatively , it could be bound to ngc 205 and co - orbiting with it like the two magellanic clouds . or , it could be in a short period orbit of m31 given its small offset and line of sight velocity .",
    "ngc 205 is obviously not included because it is a prior of the statistical calculation that it be close to the origin in the vtc plane .",
    "four other satellites are handled on a case by case basis since , mainly for the line of sight velocity , they are less consistent than the others and we wish to gauge how significant their inclusion or exclusion is . and",
    "xiii and and xxvii do not share the same sense of rotation as the other satellites and are thus highly unlikely to be prior members of the subhalo group .",
    "similarly , although and xii & xxvi orbit with the correct orbital sense , their velocities appear somewhat less consistent with the scenario than the remaining 11 .    on the one hand , these counter rotating satellites mean that our explanation for the thin disk of co - rotating satellites is incomplete .",
    "the alignment of and xiii & xxvii with the plane of satellites would have to be coincidental . on the other , this would have to be the case for the majority of models attempting to explain the origin of the vtc plane of satellites , even modified gravity models creating tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we still include them in our analysis of the likelihood of having so many satellites in a thin plane since even if they do not originate from a subhalo group centred on ngc 205 , their coincidental alignment with the plane must be accounted for statistically .    therefore , we have 13 satellite galaxies that are part of the vtc plane ( including ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and xii , and and xxvi ) ; another 2 ( and xiii and and xxvii ) that are in the plane , but not co - rotating ; m31 and ngc 205 , which are expected to be there as the prior of the scenario ; and m32 which is assumed to be in a short period orbit of m31 and therefore neglected .      [",
    "sec : lumfunc ]    the advantage of using ngc 205 as the subhalo host of a distribution of sub - subhalos is that we have a reasonable expectation of the mass function of sub - subhalos . in fig  19 of @xcite",
    ", they show the cumulative mass function of sub - subhalos within several subhalos with each panel displaying a different subhalo . in fig",
    "[ fig : lumfunc ] we show the observed cumulative luminosity function for the 11 satellite galaxies we assume comprised the subhalo group that became the vtc plane of satellites .",
    "this group excludes ngc 147 and 185 since they are too massive to be sub - subhalos bound to ngc 205 , as well as and xiii & xxvii since they are counter rotating .",
    "the former two satellites are often considered to be tidally bound to each other ( however , see @xcite ) , but are far too bright to have formed in the subhalo of ngc 205 , i.e. to be associated with a sub - subhalo .",
    "the most logical explanation would be that they are each associated with another , less massive subhalo of m31 and became bound to ngc 205 during their orbit towards m31 , similar to the lmc and the smc and ngc  147 & 185 themselves .",
    "the luminosities for each galaxy are taken from the updated list of @xcite . over the luminosity function of the observed satellite galaxies we plot the simulated mass function of sub - subhalos for a specifically chosen subhalo from @xcite , assuming that the ratio between satellite and host luminosity equals their dark matter halo mass ratios",
    "this is the second subhalo group from their fig  19 and it is given a red line as per the original plot . to a large extent",
    "this simulated mass function resembles the observed luminosity function , thus we can say there is some evidence to suggest the luminosity function of the observed satellite galaxies is representative of the expected mass function of sub - subhalos from simulations .",
    "we also overplot the standard mass function of subhalos around a host galaxy ( blue line ) , which can of course be determined with far greater precision .          the observed distribution of satellite galaxies that belong to the co - rotating plane of satellites , as shown in fig  1 of @xcite , is not exactly aligned with the vertical direction on the graph .",
    "our simulations are setup such that ngc 205 and m31 are initially separated along the @xmath8 direction and movement is exclusively in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane ( see our figs  [ fig : orbityz]-[fig : orbityx ] )",
    ". therefore , ngc 205 has no motion in the @xmath12 direction and our key comparison is between the @xmath12 distribution of the satellites and sub - subhalos . to make comparison with the simulations easier , we simply rotate the observed satellites around the origin in the @xmath12-@xmath7 plane , which is chosen to be m31 . in fig",

    "the rotation angle that minimises the rms distance from the median @xmath12 position of the observed satellites is 15.6@xmath32 and we rotate all satellites in the @xmath12-@xmath7 plane by this angle and subtract the median @xmath12 value for all satellites .",

    "we do this to place the origin close to the centre of the vtc plane of satellites , but importantly midway between the two satellites with the smallest distance from the plane ( i.e. smallest @xmath33 values ) .",
    "this shift is important because if we place one satellite at @xmath34 it becomes meaningless to compute how many simulated sub - subhalos have a smaller @xmath33-coordinate value .",
    "this means that the observed ngc 205 sits at ( @xmath35 , @xmath36  kpc ) and half the satellites have larger @xmath7 values and half have lower . the observed m31 is at ( @xmath37  kpc , @xmath38  kpc ) and the @xmath12 coordinate is the only one ( including @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath39 ) for which m31 is not central . in the simulations we ignore this subtlety and set @xmath34  kpc for m31 .",
    "the extra constraint we have is that ngc 205 is currently moving with line of sight velocity relative to m31 of @xmath40 and therefore the ideal instant to make any statistical comparison is when the simulated ngc 205 has its observed @xmath7 and @xmath39 values .",

    "and@xmath72 we only plot the values for the 13 co - rotating satellites to avoid clutter .",
    "it is worth noting that the typical value one finds for sampling the 13 satellites from a typical _ subhalo _ distribution around an m31 sized galaxy is around 1000 for @xmath72 and @xmath74 for @xmath73 , whereas values @xmath75 and @xmath76 are easily achievable for the _ sub - subhalos _ at pericentre .",
    "this simply means the sub - subhalo scenario is intrinsically more likely .",
    "for the bottom two rows of fig  [ fig : scen3 ] there are large differences between scenario 1 and 2 for the preferred initial tangential velocity .",
    "the key tension with the preferred parameters for only producing a thin disk of satellites , is the scaling of the sub - subhalo distribution .",
    "this arises because the observed satellites are relatively spread out around the trajectory of the turquoise dots in fig  [ fig : vzy ] and therefore a few satellites can only be surrounded by a sizeable density of sub - subhalos if the sub - subhalos are spread out more .",

    "the probabilities are not adversely affected by the counter - rotating satellites .",
    "the probability increases with higher ngc 205 masses , lower m31 masses and larger radial scalings of the sub - subhalos distribution which is the exact opposite of what was found for the @xmath12 distribution .",
    "the trend of probability with initial tangential velocity changes from scenario 1 to 2 , but velocities @xmath82 seem preferred for scenario 2 .    for the @xmath39-@xmath7 plane",
    "the key difference is that a larger mass for m31 is favoured .",
    "there is not too much variation in probability with initial tangential velocity for scenario 2 , although @xmath64 seems ideal . for scenario 1",
    "velocities less than @xmath64 and greater than @xmath62 are disfavoured .",
    "it appears the most important parameter for this plane is simply the radial scaling of the sub - subhalo distribution : see simulations 24 - 27 where the scaling goes from 100% -200% of the original size ; and 14 - 16 , 17 - 19 & 20 - 22 where it goes from 80% - 120% for three different initial tangential velocities .",
    "the main reason for this is that the spreading out of the sub - subhalos allows the distribution to overlap with the dispersion of satellites in this plane which produces some moderate outliers ( and xii & and xxvi ) .",
    "the probabilities for scenario 2 are generally slightly larger than scenario 1 .",
    "a few simulations in scenario 1 have no measurable probability of even generating the 11 core satellites and very few simulations are able to match the observations well enough to have measurable probabilities when trying to account for 13 satellites .",
    "it seems this is only possible for larger masses of m31 and more extended sub - subhalo distributions .",
    "in fact , it seems like increasing the mass of m31 to 125% of the reference mass for simulations 23 - 29 ( and 150% for simulation 13 ) is the key parameter for producing a better match to all 13 co - rotating observed satellites .",
    "this follows because a larger mass for m31 leads to a larger tidally induced spread in sub - subhalo velocities .",
    "an interesting result is that decreasing the radial extent of the sub - subhalos and the mass of ngc 205 leads to increases in the probability of generating a very thin distribution of satellites , however it also leads to dramatic decreases in the probability of reproducing the satellites in the @xmath39-@xmath7 plane .    in the last row",
    "we combine the two probabilities from the first two rows .",
    "this gives no consideration of the @xmath8-@xmath7 positions , but the combination of measurement uncertainties for the line of sight distances and the general spread in the simulated sub - subhalo distribution should make this a relatively minor correction .",
    "these two panels in the last row show a clear preference for certain initial tangential velocities , with @xmath64 standing out for scenario 2 .",
    "it also hints at a threshold mass for both m31 and ngc 205 below which the probability is negligible .",
    "probably the key factor is still the scaling of the sub - subhalo distribution with extended distributions preferred .",
    "the result of these probability studies is that despite the simulations broadly agreeing with the general patterns in the phase space distribution of the satellites , the probabilities recovered suggest the situation is more intricate than our simple model .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that the scenario is generally plausible , meaning that it is possible to sample as thin a distribution of sub - subhalos and the observed distribution of line of sight velocities and positions , but the resulting probabilities are low .",
    "we discuss below possible factors that may complicate the scenario .",
    "the radial extent of the distribution of sub - subhalos is not necessarily a simple scaled - down version of the subhalo distribution around m31 ( or the milky way ) .",
    "tidal forces from m31 might truncate the sub - subhalo distribution at high redshifts and this more concentrated distribution would change the probabilities .",
    "alternatively , our choice of @xmath83 and also @xmath84 might underestimate the extent of the sub - subhalo distribution insofar as the probability of star formation in a sub - subhalo might be linked to that sub - subhalo s orbit .",
    "probably a more significant factor is just that the radial distribution of sub - subhalos is stochastic and varies significantly from subhalo to subhalo and on top of that is anisotropic to some degree .",
    "there is also the possibility that in - transit encounters have affected the distribution of sub - subhalos . in particular , a scattering from m33 might have changed the orbit and also disturbed the sub - subhalo distribution meaning that a smooth distribution like we present here would struggle account for the resulting orbits . in the same vein , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : lumfunc ] the two larger satellites ngc 147 and ngc 185 are too massive to be members of the subhalo group of ngc 205 .",
    "the most obvious reason for their proximity is that they became loosely bound to the group . in principle",
    "their interaction with the group could also cause some minor variations in the velocities of the other satellites making them less ordered than our simulations suggest .",
    "in addition , m32 s presence might have caused similar deviations from our predictions .",
    "another factor that has gained much attention recently is that any peculiarities in the local group , and deviations from expectations derived from simulations , might arise because the local group is composed of a pair of massive galaxies in close proximity .",
    "many recent simulations like @xcite make sure to focus only on areas of cosmological simulations with local group analogs when making comparisons between observations of the milky way or m31 and simulated halos .",
    "several papers ( for example @xcite ) look specifically at the exchange of satellites between m31 and the mw .",
    "there is clearly a continual interaction between these two galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , this probably has little influence on the detailed probabilities of our scenario , but it could have important implications for the frequency of the interloping , counter - rotating satellites .    most of these factors , in particular the initial , anisotropic distribution of sub - subhalos and the influence of in - transit encounters , would be automatically taken into account in cosmological simulations and that is clearly where more concrete answers must be sought .",
    "the line of sight velocities of the simulated sub - subhalos are relatively small for objects near pericentre that have orbited from a large distance .",
    "this is of course because the motion is mostly in the plane of the sky . for the initial velocities ( pericentres ) of 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 50 , 60 and 80  @xmath30 ( 19 , 24.5 , 31 , 37 , 52 , 72 and 126  kpc )",
    "the motions in the plane of the sky at pericentre are roughly 530 , 500 , 460 , 435 , 390 , 350 and 270  @xmath30 respectively .",
    "if measured , these large proper motions could provide a strong constraint on the scenario . away from pericentre",
    ", these velocities would drop quickly meaning that the proper motions of the satellites , relative to m31 , should decrease with @xmath7 coordinate and ngc 205 should have the largest value .",
    "such large orbital velocities are not unheard of in the local group .",
    "the magellanic clouds , in particular the large magellanic cloud at @xmath85 , have very large tangential velocities relative to the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ sec : galass ] it has been argued that observed galaxy associations are too sparse or loose to explain the vtc plane of satellites .",
    "the absolute v - band magnitudes of ngc 205 and the brightest satellite in the co - rotating thin plane , and i , are -16.5 and -11.9 - a difference of 4.6 .",
    "@xcite presented the members of several galaxy associations that are independent of both each other and of andromeda .",
    "ngc 3109 has a companion galaxy with b - band magnitude difference of 6.2 and projected distance of 25  kpc . according to @xcite",
    ", it has a second dwarf companion at @xmath072  kpc . of the remaining four groups with satellites that are more than 3 magnitudes dimmer than their host",
    ", three have companions with projected distances less than 45 kpc ( 32 , 40.5 and 43.5 kpc ) and magnitude differences between 5.1 and 7 .",
    "one system does not have an observed nearby companion .",
    "since these companion galaxies are typically at the observable threshold , it seems perfectly plausible that other , dimmer , nearby companions are present .    a common question is the location of these groups around m31 ( or the milky way ) , since others must have fallen in .",
    "the first point is there are only a handful of lmc / smc or ngc 205/m32 sized halos expected from simulations . from the aquarius project",
    "there are 5 halos more massive than @xmath86 and another 7 more massive than @xmath87 . of those , the earlier accreted subhalos",
    "might not have had a distribution of bright sub - subhalos due to their proximity to m31 .",
    "furthermore , there is clearly not a bounty of smc / ngc 205 sized halos being accreted given that after the smc and lmc , the milky way has no massive nearby satellites .    another related question , which we plan to investigate , is the survival of other disks of satellites . in particular , how long does it take to tidally destroy all satellites after infall ?",
    "[ sec : conc ] in this article we explored the idea that andromeda s vast , thin plane of co - rotating satellites is formed by the tidal break - up of a subhalo group during a close pericentric passage of m31 .",
    "ngc 205 was assumed to be the galaxy at the centre of the subhalo and it was initially surrounded by many bright sub - subhalos .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of @xcite who found the majority of independent nearby groups have a host and bright satellite ( comparable to ngc  205 and and i ) within a projected distance of 25 and 45  kpc of each other . deeper imaging is required to see if the dimmer satellites are present ( @xcite ) .",
    "we showed that the observed luminosity function of the subhalo group , which we propose dispersed into the vast thin plane of satellites , is compatible with the mass function of sub - subhalos from the simulations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , an advantage of this subhalo group scenario is that it could go some way to mitigating the tbtf problem , since only sub - subhalos / satellites that are part of certain subhalo groups are lit up .    using standard parameters , we made n - body models for m31 , ngc 205 and 200k point particles representing the sub - subhalos which initially orbit ngc 205 .",
    "ngc 205 and the sub - subhalos initially began from a distance of around two times m31 s virial radius and orbited towards m31 with a range of different initial velocities tangential to m31 .",
    "the initial tangential velocity range was fairly typical of subhalo velocities from cosmological simulations . during the pericentric passage",
    ", the sub - subhalos were spread out in the orbital direction , but they were compressed in the transverse direction .",
    "this greatly improved the visual agreement with the observed distribution of satellites .    to compare the distribution of sub - subhalos with that of the observed satellites in the @xmath12-direction ( the distance perpendicular to the vast thin plane ) we used a ks test and a monte carlo sampling method . for these tests we used all 15 observed satellites including the 13 members of the vtc plane of satellites and the 2 counter - rotating satellites .",
    "we made all comparisons when the simulated location and line of sight velocity of ngc 205 agreed with the observed ones .",
    "specifically , @xmath12 , @xmath7 and @xmath39 were identical , but the line of sight distance @xmath8 from m31 depended on the initial tangential velocity .",
    "we performed a series of simulations with different initial conditions facilitated by changing the initial tangential velocity ( to give a different pericentre ) , the masses of ngc 205 or m31 and also the radial extent of the sub - subhalo distribution .",
    "the lowest ks - test statistics were found near pericentre , which ngc 205 is currently close to , and for the majority of our simulation parameter - space the null hypothesis , that the sub - subhalo distribution and the observed satellites come from the same parent distribution , could not be rejected at any reasonable confidence level . the monte carlo sampling method to determine the probability of drawing a distribution of sub - subhalos from our simulation that is thinner than the observed satellite plane gave a probability that varied significantly with the radial extent of the sub - subhalos , the pericentre and the mass of ngc  205 s dark matter halo . using the reference distribution of sub - subhalos and mass for ngc 205 we found the highest probability of producing a plane of satellites as thin as the observed 15 satellites was around 1% .",
    "although the thin distribution of observed satellites in the @xmath12-direction is the most apparent concern , the highly extended distribution of observed satellites in the plane of the sky ( @xmath7-direction ) is also troubling . to this end",
    ", we made a similar calculation of the probability of producing as extended a distribution satellites in the plane of the sky , but found that this depended critically on the size of the area that is excluded from sampling due to m31 saturating its surroundings and the chosen outer limits of the sampled region .",
    "we also calculated the probability of agreement between the observed satellites and our simulations with monte carlo sampling of two combinations ( 1 ) the observed line of sight velocities with the @xmath7 distribution , and ( 2 ) the @xmath12-@xmath7 plane ( the plane of the sky ) .",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath7 easily gave probabilities greater than 0.1 for many sets of simulation parameters .",
    "the @xmath39-@xmath7 plane showed very good visual agreement , bolstered by a self - devised quantity for the likelihood of the satellites relative to the simulated sub - subhalos , discussed in  [ sec : eps ] .",
    "however , the details of the satellite phase space distribution made a convincing match difficult .",
    "ignoring the two counter - rotating satellites , the probability is still very low - at best around @xmath88 unless the radial extent of the sub - subhalos is inflated by 50% or more .",
    "such a tactic can increase the probability by a factor of 10 or more , but this in turn reduces the probability of randomly finding 15 satellites with very small distances perpendicular to the vtc plane . ignoring two other marginal outliers ( leaving 11 satellites ) improves the best probabilities to @xmath89 for the reference scaling of the sub - subhalo distribution and up to @xmath90 for a mere 20% increase in that parameter . if those two outliers must be included then a slightly larger mass ( at least 125% of the reference value ) for m31 is required .",
    "although the probabilities we find for this scenario are seemingly low , they are still competitive with other models .",
    "we argue that this may simply have to do with our model not being sophisticated enough to include potential encounters with other galaxies along the orbit , such as m33 , or simply m32 , ngc 147 and ngc 185 .",
    "such encounters would inject a random component into the phase space distribution of sub - subhalos .",
    "other complications might be that certain satellites are simply interlopers , or the initial sub - subhalo distribution is slightly anisotropic .",
    "another factor that would increase the probability would be if there are as yet undiscovered satellites close to m31 , within our excluded region of 40  kpc .",
    "we expect around 10 such undetected dwarf galaxies .",
    "thus this scenario seems like an interesting candidate for explaining the bulk of the vast thin plane of co - rotating satellites and can not yet be ruled out .",
    "there are still complexities that might be very important that are not accounted for here and really require high spatial and temporal resolution cosmological simulations such as the caterpillar suite ( @xcite ) and elvis suite ( exploring the local volume in simulations ; @xcite ) , the latter of which crucially focuses on binary local group analogs",
    ".    it will also be interesting to see how the scenario plays out for the milky way satellite system , the detected plane of satellites around centaurus a ( @xcite ) , as well as a second plane of satellites in andromeda ( @xcite ) .",
    "to explain the second plane in andromeda there would need to be a separate encounter between a subhalo group of galaxies and m31 .",
    "this implies that all low mass satellite galaxies form in sub - subhalos and their locations are caused by encounters with the host that separated them from their subhalo host .",
    "to close we re - emphasise the various assumptions on which this scenario rests , which are also predictions .",
    "a.   halos like the milky way , m31 , lmc or m33 with @xmath91 inhibit the star formation in their own nearby subhalos , or tidally disrupt them .",
    "b.   only subhalos that fell from ( or at least orbited to ) well outside m31 s virial radius formed large quantities of stars . c.   there is a subhalo mass window , @xmath92 , for which basically all bound",
    "sub - subhalos formed significant numbers of stars .",
    "d.   the vast majority of galaxies with @xmath93 do not form in isolation , but within the sub - subhalos of a subhalo group .",
    "e.   every separate plane of satellites is caused by a distinct encounter between a subhalo group and a host galaxy .",
    "f.   m32 , and xiii & xxvii are interlopers of the vtc plane of satellites .",
    "g.   there should be around 10 undetected satellites within 40  kpc of m31 .",
    "h.   ngc 147 & 185 , which are gravitationally bound to each other , were also dragged by ( or led ) ngc 205 towards m31 .",
    "i.   field dwarf ellipticals with @xmath92 should have observable dwarf satellites with the same luminosity function and spatial distribution as discussed here ( following @xcite ) .",
    "j.   for reasonable parameters , and ignoring the other coordinates , the chance of producing as thin a distribution of satellites as the observed vtc plane at pericentre is less than roughly 1% , therefore such ultra - thin distributions should not be found around a statistically significant proportion of andromeda sized galaxies .",
    "k.   the proper motions of ngc 205 and the dwarf galaxies comprising the vtc plane of satellites should be large .",
    "for example , ngc 205 should have a plane of the sky motion of at least 300  @xmath30 relative to m31 .",
    "this was also predicted by @xcite to explain ngc 205 s tidal features .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : sims ]",

    "here we present supplementary figures that are referenced in the main text .",
    "in addition to the monte carlo sampling performed in  [ sec : pmc2 ] , we sought a simpler method to gauge which simulation snapshot , or set of initial conditions , best matches the observed @xmath39-@xmath7 and @xmath8-@xmath7 positions of the satellites .",
    "we began by finding the continuous series of points in both planes which are the coordinates close to the centre of the turquoise band of sub - subhalos .",
    "these were selected by finding the highest density of points along the @xmath95-axis ( either the @xmath39 or @xmath8 coordinate ) at every 5  kpc in the @xmath7 coordinate ( see the black lines in figs  [ fig : vzy ] & [ fig : zy ] ) . for each satellite position ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) , there is a coordinate ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) , which is a point on the black line of fig  [ fig : vzy ] ( or [ fig : zy ] for the @xmath8-@xmath7 plane ) , that minimises the  distance \" , @xmath100 to the satellite .",
    "of course , the weighting of the two coordinates , @xmath39 and @xmath7 , is important , but since @xmath7 spans roughly 300  kpc and @xmath39 spans roughly @xmath101 we simply chose to weight by 1  kpc and 1  @xmath30 .",
    "crucially , the path of the turquoise band changes depending on the initial conditions .    to give a rough estimate",
    "of which set of initial conditions and which orbital scenario ( 1 or 2 ) gives the better match to the observed satellites in the @xmath39-@xmath7 plane , we computed a figure of merit @xmath102 which is calculated by taking each observed satellite in turn and counting how many sub - subhalos , @xmath103 , are in a thin bar of 10  kpc thickness between it and the point ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) - that was determined above using the minimum distance criterion - on the black line in fig  [ fig : vzy ] , and how many are beyond it , called @xmath104 . we use this to find the @xmath94 of that point from the inverse error function of @xmath105 .",
    "we square and sum this quantity over all 13 satellites and divide by 13 and take the square root .",
    "this should give an indication of the probability of finding a satellite at a certain separation from the turquoise band .",
    "in fig  [ fig : eps ] we plot the variation of @xmath106 for the reference simulation with time near pericentre with black lines that correspond to the left hand @xmath50-axis .",
    "we do this for both scenario 1 ( solid line ) and 2 ( dashed line ) . for both scenarios there",
    "is a factor of two improvement at pericentre over the original value .",
    "we computed another figure of merit which was again based on the mean path of the simulated sub - subhalos in the @xmath8-@xmath7 plane ( the black line in fig  [ fig : zy ] ) .",
    "we call this @xmath107 , but adopted a different approach because of the larger potential uncertainty in the @xmath8 measurements for each satellite .",
    "first we find the point ( @xmath108 , @xmath99 ) on the black line which has the same @xmath7 coordinate as the satellite position ( @xmath109 , @xmath97 ) and then we compute the variance of @xmath110 from @xmath111 based on the uncertainty of @xmath111 i.e. @xmath112 .",
    "we sum these values for all satellites , then divide by and take the square root .",
    "we also plot the variation of @xmath107 with time in fig  [ fig : eps ] with blue lines corresponding to the right hand @xmath50-axis .",
    "scenario 2 ( dashed line ) seems to be slightly more consistent with the distribution of the satellites in this plane .",
    "-axis are the @xmath94-like figures of merit discussed in ",
    "[ sec : eps ] for the match between the observed satellites and simulated sub - subhalos in the @xmath39-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the blue lines , which correspond to the right hand @xmath50-axis are similar figures of merit for the @xmath8-@xmath7 plane .",
    "the solid lines refer to scenario 1 and the dashed lines to scenario 2.,width=321 ]    for the two panels of fig  [ fig : epssim ] which show @xmath107 and @xmath102 we use black for scenario 1 and red for scenario 2 .",
    "there is little improvement from scenario 1 to 2 as long as the initial tangential velocity is less than @xmath82 .",
    "an initial tangential velocity of @xmath82 or greater for scenario 1 is disfavoured . from the right hand panel",
    "there is a slight preference for scenario 2 , especially for larger pericentres .",
    "however , for scenario 1 , most pericentres are consistent with even the most stringent distance uncertainties for ngc 205 .",
    "for scenario 2 , the larger the pericentre the more tension there is with the measured distance and its reliability ."
