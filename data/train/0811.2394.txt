    "the study of exclusive reactions in the generalized bjorken regime has been the scene of significant progresses in the recent years , thanks to the factorization properties of the leading twist amplitudes @xcite for deeply virtual compton scattering and deep exclusive meson production .",
    "it however turned out that transversally polarized rho meson production did not enter the leading twist controlable case @xcite but only the twist 3 more intricate part of the amplitude @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the quark - gluon structure of a transversally polarized vector meson is however an important task of hadronic physics if one cares about studying confinement dynamics .",
    "this quark gluon structure may be described by distribution amplitudes which have been discussed in great detail @xcite . on the experimental side",
    ", a continuous effort has been devoted to the exploration of @xmath2 photo and electro - production , from moderate to very large energy .",
    "the kinematical analysis of the final meson pair allows then to separate the different helicity amplitudes , hence to measure the transversally polarized @xmath3 meson production amplitude . although non - dominant for deep electroproduction , this amplitude is by no means negligible and needs to be understood in terms of qcd . up to now , experimental information comes from electroproduction on a proton or nucleus .",
    "future progress may come from real or virtual photon photon collisions , which may be accessible either at electron positron colliders or in ultraperipheral collisions at hadronic colliders , as recently discussed @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the description of high energy reactions such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 where the virtual photons carry large squared momenta @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 , and the mandelstam variable @xmath9 obeys the condition @xmath10 . neglecting meson masses ,",
    "one considers for reaction ( [ prgg ] ) the light cone vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the vector meson momenta ( @xmath13 ) ; the `` plus '' light cone direction is directed along @xmath11 and the `` minus '' light cone direction along @xmath12 with vector @xmath14 defined as @xmath15 . in this sudakov light - cone basis ,",
    "transverse euclidian momenta are denoted with underlined letters .",
    "the virtual photon momentum @xmath16 reads @xmath17 .",
    "the impact representation of the scattering amplitude for the reaction ( [ prgg ] ) is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the 4-gluons green function which obeys the bfkl equation .",
    "@xmath19 reduces to @xmath20 within born approximation .",
    "we focus here on the @xmath21 impact factor @xmath22 of the subprocess @xmath23 which is the integral of the @xmath24-channel discontinuity of the s - matrix element @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the mandelstam variable @xmath9 for the subprocess ( [ ggsubpr ] ) .",
    "note that the two reggeized gluons have so - called non - sense polarizations @xmath28 considering now the forward limit for simplicity , the gluon momenta read @xmath29    the impact factor @xmath22 can be calculated within the collinear factorization .",
    "it is a convolution of perturbatively calculable hard - scattering amplitudes @xmath30 and soft correlators @xmath31 involving relevant @xmath3-meson distribution amplitudes , symbolically written as @xmath32\\,,\\ ] ] integrating over the @xmath14 ( @xmath33 ) body phase - space . working within the light - cone collinear factorization framework ,",
    "let us first derive the contribution of the diagrams with the quark - antiquark correlators .",
    "the basic tool is to decompose any hard coefficient function @xmath34 around a dominant  plus \" direction : @xmath35 where the first term is associated with the usual twist-@xmath36 contribution while the term with the derivative with the kinematical twist @xmath1 .",
    "after fourier transform , this second hard term is accompanied in ( [ factorisation ] ) by a soft correlator involving derivatives of the fields .",
    "these contributions are shown on fig.[fig1]a ( no transverse derivatives ) , and fig.[fig1]b ( with transverse derivatives ) .",
    "this allows us to factorize the amplitude in the momentum space . after a fierz decomposition of the dirac matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ", the amplitude takes , up to higher twist terms , the simple factorized form symbolically written as : @xmath39 \\ , s_{q \\bar{q}}^\\gamma ( x ) + \\hbox{tr }   \\left [ \\partial_{\\perp } h_{q \\bar{q}}(x\\ , p   ) \\ , \\gamma \\right ] \\ ,   \\partial_{\\perp}s_{q \\bar{q}}^\\gamma ( x ) \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 stands for some @xmath41-matrix from a full set and the soft part reads symbolically @xmath42 within twist 3 order , the correlators which need to be parameterized are thus and @xmath43 denote 2 and 3-body relative fourier transforms along @xmath44 @xcite @xmath45\\ , , \\\\ \\label{par1a } & & \\langle \\rho(p)| \\bar\\psi(z)\\gamma_5\\gamma_{\\mu } \\psi(0 ) |0\\rangle \\stackrel{{\\cal f}_1}{=}m_\\rho \\ , f_\\rho \\ , i\\varphi_a(x)\\ , \\varepsilon_{\\mu\\lambda\\beta\\delta}\\ , e^{*t}_{\\lambda}\\ , p_{\\beta } \\ , n_{\\delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , for the quark - antiquark operators with the transverse derivatives , @xmath46 a careful treatment of the correlators needs to take into account the equations of motion for the fermion field which read @xmath47 , and the corresponding one for the antifermion field , where @xmath48 .",
    "this shows that one must also consider diagrams such as the one shown on fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , d , with the three body quark - antiquark - gluon nonlocal operators .",
    "one parameterizes these new non - perturbative objects as @xmath49 where fractions",
    "@xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to the quark , antiquark and gluon .",

    "this is satisfied when using the equations of motion .",
