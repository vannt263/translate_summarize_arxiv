    "it is of great physical significance that about 10% - 15% of quasars show broad absorption line ( loosely defined as absorbing gas that is blue shifted at least 5,000 km / s relative to the qso rest frame and displaying a spread in velocity of at least 2,000 km / s ) outflows @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that all radio quiet quasars have bal flows , but the designation of a quasar as a balqso depends on whether the line of sight intersects the solid angle subtended by the outflow .",
    "the standard model of quasars is one of a hot accretion flow onto a black hole and a surrounding torus of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "a very popular model of the balqsos is an equatorial wind driven from the luminous disk that is viewed at low latitudes , just above the molecular gas @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can have a bipolar bal flow that conforms with the observations @xcite .",
    "however , balqsos are so distant that direct imaging of the bal region is beyond the resolution of current optical telescopes .",
    "thus , much of the discussion of bal geometry is based on deductive reasoning . in this letter , we implement observations of nearby bal systems in order to achieve the high resolution necessary to determine the geometry directly .",
    "in particular , we discuss new observations of the nearest balqso mrk 231 .",
    "recently , new studies of the x - ray binary circinus x-1 has changed our perspective .",
    "circinus x-1 has p cygni absorption profiles in the x - rays associated with a high velocity broad absorption line flow .",
    "thus , the accretion disk of circinus x-1 has been considered a galactic example of a broad absorption line quasar @xcite .",
    "radio observations of circinus x-1 have now indicated jet outflow velocities of 15 c @xcite .",
    "this can only occur for a relativistic flow that is viewed within a few degrees of the axis of the jet @xcite .",
    "the galactic example of a broad absorption line quasar is therefore viewed pole - on .",
    "the findings on circinus x-1 raise the question , are bal qsos being viewed close to the black hole spin axis ?",
    "we begin this empirical analysis of bal geometry by studying the wealth of new x - ray data on balqsos .",
    "a picture seems to be emerging that shows thompson thick absorbing columns to the x - ray source . in the most realistic models of equatorial outflows , @xcite",
    ", thompson thick columns are catastrophic because they block the uv photons form accelerating the bal region outward .",
    "thus , the new x - ray observations indicate that high velocity equatorial bal winds as we know them can not be attained in many balqsos . in order to determine the geometry of a true balqso",
    ", one must turn to the nearest example in order to achieve adequate resolution , mrk 231 . fortunately",
    ", mrk 231 also has a radio jet that is powerful enough to be imaged on pc scales . in this letter",
    ", we combine vlbi mapping of the jet with 2-d spectroscopy of mrk 231 to show that both the radio jet and the bal region flow outward from the nucleus along pa @xmath4 .",
    "the x - ray flux from the quasar tends to over - ionize gas the atoms in a putative bal outflow , preventing resonant absorption and the resultant line driving force . in a breakthrough paper of @xcite",
    ", it was shown that if the quasar x - rays were shielded , a line driven wind was possible from the accretion disk which they argued was preferable to an outflow of dense bal clouds and the associated confinement problems .",
    "the earliest x - ray observations of balqsos supported the notion of x - ray shielding gas . rosat",
    "soft x - ray measurements indicated that balqsos were x - ray suppressed relative to other quasars @xcite .",
    "numerically , further evidence was found in @xcite in which models naturally produced a shield of x - ray emitting gas between the central radiation source and the high velocity winds . in this section",
    ", we consider the most recent x - ray observations and their application to the details of the shielding gas .",
    "the rosat observations of balqsos indicated that x - ray absorbing columns @xmath5 were quite typical @xcite .",
    "however , as observations at higher energy , higher sensitivity and higher resolution have become available estimates of these absorbing columns have increased dramatically .",
    "this essentially is a consequence of the fact that at @xmath6 the absorbing column is essentially black to soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "one needs higher energy x - ray measurements to learn more .",
    "secondly , the fluxes from the balqso nucleus are so attenuated that they can be swamped by any nearby x - ray source .",
    "thus , high resolution telescopes such as xmm are valuable .",
    "we illustrate these points with a couple of examples .",
    "the prototypical balqso is phl5200 .",
    "deep asca observations indicated an absorbing column of @xmath7 @xcite . however , deeper high resolution imaging with xmm in @xcite indicated that the poor resolution of asca allowed x - rays from a background radio source to flood the detectors .",
    "only a small percentage of the total x - ray flux were attributable to phl 5200 .",
    "there were not even enough photons detected in @xmath8 ksec to determine the spectral properties and the absorption .",
    "one thing that is certain , the absorbing column is clearly significantly larger than the asca value of @xmath9 and therefore thompson thick .",
    "next we review the x - ray data on mrk 231 , the nearest balqso . using asca and rosat observations , @xcite , determined an absorbing column of @xmath10 to @xmath11 depending on whether the absorbing material is neutral or ionized .",
    "the asca data were analyzed in @xcite who deduced that the direct observation of the nuclear x - rays was blocked by an optically thick absorber and we observe a strong reflected and scattered component through a neutral column density of @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , from chandra data @xcite find a best fit to the data if the central source is blocked by a compton thick absorber , @xmath13 and we detect scattered x - rays through multiple lines of sight through absorbing columns of @xmath14 - @xmath15 .",
    "finally , hard x - ray bepposax observations of mrk 231 combined with xmm deep observations have been made by @xcite . the high energy coverage combined with the 20 ks xmm observation",
    "provides the best determination of spectral parameters to date .",
    "they find that @xmath16 .",
    "thus , as the measurements have improved , the column density estimates have increased .",
    "we also note the deep asca observation of pg0946 + 301 in @xcite .",
    "after previous non - detections only yielded upper limits to @xmath17 , this deep observation was best fit with a thompson thick column of @xmath18 .",
    "the large column densities that have been deduced from the x - ray data are clearly only lower limits .",
    "once the absorbing column is black , small amounts of scattered x - rays or x - rays leaking through a patchy absorber ( small domains with @xmath19 to @xmath20 ) will dominate the x - ray flux and @xmath17 of the bulk of the absorbing column will be greatly underestimated . therefore , in view of the recent x - ray data it is now apparent that many balqsos are likely to have x - ray absorbing columns with compton optical depths considerably larger than one .      in order for",
    "an equatorial flow to be launched from an accretion disk , the wind must emanate at large distances from the hole , @xmath21 cm , so that the radiation source appears as a flux of photons roughly parallel to the accretion disk surface .",
    "this allows momentum transfer along the equatorial direction , driving the equatorial bal wind . as the wind is launched closer and closer to the source it looks more and more bipolar , since the photon flux attains a large vertical component ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a second necessary ingredient for the geometry is a region of x - ray shielding gas in order to insure the proper ionization state is achieved at @xmath22 cm so that lithium like atoms are available for the line driving force to work efficiently @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the large x - ray absorbing columns in balqsos has been heralded as the likely verification of the shielding gas at the inner edge of the wind and a triumph of the model @xcite . however , this is not really shielding gas , but filtering gas : it must filter out the x - rays and allow the uv emission to pass through with small attenuation . by geometric considerations ,",
    "the uv and x - ray emitting regions are well inside of the distant wind zone and the shield @xcite .",
    "thus , if the x - rays are shielded , so are the uv photons .",
    "for this reason @xcite states explicitly that for @xmath23 , `` the line force form the central engine could be so much reduced that it may not be able to accelerate the gas to high radial velocities and no strong wind will be produced . ''",
    "thus , the large column densities that have been found are problematic for equatorial models of balqso winds . however , there are disk wind models of bipolar outflows that do not suffer these same problems .",
    "bipolar outflows are ejected from the funnels of slim disks in @xcite and the work of @xcite strongly suggest that bipolar winds can be driven from a thin accretion disk at the relatively small radii .",
    "bipolar models of balqsos do not suffer the uv attenuation problem that arises from the large x - ray absorbing columns @xcite .",
    "the wind is launched by continuum radiation pressure and subsequently boosted by line driving forces farther out .",
    "thus , near its base the outflow is a hypersonic under - expanded jet that flares outward like a trumpet .",
    "thus , regions at different cylindrical radii on the surface of the disk ( i.e. , such as the x - ray region , @xmath24 , and the uv region , @xmath25 , where m is the radius of a rapidly rotating central black hole ) are exposed to different absorbing columns of wind outflow .",
    "the x - rays typically pass through @xmath26 to @xmath27 and the uv passes through @xmath20 @xcite . combining this with the observation of a polar bal outflow in circinus x-1 , it is of interest to see if any balqso can be shown to have a polar bal wind .",
    "the best possibility for success is to choose the nearest balqso in order to get adequate resolution , mrk 231 .",
    "high resolution vlbi can be used to determine a radio jet axis at 1pc and give an estimate of the spin axis of the black hole and the therefore the normal to the accretion disk .",
    "mrk 231 has been observed with vlbi by @xcite .",
    "the highest resolution measurements have been made at 15 ghz in @xcite with a resolution of about 0.9 pc .",
    "a jet like structure propagates at pa = @xmath28 in one epoch and pa = @xmath29 in another epoch",
    ". the large variability of the northeast component ( a factor of 2.5 in 1.8 years ) allows its identification as the radio core .",
    "this identification of the core is consistent with our 2-d spectroscopy .",
    "optical spectroscopy was performed on mrk 231 with the 4.2 m william herschel telescope in @xcite .",
    "the detector was an array of fiber optics and a spectrum was reduced from each of the fiber optic responses .",
    "each fiber optic captured light from a sector of the sky 0.45 \" in radius .",
    "the result is a 2-d mosaic of spectra that covers the central region of mrk 231 , 10 kpc x 13 kpc in extent .",
    "the results of the spectroscopy that are relevant are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "we are interested in features representing an outflow and the blue wing of the broad h@xmath30 line provides some clues . the upper spectrum is from the nuclear fiber optic and encompasses the region @xmath31 pc , @xmath32 km / s / mpc . the lower plot is from the adjacent fiber optic at pa = @xmath33 , @xmath34 from the nucleus . note the broad emission line feature that is superimposed on the blue wing of the h@xmath30 line .",
    "this feature exists in the nuclear fiber optic and is more pronounced in the adjacent fiber optic at pa = @xmath33 .",
    "there is no evidence of this blue bump in the spectra of any other of the fiber optics that are adjacent to the nucleus ( the spectra at all of the fiber optic positions can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusion is that this is high velocity h@xmath30 emitting gas that is flowing at pa @xmath4 .",
    "the gas is actually radiating more blue shifted photons from within @xmath31 pc , but this is swamped by the elevated background emission .",
    "one can estimate the peak velocity of the blue shifted h@xmath30 by extrapolating the background broad line wing .",
    "this is indicated by the dashed lines in figure 1 .",
    "the peaks of the emission relative to the background wing are indicated by daggers .",
    "the extrapolation of the continuum is somewhat arbitrary and we have chosen are best fit so that the two spectra have similar background blue wings . with this fit , we use the peak of h@xmath30 at @xmath35 from @xcite and the cosmological redshift of z=0.042 to find the relativistic outflow velocities associated with the blue shifted peaks of 4,729 km / s in the nucleus and 4,506 km / sec at pa = @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "note that there is some uncertainty in the estimate of the pa = @xmath33 peak due to the emergence of narrow line emission that contaminates the broad profile .",
    "we fit the background blue wings in a variety of ways that modify the velocity estimate associated with the peak of the nuclear outflow ( varies within the range of 4,500 km / sec - 5,000 km / sec depending on the background fit ) and for the pa = @xmath33 spectra ( varies from 4,300 km / sec - 4,700 km / sec , depending on the background fit ) .",
    "as mentioned above the narrow line emission at pa = @xmath33 adds some uncertainty to the estimate of the velocity of the blue bump emitting gas",
    ". it could be responsible for the slight disagreement with the nuclear blue bump velocity , since the narrow lines contribute flux to the red side of the blue bump .",
    "if one goes to the next fiber optic out along pa = @xmath33 located between 1340 pc and 2030 pc from the nucleus , the narrow line emission becomes very strong @xcite .",
    "none of the other fiber optics show this strong emission .",
    "the generation of a strong narrow line region is expected from jet propagation in the ism @xcite .",
    "in fact , a similar spectral effect has been attributed to bow shocks in the circinus galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems clear that the outflow , initially traced by the inner vlbi jet , extends @xmath36 kpc at pa @xmath4 .",
    "this direction validates the variable vlba component as the nucleus ( as opposed to pa @xmath37 ) .",
    "mrk 231 is notable for the existence of many strong low ionization broad absorption lines .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy that the primary na i d doublet , he i @xmath383889 i , ca ii k @xmath383934 and ca ii h @xmath383968 broad absorption lines occur with velocities 4,590 km / sec - 4,670 km / sec @xcite .",
    "there is h@xmath30 emitting gas in the nuclear region that also flows at 4,690 km / sec .",
    "either this is a coincidence or the two flows are one and the same .",
    "the latter seems more plausible to us and therefore , we conclude that the low ionization bal gas is flowing outward at pa @xmath4 , parallel to the projection of the jet axis on the sky plane to within @xmath39 .",
    "detailed studies of other low ionization balqso place the bal region @xmath40 200 pc -700 pc from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , since the blue bump is the most luminous in the nuclear fiber optic , the bal flow can be located anywhere within the nuclear region , @xmath41 366 pc and need not be at such large distances .",
    "in this letter , we have discussed how the large observed x - ray absorbing columns in balqsos pose an apparent catastrophic problem for the currently realistic existing equatorial bal wind models .",
    "we also point out that this is not an issue for bipolar flows .",
    "evidence is presented from circinus x-1 and mrk 231 that bipolar bal flows seem to exist .",
    "there is likely many sources of bal flows in quasars .",
    "this is particularly true for ir qsos and high redshift qso which are likely to be young objects @xcite .",
    "our analysis indicates that bipolar bal flows could be common .    motivated by our findings",
    "it has become apparent that efforts to create new numerical models that are capable of driving bipolar winds from accretion disks is essential to our understanding of balqsos .",
    "one promising model is the disk wind model of @xcite . at relatively small radii",
    ", it appears that bipolar winds can be launched . at present , it is difficult to compare the anticipated observed properties of these inner - disk driven winds with funnel driven outflows since the published model is merely an example of a broad class of models that was not optimized to produce for bipolar winds .",
    "the existing model has some apparent observable properties due to the choice of a disk from @xcite with the far uv emitting region very distant from the black hole at @xmath42 that creates a large extreme uv ( euv ) source ( @xmath43 to @xmath44 ) in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "this source over - produces the flux in the euv by 2 orders of magnitude compared to composite hst quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "there is a large scatter in the quasar spectral shapes used in these composites , so it is possible that some individual spectral energy distributions could peak deep into the euv .",
    "but , this is clearly not typical . at the present level of modeling ,",
    "it is not clear if this large euv excess is an expected characteristic of bipolar winds from the inner disk .",
    "it might be that the parameters of future models will not require such an euv excess to occur .",
    "it seems that a high priority in this field is to reproduce these simulations with a different disk model , perhaps a larger central black hole mass about a rapidly spinning black hole that will remove the euv excess and perhaps enhance the bipolar wind production from the inner disk .",
    "we would like to thank kirk korista , timothy kallman and robert antonucci for input that helped with the revision of this manuscript .",
