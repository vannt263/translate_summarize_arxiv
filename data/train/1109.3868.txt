    "now we are going to examine the structures `` graphene - sio@xmath1 - si '' , where the permittivities are smaller .",

    "6(a ) ) takes place in mid - ir spectral region , for @xmath7210.6 @xmath17 m . the applied field in this case does not exceed 2 mv / cm , but the substrate thickness should be greater because of the increase of @xmath78 .",

    "the results obtained clearly demonstrate the possibility for realization of the modulator for telecommunication spectral range ( @xmath751.5 @xmath17 m ) on the base of multilayer graphene , placed over high-@xmath0 substrate .",
    "the effective modulation can be realized in this case for the applied fields @xmath755 mv / cm , while for the case of sio@xmath1 substrate the field should be @xmath7520 mv / cm comparable to a breakdown value .",

    "the same efficiency of modulation for the mid - ir radiation ( @xmath7510.6 @xmath17 m ) can be realized for the applied fields not stronger than 2 mv / cm for the low temperature region .",
    "the consideration performed takes into account the contribution of interband transitions , described by the complex dynamic conductivity , and the radiation interference on the structure `` vacuum - graphene - substrate - doped si '' for the case of normal propagation of radiation .",
    "the modulation is determined by the pauli blocking effect under the change of the carriers concentration by the gate voltage , therefore the time of modulation is governed by the recombination time of the excess concentration of carriers , or by the time of injection from contacts .",
    "next , we discuss the assumptions used in our calculations , which are rather standart ones .",
    "the dynamic conductivity of the carriers in the spectral region under examination is described properly with the use of the linear dispersion law of carriers in graphene .",
    "the phenomenological description of the dispersion of @xmath81 due to the transitions from the valence band ( see refs . 12 and 13 ) does not change the results essentially due to the smallness of its contribution for the spectral range under consideration .",
    "the study of the declined propagation of radiation is more complicated , and the modulation efficiency in this case decreases .",
    "moreover , the modulation efficiency can also be reduced in mid - ir range due to the absorption of radiation in the doped si .",
    "it should be noted , that modulation of electron concentration in the gate gives a weak contribution to ir response and can be neglected in comparison to the pauli blocking effect in graphene .    in conclusion , the results obtained should stimulate the experimental study of the electrooptical modulation of the near - ir radiation by the structure of multilayer graphene over high-@xmath0 dielectric substrate at room temperature and high gate voltages ( concentrations ) . for the mid - ir spectral region",
