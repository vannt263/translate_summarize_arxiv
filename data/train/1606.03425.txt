    "organolead halide perovskites are attracting great interest , mainly because of their photovoltaic applications .",
    "these compounds have the general formula abx@xmath1 , where a is an organic cation , b is lead , and x is a halide ion .",
    "an example is methylammonium lead iodide ( ch@xmath1nh@xmath1pbi@xmath1 , abbreviated as mapbi@xmath1 ) , where the ma ion is coordinated to 12 i ions , while pb is octahedrally coordinated to six i ions , with every two adjacent octahedra sharing a corner .",
    "following publication of the first report @xcite on the use of these compounds as light harvesters in photovoltaic cells , many experimental studies have tried to improve upon material preparation methods and enhance their solar - to - electric power conversion efficiency .",
    "theoretical studies have also been undertaken to explore the electronic properties of these compounds and to develop accurate models for computing the energy bands .",
    "@xcite    mapbi@xmath1 has a band gap of 1.5 - 1.6 ev .",
    "@xcite the possibility of tuning the band gap by various substitutions has been considered .",
    "one approach is to replace i with br or cl , yielding mapbbr@xmath1 or mapbcl@xmath1 , with band gaps given by 2.22 ev and 3.17 ev , respectively.@xcite another approach is to replace the methylammonium cation with another cation of a different size . when ch@xmath1nh@xmath1 is replaced with fa = nh@xmath0chnh@xmath0 ( formamidinium ) , fapbi@xmath1 with a band gap of 1.43 - 1.48 ev is obtained .",
    "@xcite the lower band gap in fapbi@xmath1 , compared to the one in mapbi@xmath1 , leads to an increase in the material s optical absorption range . unfortunately , fapbi@xmath1 is unstable under ambient conditions .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that the incorporation of mapbbr@xmath1 into fapbi@xmath1 stabilizes the perovskite phase of fapbi@xmath1 and enhances the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell to 18 percent.@xcite    in addition to the extensive work demonstrating the applications of organometallic halides in solar cells , it has been shown that these materials have optoelectronic applications in light - emitting diodes.@xcite for such applications , it is desirable to have materials where the optical band gap can be tuned over a wide range of the visible spectrum .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown that , in mapbbr@xmath1 , it is easy to substitute cl for br , yielding air - stable mapbbr@xmath2cl@xmath3 with @xmath6=0 - 3 .",
    "the simple cubic lattice structure of mapbbr@xmath1 is maintained as @xmath6 increases , and the lattice constant decreases linearly with increasing @xmath6 ; the reduction is 5% at @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the band gap increases with increasing @xmath6 , leading to a tunable band gap in the 400 to 550 nm wavelength range .",
    "the crystal structure of the organometallic halides depends on the radii of the constituent ions through the goldschmidt tolerance factor @xmath8 , which , for the compound abx@xmath1 , is given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the ionic radii of the a , b , and x ions , respectively .",
    "this factor serves as a guide to predicting the crystal structure of abx@xmath1 ; for values of @xmath8 ranging from 0.9 to 1.0 , an ideal cubic perovskite structure is favored .    in calculating @xmath8 , one",
    "is faced with the problem of what value to use for the ionic radius of the organic cation a ; different values result from different methods of calculation .",
    "amat et al.@xcite obtained an ionic radius of 2.70 @xmath13 for ch@xmath1nh@xmath5 by calculating the volume inside a contour of 0.001 electrons / bohr@xmath14 density .",
    "kieslich et al.@xcite considered a hard sphere model in which the cation rotates freely about its center of mass . the ionic radius of ch@xmath1nh@xmath5 is then taken to be the distance from the cation s center of mass to nitrogen , plus 1.46   ( the ionic radius of nitrogen ) .",
    "this method yields a value of 2.17 @xmath13 for the ionic radius of the methylammonium ion .",
    "we can set some bounds on the value of the ionic radius of ch@xmath1nh@xmath5 by noting that both mapbbr@xmath1 and mapbcl@xmath1 adopt an ideal cubic perovskite structure . taking the ionic radii of pb , br , and cl to be 1.19  , 1.96  , and 1.81  , respectively",
    ", we find that for the tolerance factor @xmath8 to lie between 0.9 and 1.0 , the ionic radius of ch@xmath1nh@xmath5 should lie between 2.04 @xmath13 and 2.50  , these values should not be considered strict limits ; they are reasonable estimates .",
    "we should note that , in organolead halide compounds , the methylammonium ion does not rotate freely about its center of mass .",
    "there is disorder , manifested by the existence of 12 equivalent positions for c and n. in all these positions , the midpoint of the c - n bond is always at , or extremely close to , the center of the cubic unit cell.@xcite thus , we may estimate the ionic radius of ch@xmath1nh@xmath5 as one half the c - n bond length plus the ionic radius of nitrogen .",
    "optimizing the structure of the methylammonium cation by using the 6 - 31 g * * basis set of gaussian orbitals and the b3lyp exchange potential @xcite as implemented within gaussian 09 , @xcite the ionic radius of the cation is found to be 2.23  .",
    "the resulting goldschmidt tolerance factors are 0.952 , 0.941 , and 0.924 for mapbcl@xmath1 , mapbbr@xmath1 , and mapbi@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the fact that these compounds adopt a perovskite structure .",
    "the electronic properties of organometallic halides depend on various factors which can be controlled experimentally .",
    "these factors include lattice constants , which can be varied by applying external pressure or internal chemical pressure ; the type of halide ion , controlled by chemical substitution ; and the type of organic ion . to obtain meaningful results , it is important to use a computational model which accurately describes the known electronic properties of these compounds and which can predict the effect of these variables upon them .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) in the kohn - sham formulation @xcite is the most widely used method . here , the exchange potential is approximated by a functional of the electronic density , with the most common approximations being the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "@xcite although the ground state is well described by lda and gga , these approximations fail to account for excited - state properties . in many semiconductors",
    "the values of the band gaps are severely underestimated .",
    "improved values for the band gaps are obtained by using the gw method.@xcite the usefulness of this method , however , is hampered by its high computational cost .",
    "a different exchange potential , introduced by becke and johnson , @xcite was recently modified by tran and blaha.@xcite the modified becke - johnson ( mbj ) potential is given by @xmath15^{1/2 } \\label{eq : tbmbjpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the becke - roussel exchange potential,@xcite @xmath17 is the electron density , and @xmath18 is the kohn - sham kinetic energy density . in the above equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average of @xmath21 over the volume of the unit cell , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are parameters adjusted to produce the best fit to the experimental values of the semiconductor band gaps .",
    "we have recently shown that , upon using the modified becke - johnson exchange potential with @xmath24 and @xmath25 bohr@xmath26 , the calculated band gaps of mapbi@xmath1 , mapbbr@xmath1 , rbpbi@xmath1 , and cspbx@xmath1 ( x = cl , br ,",
    "i ) are in excellent agreement with experimental values .",
    "@xcite in this work , we show that applying this method to the lead halide compounds pbcl@xmath0 , pbbr@xmath0 , and mapbbr@xmath2cl@xmath3 for @xmath27 , and @xmath28 produces accurate values for the band gaps .",
    "we then use this method to demonstrate that a small reduction in the lattice constants of mapbbr@xmath1 and mapbi@xmath1 produces a considerable downshift in the band gaps .",
    "reduction in the lattice constants can be achieved by replacing ch@xmath1nh@xmath5 with slightly smaller cations , such as n@xmath0h@xmath4 and n@xmath0h@xmath5 .",
    "total energy calculations are carried out using the all - electron , full potential , linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method as implemented in the wien2k code.@xcite in this method , space is divided into two regions .",
    "one region consists of the interior of non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres centered at the atom sites .",
    "the rest of the space ( the interstitial ) constitutes the other region . in all the calculations reported in this work , the radii of the muffin - tin spheres are 2.1@xmath29 for pb , cl ,",
    "br , and i , where @xmath29 is the bohr radius . on the other hand , the radii for c , n , and h are chosen such that the muffin - tin spheres on adjacent atoms almost touch .",
    "the electronic wave function is expanded in terms of a set of basis functions which take different forms in the two regions mentioned above . inside the muffin - tin spheres ,",
    "the basis functions are atomic - like functions which are expanded in terms of spherical harmonics up to @xmath30 . in the interstitial region , they are plane waves with a maximum wave vector @xmath31 .",
    "each plane wave is augmented by one atomic - like function in each muffin - tin sphere .",
    "usually , @xmath31 is chosen such that @xmath32 6 - 9 , where @xmath33 is the radius of the smallest muffin - tin sphere in the unit cell . however , due to the very smallness of the muffin - tin radius of hydrogen ( @xmath34 0.65 - 0.70 @xmath29 ) , we set @xmath35 . for orthorhombic and tetragonal systems ,",
    "a 4x4x4 monkhorst - pack grid @xcite was used for sampling the brillouin zone , while an 8x8x8 grid was chosen for cubic systems .",
    "the charge density is fourier - expanded up to a maximum wave vector @xmath36 . in gga calculations , pbesol functional @xcite is used for the exchange potential .",
    "this method is well - suited for optimizing atomic positions and lattice constants . in the self - consistent calculations , the total energy and charge",
    "were converged to within 0.1 mry and 0.001 e , respectively . in calculations",
    "which employ the modified becke - johnson exchange potential , we choose @xmath37 and @xmath38 bohr@xmath26 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the parameters which appear in eq.(3 ) .",
    "we begin by carrying out dft calculations on pbcl@xmath0 , pbbr@xmath0 , and mapbbr@xmath2cl@xmath3 , for @xmath39 , and @xmath28 . at room temperature , pbcl@xmath0 and pbbr@xmath0 adopt an orthorhombic crystal structure @xcite with space group pbnm , while mapbbr@xmath2cl@xmath3 crystals have a cubic unit cell @xcite .",
    "the experimental values of the lattice constants of these crystals are given in table 1 .",
    ".crystal structure and lattice constants for some of the compounds studied in this work . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]    h@xmath40pbi@xmath1 , obtained using the mbj exchange potential and taking into account the effect of spin - orbit coupling . [ fig:2],height=245 ]    the calculated density of states in n@xmath0h@xmath40pbi@xmath1 is presented in fig .",
    "it is noted that , similar to ch@xmath1nh@xmath1pbi@xmath1 , the low - lying conduction bands are derived mainly from pb p orbitals , whereas the highest valence band is composed of both pb s and i p states .",
    "bands in the energy range -4 ev to -2 ev are derived mostly from iodine p orbitals .",
    "the character of the valence and conduction bands is also made clear in fig .",
    "3 , where the energy bands along some high - symmetry directions in the first brillouin zone are plotted .",
    "the size of the circles is proportional to the contribution of the chosen atomic orbital to the eigenstates at each * k*-point .",
    "the fact that s ( @xmath41 ) and p ( @xmath42 ) orbitals on the same atom ( pb ) make large contributions to the wave functions at the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum is responsible for the large optical absorption coefficients that occur in these compounds , and hence their usefulness in solar cell applications .        in n@xmath0h@xmath40pbi@xmath1 , the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) occur at the @xmath43-point , the brillouin zone center . in ideal cubic perovskites ,",
    "vbm and cbm occur at the zone s corner point r(1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) . here , n@xmath0h@xmath40pbi@xmath1 is assumed to have a body - centered tetragonal structure with two formula units per primitive cell .",
    "the conventional tetragonal unit cell , with four formula units , is a slight distortion of the @xmath44 supercell of the ideal cubic unit cell , and point r is zone - folded into point @xmath43 .",
    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has a profound effect on the band structure in organolead halide compounds . in fig .",
    "3 , we see that at the @xmath43 point , the lowest conduction band has energy 1.41 ev , while the next two higher bands have energy close to 3 ev .. in the absence of soc , those three bands would be almost degenerate at the @xmath43 point , and all of them would occur at about 2.5 ev . in a cubic perovskite structure , such as",
    "the one found in mapbbr@xmath1 , the conduction band minimum at point r is six - fold degenerate ( including spin degeneracy ) ; soc partially lifts the degeneracy , giving rise to a doublet ( @xmath45 ) with a lower energy and a quartet ( @xmath46 ) with a higher energy . in a body - centered tetragonal structure , cbm occurs at point @xmath43 , degeneracy is now only approximate ( it was exact in the cubic structure ) , and soc again splits the almost six - fold degenerate level into one lower doublet and two higher doublets .",
    "we have presented calculations on various lead halide compounds using density functional theory with modified becke - johnson exchange potential . for the compounds",
    "pbcl@xmath0 , pbbr@xmath0 , and ch@xmath1nh@xmath1pbbr@xmath2cl@xmath3 , for @xmath47 , and @xmath28 , we showed that the calculated band gaps are in excellent agreement with experimental values .",
    "we then used this computational method to predict the electronic structure of similar compounds , namely , those that result from the replacement of the methylammonium cation in mapbbr@xmath1 and mapbi@xmath1 with the slightly smaller cations n@xmath0h@xmath4 and n@xmath0h@xmath5 .",
    "a significant downshift in the band gap values is predicted to occur as a result of these replacements . in particular",
    ", we predict that n@xmath0h@xmath40pbi@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1pbi@xmath1 have band gaps given by 1.41 ev and 1.13 ev , respectively . therefore .",
    "these compounds , if synthesized , would be excellent light harvesters in solar cells",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the instability of the diazenium cation ( n@xmath0h@xmath5 ) may make it difficult to use it as a replacement for the methyl ammonium cation .",
