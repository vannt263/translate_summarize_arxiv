    "computational simulations have opened a new avenue for the exploration and prediction of ``  la carte '' molecular complexes and materials , i.e. , with tailored properties and functionality , due to the development of powerful algorithms and an increase in computational power .",
    "generally , an increase in complexity or system size goes hand - in - hand with a loss of accuracy or an increase in numerical cost .",
    "highly accurate wave function methods , which have recently become available also for solids @xcite , are limited in the complexity of systems they can handle .",
    "this hinders the application of these methods to complex molecular structures , e.g.  nanostructures and biomolecules .",
    "however , now , more than ever , there is a need for methods that are able to handle large - scale systems with high precision in order to assess the challenges in material , bio- , and nanosciences .",
    "density functional theory ( dft)@xcite , on the other hand , comes with a low computational cost , which allows its application to rather large systems .",
    "the lack of a systematic way to improve functionals is hampering the progress towards a more accurate and efficient dft first - principles scheme .",
    "currently , several properties are still difficult to predict within standard dft , with the band gap and molecular dissociation being prominent examples .",
    "the latter is described correctly with a standard local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation functional only if the spin symmetry is artificially broken .",
    "the recently introduced strictly correlated functional@xcite rectifies this problem , however , at the expense of a wrong description of the equilibrium properties .",
    "although the exact exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional of dft is universal , one could of course use different approximations depending on the physical situation or quantity of interest . to this end ,",
    "large databases collecting information from different functionals are compiled@xcite .",
    "the lack of a proper description of static correlation is at the heart of many of the failures of present xc approximations of dft for describing strongly correlated systems and molecular bond breaking and formation .",
    "this deficiency can be traced back to the fact that within kohn - sham ( ks ) dft the density is reproduced via a single slater determinant . when the true wave function has multireference character the ks kinetic energy is a poor approximation to the true kinetic energy .",
    "the difference has to be compensated by the xc energy which for many approximations is not done very successfully , leading to a wrong total energy in the case of molecular dissociation .    in electronic structure theory ,",
    "a desirable feature of independent particle models , like the ks scheme in dft , is the direct prediction of single - electron properties , like ionization potentials ( ips ) , from the eigenvalues of the single - particle hamiltonians .",
    "although the question about the physical content of the ks orbital energies raised a scientific debate  @xcite , theoretical justification for this result was given by baerends and co - workers  @xcite and by bartlett and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , orbital energies from approximate functionals tend to underestimate substantially the ips of molecular systems  @xcite .",
    "reduced - density - matrix - functional theory ( rdmft ) @xcite is an alternative to dft to approximate the many - electron problem .",
    "it is based on approximating the total energy of an electronic system in terms of the one - body reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) .",
    "a main difference from dft is the introduction of fractional occupation numbers which allows the exact treatment of the kinetic energy and potentially leads to improved accuracy whenever the ground - state many - body wave function is far from a single slater determinant .",
    "most approximations in rdmft are explicit functionals of  and are minimized in terms of  the natural orbitals ( nos ) , @xmath0 , and their occupation numbers , @xmath1 .",
    "so far , various different approximations for the total energy functional have become available@xcite which have proven to describe correctly such diverse properties as molecular dissociation@xcite or band gaps@xcite .",
    "however , applications have been restricted to small molecules due to the computational cost to determine the orbitals .",
    "although the optimization of the occupation numbers is a relatively inexpensive task , orbital minimization is complicated : it does not reduce to an iterative eigenvalue problem ( as in dft ) and requires numerically expensive procedures .",
    "significant effort has been devoted to devising effective hamiltonians@xcite to improve the efficiency , but with limited success so far .    if we were able to incorporate all the advantages of rdmft functionals into dft while keeping the cost of standard dft functionals we would make a big step forward in constructing an efficient and accurate scheme able to cope with the challenge of describing structural and dynamical properties of many - electron systems including bond breaking and bond formation . in this paper , we propose such a framework that combines the best of both dft and rdmft .",
    "one can regard this approach as either an extension of dft , where fractional occupations for the orbitals are introduced using an approximation for the xc energy functional borrowed from rdmft , or , alternatively , as a constrained rdmft calculation . in either case",
    ", we incorporate the proper nonidempotent nature of the density matrix in the calculation of the kinetic energy that is fundamental to the success of rdmft approximations .    the central idea in our proposed framework , which we call _ local rdmft _",
    ", is to restrict the minimization with respect to the nos to a domain where these orbitals are eigenfunctions of a single - particle hamiltonian with a local potential .",
    "the best possible hamiltonian is the one whose eigenorbitals minimize the total energy .",
    "the resulting equations are similar to the optimized effective potential ( oep ) equations@xcite .",
    "the oep improves the accuracy in dft and significant expertise has been developed in the past two decades@xcite for its efficient implementation .",
    "hence , our method can be implemented directly in existing dft codes with only small modifications to address fractional occupation numbers .",
    "fractional occupations , as in standard rdmft , are provided by the minimization of the energy functional under the appropriate conditions .",
    "our approach has some similarity with the idea explored by grning et al .",
    "@xcite , where the common energy denominator approximation is used together with the mller functional . in that approach ,",
    "occupancies are obtained in an empirical way and not through optimization .",
    "the local rdmft framework provides an energy eigenvalue spectrum connected to the nos and as we show , single electron properties , like the ips of small molecules , are well reproduced by the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homos ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we describe in detail the formalism of local rdmft . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : applications ] , we show that the restriction to a local effective potential has little effect on the dissociation of dimers ; hence , the accuracy of rdmft is retained by the proposed method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : applications ] we also illustrate the quality of the energy spectrum provided by the effective hamiltonian by comparing the obtained ips with experiment . in the appendix we show that pure density xc functionals are not adequate for the present scheme since they can not lead to fractional occupations in a minimization procedure and we need to employ functionals of the 1rdm as we do in the present work .",
    "clearly , the integration of dft with rdmft is desirable as it could combine the best of both worlds . with fractional occupation numbers ,",
    "static correlation would become accessible , while use of a common local potential to yield the nos would improve dramatically the efficiency of the method . however , this target is not straightforward .",
    "a natural way to incorporate a local potential for the orbitals , is to consider the approximate rdmft xc energy to be a density functional , so that its functional derivative would give the local potential .",
    "unfortunately , such an approach leads in general to an idempotent density matrix ( see appendix ) and we are back to square one .",
    "hence , we abandon the requirement that the xc energy must be a functional of the density and that the potential must arise as a functional derivative with respect to the density . instead , we consider the total energy as a functional of the one - body - reduced - density matrix ( 1rdm ) , @xmath2 , @xmath3 = t [ \\gamma ( { \\bf r } , { \\bf r } ' ) ] + \\int d^3 r \\ ,",

    "fractional occupations , @xmath1 , as in standard rdmft , are provided by the minimization of the energy functional of eq .",
    "( [ eq : functional ] ) under the appropriate @xmath14-representability conditions .",
    "the natural orbitals in the exact theory , as well as the minimizing orbitals in rdmft approximations , are typically satisfying a schrdinger equation with a nonlocal effective potential .",

    "( [ eq : locham ] ) , the total energy becomes a functional of the local effective potential and of the occupation numbers , @xmath15 $ ] . in the same way as in the oep method @xcite ,",

    "( [ eq : functional ] ) . in the summations of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) , we have excluded terms over pairs of orbitals differing in occupation by less than a cutoff value @xmath24 .",
    "this choice excludes pairs of weakly occupied orbitals whose energies @xmath25",
    "are not accurate for finite localized basis sets ; e.g. , occasionally they violate the aufbau principle and the negative definiteness of @xmath26 . by excluding these terms , we also partly alleviate a common inaccuracy of most rdmft functionals to show a spurious excess of total occupation in weakly occupied orbitals @xcite . in that way",
    ", we have examined the dependence of our solution on @xmath24 .",
    "typically , for very small values of @xmath24 we run into convergence issues and ips vary substantially as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath24 increases to a typical value of 0.1 convergence improves dramatically and ips remain unchanged as a function of @xmath24 for a broad range of values . even for values of @xmath24 larger than the homo - lowest occupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) occupation difference",
    ", we do not find any noticeable change in the results .",
    "further increase deteriorates the accuracy since fewer terms are included in the summations .",
    "a choice for @xmath27 usually leads to a converged solution .",
    "accidental exclusions of strongly - weakly occupied pairs have a negligible effect on the results .",
    "to ensure a physical asymptotic decay of the effective repulsive potential , we do not solve eq .",
    "( [ oep_0 ] ) directly .",
    "instead , we follow the methodology in ref .",
    "@xcite and express @xmath28 as the electrostatic potential of an effective repulsive density , @xmath29 : @xmath30 the requirement  @xcite that the effective repulsive density corresponds to a ( fictitious ) system of @xmath13 electrons repelling the electron at @xmath31 yields the following two constraints : @xmath32 the first condition is necessary for the asymptotic decay of the effective repulsive potential as @xmath33 , which is a property of the exact hxc potential@xcite .",
    "the two conditions together become sufficient ( although probably not necessary anymore ) to guarantee the correct asymptotic behavior and a well - posed mathematical problem .",
    "minimization of the total energy leads to an integral equation for the effective repulsive density : @xmath34 with @xmath35 the two constraints can be incorporated with a lagrange multiplier ( [ eq : asympt ] ) and a penalty term ( [ eq : pos ] ) that introduces an energy cost for every point where @xmath36 becomes negative .",
    "we expand the anos in a basis set ( orbital basis ) and the effective repulsive density ( rather than the potential ) in another ( auxiliary ) basis and we obtain , similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite , a linear system of equations for the expansion coefficients of the repulsive density .",
    "the inversion of the linear equations is complicated by the fact that the matrix of the response function @xmath37 becomes singular when the auxiliary basis is large compared to the orbital basis@xcite . as a result",
    ", the effective repulsive density becomes indeterminate in the null space of the ( finite - orbital - basis ) response function .",
    "this indeterminacy is substantially suppressed by the two constraints , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : asympt ] ) and ( [ eq : pos ] ) , that reduce drastically the form of the admissible effective repulsive densities and effective repulsive potentials .",
    "we have found that with a singular value decomposition , we obtain systematically smooth and physical densities and potentials ( see ref .  ) .",
    "a consequence of the local - potential approximation is that the asymptotic decay of the anos depends on the energy eigenvalue @xmath25 and hence , differs from the ( necessarily uniform ) asymptotic decay of exact nos with fractional occupancy@xcite . as a result",
    ", the asymptotic exponential decay of the density is related to the highest energy eigenvalue with nonzero occupation and not to the ip .",
    "the effect in the total energy from the different asymptotics - compared with the behavior of the exact nos - is negligible since the energy contribution of the asymptotic region is insignificant .",
    "similarly to standard rdmft , nominal scaling of local rdmft is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total number of different generalized fock matrices [ defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : liapis ] ) ] that need to be evaluated and then transformed to obtain the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b ] ) . for most approximations",
    "equal occupations result in equal generalized fock matrices . hence , @xmath39 is typically equal to the number of orbitals with fractional occupations plus an additional one common for all the fully occupied orbitals .",
    "since @xmath39 can be fixed , the nominal scaling of local rdmft reduces to that of hartree - fock ( hf ) or hybrid dft calculations .",
    "the number of different @xmath40 that need to be evaluated , and the additional cycle of convergence of the occupations apart from the anos add to the overall computational cost of local - rdmft as compared to standard dft and hartree - fock calculations .",
    "the present scheme would benefit from the recent developments in reducing the scaling of wave - function - based schemes  @xcite .",
    "significant numerical cost saving is also expected by improving the enforcement of the positivity condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pos ] ) . however , the search for the optimal repulsive density through an iterative eigenvalue equation is still much more efficient than full minimization for the whole set of natural orbitals .",
    "this computational efficiency represents a big advantage of local rdmft over standard rdmft allowing for the first time relatively large systems to be in the capability of rdmft .",
    "the application of local rdmft to larger systems gives very promising results@xcite .",
    "finally , one advantage of this method is that it can be easily implemented in standard electronic structure codes due to its similarity with the oep method .",
    "finally , with regard to the efficiency of our scheme , our target is not to replace well - established methods in routine calculations where these methods are known to be accurate but to complement them and improve over their results where they deviate from experiment .",
    "such cases are for instance bond breaking and highly correlated systems where static correlations are important . at the same time , in our scheme , the orbital energies from the effective hamiltonian offer improved spectral properties .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : allpots ] , we show the effective local potential for a ne atom employing two rdmft approximations , the mller@xcite and bbc3@xcite functionals . as we see , the optimal potentials are similar to the exact - exchange oep ( x - oep ) , especially for bbc3 while local mller is closer to the exact ks@xcite potential .",
    "the comparison with the local potentials of different theories and the exact ks scheme are useful since a reasonable approximate potential resembling the exact ks potential will hopefully lead to a reasonable single - particle spectrum .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we now focus on the single - electron spectrum of the local potential hamiltonian . for this purpose , we obtained ips as the corresponding eigenvalues of the local potential hamiltonian for a test set of atomic and molecular systems and basis sets .",
    "this set comprises small atomic and molecular systems using the cc - pvtz and uncontracted cc - pvtz basis sets for the orbital and the auxiliary basis respectively , and we obtained ips up to the third one . our numerical results for several rdmft functionals are shown in table  [ tab : ips ] where on the bottom we also show the average , absolute , percentage error of ips . the same errors for the ips obtained as the energy eigenvalues of hartree - fock ( koopmans theorem ) are also included for comparison .",
    "we find a remarkable agreement between the energy eigenvalues and the experimental ips for the functionals we tested .",
    "all errors are below or around 5% , with the marques - lathiotakis ( ml ) functional@xcite going as low as @xmath413% .",
    "the agreement with experiment is even better for the first ips with the mller functional being the most accurate with an error of only @xmath412% .",
    "overall the agreement with experimental values is very good and substantially better than the hf koopmans theorem .    to estimate the effect of the local potential approximation we include in table  [ tab : ips ] the ratio @xmath42 of the correlation energies ( defined as the energy differences from hartree - fock ) with local rdmft over those provided by the full rdmft minimization .",
    "the average @xmath42 over the whole set of systems , included in the last row of table  [ tab : ips ] , is in the range 0.6 - 0.8% for all functionals considered .",
    "however , as in dft calculations , the comparison of the obtained correlation energy to the exact one is not the only decisive factor to assess the accuracy of an approximation in reproducing many properties . for the mller functional , the local rdmft recovers on average 71% of the full minimization correlation energy .",
    "the mller functional generally overestimates the correlation energy substantially in the full minimization and the constraint of the local potential offers an improvement . for more accurate functionals ,",
    "however , this is not always the case .",
    "in conclusion , we presented a method on how to incorporate static correlation into ks - like equations by employing xc functionals from rdmft .",
    "we have shown that when the xc energy is a density functional then the total energy minimization leads to an idempotent solution ( appendix ) .",
    "consequently , we relaxed the requirement that the potential must be the functional derivative of the energy with respect to the density and decided to minimize the total energy with respect to the occupation numbers and the anos generated by a local effective potential . in this way , we manage to describe the dissociation of diatomic molecules accurately .",
    "in addition , our approach allows us to connect a single - particle energy spectrum to the anos .",
    "this spectrum is in good agreement with experimental ips and photoelectron spectra for molecules .",
    "the proposed method provides a powerful tool which opens a new avenue : physically motivated approximations in density - matrix based schemes , able to cope with strongly correlated systems@xcite and static correlation , can now be brought to the realm of dft .",
    "the resulting ks - like approach is able to simultaneously describe ground - state properties , bond breaking , and single - electron spectral properties .",
    "the scaling of our method can be easily reduced to that of hybrid dft methods using standard techniques .",
    "the improved computational efficiency compared to full rdmft minimization allows for the application to large systems opening the road for an improved description of electronic correlations in technologically important molecular systems .",
