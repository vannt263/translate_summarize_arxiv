    "the study of nuclear effects in structure functions are necessary to understand the microscopic structure of nucleons and nuclei in terms of quantum chromodynamics @xcite . however , when studying the nucleon structure functions , the main difficulties are related to the neutron structure function @xmath4 , because neutrons can not be prepared as scattering targets . consequently , @xmath4 has to be extracted from the measurable deuteron structure function @xmath5 , plus the knowledge of the proton one @xmath6 . in doing",
    "this analysis one is always facing the problem of quantifying the nuclear structure effects in the deuteron .",
    "a priori it appears as a reasonable approximation to consider the deuteron as a free proton plus a free neutron system , because the binding energy is small ( @xmath7 mev ) . nevertheless , deuteron is not strictly a superposition of free constituents and for this reason the smearing produced by nuclear binding effects have been the subject of several analysis based on different physical considerations @xcite .",
    "these studies ended with a large variety of values for the neutron structure function , all coming from the same experimental data .",
    "in addition to limiting our ability to extract the neutron structure function , the large spread of results even among extractions including only traditional nuclear effects such as fermi motion and binding has made it difficult to identify a reliable baseline which could be used to search for more involved nuclear effects such as the so called emc effect @xcite .",
    "the new measurements on light nuclei @xcite have generated a renewed interest in the emc effect even in the polarized case @xcite .",
    "emc ratios are usually taken with respect to the deuteron , but the deuteron may also exhibit an emc effect .",
    "several attempts @xcite have been made to determine @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the free neutron(proton ) structure functions .",
    "a good experimental determination of @xmath10 can shed some light on the cause of this effect .",
    "the high quality data of bonus @xcite designed to measure @xmath11 at high @xmath12 allows a better determination of @xmath10 @xcite . on the other hand new parametrizations of the nucleon structure functions have appeared @xcite which allow the study of observables with higher precision and up to higher @xmath0",
    "this wealth of data has prompted us to review a description presented some time ago @xcite aimed at making compatible the gottfried sum rule with the data by considering nuclear effects in the deuteron .",
    "this should allow to identify a reliable baseline which could be used to search for nuclear effects such as the modification of the nucleon structure function in nuclei or non - nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "in the next section we recall the previously mentioned analysis . in section 3",
    "we show the results obtained under this scheme but using all the presently available data and we make a comparison with recent related proposals .",
    "we finish by drawing some conclusions .",
    "when the nmc collaboration @xcite presented in 1991 the analysis of the ratio of the structure functions @xmath13 obtained in deep inelastic scattering of muons on hydrogen and deuterium targets , exposed simultaneously to the beam , assumed that nuclear effects were not significant in deuterium , namely @xmath14 and consequently @xmath15 the formula ( [ formula2 ] ) was used in ref.@xcite to extract the @xmath16 ratios from the experimental data on @xmath17 .",
    "that data set was also used in order to test the validity of the gottfried sum rule @xcite @xmath18 = \\frac{1}{3}\\ ] ] and found a value significantly below this quark - parton model prediction of @xmath19 .    assuming the convergence of the gottfried sum rule for the extraction of @xmath20 from the data on deuterium @xcite , it was shown , that even though the corrections to the naive expression ( [ formula1 ] ) could be small , their effect is highly amplified in this difference .",
    "it was concluded that significant tests of the gottfried sum rule can not be made on the basis of the deuteron data without considering nuclear effects @xcite .",
    "these measurable nuclear effects in deuterium were in agreement with predictions of several models such as the light cone approach to the deuteron structure function @xcite , parton recombination model @xcite and pionic effects in the deuteron @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the picture that emerged when comparing nuclear structure functions with those of free protons was different from the standard comparison with deuterium protons @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the nuclear effects in deuterium were taken into account by defining the bound nuclear structure function , @xmath5 , by means of @xmath21 due to isospin symmetry , the @xmath22 factor was taken the same for the proton and neutron structure functions .",
    "then , the difference between the bound nucleon structure functions was expressed as @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ratio @xmath24 is related to experiments by @xmath25 unfortunately , data coming from deuteron targets are always used in the fits although the inclusion of @xmath22 does not alter the conclusions .",
    "this equation leads to @xmath26 from which the parameter @xmath22 can be adjusted by using the experimental data on the deuteron combined with a parametrisation of the quark distributions .",
    "calculated using nmc @xcite data and morfin and tung @xcite ( filled circles ) and mstw @xcite ( filled squares ) distributions .",
    "the lines are shown to guide the eye . ]    in fig.[fig1 ] we show the original calculation of the parameter @xmath27 as a function of bjorken @xmath12 from ref.@xcite using eq.([betacalc ] ) and one using a new parametrisation of the structure functions .",
    "we use eq.([formula2 ] ) with the experimental data on the ratio @xmath28 from ref.@xcite and the absolute deuteron structure function from a fit to published data from other experiments . for quark distributions",
    "we show two parametrizations : the morfin and tung parametrization ( @xmath29-fit in the dis scheme ) @xcite , shown with filled circles and the more recent mstw parametrization @xcite shown with filled black squares .",
    "the lines are to guide the eye .",
    "@xcite for a clear explanation on the downturn of the low @xmath0 data associated to target mass corrections .",
    "some features of nuclear effects are apparent in fig .",
    "the antishadowing maximum appears clearly in both parametrizations around @xmath30 persisting for low x with morfin and tung @xcite , but not so with mstw @xcite , where it disappears for @xmath31 .",
    "as it was mentioned , a remarkable feature of the gottfried sum rule is that it is an amplifier of nuclear effects .",
    "a small amount of antishadowing causes a big deviation in the integrand .",
    "this explains why @xmath22 is quite independent of the parton distribution used and why the deuteron nuclear effects could be safely neglected in many analysis .",
    "the above results show that structure function ratios with respect to deuterium is not a precise procedure to extract nuclear effects since the composite nature of deuterium at the nuclear level has to enter into the theoretical description for those effects .",
    "it is therefore relevant to see how the new data complete this picture .",
    "the study of nuclear effects in the deuteron has been a subject which has gained great interest in the last years .",
    "other schemes have completed the description above and we proceed to discuss them next and to compare them with our scheme using the latest available data .    in ref.@xcite nuclear corrections were defined in terms of a function @xmath32 by means of @xmath33/2\\ ] ] from this definition it is clear that this correction @xmath32 is , in principle , essentially equal to our @xmath27 factor . in ref.@xcite the following parametrisation of @xmath32 was presented @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a pivot point at which the normalization is @xmath36 .",
    "the values of the parameters for the deuteron correction factor are given in table 1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite the structure function ratio @xmath37 was computed and can easily be connected with our @xmath22 , @xmath38 the deuteron structure function @xmath5 defined in eq.([formula1 ] ) is a structure function per nucleon and it is connected with the @xmath39 used in ref.@xcite by @xmath40 these authors have used the recently published data on @xmath41 taken by the bonus experiment using clas at jefferson lab @xcite . for @xmath42",
    "they used the available global parametrisations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite they describe the so called imc ( in - medium correction ) effect in terms of the slope of the emc effect arriving to the conclusion that @xmath43 their main result in this respect is their fig.2 .    in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we show the ratios @xmath16 obtained from the experimental ratios @xmath17 of ref.@xcite using eq.([formula2 ] ) .",
    "we also show the older nmc data given in ref.@xcite used in the previous estimation of @xmath22 . in this figure we also present ( a ) the ratio @xmath16 extracted in ref.@xcite that makes use of data available from different experiments and ( b ) the ratio using the data of weinstein et al . @xcite .",
    "the figure shows the consistency between all the modern data and makes apparent that the old data , available only in the region @xmath44 , give a value for the ratio smaller that that from the modern data .",
    "we begin by presenting the results in our @xmath22 scheme using the newest available data to proceed thereafter to compare with all the other schemes .",
    "we show in fig.[fig3 ] the experimental ratios @xmath17 obtained by the new muon collaboration ( nmc ) in 1997 and presented in ref.@xcite . to study the importance of the @xmath0 dependence we show the data separately for each value of @xmath0 .    from the data in fig",
    "[ fig3 ] we extract @xmath27 using eq.[betacalc ] using the new mstw parametrization of the structure functions @xcite .",
    "we adjust these data to a functional fit of the type used in ref .",
    "@xcite shown in eq .",
    "( [ martin ] ) .",
    "we perform four types of fits : for low @xmath45 gev@xmath46 , intermediate @xmath0 ( 14 , 19 , 26 gev@xmath46 , high @xmath47 gev@xmath46 and all @xmath0 .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] summarizes the different nuclear corrections proposed including our new results for @xmath27 .",
    "the values of @xmath27 corresponding to the low @xmath0 are shown with black filled circles , the high @xmath0 values are presented by grey circles and the intermediate @xmath0 values are given by the open triangles .",
    "the results of the fit are given by the thick continuous lines : the solid line represents the fit for entire range of @xmath0 , the dashed line  the fit for low @xmath0 , the dotted line  the high @xmath0 and the dash - dotted line stands for the fit for the intermediate region of @xmath0 .",
    "the thin long dashed line is the nuclear correction calculated by accardi et al in refs.@xcite for the @xmath0 = 10 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the corrections @xmath32 calculated for the three sets of parameters given in ref.@xcite are presented with continuous lines ( solid , dashed and dot - dashed for three different parameter sets ) .",
    "the values of @xmath48 obtained in ref.@xcite are shown with stars and contain error bars .",
    "our fit for all data is in relatively good agreement with all other results .",
    "however , our study of the @xmath0 dependence indicates that for low @xmath0 nuclear effects are inexistent , for intermediate @xmath0 they appear , if at all , at higher @xmath12 and for high @xmath0 they are very important .",
    "we have studied nuclear effects below the fermi motion dominated region ( @xmath49 ) on the deuteron using the newest available data by revisiting a scheme proposed initially when the first nmc data appeared @xcite .",
    "we have compared our @xmath22 scheme with all other analysis appeared recently in the literature and have shown that they agree in general terms .",
    "the structure of the deuteron is non trivial and manifests itself quite dramatically in dis .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 dependence of its structure effects finding that for low @xmath0 they are irrelevant in all the studied region , for intermediate @xmath0 they are irrelevant for most of the studied region ( @xmath50 ) and above better data are required to find the precise behavior although one would not expect more than 1% effect . for high @xmath0",
    "the effect is considerable .",
    "thus our conclusion is that one can not neglect the nuclear structure of the deuteron when performing emc ratios at high @xmath0 ( @xmath51 gev@xmath46 .",
    "the deuteron structure modifies the ratios specially around the antishadowing region and this might impede , if not taken into account , a correct physical interpretation .",
    "thus the nature of the deuteron has to enter the description of the data from any qcd based analysis .",
