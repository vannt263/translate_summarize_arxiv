    "this indicates that the baryon transport description in hijing/@xmath9 underpredicts stopping in central au+au collisions and is not sufficient to describe the data .            to quantify the stopping we use the average rapidity loss defined as @xcite : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the number of net - baryons and @xmath12 for @xmath6 gev .",

    "<S> the rapidity dependence of the net - proton yields from peripheral au+au collisions is found to have a similar behaviour to that found for the p+p results , while a quite different rapidity dependence is found for central au+au collisions . </S>",
