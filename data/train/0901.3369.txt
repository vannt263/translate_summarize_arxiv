    "the accurate and efficient estimation of free energy differences is an important goal in chemical physics and remains an active area of research .",
    "one promising approach to free energy estimation entails measuring the work done on a system over repetitions of an irreversible process . according to the second law of thermodynamics , the mean work is greater than the free energy difference between the end states of the process , @xmath0 .",
    "nonequilibrium work theorems @xcite supplement this upper bound by rigorously equating @xmath0 with other averaged functions of the work .",
    "these theorems have been empirically validated in single - molecule pulling experiments @xcite and computer simulations ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "jarzynski s equality , @xcite a unidirectional nonequilibrium work theorem , relates the free energy difference to an exponential average of the work . unfortunately , because it uses a nonlinear ( specifically , a logarithmic ) function of the average , the free energy estimator based on this equality suffers from a systematic finite - sampling bias . @xcite while accurate in the limit of infinite sampling , this estimator is usually dominated by rare events where the work is less than the free energy difference , and thereby converges slowly .",
    "@xcite    if the average amount of work dissipated as heat is reduced , these low - work events will be more frequent and accurate free energy estimation will usually require fewer work samples . the most straightforward way to reduce",
    "heat dissipation is to slow the rate of the process ; in the limit of infinitely slow switching , the process is reversible and the work is equal to the free energy difference .",
    "unfortunately , reducing the switching rate requires additional time and lowers the signal - to - noise ratio in single - molecule pulling experiments .",
    "@xcite under the constraint of constant experiment length , it is possible to reduce heat dissipation by optimizing the switching protocol that controls how the thermodynamic state changes with time .",
    "protocol variation predates jarzynski s equality , having been applied to tightening free energy bounds from the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "@xcite more recently , variational calculus has been applied to find optimal protocols that minimize the mean work .",
    "@xcite    while protocol variation is , in principle , feasible in laboratory experiments , many more approaches to improving nonequilibrium - based free energy estimation are possible in computer simulations .",
    "for example , wu and kofke were inspired by the rosenbluth chain sampling scheme to develop methods for generating low - work nonequilibrium paths .",
    "@xcite vaikuntanathan and jarzynski took another approach , altering the system dynamics , to reduce heat dissipation and improve free energy estimates .",
    "@xcite the approach most mathematically similar to this work , however , is importance sampling in nonequilibrium path space .",
    "@xcite    in importance sampling , samples from one distribution are used to estimate expectations in another .",
    "the technique is often applied to markov chain monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations ( where it is usually called umbrella sampling ) : after applying a configurational bias to overcome energy barriers and promote ergodicity , expectations are calculated for the unbiased ensemble .",
    "importance sampling has been extended to transition path sampling @xcite with nonequilibrium trajectories . in this algorithm",
    ", a biasing function modifies the monte carlo acceptance criteria of proposed paths in a way that improves the convergence of free energy estimates .",
    "@xcite    here , we apply the importance sampling formalism in a completely different way .",
    "instead of sampling nonequilibrium trajectories in a biased manner , we focus on the analysis of previously generated paths .",
    "instead of asking which path - ensemble we would like to sample from , we ask which path - ensemble average we would like to evaluate .",
    "this is accomplished by processing paths generated using one protocol - the _ sampling _ protocol , @xmath1 - using another - the _ analysis _ protocol , @xmath2 .",
    "while we have infinite freedom in selecting an analysis protocol , not all choices will improve the convergence of free energy estimates .",
    "one reasonable strategy for choosing @xmath2 is to minimize the lag , the difference between the nonequilibrium and instantaneous equilibrium densities ; vaikuntanathan and jarzynski found that under certain dynamics , dissipation is eliminated if there is no lag , leading to a zero - variance estimator of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite to reduce the lag , they modified their equation of motion with an additional flow - field term that  escorts \" the system along a near - equilibrium path .",
    "essentially , this strategy modifies the nonequilibrium density . in this paper , we take the opposite approach : using the analysis protocol to choose an instantaneous equilibrium density that closely matches the sampled nonequilibrium density .",
    "as an illustrative case , consider a brownian particle in a harmonic oscillator , or spring , which moves at a constant velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : movingho_lag ] ) .",
    "if the system starts in thermal equilibrium , its density is a gaussian about the initial spring position .",
    "when the spring starts moving , the density remains a gaussian with the same variance , but its mean position , @xmath3 , lags behind the spring position .",
    "@xcite for this particular system , an analysis protocol based on @xmath3 will have _ no _ lag .",
    "we shall further explore this system in section [ sec : analytical ] .",
    "lag in a moving harmonic oscillator : potential energy ( solid line ) , @xmath4 , and density ( dashed line ) , @xmath5 , as a function of position , at ( a ) @xmath6 and ( b ) @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",

    "for all parts of this figure , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ]    one complication with using an analysis protocol that minimizes the lag is that its end state is usually not the same as in the sampling protocol .",
