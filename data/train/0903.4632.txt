    "kicked rotor models  @xcite have played a prominent role in the study of classically chaotic systems and their corresponding quantum behavior .",
    "although quite simple , these models exhibit most of the distinctive features of classical and quantum chaos .",
    "the particular phenomenon that is the subject of this paper is _ quantum localization _ , which is a localization in angular momentum space that is in sharp contrast to the diffusive motion typical of classical chaos .",
    "the understanding of quantum localization is considerably facilitiated by the existence of a mapping from the rotor model to a model of a particle moving in a disordered lattice  @xcite , which exhibits the phenomenon of anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "single rotor systems have been thoroughly studied and are well understood  @xcite . however , the situation is less clear for systems of two coupled kicked rotors . indeed , there are examples in the literature whose results appear to be contradictory .",
    "doron and fishman  @xcite have studied one such model , and they found quantum localization of the anderson type , scaling exponentially with the coupling strength . on the other hand , adachi _",
    "et   al . _",
    "@xcite have studied a model with different coupling potentials , and have obtained results that exhibit diffusive growth in the width of the state .",
    "they concluded that the coupling between the two rotors can restore the mixing @xcite that would otherwise be suppressed by quantum localization .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this apparent contradiction .",
    "the two papers are based on models that differ in the form of the kicking and coupling potentials .",
    "although it is logically possible for the two models to behave qualitatively differently , this would be very surprizing , since the forms of the potentials are similar enough that we should expect them to belong to the same generic class .",
    "the ranges of interaction parameter strength used in the two papers are quite different .",
    "indeed , the lattice emerging from the choice of parameters in  @xcite turns out to be periodic , which would give rise to extended bloch states .",
    "so we need to study the two models in equivalent ranges of paramenters .",
    "the two papers also used different criteria for identifying localization .",
    "doron and fishman  @xcite look for an exponential fall - off in the angular momentum distribution , while adachi _",
    "et   al . _",
    "@xcite look for a saturation in time of the width ( standard deviation ) of the distribution .",
    "so we need to apply both criteria to both models to determine whether they agree .",
    "a further complication arises because two - dimensional disordered lattices contain the marginal case of weakly localized states , which creates more interesting possibilities .    in this paper",
    "we investigate these questions .",
    "to do so , we consider a more general hamiltonian that includes the models of  @xcite and  @xcite as special cases .",
    "we study the system numerically for a suitable range of parameters , and examine the shape and fall - off of the angular momentum distribution , together with its standard deviation as a measure of the state width .",
    "in section ii we discuss the hamiltonian , the initial state , and the method of numerical calculation . in section iii the classical behavior of the system is studied , and is shown to lie within the chaotic region of phase space for the chosen range of parameters .",
    "section iv presents the numerical results for the quantum system . in section",
    "v we examine whether the results are consistent with the scaling properties of weak localization .",
    "section vi discusses the conclusions .",
    "the general hamiltonian is chosen to be @xmath0 @xmath1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dimensionless parameters are related to the physical quantities as follows : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the time span between kicks , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the moments of inertia of the first and second rotors , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the single - rotor kicking strengths , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the couplings between the two rotors",
    ".    the choice @xmath10 and @xmath11 will yield the hamiltonian studied in  @xcite .",
    "the main systems analyzed in  @xcite correspond to @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "since these values of @xmath15 are commensurate with @xmath16 , they yield periodic lattices , giving rise to extended bloch - like states and excluding the possibility of anderson localization . therefore , we have used a different value in our numerical studies .",
    "the quantum system is obtained by replacing the momentum variables with operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the time evolution for one period of the kicking hamiltonian",
    "is given by the floquet operator @xmath19 the numerical calculation is performed in two stages .",
    "starting in the momentum representation , the propagator @xmath20 , which is diagonal in this basis , is applied for the duration between two kicks .",
    "then the kicking propagator @xmath21 is applied in the angle representation .",
    "the transformation between the angle and angular momentum representations is achieved by fast fourier transform ( fft ) and its inverse .",
    "the same process is then repeated for the next period , and so on .",
    "the initial state is chosen to have the form @xmath22^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is a product of gaussian wave packets , centered at momentum @xmath23 and angle @xmath24 , with momentum width @xmath25 .",
    "hence we have @xmath26 .",
    "a summary of the parameter values are given in table [ tablez ] .",
    ".parameters of the initial state [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now wish to test the scaling theory by comparison with the results of numerical simulation . in the previous section ,",
    "we computed @xmath27 as a function of @xmath28 , for a range of the kicking and coupling parameters .",
    "these results are now regarded as data .",
    "it should be noted that , although the diffision coefficient @xmath29 plays a fundamental role in developing the scaling theory , it is not necessary to compute that derivative numerically . only the data @xmath27 vs @xmath28 is needed for the computation .    to carry out the scaling - theory calculation , we first compute @xmath30 from ( [ defl ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements in ( [ defl ] ) can be obtained by running the numerical simulation for one kicking step from an initial state that is localized at @xmath31 .",
    "these values of @xmath30 are contained in tables [ tabley3 ] and [ tabley31 ] .",
    "next we use the recurrence relation ( [ s2dif2 ] ) to obtain the scaling theory values for @xmath32 , which we denote as @xmath33 , using @xmath34 as the starting value .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 can not be determined directly , so we must do the recursion calculation for several values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and determine the best values of these two parameters by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the scaling - theory values @xmath33 and the previously computed data for @xmath37 .    the choice of @xmath38 in ( [ s2dif1 ] ) and ( [ s2dif2 ] ) must be made so that @xmath39 varies nearly linearly with @xmath28 during the interval @xmath38 .",
    "taking @xmath40 kicking step has the disadvantage of yielding a curve whose slope might fluctuate considerably from step to step .",
    "it is better to choose a larger value of @xmath38 so as to smooth out such short - time fluctuations , but of course @xmath38 must not be so large as to cover a range over which the curve is appreciably nonlinear .",
    "we found the choice of @xmath41 kicking steps to be a good compromise , but the results are insensitive ( in the first decimal place ) to the precise value that was chosen .",
    "the least - squares fitted values of @xmath36 and @xmath35 were used to calculate the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the values for @xmath43 and the corresponding saturation length @xmath44 , from ( [ lscale ] ) , are listed in tables [ tabley3 ] and [ tabley31 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath43 seem to become nearly constant as we move to the lower right of the tables , away from the transition zone between the localized and quasi - diffisive regions shown in tables [ tablex1 ] and [ tablex2 ] .",
    "this is what we should expect if the scaling hypothesis is valid , and our quasi - diffusive regime is actually a regime of marginal localization for weak disorder .",
    "in contrast to the nearly constant parameter @xmath43 , the localization length @xmath44 varies over orders of magnitude in these ranges of kicking and coupling strengths .",
    "our results are consistent with marginal localization for weak disorder on the scale of @xmath44 .",
    "this paper was motivated by an apparent contradiction between the conclusions of two published papers  @xcite on very similar models of coupled kicked rotors .",
    "one group found quantum localization , while the other reported diffusive behavior .",
    "it was unclear whether the differing conclusions were due to the different criteria for localization used by the two groups , or whether they reflected fundamental differences between the two models , or some other reason . by studying a more general model ,",
    "of which those two are special cases , we were able to resolve the apparent contradiction .",
    "the two models do , indeed , belong to the same generic class and have similar behavior .",
    "when the two criteria for localization are applied to the same model in the same range of parameters , they always agree .",
    "the differences between the results reported by the two groups were primarily due to their use of very different interaction strengths and kicking intervals .",
    "beyond resolving this discrepancy in the literature , our study of two coupled kicked rotors with two different coupling interactions has revealed some interesting systematic behavior as the kicking and coupling strength parameters are varied .",
    "the classical model exhibits diffusive motion . an analytic formula for the dependence of the classical diffusion coefficient on the kicking and coupling strength parameters",
    "was derived , by means of a random - phase approximation .",
    "the numerically computed diffusion coefficient oscillates about this approximate formula , much as occurs for uncoupled rotors .",
    "as the couplings between the rotors become large , the behavior of the rotors is determined mainly by the sum of the two coupling parameters , @xmath45 .",
    "this generalization holds , at least qualitiatively , for the quantum rotors too .",
    "the quantum mechanical model shows classical diffusion at short times , but at long times the diffusion is limited by a kind of quantum localization . for zero coupling strength ,",
    "the model reduces to two independent kicked rotors , each of which exhibits the well - established quantum localization that is the analog of anderson localization in a one - dimensional random lattice .",
    "this single rotor localization behavior persists for a moderate range of couplings between the two rotors .",
    "as the coupling strength increases further , the system passes through a complex transition zone , before entering a quasi - diffusive regime for strong coupling . in this quasi - diffusive regime ,",
    "the mean squared width of the momentum distribution increases with time , but the slope of the curve ( the local diffusion coefficient ) gradually declines . within practical limits of grid size and simulation time , it was not possible to determine directly whether the motion is bounded on a much larger scale or grows without bound .",
    "we found that the marginal localization for weak disorder due to the coupling of the two rotors fits well to this quasi - diffusive motion , and thereby we conclude that the state is very probably localized on a larger scale than our practical computational grid .",
    "we were also able to estimate this large localization scale , which varies smoothly with the coupling strength parameters . in the intermediate region between strong and weak localization , the state - width oscillates in a complicated way , but its envelope always lies beneath that found in the regime of weak localization .",
    "thus we have shown that a system of two coupled kicked rotors exhibits a complex set of behaviors , including a transition from strong to weak localization .",
    "this would be expected from the formal mapping of the two - rotor system onto a two - dimensional anderson lattice . however , this correspondence is not trivial , since the theory of anderson localization assumes a _ random _ lattice potential , whereas the effective potential generated by the kicked - rotor system is not random , but merely quasi - periodic with incommensurate frequencies .",
    "thus the existence of strong and weak localization in the rotor system is not guaranteed by the theory of localization in random lattices .    however , we disagree with one conclusion of adachi _ et al _",
    "@xcite , who claimed that , for sufficiently large coupling strength , the coupled quantum rotors exhibit normal diffusion .",
    "their results were obtained for a special set of parameters , for which the dimensionless kicking interval ( [ alphas ] ) is exactly commensurate with @xmath16 .",
    "such special cases give rise to periodic lattices , for which the quantum states are not localized , regardless of the kicking and coupling strengths .",
    "these highly special cases do not correspond to typical physical situations .",
    "it is more realistic to study the generic non - commensurate case .",
    "we believe that , in the generic case , the two coupled quantum rotors exhibit weak localization on a long time scale .    finally , we mention a possible connection between this model and experiment",
    ". experimental realization of systems like the one considered in the present paper are nowadays intesnly explored .",
    "the experimental observation of 2-dimensional optical localization have been reported  @xcite , where the localized results were shown to match with the predictions of scaling theory .",
