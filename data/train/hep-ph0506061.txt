    "the four experiments at lep have searched for higgs bosons up to a mass of approximately 115 gev  @xcite . although no strong indication of a higgs has been detected by lep , excesses with statistical significances of 2.3@xmath2 and 1.7@xmath2",
    "have been reported for higgs - like events corresponding to masses of 98  gev and 115  gev , respectively .",
    "very recently , it has been pointed out by manuel drees that both of these excesses reported by lep could be accommodated within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as signatures of the two cp - even higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "one of the reason that the lep excess at 98  gev has received so little attention might be that the rate observed corresponding to this mass is about a factor of ten below that which would be expected from a standard model higgs boson . in the mssm , however , the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath4 coupling is suppressed relative to the value in the standard model by a factor of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mixing angle between the two cp - even higgs bosons and @xmath7 is the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values . to predict the number of events seen at lep for a 98  gev light higgs boson , we constrain @xmath8 ( the precise range of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 we allow is the same as used in ref .",
    "@xcite to allow for easy comparison of results ) .",
    "meanwhile , the analogous coupling of the heavy cp - even higgs is only slightly suppressed below the standard model value and is consistent with the number of events reported by lep corresponding to a 115  gev higgs boson .",
    "these two excesses together yield a combined statistical significance of 3.1@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the mass scale of the mssm higgs sector is usually fixed by the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath12 . in the well  known leading @xmath13 approximation  @xcite",
    ", we can very roughly link the pseudoscalar mass to the two scalar higgs masses in the limit of non - mixing top squarks : @xmath14 in this approximation @xmath15 is the top squark mass , @xmath16 are the neutral higgs masses and @xmath17 is the charged higgs mass .",
    "we immediately see that the existence of two light scalar higgs bosons leads to all of the mssm higgs bosons being fairly light .",
    "this can lead to interesting phenomenology in the mssm . in this article",
    ", we consider the constraints on this scenario from the @xmath18 and @xmath19 branching fractions and the magnetic moment of the muon .",

    "we have varied all masses up to 6  tev , and @xmath24 between 1 and 60 .",
    "we did not assume any specific supersymmetry breaking scenario or unification scheme . to take into account the radiative corrections to the higgs masses , we have used feynhiggs  @xcite , which includes all contributions up to the two - loop level .",
    "we find that this level of precision is needed to obtain an accurate representation of the mssm phenomenology within this class of models .",

    "[ fig : achmuc ] , we confirm the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that the entire mssm higgs sector is required to be rather light to accommodate both excesses reported by lep . in the overwhelming majority of models found , the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs bosons is between 95 and 130  gev and the mass of the charged higgs lies between 110 and 150  gev .",
    "although we do find some points outside of this range , in particular a trail of models extending to the upper right of the figure ( left frame ) , these are quite rare compared to the dense collection of models near @xmath25  gev and @xmath26  gev . for each point shown , we require @xmath27 , @xmath21 and @xmath28 , corresponding to the range needed to match the observations at lep .",

    "we consider some of these constraints within the context of models with 98 and 115  gev higgs bosons .",

    "the supersymmetric processes which are most likely to contribute substantially to this branching ratio involve a charged higgs or a chargino .",
    "these contributions are enhanced by powers of the yukawa coupling @xmath36 for large values of @xmath24 .",
    "in passing we emphasize that there are additional @xmath37 corrections  @xcite which can have huge effects if the mssm spectrum is split between light gluinos or higgsinos and heavier sbottoms , but we will see that this is not the part of parameter space in which we are interested in . if the gluino mass is smaller than 300  gev , the lhc will be swamped by gluino pair production with cross sections as large as @xmath38  pb and the effect of the gluino mass on the charged higgs boson is negligible .    in fig .",

    "note that the preference of larger values of @xmath29 is due to a slight bias toward a finite mssm contribution : if we force the higgs sector to be light , the 2hdm diagrams will lead to an increase of the observable br@xmath45 by typically tens of percent up to factor of two .",
    "this charged higgs contributions consist of a @xmath29 suppressed term and a constant term , but does not exhibit any @xmath29 enhancement ( if we do not consider anomalously large gluino loops ) . because the measured value of br@xmath46 is actually slightly smaller than the standard model prediction , the chargino has to compensate for the 2hdm contribution . because the chargino contribution to br@xmath39 is enhanced by one power of @xmath29 on the amplitude level",

    "[ fig : bsg ] .",
