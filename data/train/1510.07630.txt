    "while many details of the galaxy - formation process remain largely unresolved , it is generally believed that large spiral galaxies like the milky way have been assembled from numerous low- to intermediate - mass clumps of stars and gas , each of which is found in its own dark matter sub - halos , through mergers and accretions onto more massive halos . the emerging picture , supported by a number of recent large cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is a generic expectation that the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) , kinematics , and spatial distributions of the stellar populations formed primarily from early mergers and in situ star formation differ from those that formed primarily from accretion .    in the past decade",
    "our view of the nature of the halo of the galaxy has also evolved substantially , with considerable observational support for the suggestion that it comprises at least two distinct diffuse stellar components , the inner - halo and outer - halo populations ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) , with substantial contributions from the debris of relatively recent accretion events ( such as the sagittarius stream ) in the outer regions of the halo @xcite , in contrast to the previously assumed monolithic halo . in any event , it is clear that full understanding of the complex nature of the milky way s halo system is required in order to constrain models for the structural and chemical evolution of large spirals like our own .    the first inferences for a dual halo relied on a sample of stars exploring only a nearby region ( @xmath7 kpc ) , so that accurate proper motions could be used @xcite .",
    "this led to criticism ( e.g. , @xcite ; refuted by @xcite ) that the derived space motions were affected by distance - scale errors , creating the illusion of a dual halo .",
    "interpretations based on more distant in situ samples of stars , exploring regions many tens of kpc away @xcite , have now firmly established the presence of trends in the mean metallicities , as well as in individual abundance ratios ( [ ca / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] ) , indicating that the diffuse halo outside the local region behaves in essentially the manner required by the initial claims of @xcite and others .",
    "the apparent differences in the frequencies of the sub - classes of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stars that can be associated with the inner- and outer - halo populations are also difficult to reconcile with a single - halo model @xcite .",
    "another limiting factor in consideration of the nature of the halo is that it has proven extremely challenging to assemble what might be referred to as a `` fair '' sample of stellar probes .",
    "`` historical samples , '' going back to selections based on high proper motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) necessarily confounded kinematics with chemistry , under the assumption that this would not severely impact interpretations of the mdf from a single - halo population .",
    "others approached the problem by selecting samples of halo stars based on the apparent weakness of metallic lines ( in particular k ) from objective - prism surveys , which necessarily distorts the mdf of the more metal - rich stars in favor of producing samples of the most metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the above was first explored by @xcite , who produced a photometric - metallicity map based on estimates from sdss @xmath8 photometry , although it was acknowledged that the techniques employed failed for metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath9 , so tests for the presence of a very low - metallicity outer - halo population could not be made .",
    "* hereafter a13 ) explored a refined approach to the photometric metallicity - estimation technique , based on comparisons of @xmath2 photometry with well - calibrated cluster fiducial sequences . for a sample of several thousand stars from sdss stripe 82 , selected to span a limited range of main - sequence mass and apparent magnitude ( resulting in distance limits 5 - 8 kpc from the sun ) ,",
    "a13 were able to obtain the first fair sample of local halo stars , one that is unbiased in _ both _ kinematics and chemistry ( covering the metallicity range @xmath10 } \\le -1.0 $ ] , and perhaps a little lower ) .",
    "the relatively limited number of stars in their final sample ( @xmath11 ) and the influence of photometric errors on metallicity estimates at the low end of the mdf prevented them from confirming the presence of a dual halo from the derived mdf alone , as compared to a `` simple model '' distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  the data were statistically consistent with being drawn from either model of the parent population .",
    "however , a13 _ were _ able to demonstrate , on the basis of an approximate rotational measure ( derived from proper motions of stars at high galactic latitudes ) that stars with retrograde velocities clearly favored the lowest metallicity stars in their sample , and concluded that a single halo population was inconsistent with this result .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter j14 ) revisited the sdss stripe 82 @xmath2 data , producing a `` depth optimized '' co - add sample with fainter limiting magnitudes and reduced errors in the final photometry .",
    "@xcite used these data to assemble a catalog of photometric metallicity estimates for a half million stars , spanning a large color and metallicity range .",
    "it appears , however , that their method of metallicity estimation suffers from similar limitations at low metallicity as did the @xcite approach , rendering it unsuitable for exploration of the halo mdf for [ fe / h ] @xmath12 , where the potential contribution from outer - halo stars becomes dominant .",
    "hence , in the present paper we have used the approach of a13 and apply it to the j14 co - adds , in order to explore anew the nature of the derived halo mdf with a substantially larger sample of stars with improved photometric metallicity estimates .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we employ @xmath2 photometry for stripe  82 from the co - added imaging frames in j14 , a catalog that is almost two magnitudes deeper than the single - epoch photometry in sdss .",
    "compared to @xcite , the photometry is also deeper by @xmath13@xmath14  mag , due to the use of more repeated image scans in the co - add procedure . following the prescription in j14 , we used aperture photometry with @xmath15 pixel ( @xmath16 ) diameter aperture , and applied aperture corrections based on the difference from the photometry with @xmath17 pixel ( @xmath18 ) aperture for relatively bright stars ( @xmath19 ) in each field .",
    "we selected good photometry based on the sextractor extraction flag set to zero in each band .",
    "we then assembled matched photometry in five filter passbands using a @xmath20 search radius .",
    "figure  @xmath21 of a13 illustrates our selection of halo main - sequence stars .",
    "higher - mass main - sequence stars can be used to probe a more distant volume than lower - mass stars , because they are intrinsically brighter than less - massive ones .",
    "the mass - luminosity relations also depend strongly on metallicity , so metal - poor stars are seen at larger distances at a given stellar mass .",
    "these relatively well - known relations between stellar mass , luminosity , and metallicity set a strict constraint on the sample selection from a large photometric database , if one desires to obtain an unbiased sample against metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , there is no adequate distance - mass bin that is essentially bias - free over a large range in metallicity .",
    "instead , we focused our analysis on metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath22 ) to construct an unbiased mdf of the halo system , as in a13 .",
    "photometric metallicities are sensitive to the size of photometric errors in the @xmath23 passband , because the technique relies on strong metallic - line blanketing in this short wavelength band . in a13 , we used photometry of stars with @xmath24  mag , or @xmath25  mag and @xmath26  mag in the calibration @xcite and co - added @xcite catalogs , corresponding to maximum heliocentric distances of @xmath27  kpc and @xmath28  kpc , respectively . with the new co - add catalog of j14 , we can extend our photometric metallicity estimates of stars out to @xmath29  kpc from the sun , by virtue of its fainter @xmath23-band limit ( @xmath30  mag at @xmath31  mag ) .",
    "other sample - selection criteria are the same as in a13 : stars must be detected in all five @xmath2 pass bands , with a reduced @xmath32 value of a model fit less than 3 for each star , and located at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath33 ) , with a minimum heliocentric distance of @xmath34  kpc in order to minimize contamination from disk - system stars .",
    "a minimum mass of @xmath35 was set by the minimum heliocentric distance and the above mass - luminosity - metallicity limit .",
    "the maximum stellar mass was set to @xmath36 , since stars with @xmath37 are near the main - sequence turn - off at the lower end of our metallicity estimate ( [ fe / h ] @xmath38 ) .",
    "our updated mdf of the halo is presented as a black histogram in figure  [ fig : mdf ] ( see also table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , which comprises a stellar sample that is almost a factor of two larger ( @xmath39 at [ fe / h]@xmath40 ) than those of the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* red histogram ; @xmath41 ) or the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blue histogram ; @xmath42 ) catalogs used in our previous effort .",
    "all three sdss catalogs are enormously larger than the kinematically - selected stars in the solar neighborhood from @xcite , for which the mdf is shown in the gray shaded region .",
    "the black dotted histogram in the top panel shows the same mdf as the black solid histogram , but after applying photometric zero - point corrections as proposed by @xcite in both the scan and camcol directions ; the differences are negligible .",

    "as in a13 , we did not employ the simple mass - loss modified model in a leaky box ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , the fractional contribution from the metal - poor component is larger than that found in a13 ( @xmath59 ) , perhaps because we included more distant stars in our sample from the j14 catalog .    in order to inspect the properties of the two chemically- and kinematically - distinct populations",
    ", we combined our photometric metallicity estimates with approximate galactocentric rotational velocities ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "a k - s test rejects a null hypothesis that the two distributions were drawn from the same underlying population at high levels of significance ( @xmath76 for @xmath69 ; @xmath77 for @xmath71 ) .    to provide a check on our inferences",

    "instead of deriving photometric metallicities of stars from synthetic color - magnitude diagrams in the mock catalog , we directly assigned stellar metallicities by drawing from parent gaussian metallicity distributions with peaks at [ fe / h]@xmath79 and @xmath80 for the inner and outer halos , respectively , each of which has a metallicity dispersion of @xmath44  dex .",
    "we adopted the parameters of the velocity ellipsoids ( and derived power - law slopes ) in the halo system from @xcite , where the mean rotational velocities of the two components are @xmath81  km s@xmath64 and @xmath82  km s@xmath64 , respectively ( when @xmath83  km s@xmath64 ) , and power - law slopes of @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the inner- and outer - halo density profiles , respectively .",
    "we generated mock catalogs of stars along the stripe  82 footprint with the same limit in galactic latitude ( @xmath86 ) . to match our mass - luminosity - metallicity criterion , we restricted simulated stars to @xmath87 ( see figure  11 in a13 ) , along with @xmath88  kpc .",

    "each panel shows a distribution of stars with the same @xmath60 ( or [ fe / h ] ) cut as in the left - hand column . in the middle column",
    ", we used a `` projected @xmath60 , '' computed from proper motions and distances as in our observed dataset . since our stripe  82 sample extends over @xmath89 and @xmath90 , these projected @xmath60 values are systematically higher than the true rotation velocities based on full kinematic information from the mock catalog ( right - hand column ) .",
    "as shown in the lower panels in the middle column of figure  [ fig : feh ] , a shift in the peak metallicity ( and tails ) of the simulated dataset is clearly present , similar in nature to the observed dataset , when divided into stars with prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "each subsample includes both inner- and outer - halo stars , because of their large velocity dispersions , but the shift in the overall mdfs can be understood as due to the different contributions from each of the components in the @xmath60 cuts .",
    "we looked for the best - matching fraction of inner / outer halos in the models by changing their relative contributions , and found that @xmath91@xmath92 inner - halo fractions provide acceptable matches to the observed mdfs and @xmath60 distributions in figures  [ fig : feh ] and [ fig : vphi ] .",
    "lower ( or higher ) inner - halo fractions result in a significant enhancement ( or depression ) of the outer - halo component , yielding incompatible matches to these distributions . in all cases ,",
    "a single - population diffuse - halo model is rejected .",
    "in this letter we have employed the deep photometric co - add catalog of stripe  82 ( j14 ) to derive new estimates of photometric metallicities for halo main - sequence stars , and obtained a fair mdf based on more distant in situ samples of stars than available in our previous work .",
    "our results show that stars with retrograde orbits have , on average , lower metallicities than stars with prograde rotations , consistent with previous results from a13 , but with even higher statistical significance .",
    "the estimated fraction of the metal - poor or outer - halo component in the local volume is @xmath93 .",
    "the presence of two distinct diffuse stellar halos implies that the formation of the halo system must have involved at least two different star - formation episodes .",
    "according to recent theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , inner - halo population stars formed from more massive sub - halos , or dwarf galaxies with sufficient gas content that could reach the inner region of the proto - galaxy through dynamical friction , or formed in situ in the inner region from the rapid collapse of primordial gas .",
    "sustained star formation in this region would lead to higher metallicity .",
    "in contrast , stars of the outer - halo population formed in lower mass dwarf galaxies , and were brought into the main halo of the milky way through disruption and accretion , resulting in a diffuse outer halo with distinct and significantly hotter kinematics , which is present throughout the halo system of the galaxy , including the inner - halo region . a limited star - formation history , perhaps involving no more than a single burst , would lead to lower metallicity .",
    "the situation is likely to be complex , and dependent on both the star - formation history within individual sub - halos , and on their merger and accretion histories ( see discussions by @xcite and @xcite ) . in any event , one would expect to find samples of old stars arising from both populations in the local volume .",
    "this interpretation has received recent support from the identification by @xcite of the so - called `` ancient chronographic sphere '' , a region comprising the oldest stars in the milky way located within 15 kpc from the galactic center , and extending into the region we have analyzed in the present paper .",
    "our work is limited by the photometric precision and kinematic measurement errors in the currently available survey data , as well as the relatively small volume of space explored by stripe  82 .",
    "however , it clearly demonstrates the feasibility of dissecting stellar populations in more distant regions of the halo with future large photometric and astrometric surveys such as the large synoptic sky survey ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
