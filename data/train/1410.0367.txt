    "the physics of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and its connection with galaxies are key to understanding the evolution of baryonic matter in the universe .",
    "the igm is the main reservoir of baryons at all epochs ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fukugita et al . 1998 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shull et al . 2012 ) ) , and provides the primordial material for forming galaxies .",
    "once galaxies are formed , supernovae ( sne ) and active - galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback inject energy in the interstellar medium , some of which escapes the galaxies as winds , enriching the igm with metals ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wiersma et al . 2011 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ford et al . 2014 ) ) .",
    "because of the continuous interplay between the igm and galaxies , it is sensible ( if not necessary ) to study these two concepts simultaneously ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "resides also plays an important role .",
    "given that baryonic matter is expected to fall into the considerably deeper gravitational potentials of dark matter , the igm gas and galaxies should be predominantly found at such locations , forming the so - called cosmic web  ( ( * ? ? ? * bond et al . 1996 ) ) .",
    "galaxies appear to follow the filamentary structure which simulations predict ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* springel et al . 2006 ) ) , and their properties are partly shaped by environmental effects ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , much less is known about the _",
    "actual _ properties and distribution of the igm in different cosmological environments .",
    "this is so because the only feasible way to observe the bulk of the igm is through intervening absorption line systems in the spectra of bright background sources ( e.g. quasi - stellar objects , gamma - ray bursts , galaxies ) , which limits its characterization to being one - dimensional .",

    "our key findings can be summarized as follows : ( i ) there is a significant excess of igm gas at the edges of galaxy voids with respect to the random expectation , _ consistent _ with the overdensity of galaxies defining such voids ; and ( ii ) inside galaxy voids the igm gas matches the random expectation , _ inconsistent _ with the underdensity of galaxies defining such voids . in other words , there were no apparent igm voids detected at the positions of galaxy voids .",
    "we also showed that the column density ( @xmath23 ) and doppler parameter ( @xmath24 ) distributions of hi  lines inside and outside galaxy voids were not remarkably different , with only a @xmath25 and @xmath26 probability of rejecting the null - hypothesis of both samples coming from the same parent population , respectively .",
