    "understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is a primary goal in astrophysics . over the past decades , wide and deep surveys at various wavelengths have acquired numerous observational data of galaxies spanning a wide range of galaxy types , magnitudes and distances ( see * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath2 cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm can explain the formation of the large scale structures governed by dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy .",
    "however , at the scale of galaxies , where baryons play important roles , several inconsistencies remain between the theory and observations . to fully elucidate galaxy formation",
    ", we need to solve the complicated physical processes of baryons within the framework of @xmath2-cdm universe .",
    "one of the most promising ways to address this issue is the hydrodynamical simulations of cosmological galaxy formation , in which the equations of gravity , hydrodynamics , and thermodynamics are solved self - consistently .",
    "however , the mass resolution and box size of these simulations are still limited by computational costs , and the physical processes on scales smaller than the numerical resolution are treated by phenomenological recipes ( the so - called `` sub - grid physics '' ) , which contain large uncertainties ( see * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "`` semi - analytic models '' ( sa models ) are also widely used in studies of cosmological galaxy formation . in sa models , the formation and evolution history of dark matter halos are explicitly modeled by analytical formulae or _ n_-body simulations , while the complicated baryon physics are modeled by phenomenological equations .",
    "the advantage of this technique is its lower computational cost than numerical simulation , enabling us to create a large sample of mock galaxies covering the wide range of physical properties such as mass , magnitude , and spatial scale .",
    "we can also investigate a wide range of the parameter space and test various models of the baryon physics .",
    "however , to discuss the galaxy - scale dynamics , we need to combine sa models ( which do not explicitly treat such dynamics ) with fully numerical simulations .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for more detailed review of the physical models of cosmological galaxy formation .    in this paper",
    "we introduce our new galaxy formation model , _ new numerical galaxy catalog _",
    "( @xmath0gc ) , an updated version of _ numerical galaxy catalog _ ( @xmath1gc ) presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n05 ; see also @xcite ) . our model is an sa model , in which we directly extract the merger trees of dm halos from _",
    "n_-body simulations , following the pioneering work of @xcite . the @xmath1gc model and its variants",
    "have been used in many studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "major updates of the new model from the version of n05 are as follows : ( 1 ) @xmath0gc adopts the new _ n_-body simulations of dm halos recently presented by @xcite , ( 2 ) the formation and evolution process of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and suppression of gas cooling by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are included , ( 3 ) heating of the intergalactic gas by the cosmic uv background is included , and ( 4 ) the parameters are tuned using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "several other groups have also proposed sa models ( see * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "each of these models is based on different _",
    "n_-body simulations and adopts different equations of the baryon physics . for a comparison study of different galaxy formation models ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the noteworthy advantage of our model over other sa models is the unprecedented mass resolution and box size of the _",
    "n_-body simulations of dm halos , on which our galaxy formation model is based .",
    "for example , the minimum halo mass of the best - case model reaches @xmath3 , below the effective jeans mass at high redshift @xcite .",
    "this high mass resolution enables us to investigate the physical properties of galaxies in such low mass halos , that are significantly affected by the heating of the intergalactic gas by the uv background . in our largest simulation box ( 1.12 gpc / h )",
    ", we can investigate rare objects such as bright quasars .",
    "moreover , we adopt the cosmological parameters recently obtained by the planck satellite @xcite . for more detailed comparison with other cosmological _ n_-body simulations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the basic properties of our model , focusing on the nature of local galaxies .",
    "the properties of distant galaxies and agns will be discussed in our forthcoming papers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections [ sec : model ] and [ sec : detparams ] present the details of our model and the parameter fitting method , respectively .",
    "the general properties of our numerical galaxy catalog are presented in section [ sec : catalog ] , and sections [ sec : localresults ] and [ sec : highzresults ] compare the model predictions with the observed properties of local and distant galaxies .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the paper .",
    "the mock galaxy catalog produced by the our new model is publicly available on the web .",
    "in the cdm universe , dm halos hierarchically grow from small to large scales . when a dm halo collapses , the contained gas is heated to virial temperature by shock , and then gradually cools by radiative cooling .",
    "the cooled gas condense into stars ; those stars and dense cold gas constitute galaxies .",
    "the massive stars formed by this process explode as supernovae ( sne ) , blowing out surrounding cold gas .",
    "this process suppresses further star formation ( the so - called `` sn feedback '' ) .",
    "massive stars also eject metals .",
    "galaxies in a common dm halo sometimes merge into more massive galaxies , and galaxy bulge is formed as a merger remnant ; cold gas in the merger remnant is converted into stars with short timescale , a phenomenon called a starburst . during the starburst",
    ", a fraction of the cold gas gets accreted by the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the galaxy center . by repeating these processes , galaxies and smbhs",
    "have formed and evolved to the present epoch .",

    "the mass resolution of the run with the smallest box ( @xmath0gc - h2 ) was @xmath8 , which is sufficient to resolve small dwarf galaxies . by combining these simulations",
    ", we can generate mock catalogs of galaxies and agns with unprecedentedly high resolution and statistical power .",
