    "the inspirals of stellar mass compact objects into supermassive black holes in the centres of galaxies  extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( emris )  are one of the most exciting potential sources of gravitational waves for the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "the detection of such sources in the lisa data stream and parameter estimation for them is a very challenging technical problem , however , as the instantaneous amplitude of a typical signal is an order of magnitude below the noise fluctuations in the detector .",
    "moreover , the long duration of the signals ( lisa will detect up to @xmath0 waveform cycles in an observation ) and the large parameter space of possible sources ( an emri signal depends on fourteen parameters ) makes fully - coherent matched filtering computationally impossible  @xcite .",
    "several possible algorithms have been considered for emri detection . in order to compute initial event rate estimates ,",
    "a semi - coherent algorithm was proposed , in which the data stream would be divided up into short ( two or three week ) segments , that would be searched coherently via matched filtering .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) would then be built up in a second stage via incoherent summation of power along trajectories through the coherent segments  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was designed to make full use of available computing power and its effectiveness has not yet been demonstrated practically .",
    "time - frequency techniques have also been explored  ( @xcite@xcite ) and have been shown to be able to both detect and recover parameters  @xcite when used to search for single , high - snr emris in instrumental noise .",
    "their effectiveness is likely to be significantly reduced when confronted with more realistic situations , in which there are multiple sources overlapping in time and frequency .",
    "however , these algorithms may provide a useful first step in a hierarchical search .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods may provide a way to perform matched filtering more efficiently , without requiring a large template bank of possible signals .",
    "we follow the convention in the literature and call our search a metropolis - hastings monte carlo ( mhmc ) search rather than an mcmc search since it is not actually markovian ( see section  [ mhmcalg ] ) . both mcmc and mhmc methods",
    "have been explored by various groups in the context of lisa data analysis and have been shown to be very effective when searching for toy models  @xcite , for white - dwarf binaries  @xcite and for single or multiple supermassive black hole binaries  ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the use of an mcmc technique for emri searches was explored by stroeer et al .",
    "@xcite , based on a highly simplified model of the emri waveform . in the context of the mock lisa data challenges ( mldcs )  @xcite , monte carlo methods have been used by ourselves and one other group  @xcite to search for the emri sources in the round 2  @xcite and round 1b  @xcite data sets . in this paper",
    ", we describe the algorithm that we have developed for the emri searches , and the performance of the algorithm on the round 1b challenge data sets .",
    "our search code was adapted from the search code developed by cornish and porter  @xcite for supermassive black hole binary searches , but we have incorporated a significant number of refinements that are specific to the emri problem .    the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we describe the search algorithm , including a description of the waveform model , the metropolis - hastings search engine and various refinements we have tried for the emri problem . in section  [ results ] we present the results that we had at the time of the mldc round 1b deadline ( december 2007 ) and compare these to the true source parameters . finally , in section  [ fut ] we discuss planned future refinements of the search algorithm .",
    "the emri sources in the mldc releases to date were constructed using the _ analytic kludge _ ( ak ) model of barack and cutler  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the gravitational waveforms describe emission from a keplerian orbit , but with perihelion and orbital - plane precessions imposed by precessing the observer about the source with rates taken from post - newtonian expressions .",
    "the orbital parameters are also evolved over time using post - newtonian prescriptions to account for radiation reaction .",
    "the emri waveforms have emission at multiple frequencies , corresponding to harmonics of the fundamental frequencies of the orbit  harmonics of the orbital frequency , @xmath1 , arise from the eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath2 ; harmonics of the perihelion precession rate , @xmath3 , arise from this precession ; and harmonics of the orbital - plane precession rate , @xmath4 , are present due to the inclination , @xmath5 , of the orbital plane relative to the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "the frequency of a given waveform harmonic is given by three integers , @xmath6 , as @xmath7 .",
    "the ak waveforms are purely quadrupole in nature , and so @xmath8 , but @xmath9 is unrestricted .",
    "however , the eccentricity at plunge of the mldc sources is limited to @xmath10 $ ] , and so harmonics with @xmath11 are generally weak .    in our search code ,",
    "to speed up waveform evaluation , we use a truncated version of the ak model .",
    "we include only the @xmath12 and @xmath13 harmonics in the waveform model ( harmonics with @xmath14 are significantly suppressed relative to the @xmath13 harmonics ) .",
    "in addition , we expand the bessel functions that appear in the model  @xcite in powers of eccentricity , and keep only the three leading terms in the expansion of @xmath15 for each @xmath9 . we include the full lisa tdi response function to account for detector motions , and use parameters evaluated at plunge to characterize the waveforms ( this is in contrast to the mldc convention , which is to specify parameters at the start of the observation ) .",
    "the resulting waveforms are faithful approximations to the full ak waveforms .",
    "the overlap between an ak and truncated waveform , evaluated at the same waveform parameters , is at worst @xmath16 , and is typically @xmath17 .",
    "the overlap tends to be higher for sources with higher mass central black holes , for which the emission is mostly at lower frequencies ( for @xmath18 the overlap always exceeds @xmath19 ) .",
    "the template parameter error , i.e. , the difference between the parameters of the best - fit truncated waveform and the parameters of the true ak waveform , is also relatively small . in table",
    "[ parambias ] we list the parameter errors for one of the mldc round 2 training sources .",
    "these results were obtained by starting an mcmc chain at the true parameter values and allowing it to evolve to evaluate the posterior .",
    "the difference between the mean of the recovered posterior and the true parameter values provided an estimate of the bias in our truncated model .",
    "we note that since the data stream we were searching included noise we expected and saw a noise - induced bias in the parameter estimation .",
    "however , we could distinguish this noise bias from the model errors .",
    "the parameter offset values in table  [ parambias ] are typical for mldc type sources .",
    "the parameters are the same as those used for the mldc  compact object mass ( @xmath20 ) , central black hole mass ( @xmath21 ) , initial orbital frequency ( @xmath22 ) , luminosity distance ( @xmath23 ) , initial eccentricity ( @xmath24 ) , central black hole spin ( @xmath25 ) , ecliptic latitude and longitude ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , orientation of central black hole spin ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , orbital inclination ( @xmath5 ) and three initial orbital phases ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) . for most parameters ,",
    "the error is at most @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the noise - induced uncertainty in the parameter , as estimated from the width of the posterior .",
    "the error is somewhat larger for the initial phase angles , as the effect of the truncation accumulates over the observation , but these parameters are uninteresting astrophysically .",
    "overall , the truncated model provides an estimate of the parameters that is sufficiently close to the true parameters to ensure that a follow - up refinement with full ak waveforms would be quick .",
    ".percentage difference between the parameters of the best - fit truncated waveform and the parameters of the true ak waveform .",
    "the true ak waveform is the 1.3.2 training waveform from mldc round 2 , for which the parameters are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . [",

    "our final search algorithm for identifying isolated emris in instrumental noise was as follows : 1 ) run a set of chains without annealing for a small number of chain steps ; 2 ) identify harmonics of the true signal from the highest snr points found in the preliminary chains ; 3 ) run a partially constrained search , including temperature and time annealing , to refine the source parameters .",
    "the search runs were incomplete at the time of the mldc deadline , but subsequent runs have moved closer to what we now know are the true parameters . the convergence rate is slow , however , so we are currently exploring several improvements to the algorithm , including    * _ fast waveform model . _ by using the low - frequency approximation to the detector response , and interpolation of the barycentre waveform , it is possible to speed up the waveform and fim evaluations which are the bottlenecks in the current code . * _ semi - coherent analysis .",
    "_ as considered for template based searches in  @xcite , by dividing the data stream into sections of a few months in length , and searching these separately in parallel , the search speed is increased .",
    "the main difficulty is forcing parameter consistency between the different segments . * _ delayed rejection .",
    "_ this is a technique whereby the chain is forced to accept a ( large ) jump in the parameter space , but the likelihood at the original point , @xmath49 , is recorded . the chain is then allowed to run ( with small jumps ) for a pre - specified number of steps , e.g. , 100 , to reach a final point , @xmath50 , before the metropolis - hastings ratio is evaluated using @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "if this step is rejected , the chain goes back to @xmath49 and another jump is proposed .",
    "this technique can help the chain jump to widely separated secondaries in the parameter space , and it might also encourage the chain to switch to the correct antipodal sky position , as mentioned earlier . *",
    "_ numerical f - statistic _ it is relatively straightforward to construct a proposal that changes the intrinsic parameters of the source in order to achieve a rotation of the signal harmonics , i.e. , to keep the dominant harmonic in the same place , but change the indices @xmath51 of that harmonic .",
    "however , it will usually be necessary to change the extrinsic parameters and phase angles in order to find a high snr at the new point .",
    "this can be accomplished by proposing a jump in the intrinsic parameters , and then finding the best - fit extrinsic parameters at the new point , either by using a template grid or by using a mini ( @xmath52 iteration ) monte carlo chain that explores only the extrinsic parameters .",
    "the likelihood maximized over extrinsic parameters can then be used to evaluate the metropolis - hastings ratio for the proposed jump in intrinsic parameters .",
    "a short - coming of the algorithm described here will become apparent when the data stream becomes more complex and contains multiple sources , as in mldc round 3 . when multiple sources are present , distinguishing between a weak harmonic that is a side - band of an identified bright source and one that is the dominant harmonic of a second , weaker signal , is difficult",
    ". the location in time and frequency , and the shape of the track , will be useful diagnostics , but some confusion will be inevitable . as an alternative to identifying harmonics to use as constraints , an understanding of how harmonic rotations / shifts can be achieved by parameter changes should allow the formulation of proposal distributions that will move the chain from one secondary to another ( similar to the `` island hopping '' used in supermassive black hole binary searches  @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of such a proposal would be to make the chain jump between points in parameter space that had harmonics in common with the true signal and hence the chain should find the true parameters more quickly .",
    "such proposals will be explored when we apply these algorithms to the round 3 data .",
