    "4u  2129 + 47 and exo  0748 - 676 are two low - mass x - ray binaries which undergo high / low transitions in their x - ray flux .",
    "both are viewed nearly edge on , and their eclipse lightcurves show evidence for an extended x - ray emission region often called an accretion disk corona ( adc ) .",
    "4u  2129 + 47 is currently the only adc source in a low state , and was very well studied in the 1980s when it was in the high state .",
    "exo  0748 - 676 is currently in the high state , but was serendipitously observed in a low state by the einstein observatory before it was discovered as a bright transient source ( parmar 1986 ) .",
    "the optical and x - ray lightcurves of 4u  2129 + 47 in the 1970s and 1980s showed a v - shaped partial eclipse , which lead to the model of a partial eclipse of an extended x - ray emission region ( mcclintock 1982 ) .",
    "the inclination is believed to be high enough so that the accreting neutron star is not directly visible , but is shielded from our view by vertical structure at the outer edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the x - rays we do observe are only the few percent of those emitted from the vicinity of the neutron star which are scattered into our line of sight by the adc .",
    "exosat observations in 1983 failed to detect the source , and the optical modulation seen previously was also found to be missing ( peitch 1986 ) .",
    "we previously reported on observations of this source in quiescence with the rosat hri , which , although sufficient to detect the source at @xmath5erg / s , could not measure the spectrum or a detailed lightcurve ( garcia 1994 ) .",
    "exo  0748 - 676 was discovered in outburst with exosat ( parmar 1986 ) . while it shows sharp ( square wave )",
    "eclipses , there is a residual flux of a few percent at the bottom of the eclipse .",
    "this residual flux is interpreted as due to an accretion disk corona , which covers a large geometric area and is therefore not fully eclipsed .",
    "it was serendipitously observed with the einstein ipc before it entered the high , discovery state .",
    "because of their transient nature , 4u  2129 + 47 and exo  0748 - 676 are often referred to as soft x - ray transients ( sxt ) .",
    "several sxt have been shown to have mass functions @xmath6 , and on this basis are considered black holes , or bh  sxt ( van paradijs and mcclintock 1995 , tanaka and shibazaki 1996 ) . because they show type  i x - ray bursts , 4u  2129 + 47 and exo  0748 - 676 clearly contain neutron stars ( ns ) , and are therefore ns  sxt .",
    "observations of bh  sxt provide good evidence that they accrete via advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf , narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 , narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) , rather than by thin disks , when they are in quiescence .",
    "the theoretical basis for adaf applies equally well to ns  sxt in quiescence ( yi 1996 ) .",
    "detailed study of the accretion including the effects of a rotating magnetic field certainly allow that adafs exist in ns sxt ( menou 1999 ) .",
    "comparison of outburst and quiescent x - ray luminosities in sxt may have provided evidence for the existence of event horizons in bh  sxt .",
    "( narayan , garcia , & mcclintock 1997a , garcia 1998 , asia 1998 ) .",
    "extending the small sample of objects used in these studies may help to prove ( or disprove ) this fundamental result ; hence these observations of two ns  sxt in quiescence are of interest .",
    "in addition , these source are of interest because they offer opportunity to study the way the structure of the accretion disk and adc are effected by wide variations in the x - ray flux of the central source .",
    "accretion disk models predict that the both the vertical structure and the run of temperature with radius changes dramatically under the influence of strong x - ray irradiation ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , vrtilek 1990 ) , but there are few chances to confirm these predictions over wide variations in luminosity .",
    "the adc is formed as a result of the strong x - ray irradiation ( begelman , mckee & shields 1983 ) , and once again there are few opportunities to study its structure ( in a single source ) over very wide ranges in x - ray luminosity .",
    "exo  0748 - 676 was serendipitously observed in its low state during a 10  ks observation with the _ einstein _ observatory in may  1980 .",
    "the rosat pspc observed 4u  2129 + 47 in the low state for a total of @xmath730  ks on 3  june  1994 , and these data were processed with the standard sass pipeline .",
    "both datasets were analyzed using iraf / pros v2.3.1 and xspec v10.0 .",
    "poisson weighting of the errors ( gehrels 1986 ) was used .",
    "the results from pros and xspec were found to be consistent . when necessary , we grouped the data in larger energy bins in order to maintain the number of counts per bin  9 .",
    "previous studies have shown that under these conditions , the results from poisson weighting of @xmath8 fitting are consistent with those from maximum likelyhood methods ( narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997b )    in order to guide our extraction of the source counts from the images , we first generated the azimuthally averaged radial profile of counts centered on the sources . for 4u2129 + 47 we found that a @xmath9 radius extraction maximized the s / n .",
    "for exo  0748 - 676 , we found that a @xmath10 radius extraction maximized the s / n .",
    "for both sources the background was determined from a larger annulus around the source .    for both sources , we found that a variety of simple models ( raymond - smith thermal , bremsstrahlung , blackbody , power law ) gave equally acceptable fit results .",
    "as our main interest in the spectral fitting is to derive quiescent luminosities , in order to allow comparisons between ns and bh luminosity swings ( i.e. , narayan 1997a , asai 1998 ) we limit ourselves below to simple black - body fits and compute unabsorbed luminosities over the 0.5 - 10  kev range .",
    "we note that the computed luminosities are insensitive to the exact form of the spectrum , for example , using a bremsstrahlung spectrum results in only 10% changes in the luminosities .      the @xmath11  source counts extracted from the ipc image were fit to a variety of simple spectral models .",
    "the best fit blackbody parameters are @xmath12  kev , @xmath13@xmath4 .",
    "the very low number of counts allow a wide range in acceptable parameters . in order to limit the parameter space ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to log(@xmath14  @xmath4 ( which is within the allowed range ) .",
    "this is the value predicted by the relation of predehl and schmitt ( 1995 ) , given the optical reddening of e(b - v)@xmath15 ( schoembs and soeschinger 1990 ) .",
    "we then computed the confidence regions for temperature and emitted ( unabsorbed ) luminosity , as shown in figure  1 . the best fit blackbody temperature and 0.5 - 10.0  kev luminosity , assuming a distance of 10  kpc ( parmar 1986 ) , are    @xmath16    @xmath17    these results are fairly insensitive to the value of @xmath18 assumed , in that a 50% increase results in only a 15% decrease in best fit temperature and a 20% increase in the emitted 0.5 - 10.0  kev luminosity .",
    "this energy band contains  70% of the bolometric luminosity at the best fit temperature . at the lowest temperatures allowed by the 90% confidence interval ( figure  1 ) ,",
    "this band contains only 30% of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the effective radius of this possible blackbody emitter ( @xmath19 ) is @xmath20  km , comparable to the radius of a neutron star .      various simple models ( as above )",
    "give acceptably good fits to the @xmath21 source counts extracted from the image , and the fit statistics show no preference for one model over any other .",
    "the best fitting black body model has @xmath22  kev and @xmath23@xmath4 . as with exo  0748 - 676",
    ", we fix the absorption at the optically determined value ( which is within the fit range ) in order to reduce the allowed parameter range .",
    "the optical extinction has been found to be @xmath24 ( cowley & schmidtke 1990 ) , which corresponds to @xmath25 ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "we then computed the confidence regions for temperature and emitted ( unabsorbed ) luminosity , as shown in figure  2 . the best fit blackbody temperature and 0.5 - 10.0  kev luminosity , assuming a distance of 6.3  kpc ( parmar 1986 ) are    @xmath26    @xmath27    we note that this @xmath28 is measured to the f7iv counterpart of 4u2129 + 47 , which is clearly not the secondary transferring mass to the neutron star . in using this @xmath28 and a spectroscopic distance of 6.3  kpc ( cowley & schmidtke 1990 ) we are implicitly assuming that this star is in the physical proximity of the mass transferring binary ( thorstensen 1988 , garcia 1989 , cowley & schmidtke 1990 , van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 .",
    ")    once again , these results are fairly insensitive to the value of @xmath29 assumed , in that a 50% increase results in only a 10% drop in best fit temperature and a 40% increase in the emitted bolometric luminosity .",
    "the 0.5 - 10.0  kev band contains @xmath30% of the bolometric luminosity at the best fit temperature , and @xmath11% at the lowest allowed temperature .",
    "the effective radius of this possible blackbody emitter ( @xmath31 ) is @xmath32  km , substantially smaller than the radius of a neutron star .",
    "we previously reported the quiescent rosat hri flux ( garcia 1994 ) , assuming the spectral parameters measured in the high state .",
    "this overestimates the flux by a factor of two . when the softer quiescent spectrum determined above",
    "is used we calculate an emitted luminosity ( 0.5 - 10.0  kev ) of @xmath33ergs  s@xmath34 .",
    "the 68% confidence bounds on the pspc spectrum correspond to a @xmath35 uncertainty in the calculation of the hri flux .",
    "thus it appears that the source has faded by a factor of @xmath36 during the 2.5  year interval between the hri and pspc observations .",
    "we generated the quiescent lightcurve of 4u  2129 + 47 ( figure  3 ) by binning the background subtracted pspc data into 7 bins based on the mcclintock  1982 ephemeris .",
    "two other lightcurves are plotted in figure  3 : the scaled on - state lightcurve re - extracted from the ipc cd - rom archive , and a square - wave lightcurve with an eclipse width of  0.1 .",
    "the eclipse duration of this last lightcurve is @xmath37 the width of the high - state eclipse , which is what one expects if the x - ray source was a point ( rather than extended ) source .    in order to determine if the observed low - state lightcurve was well described by either the square - wave or the scaled on - state lightcurve , we calculated the chi - squared for each of these .",
    "the trial lightcurves were first artificially binned to match the sampling of the observed ( 7 bin ) lightcurve . for the scaled on - state lightcurve",
    "we calculate a reduced @xmath8 for 6  degrees of freedom of @xmath38 ( 80% random probability ) , and for the square wave we find @xmath39 ( 10% random probability ) .",
    "clearly either trial lightcurve is an acceptable representation of the observations , although the scaled on - state lightcurve may be somewhat favored .    given the limited statistics , one might reasonably ask if any source variability has been formally detected at all . testing the 7  bin lightcurve against a steady source we find @xmath40 , clearly allowing that the source is steady .",
    "however , two other tests provide evidence that some sort of an eclipse still occurs in the quiescent state .",
    "first , we have cross - correlated the observed 7  bin lightcurve against the scaled on - state curve in order to determine the phase of minimum light . the best fit phase and 68% confidence limits are @xmath41 on the ephemeris of mcclintock ( 1982 ) .",
    "the accumulated error in the ephemeris is @xmath42 , so while the present data agrees with this ephemeris it is not able to refine it .",
    "given the large error in the determination of phase zero , this provides only weak evidence for an eclipse .",
    "second , we binned the data into 4  equal bins , one of which is centered on the eclipse phase . testing this more coarsely binned lightcurve against a steady source we find @xmath43 , which has a random probability of only @xmath44 for a steady source .",
    "in addition , the minimum of this binned lightcurve occurs at the expected phase of eclipse , which has a random probability of 1 in 4 .",
    "this provides somewhat stronger evidence that an eclipse may still be occurring at phase zero .",
    "a glance at figure  3 shows that the quiescent lightcurve appears remarkably similar to a scaled version of the outburst lightcurve .",
    "however , the statistics are poor , and the lightcurve binned into 7  phase intervals is formally consistent with a steady source , a square wave ( eclipse ) , or a scaled version of the on - state lightcurve . however , when binned more coarsely the lightcurve provides tantalizing evidence that there is an eclipse occurring at the expected phase .",
    "this result differs somewhat from what we found in the rosat hri data obtained @xmath45  years before these data .",
    "the hri data excluded a scaled version of the outburst lightcurve , and these pspc data allow it . given that the source flux decreased by a factor of @xmath36 between the observations , it would not be surprising if the lightcurve also changed shape . however , the statistical uncertainties of the hri lightcurve are large , and ( like the pspc lightcurve ) they allow the possibility that the source was constant .",
    "the eclipse ( square wave ) lightcurve is what one expects based on the standard models of the system . at this low luminosity ,",
    "the adc should have collapsed ( white & holt 1982 , begelman , mckee & shields 1983 ) , and the secondary should eclipse the x - ray emission from the neutron star for @xmath46 of the orbit .",
    "a smoothly modulated lightcurve would be hard to understand , as it would imply that the structure of the accretion disk has not changed despite the observed large change in x - ray luminosity , and presumably mass transfer rate .    in the high state ,",
    "the modulation of the x - ray flux was accompanied by a strong modulation of the optical flux .",
    "what optical modulation should we expect given the apparent modulation in the low - state x - ray flux ? in order to answer this question we need an estimate of the quiescent disk v magnitude , which we make by comparing 4u  2129 + 47 to cen x-4 .",
    "this sxt also contains a ns primary , and the quiescent disk has been measured to have an absolute magnitude @xmath47 ( mcclintock & remillard 1990 )",
    ". the disk in cen x-4 may be somewhat bigger than that in 4u  2129 + 47 due to its longer period ( 15.1  h ) , and also may appear somewhat brighter due to its more face - on viewing angle ( @xmath48 , shahbaz , naylor & charles 1993 ) . based on the amplitude of the optical modulation in outburst ( mcclintock , remillard , & margon 1981 ) and the correlation between modulation and inclination ( van paradijs , van der klis , & pedersen 1988 ) ,",
    "the inclination of 4u  2129 + 47 is likely to be @xmath49  80@xmath50 .",
    "the differences in the period and inclination would lower our estimate of the absolute magnitude of the quiescent disk in 4u  2129 + 47 by several magnitudes , based on the correlations found in cataclysmic variables ( i.e. , equations 2.63 and 3.3 from warner 1995 ) .",
    "thus @xmath47 is a comfortable lower limit to the quiescent disk in 4u  2129 + 47 . at the 6.3  kpc distance of 4u  2129 + 47 , and with @xmath51 ,",
    "this disk would have @xmath52 .",
    "the quiescent counterpart has @xmath53 , so even if the disk were 100% modulated we would expect a fractional modulation of only @xmath54 , which is well below the observed limit of 1.2% amplitude ( 99% confidence , thorstensen 1988 ) .      the x - ray temperatures of @xmath55  kev which we find for these two sxt in quiescence are similar to those found for other ns  sxt ( verbunt 1994 .",
    "asai 1996 , asai 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the luminosity of 4u  2129 + 47 is also similar to that found in these sources , but exo  0748 - 676 is at the extreme high end of the distribution ( narayan 1997a ) .",
    "there is no obvious reason for this , in particular the orbital period of exo  0748 - 676 is typical , so the average mass transfer rate should be typical as well ( menou 1999 ) . given the observed variability of quiescent ns  sxt ( campana 1998 ) , it is possible that the single quiescent measurement caught this system in a particularly luminous state .",
    "the emitting radius we compute assuming a black - body spectrum is smaller than a ns in the case of 4u  2129 + 47 . black - body fits often indicate emitting areas smaller than a ns surface , indicating either that the accretion is channeled onto a small fraction of the ns surface ( asai 1996 , menou 1999 ) or that the black - body spectral fits erroneously indicate a small surface area ( rajagopal & romani 1996 , rutledge 1999 ) .",
    "exo  0748 - 676 is unusual in that the black - body radius is consistent with the entire ns surface , owing to the larger than typical luminosity in quiescence .    in summary , we note that the difference in the luminosity swings of outbursting and quiescent sxt may indicate the existence of event horizons in bh  sxt ( narayan 1997a , garcia 1998 , asai 1998 , menou 1999 , but see chen 1998 for an opposing view )",
    ". observations with axaf and xmm will undoubtedly add more sxt to the studied sample , and push upper limits lower , helping to more definitively test this difference .",
    "xmm may allow an accurate measurement of the quiescent light curve of the eclipsing ns  sxt 4u  2129 + 47 , therefore providing a spatially resolved picture of an adc in a quiescent system .",
