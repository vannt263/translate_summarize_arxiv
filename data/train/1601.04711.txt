    "the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) contains within it a rich variety of structure , ranging from long , slender filaments @xcite , to sheet - like structures @xcite , to the well - known shells and supershells surrounding stellar associations . still unknown , however , is the extent of small - scale structure within these common , larger entities .",
    "recently , the high pressures found within the local leo cold cloud @xcite has shown that structure on the scale of @xmath0200au exists in the cold , diffuse hi within our own local bubble .",
    "the mechanism by which these small - scale features form is still unknown , but may be similar to the formation of filamentary structures via turbulent gas flows within molecular clouds @xcite . based on temporal variation of absorption in hi 21 cm emission from background quasars , @xcite found these small - scale structures to be significantly over - pressured with respect to their surroundings if a spherical geometry was assumed , a result in stark contrast with the long - standing view of an ism in pressure equilibrium @xcite .",
    "heiles rectified this problem by invoking nonspherical geometries ( such as cylinders and disks , or more complicated filaments and sheets ) for these small - scale structures .",
    "alternatively , @xcite argued that observations of small - scale structure in hi are a natural consequence of hierarchical structure in the ism .",
    "further observations in the optical have found a variety of sightlines exhibiting spatial or temporal variations @xcite , primarily in the nai d lines .",
    "however , @xcite highlight a particular issue with using nai d lines to detect variation in the ism . since nai is not the dominant ion of na in the ism , the observed variations in _",
    "n_(nai ) may not be reflective of changes in the total hi column , but rather the result of changes in the physical conditions of the absorbing gas , which leads to an enhancement or dehancement in the nai trace neutral .",
    "thus , it remains unclear if the many variations seen in the optical are indicative of corresponding variations in the hi gas structure , or , rather , of changes in the physical properties of the gas .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) have long been an interesting laboratory for studying the ism .",
    "recently , @xcite reported on the variability of a number of ism absorption components toward several stars in the vela snr , suggesting a connection between ism variability and snrs . here",
    "we focus on the monoceros loop snr , a well - evolved snr ( @xmath0100,000 years old ) with an expansion velocity of @xmath050kms@xmath1 , derived from absorption seen in the approaching and receding edges of the shell at and , from the stars hd  47359 and hd  47240 , respectively @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite determined that the snr is within the mon ob2 association , and also interacting with the rosette nebula , placing it at a distance of 1.6 kpc . at this distance",
    ", the snr would have a linear diameter of roughly 110pc .",
    "analysis of the hd  47240 sightline at 12kms@xmath1 spectral resolution by @xcite found atypically low n(nai)/n(caii ) ratios for the high - velocity ( hv ) gas .",
    "this abnormal ratio was taken as evidence of dust grains being shocked and returning caii ( typically heavily depleted into grains ) to the gas phase @xcite .",
    "more recent work by @xcite utilized _ fuse _ spectra at a similar resolution , and detected absorption from many species of various ionization levels within the hv gas .",
    "absorption was seen at @xmath2kms@xmath1 for several low - ionization atomic states ( oi , ari , ni , ci , feii , and pii in _ fuse _ spectra , and oi , alii , siii , sii , feii , cii@xmath3 , mgi , and mgii in _ iue _ spectra ) .",
    "they also noted the absence of a corresponding hv component in high - ionization states ( ovi in their _ fuse _ spectrum , siiv , civ and aliii in _ iue _ spectra ) .",
    "they argued that the observed combination of ionized and neutral species could not physically coexist in the same cloud , and thus conjectured that the observed hv component is actually  several ionized and neutral gas shells expanding at slightly different velocities away from the center of the snr . \" these same _ fuse _ spectra also reveal rotationally excited ( _ _ j__=3 ) h@xmath4 at a similar high velocity @xcite , which can be produced via interstellar shocks .    in this paper , we present new multi - epoch high - resolution ( _ r _ @xmath0 230,000 ) observations of hd  47240 taken with the kitt peak national observatory coud feed telescope over an eight - year period .",
    "these data provide strong evidence that the high - velocity component associated with the monoceros loop is actually two distinct components , and that both components undergo dramatic variation in column density and central velocity over periods of a few years .",
    "the scale of these variations is determined by the combination of the proper motion of both the background star as well as the intervening gas .",
    "based on these factors , we estimate the characteristic scale of variation to be a few tens of au .",
    "observations of the interstellar nai d2 @xmath55889.951 and d1 @xmath55895.924 absorption lines were obtained toward hd  47240 ( a b1ib star located at a distance of 1.8kpc ) on five separate occasions over an approximately eight - year period ( 2006 january , 2008 march , 2009 january , 2011 february , 2014 january ) .",
    "these data were gathered using the 0.9 m coud feed telescope and spectrograph at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the spectrograph was configured using the long focal length camera ( camera 6 ) , the echelle grating , a cross - dispersing grism ( 770 ) , and the t2 kb tek2048 ccd detector . using a 150@xmath6 m slit",
    ", we achieved a 2.1 pixel spectral resolution of 0.026 , or 1.3kms@xmath1 at the nai wavelengths , as measured with a th  ar calibration lamp .",
    "we then utilized the noao iraf echelle data reduction package to correct our ccd exposures for scattered light and bias , and to flat - field our exposures . from these exposures",
    ", we then used the appropriate packages to extract spectral orders and wavelength calibrate our spectra .",
    "we also applied these techniques to a nearby early - type star ( ) whose sightline is essentially devoid of any interstellar nai absorption , allowing us to create a nightly template of telluric lines , which was used to divide out the telluric absorption in all hd  47240 spectra taken on the same night as the template .",
    "finally , we used the continuum fitting routines in the iraf package to identify the stellar continuum in the vicinity of the nai d lines , and normalized relative to this stellar continuum , leaving residual intensities due to interstellar absorption .",

    "at high resolution , it becomes clear that the strong absorption near + 70kms@xmath1 is actually two overlapping components .",
    "the values derived above provide clear evidence of dramatic variations in the nai column density associated with this gas .",
    "these variations appear to occur in several stages ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hv ] ) , beginning with an increase in _",
    "n_(nai ) of @xmath070% ( 63% and 80% for the individual variable components at @xmath14 and @xmath15kms@xmath1 , respectively ) over a two - year period between 2006 and 2008 , later followed by a @xmath055% decrease in _",
    "n_(nai ) over a similar two - year period between 2009 and 2011 .",
    "this decrease in column density is also accompanied by a velocity shift , with the velocity separation between the hv components increasing from @xmath00.6 to @xmath03.0kms@xmath1 over the same period .",
    "finally , in the three - year period between 2011 and 2014 , the column density again increased by @xmath050% , with the velocity separation further increasing to .",
    "@xcite derive line parameters for the nai components near in their data , though their observations were taken at a velocity resolution that is larger that the velocity separation between the two components observed in our data ( , corresponding to ) , and thus they treat this absorption as a single component .",
    "nonetheless , by comparing their total column density of to the sum of the two components in our data ( i.e. components 2 and 3 in table 2 ) , we see that their data is most consistent with the largest value of column density in our sample , in 2009 .",
    "overall , our column densities tend to be less than the value reported in 2001 , indicating that variation has been present in the @xmath14kms@xmath1 component(s ) since at least 2001 .",
    "the weak , broad component near @xmath16kms@xmath1 also appears to exhibit weak variation across our observations .",
    "however , the exact size and shape of this component is susceptible to the placement of the continuum fit used during our data reductions . therefore , differences in this continuum fit between spectra may manifest as apparent temporal variation across several spectra . due to this effect , we are hesitant to assign much significance to the variations in this component . @xcite",
    "derive values of and , which are consistent with the values presented in table 2 .    despite the high - resolution data discussed here ,",
    "the exact nature of this temporal variation remains unclear .",
    "an analysis of lab data @xcite and galfa data @xcite in the vicinity of hd  47240 reveals no apparent hi 21 cm emission at similar velocities to the varying hv gas , implying that the clouds responsible for this hv nai absorption are likely much smaller than the galfa beam size of @xmath04 .",
    "additionally , of the 25 sightlines studied in this region by @xcite , hd  47240 was the only one showing a component near , indicating that this is not a pervasive component in the region .",
    "@xcite argued that nai , as a trace neutral , would be biased to form on density peaks within the ism since recombination rates exhibit a strong density dependence .",
    "hence , it is possible that we are observing au - scale fluctuations in the physical conditions of the gas that cause _",
    "n_(nai ) variations not necessarily representative of similar changes in _",
    "accounting for the proper motion of hd  47240 and the expansion velocity of the intervening gas , this sightline is sampling the gas within the monoceros loop on a spatial scale of @xmath010auyr@xmath1 .    furthermore , the increasing velocity separation between the two components is indicative of gas dynamics beyond density fluctuations .",
    "these data support the conjecture by @xcite that the high - velocity gas may be several shells with slightly different expansion velocities . based on central velocities derived from our line fitting",
    ", the higher velocity component appears to accelerate by over the course of our observations , while the lower velocity component decelerates by .",
    "of particular note is that this change did not occur gradually over the eight - year period of observation .",
    "the velocity of these components stayed essentially constant over three observations from 2006 to 2009 , then changed very rapidly sometime during the approximately two - year period between our 2009 and 2011 observations , with a somewhat less dramatic change between 2011 and 2014 .",
    "the temporal variation of optical absorption has previously been reported toward the @xmath010,000-year - old vela snr , initially by both @xcite toward hd  72127a and @xcite toward hd  72089 and hd  72997 .",
    "this was later followed up more broadly by @xcite , who found evidence of nai or caii variability in 7 of 13 sightlines toward this region .",
    "@xcite then performed repeat observations toward 64 stars observed by @xcite , and found variation in the hv components for 4 of 11 sightlines in which high - velocity gas was observed . due to the @xmath7100kms@xmath1 velocities of these components , they suggest a causal connection with the expanding snr gas .",
    "while most of the reported variations are in the equivalent widths of the absorption , several of these sightlines also exhibited variation in central velocity .",
    "of particular note is the hd  72997 sightline , where @xcite found that the central velocity of the nai @xmath17 component increased by over a 14-month period between 1991 and 1993 , and @xcite noted a further between 1993 and 1996 .",
    "these velocity changes are similar in size to those observed toward hd  47240 , and occur over similar timescales .",
    "these previous studies of the vela snr show that absorption lines that vary in their central velocity are not unheard of . however , hd  47240 is still curious due to its two overlapping high - velocity components , both of which begin at a similar velocity , but appear to change their central velocity in opposite directions over the same approximately two - year time frame .",
    "two possible interpretations of this phenomenon are as follows .",
    "either we are detecting a chance alignment between two unrelated parcels of gas that both undergo sudden velocity variations in the same time frame , or there is a single physical cause for this simultaneous variation , implying that these gas parcels are linked in some way .",
    "one possible explanation for the nature of these variations is that we are detecting cold gas forming as a result of interaction between colliding gas flows , similar to the results of @xcite . in their simulations of molecular cloud formation , they observed thin sheets of cold neutral material forming at the interface between warm diffuse flows .",
    "these cold thin sheets eventually became dynamically unstable and turbulent .",
    "thus a sightline piercing such a region would simultaneously probe a cold , thin , turbulent sheet , as well as the warm , diffuse gas enveloping it . in all of our spectra of hd  47240",
    ", we detect a broad ( i.e. warm ) absorption component in addition to the narrow ( i.e. cold ) variable components .",
    "this broad component is much weaker than the variable components , as one would expect if this absorption was arising from diffuse , warm gas .",
    "if nai is biased to form on density peaks within the ism @xcite , then we may be probing the interaction regions between the expanding snr and the ambient ism .",
    "shocked gas in this interaction region could also explain the anomalous nai / caii ratios reported by @xcite .",
    "while this explanation , which suggests that the observed variations arise from a turbulent , cold sheet is feasible , we acknowledge that there are limitations to this interpretation .",
    "simulations that try to capture the dynamics of a multiphase ism @xcite generally simulate large ( 10100s of pc ) regions with a limited resolution , typically no better than @xmath00.03pc ( corresponding to @xmath06000au ) . @xcite",
    "specifically note that this resolution is `` generally insufficient for correctly resolving the structure inside the cold layer during the initial stages of the evolution . ''",
    "therefore , without a prediction for the typical size of gas structure in simulations , it is hard to say concretely if the observed fluctuations with a typical scale of 30au are consistent with the cold structures seen in simulations .",
    "the rapid , dramatic nai temporal variations observed toward the monoceros loop snr make this region ideal for further optical and ultraviolet absorption line studies .",
    "continued observations toward hd  47240 , as well as additional observations of other sightlines in the direction of the snr , will allow us to grasp the extent of the small - scale nai structure in the high - velocity remnant gas .",
    "if these observations reveal that temporal variations such as those reported in this work are common in the monoceros loop , as in the vela snr , then this may suggest a connection between snrs and small - scale nai structures .",
    "such a connection has previously been suggested by @xcite , and observations by @xcite found nai variations in 12 of 20 sightlines , with almost all of these variable sightlines being associated with known hi shells , snrs , or stellar bow shocks .",
    "a broad survey by @xcite of 104 sightlines with existing spectra from vlt - uves and the mcdonald observatory found only @xmath06% of sightlines to exhibit temporal variation , primarily in the nai d lines .",
    "these results suggest that this effect may not be pervasive , but rather localized to shell - like ism structures .",
    "however , more investigation is currently needed to understand the prevalence of au - scale nai fluctuations in the diffuse ism , as well as to understand the underlying mechanisms that give rise to these structures .",
    "we wish to thank daryl willmarth for his assistance with the kitt peak national observatory observations . this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful comments that improved this paper .",
