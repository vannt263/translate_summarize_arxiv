    "the fuelling of relativistic jets in radio - loud active galactic nuclei is still not fully understood .",
    "it is clear that energy is released in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole , but whether the mechanism is direct electromagnetic extraction of rotational kinetic energy ( e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 ; koide et al .",
    "2002 ) or more closely related to the process of accretion ( e.g. blandford & payne 1982 ; hujeirat et al .",
    "2003 ) remains a matter of debate .",
    "the ratio of energy flux in jets to that radiated by an accretion disk varies by orders of magnitude between different classes of agn . here",
    ", we are concerned with low - luminosity ( fri ) radio galaxies ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) .",
    "these are known to contain very massive black holes , but show very little evidence for emission from accretion disks , their nuclear luminosities being a small fraction of that expected from accretion at the eddington rate , @xmath1 ( marchesini , celotti , & ferrarese 2004 ) .",
    "they form the parent population for nearby bl lac objects and must therefore produce highly relativistic jets on sub - pc scales .",
    "there is direct evidence for relativistic motion on parsec scales in fri jets ( giovannini et al . , 2001 ) and",
    "for smooth deceleration from relativistic to sub - relativistic speeds on scales of 1  10kpc ( laing et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "fri radio sources are located in fairly normal elliptical galaxies , invariably containing hot , x - ray emitting plasma ( thought to confine the jets on large scales ) , but little ionized , line - emitting material at @xmath2k .",
    "it has recently become clear that they may also contain substantial amounts of cool gas and dust ( e.g. de ruiter et al .",
    "2002 ; verdoes kleijn & de zeeuw 2005 ; lim et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "dust is observed in 53% of the b2 sample of nearby radio galaxies ( mostly fri ; see below ) and the dust mass is correlated with radio power ( de ruiter et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "there is also a connection between the dust - lane morphology ( disk / irregular ) and the presence of jets , and some tendency for dust lanes and jets to be orthogonal ( de ruiter et al .",
    "2002 ; verdoes kleijn & de zeeuw 2005 ) .",
    "these associations argue that accretion of cool gas may indeed power the radio jets . the next step is to understand the dynamics of the cool gas .",
    "lim et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected @xmath3co ( 1 @xmath4 0 ) and ( 2 @xmath4 1 ) emission from the fri radio galaxies 3c31 and 264 with the iram 30 m telescope and established that the line profiles indicate disk rotation .",
    "interferometric observations of 3c31 by okuda et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the co coincides spatially with the dust disk observed by hst ( martel et al . , 1999 ) and is in ordered rotation .",
    "these authors suggest that the cool gas is in stable orbits .",
    "+ in order to increase the number of fri radio galaxies with co observations and so to improve our knowledge of their molecular gas properties , we are studying a volume - limited sample of 23 nearby ( @xmath0 ) low luminosity radio galaxies , selected from the b2 catalogue ( colla et al . , 1975 ) .",

    "we notice that @xmath51 .",
    "the fact that @xmath52 probably just reflects the different scales probed in the two cases : the whole galaxy for iras fir observations and the inner galaxy core for hst high resolution observations . on the other hand , the co observations are approximately sensitive to the same scale as hst ( @xmath53 kpc at the @xmath3co(1@xmath40 ) observing frequency ) , and a comparison is more meaningful . + our observations show several hints for a physical link between the dust component probed by hst and the molecular gas probed by co : co was detected only in those galaxies showing dust in hst images and double - horn co lines were found in two galaxies , both showing hst rotating dusty disks ( see example in fig .",

    "2003 ; leon et al . 2003 ) . to take into account the differences in volume , we limited the comparison to all objects with @xmath55 .",
    "in such range we found no significant difference : molecular gas masses are very similar , approximately spanning the range @xmath56 m@xmath57 , with upper limits varying from @xmath58 m@xmath57 to @xmath59 m@xmath57 , depending on distance . also co detection rates do not differ significantly in the three samples : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , for the ugc , 3c and b2 samples respectively .",
