    "<S> tev scale mirage mediation has been proposed as a supersymmetry breaking scheme reducing the fine tuning for electroweak symmetry breaking in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a moduli stabilization set - up for tev scale mirage mediation which allows an extra - dimensional interpretation for the origin of supersymmetry breaking and naturally gives an weak - scale size of the higgs @xmath0-parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the set - up utilizes the holomorphic gauge kinetic functions depending on both the heavy dilaton and the light volume modulus whose axion partners are assumed to be periodic fields . </S>",
