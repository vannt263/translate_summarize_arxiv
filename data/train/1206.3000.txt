    "ultrashort pulses , having a duration of a few optical cycles , have been the subject of intense study over the last years ; this is due to the fact that they find many applications in various contexts , ranging from light - matter interactions , harmonic generation , attosecond physics , nonlinear optics , and others @xcite .",
    "a theme of particular interest related to ultrashort pulses , is their evolution in nonlinear media characterized by an intensity - dependent refractive index . in that respect ,",
    "models describing ultrashort pulses in nonlinear media , as well as their systematic study , have attracted much attention ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "prominent examples are the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equation @xcite , the sine - gordon ( sg ) equation @xcite , combined mkdv - sg equations @xcite among others . note that most of these works refer to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting ; in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) one , pertinent studies are related to few - cycle solitons described by the generalized kadomtsev - petviashvilli ( kp ) equation @xcite and collapse dynamics of ultrashort spatiotemporal pulses @xcite .",
    "another model describing ultrashort pulse dynamics is the so - called _ short - pulse equation _ ( spe ) , which was first derived in the context of nonlinear fiber optics @xcite and later in the context of nonlinear metamaterials @xcite . from the physical point of view , the interest in the spe model arises from the fact that its few - cycle pulse solutions have been shown to compare more favorably to the ones of the original maxwell s equations , as compared to pertinent solutions of the more traditional nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this model is also interesting from a mathematical point of view , due to the existence of an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities @xcite , its connection to the sg model and , thus , to its complete integrability @xcite .",
    "the spe admits various types of solutions , including singular soliton solutions ",
    "the so called loop solitons @xcite  as well as other non - singular solutions , such as peakons , breather- and periodic - type waveforms @xcite . note that , recently , wave - breaking phenomena @xcite , as well as the global well - posedness question @xcite of the spe were also investigated .",
    "the above volume of work refers to the 1d setting ; to the best of our knowledge , the spe has not been considered or analyzed so far in 2d .    in this work ,",
    "we derive and study two different versions of the spe in @xmath0dimensions , namely the spe - i and spe - ii .",
    "in particular , starting from maxwell s equations , and assuming general kramers - kronig or sellmeier formulas for the permittivity and permeability ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we use a multi - scale expansion method to obtain the spe - i and spe - ii models .",
    "then , we study the general properties of each model , present the hamiltonian , lagrangian and momenta , and also obtain zero - mass constraints that are used in the simulations ( and , specifically , in the preparation of the initial data ) .",
    "next , we explore the dynamics of ultrashort pulses in 2d , employing as initial conditions , either the breather solution of the underlying 1d spe or a waveform localized in 2d ; our purpose is to investigate if ultrashort pulses are prone to transverse instabilities ( induced by the presence of diffraction in our models ) and also identify purely 2d structures that can be supported by the spe - i and spe - ii .",
    "we find that the 1d breathers are stable in the 2d setting , while 2d initial data are gradually transformed into quasi-1d waveforms , reminiscent of the 1d solutions .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the spe - i and spe - ii models .",
    "sections iii and iv are devoted to the general properties and numerical study of spe - i and spe - ii , respectively . finally , in sec .",

    "we consider the propagation of @xmath2 ( transverse - electric field propagating along the @xmath3-axis ) electromagnetic ( em ) waves in a planar metamaterial or optical waveguide structure .",
    "in particular , we consider the case where the electric and magnetic field components take the form @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the unit vectors along the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath3 directions , respectively , and we have assumed no variations ( i.e. , a homogeneous medium ) with respect to the variable @xmath10 . under these assumptions , we may use maxwell s equations ",
    "namely , ampre s and faraday s laws  take , respectively , the following form : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the @xmath10-component of the displacement vector @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the magnetic induction vector @xmath14 is connected with the magnetic field intensity @xmath15 by means of the constitutive relation @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the linear magnetic permeability ( hereafter , we use @xmath18 and @xmath19 to denote any function @xmath18 in the time- and frequency - domain , respectively ) .",
    "additionally , we assume that the considered structure exhibits a weak cubic ( kerr - type ) nonlinearity in its dielectric response .",
    "in other words , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the permittivity , @xmath22 denotes the convolution integral @xmath23 of any functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , while the nonlinear polarization @xmath26 is of the form , @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the dielectric constant of vacuum and @xmath29 is the nonlinear electric susceptibility of the medium . in the case of small - amplitude ,",

    "in conclusion , we have derived from maxwell s equations two @xmath1-dimensional short pulse equations , referred to as spe - i and spe - ii .",
    "these equations may find applications in various physical contexts where the study of ultrashort electromagnetic pulses is important ; such contexts include nonlinear metamaterials , nonlinear optical waveguide structures , nonlinear dielectric media , and others .",
    "since both spe - i and spe - ii actually generalize the @xmath107-dimensional spe @xcite , they can be used to the study of transverse ( diffraction - induced ) dynamics of ultra - short pulses in such settings .",
    "suitable assumptions on the nature of the electric and magnetic field and the form of the permittivity and permeability under which the equations can be derived were provided .",
    "we have found and presented various general properties of spe - i and spe - ii .",
    "particularly , we have identified the lagrangian and hamiltonian structure , and have used invariances to infer ( from noether s theory ) the corresponding momenta , as well as the associated zero - mass constraints ; the latter , have to be satisfied for the solutions of these equations and , thus , are also associated with the choice of the initial data used for the numerical integration of spe - i and spe - ii .",
    "we have conducted a series of numerical experiments for the 2d spes using , as initial conditions , either the 1d breather solution of the underlying 1d spes or a localized ( in 2d ) waveform  both satisfying the zero - mass constraint .",
    "our motivation was to study the stability and transverse dynamics of the most robust solutions of the 1d analogue of the system , and also examine the fate of purely 2d initial data and potentially identify structures that can be supported by the spe - i and spe - ii models .",
    "our numerical simulations have shown that the 1d breathers propagate ( even when they are initially perturbed by a small noise ) practically undistorted .",
    "an important conclusion is that these ultrashort localized structures are actually insensitive in the presence of diffraction or , in other words , they appear to be robust in the presence of ( small ) transverse perturbations for propagation distances of the order of a few hundred dimensionless units . on the other hand , simulations employing initial data localized in 2d have shown that , during evolution , the initial data gradually transforms into quasi-1d structures ( which differ between spe - i and spe - ii ) .",
    "in fact , we were not able to find any , purely 2d , nonlinear waveform that can be supported by either the spe - i or the spe - ii .",
    "the above results were obtained in the framework of the particular models , i.e. , spe - i and spe - ii , that we derived and considered in this work .",
    "it would be interesting to perform similar studies ( i.e. , transverse dynamics of 1d ultrashort pulses and localized 2d structures ) in the framework of other versions of the spe - i and spe - ii , stemming from the incorporation of higher - order effects ( as in the 1d case , in the context of the so - called regularized spe @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , still in the context of spe - i and spe - ii , it would be relevant to consider other types of solutions , e.g. , loop - type solutions or periodic waveforms composed by breathers or loops ( as in the spirit of the analysis in the 1d case  see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and others .",
    "it would also be relevant to compare the properties of the models derived herein with those of other models for ultrashort pulses including , e.g. ,  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "finally , generalizing the present models to @xmath165-dimensions , removing the assumption of spatial homogeneity along the @xmath10-direction would also constitute an interesting theme for future studies .",
