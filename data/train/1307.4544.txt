    "<S> ( [ eq : critic ] ) becomes a lower bound for the critical threshold of the algebraic transition that reads in terms of occupation probability as @xmath48 second , the way to look at the transition must be reversed : network layers are structurally independent ( i.e. , the analogous of the non percolating phase ) for values of @xmath49 , while become algebraically connected ( i.e. , analogous of the percolating phase ) when @xmath50 . + </S>",
    "<S> as it is well known , the algebraic connectivity represents a lower bound for both the edge connectivity and node connectivity of graph ( i.e. , respectively the minimal number of edges or nodes that should be removed to disconnect the graph )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the algebraic connectivity of a graph is often used as a control parameter to make the graph more resilient to random failures of its nodes or edges  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lower bound of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : perc ] ) represents also a lower bound for the critical percolation threshold measured by buldyrev _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. interestingly , our prediction turns out to be a sharp estimate of the lower bound . </S>",
    "<S> + for the erds - rnyi model , we have in fact @xmath51 , if the two networks have the same average degree @xmath52 , and this value must be compared with @xmath53 as predicted by buldyrev _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we are able to predict that @xmath54 grows as the degree distribution of the network becomes more broad  @xcite , in the same way as it has been numerically observed by buldyrev _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + although we are not able to directly map the algebraic transition to the percolation one , we believe that the existence of a first - order transition at the algebraic level represents an indirect support of the discontinuity of the percolation transition . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have provided the exact analytic treatment of the structural properties of interconnected networks . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented the exact solution for the algebraic connectivity of these network models . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we have considered the simplest case of one - to - one interdependency but our formalism can be easily extended to study more complicated dependence relationships among the nodes of the different layers . </S>",
    "<S> our proof does not rely on any approximation but on a very intuitive mathematical approach . + </S>",
    "<S> the structural phase transitions in interdependent networks are first - order in nature . </S>",
    "<S> this differentiate multi- and single - level networks in a radical manner . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the discontinuity in the first derivative of the algebraic connectivity affects directly a vast class of systems whose dynamics is driven by the minimization of energy - like functions associated to the structure of the system , but the same conclusions can be also extended to other critical phenomena whose features depend on the third , fourth , etc . </S>",
    "<S> smallest eigenpairs of the graph laplacian . </S>",
    "<S> + moreover , the point at which we observe the discontinuity in the first derivative of the algebraic connectivity ( but also on other eigenvalues of the graph laplacian ) defines a clear scale for the applicability of the results valid for isolated networks . in one case , </S>",
    "<S> network layers can be considered as independent , in the other case the entire system can be considered as a single - level network . the fact that the transition between the two regimes is so sharp leaves out only a very tiny interval of interaction values where it makes sense to consider the system as composed of many interacting network layers . + our results have also deep practical implications . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt nature of the structural transition is not only visible in the limit of infinitely large systems , but for networks of any size . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even real networked systems composed of few elements may be subjected to abrupt structural changes , including failures . </S>",
    "<S> our theory provides , however , fundamental aids for the prevention of such collapses . </S>",
    "<S> it allows , in fact , not only the prediction of the critical point of the transition , but , more importantly , to accurately design the structure of such systems in order to make them more robust . for example </S>",
    "<S> , the percolation threshold of interconnected systems can be simply decreased by increasing the algebraic connectivity of the superposition of the network layers . </S>",
    "<S> this means that an effective strategy to make an interdependent system more robust is to avoid the repetition of edges among layers , and thus bring the superposition of the layers as close as possible to an all - to - all topology .    </S>",
