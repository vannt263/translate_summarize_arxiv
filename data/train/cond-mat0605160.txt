    "externally driven systems at low enough temperature often display rate independent hysteresis .",
    "this out - of - equilibrium phenomenon occurs because intrinsic disorder creates multiple energy barriers that the system can not overcome due to the very weak thermal fluctuations .",
    "the study of zero temperature models with metastable dynamics has been very succesful for understanding rate independent hysteresis .",
    "a prototype case is the random field ising model ( rfim ) with single spin - flip relaxation dynamics @xcite .",
    "although the model is formulated in terms of magnetic variables ( external field @xmath0 and magnetization @xmath1 ) it can be applied to the study of many phenomena associated to low temperature first - order phase transitions in disordered systems , e.g. martensitic transformations @xcite , fluid adsorption in porous solids @xcite , ferroelectrics @xcite , etc .",
    "disorder is a intriguing concept : in the rfim it is introduced via independent and quenched random fields on each lattice site , gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath2 . in real materials , disorder is much more complicated and includes features at all length scales : vacancies , interstitials , composition fluctuations , dislocations , strain fields , grain boundaries , sample surfaces , edges and corners , etc .",
    "thus it is interesting to add to the rfim other sources of disorder in order to see how the non - equilibrium behaviour is modified .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the diluted rfim at @xmath3 with metastable dynamics and analyze the consequence of introducing a concentration @xmath4 of quenched vacancies .",
    "the interplay between the two kinds of disorder ( random fields and vacancies ) will be at the origin of the properties of the @xmath5 phase diagram .",
    "one of the striking results concerning the rfim with metastable dynamics , as already pointed out in the seminal paper of sethna et al.@xcite , is the occurence of a critical point when the amount of disorder @xmath2 is increased .",
    "the @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 hysteresis loops change from discontinuous ( like in a ferromagnet ) when @xmath6 to continuous ( like in a spin - glass ) when @xmath7 .",
    "this result was demonstrated using mean - field analysis and numerical simulations in 3d systems .",
    "this problem was also studied within the renormalization group formalism @xcite . moreover ,",
    "many properties of the critical point have been also studied analytically on bethe lattices @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for the occurence of such a critical point has been found in different magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "another interesting result of the rfim with metastable dynamics is that it reproduces the experimental observation that the @xmath8 trajectories of such athermal systems are discontinuous at small scales .",
    "the evolution proceeds by avalanches from a mestastable state to another . in the rfim",
    "the avalanche size distribution becomes a power - law at the critical point .",
    "experimentally , scale free distributions of avalanche properties have been found in many systems @xcite . a first attempt to study the influence of dilution in such avalanche size distributions",
    "was done some years ago @xcite .",
    "the results of this work , however , should be considered as only qualitative , given the fact that the studied system was two - dimensional , the analysis focused only on the avalanche distributions and the results concerning the phase diagram were very approximate .",
    "the order parameter that vanishes at the critical point is the size of the macroscopic discontinuity @xmath9 .",
    "the analysis of this quantity from simulations is very intrincate . in finite - size systems",
    "it is very difficult to make the distinction between a macroscopic jump and a microscopic avalanche .",
    "the measured order parameter only displays reasonable finite - size scaling ( fss ) properties when the simulated systems are very large @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite , have shown how the critical point can be characterized in systems of moderate size .",
    "the key point is to detect the so - called `` spanning '' avalanches which are the magnetization jumps that involve a set of spins that spans the whole finite system ( e.g. cubic lattice ) from one face to the opposite one . by this method avalanches in finite systems",
    "can be classified as non - spanning , 1d - spanning , 2d - spanning , or 3d - spanning .",
    "the average numbers @xmath10 , @xmath11 of 1d and 2d - spanning avalanches display a peak at a value of @xmath2 that shifts with system size @xmath12 and tends to @xmath13 when @xmath14 .",
    "the numerical data can then be scaled according to the fss hypothesis@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the exponent @xmath17 characterizes the divergence of the correlation length ( @xmath18 ) whereas @xmath19 characterizes the divergence of the number of critical avalanches .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath20 is analytic and measures the distance to the critical point .",
    "it can be fitted by the second order expression @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the behaviour of the 3d - spanning avalanches is more complex because they are of two different kinds : ( i ) critical 3d - spanning avalanches that behave like the 1d and 2d ones and ( ii ) subcritical 3d - spanning avalanches that will corespond to the @xmath9 discontinuity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the analysis is more difficult and requires a double finite - size - scaling technique .",
    "this will not be used in the present paper .",
    "instead we will focus only on the behaviour of the average numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the presence of vacancies and propose a fss hypothesis by using a bivariate scaling variable @xmath24 that allows to study the full @xmath5 diagram .    in section [ model ] , we define the model and the dynamics . in section [ numerical ] , we present results of the numerical simulations . in section [ fss ]",

    "we propose approximations to the bivariate scaling variable @xmath24 . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss the interplay between vacancies and avalanches and finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we summarize our main findings and conclude .",
    "the diluted 3d - rfim on a cubic lattice with @xmath25 sites ( @xmath26 ) is defined by the following hamiltonian ( magnetic enthalpy ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are ising spin variables , @xmath29 indicates the presence of a vacancy ( @xmath30 ) or not ( @xmath31 ) on each site , @xmath32 are quenched random fields gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath2 and @xmath0 is the driving field .",

    "the hysteresis loop is obtained by computing the magnetization @xmath40 as a function of the applied field @xmath0 .",
    "magnetization avalanches are recorded along the whole increasing field branch and their spanning properties are analyzed by using `` mask '' vectors ( as explained in ref .   ) that allow to classify them as non - spanning , 1d - spanning , 2d - spanning and 3d - spanning . in this work we shall mainly study the number of spanning avalanches of each kind which are recorded in the full upwards branch . these numbers , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath41 which depend on @xmath12 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 corresponds to averages over more than @xmath42 realizations with different random fields and random vacancy positions .",

    "in this section we try to understand why the critical line exhibits such a curvature . there must be a physical reason that goes beyond the mere effect of the dilution of the system and unstabilizes even more the phase with the ferromagnetic - like discontinuity .",

    ", we have thus identified the origin of the curvature of the critical line : when vacancies percolate the spanning avalanche propagates along the border of the percolating cluster of vacancies .",

    "this result indicates that it should be possible to find rg arguments showing that there is a unique fixed point at @xmath3 in the disorder parameter space , that includes , at least , both random fields and dilution @xcite .",
    "we have computed quadratic approximations to the scaling variable in two different zones of the phase diagram that allow for a bivariate finite - size - scaling collapse on a universal scaling function .",
