    "a remarkable discovery over the last decade is the existence of strong correlations between the masses  of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) and the overall properties of the host galaxy bulge , in particular the luminosity , stellar mass ( ) and stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ho 1999 ; gebhardt et al . 2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 , marconi & hunt 2003 , hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "there are also correlations with the narrow [ o  iii ] line width ( shields et al .",
    "2003 , boroson 2003 ) , and with the central stellar density profiles of the bulges ( graham et al .",
    "the small intrinsic scatter , especially in the correlation between  and the host s stellar velocity dispersion , mass , and luminosity , suggests that supermassive black hole growth and galaxy evolution are coupled processes . an empirical approach to understanding this coupling is to trace these correlations to earlier epochs , determining whether the tight correlations developed recently or long ago , and measuring the relative growth rates of black holes and stellar bulges .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to estimate bh masses beyond the local universe with the most robust tool ",
    "spatially resolved kinematics .",
    "also , it is very difficult to measure stellar velocity dispersions at redshifts @xmath10 in normal galaxies .",
    "the most straightforward correlation to extend to high redshifts ( @xmath11 ) is the bh mass - bulge luminosity relation .",
    "the correlation between  and galaxy luminosity , originally noted by kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) for nearby , normal galaxies , has now been explored in great detail and measured in passbands from the optical to the near infrared ( e.g. magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ho 1999 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; laor 2001 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; erwin , graham , & caon 2002 , mclure & dunlop 2002 ; bettoni et al . 2003 ; marconi & hunt 2003 , ivanov & alonso - herrero 2003 ) .",
    "these relationships are fairly tight , with a typical scatter of 0.3 - 0.45 dex in bh mass for early - type galaxies or early - type spiral galaxies that can be reliably decomposed into a bulge and a disk ( erwin , graham , & caon 2002 , bettoni et al . 2003 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "after two decades of ground - based and _ hst _ studies of quasar hosts at low ( @xmath12 ) and intermediate ( @xmath13 ) redshifts studies have found that agn hosts and normal galaxies share many of the same characteristics ( e.g. hutchings crampton , & campbell 1984 ; gehren et al .",

    "1992 ; mcleod & rieke 1994 , mcleod 1995 ; lawrence 1999 ; nelson 2000 ; wang , biermann , & wandel 2000 ) : they look alike in gross appearance .",
    "the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in galaxies suggests that most or all normal galaxies experience an agn phase at some point in their development . and",
    "this agn activity might itself have a role in regulating star formation , which would affect the development of early - type galaxies ( di matteo , springel , herquist 2005 ; ho 2005 ; somerville et al . in prep . ) .",
    "studying the bh  bulge luminosity relation at high redshift requires measuring both quantities in bright agns with comparatively faint hosts .",
    "the agn activity allows  to be estimated using the so - called virial technique ( see ho 1999 ; wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 , kaspi et al . 2000 , mclure & jarvis 2002 , vestergaard 2002 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 , kaspi et al .",
    "reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) of nearby agn provides a correlation between broad - line region ( blr ) sizes and agn continuum luminosity ( kaspi et al . 2000 , kaspi et al .",
    "combined with line widths , this virial mass can is normalized to the local  relation to provide estimates of .",
    "these have been explored in detail locally ( gebhardt et al .",

    "2005 ) and should work also at higher redshift .",
    "what is harder to measure is the luminosity of the host galaxy bulge ; agn activity and cosmological surface brightness dimming make it difficult to detect distant agn hosts , let alone measure their properties . to date , 70 orbits on _ hst _ have been used to image just 15 objects at @xmath14 in the nicmos",

    "despite this modest sample size , it is already possible to study the bh - bulge relationship , and peng et al .",
    "( 2005 , p06 hereafter ) show that these high redshift systems nearly lie on the local  versus rest - frame bulge luminosity relationship in the @xmath0-band . if the bulges at @xmath15 are fully formed and passively fading , this implies that the mean /  ratio is a factor of 3 - 6 higher at @xmath16 than today .",
    "the amount of evolution is even larger if the hosts are analogous to coeval inactive galaxies , which have lower mass - to - light ( ) ratios than at the present epoch due to their younger stellar populations ( e.g. rudnick et al .",
    "this implies that initially black holes must have grown faster than their bulges , with the bulges playing `` catch - up '' from @xmath16 to the present .",
    "indeed this evolution may still be observable in @xmath17 seyfert galaxies ( treu , malkan , & blandford 2004 ) , although the effect is smaller .",
    "the conclusions inferred from the high redshift study of p06 , however , were tentative because of the small sample size , covering two thin redshift slices with only 15 objects .",
    "several other lines of evidence suggest that the host galaxies developed more slowly at early epochs than their central black holes .",

    "( 2005 ) find similar evolution to the results of p06 by comparing _",
    "radio galaxy _ luminosities to _ quasar _ black hole masses .",
    "there are risks , however , in drawing inferences by comparing the properties of hosts and black holes in potentially different types of objects . using co lines to estimate the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath9 in high redshift quasar hosts , shields ,",
    "salviander , & bonning ( 2005 ) also find tentative evidence that the hosts are undermassive compared to their central bhs .",
    "the same conclusion is reached by merloni , rudnick , & di matteo ( 2004 ) who compared the star formation rate density and stellar mass density in the universe with accretion rates of agns .",
    "however , several other studies tell a conflicting story . using the [ o iii ] line width to approximate @xmath9 ,",
    "shields et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find little change in the  relation with redshift , albeit with a large scatter . finally , in contrast to all these studies , borys et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find that the /  ratio may be @xmath18 order of magnitude _ smaller _ in high redshift submillimeter selected galaxies than today , suggesting that bh masses must grow rapidly from @xmath14 .",
    "however , their finding is based on assuming that their low luminosity agns are _ all _ radiating at the eddington limit , which places a lower limit on the bh mass . in practice ,",
    "the eddington ratios in agns are observed to span anywhere from near 0 for normal galaxies to unity ( woo & urry 2002 ) , and there are abundant examples of gas rich galaxies that have no detectable agn .",
    "because of the complications of these other techniques , the most promising way to quantify the evolution of /  is still to measure  and the host luminosity in the same objects . to do so , however , requires a much larger sample than is currently available in the literature .",
    "here we improve on the number statistics by using gravitationally lensed host galaxies to expand our analysis to 51 objects ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zdist ] ) .",
    "gravitational lensing stretches the host galaxy out from underneath the quasar emission , preserving the surface brightness of the host but stretching and distorting its shape , leading to an enormous gain in surface brightness contrast between the host and the quasar compared to unlensed systems .",
    "the distortion of the host into an einstein ring also gives the image of the host a dramatically different morphology from that of any errors in the point spread function ( psf ) , so the photometry of the host is significantly less susceptible to systematic problems in the psf model .",

    "lensfit is a version of galfit that has been extended to fit lensed host galaxies while optimizing the mass model for the lens galaxy .",

    "the parameter uncertainties include all covariances among model parameters .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , lensing introduces no significant systematic uncertainties in the measurements of the quasar host galaxies .",
    "we model the light profiles of both the foreground lensing galaxies and the background host galaxies ( the `` source '' ) using the srsic ( 1968 ) model , @xmath36\\right).\\ ] ] the srsic profile is widely used because it reliably models galaxy light profiles and smoothly covers the range of profile shapes from exponential disks ( @xmath37 ) to de  vaucouleurs profiles ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "2002 for details ) .",
    "we use elliptical srsic profiles , so there are a total of 7 parameters : the position , the flux scale @xmath42 , the half - light radius @xmath39 , the concentration @xmath41 , the axis ratio @xmath43 and the position angle @xmath44 of the major axis . in the absence of lensing , this procedure is identical to the approach used in many studies of host galaxies ( e.g. mclure et al . 1999 , mcleod & mcleod 2001 , peng et al . 2002 , dunlop et al .",
    "2003 , snchez et al .",
    "2005 , jahnke et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "like all other studies of quasar hosts , fitting the data requires a good model for the psf .",
    "however , the details are much less important to lensed hosts than unlensed hosts , because lensed hosts are much more extended and have structures that differ dramatically from the psf . for example , small errors in the width of the psf are an enormous problem for analyzing unlensed hosts but have almost no effect on the estimated properties of a host seen as an einstein ring .",
    "this is an important advantage of using lensed hosts  even though _ hst _ produces very stable psfs , matching them to quasars is difficult because quasars and stars have different spectral shapes in the infrared .",
    "we test for psf - related problems and biases for the parameters of hosts near our detection thresholds by doing the fits using a collection of 13 high signal - to - noise images of stars .",
    "we fit each system with all psf models , presenting the results for the psf producing the best fit to the data .",
    "the one challenge of this study , and the main difference from unlensed studies , is that the apparent geometry of the host galaxy and quasar images must be reproduced by a gravitational lens model . as a problem in image fitting",
    ", this is merely an inconvenience , since all the lens does is to remap the `` unlensed '' source plane coordinates @xmath45 onto the `` lensed '' lens plane coordinate @xmath46 . on the source plane the host galaxy can again be modeled by an analytic profile @xmath47 . since gravitational lensing conserves surface brightness , the surface brightness of the lensed host is simply @xmath48 . given a model for the lens potential @xmath49 in appropriate units , the lens equation ,    @xmath50    gives the mapping from source to lens plane coordinates ( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) .",
    "the remapping requires a lens model .",
    "we outline our modeling procedure here , leaving more detailed discussion to a later study ( peng et al . in preparation ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath52 is approximately the radius of the einstein ring the lens will form , although the relation is exact only for @xmath53 ( see kochanek , keeton , & mcleod 2001 ) .",
    "the tidal shear , as its name suggests , is needed to model the tidal effects from objects near the lens or along the line of sight to the quasar ( keeton , kochanek , & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "the parameters of the lens model are adjusted as part of fitting the data .",
    "for the types of systems we consider , the geometry of the lensed images and the host galaxy constrain the parameters of the lens model quite accurately .",
    "moreover their uncertainties have little effect on the conclusions , and the lensed images are well - fit by the model",
    ". indeed , the random and systematic uncertainties of the host photometry due to psf issues are significantly larger than uncertainties due to the lens model .",
    "this , combined with the diminished importance of the character of the psf , is what give lensing its much greater sensitivity to hosts relative to direct imaging . to reassure readers unfamiliar with lens models",

    "if the mean formation redshift of the stars is lower than this redshift , then the stellar population has a lower mass - to - light ratio than in the model , so we will overestimate the mass - to - light ratio of the observed host , underestimate the amount by which the mass - to - light ratio will evolve , and hence underestimate the mass deficit @xmath95 . adopting a higher formation redshift has little effect since the fading rate only changes from @xmath97 mag for @xmath96 to @xmath98 mag for @xmath99 in the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) population synthesis models , with solar metallicity , salpeter imf , and no reddening ( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) .",

    "another lensed host , fbq  0951 + 2635 ( @xmath115 ) is well - detected and modeled , but lies 3 mag from the general trend .",
    "we include it in the fits since we lack an objective basis for rejecting it , but it does bias our fits towards fainter hosts by 0.15 mag and accounts for a third of the implied evolution of this redshift bin .",
    "six of the unlensed hosts may have biased estimates of the black hole mass due to beaming effects , contributions from narrow emission lines or broad absorption lines ( see appendix  [ app : assumptions ] ) . as a second source of scatter",
    ", the stellar populations in this redshift range may be more heterogeneous simply because the universe is older . in our high redshift bin",
    ", all stars must be @xmath116  gyr old ( at @xmath63 ) , while in this bin they can be up to @xmath117  gyr old .",
    "an increasing diversity in the average age of the stellar populations will appear as scatter .",
    "a third point is that the hosts seem to make up much of the stellar mass deficit we observed for the high redshift hosts in this lower redshift range , leading to a systematic offset between the high- and low - redshift object ends of the @xmath118 range .",
    "thus , we conclude that the -  relation also existed 810  gyr ago , but with a significantly smaller offset from the local relation than we observed in the higher redshift sample , and with a larger rms scatter ( 0.7 dex in , 1.2 mag in ) .",
    "unfortunately , with the small numbers of objects and the increased scatter among them , it is difficult to quantify this qualitative trend precisely . at most",
    ", a stellar mass deficit of a factor of two is permitted , but the statistical significance appears weak ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "other issues that could affect the results are malmquist biases , psf model problems , and the applicability of the local virial relations to high redshift systems .",
    "malmquist bias , where we detect only the most luminous hosts , can matter little because our sample is nearly complete .",
    "there is only one system out of 51 for which we are uncertain about the host detection .",
    "moreover , the effect of missing lower luminosity hosts would only increase the necessary amount of evolution because it would mean that the actual mean host luminosity is fainter than our estimates . reducing our estimate of the evolution in /",
    "means that we must be _ under - estimating _ the host galaxy luminosities by 1.5  mag , _ over - estimating _ the black hole masses by 0.6  dex ( a factor of 4 ) , or some combination of both effects .",
    "it is possible for the host luminosities to be underestimated by 0.2 - 0.3 magnitudes due to either problems in the psf models ( snchez et al .",

    "this reduction in systematic uncertainties is not offset by the need to model the lensing effects .",
    "as we discuss in the appendices  [ app : degeneracies ] , the lens model introduces no significant biases unless we assume that galaxies have no dark matter halos  an assumption leading to a host of other cosmological complications . finally , we note that the agreement of the estimated properties of lensed and unlensed host galaxies suggests that neither has major systematic problems .",
    "the conclusions in this study are sensitive to systematic shifts between the local virial calibrations for  and higher redshifts .",

    "[ fig : pg1115 ] ) .",
    "analyses of these rings show that the gravitational potentials are centered on the luminous lens galaxies and that the deviations of the potential from that of an ellipsoid are consistent with zero ( yoo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this means that the only real freedom in our model is adjusting the radial density profile of the lens , which corresponds to adjusting the mass of the dark matter halo of the lens relative to the visible galaxy .    for many lensing galaxies",
    ", the observations can not determine the exact radial density profile because of the mass sheet degeneracy .",
    "an example of this degeneracy is the fact that most of our lensing galaxies reside inside a weak galaxy cluster which acts like a uniform mass sheet at the scale of the lensed images that causes an additional , isotropic , magnification .",
    "if we take a lens and add a constant surface density sheet , @xmath150 in units of the critical density for lensing , then the only observable quantity that is altered is the time delay between the images .",
    "the effect on the properties of the host are a simple magnification ",
    "if additional surface density is added , then the scale length of the host shrinks by factor of ( @xmath151 ) and its flux drops by a factor of @xmath152 .",
    "the effect of changing the density profile of the lensing galaxy itself is a local analog of the mass sheet degeneracy . near the einstein ring where we observe the hosts , the surface density of the sie is @xmath153 while that of a typical constant mass - to - light ratio  model for the lens would be @xmath154 because the sie mass distribution is more centrally concentrated .",
    "the sie model magnifies hosts more than the constant  model , so if galaxies lacked dark matter we would underestimate their intrinsic fluxes by roughly @xmath155 or 1 magnitude . in practice , we know from studies of individual lenses ( e.g. impey et al .",

    "2006 ) , that the typical lens has a radial density distribution that is reasonably well modeled by an sie in the region where we observe the host galaxies .",
    "there is likely to be a scatter about this typical model , but it is probably at a level of 0.10.2  mag that does not represent a significant contribution to our uncertainties given the other sources of error .",
    "in our comparisons with the unlensed hosts of kukula et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and ridgway et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we find that the properties of the lensed and unlensed hosts are mutually consistent , adding empirical confirmation to this assertion .",
    "the lens modeling and the image fitting process required to simultaneously model everything seen in each image are a non - trivial challenge .",
    "the complexity of the models has some effect on our inferences about the hosts , but little effect on our conclusions , by examining the lenses shown in figures  [ fig : he1104][fig : bri0952 ] .",
    "remember that shifts in the host luminosity larger than @xmath156  mag are required to significantly affect our discussion .",
    "figures [ fig : he1104][fig : rxj0911 ] show deep ( 5 orbit ) images of he  1104@xmath541805 ( @xmath157 ) , pg  1115@xmath148080 ( @xmath56 ) , rxj  0911 + 0551 ( @xmath158 ) , and b  1600 + 434 ( @xmath58 ) , while figure  [ fig : bri0952 ] is the shallower ( 2 orbit ) image of bri  0952@xmath540115 ( @xmath149 ) . in each case , the host is readily visible after subtracting the quasar and has a spatial structure virtually impossible to mimic with psf errors or a mismodeled lens galaxy . because of our restriction on the diameter of the einstein ring ( @xmath159 ) , the quasar images and the lens galaxy are well - separated .",
    "thus , even though we must use a 7-parameter model for the lens galaxy light profile , these parameters have little covariance with those of the host . for the less well - constrained lenses , two - image lenses with less well - detected hosts",
    ", there can be degeneracies in the lens model trading off the elliptical structure of the lens and the external shear .",
    "but these are degeneracies that must hold the pattern of ray deflections fixed relative to the data , so they have negligible effects on the inferred structure of the host . empirically , the covariances between the parameters for the lens galaxy and the lens model negligibly broaden the uncertainties in the host properties",
    ".    one of our primary concerns is inferring the host parameters in shallow images where the outer regions of the host may be poorly detected .",
    "we can test for problems by comparing the host properties derived from deep 5-orbit images shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : he1104][fig : rxj0911 ] , to those derived from earlier single orbit images .",
    "both the depth of the observations and the psf have changed . for he  11041805 and pg",
    "1115 + 080 the host luminosities found from the deep images are 00.15  mag brighter and there are 10 - 20% changes in the estimated effective radii .",
    "such changes are quite comparable to the effects we find from using different model psfs . where the host is significantly fainter , as in rxj  0911 + 0511 , the upper limit on the luminosity estimate from the shallow image is 0.15  mag brighter than in the deep image .",
    "b  1600 + 434 is our most extreme example of the lens and host emission overlapping .",
    "we also require a two - component bulge+disk model for the lens and need to mask the dust lane in the disk of the lens galaxy .",
    "the difference in host luminosity between the deep and shallow images is at worst 0.25  mag , caused partly by uncertainties in the bulge - to - disk ratio of the lens galaxy ( it ranges from 0.5 to 2 ) , and partly by the lens model .",
    "for instance , if we artificially change the lens bulge size by 50% in the deep image , our estimate of the host luminosity changes by 0.3  mag .",
    "we also find that the uncertainties in the structures of the lensed hosts are markedly less than those for the unlensed hosts .",
    "presumably this is a combination of better resolving the hosts because of the magnification and distorting it into a shape that has significantly less correlation with the structure of the psf . in short ,",
    "modeling lensed hosts may appear fraught with uncertainties , but in practice we can estimate their parameters at least as well as for unlensed hosts and in some cases markedly better .",
    "several objects are problematic ( marked by embedded @xmath89 symbol or a dotted circle / square in figures [ fig : highz ] and [ fig : lowz ] ) . here",
    "we discuss the reasons for the outliers and why we have excluded some objects from our sample .    _",

    "( 2001 ) is an extremely powerful radio source ( @xmath160 to @xmath161 from 151 mhz to 37 ghz , e.g. wiren et al .",
    "1992 ; hales , baldwin & warner 1993 ) which implies such a high eddington ratio ( @xmath162 ) that the source is probably beamed towards us .",
    "if beamed emission contributes to the optical continuum , then the bh mass estimate is suspect ( see also p06 ) .    _",
    "mg  2016 + 112 _  this lensed quasar is peculiar on two grounds .",
    "first , it is a narrow line quasar ( nlq ) , and local studies of nlq ( narrow - line seyfert 1 ) find that many are radiating near the eddington limit and may be beamed ( e.g. greene & ho 2004 , bian & zhao 2004 , botte et al .",
    "2005 ) . indeed , botte et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find larger bh masses using the  technique than through the virial estimate , casting significant doubt on the reliability of bh mass estimates in nlqs .",
    "second , the extended optical emission observed in mg  2016 + 112 is also associated with lensed x - ray emission ( chartas et al .",
    "2001 ) and images of the radio jets ( koopmans et al .",
    "2002 ) , suggesting that some of the optical emission is related to extended emission from a jet rather than from the host galaxy .",
    "_ rxj  0921 + 4528 _  based on our models of the host galaxies , we have concluded that this system ( shown as a dotted circle in figure  [ fig : highz ] ) is a binary quasar rather than a gravitational lens . this was already a concern of muoz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; in our analysis we see no signs of an einstein ring structure to the host galaxies . treated as a lens , the host galaxy lies far from the general trends with an inferred mass deficit of @xmath163 , while treated as a binary it has a mass deficit of @xmath164 that is typical of the other host galaxies at its redshift .    _",
    "b  1422 + 231 _  this lensed qso is excluded because we only have an upper limit on the luminosity of the host .",
    "viewed as a marginal detection , the host luminosity is consistent with the general correlations , but we do not include it in the analysis .",
    "_ sbs  0909 + 532 _  the host galaxy images in this system merge into the emission from the lens galaxy and we lack a psf model that works well for these observations .",
    "thus we probably underestimate the host luminosity .",
    "we do not include it in the analysis .",
    "_ fbq  0951 + 2635 _  as with b  1600 + 434 , the lens is an edge on , late - type spiral galaxy that must be modeled using both a bulge and a disk .",
    "unfortunately , the system is also more compact than b  1600 + 434 , so the photometric models are less stable .",
    "problems with the photometric model are real but seem to be too small to explain the offset . for example , using a bulgeless model for the lens galaxy only increases the host luminosity by 0.4  mag , which still leaves the system 2.6 mag off the general trend .",
    "similarly ,  may be underestimated because the mg   line used to estimate it is heavily contaminated by fe line emission , but the magnitude of any potential error is too small to explain the offset .",
