    "it is expected that the upcoming accelerators operating around the tev scale will reveal some new principles in the domain of elementary particles . a frequently explored possibility in this context is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "a strong motivation for postulating this additional symmetry is that susy can stabilize the observed scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) if it is broken at or below the tev region .",
    "the masses of the new particles in a susy spectrum are thus expected to lie in this scale ( commonly called the ` susy breaking scale ' ) , although , in order to achieve a consistent scheme , the origin of susy breaking is often envisioned to lie in a higher energy range and a ` hidden ' sector .",
    "there is no evidence of susy or any other kind of physics beyond the standard model in collider experiments so far .",
    "the only strong hints of ` new physics ' , however , have been found at much lower energy scales , in the world of neutrinos .",
    "if neutrino oscillations are indeed explanations of the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles @xcite , then one is bound to have neutrino masses and mixing , which either require the presence of right - handed neutrinos or necessitate lepton - number violation ( or both , as embodied in the seesaw mechanism ) .",
    "furthermore , the mixing required in the neutrino ( or , more precisely , leptonic ) sector is of the bilarge type , with two large and one small mixing angles @xcite .",
    "this is quite different from quark mixing where one notices progressively smaller mixing as one proceeds from the first family to the second and the third .",
    "understandably , this makes one feel that some kind of physics beyond the standard model ( various theoretical possibilities have been explored in this connection @xcite ) is responsible for this difference in the neutrino ( or , more precisely , in the leptonic ) sector .",
    "if susy is indeed our key to tev - scale physics , could it also be responsible for the novel features seen in the neutrino sector ?",
    "this question has been explored in a number of ways in recent times .",
    "the two frequently discussed sources of neutrino mass generation are the seesaw mechanism and radiative effects . for the former in particular ,",
    "the scale of new physics , suppressing the relevant dimension - five operators , normally has to be at least @xmath0 gev , if neutrino masses are to have the requisite order of smallness .",
    "a natural question to ask in this context is : can we provide explanations of neutrino masses and mixing from the closest new physics scale around , such as that of susy breaking ?    the above question has already been addressed from various standpoints @xcite . in almost all of these approaches , it becomes necessary to postulate some additional physics over and above the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "however , the viability of a bilarge mixing pattern is not studied with sufficient care in many of the existing approaches .",
    "we try to address this point , using scales and symmetries that are invoked for ensuring a consistent susy breaking mechanism at the tev scale in the observable sector .",
    "the additional feature in this approach is the inclusion of a right - chiral neutrino superfield for every family , something that is inevitably required for a scheme like the seesaw mechanism .",
    "such a postulate has been been utilized earlier , where nonrenormalizable interactions involving the right - chiral neutrinos and hidden sector fields are included @xcite . as can be seen in reference @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to explain the value of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath1 , obtaining it as an artifact of the breakdown of a global symmetry ( r - symmetry ) at a scale of about @xmath2 gev .",
    "it is interesting that the same broken global symmetry can also generate neutrino masses .",
    "it was argued in reference @xcite , using such a scenario , that the special nature of neutrino mixing is due to some terms in the high - scale susy breaking scheme , including the right - chiral neutrino superfield , for which there is no analogue in the quark sector . while the viability of reproducing neutrino masses in the correct range , using the intermediate scale of susy breaking in the hidden sector , was successfully employed in earlier works @xcite , later studies took a more comprehensive approach @xcite , including radiative as well as seesaw masses , and pointing out consistent regions in the parameter space of the model answering to the bilarge mixing pattern @xcite .",
    "the relative likelihood of the different neutrino mass scenarios , namely , normal hierarchy , inverted hierarchy and degenerate neutrinos , could also be studied in this approach @xcite .    while our earlier study included @xmath3 terms , @xmath4 effects ( or lepton number violation by an odd number in general ) were left out somewhat artificially . in other words ,",
    "r - parity violating effects were neglected in such a study . however ,",
    "if lepton number is violated in nature , there is little reason _ a priori _ in the claim that it is violated by only even units and not odd ones .",
    "the possibilities that open up on inclusion of r - parity violation are investigated in this paper .",
    "r - parity , defined by @xmath5 , is a conserved quantum number in a susy theory so long as neither baryon nor lepton number is violated by an odd number . however , while the gauge and current structures of the standard model do not favour b / l violation , the situation is somewhat different in susy .",
    "most importantly , the violation of r - parity does not necessarily cause unacceptable consequences such as fast proton decay , if _ only one _ of b and l is violated , a feature that is possible in susy since baryon and lepton numbers are carried by scalars as well . an important phenomenological consequence of r - parity violation is that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is not stable anymore .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that r - parity violation through lepton number can also give rise to neutrino masses in more than one ways , both by tree - level ( seesaw type ) effects and radiative ones .",
    "based on what has been said above , we have adopted the following programme here :    * use terms in the ( nonrenormalizable ) effective lagrangian involving the mssm superfields ( including right - chiral neutrinos ) and hidden sector superfields , some of which are responsible for susy breaking , but including the possibility of lepton number violation by odd units .",
    "restrict the terms thus allowed by some high - scale quantum number ( r - charge ) .",
    "* trigger susy breaking signaled by vacuum expectation values ( vev ) acquired by the scalar as well as auxiliary components of the hidden sector fields ( whereby r - charge is broken ) .",
    "thus obtain the low - energy superpotential with broken r - parity , and also soft susy breaking terms in the scalar potential . * note that non - zero vev s for the sneutrinos can be generated by the r - parity violating term(s ) in the superpotential , presumably around the tev scale for the right - chiral ones but with much smaller values for the left - chiral ones .",
    "* using the low - energy effective lagrangian and sneutrino vev s , obtain seesaw as well as radiative masses for the light neutrinos , and generate the neutrino mass matrix . *",
    "equate terms of this mass matrix with that required by bilarge mixing , and obtain constraints on the model parameters , taking into account the conditions coming from electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "* show that numerically viable solutions exist , thus validating the very postulate that an l - violating susy effective theory with right - chiral neutrino superfields can give rise to the observed mixing pattern .",
    "the subsequent sections record different steps of this programme . in section 2",
    "we describe the salient features of the high - scale theory and the form of the low - energy lagrangian once susy is broken .",
    "section 3 specifies the requirements of bilarge neutrino mixing and generates the mass matrix answering to such mixing in our scenario .",
    "some typical numerical results are presented in section 4 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section 5 .",
    "as has been mentioned in the introduction , the scenario postulated here attempts an extension of a recent work @xcite where we explained bilarge neutrino mixing pattern starting from nonremormalizable interactions which are induced from high - scale physics .",
    "the main feature of this extension is that we now include lepton number violation by odd number of units . in the earlier study we used a global symmetry ( called r - symmetry ) ,",
    "whose purpose was to solve the @xmath1-problem @xcite and make the right - handed neutrino mass to be of order 1 tev .",
    "however , since such r - charge is not an observed quantum number in low - energy physics , one can assign it to fields differently compared to the choices in @xcite . by thus identifying an appropriate set of r - charges for both visible and hidden sector chiral superfields ,",
    "we have found terms which violate lepton number by three units .",
    "we present these r - charges and the superpotential which is induced by high - scale physics in the next subsection .",
    "the important thing to note is that the different r - charge of the right - chiral neutrino superfield @xmath6 with respect to the other quarks and leptons sets it apart in its couplings to the hidden scetor .",
    "consequently , @xmath6 in general couples to different hidden sector fields as compared to the other chiral superfields , and the forms of these couplings are also different .",
    "this not only results in a different role of @xmath6 in the superpotential but also introduces all the difference in the neutrino sector , in terms of both masses and mixing .",
    ".r - charges of hidden and visible sector superfields . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     unlike the two previous cases , we have got different @xmath7 values here .",
    "we have found that for @xmath8300 gev , @xmath7 should be at least 5 in order that equation ( 35 ) yields real solutions for @xmath9 and @xmath10 . moreover , for a @xmath11 500 gev and -500 gev , we have found that the minimum of @xmath7 should be around 1.5 and 2.5 respectively , the former of which is practicaly ruled out from the large electron positron ( lep ) collider data .",
    "we find that for large @xmath1 , the minimum allowed value of @xmath7 is sensitive to the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "this kind of feature is not there in the two previous cases .",
    "the ewsb conditions give similar constraints as in the previous two cases .",
    "in this work we have studied r - parity violating effects on neutrino masses . the special features of neutrinos are postulated to arise from nonrenormalizable interactions with hidden sector fields .",
    "proposing right - chiral majorana - like neutrino superfields and choosing specific r - charges of hidden and visible sector superfields , we could construct a term in the superpotential , which violates lepton number by three units and thus violates r - parity explicitly .",
    "comparing our model with reference @xcite , an interesting dichotomy can be observed .",
    "whereas non - vanishing of @xmath12-values have a crucial role in the previous case , they are forced to be zero here .",
    "the role has now shifted to the @xmath13 term in the superpotential , which is allowed by our r - charge assignments .",
    "it has been further argued by us that lepton number violation , distinct r - charges for the right - chiral ( s)neutrinos and special properties of the hidden sector fields they couple to  all have led together to the distinctive features of neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "after susy breaking and ewsb , neutrino masses of the right order are generated from seesaw and radiative effects , provided that the vev s of right - chiral sneutrinos are of order 1 tev .",
    "the model is also subjected to conditions arisng from ewsb .",
    "finally , we succeed in demonstrating that viable solutions exist , with the requisite mixing pattern , for each of the cases of normal hierarchy , inverted hierarchy and degenerate neutrinos . the scheme to link features of the neutrino sector to the tev scale , initiated in a previous work by us , is thus completed .      for general introductions ,",
