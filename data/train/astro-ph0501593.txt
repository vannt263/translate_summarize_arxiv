    "the flux of cosmic rays is summarized in fig.1a , b@xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum follows a broken power law .",
    "the two power laws are separated by a feature dubbed the `` knee '' ; see fig.1a .",
    "circumstantial evidence exists that cosmic rays , up to eev energy , originate in galactic supernova remnants .",
    "any association with our galaxy disappears however in the vicinity of a second feature in the spectrum referred to as the `` ankle '' . above the ankle ,",
    "the gyroradius of a proton in the galactic magnetic field exceeds the size of the galaxy and it is generally assumed that we are witnessing the onset of an extragalactic component in the spectrum that extends to energies beyond 100eev .",
    "experiments indicate that the highest energy cosmic rays are predominantly protons or , possibly , nuclei . above a threshold of 50 eev",
    "these protons interact with cosmic microwave photons and lose their energy to pions before reaching our detectors .",
    "this is the greissen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff that limits the sources to our supercluster of galaxies .",
    "models for the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays fall into two categories , top - down and bottom - up . in top - down models",
    "it is assumed that the cosmic rays are the decay products of cosmological remnants with grand unified energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "these models predict neutrino fluxes most likely within reach of first - generation telescopes such as amanda , and certainly detectable by future kilometer - scale neutrino observatories@xcite .    in bottom - up scenarios it is assumed that cosmic rays originate in cosmic accelerators",
    ". accelerating particles to tev energy and above requires massive bulk flows of relativistic charged particles .",
    "these are likely to originate from the exceptional gravitational forces in the vicinity of black holes .",
    "examples include the dense cores of exploding stars , inflows onto supermassive black holes at the centers of active galaxies and annihilating black holes or neutron stars . before leaving the source ,",
    "accelerated particles pass through intense radiation fields or dense clouds of gas surrounding the black hole .",
    "this results in interactions producing pions decaying into secondary photons and neutrinos that accompany the primary cosmic ray beam as illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "how many neutrinos are produced in association with the cosmic ray beam ?",
    "the answer to this question , among many others@xcite , provides the rationale for building kilometer - scale neutrino detectors .",
    "we first consider a neutrino beam produced at an accelerator laboratory ; see fig.2 . here",
    "the target absorbs all parent protons as well as the secondary electromagnetic and hadronic showers . only neutrinos exit the dump .",
    "if nature constructed such a `` hidden source '' in the heavens , conventional astronomy will not reveal it .",
    "it can not be the source of the cosmic rays , however , because in this case the dump must be transparent to protons .",
    "a more generic `` transparent '' source can be imagined as follows : protons are accelerated in a region of high magnetic fields where they interact with photons via the processes @xmath3 , @xmath4 . while the secondary protons may remain trapped in the acceleration region , equal numbers of neutrons , neutral and charged pions escape .",
    "the energy escaping the source is therefore equally distributed between cosmic rays , gamma rays and neutrinos produced by the decay of neutrons and neutral and charged pions , respectively . the neutrino flux from a generic transparent cosmic ray source is often referred to as the waxman - bahcall flux@xcite .",
    "it is easy to calculate and the derivation is revealing .",
    "figure 1b shows a fit to the observed spectrum above the `` ankle '' that can be used to derive the total energy in extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "the energy content of this component is @xmath5 , assuming an @xmath6 energy spectrum with a gzk cutoff .",
    "the power required for a population of sources to generate this energy density over the hubble time of @xmath7years is @xmath8 per ( mpc)@xmath9 or , as often quoted in the literature , @xmath10 per year per ( mpc)@xmath9 .",
    "this works out to@xcite    * @xmath11 per galaxy , * @xmath12 per cluster of galaxies , * @xmath13 per active galaxy , or * @xmath14erg per cosmological gamma ray burst .",
    "the coincidence between these numbers and the observed output in electromagnetic energy of these sources explains why they have emerged as the leading candidates for the cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "the coincidence is consistent with the relationship between cosmic rays and photons built into the `` transparent '' source . in the photoproduction",
    "processes roughly equal energy goes into the secondary neutrons , neutral and charged pions whose energy ends up in cosmic rays , gamma rays and neutrinos , respectively .",
    "we therefore assume that the same energy density of @xmath15 , observed in cosmic rays and electromagnetic energy , ends up in neutrinos with a spectrum @xmath16 that continues up to a maximum energy @xmath17 .",
    "the neutrino flux follows from the relation @xmath18 . for @xmath19 and @xmath20gev ,",
    "the generic source of the highest energy cosmic rays produces a flux of @xmath21 .",
    "there are several ways to modify this simple prediction :    * the derivation fails to take into account the fact that there are more cosmic rays in the universe producing neutrinos than observed at earth because of the gzk - effect and neglects evolution of the sources with redshift .",
    "this increases the neutrino flux by a factor @xmath223 , possibly more .",
    "* for proton-@xmath23 interactions muon neutrinos receive only 1/4 of the energy of the charged pion in the decay chain @xmath24 assuming that the energy is equally shared between the 4 leptons and taking into account that oscillations over cosmic distances distribute the neutrino energy equally among the 3 flavors .",
    "the corrections approximately cancel .    studying specific models of cosmic ray accelerators",
    "one finds that the energy supplied by the black hole to cosmic rays usually exceeds that transferred to pions , for instance by a factor 5 in the case of gamma ray bursts .",
    "we therefore estimate that the muon - neutrino flux associated with the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays is loosely confined to the range @xmath25 yielding @xmath26 detected muon neutrinos per km@xmath27 per year .",
    "this number depends weakly on @xmath17 and the spectral slope  @xmath23 .",
    "the observed event rate is obtained by folding the predicted flux with the probability that the neutrino is actually detected in a high energy neutrino telescope ; the latter is given by the ratio of the muon and neutrino interaction lengths in the detector medium , @xmath28@xcite .",
    "this flux has to be compared with the sensitivity of @xmath29 reached during the first 4 years of operation of the completed amanda detector in 20002003@xcite .",
    "the analysis of the data has not been completed , but a preliminary limit of @xmath30 has been obtained with a single year of data@xcite . on the other hand , after three years of operation icecube will reach a diffuse flux limit of @xmath31 .",
    "the exact value depends on the magnitude of the dominant high energy atmospheric neutrino background from the prompt decay of atmospheric charmed particles@xcite .",
    "the level of this background is difficult to anticipate .",
    "a cosmic flux at the  waxman - bahcall \" level will result in the observation of several hundred neutrinos in icecube@xcite .",
    "arguing that a generic cosmic accelerator produces equal energies in cosmic rays , photons and neutrinos , we derived the `` waxman - bahcall '' flux .",
    "a kilometer - scale detector is required to detect the roughly @xmath32 events per km@xmath27 year .",
    "model calculations assuming that active galaxies or gamma - ray bursts are the actual sources of cosmic rays yield similar , or even smaller event rates .",
    "the case for kilometer - scale detectors also emerges from the consideration of `` guaranteed '' cosmic fluxes .",
    "neutrino fluxes are guaranteed when both the accelerator and the pion producing target material can be identified .",
    "examples include :    * the extragalactic cosmic rays produce @xmath33 a few events per km@xmath27 year in interactions with cosmic microwave photons .",
    "furthermore , these cosmic rays are magnetically trapped in galaxy clusters and may produce additional neutrinos on the x - ray emitting gas in the cluster . * galactic cosmic rays",
    "interact with hydrogen in the disk producing an observable neutrino flux in a kilometer - scale detector .",
    "* air shower arrays have observed a `` directional '' flux of cosmic rays from the galactic plane , unlikely to be protons whose directions are scrambled in the magnetic field .",
    "the flux appears only in a narrow energy range from @xmath34eev , the energy where neutrons reach typical galactic kiloparsec distances within their lifetime of minutes .",
    "both the directionality and the characteristic energy make a compelling case for electrically neutral neutron primaries .",
    "for every neutron reaching earth , a calculable number decays into electron antineutrinos before reaching us .",
    "their flux should be observable in neutrino telescopes@xcite : from the cygnus region at the south pole and from the galactic center for a mediterranean detector .",
    "in conclusion , observation of `` guaranteed '' sources also requires kilometer - size neutrino detectors , preferably operated over many years .",
    "finally and most importantly , with recent observations@xcite of the supernova remnant rx j1713.7 - 3946 using the h.e.s.s . atmospheric cherenkov telescope array ,",
    "gamma - ray astronomy may have pointed at a truly guaranteed source of cosmic neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the observations of tev - gamma rays from the supernova remnant may have identified the first site where protons are accelerated to energies typical of the main component of the galactic cosmic rays@xcite .",
    "although the resolved image of the source ( the first ever at tev energies ! ) reveals tev emission from the whole supernova remnant , it shows a clear increase of the flux in the directions of known molecular clouds .",
    "this naturally suggests the possibility that protons , shock accelerated in the supernova remnant , interact with the dense clouds to produce neutral pions that are the source of the observed increase of the tev signal .",
    "furthermore , the high statistics h.e.s.s . data for the flux are power - law behaved over a large range of energies without any signature of a cutoff characteristic of synchrotron or inverse - compton sources .",
    "other interpretations are not ruled out@xcite but , fortunately , higher statistics data is forthcoming .",
    "if future data confirms that a fraction of the tev flux of rx j1713.7 - 3946 is of neutral pion origin , then the accompanying charged pions will produce a guaranteed neutrino flux of at least 20 muon - type neutrinos per kilometer - squared per year@xcite . from a variety of such sources",
    "we can therefore expect event rates of cosmic neutrinos of galactic origin similar to those estimated for extragalactic neutrinos in the previous section .",
    "supernovae associated with molecular clouds are a common feature of the ob associations that exist throughout the galactic plane .",
    "they have been suspected to be the sources of the galactic cosmic rays for some time .",
    "it is important to realize that the relation between the neutrino and gamma flux is robust@xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 neutrino flux ( @xmath36 ) produced by the decay of charged pions in the source can be derived from the observed gamma ray flux by imposing energy conservation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the minimum ( maximum ) energy of the photons that have a hadronic origin . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the corresponding minimum and maximum energy of the neutrinos .",
    "the factor @xmath42 depends on whether the @xmath43 s are of @xmath44 or @xmath45 origin .",
    "its value can be obtained from routine particle physics . in @xmath44 interactions",
    "1/3 of the proton energy goes into each pion flavor on average . in the pion - to - muon - to - electron decay chain 2 muon - neutrinos",
    "are produced with energy @xmath46 for every photon with energy @xmath47 ( on average ) .",
    "therefore the energy in neutrinos matches the energy in photons and @xmath48 .",
    "this flux has to be reduced by a factor 2 because of oscillations .",
    "the estimate should be considered a lower limit because the photon flux to which the calculation is normalized , may be partially absorbed in the source or in the interstellar medium .",
    "while it has been realized for many decades that the case for neutrino astronomy is compelling , the challenge has been to develop a reliable , expandable and affordable detector technology to build the kilometer - scale telescopes required to do the science . conceptually , the technique is simple . in the case of a high - energy muon neutrino , for instance",
    ", the neutrino interacts with a hydrogen or oxygen nucleus in deep ocean water and produces a muon travelling in nearly the same direction as the neutrino .",
    "the cerenkov light emitted along the muon s kilometer - long trajectory is detected by a lattice of photomultiplier tubes deployed on strings at depth shielded from radiation .",
    "the orientation of the cerenkov cone reveals the roughly collinear muon and neutrino direction .",
    "the amanda detector , using natural 1 mile - deep antarctic ice as a cerenkov detector , has operated for more than 4 years in its final configuration of 667 optical modules on 19 strings .",
    "the detector is in steady operation collecting roughly @xmath49 neutrinos per day using fast on - line analysis software .",
    "the lower number will yield a background - free sample all the way to the horizon .",
    "amanda s performance has been calibrated by reconstructing muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos in the 50gev to 500tev energy range@xcite .    using the first 4 years of amandaii data ,",
    "the amanda collaboration is performing a search for the emission of muon neutrinos from spatially localized directions in the northern sky . only the year",
    "2000 data have been published  @xcite .",
    "the skyplot for the 4 years of data is shown in fig.3 .",
    "a 90% upper limit on the neutrino fluency of point sources is at the level of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , averaged over declination .",
    "this corresponds to a flux of @xmath52 integrated above 10gev assuming an @xmath6 energy spectrum typical for shock acceleration of particles in high energy sources . in a search for 33 preselected sources ,",
    "the most significant excess is from the crab with 10 events where 5 are expected , not significant given the number of trials .",
    "icecube is needed to make conclusive observations of sources .",
    "there are several ways to further improve the detector s reach , for instance by including time information on the sources provided by observations at other ( photon ) wavelengths .",
    "the amandaii detector has reached a high - energy effective telescope area of 25,000@xmath5340,000m@xmath27 , depending on declination .",
    "this represents an interesting milestone : known tev gamma ray sources , such as the active galaxies markarian 501 and 421 , should be observed in neutrinos if the number of gamma rays and neutrinos emitted are roughly equal as expected from cosmic ray accelerators producing pions@xcite . therefore amanda must detect the observed tev photon sources soon , or , its observations will exclude them as the sources of cosmic rays .",
    "below pev energy , south pole neutrino telescopes do not cover the southern sky , which is obscured by the large flux of cosmic ray muons and neutrinos .",
    "this and the obvious need for more than one telescope  accelerator experiments have clearly demonstrated the value of multiple detectors  provide compelling arguments for deploying northern detectors . with the first observation of neutrinos by a detector in lake baikal with a telescope area of 2500m@xmath27 for tev muons@xcite and after extensive r&d efforts by both the antares@xcite and nestor@xcite collaborations in the mediterranean , there is optimism that the technological challenges to build neutrino telescopes in deep sea water have been met .",
    "both mediterranean collaborations have demonstrated their capability to deploy and retrieve optical sensors , and have reconstructed down - going muons with optical modules deployed for r&d tests .",
    "the antares neutrino telescope is under construction at a 2400 m deep mediterranean site off toulon , france .",
    "it will consist of 12 strings , each equipped with 75 optical sensors mounted in 25 triplets .",
    "the detector performance has been fully simulated@xcite with the following results : a sensitivity after one year to point sources of @xmath54 ( note that this is the flux of secondary muons , not neutrinos ) and to a diffuse flux of @xmath55 above 50tev . as usual ,",
    "an @xmath6 spectrum has been assumed for the signal .",
    "amandaii data have reached similar point source limits ( @xmath56 ) using 4 antarctic winters , or about 1000 days , of data@xcite ) .",
    "this value depends weakly on declination .",
    "also the diffuse limits reached in the absence of a signal are comparable@xcite .",
    "we have summarized the sensitivity of both experiments in table  1 , where they are also compared to the sensitivity of icecube .",
    "1.25em    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     given that amanda and antares operate at similar depths and have similar total photocathode area ( amandaii is actually a factor of 2 smaller with 667 8-inch versus 900 10-inch photomultipliers for antares ) , the above comparison provides us with a first glimpse at the complex question of the relative merits of water and ice as a cherenkov medium .",
    "the conclusion seems to be that , despite differences in optics and in the background counting rates of the photomultipliers , the telescope sensitivity is approximately the same for equal photocathode area .",
    "the comparison is summarized in table  1 where we have tabulated the sensitivity of amanda and antares to points sources and to a diffuse flux of neutrinos . at this time , in the absence of a discovery , it is the sensitivity and not the area or angular resolution that represents the relevant quantity of merit . in the same context , the nemo collaboration has done the interesting exercise of simulating the icecube detector ( augmented from 4800 to 5600 optical modules ; see next section ) in water rather than ice .",
    "one finds a slightly reduced sensitivity in water , probably not significant within errors and at no energy larger than 50%@xcite .",
    "notice that in several years of operation a kilometer - scale detector like icecube can improve the sensitivity of first - generation telescopes by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the baseline design of kilometer - scale neutrino detectors maximizes sensitivity to @xmath57-induced muons with energy above hundreds of gev , where the acceptance is enhanced by the increasing neutrino cross section and muon range and the earth is still largely transparent to neutrinos",
    ". the mean - free path of a @xmath57 becomes smaller than the diameter of the earth above 70tev  above this energy neutrinos can only reach the detector from angles closer to the horizon .",
    "good identification of other neutrino flavors becomes a priority , especially because @xmath58 are not absorbed by the earth .",
    "good angular resolution is required to distinguish possible point sources from background , while energy resolution is needed to enhance the signal from astrophysical sources , which are expected to have flatter energy spectra than the background atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "overall , amanda represents a proof of concept for the kilometer - scale neutrino observatory , icecube@xcite , now under construction .",
    "icecube will consist of 80 kilometer - length strings , each instrumented with 60 10-inch photomultipliers spaced by 17  m. the deepest module is 2.4  km below the surface .",
    "the strings are arranged at the apexes of equilateral triangles 125 m on a side .",
    "the instrumented ( not effective ! ) detector volume is a cubic kilometer .",
    "a surface air shower detector , icetop , consisting of 160 auger - style cherenkov detectors deployed over 1km@xmath59 above icecube , augments the deep - ice component by providing a tool for calibration , background rejection and air - shower physics , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the transmission of analogue photomultiplier signals from the deep ice to the surface , used in amanda , has been abandoned .",
    "the photomultiplier signals will be captured and digitized inside the optical module .",
    "the digitized signals are given a global time stamp with a precision of @xmath60ns and transmitted to the surface .",
    "the digital messages are sent to a string processor , a global event trigger and an event builder .",
    "construction of the detector commences in the austral summer of 2004/2005 and continues for 6 years , possibly less .",
    "the growing detector will take data during construction , with each string coming online within days of deployment .",
    "the data streams of icecube , and amandaii , embedded inside icecube , will be merged off - line using gps timestamps .",
    "icecube will offer advantages over amandaii beyond its larger size : it will have a higher efficiency and superior angular resolution in reconstructing tracks , map showers from electron- and tau - neutrinos ( events where both the production and decay of a @xmath61 produced by a @xmath62 can be identified ) and , most importantly , measure neutrino energy .",
    "simulations , benchmarked by amanda data , indicate that the direction of muons can be determined with sub - degree accuracy and their energy measured to better than 30% in the logarithm of the energy .",
    "the direction of showers will be reconstructed to better than 10@xmath63 above 10tev and the response in energy is linear and better than 20% .",
    "energy resolution is critical because , once one establishes that the energy exceeds 1pev , there is no atmospheric muon or neutrino background in a kilometer - square detector and full sky coverage of the telescope is achieved .",
    "the background counting rate of icecube signals is expected to be less than 0.5khz per optical sensor . in this low background environment",
    ", icecube can detect the excess of mev anti-@xmath64 events from a galactic supernova .",
    "nemo , an infn r&d project in italy , has been mapping mediterranean sites and studying novel mechanical structures , data transfer systems as well as low power electronics , with the goal to deploy a next - generation detector similar to icecube .",
    "a concept has been developed with 81 strings spaced by 140 m .",
    "each consists of 18 bars that are 20 m long and spaced by 40 m .",
    "a bar holds a pair of photomultipliers at each end , one looking down and one horizontally . as already mentioned",
    ", the simulated performance@xcite is , not unexpectedly , similar to that of icecube with a similar total photocathode area as the nemo concept .",
    "recently , a wide array of projects have been initiated to detect neutrinos of the highest energies , typically above a threshold of 10 eev , exploring other experimental signatures : horizontal air showers and acoustic or radio emission from neutrino - induced showers .",
    "some of these experiments , such as the radio ice cerenkov experiment@xcite and an acoustic array in the caribbean@xcite , have taken data ; others are under construction , such as the antarctic impulsive transient antenna@xcite .",
    "the more ambitious euso / owl project aims to detect the fluorescence of high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos from a detector attached to the international space stations .",
