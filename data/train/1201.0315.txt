    "among the largest deviations from predictions of the standard model ( sm ) is the discrepancy in determination of the weak mixing angle from the lep measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry of the b - quark , @xmath8 , and from the sld measurement of left - right asymmetry for hadronic final states , @xmath9 .",
    "these two measurements , showing the largest deviations from sm predictions among z - pole observables , create a very puzzling situation  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "varying sm input parameters , especially the higgs boson mass , one can fit the experimental value for one of them only at the expense of increasing the discrepancy in the other one .",
    "while @xmath8 prefers a heavy higgs boson , @xmath10 gev , @xmath9 prefers @xmath11 gev .",
    "since other observables also prefer a lighter higgs the focus has been on possible new physics effects that modify @xmath8 . however , if the pull for a large higgs mass from @xmath8 is removed , the global fit preference is in tension with lep exclusion limit , @xmath12 gev  @xcite .    in a previous study  @xcite",
    "we showed that a @xmath0 with mass close to the mass of the @xmath1 boson , with suppressed couplings to the electron compared to the z - boson , and with couplings to the b - quark , provides an excellent fit to measurements of @xmath8 on and near the @xmath1-pole , and simultaneously to @xmath9 .",
    "it also leads to a significant improvement in the total hadronic cross section on the z - pole and @xmath4 measured at energies above the @xmath1-pole .",
    "in addition , with a proper mass , the @xmath0 can explain the @xmath13 excess of @xmath14 events at lep in the @xmath15 gev region of the @xmath16 invariant mass , thus expanding the family of possible explanations of the excess that include a higgs boson with reduced coupling to the @xmath1 boson  @xcite or a sm - like higgs boson with reduced branching fraction to @xmath17  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore in detail properties of the @xmath0 needed to explain the data and present a model for @xmath0 with required couplings .",
    "we discuss signatures of the model at the large hadron collider .",
    "we calculate the @xmath7 production cross section which is the dominant production mechanism for the @xmath0 and discuss signatures of extra vector - like quarks that are predicted by the model .",
    "we consider a new vector boson , @xmath0 , associated with a new gauge symmetry @xmath18 , with couplings to the electron and the b - quark : @xmath19 in the numerical analysis we do not make any assumptions about the origin of the @xmath0 and treat all four couplings and the mass of the @xmath0 as free parameters .",
    "couplings to other sm fermions and the mixing with the @xmath1 boson are assumed to be negligible and are set to zero for simplicity .",
    "once we determine typical sizes of @xmath20 couplings required we construct a model that generates them through mixing of standard model fermions with extra vector - like fermions charged under the @xmath18 .",
    "this method of effectively generating @xmath0 couplings was recently discussed in ref .",
    "although this is not the only possible model , it is a simple one that preserves standard model yukawa couplings , it is anomaly free and can be embedded into grand unified theories .",
    "previous explanations of the deviation in @xmath8 focused on modifying @xmath21 . achieving this and simultaneously not upsetting quite precise agreement in @xmath4 turned out to be very challenging for a new physics that enters through loop corrections  @xcite .",
    "this motivated tree level modification of the @xmath21 either through mixing of b - quark with extra fermions  @xcite or through z - z mixing  @xcite .",
    "however the @xmath8 is only a part of the puzzle and any new physics that reduces to modification of bottom quark couplings can not affect the @xmath9 . in ref .  @xcite we suggested to modify the @xmath17 production cross section directly , @xmath22 , rather than modifying the @xmath1-couplings .",
    "this idea comes from a simple observation that increasing @xmath23 can decrease @xmath8 and simultaneously increase @xmath9 by a relative factor that is needed to bring them close to observed values while still improving on @xmath4 ( for more details see ref .",
    "this can be only achieved by a @xmath0 near the @xmath1-pole . to generate a sizable contribution to @xmath8 while contributing to @xmath4 only negligibly on the @xmath1-pole , and not significantly affect predictions for @xmath8 and @xmath4 above the @xmath1-pole ( that roughly agree with measurements )",
    ", the increase in @xmath23 must be due to the s - channel exchange of a new vector particle with mass close to the mass of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "a scalar particle near the @xmath1-pole can modify @xmath8 only comparably to its modification of @xmath4.-pole observables , namely a large deviation in @xmath4 ( which currently agrees with the sm prediction ) . ] a heavy particle , or a particle contributing in t - channel , can modify @xmath1-pole observables only negligibly if it should not dramatically alter predictions above the @xmath1-pole .",
    "thus a @xmath0 near the @xmath1-pole with small couplings to the electron ( in order to satisfy limits from searches for @xmath0 ) and sizable couplings to the bottom quark is the only candidate .",
    "there is extensive literature concerning models for @xmath0 and their phenomenological implications  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath0 was frequently used to explain previous discrepancies in precision electroweak data , see _",

    "we include three measurements of the asymmetry , at the peak and @xmath2 gev from the peak .",
    "these are more relevant because the presence of a @xmath0 near the @xmath1-pole changes the energy dependence of the asymmetry .",
    "in addition , about 25% of the deviation in the pole asymmetry comes from the measurement at @xmath26 gev from the peak .",

    "although we do not modify production cross sections for the charm quark and other charged leptons we nevertheless include related observables in the @xmath24 because of correlations with observables related to the bottom quark and the electron .",

    "precise definition of these observables can be found in the ewwg review  @xcite from which we also take the corresponding experimental values and correlations .",
    "while b - quark quantities were measured at three energies near the @xmath1-pole , the total hadronic cross section was measured also at @xmath48 gev ( from data collected only during 1990 - 1991 ) by four lep collaborations @xcite . because there are no combined results , we take aleph results to estimate the relative errors for each measured @xmath49 as 1.8% , 0.4% , 1.1% , 1.1% , 0.3% , 1.3% for @xmath50 gev from the peak respectively .",
