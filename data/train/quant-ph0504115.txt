    "shahriar  s.  afshar  @xcite has recently performed a variant of young s two - slit experiment , in which he claims to have demonstrated the falsification of the celebrated bohr complementarity principle , and thereby , the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics . in afshar",
    "s experiment , sketched in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , a source emits photons towards a screen with two slits marked u and l.

    "afshar notes that these images serve to provide sharp which - way information for the photons , thereby confirming their particle status .",
    "a wire grid is placed at location @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , such that the ( thin ) wires occur at precisely the theoretically predicted minima of the interference pattern due to the superposed states of the photons .",
    "afshar observes that the wire grid effectively performs a nondestructive confirmation of the superposition ; when both slits are open , no distortion or reduction in intensity of the images at @xmath9 is observed as compared to the case when the wire grid is removed .",
    "the expected distortion and reduction in intensity do occur when one of the slits is closed .",
    "this seemingly rules out the classical particle state of the photons between the locations  @xmath3 and @xmath4 when both slits are open , and confirms their wave nature , since blocking of photons by the wire grid does not occur to the classically expected extent .",
    "afshar concludes that both the sharp particle and wave natures of the photon are exhibited in a single experiment , in violation of the bohr complementarity principle .",
    "in particular , afshar  @xcite claims that the englert - greenberger duality relation  @xcite is falsified in his experiment .",
    "afshar s interpretation of his experiment has many critics ( see refs .   ) , but there is no consensus on why afshar is supposedly wrong .",
    "the most prominent of these critics seems to be kastner  @xcite , who rejects the existence of which - way information in not only the afshar experiment , but also in any classical two - slit experiment even when the wire grid is not present .",
    "kastner s argument is essentially based on a realist interpretation in which the presence of an interference pattern requires the photon to ` really ' pass through both slits .",
    "kastner concludes that post - selection of the photon in a ` which - slit ' basis does not imply that the photon passed through only one slit . in a subsequent article , kastner  @xcite",
    "cites the two - slit experiment of srikanth  @xcite as even more dramatic than the afshar experiment , in that the existence of the interference pattern is irreversibly recorded ( rather than just inferred ) and yet post - selection of the photon in a ` which - slit ' basis is possible  .",
    "the following passage from kastner  @xcite clearly reveals her realist argument :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ this is even more dramatic than the afshar result because clearly @xmath10 since a fully articulated interference pattern has been irreversibly recorded  not just indicated indirectly  and yet a measurement can be performed after the fact that seems to reveal ` which slit ' the photon went through .",
    "however , the point is that the detector s vibrational mode remains in a superposition until that measurement is made , implying that each photon indeed went through both slits . as srikanth puts",
    "it,` ... the amplitude contributions from both paths to the observation at [ detector element ] @xmath11 results in a superposition of vibrational modes .",
    "the initial superposition leaves behind a remnant superposition . '",
    "so , just because one can ` post - select ' by measuring the vibrational observable and end up with a particular corresponding slit eigenstate does nt mean the particle actually went through that slit ; in a very concrete sense , it went through both slits .",

    "other critics  @xcite of the afshar experiment agree with kastner that there is no which - way information and like kastner , argue for a realist interpretation in which the photon passed through both slits .",
    "however , a few workers  @xcite assert that while which - way information is present in the afshar experiment , visibility of the fringes is very small because the interference pattern is not actually recorded in the afshar experiment .",
    "this group rejects the inference of the existence of an interference pattern and insists that only an experimental recording of the same is acceptable .",
    "afshar s co - workers  @xcite and ohara  @xcite support the afshar interpretation that both the particle and wave properties of the photon co - exist in a real sense , thereby rejecting both the bohr complementarity principle and the englert - greenberger duality relation .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to analyze the status of the bohr complementarity principle in afshar s experiment , particularly in the light of the non - aristotelian finitary logic  ( nafl ) recently proposed by the author  @xcite .",
    "we will not concern ourselves with the nuts and bolts of afshar s experiment in an attempt to evaluate his claims from the point of view of experimental physics .",
    "instead , we consider the experiment from a purely logical angle , in the case when afshar s claims are granted as experimentally sound .",
    "it will be seen that the nafl interpretation of the quantum superposition principle does indeed uphold complementarity , _ despite _ the co - existence of the interference pattern and the path information for the photons that arrive at the image plane . indeed , we argue that the interference pattern should , in principle , be reconstructable for these photons from just the path information , without any need for the controversial grid in afshar s experiment .",
    "in fact the grid is not only logically superfluous , but also does not provide a complete reconstruction of the interference pattern , as would be possible from analysis of the path information .",
    "analysis  @xcite is critically examined and her claim that cramer s transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics  @xcite rescues the complementarity principle in afshar s experiment is disputed . what the experiments of afshar and others really establish is that any realist interpretation of quantum mechanics is highly problematic from a physical and philosophical point of view .",
    "both the bohr complementarity principle and the englert - greenberger duality relation ( at its extreme ends ) are upheld in the afshar experiment when they are properly interpreted to take into account the time dependence of logical truth , as embodied by nafl .",
    "the nafl interpretation really vindicates the original non - realist copenhagen interpretation championed by neils bohr and others , which , contrary to afshar s claims , remains unscathed by the afshar experiment .",
    "while the copenhagen interpretation formulates bohr complementarity as a physical principle , the nafl interpretation enshrines it as a sacred and inviolable logical principle which follows from basic postulates that embody finitary reasoning .",
    "this section highlights the main argument and conclusions of this paper ; the details are presented in subsequent sections . consider the modified experiment of afshar  @xcite , which was originally proposed by wheeler  @xcite and is described in sec .  5 of ref .  ,",

    "the beams overlap at some distance , where they form an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes . at the center of the dark fringes we place thin wires .    beyond the region of overlap the two beams fully separate again",
    "there , two detectors are positioned such that detector  @xmath12 detects only the photons originating from mirror  1 , and detector  @xmath13 detects only photons originating from the beam splitter ( mirror  2 ) .",
    "since the pathway of the photon is practically unobstructed , a study of the electric fields involved together with conservation of momentum allows us to uniquely identify , with high probability , the respective mirror as the place where that photon originated .",

    "the above experiment is similar in essence to the quantum eraser , the delayed - choice version of which is particularly interesting  @xcite . when the two photon beams overlap , they contain interference information and when they separate , they contain which - way information .",
    "as long as no measurements are made , the available information may be reversed as many times as one chooses .",
    "the key point here is that _ when _ the photon beams provide interference information , there is no way to extract which - way information and vice versa ; this is essentially a formulation of the bohr complementarity principle and is fully in agreement with the copenhagen interpretation .   the emphasis on ` when ' in this formulation is particularly important and contains within it a tacit time - dependence that has not been explored in full depth .",
    "the only new element in the afshar experiment is the presence of the wire grid . as in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , let the photon beams converge at a spatial location @xmath14 , where they pass through the wire grid . at location @xmath9",
    "let the photon beams hit the detectors , after which one is able to deduce both the existence of the interference pattern and the path information for the photons .",
    "we argue below that these facts do not constitute a violation of the bohr complementarity principle as claimed by afshar  @xcite .",
    "further , the wire grid is superfluous in the sense that it is not required to deduce the existence of the interference pattern ; the complete path information is sufficient for this purpose .",
    "consider a photon that passes through the wire grid at time  @xmath15 and then reaches a detector at time  @xmath16 .",
    "afshar s argument is essentially that a large number of such photons that reach the detectors at time  @xmath16 must have formed an interference pattern at time @xmath15 , because of the negligibly small number of photons that impinged on the wire grid at time  @xmath15 ( as compared to the number that reached the detectors ) .",
    "it is crucial to note that afshar is able to argue for the existence of the interference pattern for this large number of photons only _ after _ they have reached the detectors , at which point of time complete path information is also available for each of these photons .",
    "if these photon paths are superposed on to an imaginary screen at location  @xmath14 , a complete reconstruction of the interference pattern is theoretically possible , without any need for the wire grid .",
    "therefore if one accepts afshar s argument that the bohr complementarity principle is violated in his experiment , one must also accept the same conclusion from a classical version of his experiment , in which the wire grid is not present .",
    "in fact the analysis of the path information would provide a complete reconstruction of the interference pattern , whose existence is only nonconstructively deduced via the wire grid .",
    "hence the wire grid is not only logically superfluous in afshar s argument , but it also provides a less satisfactory and controversial method for deducing the existence of an interference pattern .",
    "it is extremely important to note that afshar also accepts the validity of the path information for a photon in his experiment , post its detection at time  @xmath16 .",
    "it follows that afshar has also essentially analyzed particle - like photons , each of which he accepts as having passed through only one of the slits , to arrive at his conclusion that an interference pattern existed at a previous time  @xmath15 for these photons .",
    "we may conclude that afshar s method of deducing ( or as he claims , measuring ) the existence of an interference pattern does not provide any evidence whatsoever of wave - like properties for a photon .",
    "likewise , analysis of the path information in a classical version of afshar s experiment ( without the wire grid ) would also provide a reconstruction of the interference pattern without providing any evidence whatsoever of wave - like properties for a photon .",
    "in contrast , the classical method for measuring an interference pattern , via a destruction of the photons by a screen located at @xmath14 , would eliminate any possibility of deducing path information for these photons .",
    "it is the non - availability of the path information at time @xmath15 that establishes the wave nature of the photon ( via the superposed state @xmath0 ) , whose logical consequence is the presence of an interference pattern .",
    "it is extremely important to note that the converse implication does not hold : the presence of an interference pattern does not logically imply that that the photons are in a superposed state .",
    "hence the co - existence of the interference pattern and the path information , as deduced at time @xmath16 , is not a contradiction as claimed by afshar .",
    "post the time @xmath16 , the correct interpretation of the afshar experiment ( or a classical version without the wire grid ) is that particle - like photons have a non - classical probability distribution , resulting in an interference pattern . here",
    "one must understand the time dependence involved and give up any realist notions of the superposed state @xmath0 , or the wave nature of the photon .",
    "the state @xmath0 should be thought of as merely a formalism by which we may deduce probability distributions , which are confirmed by the existence of the interference pattern .",
    "the copenhagen interpretation championed by bohr has always been non - realist in this sense . as we will see in the ensuing sections , in the ( non - realist ) nafl interpretation ,",
    "the state @xmath0 of the photons has the precise logical meaning that path information is not available ; it does _ not _ mean that a single photon ` really ' took both paths , which is a logical impossibility for a particle .",
    "secondly , the retroactive assertion of the path information at time  @xmath16 is a logical truth that _ only _ applies for times @xmath17 ; it does _ not _ mean that the path information was always available .",
    "again , one needs a non - classical , temporal logic like nafl to formulate this time - dependence , which , however , was always tacitly implied by the copenhagen interpretation . seen in this light , we know the following facts about the modified afshar experiment .",
    "firstly , at time @xmath15 , path information is not available for the photons that are passing through the wire grid ( and which will impinge on the detectors at time @xmath16 ) , and hence they are in the superposed state @xmath0 at that instant ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the interference pattern is a logical consequence of this state .",
    "secondly , at time @xmath16 , path information is retroactively available for the photons that impinged on the detectors at that instant ; however , this retroactive assertion itself only applies for times @xmath17 .",
    "the inferred presence of the interference pattern does not logically imply that the photons are in a superposed state @xmath0 ; it is this fact which permits a retroactive assertion of the path information post the time @xmath16 .",
    "a contradiction would ensue from the above two facts if one insists on ascribing reality for the superposed state @xmath0 and also insists that the retroactive assertion of the path information was always applicable ( as would be the case in classical logic ) . in the first case one would have the contradiction that the photons ` really ' took both paths _ and _ the photons took only one of the available paths ; in the second case the contradiction would be that path information is both available and not available for the said photons .",
    "kastner s realist stance  @xcite leads to these contradictions and hence forces her to reject the retroactive assertion of the path information even in the case when the wire grid is not present ( as noted in sec .",
    "[ intro ] ) .",
    "this stance contradicts well - accepted results in physics and fails to explain how a photon can ` really ' take both paths and yet exhibit particle - like behaviour at the detectors ( decoherence ) .",
    "the bohr complementarity principle is formulated in the nafl interpretation as a logical principle ( see sec .",
    "[ afsh ] ) .",

    "the temporal nature of nafl truth plays a vital role in removing the mystery associated with wave - particle duality . in classical logic , unlike nafl , the retroactive assertion of @xmath24 at @xmath32 would necessarily mean that @xmath24 was _ always true _ in the semantics of qm , including at @xmath30 .",
    "therefore in the framework of classical logic , such a retroactive assertion of @xmath24 will be problematic and will clash with the quantum superposition state that actually held in the semantics of qm at @xmath30 .    at this stage the reader will have the following obvious question ; does not @xmath55  ( definition  [ defr ] ) _ prove _ the existence of the interference pattern at location @xmath14 of fig .",

[ noinf2 ] we will argue that inference  [ inf2 ] is not permitted on logical grounds and therefore the observation @xmath55 is irrelevant to the above - noted retroactive conclusion of @xmath24 by the observer .",
    "a second question that arises is whether there are logical grounds for banning inference  [ inf1 ] as well .",
    "afshar  @xcite has asserted that inference  [ inf1 ] follows from standard optics and has subsequently pointed out elsewhere that moving one of the slits u or l in fig .",

[ qsae ] and in this subsection , nafl does not object to the metalogical existence of the photon as a particle .",
    "thus one could also take the interpretation at @xmath32 as qm*=qm+@xmath24 ( instead of qm*=qm+@xmath54 as noted above ) , if it turns out that there is indeed something wrong with inference  [ inf1 ] .",
    "we note that although the nafl interpretation does permit the retroactive assertion of @xmath24 , via inference  [ inf1 ] or otherwise , there is no _ obligation _ on the part of the observer to make such an assertion ( or measurement ) .",
    "the observer can choose to live with just the _ metamathematical _ conclusion that both classical and nonclassical models for qm exist ; he could choose to remain agnostic ( _ i.e. _ , take no stand ) on the _ metalogical _ status of the photon as a particle or non - particle in the nonclassical models and scrupulously avoid making any retroactive assertions / measurements .",
    "consequently , to facilitate such an agnostic attitude , inference  [ inf1 ] must either be disallowed or if permitted , must be weakened so as not to imply any ` reality ' for the path of the photon at time  @xmath48 . at time  @xmath16 , the photon behaves _ as though _ it originated from slit  u ( via the weakened inference  [ inf1 ] ) , but need not have ` really ' done so , from the agnostic s point of view .",
    "kastner  @xcite seems to prefer this latter approach to inference  [ inf1 ] ; however , rather than remain agnostic , she asserts that the photon passed through both slits , as a wave . in sec .",
    "[ kast ] , we criticize the limiting of inference  [ inf1 ] as noted above , as well as kastner s reasons for doing so .",
    "cramer s transactional interpretation  @xcite is also criticized from the nafl point of view in sec .",
    "an _ anti - realist _ approach is also possible in nafl .",
    "anti - realism is stronger than agnosticism , in the sense that it requires the observer to _ deny _ any reality for the state of the photon as particle or non - particle in the nonclassical model  @xmath29 . in other words ,",
    "no such reality exists in the absence of an axiomatic declaration , which , by informal convention , the observer associates with ` measurement ' in the real world .",
    "the anti - realist approach would presumably require the banning of inference  [ inf1 ] and other retroactive assertions of reality .",
    "of course , inference  [ inf2 ] is already illegal in nafl , as will be explained in sec .",
    "[ noinf2 ] .    in summary , there are three approaches possible in nafl regarding the status of the photon during @xmath57 , when @xmath29 is in force .",
    "these are , a metalogical reality for the particle state , agnosticism and anti - realism .",
    "the author believes that the first option is the most satisfactory from both philosophical and logical points of view , _ given _ definition  [ defnegp ] .",
    "with such a choice of negation in nafl , has the observer denied any possibility that the photon can ` really ' pass through both slits , thereby affirming its metalogical particle status ? this is a tricky issue ; the author believes that the answer is in the positive , i.e. , the observer has predetermined the particle nature of the photon via definition  [ defnegp ] .",
    "one may attempt to justify the above choice of negation by arguing that @xmath24 and @xmath25 can not be ` measured ' together , although @xmath26 could be ` really ' true in the real world ( this would provide another reason for banning inference  [ inf2 ] , for otherwise the proposition @xmath55 in definition  [ defr ] surely amounts to a ` measurement ' of @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , such an attempt at justification fails , for the following reason .",
    "nafl truth for undecidable propositions of a theory is purely axiomatic in nature , by the main postulate ( see sec .  [ mp ] ) ; the concept of ` measurement ' can not be formalized in the theory syntax of nafl theories  @xcite .",
    "the informal convention of associating ` axiomatic declaration ' with ` measurement ' in the real world can , in principle , be broken in nafl ; see sec .",

    "for such a proposition to be legal in the theory syntax of qm , nafl would require the negation of @xmath24 to be modified such that it includes the case of the photon passing through both slits in disjunction with the case noted in definition  [ defnegp ] .",
    "_ however _ , as a consequence , bcp will fail by the main postulate of nafl . for if both the particle and wave natures of the photon are classically possible phenomena , then the formal undecidability in qm of whether the photon exists as a particle or a wave would demand ( via proposition  [ p1 ] ) that there must exist a nonclassical model @xmath58 for qm in which the superposed state of the photon as a particle _ and _ a wave must hold . in @xmath58",

    "let the wire grid at location  @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] be replaced by an electronic screen , capable of registering and storing the arrival of single photons .",
    "the photons reach the slits one at a time , with equal probability of passing through either slit . in the standard quantum formalism , a photon is _ assumed _ to take all available paths to any particular spot on the screen at which it ends up , _",
    "i.e. _ , the photon is assumed to pass through both slits and ` interfere with itself ' , in order to theoretically predict the interference fringes . since these predictions agree with the experimental observations , the ` reality ' of the wave nature of the photon",

    "let us grant that the interference fringes are indeed observed even in the single - photon case , even though doubts have been expressed in this regard when the rate of emission of photons is sufficiently small  ( ref .",
    "; see the paragraph `` if quanta are to be treated as real particles , self - interference must be ruled out .",
    " nevertheless , this still means that the evidence in favour of self - interference is inconclusive . '' ) .",
    "firstly , note that when a single photon is fired at the slits , it also ends up as a single , bright spot at a specific , unpredictable location on the screen ; _ it does not exhibit an interference pattern on the screen_. this fact conclusively establishes the grainy nature of the photon as it interacts with the screen .",
    "the interference pattern , which is observed to build up over time only after many photons have landed on the screen , has to be interpreted as reflecting a probability distribution , with the probability density function  ( pdf ) proportional to some power of the intensity of the fringes .",
    "in particular , at the dark fringes of the screen , the photon has a vanishing pdf .",
    "note that the pdf for the photon is normalized over the entire area of the @xmath14 plane in which the screen is located .",
    "[ r1 ] a zero value of the probability density function  ( pdf ) for the photon , at a point or a line located on a dark fringe ( minimum ) of the interference pattern on the screen in young s two - slit experiment , does _ not _ imply a proof in the theory qm that a given photon can not land at that point or line and be detected .",
    "remark  [ r1 ] seems to follow even in the standard formalism for qm .",
    "note that the probability ( as opposed to the pdf ) of the photon reaching _ any _ given point or line on the screen is _ exactly _ zero ; but obviously this does not constitute a _ proof _ that the photon can not be detected at that point or line .",
    "points / lines on which the pdf vanishes , such as , the dark fringes in the two - slit experiment , are not special in this regard .",
    "arbitrarily _ small area around such a point or line will still have a non - zero probability of recording a photon , as long as the pdf does not vanish identically in the entire area .",
    "so there does not appear to be any basis for excluding the possibility that a photon can land at the minima of the fringes , although one could expect that such an eventuality is unlikely in the real world .",
    "but one should not confuse ` statistical expectation ' with ` proof ' . to be sure ,",
    "the observed intensity at the dark fringes is zero , and zero intensity means zero photon count rate . but remember that we are asking if a _",
    "single , given _ photon can land at the dark fringes ; ` count rate ' and ` intensity ' and even ` probability ' are not really well - defined for this process .",
    "for example , a very large number of photons  ( @xmath59 ) could be fired at the slits and @xmath60 of these could conform precisely to the expected probability distribution ; if the remaining photon ends up at a dark fringe , that does not constitute a violation of any law of qm .",
    "for as @xmath59 is increased and no further deviations are recorded , the probability distribution will asymptotically conform to the theoretical pattern .    at this stage",
    "one might advance the argument that a zero pdf at a point @xmath61 on the screen means that the photon passed through both slits and interfered destructively with itself at @xmath61 , making it impossible for the photon to reach @xmath61 .",
    "this argument requires the _ assumption _ that the photon is ` really ' a wave , from the slits all the way up to the screen , with the wavefunction ` collapsing ' at the screen in order to enable the detection of the photon as a particle .",
    "but such an assumption is at best an _ axiom _ that is _ not _ provable in qm .",
    "the assertion that a photon that is fired at the slits as a particle mysteriously transforms itself into a wave , passes through both slits , and equally mysteriously ends up as a particle at the screen , has no credibility when interpreted as a ` reality ' . in any case",
    "the axiomatic nature of this assertion with respect to qm means that remark  [ r1 ] still holds . for",
    "there is no proof that the same observed probability distribution can not be arrived at by other , less mysterious routes . in summary ,",
    "if one interprets the interference pattern at the screen strictly as reflecting a probability distribution for particle - like photons , and if one views the quantum formalism as merely one possible algorithm for deriving it , one can not infer any ` reality ' for the wave nature of the photon , as demonstrated by remark  [ r1 ] .",
    "young s two - slit experiment , by itself , does _ not prove _ the wave nature of the photon .",
    "one can at best assert that no photon has so far been experimentally detected at the theoretical minima of the interference pattern .",
    "but that argument does not constitute a proof of the theoretical impossibility of such a detection in _ all _ future experiments , or for all future times in a given experiment , which would be required to establish the wave nature of the photon .",
    "indeed , such an infinitary proposition can never be ` proven ' experimentally and _ must _ be axiomatic with respect to qm .",
    "of course , in the event of such an axiomatic assertion being added to qm , the wave nature of the photon ( which can then be inferred ) must be formulated as a classically possible phenomenon rather than as a contradiction of the form @xmath26 ; as observed in sec .",
    "[ afsh ] , this will require a modification of definition  [ defnegp ] , and consequently , nafl will require the violation of bcp ( definition  [ bcp ] ) via a nonclassical model @xmath58 in which the photon is neither a particle nor a wave .",

    "classically , _ any _ proposition can be inferred from a contradiction , and a proof based on such an inference has no validity . therefore the conclusion ( step  [ e ] ) can not be established as a theorem of qm based on the above ` proof ' , either in nafl or in classical logic .",
    "indeed , the wave nature of the photon is now classically impossible to prove as a theorem of qm , since it has been formulated as a contradiction .",
    "this holds in nafl as well ; a proposition of the form @xmath26 is not even legitimate in the theory syntax of the nafl theory  qm ( see sec .  [ tsps ] ) , and so can not be a theorem .",
    "further , @xmath26 can not be added as an axiom to qm , say , at time  @xmath15 , for the purpose of obtaining an interpretation qm * that retroactively asserts the wave nature of the photon , in the same manner that @xmath54 was added at time  @xmath16 ; as noted in sec .",
    "[ tsps ] , only propositions that are legitimate in the theory syntax of qm can be so added .",
    "_ however _ , it follows from proposition  [ p1 ] that consistency of qm requires the existence of a nonclassical model @xmath29 for qm in which @xmath26 is nonclassically true .",
    "the nonclassical interpretation of @xmath26 in @xmath29 was extensively discussed in secs .",
    "[ qsae ] and  [ afsh ] .",
    "the model theory tm for @xmath29 must be based on a paraconsistent logic ( see sec .  [ mp ] ) , for tm must prove @xmath26 .",
    "in such a paraconsistent logic , the classical result that _ any _ proposition follows from a contradiction does not hold . therefore steps  [ a]-[d ] in the above proof can be validly formulated in tm . rather than asserting that the photon took all available paths to the dark spot @xmath61 on the screen and destructively interfered with itself",
    ", we may simply conclude that the photon did not take any path to @xmath61 ( and indeed , is very unlikely to do so , via the proof in tm ) ; hence the dark spot .",
    "thus we have a setting in which the paraconsistent theory tm can , in principle , justify the standard quantum formalism in a nonclassical nafl model @xmath29 for qm . but note that the theorems of qm , as well as those of its interpretation qm * ( which generates @xmath29 ) , must also be theorems of tm ; the contradictions provable in tm must involve only undecidable propositions of qm * , such as , @xmath24 . in particular , since infinite sets can not exist in nafl theories  @xcite , including qm , it follows that tm can not permit these either",
    ". one must develop real analysis in nafl without infinite sets  @xcite , so that one can justify the quantum formalism in tm .",
    "one might ask , why bother with nafl at all ?",
    "why not just use a paraconsistent logic to begin with , and just develop the theory tm ?",
    "the problem is that in such an eventuality , we do not have any logical principles by which we determine which are the contradictions that should be provable in tm .",
    "for example , there would be no particular reason for bcp to hold ; without the guiding principles of nafl , a paraconsistent logic might as well prove the contradiction that the photon is both a wave and a particle at the same time .",
    "thus we would be reduced to using our arbitrary intuitions rather than the principles of logic in determining what should and should not be provable .",
    "one may think of tm as essentially a set of metamathematical rules that tell us how to combine various classical models of qm so as to generate the desired nonclassical model @xmath29 that conforms with the observer s interpretation qm * ( which in turn conforms with his observations / axiomatic declarations in the real world ) .",
    "note that tm tries to _ predict _ the results of the ` measurements ' made by the observer in the real world , via probabilistic reasoning .",
    "tm essentially tells us what qm * will probably look like if the observer keeps his axiomatic declarations in qm * in tune with his ( statistically large number of ) observations in the real world .    in summary ,",
    "our thesis is that the observed interference pattern at the screen in young s two - slit experiment is a manifestation of a _",
    "nonclassical nafl model @xmath29 for qm in which the count rate of the photon at each point of the screen is in tune with the nonclassical probability distribution derived in the theory tm of @xmath29 .",
    "there could be other nonclassical nafl models for qm that follow different probability distributions , but these may not be relevant to our real world .",
    "the important achievement here is that we have conceptually justified the use of @xmath26 in deducing the interference pattern _ without conceding any physical reality _ for the wave nature of the photon . as noted earlier , @xmath26 in @xmath29 merely reflects the observer s ignorance of the path information of the photon and",
    "is used _ only _ for the purpose of deriving the probability distribution ; the contradictions in the paraconsistent structure @xmath29 have no ` physical ' reality . to the various bright spots on the screen , each individual photon ` really ' takes only one path .",
    "the only mystery here is that this ` reality ' is not revealed via a classical probability distribution when a large number of photons are fired at the screen ; instead , the resulting interference pattern revealed by nature seems to indirectly confirm , via a nonclassical probability distribution , the observer s ignorance of the path information . why does nature act in this manner ?",
    "the answer may have something to do with the paradoxical nature of probability , which is , even classically , a problematic notion that is dependent on the information available to the observer ( hence , ` conditional ' probabilities ) .",
    "while the photon passes through only one slit at a time as a particle , the status of the other inactive slit ( _ i.e. _ , whether it is open or closed ) seems to impose some sort of conditionality on the probability distribution .",
    "perhaps formulation of real analysis in nafl , development of consistent postulates for qm , and then developing the paraconsistent theory tm of @xmath29 will shed further light on this mystery .",
    "many of the concepts of standard quantum theory , such as , the notion of probability , will not be formalizable in the nafl theory qm and will have to be dealt with in tm , and in general , at a metamathematical level .",
    "this is understandable , since these concepts may be specific to the real world and the model @xmath29 which applies to it .",
    "it is also possible that radically new concepts of space , time , and in particular , light , may be needed for a more satisfactory description of nature in a nafl theory that does away with probability altogether .",
    "let us now revert to afshar s experiment .",
    "afshar  @xcite argues that if a classical probability distribution had applied , the wire grid at location  @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] should have blocked about 6.6% of the photons .",
    "instead , the wire grid blocked fewer than 0.1% of the photons , as expected from the probability distribution calculated using the standard quantum formalism .",

    "as argued above , this does not legitimize inference  [ inf2 ] . in the light of the observation of @xmath54 and inference  [ inf1 ] ,",
    "one concludes that the photon still has a metalogical particle nature for @xmath57 , but with a nonclassical probability distribution corresponding to the interference pattern , as deducible in a nonclassical model @xmath29 for qm .",
    "in particular , there was no ` destructive interference ' at the dark fringes corresponding to the locations of the wires ; the photons that ended up at the images simply missed the wires and the dark fringes .",
    "note that the axiomatic nature of nafl truth allows the observer to _ axiomatically declare _ , via a choice of qm*=qm+@xmath24 at time  @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , that a given photon passed through slit  u , even though such a _ measurement _ was not made at @xmath30 .",
    "thus the observer breaks with the informal convention of keeping his axiomatic declarations in tune with his measurements , and generates a classical particle model of the photon for @xmath57 , instead of the nonclassical model @xmath29 . if at @xmath32",
    ", the photon is found to end up at the image @xmath1 , this would vindicate the observer s choice made through guesswork and free will .",
    "thus in principle , nafl allows the observer to bring the particle nature of the photon within the scope of its semantics , even though in practice , continued success on this front would require improbable guesswork on the part of the observer .",
    "of course , consistency of qm requires @xmath29 to exist ( see proposition  [ p1 ] ) , even if the observer does not choose it in any particular instance .",
    "kastner  @xcite has criticized the interpretation of inference  [ inf1 ] as retroactively asserting the particle nature of the photon .",

    "so , as was noted in sec .",
    "[ afsh ] , kastner requires inference  [ inf1 ] to be limited to the assertion that the photon was post - selected in the state of slit  u , without any retroactive implication that the photon ` really ' passed through only slit  u ( as a particle ) . in other words , inference  [ inf1 ] does not provide ` which - way information ' for the photon . *",
    "kastner cites cramer s transactional interpretation  ( ti ) of quantum mechanics  @xcite as unambiguously showing that the photon was selected in the superposed state of both slits at time  @xmath48 , and also was post - selected in the state of slit  u at time  @xmath16 . however , there are intermediate times in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , when the photon was between the locations @xmath14 and @xmath9 , during which the ontological state of the photon is ambiguous according to ti ( see fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "kastner states that at these locations , the ` offer wave ' of ti shows the photon to be in a superposition state of both slits , while the backwards - in - time ` confirmation wave ' of ti shows the photon to be in a state of slit  u. for this reason , kastner asserts that it would be wrong to retroactively infer at time  @xmath16 that the photon passed through only slit  u , since such an inference would require the photon to be determinately a particle at all intermediate locations between @xmath3 and @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .    on the basis of the above criticisms",
    ", kastner concludes that afshar s experiment does not refute bcp  ( definition  [ bcp ] ) .",
    "we have exhaustively addressed the problems with the first of kastner s criticisms . from the point of view of nafl ,",
    "inference  [ inf1 ] is merely the observer s retroactive axiomatic declaration of the particle nature of the photon .",
    "but the concept of ` axiomatic declaration ' itself can not be formalized in the theory syntax of nafl theories  @xcite .",
    "so when the observer ` post - selects ' the photon as being in the ` state of slit  u ' , he can _ only _ have in mind that the photon ` really ' passed through slit  u as a particle . therefore , in nafl , the classical model of qm that is generated at time  @xmath16 via the observer s interpretation qm*=qm+@xmath54 , _ must _ reflect such a retroactive implication for inference  [ inf1 ] .",
    "in fact , the completeness theorem of first - order logic ( which is a metamathematical principle in nafl ) _ requires _ that there _ must _ exist such a classical model for qm . for , as we have already pointed out , qm does not prove either @xmath25 or kastner s claim that the photon passed through both slits at time  @xmath48 .",
    "this latter claim , affirming the wave nature of the photon at time  @xmath48 , is at best another _ metamathematical _ requirement that kastner chooses to impose . in the conflict between these two metamathematical requirements",
    ", the completeness theorem wins out in nafl ; it is a sacred principle of logic that can not be sacrificed . on the other hand , the nonclassical nafl model @xmath29 of qm that affirms @xmath26 at time  @xmath48 does not conflict with the above retroactive assertion of @xmath24 , either temporally or in meaning , as we have already pointed out in secs .",
    "[ qsae ]  and  [ afsh ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 only affirms the observer s lack of information on the path of the photon at time  @xmath48 , rather than kastner s assertion that the photon ` really ' passed through both slits .",
    "the second of kastner s objections is also problematic , in the sense that her stated purpose of rescuing bcp is not served by her invocation of cramer s ti .",
    "if ti requires that the photon s ontological state is ambiguous between the locations @xmath14 and @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , that amounts to a violation of bcp when the photon was at these locations .",
    "for we have determined , using ti , that the photon was neither a particle nor a wave when it was at these locations .",
    "so the nafl model of qm that applies at these times would have to be a superposition of both the particle and wave states of the photon , _",
    "i.e. _ , a superposition of a classical and a nonclassical model of qm .",
    "but such a superposition of models does not exist in nafl and clearly violates bcp ; see definition  [ bcp ] and also the nafl version of bcp as stated at the end of sec .",
    "this is not surprising , for ti requires us to ascribe reality to the superposed state of the photon passing through both slits ; this is also kastner s belief , as noted above . as a consequence , nafl would _",
    "require _ that definition  [ defnegp ] be modified to force , via proposition  [ p1 ] , the existence of a nonclassical model  @xmath58 for qm that violates bcp ( as was pointed out in sec .",
    "[ afsh ] ) .",
    "one example of a quantum mystery arises from the well - known delayed choice experiment of wheeler  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , _ after _ a photon passes through the slit(s ) in the @xmath3 plane at time  @xmath48 , the observer could either choose to insert a screen in the @xmath14 plane , _ or _ he could choose to allow the photon to pass through the lens and reach the @xmath9 plane .",
    "so according to wheeler , this delayed choice of measurement means that the observer could post - select ( _ i.e. , after _",
    "time  @xmath48 ) each photon to pass through both slits , as a wave , or one slit only , as a particle . but",
    "this amounts to choosing one s past after the event and seems paradoxical . in the nafl interpretation",
    ", the metalogical reality of the photons as particles means that the delayed choice does _ not _ influence the past ; each photon always passed through one and only one slit .",
    "the interference pattern , which one sees on the screen after many photons are recorded on it , _ also _ exists ( but is not measured ) for the photons that end up at the @xmath9 plane , as is spectacularly confirmed in afshar s experiment .",
    "cramer s transactional interpretation  ( ti )  @xcite , on the other hand , provides an explanation for delayed choice by positing an ` atemporal ' transaction that takes place between ` offer waves ' and ` confirmation waves ' , with the latter propagating backwards in time . from the point of view of nafl",
    ", however , which rejects the relativistic conception of ` spacetime ' ( see appendix  b of ref .  ) , such an atemporal transaction is not physically possible , and neither can anything propagate backwards in time .",
    "the temporal and axiomatic nature of nafl truth requires absolute time , as well as euclidean space .",
    "cramer s aphysical approach to delayed choice really amounts to taking an anti - realist stand that the ` past ' exists if and only if , and only _ after _ , it is clearly defined .",
    "this is confirmed by cramer s assertion that `` no offer is a transaction until it is a confirmed transaction '' , which corresponds to wheeler s `` no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon '' .",
    "such an anti - realist stand is possible in nafl by associating ` measurement ' or ` observation ' with ` axiomatic declaration ' , and denying any metalogical reality outside of nafl syntax and semantics ( as was noted in sec .",
    "[ afsh ] ) .",
    "but in nafl , the superposed state is not really a physical state of the photon passing through both slits , as is assumed by cramer ; the anti - realist stand , when imposed upon the nafl interpretation , would further require that the photon has no determinate state in the real world when it is deemed to be in a quantum superposition of passing through both slits . hence from the point of view of nafl , cramer s ti is not consistent with either realism or anti - realism . as was discussed in sec .",
    "[ afsh ] , positing a metalogical reality for the particle nature of the photon is not only compatible with nafl , but is also philosophically a more satisfactory resolution of the paradoxes associated with afshar s experiment . from this realist point of view",
    ", cramer s ti , by positing waves propagating backwards in time , seems to accept that one _ can _ influence the past ; this is denied in the nafl interpretation as aphysical . in sec .",
    "[ kast ] , we have criticized kastner s  @xcite defence of bcp , using cramer s ti , as logically problematic ; the said defense upholds bcp at the slits by requiring its violation elsewhere , at least according to the nafl interpretation .",
    "consider the coin toss experiment described in sec .",
    "2.5 of ref .  .",
    "an observer tosses a fair coin and , as it lands at time  @xmath48 , covers the coin under the palm of his hand without seeing the outcome .",
    "let @xmath24  ( @xmath25 ) represent `` the outcome is ` heads '  ( ` tails ' ) '' .",
    "let the observer have the nafl theory t in mind , which includes definitions describing this coin toss experiment .",
    "further , at @xmath32 , the observer lifts his hand and sees the outcome , say , ` heads ' . for @xmath57 , the observer chooses the interpretation t*=t .",
    "hence @xmath26 holds for the observer in a nonclassical model @xmath62 for t , signifying that he has not measured  ( axiomatically declared ) the outcome to be either ` heads ' or ` tails ' during this time interval .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the proposition that `` the outcome is ` heads ' for @xmath17 '' . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the observer takes t*=t+@xmath55 , in tune with his observation , so that @xmath24 ( which is provable in t * for these times ) holds in a classical model for t. let the proposition @xmath54 , formulated for @xmath17 , denote `` the outcome was ` heads ' during @xmath57 '' .",
    "our contention is that the theory t*=t+@xmath55 proves @xmath54 , so that the observer has retroactively asserted at @xmath32 that the outcome was always ` heads ' during @xmath57 .",
    "is the inference of @xmath54 in t+@xmath55 legal ? in this case ,",
    "the observer can feel confident that the outcome ` heads ' must be metalogically  ( ` really ' ) true for @xmath57 .",
    "the observer _ knew _ that the coin was flat under the palm of his hands during @xmath57 , but as was noted in sec .",
    "2.5 of ref .  ,",
    "this fact , being provably equivalent to @xmath27 in the proof syntax of t , _ can not _ be formalized as a legal proposition in the theory syntax of t. such an ( illegal ) formalization would force @xmath27 to be a theorem of t , and prevent the existence of the nonclassical model @xmath62 required by proposition  [ p1 ] for consistency of t in nafl .",
    "the reason this example is interesting is that the observer _ knows _ that the superposed state of ` heads and tails ' in @xmath62 has no ` physical ' reality , but nevertheless it correctly reflects the observer s ignorance of the outcome during @xmath57 . in afshar",
    "s experiment , the situation is logically similar , but the observer does not have such a clear intuition for the particle nature of the photon , and consequently , for the validity of inference  [ inf1 ] .",
    "but nevertheless , nafl treats both cases similarly and in a logically consistent manner .",
    "next reconsider the schrdinger cat experiment described in sec .",
    "once again the observer has the intuition that the retroactive assertion of @xmath35 , via an inference in the theory qm*=qm+@xmath19 , is true in the real world .",
    "this inference is based on the principle ( deducible in the proof syntax of qm * ) that if one finds the cat to be alive at time  @xmath16 and if one knows that the cat was alive at an earlier time  @xmath48 , then the cat was alive for @xmath33 .",
    "thus at @xmath32 , we _ know _ that the cat was ( metalogically , ` really ' and unambiguously ) alive during @xmath33 .",
    "nafl supports such a rock - solid , unimpeachable inference that conforms with the standard definition of ` alive ' .",
    "the nafl interpretation upholds the bohr complementarity principle  ( bcp ) in afshar s experiment  @xcite by retroactively affirming the ` real ' particle status of the photon , even while _ semantically _ the photon was in a superposed state  ( @xmath0 ) in a nonclassical model @xmath29 of the nafl theory  qm formalizing quantum mechanics .",
    "however , such a ` reality ' for the particle state , which is outside of both the syntax and the semantics of qm , can be said to be _",
    "metalogical_. in nafl , @xmath0 ( or the ` wave nature ' of the photon ) only reflects the fact that the observer has not measured ( axiomatically asserted ) the true , classical path of the photon ; no _ physical _ reality , to the effect that the photon ` really passed though both slits and interfered with itself ' , can be assigned to @xmath0 .",
    "the interference pattern in the @xmath14 plane of fig .  [ f1 ] must be interpreted in nafl as reflecting a nonclassical probability distribution for the photons , still treated as particles , that is derivable within @xmath29 .",
    "we have no explanation yet for _ why _ the lack of which - way information influences the probability distribution in this manner .",
    "the still nascent nafl interpretation of quantum mechanics has considerable potential for future research .",
    "the subtle formulation of the syntax and semantics of nafl theories to combine both classical and intuitionistic principles , the ability of nafl to handle the temporal nature of mathematical truth , and the demonstration of the need for a paraconsistent logic to handle the model theory of nafl theories are features that make the nafl interpretation highly suitable for the purpose of providing a logical explanation for the mysteries of quantum mechanics , _ within the framework of a single logic_. this , despite the limitations that nafl imposes on classical infinitary reasoning  @xcite , is a great advantage of the nafl interpretation , which can be said to provide a logical basis for many of niels  bohr s great physical ideas that were spelt out in the copenhagen interpretation .",
    "it is to be emphasized the nafl interpretation is not _ essential _ for the purpose of explaining the results of the afshar experiment and other seemingly paradoxical experiments of quantum mechanics ; the copenhagen interpretation is adequate for this purpose .",
    "however , at present quantum mechanics can not be satisfactorily formalized within a single logic . for example",
    ", real analysis uses the framework of classical logic while other quantum phenomena like superposition require nonclassical logics .",
    "if the nafl interpretation can be developed to its full potential , a formalization of all of quantum mechanics within a single logic would hopefully be within reach .",
