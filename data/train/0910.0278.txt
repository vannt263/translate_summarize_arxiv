    "be stars are a class of non - supergiant b - type stars with balmer and other line emission features due to an equatorial decretion disk .",
    "the disk is likely the result of a combination of the star s rapid rotation ( near the critical limit ) and non - radial pulsations ( nrps ; porter & rivinius 2003 ) .",
    "nrps are spherical harmonic waves traversing the surface of a star . these pulsations can be found in multiple frequencies on the surface simultaneously ( rivinius , baade , & stefl 2003 ) .",
    "there are two primary classes of nrp modes : @xmath2- and @xmath3-modes .",
    "@xmath2-modes are described by a low frequency pulsation that has gravity as its restoring force .",
    "the dominant oscillation in this mode is transverse across the surface .",
    "@xmath3-modes are dominated by high frequency , radial oscillations with a pressure restoring force ( de ridder 2001 ) .",
    "these modes in main - sequence , pulsating b stars are driven by the @xmath4 mechanism ( gutirrez - soto et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "temperature and flux gradients are established between the dimmer , cooler material on the peaks of the pulsations and the brighter , warmer material in the troughs .",
    "the flux variations over the stellar surface are then observed as either ripples within photospheric absorption line profiles or as periodic variations in magnitude . a large",
    ", high - resolution spectroscopic study would reveal both the degree , @xmath0 , and the azimuthal order , @xmath1 , but such studies are challenging due to the need for large amounts of time on a large telescope .",

    "assuming slowly rotating stars , the non - radial pulsations can be modeled by spherical harmonic perturbations of a spherical stellar surface , given by buta & smith ( 1979 ) as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fractional change in radius , @xmath19 is the amplitude associated with spherical harmonic @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the frequency of the mode .",
