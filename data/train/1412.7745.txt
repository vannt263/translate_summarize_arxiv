    "one of the simplest extensions of the standard model is the addition of a second higgs doublet to its spectrum .",
    "a second higgs doublet appears naturally in a variety of well motivated scenarios that go beyond the standard model .",
    "these include supersymmetric models @xcite , left - right symmetric models @xcite , axion models @xcite and models of spontaneous cp violation @xcite , to name a few .",
    "these models have the potential for rich phenomenology that may be subject to tests at colliders and in low energy experiments .",
    "a notable feature of these models is the presence of additional scalar states , two neutral and one charged , which may be accessible experimentally at the lhc .",
    "naturally , two higgs doublet models have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on certain cosmological and astrophysical aspects of the two higgs doublet models in a regime that has not been previously considered .",
    "it is well known that no particle in the standard model can fit the observed properties of the dark matter in the universe inferred from astrophysical and cosmological data .",
    "new particles are postulated to fulfill this role .",
    "two higgs doublet models do contain a candidate for dark matter in one of its neutral scalar bosons .",
    "it is generally assumed that this particle , which is stable on cosmological time scales owing to an approximate ( or exact ) symmetry , is a _ cold _ dark matter candidate with masses in the several 100 gev range@xcite .",
    "these particles annihilates into lighter standard model particles in the early thermal history of the universe with cross sections of order picobarn . in this paper",
    "we show that there is an alternative possibility where the extra neutral scalar boson of these models can have mass of the order of a kev and be identified as a _",
    "warm _ dark matter candidate .",
    "this scenario is completely consistent with known observations and would have distinct signatures at colliders as well as in cosmology and astrophysics , which we outline here .",
    "the @xmath10cdm cosmological paradigm , which assumes a significant cold dark matter component along with a dark energy component in the energy density of the universe , has been immensely successful in confronting cosmological and astrophysical data over a wide range of distance scales , of order gpc to about 10 mpc",
    ". however , at distance scales below a mpc , cold dark matter , which has negligible free  streaming velocity , appears to show some inconsistencies .",
    "there is a shortage in the number of galactic satellites observed compared to cdm @xmath1body simulations ; density profiles of galactic dark matter haloes are too centrally concentrated in simulations compared to data ; and the central density profile of dwarf galaxies are observed to be shallower than predicted by cdm @xcite .",
    "these problems can be remedied if the dark matter is _ warm _",
    "@xcite , rather than cold .",
    "warm dark matter ( wdm ) has non - negligible free  streaming velocity , and is able to wipe out structures at distance scales below a mpc , while behaving very much like cdm at larger distance scales .",
    "this would alleviate the small scale problems of cdm , while preserving its success at larger distance scales .",
    "the free streaming length of warm dark matter can be written down very roughly as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dark matter mass and @xmath13 its average momentum . for a fully thermalized wdm , @xmath14 . in the wdm of two higgs doublet model , as we shall see later , @xmath15 , so that an effective thermal mass of @xmath0 , about six times larger than @xmath12 can be defined corresponding to fully thermalizd momentum distribution . for @xmath12 of order few kev",
    ", we see that the free  streaming length is of order mpc , as required for solving the cdm small scale problems .",
    "note that structures at larger scales would not be significantly effected , and thus wdm scenario would preserve the success of cdm at large scales .",
    "the wdm candidate of two higgs doublet extensions of the standard model is a neutral scalar , @xmath0 , which can have a mass of order kev .",
    "such a particle , which remains in thermal equilibrium in the early universe down to temperatures of order 150 mev through weak interaction processes ( see below ) , would contribute too much to the energy density of the universe , by about a factor of 34 ( for @xmath16 kev ) .",
    "this unpleasant situation is remedied by the late decay of a particle that dumps entropy into other species and heats up the photons relative to @xmath0 .",
    "a natural candidate for such a late decay is a right - handed neutrino @xmath1 that takes part in neutrino mass generation via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "we find that for @xmath17 , and @xmath18 sec .",
    "for the mass and lifetime of @xmath1 , consistency with dark matter abundance can be realized .",
    "novel signals for collider experiments as well as for cosmology and astrophysics for this scenario are outlined . in particular , by introducing a tiny breaking of a @xmath19 symmetry that acts on the second higgs doublet and makes the dark matter stable , the decay @xmath5 can occur with a lifetime longer than the age of the universe .",
    "this can explain the recently reported anomaly in the @xmath4-ray spectrum from extra - galactic sources , if @xmath20 kev is adopted , which is compatible with other wdm requirements .",
    "this feature is somewhat analogous to the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite where a sm singlet scalar which coupled very feably with the sm sector played the role of the 7.1 kev particle decaying into two photons .",
    "the present model with @xmath0 belonging to a higgs doublet has an entirely different cosmological history ; in particular @xmath0 interacts with the weak gauge bosons with a coupling strength of @xmath21 and remains in thermal equilibrium in the early universe down to @xmath22 mev , while the singlet scalar of ref .",
    "@xcite was never thermalized .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the two higgs doublet model for warm dark matter . here",
    "we also study the experimental constraints on the model parameter . in sec .",
    "3 we derive the freeze - out temeprature of the wdm particle @xmath0 and compute its relic abundance including the late decays of @xmath1 . here",
    "we show the full consistency of the framework . in sec .",
    "4 we analyze some other implications of the model . these include supernova energy loss , dark matter self interactions , 7.1 kev @xmath4-ray anomaly , and collider signals of the model . finally in sec .",
    "5 we conclude .",
    "the model we study is a specific realization of two higgs doublet models that have been widely studied in the context of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the two higgs doublet fields are denoted as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a discrete @xmath19 symmetry acts on @xmath24 and not on any other field .",
    "this @xmath19 prevents any yukawa couplings of @xmath24 . while @xmath23 acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 , so that the @xmath19 symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "the lightest member of the @xmath24 doublet will then be stable .",
    "we shall identify one of the neutral members of @xmath24 as the wdm @xmath0 with a mass of order kev .",
    "neutrino masses are generated via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "three @xmath19 even singlet neutrinos , @xmath27 , are introduced .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian of the model is @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the sm yukawa coupling lagrangian and involves only the @xmath23 field owing to the @xmath30 reflection ( @xmath19 ) symmetry .",
    "the higgs potential of the model is @xmath31 with @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 , the masses of the various fields are obtained as @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the sm higgs boson with a mass of 126 gev ; @xmath0 and @xmath36 are the second scalar and pseudoscalar fields , while @xmath37 are the charged scalars .",
    "we wish to identify @xmath0 as the kev warm dark matter candidate .",
    "can be identified as the wdm candidate . with some redefinitions of couplings ,",
    "this scenario would lead to identical phenomenology as in the case of @xmath0 wdm . ]",
    "an immediate concern is whether the other scalars can all be made heavy , of order 100 gev or above , to be consistent with experimental data .",
    "this can indeed be done , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ masses ] ) . note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , so that even for @xmath40 kev , @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be large .",
    "however , the masses of @xmath36 and @xmath37 can not be taken to arbitrary large values , since @xmath43 are at most of order a few hundred ( gev)@xmath44 for perturbative values of @xmath45 .",
    "the boundedness conditions on the higgs potential can all be satisfied @xcite with the choice of positive @xmath46 and negative @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the kev wdm version of the two higgs doublet model would thus predict that the neutral scalar @xmath36 and the charged scalar @xmath37 have masses not more than a few hundred gev . the present limits on the masses of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are approximately @xmath49 gev ( from @xmath50 boson decays into @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 gev from lep searches for charged scalars .",
    "the precision electroweak parameter @xmath53 receives an additional contribution from the second higgs doublet , which is given by@xcite @xmath54\\ ] ] where the mass of @xmath0 has been neglected . for @xmath55 gev ,",
    "@xmath56 while for @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 .",
    "both these numbers are consistent with current precision electroweak data constraints , @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the mass splitting between @xmath37 and @xmath36 can not be too much , or else the limits on @xmath53 will be violated .",
    "for example , if @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 , which may be disfavored .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 receives a new contribution from the second higgs doublet , which is evaluated to be @xmath63 if @xmath55 gev , @xmath64 , while for @xmath57 gev , @xmath65 .",
    "these values are consistent with precision electroweak data which has @xmath66 @xcite .    in this model",
    "the decay @xmath67 can occur proportional to the quartic coupling combination @xmath68 .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xmath69 since the invisible decay of the sm higgs should have a branching ratio less than 23% @xcite , we obtain the limit ( using @xmath70 mev for the sm higgs width ) @xmath71    we thus see broad agreement with all experimental constraints in the two higgs doublet models with a kev neutral scalar identified as warm dark matter .      before proceeding to discuss the early universe cosmology within the two higgs doublet model with warm dark matter ,",
    "let us identify the parameter space of the model where the late decay of a particle occurs with a lifetime in the range of @xmath72 sec .",
    "such a decay is necessary in order to dilute the warm dark matter abundance within the model , which would otherwise be too large .",
    "a natural candidate for such late decays is one of the heavy right - handed neutrinos , @xmath1 , that participates in the seesaw mechanism for small neutrino mass generation . if its lifetime were longer than 1 sec .",
    "that would affect adversely the highly successful big bang nucleosynthesis scheme .",
    "lifetime shorter than @xmath73 sec . would not lead to efficient reheating of radiation in the present model , as that would also reheat the warm dark matter field .",
    "it turns out that the masses and couplings of the late  decaying field @xmath1 are such that its contribution to the light neutrino mass is negligibly small .",
    "the smallest neutrino mass being essentially zero can be taken as one of the predictions of the present model .",
    "we can therefore focus on the mixing of this nearly decoupled @xmath1 field with light neutrinos .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume mixing of @xmath1 with one flavor of light neutrino , denoted simply as @xmath74 .",

    "when the mass of @xmath1 is smaller than 80 gev , these two body decays are kinematically not allowed . in this case , three body decays involving virtual @xmath86 and @xmath50 will be dominant .",

    "an overall factor of 2 appears here since @xmath1 being majorana fermion decays into conjugate channels .",
    "the factor 5 inside the square bracket accounts for the virtual @xmath88 boson decaying into @xmath89 and @xmath90 for which the kinematic function @xmath91 is close to one @xcite . for @xmath92 gev , an additional piece , @xmath93 ,",

    "analogous expressions for three body decay of @xmath1 via virtual @xmath50 boson are found to be numerically less important ( about 10% of the virtual @xmath86 contributions ) and we ignore them here .",
    "virtual higgs boson exchange for three body @xmath1 decays are negligible owing to small yukawa coupling suppressions .",
    "we shall utilize expressions ( [ 2body ] ) and ( [ 3body ] ) in the next section where the relic density of @xmath0 wdm is computed .",
    "here we present a calculation of the relic abundance of @xmath0 which is taken to have a mass of order kev , and which serves as warm dark matter of the universe .",
