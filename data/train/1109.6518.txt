    "am cvn systems are accreting binaries consisting of a white dwarf accretor and a degenerate ( or semi - degenerate ) secondary .",
    "they are notable for at least two reasons : they have an extremely short orbital period ( @xmath2 70 mins ) and are almost entirely hydrogen deficient ( see solheim 2010 for a recent review ) .",
    "there are currently 27 known am cvn systems of which half a dozen have been found to exhibit at least one outburst , where they increase in brightness typically by 34 magnitudes . indeed , some systems were discovered through supernovae surveys ( eg v406 hya = 2003aw , wood - vasey et al .",
    "it is thought that the origin of these outbursts is similar to those seen in hydrogen accreting dwarf novae ( eg osaki 1996 ) .",
    "much observational and theoretical work has been done in trying to understand the origin and nature of the outbursts in the hydrogen accreting systems ( eg lasota 2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , our understanding of the cause of the outbursts seen in am cvn systems is much more limited .    on the observational side ,",
    "this is largely due to the lack of information on their long term behaviour . on the theoretical side , progress has been more limited compared to the work on hydrogen accreting systems . however , the work of smak ( 1983 ) , who described a thermal instability model , whitehurst ( 1988 ) and tsugawa & osaki ( 1997 ) who develop tidal instability models and lasota , dubus & kruk ( 2008 ) and kotko , lasota & dubus ( 2010 ) who take into account irradiation effects , are some notable advances in modelling hydrogen deficient accreting binaries .",

    "it is either brighter than @xmath3=14.5 , or fainter than @xmath3=16.5 for 90 percent of time and is brighter than @xmath3=14.5 for 70 percent of the epochs it was observed using the lt .",
    "however , our sampling is not frequent enough to determine if there is an underlying periodic or quasi - periodic signal .",
    "however , observations covering a timescale of 3 years show evidence for a quasi periodic transition between bright and faint states of 46.3 days ( kato et al . 2001 ) . on the other hand , patterson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found a prominent modulation ( @xmath01 mag ) on a period of @xmath01922 hrs ( which our data are unable to sample ) .",
    "the first nine months of our lt observations of kl dra have been reported in ramsay et al .",
    "they showed an outburst every @xmath060 days ( or roughly six per year ) , making kl dra the best example of a helium accreting dwarf nova .",
    "since then kl dra has continued to show regular outbursts . we have determined the recurrence time between successive outbursts and their peak brightness .",
    "although there is some uncertainty in determining both parameters since the cadence of our observations is variable , it is clear that the recurrence time shortened from 60 days at the beginning of our observations , to @xmath045 days after a further five outbursts ( figure [ kldra ] ) . when kl dra became visible again the recurrence time",
    "had increased to @xmath065 days .",
    "there is a hint that the peak brightness in the optical band followed the trend seen in the recurrence time .",
    "although our coverage is such that the duration of the outbursts is not well defined , the outburst with the best coverage reported by ramsay et al .",
    "( 2010 ) lasted 17 days .",
    "however , for the cycle which had a recurrence time of 44 days , the duration of the outburst prior to this lasted only 9 days .",
    "the typical duty cycle for the system being in the outburst state is 15 percent .",
    "the fact that there is a significant spread in the outburst recurrence time is entirely consistent with that seen in the hydrogen accreting dwarf novae , which can show a spread of up to a factor of 4 ( cf cannizzo , shafter & wheeler 1988 ) .",
    "we note that the _ kepler _ observations of the dwarf nova v344 lyr shows a shortening in the recurrence time of the outbursts immediately after a super - outburst , which then appears to lengthen and shorten in the lead up to the next super - outburst ( cannizzo et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "( 8,8.5 ) ( -0.5,-2 )      observations made using the catalina real - time transient survey showed five outbursts ( of amplitude @xmath03 mag ) of sdss j0926 over nearly 6 years of observations ( copperwheat et al .",
    "( our simulations suggest that roughly eight outbursts would be expected over 6 years ) .",
    "the sampling is such that the source was observed , at best , once every 20 days or so .",
    "our observations made using the lt show one clear outburst with an amplitude of @xmath02.5 mag and a duration @xmath016 days , with a second outburst for which we caught the decline phase ( at mjd@xmath055192 , cf figure [ outbursts ] ) .",
    "our data show sdss j0926 was brighter than @xmath3=18.4 mag for 8 percent of our observations .",
    "we note the presence of a brightening 8 days after the initial outburst  this maybe related to the dip seen in both cp eri and kl dra ( figure [ mean ] .",
    "we will discuss these dips further in  4 .",
    "we have detected cp eri in outburst on three occasions ( although in the first there is only one data point where our sampling was rather sparse ) .",
    "the amplitude of the outbursts is @xmath04 mag , while the rise time from the faint state to the high state was less than 5 days in the second outburst and less than 10 in the third .",
    "our data show cp eri was brighter than @xmath3=18.0 mag for 27 percent of our observations .",
    "we note a short duration drop in the intensity of cp eri 2 days after the on - set of the second burst ( cf figure [ mean ] and  [ dips ] ) .",
    "the third outburst took place @xmath0114 days after the second .",
    "the only other recorded instances of cp eri showing outbursts is luyten & haro ( 1959 ) who found it @xmath02.5 mag brighter than on the poss images and abbot et al .",
    "( 1992 ) observed it at one epoch when it was brighter still .",
    "v406 hya was originally thought to be a supernova ( 2003aw ) but subsequent spectroscopic observations showed it was an am cvn system .",
    "followup photometric observations showed that v406 hya exhibits outbursts which can be up to 5 mag in amplitude and have durations lasting two or three months ( woudt & warner 2003 , nogami et al 2004 ) .",
    "our observations using the lt showed one long duration outburst , which lasted more than 60 days and had an amplitude of 4 mag .",
    "we also observed an increase in brightness at mjd@xmath056170 which could be the decline from an outburst which was not detected ( figure 1 ) .",
    "although our observations did not have high cadence , they indicate that the rise to maximum took place on a timescale @xmath112 days , and showed a very rapid initial decline from maximum ( 4 days ) followed by a lengthy decline phase .",
    "our data show v406 hya was brighter than @xmath3=18.5 mag for 27 percent of our observations .",
    "the characteristics of this outburst are very similar to that found in nogami et al .",
    "our observations also show a very short duration ( less than 10 days ) , high amplitude outburst ( maximum at mjd=54920 ) .",
    "sdss j0129 was seen in outburst on dec 3rd 2009 when it was seen 3 mag brighter than it was 14 days earlier .",
    "it went on to reach maximum brightness after a further two days when it was 5 mag brighter than found in quiescence ( barclay et al .",
    "the shape of the light curve is very similar to v406 hya , showing a very rapid initial decline from maximum brightness ( less than a day ) and an extended tail .",
    "our data show sdss j0129 was brighter than @xmath3=18.5 mag for 22 percent of our observations .",
    "shears et al . (",
    "2011 ) have recently reported the detection of the same outburst as reported here .",
    "moreover they detected super - humps during the outburst which had a period of 38 min .",
    "since the super - hump period is typically longer than the orbital period by a few percent at most , the likely orbital period is 3738 min .      of all our ` outbursting '",
    "am cvn systems , sdss j0804 shows the lowest amplitude variations ( 1.2 mag ) and has the longest orbital period .",
    "it does not show obvious outbursts such as kl dra or sdss j0129 , but shows a light curve more similar to cr boo ( which has the shortest orbital period of our outbursting systems ) .",
    "however , in contrast to cr boo there are no clear low / high states , with 90 percent of our datapoints in the range 18.2@xmath418.8 and only 8 percent brighter than @xmath3=18.2 .",
    "it is therefore not clear whether sdss j0804 shows genuine outbursts but rather is just more active than systems which do not show outbursts .",
    "ramsay et al . ( 2010 ) found clear evidence for a short duration decrease in the optical flux of kl dra around five days after the start of the outburst . with our more extended dataset",
    ", we have identified a total of five such dips in kl dra suggesting they are not transient . moreover , similar dips are seen in our lt optical light curves of sdss j0926 and cp eri ( figure [ mean ] ) and in the recently discovered system ptf1 j0719 + 4858 ( levitan et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we show in figure [ mean ] the outburst light curve of kl dra in the optical and uv bands . given the relatively sparse cadence of our data ,",
    "this is accurate only to within a few days .",
    "however , the dip lasts 23 days and has a depth of a factor of @xmath05 compared to the pre - dip light curve .",
    "although the uv data are more scattered compared to the optical data , the uv flux tends to be weaker at the time of the optical dip .",
    "( we have included _ swift _ uv data which were taken in april 2010  after the paper by ramsay et al .",
    "2010 was accepted ) .",
    "our data do not have high enough cadence to determine whether a dip is seen in _ every _ outburst of kl dra .",
    "a dip - like feature has also been reported in the am cvn system v803 cen by kato et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who noted its similarity to the 2001 super - outburst of wz sge .",
    "this dip has been interpreted as a re - brightening due to a recurring thermal instability ( eg osaki et al .",
    "however , compared to kl dra the dip occurs much longer after the on - set of the outburst .",
    "we note that dips have also been seen in some hydrogen accreting cvs , eg t leo , ( kato 1997 ) , which are thought to due to a normal outburst triggering a superoutburst ( van der woerd & van paradijs 1987 ) .",
    "one of the main motivations for our study was to test the prediction of smak ( 1983 ) , and later elaborated by tsugawa & osaki ( 1997 ) , who suggested that systems with orbital periods in the range @xmath02040 min would experience outbursts . for am cvn systems with @xmath540 mins ,",
    "the accretion disc is predicted to be cooler than the ionisation state of helium . for binaries with @xmath520 mins ,",
    "the disc is predicted to be hotter than the ionisation state of helium . since these discs were expected to be stable it was predicted that systems would not show photometric outbursts .",
    "tsugawa & osaki ( 1997 ) indicated ( their figure 3 ) the predicted location of these thermally stable and unstable regions in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 plane for am cvn binaries . depending on whether the donor star is",
    "fully or partially degenerate may shift a particular source to the stable or unstable region .",
    "we have taken figure 3 of tsugawa & osaki ( 1997 ) as a starting point , but employed the predicted relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath6 from deloye et al .",
    "( 2007 ) which is more physical than that of the earlier work .    in the top of figure [ orb - mass ]",
    "we place a ` y ' or a ` n ' indicating whether a source shows outbursts or not ( table 1 ) .",
    "we find that all the systems with orbital periods between 2444 mins show outbursts and are located in the unstable region ( figure [ orb - mass ] ) .",
    "however , taking into account the period of the systems which do not show outbursts , the unstable region potentially extends between 1946 mins ( cf table 1 ) . at the lower end of the unstable range ,",
    "cr boo ( which is thought to have a semi - degenerate donor star roelofs et al .",
    "2007b ) is just inside the unstable regime . in the case of kl dra , which has a virtually identical orbital period",
    ", it is unknown whether its donor star is semi or fully degenerate . at the shortest orbital periods ,",
    "these systems would be stable whether their donor star was fully or semi degenerate . at longer periods ( j0804 , gp com , j1411 )",
    "these stars would be more likely to be unstable if their donor star was semi - degenerate and/or their accreting white dwarf was relatively low mass .",
    "this result indicates a remarkable agreement between the prediction of smak ( 1983 ) , tsugawa & osaki ( 1997 ) and observation .",
    "( 8,11 ) ( -0.5,-1.5 )",
    "our survey to characterise the long term behaviour of am cvn binaries has found that 10 out of the 27 systems has shown at least one outburst . moreover , the outbursting systems have periods between 24 and 44 mins  a result which is remarkably consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "it appears that systems with @xmath524 mins have an accretion disc which has a mean temperature always above the ionisation state of helium , while systems with @xmath544 mins have a disc with a mean temperature below the ionisation state of helium .",
    "of the seven systems which showed at least one outburst in our lt data , there is some evidence that the outbursts fall into three rather distinct characteristics , the nature of which may be related ( at least partly ) to their orbital period .",
    "kl dra ( 25.0 min ) , j0926 ( 28.3 min ) and cp eri ( 28.4 min ) all show outbursts lasting a week or two with a distinctive dip in the outburst profile .",
    "the recently discovered system ptf1 j0719 ( 26.8 min , levitan et al .",
    "2011 ) also shows outbursts lasting several weeks , but in addition exhibits bursts lasting several days ( which is very similar to what we observe in kl dra , although they are not well sampled ) . given our low cadence it is possible that the 5060 day outbursts seen in kl dra are super - outbursts , and the short duration bursts are normal outbursts .",
    "cr boo which has a period just shorter than kl dra ( 24.5 min ) shows a rapid change between high and low states .",
    "in addition it has shown a peculiar ` cycling ' state when it shows a prominent modulation ( @xmath01 mag ) on a period of @xmath019 - 22 hrs ( patterson et al .",
    "this photometric feature has also been seen in v803 cen ( 26.9 min ) ( patterson et al . 2000 ) . at the longer period boundary , sdss j0804 ( 44.5 mins )",
    "also shows enhanced levels of activity , but not regular outbursts .",
    "this may hint that systems on the boundary between having a stable or a non - stable accretion disc are likely to be unstable . on the other hand , given kl dra and cr boo have practically identical periods it is likely that factors other than the orbital period ( for instance , the nature and metallicity of the donor star ) affects the long term photometric behaviour .    in complete contrast , v406 hya ( 33.8 min ) and j0129 ( @xmath037 min ) show outbursts which are up to 56 mag in amplitude and which last several months .",
    "evidence exists that j1240 ( 37.4 mins ) also shows high amplitude and long duration outbursts ( shears et al .",
    "the similar period of these systems makes observations of j1427 ( which has a photometric period  probably a superhump  of 36.6 min , shears et al 2011 ) particularly interesting .",
    "does it also show similar long outbursts ? in the case of sdss j2047 + 0008 , which currently does not have a known orbital period , the fact that it has been found to go into outburst , strongly suggests that it has an orbital period between 2444 mins .",
    "our survey of am cvn binaries using the liverpool telescope coupled with existing published data shows that @xmath01/3 of these helium accreting compact binaries undergo outbursts .",
    "these outbursting systems have orbital periods within the range 2444 mins .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "moreover , we find tentative evidence for the characteristics of these outbursts to be dependent on orbital period . systems at the lower end of this period range show outbursts which last a week or two and tend to show a characteristic dip a handful of days after the start of the outburst . at longer periods ,",
    "the outbursts have greater amplitude and last for several months .",
    "systems at the edge of this period range , whether the disc is close to being in a stable hot state or a stable cool state , show rapid changes in brightness .",
    "this sequence can be seen in the context of the rapidly diminishing mass transfer rate between 2040 mins . at shorter periods",
    "the higher mass transfer rate enables the disc to achieve a critical mass on a shorter timescale than for longer period systems where the mass transfer rate is significantly lower .",
    "based on our survey we predict that j1427 will also exhibit large amplitude long duration outbursts .",
    "indeed we encourage observations of j1427 , v406 hya and j0129 to detect further outbursts so that they can be studied in much greater detail , and at different wavelengths , and determine how similar they are to the hydrogen accreting wz sge stars .    using the models of nelemans et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2004 ) , roelofs , nelemans & groot ( 2007c ) predict the population surface density of am cvn systems as a function of galactic latitude . for @xmath7",
    "they predict that around half of all am cvn binaries are expected to have orbital periods in the range 2040 mins ( irrespective of whether one assumes ` optimistic ' or ` pessimistic ' assumptions for their space density ) , although this fraction is lower for higher galactic latitudes .",
    "although we find the duty cycle is quite variable from source to source ( and indeed , not especially well constrained ) , our results indicate that a duty cycle of @xmath01/4 is not untypical , which may be due to the small disks in am cvn systems .",
    "given this reasonably high duty cycle , surveys which followup blue transient systems may provide the best method with which to discover am cvn systems .",
    "the recent discovery of ptf1 j0719 using the palomar transient factory confirms such a view ( levitan et al .",
