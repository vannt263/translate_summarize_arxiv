    "usual treatments of uniaxial incommensurate - commensurate ( ic - c ) phase transitions are based either on microscopic models with competing interactions or on phenomenological landau theories .",
    "the relevant reviews can be found in refs .",
    "the well - known example of the former is the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model  @xcite , in which the wave number of ordering goes through the devil s staircase sequence of second order phase transitions  @xcite . in the regime of weak interactions",
    "the fk model can be continuated , and so reduced to the exactly solvable ( i.  e. integrable ) sine - gordon model  @xcite . the solutions which then participate in the phase diagram are phase soliton lattices , i.  e. commensurate regions separated by so called discommensurations  @xcite .",
    "the phase transition to the commensurate state is of the second ( continuous ) order , and the devil s staircase variation of the wave number is replaced by its simple continuous dependence on the control parameter .    the phenomenological landau theory , another usual approach to the ic - c transitions , starts from the expansion of the thermodynamic potential in terms of the order parameter , relied on the symmetry requirement by which the order parameter is defined through one of the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the normal phase . e.  g. , for structural phase transitions the order parameter is defined as a set of normal coordinates of the soft mode  @xcite .",
    "generally the minimum frequency of this soft mode may be located at an arbitrary point ( i.  e. star of wave vectors ) in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the simplest irreducible representation for an uniaxial ordering is then two - dimensional .",
    "the corresponding basic ( `` minimal '' ) form of the landau expansion comprises , besides the leading normal terms , one , presumably the strongest , umklapp term allowed by symmetry .",
    "this term favors a commensurate ordering and is responsible for the lock - in transition from the incommensurate ordering favored by the elastic term .",
    "minimization of the landau functional again leads , after neglecting the space variations of the order parameter amplitude  @xcite , to the sine - gordon equation  @xcite , i.  e. to the phase diagram equal to that of the fk model after the space continuation .",
    "the above approaches predict either a dense sequence of second order phase transitions ( devil s staircase in the fk model ) or an isolated transition of the same type ( landau theory ) . both possibilities are indeed close to the observations of ic - c transitions in some materials  @xcite",
    "a majority of materials however exhibits a more complex behavior comprising one or more first order phase transitions , memory effects , wide ( `` global '' ) hystereses , finite density of solitons at the very ic - c transition , etc ( for a review see e.  g. ref .",
    "it is usually difficult to decide solely from the experimental observations , even for the most carefully prepared samples , whether such effects are of purely intrinsic or of some extrinsic origin . from the theoretical side ,",
    "they can not be explained within either of above approaches without extending the models .",
    "so far this problem was mainly considered by taking primarily into account some extrinsic agents , like external fields ( e.  g. electric field in ferroelectric materials ) , pinning centers , fixed or mobile defects , additional external periodic potentials with a periodicities different from that already present in the model ) , etc .",
    "another , more intricate possibility is that of intrinsic sources and mechanisms as the potential explanations for the afore mentioned phenomena  @xcite . in this respect",
    "the central question is the following ; what are the simplest intrinsic extensions of the above basic approaches which lead to phase diagrams with a finite sequence of first order transitions ( i.  e. harmless staircase  @xcite ) , and thus offer an inherent explanation for global hystereses and corresponding phenomena .",
    "the attempts in this direction were more successful in the realm of discrete models .",
    "the examples are models which include couplings between next nearest neighbors , like so - called diffour model  @xcite , axial next - nearest neighbor ising ( annni ) model  @xcite , as well as various extensions  @xcite , and models with two spin - like variables per site like those of chen and walker  @xcite and janssen  @xcite .",
    "both types of extensions were aimed mostly towards the interpretation of the phase diagrams observed in the family of a@xmath0bx@xmath1 compounds .",
    "on the other hand , the attempts within landau models were based on the formal inclusion of more and more umklapp terms ( i.  e. stars of wave vectors ) into the basic models for the classes i  @xcite and ii  @xcite of ic - c systems . from one side ,",
    "the relevance of the umklapp terms of high orders in the landau expansion can be hardly justified on the physical grounds . also , the ensuing analyses took into account only sinusoidal modulations , which , as the present study shows , is a too crude approximation for the determination of phase diagrams with harmless staircase , as well as for the interpretation of accompanying hysteretic effects .",
    "in contrast to such approaches , we propose in the present work a simple , physically well justified , extension of the basic landau model for the class i , which is still framed within a `` minimal '' free energy expansion for a single star of wave vectors . the phase diagram which emerges from our model",
    "is characterized by a harmless staircase and first order transitions between highly nonsinusoidal configurations with different periods .",
    "furthermore , a closer examination of configurations that participate in the phase diagram , and also of those that are not thermodynamically favored , enable a plausible explanation of the memory and hysteresis effects as the intrinsic ( or at least semi - intrinsic ) properties of ic - c systems .",
    "our considerations are based on a sine - gordon model with two umklapp terms  @xcite .",
    "this type of model is physically well - grounded whenever the landau expansion contains terms which favor two different commensurabilities , that are of comparable strengths .",
    "the most interesting case is realized with umklapp terms of third and fourth order , the lowest possible ones within the models with the lifshitz invariant , appropriate for the so - called systems of the i class  @xcite ( the systems of the ii class have lock - in transitions at the commensurabilities of order one and two , and are covered by essentially different type of landau models  @xcite ) .    the mean - field ( saddle point )",
    "approximation for our landau functional leads to the euler - lagrange ( el ) equation which has the form of the double sine - gordon equation .",
    "this is one of the most intensively studied nonintegrable problems in the contemporary classical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding phase portrait contains periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic trajectories , the latter appearing only when _ both _ nonlinear terms in the landau functional are finite . as the strength of nonlinear terms increases ,",
    "the chaotic trajectories occupy larger and larger portion of the phase space , destroying gradually quasiperiodic kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) layers , and eventually allowing only for some isolated periodic trajectories .",
    "the latter are orbitally unstable and therefore are not realized within the scope of classical mechanics .",
    "however , we show that just this tiny subset of the phase space comprises local minima of the free energy functional , i.  e. the solutions ( configurations ) which participate in the thermodynamic phase diagram .",
    "the question which then arises is analogous to that met in the analyses of the discrete models  @xcite , i.  e. are there thermodynamically stable configurations among other , quasiperiodic and chaotic , trajectories .    in order to analyze this additional , _ thermodynamic _ , aspect of the phase portrait , we calculate the average free energy for periodic , quasiperiodic and a representative set chaotic solutions of el equation , with the aim to find , for given values of control parameters , those solutions that have the lowest value of the average free energy .",
    "we show that the chaotic configurations are never thermodynamically stable , in agreement with results obtained for some discrete models  @xcite .",
    "the quasiperiodic configurations might be present in the phase diagram only when the umklapp terms are weak enough , i.  e. at temperatures slightly below the phase transition from the disordered to the incommensurate state . in the regime of strong umklapp terms ( to be specified later ) the phase diagram is completely covered by periodic configurations , and the wave number of ordering passes through a finite number of values separated by the first order transitions , i.  e. the corresponding staircase is harmless .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the landau model of uniaxial ordering with two umklapp terms and discuss its classical mechanical counterpart .",
    "the solutions of the euler - lagrange equation are considered in sec .",
    "iii , and the corresponding thermodynamic phase diagrams are presented in sec .",
    "iv . finally , in sec . v we discuss possible implications to the phenomena observed in real materials , and compare our results with those obtained in the previous analyses of the similar models and other theories of uniaxial ic - c ordering .",
    "we start from the assumption that the quadratic contribution to the landau expansion has minima at wave numbers @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 . here",
    "the unit length is taken equal to the lattice constant .",
    "the distances of @xmath6 from @xmath7 and @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , with @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ vector ] ) . from now on we shall use @xmath10 as an independent control parameter .",
    "let us furthermore specify that the order parameter is complex , @xmath12 . limiting the further analysis to the temperature range well below the critical temperature for the transition from the disordered to the incommensurate phase , we also make the usual approximation of space independent amplitude @xmath13  @xcite , and keep only the phase - dependent part of the free energy density .",
    "the latter reads @xmath14}+      c\\cos{(4\\phi-4\\delta_4 x)}. \\label{eq : free}\\ ] ] here we scale the free energy functional @xmath15 by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the correlation length in the @xmath18-direction . the first , gradient term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free ] ) is the elastic contribution which favors the incommensurate sinusoidal ordering with the wave number @xmath6 .",
    "the second and third terms are the umklapp contributions of the third and fourth order respectively . due to the closeness of the wave number @xmath6 to both respective commensurate wave numbers ,",
    "they are presumably the leading umklapp contributions , provided both are allowed by symmetry .",
    "their effective strengths are denoted by coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are proportional to the first and the second power of the amplitude @xmath13 respectively .",
    "they are another two control parameters ( beside @xmath10 ) of the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath13 is expected to be the main source of the temperature dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) covers a variety of possibilities which may take place in particular physical examples .",
    "besides the competition of each umklapp term and the elastic term present already in basic sine - gordon models , the essential new property of the present model is an additional competition between two umklapp terms .",
    "the relative importance of these two terms is relied on both , the ratio of the strengths @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the position of the wave number @xmath6 , i.  e. the ratio of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that various regimes are possible . regarding the expansion  ( [ eq : free ] ) it is reasonable to expect that the relative strength of two terms varies from the dominance of the third order term ( @xmath21 ) at temperatures not far below the transition from the disordered phase to the comparable values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at lower temperatures . however , even when @xmath21 , the relative weakness of the fourth order umklapp term can be compensated by a small value of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath9 , i.  e. by its much slower space dependence . in this case",
    "it is necessary to keep both umklapp terms in the expansion  ( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "although similar arguments may be invoked in favor of retaining some other pair of commensurate wave numbers , or even more than two of them , the example  ( [ eq : free ] ) seems to be the most interesting one , due to the lowest possible powers of @xmath13 present in the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the configurations which take part in the thermodynamic phase diagram of the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) are the solutions of the euler - lagrange ( el ) equation , @xmath22}+      4c\\sin{(4\\phi-4\\delta_4 x)}=0 , \\label{eq : el}\\ ] ] which for given values of the control parameters have the lowest value of the free energy averaged over the macroscopic length of the system , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{eq : mfe}\\ ] ]    before developing the appropriate method for the determination of such configurations , let us put few remarks on the equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) . from the classical mechanical side it represents the nonintegrable double resonance ( i.  e. double sine - gordon ) model  @xcite , with the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath25}-      c\\cos{(4\\phi-4\\delta_4 x ) } , \\label{eq : ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 . obviously for @xmath27 or @xmath28 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) and  ( [ eq : ham ] ) reduce to completely integrable sine - gordon problems . for both @xmath19 and @xmath20 finite ,",
    "one encounters the coexistence of two overlapping resonance domains .",
    "this can be easily seen with help of poincar cross section .",
    "we introduce the auxiliary variable @xmath29 and plot the poincar cross section in the phase space @xmath30 , @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the starting point of integration and @xmath33 is an integer .",
    "the resonance domains are situated around elliptic fixed points at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an integer .",
    "their respective widths are @xmath37 if @xmath28 and @xmath38 if @xmath27 . for small values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]a ) the trajectories between two resonances conserve their topological form , while chaotic trajectories exist only very close to the separatrices of both resonances . as @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 increase ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]b ) the separatrices burst out into stochastic layers which grow and eventually merge between resonance domains .",
    "one gradually arrives at the threshold of the stochasticity ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]c ) , given by the chirikov criterion  @xcite @xmath39 at which the last kam torus is destroyed , i.  e. there are no more quasiperiodic solutions between two resonances .",
    "chaotic trajectories are now free to diffuse through all phase space between two resonances .",
    "let us here mention two points relevant for the further discussion .",
    "first , the widths of the chaotic layers grow exponentially  @xcite as parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 increase . thus , the area between two resonances will be rapidly covered with chaotic layers .",
    "second , kam tori represent the main obstacles to diffusion of chaotic trajectories through phase space ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "beside the classical mechanical context , our problem has an additional aspect , namely we are looking for the thermodynamically stable solutions , i.  e. the trajectories in the phase space from figs .",
    "[ poinc]a , b , c which are local minima of the functional ( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "since we have to compare average free energies  ( [ eq : mfe ] ) of the trajectories present in the phase space , our first task is to specify numerical methods appropriate for the calculation of particular types of solutions .",
    "the orbitally unstable periodic solutions obviously can not be determined by a direct integration of el equations  ( [ eq : el ] ) , commonly used for calculation of orbitally stable solutions .",
    "it is therefore necessary to calculate them by using a suitable boundary value method for nonlinear equations .",
    "the most natural choice is the finite difference method , which is however rather demanding regarding the computer memory and time .",
    "it is therefore important to reduce the search for periodic solutions by establishing in an analytic way sufficient conditions on the possible values of periods . to this end",
    "we start from the relation @xmath40 which holds for any periodic solution . here",
    "@xmath41 is its period and @xmath42 is the phase increment per period ( note that the periodic solutions with finite @xmath42 belong to the rotational part of the phase space ) . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiper ] ) into the el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) taken at @xmath43 one gets @xmath44 } +       4c\\sin{(4\\phi-4\\delta_4 x + 4\\phi_p - 4\\delta_4 p ) } = 0 , \\label{eq : pel}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "sufficient conditions on the values of parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 follow from the requirement that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pel ] ) and  ( [ eq : el ] ) have the same form , i.  e. that @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are integers .",
    "thus we get @xmath49 obviously , each periodic solution satisfying the requirement  ( [ eq : kl ] ) is uniquely defined by a pair of integers @xmath50 which do not have a common integer factor  @xcite .",
    "note that the above procedure , in particular the step from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pel ] ) to the conditions  ( [ eq : kl ] ) , in principle does not forbid the existence of periodic solutions which do not belong to the set defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : per ] ) . however , our attempts to locate numerically such solutions , although based on two independent algorithms , present and the alternative one  @xcite , always led to a negative result .",
    "this is an indication that the solutions with the periods  ( [ eq : per ] ) are very probably the only possible periodic solutions , i.  e. that the relations  ( [ eq : kl ] ) are also the necessary conditions for their existence .",
    "the solution @xmath51 with the period ( [ eq : per ] ) has the total wave number ( that measured from the origin of brillouin zone ) @xmath52 the values of @xmath53 allowed by conditions  ( [ eq : kl ] ) form a farey tree , shown in fig .  [ farey ] for the wave numbers between @xmath54 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 )",
    ". thus , already at this introductory stage of the analysis we conclude that the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) has the phase diagram with branchings between neighboring commensurate configurations equivalent to those of annni models  @xcite .    the periodic solutions @xmath54 ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) in the farey tree of fig .",
    "[ farey ] are the basic commensurate configurations , belonging to the umklapp terms of third and fourth order respectively .",
    "the wave numbers at lower levels of the farey tree from fig .",
    "[ farey ] represent higher order commensurate solutions which correspond to all positive values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "they are situated between two main resonances in the poincar cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ poinc ] .",
    "note that for small values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 their positions in the phase space ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]a ) perfectly match positions in the farey tree ( fig .",
    "[ farey ] ) .",
    "as the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 further increase , the positions of periodic solutions that are embedded in chaotic layers become slightly intermixed since there are no more kam tori between two resonances that restrict their positions in phase space ( fig .  [ poinc]c ) .",
    "we do not include the parts of the farey tree belonging to negative values of @xmath47 and/or @xmath48 since , as it will become clear later , they are not thermodynamically stable for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    in the next step",
    "we specify boundary conditions for a particular periodic solution @xmath64 . since every periodic solution possesses at least two inflection points , we chose one of them , @xmath32 , to be the initial point of integration , i.  e. the left end point of one period . thus @xmath65 .",
    "the boundary conditions now read @xmath66 since the values of of @xmath41 and @xmath42 follow from the choice of integers @xmath50 ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : per ] ) ) , it remains to establish the connection between the other three parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which figure in the conditions  ( [ eq : percond ] ) .",
    "as it follows from the el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) with @xmath69 , @xmath70 } +       4c\\sin{(4\\phi(x_0 ) - 4\\delta_4 x_0)}=0 , \\label{eq : x0el}\\ ] ] @xmath32 and @xmath71 are not independent .",
    "even more , the numerical experience suggests that for a given periodic solution both @xmath32 and @xmath71 do not vary as we change @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 , i.  e. that eq .",
    "( [ eq : x0el ] ) in fact decomposes into two conditions , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are integers .",
    "this means that @xmath32 and @xmath71 may have values @xmath75 and @xmath76 these relations would allow for @xmath77 values of @xmath32 and an infinite number of values for @xmath71 ( for a general value of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the further analysis of symmetry properties of the problem  ( [ eq : el ] ) , as well as the numerical insight , however indicate that for any choice of periods @xmath41 and @xmath42 this enumerable set is highly degenerate and reduces to only two distinct ( nondegenerate ) solutions .",
    "the convenient choices of @xmath32 and @xmath71 characterizing these solutions for various combinations of odd and/or even values of integers @xmath47 and @xmath48 are listed in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] .",
    "the above analysis simplifies drastically the numerical procedure , since after specifying the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath32 and @xmath71 , the determination of a given periodic solution follows from the variation of the single remaining parameter @xmath78 . in accomplishing this procedure",
    "it appears convenient to eliminate , by transforming the variable @xmath51 , the explicit @xmath79dependence from one of umklapp terms in the el equation ( [ eq : el ] ) , and to keep this dependence in the term with a weaker amplitude .",
    "thus for @xmath19 larger than @xmath20 we use the variable @xmath80 ( eq .  ( [ eq : psi ] ) ) instead of @xmath51 , so that the el equation @xmath81 and its solutions @xmath80 do not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding free energy then acquires a @xmath10-dependent term in the form of lifshitz invariant , @xmath82^{2}+      b\\cos{(3\\psi)}+c\\cos{(4\\psi-\\frac{2\\pi}{3}x)}\\ } , \\label{eq : freepsi}\\ ] ] which simplifies the calculation of the @xmath10-dependence of the averaged free energy for any particular periodic solution of the el equation . as is visible in fig .",
    "[ persol ] , the form of periodic solutions resembles to that of multisoliton solutions of simple sine - gordon model ( still , note the slight modulation of commensurate regions , i.  e. between discommensurations ) when @xmath20 is larger than @xmath19 , it is appropriate to introduce an analogous variable which makes the @xmath20-term @xmath79independent , namely @xmath83 . again , the corresponding el equation does not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "the boundary conditions have to be modified correspondingly for both transformations .",
    "although the steps described above greatly simplify the numerical procedure , the finite difference method poses the limitations on the computer memory and time which do not allow us to calculate solutions with periods well above 100 .",
    "note in this respect that the nonlinearity of el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) or  ( [ eq : elpsi ] ) forces us to use about 1000 mesh points per period in order to get solutions which are reliable enough .",
    "periodic solutions of el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) show several interesting properties which are important for analysis of phase diagrams .",
    "we notice that for some values ( or ranges of values ) of parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 one of the two periodic solutions with the same values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 from tab .",
    "[ table1 ] ceases to exist ( see fig .",
    "[ split ] ) .",
    "in general the solutions with the lower value of averaged free energy are more robust to this disappearance .",
    "we do not go into a closer analysis of this effect , but only indicate that it seems to be closely connected with the destruction of kam tori as @xmath19 and @xmath20 increase .",
    "another interesting property of periodic solutions is the splitting in averaged free energies of two solutions with the same values of @xmath50 ( see fig .  [ split ] ) .",
    "as the parameter @xmath20 gradually increases from zero , while keeping @xmath19 fixed , values of the difference between these two energies increases , thus making one periodic solution more and more thermodynamically favorable with respect to the other .",
    "this splitting is larger for the solutions with smaller periods .",
    "the qualitative consequence is that such solutions participate over greater and greater parts of the phase diagram as parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 increase .    for the calculation of quasiperiodic and chaotic trajectories we use standard , adams or runge - kutta - merson , methods for an initial value problem .",
    "quasiperiodic trajectories , as a building objects of kam tori , are orbitally stable  @xcite .",
    "chaotic orbits , although certainly orbitally unstable , are diffusive through all the corresponding chaotic layer in the phase space , so that by picking one of them we get practically the averaged free energy for all chaotic solutions in that layer . thus , in order to calculate the averaged free energies of quasiperiodic and chaotic solutions we chose initial values by random ( probability of picking periodic solution instead of quasiperiodic or chaotic ones is equal to zero ) , and carry out the integration as long as the accuracy is satisfying . the fact that the averaged free energy of quasiperiodic and chaotic solutions can be determined only to a limited accuracy was already pointed out by fradkin et .",
    "al  @xcite who estimated the degree of accuracy for a given type of solution .",
    "the estimation of the common averaged free energy of chaotic solutions within a given layer can be done as follows  @xcite .",
    "the average value of umklapp terms in the expression  ( [ eq : freepsi ] ) is zero since these terms contain trigonometric functions with an argument which chaotically ( randomly ) varies with @xmath18 . for the fourth order",
    "umklapp term @xmath84 we have @xmath85 while for the third order umklapp term we have an average of @xmath86 which is also zero .",
    "the averaged free energy is thus given by the integral of the gradient term @xmath87 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the latter depends on the position and the width of chaotic layer in the phase space , i.  e. only on the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath18 along the trajectory in this layer .    in order to determine a solution with the lowest average free energy we follow solutions ( periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic ) with initial conditions that belong to the line @xmath89 in the phase space @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ poinc ] ) , and compute their average free energies . for small values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "periodic and quasiperiodic solutions are regularly arranged in the phase space ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]a ) , with hardly distinguishable average free energies ( fig .  [ fpsid]a ) . in order to show that the solution with the lowest free energy is periodic , we follow downwards the branch of the farey tree ( fig .  [ farey ] ) which starts at the point with the averaged free energy lower that those for neighboring points above and below this point .",
    "it is a numerical evidence that the average free energies increase ( and tend to some finite value ) as we go down through successive branch points , i.  e. through the solution with larger and larger periods .",
    "quasiperiodic solutions can be regarded as asymptotic limits of series of periodic solutions defined by successive branchings in the farey tree , in which the period and the phase increment tend to infinity ( but with a finite , irrational , value of @xmath53 ) .",
    "the averaged free energies of quasiperiodic solutions thus should be equal to the limiting values of averaged free energies at a given branch , which are , as is argued above , higher than the averaged free energy of the starting periodic solution .",
    "since this argument is based on numerical calculations , it can not be extended to very small values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for which the solution with the lowest free energy , as well as the solutions at the accompanying branch in the farey tree , have too large periods .    in the range of intermediate values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fpsid]b ) there are intervals of initial conditions in which quasiperiodic solutions disappear , and only chaotic and periodic solutions are present .",
    "the chaotic layers can be easily recognized in the poincar cross section ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]b ) .",
    "the average free energies of periodic solutions then look as needle - like minima immersed in the average free energy of chaotic layers , represented by plateaux in fig .",
    "[ fpsid]b . finally , for large values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fpsid]c ) for which the chirikov criterion  ( [ eq : chirc ] ) is fulfilled , there remains a single chaotic layer between two resonance domains ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]c ) , while the number of existing periodic solutions gradually decreases as @xmath19 and @xmath20 increase . since there remains a finite number of corresponding well defined needle - like minima , it is sufficient to limit the numerical calculations to the search for existing periodic solutions , and to find out among them the solution that has the lowest average free energy .",
    "we have argued in the previous section that the configurations with minimal average free energy are among periodic solutions of el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) . before presenting results of numerical calculations which confirm this expectation",

    "can be obtained from the neutron scattering , nmr and similar experimental data for particular materials ( e.  g. references  @xcite ) . as for the pressure dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "it can be specified only after the insight into the microscopic model for a particular material on which the landau theory is based .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 also might be temperature and/or pressure dependent .",
    "usually , in a concrete physical situation certain dependences may be regarded as dominant .",
    "e.  g. , when temperature varies and pressure is constant @xmath10 can be often regarded as constant , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are temperature dependent .",
    "having this in mind we simplify the further discussion by keeping one of the parameters fixed and concentrating on phase diagrams in remaining two - dimensional parameter subspaces .",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath10 , the position of the instability with respect to the wave number of the fourth order commensurability , is expressed through the lifshitz invariant @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freepsi ] ) which favors the incommensurate ordering . on the other side two umklapp terms favor commensurate orderings with their respective wave numbers . for @xmath95 , and fixed values of parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the umklapp term of the fourth order dominates with respect to that of the third order , and the thermodynamically stable periodic solution is expected to have the wave number @xmath96 .",
    "on the same footing , for @xmath10 near @xmath97 ( i.  e. for @xmath98 ) the stabilization of the modulation with @xmath99 is preferred .",
    "for @xmath100 we expect that some other higher - order wave numbers of modulation become thermodynamically stable and that they follow the order specified by the farey tree from fig .",
    "[ farey ] .",
    "let us now fix the parameter @xmath19 and allow for the variation of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath20 .",
    "for a particular value of @xmath20 we find periodic solutions of the el equation  ( [ eq : elpsi ] ) by following the steps from sec .",
    "iii , and calculate their average free energy  ( [ eq : freepsi ] ) for a relevant range of values of the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "then we determine a solution which is the absolute minimum of the average free energy for a given value of @xmath10 , and in particular the isolated values of @xmath10 at which first order phase transitions take place since two ( or more ) configurations are simultaneously absolute minima of the free energy .",
    "varying also systematically the parameter @xmath20 we obtain the phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cd4b02 ] for @xmath101 .",
    "all lines in this diagram represent the phase transitions of the first order between the periodic configurations with different wave numbers ( which are denoted only for few dominant phases in the diagram ) .",
    "note that the chirikov line  ( [ eq : chirc ] ) is at @xmath102 , and that below @xmath103 there is a proliferation of configurations with commensurabilies of higher and higher orders .",
    "the absence of these configurations at larger values of @xmath20 is mostly due to the fact that , although they exist as solutions of the el equation , their average free energies are too high in comparison to those of the solutions with lower commensurabilities .",
    "in addition , some periodic solutions simply cease to exist as @xmath20 ( or @xmath19 ) increase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ split ] .",
    "note also that only one of two different classes of periodic solutions with the same values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 participates in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ cd4b02 ] , i.  e. that characterized by the initial conditions from the second rows ( depending on evenness and oddness of integers @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] .",
    "still , we find out numerically that the average free energies for two different solutions with the same @xmath50 may change order , i.  e. that the solutions from the first rows in tab .  [ table1 ] may have lower average free energy than those from the second rows provided they are of rather high commensurability .",
    "thus , it is somewhat surprising that in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ cd4b02 ] the periodic solutions with only one type of boundary conditions prevail .",
    "we shall come back to this point later in sec .",
    "v.    in addition to the phase diagram , we plot in fig .",
    "[ devb02 ] the corresponding staircase , i.  e. the wave number of the stable configuration _ vs _",
    "parameters @xmath20 and @xmath10 .",
    "as long as @xmath20 is not very small there is a finite number of steps , i.  e. we obtain the so - called harmless staircase , introduced by villain and gordon  @xcite .",
    "we stress that the most interesting property of the phase diagram from figs .",
    "[ cd4b02 ] and [ devb02 ] , the presence of a finite ( small ) number of stable commensurate configurations , is encountered in the regime of rather high values of parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the phase portrait of the el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) is then almost everywhere chaotic ( fig .",
    "[ poinc]c ) and there are no more quasiperiodic solutions between two resonances . by increasing further the values of parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 one eventually comes to the phase diagram in which only two main commensurate phases ( @xmath54 and @xmath58 ) take place .",
    "another possible presentation of the phase diagram is that with a fixed value of the parameter @xmath10 and with varying parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is presumably closer to usual physical situations in which only weak temperature and pressure dependences of @xmath10 are expected .",
    "the construction of the @xmath104 phase diagram is however computationally more demanding , since one has to look for the solution with the lowest average free energy within a set of solutions for given values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , i.  e. one has to calculate the whole set of periodic solutions of the el equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : el ] ) or ( [ eq : elpsi ] ) ] for each point in the two - dimensional phase diagram .",
    "to this end we use a mesh of points which is dense enough in the @xmath104 plane , and determine the solution with the lowest average free energy at each point . the phase diagram obtained in this way for @xmath105",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ d4fix ] . note that again only configurations with rather low orders of commensurability , i.  e. with small values of parameters @xmath50 , are present above the chirikov line ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : chirc ] ) ) , while below this line the diagram is more complex since a great number of first order transitions takes place within a small part of the phase diagram .",
    "the most important conclusions of the above analysis follow from the thermodynamic phase diagram obtained in the regime of comparable strengths of two umklapp terms included into the landau expansion  ( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "at first we emphasize that only one type of solutions of the corresponding el equation , namely periodic configurations , participates in the phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , all phase transitions between successive commensurate phases are of the first order , so that the wave number of ordering follows a harmless staircase with a finite number of steps . the examples of such phase diagram , namely series of successive lock - in commensurate - commensurate transitions with accompanying effects which characterize first order transitions  @xcite , are often encountered in particular materials . here we focus our attention on few well known examples .    one of the most studied type of materials are a@xmath0bx@xmath1 compounds , among which we take rb@xmath0znbr@xmath1 as a prominent representative . early neutron diffraction measurements  @xcite of the temperature variation of modulation wave number revealed the existence of several higher - order commensurate phases .",
    "the more complete pressure - temperature phase diagram followed from various subsequent data , in particular again from the neutron diffraction measurements of parlinski et al .",
    "it resembles to a great extent to our phase diagrams from figs .",
    "[ cd4b02 ] and [ d4fix ] .",
    "note also that the phenomenological formula for wave numbers of observed commensurate phases introduced by parlinski et al .",
    "@xcite coincides to our expression for farey tree  ( [ eq : qkl ] ) , which is , as is shown in sec .",
    "iii , inherent to the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "harmless staircase are clearly seen in e.  g. pressure variation of the wave vector for a fixed temperature  @xcite , with steps going as @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 by increasing pressure .",
    "they are accompanied by hysteresis in pressure and temperature runs , which are particularly strong when only a few steps appear in the phase diagram .",
    "this corresponds to the regime of rather high values of parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in which the phase diagram contains only few commensurate phases and the average free energy of chaotic plateau is well above average free energies of periodic solutions ( fig .",
    "[ fpsid]c ) .",
    "existing theoretical approaches to the ( in)commensurate orderings in a@xmath0bx@xmath1 compounds , in particular to the appearance of series of commensurate phases , are mostly phenomenological , based either on landau expansions  @xcite or on the discrete models of competing local interactions  @xcite .",
    "the justification for the continuous landau models , which are generally appropriate to weak coupling systems , comes from many experimental indications , starting from the early neutron scattering data  @xcite , showing a well - defined dispersion curves for collective modes with distinct soft - mode minima .",
    "however , the previous analyses of landau models were restricted to purely sinusoidal modulation , and , as such were not able to explain the appearance of phases with commensurabilities of orders higher than three or four .",
    "it was therefore proposed that such phases appear due to the presence of umklapp terms of higher orders in the free energy expansion  @xcite .",
    "this explanation , which is based on the assumption that distinct commensurate stars of wave vectors are necessary for the stabilization of , presumably sinusoidal , phases with corresponding wave vectors  @xcite , is not convincing since the umklapp terms of order higher than four are expected to be negligible in weakly coupled systems with a displacive order .    for these reasons the more recent attempts turned again towards another type of approaches , those which assume strong couplings , so that the lattice discreteness has to be taken into account .",
    "originally the sequences of ic - c and c - c phase transitions were within this scheme interpreted in terms of the fk model as devil s staircase dependences of the wave number of ordering , i.  e. as dense sequences of second order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "however , observed staircase rarely resemble , even within experimental limitations , to the dense devil s staircase . beside ,",
    "phase transitions between successive c phases are usually of the first order .",
    "the phase diagrams which are closer to experimental findings may be however obtained by various extensions of the basic fk model , e.  g. by including an additional harmonic potential  @xcite . also , the more complex models of competing interactions , e.  g. diffour  @xcite and annni  @xcite models , as well as models that assume two critical modes per lattice site  @xcite , are particularly successful in describing the phase transitions in a@xmath0bx@xmath1 compounds . within some of these models ( e.  g. refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) one also obtains the first order phase transitions between configurations having the same wave numbers but different symmetries . as was already stated in sec .",
    "iv , this is not the case within the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) , i.  e. although the el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) may possess two types of solutions with the same periods , only one type of solutions participates in the phase diagram .",
    "the present analysis again starts from the minimal landau expansion ( with terms up to the fourth order ) , but takes into consideration all solutions of the corresponding el equation .",
    "in particular it indicates that the theoretical approach  @xcite , proposed together with the first neutron scattering measurements on rb@xmath0znbr@xmath1 , might be essentially sufficient for the understanding of complex phase diagrams in a@xmath0bx@xmath1 materials . the more detailed analysis which takes into account some additional aspects , like the couplings to the homogeneous polarization and strain which appear in some materials as secondary order parameters ,",
    "will be done elsewhere .",

    "it shows an exceptionally rich staircase going from @xmath54 down to @xmath110 , with numerous intermediate steps of higher orders  @xcite .",
    "a closer insight into the region of phase diagram with the wave number between @xmath54 and @xmath58 shows that only upper right triangle of the farey tree from fig .",
    "[ farey ] is realized , i.  e. the phase diagram is mostly covered by wave vectors close to @xmath58 , and not by those close to @xmath54 .",
    "this sequence of ic - c transitions was successfully interpreted within various discrete models with competing interactions , e.  g. in refs .",
    "@xcite . within the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) such phase diagram corresponds to the regime in which the fourth order umklapp term dominates with respect to that of the third order .",
    "also , two types of extensions of our model may lead to the stabilization of commensurate phases with @xmath111 .",
    "namely , one may allow for negative values of the parameter @xmath10 , or start with other umklapp terms , e.  g. with those of the fourth and fifth order , and pursue the analysis analogous to that of secs .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "we also mention some other materials that exhibit a sequence of ic - c and c - c phase transitions between @xmath54 and @xmath58 , but are not so extensively studied as previous two examples .",
    "e.  g. , dnoyer et al .",
    "@xcite investigated nh@xmath1hseo@xmath1 and its deuterated version nd@xmath1dseo@xmath1 by neutron diffraction , and found the harmless staircase and first order phase transitions , accompanied by the coexistence of several phases in the relatively wide range of temperatures .",
    "a series of ic - c and c - c phase transitions are also observed in bazngeo@xmath1 in x - ray diffraction measurements by sakashita et al .",
    "@xcite , and in electron diffraction measurements by yamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite which also provide dark field images of discommensurations appearing in the vicinity of @xmath54 phase .",
    "an example of particularly sharp transition from @xmath54 to @xmath58 , with a very wide temperature range of the coexistence of these two commensurate phases , was found by broda  @xcite in ( nh@xmath1)@xmath0cocl@xmath1 , the material that also belongs to a@xmath0bx@xmath1 family .",
    "the free energy  ( [ eq : free ] ) is similar to that of fradkin et al .",
    "@xcite who also studied continuum systems with competing periodicities .",
    "the only difference between two expressions is the absence of the factors 3 and 4 in front of the variable @xmath51 in the cosine terms of the model  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to ours , the analysis carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite is limited to the close vicinity of the separatrices ( and hyperbolic points ) in the phase space  @xcite , i.  e. to the dilute soliton lattices .",
    "then the continuum model can be converted into a discrete mapping of the fk type , analyzed in detail previously by aubry  @xcite .",
    "our analysis covers the whole phase space , i.  e. all solutions of the el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) , and in particular the whole class of periodic configurations .",
    "in particular , our thermodynamic phase diagram ( figs .  [ cd4b02 ] and [ d4fix ] ) includes , in contrast to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , the most interesting part of the phase space , namely that between two resonances ( i.  e. sets of hyperbolic points ) .",
    "the model  @xcite was the starting point in the investigation  @xcite of the memory effects in systems with ic modulations , based on the earlier proposition  @xcite that mobile defects might be responsible , by forming defect density waves , for the sensitivity of the ic ordering on the thermal history of crystal , observed e.  g. in thiourea  @xcite .",
    "errandonea  @xcite argued that the double sine - gordon model , with two lock - in potentials originating from the lattice the defect density wave , is an appropriate description of this phenomena .",
    "the model  ( [ eq : free ] ) provides the explanation of memory effects ( together with thermal hystereses ) , without referring , in contrast to models  @xcite , to defects as an intrinsic ingredient of the theory . at first",
    ", we note that the crossings of lines of first order phase transitions in figs .",
    "[ cd4b02 ] , [ devb02 ] and [ d4fix ] are accompanied by hystereses .",
    "our preliminary analysis  @xcite indicates that these hystereses may be rather wide on e.  g. temperature scale .",
    "furthermore , the present analysis of the el equation  ( [ eq : el ] ) shows that periodic solutions , which constitute the phase diagram , are immersed as isolated points into the environment of chaotic configurations .",
    "this environment prevents both , the continuous variation of the wave number of ordering and the continuous phase transitions of the second and higher orders . the average free energy of chaotic solutions from fig .",
    "[ fpsid]c is the measure of the energetic barrier which the system has to overcome in order to pass from some periodic ( metastable ) configuration to another one with lower free energy .",
    "this is expected to be a common property of models which are nonintegrable ( beside being nonlinear ) , and have thermodynamically stable periodic configurations isolated in the chaotic phase space  @xcite .",
    "the memory effects are also observed in class ii of ic systems  @xcite .",
    "the detailed analysis of phase diagram for this class  @xcite led to the conclusion that the corresponding phenomena seen in particular materials may be as well interpreted in terms similar to those presented above .",
    "however , it was also stressed  @xcite that defects may have a secondary role as triggers which favor the stabilization of some domain patterns .",
    "this interpretation invokes neither the mobility of defects nor the formation of defect density waves .",
    "the analogous secondary influence of defects on memory phenomena is expected also in presently investigated systems of class i.    finally , let us mention a common problem that arises in the analysis of continuous nonintegrable landau models for uniaxial systems of classes i  @xcite and ii  @xcite , in which periodic solutions have an essential role in the extremalization of corresponding thermodynamic functionals .",
    "we remind that there is no firm universal principle which would favor the thermodynamic stability of the ( meta)stable periodic configurations on account of other , quasiperiodic or chaotic , solutions of el equations .",
    "some hints in this direction for `` autonomous '' functionals ( those for which the free energy density does not depend explicitly on @xmath18 ) follow from the recently derived general criteria  @xcite based on the additional extremalizations ( like e.  g. those involving boundary conditions ) .",
    "however , these criteria can not be directly applied to the present model since the explicit @xmath18-dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free ] ) introduces fundamental singularities in the additional extremalizatons  @xcite .",
    "thus , the most important property of the phase diagrams from figs .  [ cd4b02 ] and [ d4fix ]",

    "<S> we study the landau model for uniaxial incommensurate - commensurate systems of the i class by keeping umklapp terms of third and fourth order in the expansion of the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> it applies to systems in which the soft mode minimum lies between the corresponding commensurate wave numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the minimization of the landau functional leads to the sine - gordon equation with two nonlinear terms , equivalent to the equation of motion for the well - known classical mechanical problem of two mixing resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the average free energies for periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic solutions of this equation , and show that in the regime of finite strengths of umklapp terms only periodic solutions are absolute minima of the free energy , so that the phase diagram contains only commensurate configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transitions between neighboring configurations are of the first order , and the wave number of ordering goes through harmless staircase with a finite number of steps . </S>",
    "<S> these results are the basis for the interpretation of phase diagrams for some materials from the i class of incommensurate - commensurate systems , in particular of those for a@xmath0bx@xmath1 and bccd compounds . </S>",
    "<S> also , we argue that chaotic barriers which separate metastable periodic solutions represent an intrinsic mechanism for observed memory effects and thermal hystereses . </S>"
