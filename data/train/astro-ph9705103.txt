    "the enormous infrared luminosities ( @xmath1 discovered in merging galaxies could originate from enhanced fueling of supermassive black holes surrounded by large column densities of dust and gas , dust heated by starburst activity , or galactic winds driven by starburst activity or the kinetic energy of colliding galaxies ( e.g. , soifer et al .",
    "1984 , sanders et al .",
    "detection of time - variable high - energy radiation from ultraluminous infrared ( @xmath2 ) galaxies , or uligs , would prove the existence of agns in these systems and support the interpretation that quasar activity is related to mergers ( sanders et al .",
    "if vigorous star formation or galactic winds rather than nuclear activity produce the infrared emission , significantly less hard x - ray and soft gamma - ray emission is expected ( rephaeli et al . 1991 ; rephaeli , ulmer , & gruber 1994 ) . photons with energies @xmath3 kev are attenuated by photoelectric absorption in solar composition material with hydrogen column densities @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "compton scattering opacity dominates photoelectric absorption at photon energies @xmath6 kev , but the klein - nishina decline in the compton cross section above @xmath7 kev makes the escape of higher - energy photons more probable .",
    "gamma - ray observations therefore provide the best means for detecting a dust - enshrouded agn ( see , e.g. , krolik , madau , & zycki 1994 ) .    here",
    "we report observations of arp 220 , mrk 273 , and mrk 231 using the oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) .",
    "these three uligs are among the most luminous galaxies within 200 mpc at any wavelength , with bolometric luminosities almost two orders of magnitude higher than ordinary spiral galaxies and similar to that of quasars .",
    "all three galaxies show signs of interactions and mergers , for example , a double nucleus in arp 220 , a jetlike protusion in mrk 273 probably due to a disk distorted by tidal effects , and tidal tails in mrk 231 .",
    "large quantities of molecular gas , which are necessary to fuel agns or produce vigorous starburst activity , are found in all three systems .",
    "signatures of seyfert - like nuclei are found in mrk 273 and mrk 231 , with the latter source displaying h@xmath8 line widths characteristic of a seyfert 1 nucleus ( for a recent review , see sanders & mirabel 1997 ) .",
    "table 1 gives the infrared luminosities , redshifts , and distances of arp 220 , mrk 273 , and mrk 231 , along with the measured upper limits for the ratios of the 50 - 200 kev gamma ray luminosities to the 8 - 1000 @xmath9 m infrared luminosities .",
    "our non - detections place limits on the luminosity of the central source and the column density of intervening gas .",
    "we describe the observations in  2 , and in  3 we construct multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of these galaxies .",
    "our monte carlo simulation of a nuclear source surrounded by a gaseous torus is described in  4 , and the implications of the observations are discussed in  5 .",
    "osse , one of four instruments on _ cgro _ , is designed to detect gamma rays in the @xmath10  mev range .",
    "osse comprises four independent phoswich spectrometers of identical design that are each actively shielded and passively collimated .",
    "tungsten collimators define a @xmath11 full - width at half - maximum gamma - ray aperture .",
    "table 2 summarizes the osse observations , plotted in fig . 1 , of the three uligs observed to date .",
    "the upper limits for the fluxes in the 50  100 kev and 100  200 kev energy ranges are given at the 95% ( 2@xmath12 ) confidence level , assuming an intrinsic source spectrum with photon spectral index @xmath13 .",
    "the upper limits are constant within @xmath14% for @xmath15 .",
    "upper limits in the 200  400 kev and 400  700 kev ranges are also shown in fig . 1 , but are much less constraining than the lower energy data for typical agn x-@xmath16 ray spectra with @xmath17 .",
    "the spectra in the sample were analysed uniformly , with similar data - selection criteria applied to all observations according to the procedures described by johnson et al .",
    "quadratic interpolation in time among the measured background intervals is used to estimate the background during the source observation .",
    "standard background offsets of 4.5@xmath18 on either side of the source positions along the detector scan plane were used .",
    "the background estimates are then subtracted from the associated source accumulations to form two - minute difference spectra .",
    "these spectra are further screened for environmental effects and transient phenomena",
    ". screened 2-minute spectra are then summed into daily average spectra and finally into spectra averaged over the entire observation interval or , as in the case of arp 220 , the entire set of observations .",
    "figure 1 shows multiwavelength @xmath19 spectra of the three uligs observed with osse , including the 2@xmath12 upper limits derived in the present analysis .",

    "1996 ) , namely @xmath43 kev and 400 kev .",
    "we assume solar abundances for the neutral torus material using the photoelectric absorption cross - sections of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) and the full klein - nishina cross section ( see chiang , dermer , & skibo 1997 for a full discussion of the model ) .",

    "determining the source of the far - infrared radiation in uligs is important for questions of galaxy and quasar evolution .",
    "ultraluminous iras galaxies seem to provide the clearest observational link between galaxy mergers and nuclear activity ( stockton 1990 ) .",
    "it has long been known that galaxies with active nuclei have large infrared luminosities ( rieke & low 1972 ) , and it has been argued that uligs are the parent population of quasars ( soifer et al .",
    "1986 ; sanders et al .",
    "the coincidence between the bolometric luminosities of uligs and the luminosities of bright seyfert galaxies ( sanders et al .",
    "1988b ) suggests that the infrared emission from these galaxies is reprocessed uv and x - radiation emitted by active galactic nuclei .",
    "one possible explanation for the non - detection of gamma - rays from arp 220 , mrk 273 , and mrk 231 is that the agns are hidden behind a very large column of gas with @xmath58 @xmath5 .",
    "the total mass of gas is limited , however , by observations at other wavelengths .",
    "dynamical masses inferred from observations of arp 220 require that the gas mass not exceed @xmath59 m@xmath60 within 350 pc ( shier , rieke , & rieke 1994 ) , implying that @xmath61 @xmath5 for a covering factor of one .",
    "observations of millimeter wave co emission suggest that the gas mass in mrk 273 is not more than @xmath62 m@xmath60 for mrk 273 ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "1996b ) . as the gas distributions are typically a few hundred parsec in extent ( scoville et al .",
    "1991 ) , the implied column density is @xmath63 @xmath5 , again assuming uniform covering . in the case of mrk 231 , a gas mass @xmath64 m@xmath65 is measured within a sphere of radius 420 pc ( byrant & scoville 1996 ) .",
    "the molecular gas must be distributed in a disk with additional scattering from high latitude gas to account for the spectropolarimetry observations of smith et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and the 2 magnitudes of visual extinction inferred from optical reddening of continuum and line emission ( boksenberg et al .",
    "rudy et al . ( 1985 ) find that @xmath66 @xmath5 from spectroscopy of na in mrk 231 , which is consistent with measured absorption - line features characteristic of broad absorption - line qsos ( smith et al .",
    "1995 ) , which are found to have column densities @xmath67 @xmath5 ( e.g. , green & mathur 1996 ) .",
    "the covering factor for the gas can not , in a statistical sense , be much smaller than 1 , due to the presence of more ir - luminous galaxies than optically selected agn in the local universe at a bolometric luminosity of @xmath68 l@xmath60 ( schmidt & green 1983 ; soifer et al .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that for the specific cases of arp 220 and mrk 273 , patchy column densities have hidden the nuclear sources of the ir radiation .",
    "the column density to the nucleus of mrk 231 is @xmath69 @xmath5 , so that the hard x - ray observations reported by rieke ( 1988 ) constrain the luminosity of any buried agn to contribute @xmath70% of the ir power .    to summarize",
    ", we have placed limits on the gamma - ray fluxes of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies arp 220 , mrk 273 , and mrk 231 , with 2@xmath12 upper limits in the 50 - 200 kev band of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ergs s@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the measured gamma - ray to infrared luminosity ratios do not provide evidence in favor of the interpretation that the ultraluminous infrared radiation is reprocessed agn emission .",
    "we are unable to rule out the possibility that arp 220 , mrk 273 , and mrk 231 are quite variable in gamma - rays , and that our failure to detect them is due to observing them in the low state .",
    "osse observations would constrain the duty cycle of putative agn activity . other possibilities to account for our nondetections are that patchy columns obscure our lines - of - sight to the nuclear sources in arp 220 and mrk 273 , or that accretion - disk spectra in uligs are unlike other agns . by penetrating to column densities corresponding to @xmath74 , the osse results strengthen recent _ iso _ observations ( lutz et al . 1996 ; sturm et al .",
    "1996 ) which indicate that most uligs , including arp 220 , are powered by starbursts .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence from the hard x - ray and @xmath16-ray observations that agns provide the source of the far - infrared luminosity in arp 220 , mrk 273 , and mrk 231 .",
