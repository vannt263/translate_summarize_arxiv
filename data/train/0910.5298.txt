    "a gauged linear sigma model ( glsm ) in two dimensions @xcite is capable of describing a curved geometry ( typically a sympletic or khler quotient space ) through gauge theory language .",

    "then , the curved geometry @xmath10 arises as the supersymmetric vacuum ( moduli space ) of the 2d gauge theory .",
    "note that @xmath11 stands for @xmath12 complexified @xmath13 s with moment maps @xmath14 @xmath15 parameterizing @xmath16 represents the lowest component of an @xmath17=(2,2 ) chiral superfield @xmath18 . also , @xmath19 s are called fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) parameters which bring in @xmath12 khler classes .",
    "modulo the following gauge symmetry @xmath20 is exactly the vacuum manifold denoted as @xmath10 or @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , a hyperkhler quotient space is defined by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) where @xmath24 is generated by vector fields @xmath6 s with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 : metric ) and @xmath27 .",
    "three complex structures @xmath28 @xmath29 are @xmath30 for each @xmath31 described by @xmath32 @xmath33 and transform as a triplet under @xmath34 .",

    "we have followed pioneering works @xcite .",
    "we extend their @xmath17=(4,4 ) models to include generic 8d hyperkhler geometries dual to type iib @xmath15-brane configurations @xcite .",
    "moreover , taking an infra - red ( ir ) limit leads to frozen kinetic terms of vector - multiplets . by integrating them out , a nonlinear sigma model ( nl@xmath47 m ) can be realized in the higgs branch ; that is , the quotient space metric is now pulled back onto worldsheet s kinetic term .",
    "the latter case is an @xmath17=(2,2 ) model which provides instead a cy 4-fold at ir .",
    "it is not the traditional one @xcite which executes a sympletic quotient because it possesses all key features of 3d @xmath17=2 chern - simons - matter theories on a stack of m2-branes probing toric cy 4-folds .",
    "namely , usually f - term conditions ( defining a master space ) and d - term ones as a whole give a cy 3-fold as the story happens in 4d @xmath17=1 superconformal field theories ( scft ) .",
    "however , because of the appearance of one @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath48 here , the d - term constraint associated with @xmath48 becomes redundant due to @xmath2 fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) parameters and a 4-fold emerges thereof .",
    "remarkably , we find these properties definitely show up in our model .",
    "we demonstrate this mechanism via one explicit example  a 4-fold arising from @xmath49 .    in section 2 , a taub - nut ( alf ) space constructed by means of hyperkhler quotient and its corresponding glsm",
    "are reviewed .",
    "then , in section 3 we write down our model mentioned above whose higgs branch probes generic 8d hyperkhler manifolds .",

    "finally , our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "to begin with , let us see how a multi - centered taub - nut ( or alf ) space can be constructed by means of hyperkhler quotient @xcite .",
    "after then , we go to acquaint ourselves with the glsm description of it according to @xcite .",
    "the very quotient procedure is exactly carried out in the higgs branch of the proposed glsm at ir .",
    "non - zero hyper - multiplets take their values in a hyperkhler manifold thereof .    as said in section 1 , from @xmath50",
    "one can construct a hyperkhler manifold @xmath22 with @xmath41 being triholomorphic , i.e. it does not alter the hyperkhler structure .",

    "recently , this kind of geometry has been studied quite intensively in the context of ads / cft because 11d supergravity solutions of the type @xmath133 are dual to various 3d @xmath17=3 scfts newly found in @xcite called eschenburg space @xmath134 ( up to an orbifold identification ) is shown to be dual to new @xmath17=3 scfts in @xcite . ] .    as mentioned before",

    "the higgs branch of the former @xmath17=(4,4 ) glsm manifests itself as a generic 8d hyperkhler quotient space at the infra - red regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter @xmath17=(2,2 ) glsm has a more flexible superpotential @xmath225 as well as chiral matter contents spelt out by a quiver diagram .",
    "usually , d- and f - term constraints give rise to a toric cy 3-fold just as in familiar 4d @xmath17=1 scft setups . nevertheless ,",
    "owing to a novel mechanism introduced in section 4 , 3-folds are promoted to 4-folds exactly the same way as what happens in recently - developed 3d @xmath17=2 chern - simons - matter theories which have toric cy 4-folds as their moduli spaces . in words",
    ", in addition to the diagonal gauge field @xmath343 , an ungauged dual photon @xmath344 as well does not enter the quotient process due to @xmath2 fayet - iliopoulos parameters .",
    "therefore , the moduli space dimension is enhanced from six to eight .",
    "the extra two dimensions effectively result from degrees of freedom of a chiral superfield @xmath101 .",
    "parameters @xmath345 in our 2d lagrangian satisfying @xmath254 are arbitrary integers .",
    "their role is analogous to 3d quiver chern - simons levels .",
    "we discussed the whole story via a very well - developed 3-fold @xmath49 .",
