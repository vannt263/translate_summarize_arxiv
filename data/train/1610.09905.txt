    "one of the main questions that arise when comparing predictions of quantum theory with experiment is to what extent the real physical properties of micro - objects correspond to the observed values , measured with macro - devices .",
    "heisenberg noted in his book @xcite that this essential question of quantum theory is close to the general analysis of our perception of `` phenomenon '' of our world and the gist of the phenomenon , the `` noumenon '' , according to kant @xcite .    from the point of view of the simplest `` orthodox '' version of the quantum mechanical formalism @xcite",
    ", a process of measurement corresponds to expansion of a microsystem state vector @xmath3 into a superposition of a macroscopically definitive states @xmath4 :    @xmath5    where , according to the law of born , @xmath6 defines the probability to find the system in state @xmath4 after measurement .",
    "usually one takes @xmath4 as a set of eigenvectors of hermitian operator @xmath7 which corresponds to some physical characteristics ( observables ) @xmath8 of the microsystem studied . of course , the expansion ( [ superposition ] ) and law of born may be generalized in terms of povms ( positive operator - valued measures  a description of a measurement using positively - defined operators ) and the projection postulate of dirac  von  neumann @xcite .",
    "however it is not important for the consequent arguments which approach is used .",
    "we will use the simplest one , i.e. the superposition principle ( [ superposition ] ) and the law of born .    let a microsystem now have two distinct observables @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 which have spectra @xmath10 and @xmath11 accordingly .",
    "if physical characteristics @xmath8 and @xmath9 may be simultaneously measured ( i.e. may be measured with zero dispersion with a pair of macroscopic devices of the same type ) , then the vectors by which the state @xmath3 is expanded must be the common eigenvectors of the operators @xmath7 and @xmath12 , leading to the commutation condition @xmath13 = 0 $ ] .",
    "if the operators @xmath7 and @xmath12 do not commute , then they do not have a common system of eigenvectors . in this case the observables @xmath8 and @xmath9 can not be measured together by any macro - device .",
    "the simplest example of the observables that can not be measured together is the projection of a fermion spin onto two non - parallel directions , which are defined by unit vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "another example is the @xmath16-parity and flavour of a neutral pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the following question may be posed : do the physical characteristics @xmath8 and @xmath9 exist simultaneously and independently without the assumption of the possibility to measure them by some macro - devices ( this is the hypothesis of local realism ) .",
    "usually the terms `` hypothesis of local realism '' and `` concept of macroscopic realism '' are understood as the possibility to describe a physical system in the classical paradigm using some assumptions about the nature of `` classical reality '' .",
    "it might be for example locality or the negligible influence of a measurement device .",
    "all these assumptuons we will call together the `` hypothesis of realism '' by einstein @xcite . it does not make sense to talk about the physical properties of a micro - object without making a statement about the macro - devices used to measure these properties ( this is the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the principle of complementarity of bohr @xcite ) .    a natural ( but probably not unique ) way to write in mathematical terms the condition that a set of physical characteristics of a micro - system exists jointly regardless of the possibility to measure it with a macro - device , is that the joint probability of the set of observables under consideration is non - negative at any time .",
    "for example for the observables @xmath8 and @xmath9 that means that for any elements of the spectra @xmath17 and @xmath18 the probability of simultaneous existence of @xmath19 and @xmath20  the joint probability @xmath21  satisfies the following condition : @xmath22 the assumption of the existence of non - negative joint probabilities ( [ w(ab ) ] ) was implicitly used by bell in his pioneering works @xcite , as the density distribution @xmath23 of hidden variables @xmath24 is a direct corollary of ( [ w(ab ) ] ) .",
    "later bell s idea was developed by clauser , horne , shimony , and holt @xcite .",
    "a historical review of bell s inequalities may be found in @xcite , the idea of the existence of non - negative joint probabilities ( [ w(ab ) ] ) was used by wigner in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the arguments of bell were translated into non - negative joint probabilities for the first time .    in classical physics",
    "the joint probabilities @xmath25 always exist and are well defined for any physical system . in quantum theory if @xmath26 \\ne 0 $ ] , the joint probabilities @xmath21 can not be direcly measured by macro - devices .",
    "however in this case it is possible to use an indirect procedure based on specific properties of entangled states and the notion of an `` element of physical reality '' introduced by einstein .",
    "the `` element of physical reality '' is defined as follows @xcite : _ `` if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.e. , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding lo this physical quantity . ''",
    "_ and _ `` every element of the physical reality must have a counterpart in the physical theory''_. it is obvious that a given element may be identified with some property of a physical system ( for example with a spin projection onto some direction ) and that obtaining information about the element of physical reality differs from obtaining information about some observable only by measurement method . in the first case the measurement is indirect , in the second , direct , and accompanied by a reduction of the state vector or density matrix . because of the above we will not make any distinction in the current paper between the observables and the elements of physical reality .",
    "let us show how the indirect procedure works using the decay of a pseudoscalar meson to a fermion - antifermion pair .",
    "if the decay happens at time @xmath27 through the strong or electromagnetic interaction ( i.e. preserving @xmath28-parity ) , then the pair will be in a spin - singlet bell state @xmath0 .",
    "this fact follows from the general structure of hamiltonians @xmath29 which can be compared with similar decays in quantum field theory ( qft ) . here",
    "@xmath30 is the field of pseudoscalar particles , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are fermionic fields , @xmath33 is divergence , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are effective coupling constants .",
    "let us denote the antifermion with index `` 1 '' and the fermion with index `` 2 '' .",
    "let the spin projections of the fermion and the antifermion onto two directions exist simultaneously or jointly .",
    "note that the directions in space are defined by non - parallel unit vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 , such that the spin projection operators do not commute . for brevity",
    "let us denote the spin @xmath38 projection of fermion @xmath39 onto any axis , specified by unit vector @xmath40 , as @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "then the spin projections at the initial time @xmath27 onto each of the directions in the state @xmath0 satisfy the anticorrelation condition @xmath43 let us denote the spin projection operators of the fermion and antifermion onto direction @xmath36 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 accordingly . similarly @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the spin projection operators onto direction @xmath37 . as the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are non - parallel @xmath48 \\ne 0 , \\quad \\left [ \\hat a^{(2 ) } , \\hat b^{(2)}\\right ] \\ne 0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the same time , according to eberhard s theorem @xcite , @xmath49 = 0 , \\quad \\left [ \\hat a^{(2 ) } , \\hat b^{(1)}\\right ] = 0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equalities ( [ ns - conditions ] ) ensure locality of the quantum theory ( even non - relativistic ) at the level of macro - devices ( so called `` non - signaling conditions '' ) .",
    "the commutation conditions ( [ ns - conditions ] ) allow joint measurement for example of the projection of the fermion spin onto direction @xmath36 and the projection of the antifermion spin onto direction @xmath37 .",
    "hence the joint probability @xmath50 at any time is a well - defined value and it is possible to use for it probability theory based on kolmogorov s axiomatics . here",
    "let us apply to this probability the concept of the elements of physics reality and the anticorrelation condition ( [ pm = mp2 ] ) .",
    "then for the time @xmath27 it is possible to formally introduce the joint probability @xmath52 of the existence of physical characteristics of a microsystem ( in our case  the projection of fermionic spins onto two non - parallel directions @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , corresponding to simultaneously non - measurable observables @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "so , despite condition ( [ no - commuting ] ) , the definition of the element of physical reality allows us to give operational meaning to the joint probability @xmath55 and its analogs .",
    "i.e. , formula ( [ w(ab)physreality ] ) might be considered as a possible expansion of the definition of the joint probability concept to the area where heisenberg s uncertainty principle prevents us from defining such a probability for direct measurements .",
    "it seems logical to assume that bayes theorem can be applied to probabilities like ( [ w(ab)physreality ] ) .    using the concept of local realism , it is possible to derive not only bell- or wigner - like inequalities , but also equalities .",
    "such equalities , often called greenberger-horne-zeilinger ( ghz ) equalities , were introduced in @xcite .",
    "proofs of ghz equalities may be found in @xcite . using the concept of local realism and some additional assumptions ,",
    "a system of equations has been obtained for distinct spin projections of three fermions in the ghz - state @xmath56 .",
    "this system is incompatible with calculations in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .    beginning in 1972 @xcite",
    "there is much experimental evidence of violation of bell s and wigner s inequalities , i.e. evidence of unsoundness of the hypothesis of local realism and/or the concept of elements of physical reality .",
    "however until recently these experiments were not free from some loopholes , which cast doubt on the connection between the violations of bell s or wigner s inequalities and the soundness of the quantum mechanical description of the world .",
    "the first two are the locality loophole ( or communication loophole ) and fair - sampling loophole ( or detection loophole ) .",
    "let us consider the first loophole using the example with fermion - antifermion pairs .",
    "in this case the locality loophole appears due to the fact that during the measurement of the spin projections of each of the particles , the spacetime interval between them is time - like .",
    "hence in the process of measurement it is not possible to exclude a hypothetical exchange of information between macro - devices , which enables a quasi - non - local strong correlation between the two measurements .",
    "such a correlation may lead to the violation of bell s or wigner s inequalities .",
    "the `` locality loophole '' was first overcome in experiments by aspect @xcite using the idea by wheeler @xcite of delayed choice for a pair of two - channel polarizers . in quantum optics",
    "this loophole is closed by `` brute force ''",
    "@xcite , when pairs of correlated photons are separated by a significant distance .",
    "for example in photon experiments with fiber cables this distance is greater than a hundred kilometers @xcite . for spin - correlated fermions",
    "this distance is about 1.3 kilometers @xcite .",
    "when analyzing experiments @xcite one should by definition take into account the limit of the speed of signal exchange between spatially separated subsystems of a correlated quantum system . hence one should use qft where the signal exchange speed is finite , instead of non - relativistic quantum mechanics where this speed is formally infinite @xcite .",
    "the second loophole arises due to the fact that all the detectors have certain registration efficiencies , and hence there is a gedanken possibility to select from the whole set the pairs of correlated particles which lead to the violation of bell s or wigner s inequalities , ignoring the others . for exclusion of the detection loophole in bell s inequalities",
    ", one needs to have efficiency of the detector of the level 2/3 @xcite . in quantum optics",
    "this barrier was overcome only in 2013 @xcite . for wigner",
    "s inequalities the authors are not aware of any papers studying that efficiency value .",
    "the detection loophole should play an important role in particle physics , because typical efficiencies of detectors ( taking into account selection criteria ) do not exceed percents .    up to now",
    ", in each of the experiments for testing bell s inequalities , it was possible to close only one of the two loopholes  either locality or detection ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however in 2015 three successful experiments were conducted ( two with photon pairs @xcite , and one with correlated spins @xmath2 @xcite , which managed to avoid both loopholes .",
    "let us consider another few loopholes that have not been closed by contemporary experiments .",
    "also , as will be shown below , the experimental situation chosen to avoid the locality loophole @xcite , raises questions about applying these experiments to time - independent bell s inequalities @xcite and static wigner s inequalities @xcite .    among the rest of the loopholes ,",
    "the most quoted in the literature the freedom - of - choice loophole @xcite , where due to hidden interactions and unknown parameters an experiment itself causes the observer to select events with stronger correlations . in our opinion",
    "such a loophole is unfalsifiable and hence should not be considered scientifically according to popper s refutability criterion @xcite .",
    "we now consider the `` contextuality loophole '' @xcite , which we believe is as important as the two previously discussed .",
    "let us define `` context '' as the aggregate of all the experimental conditions .",
    "then , in order to obtain the values of correlators in bell s inequalities or joint probabilities in wigner s inequalities , it is necessary to conduct four or three independent experiments .",
    "there is no guarantee that the measurements are conducted under the same conditions . even if one uses the same experimental devices , it is still impossible to repeat exactly all the internal parameters of macro - devices , because , for example , in each of experiments one should select different pairs of spin directions .",
    "i.e. it is impossible to make sure that quantum ensembles of correlated particles are identical in all the experiments .",
    "all the more , if the experiments were conducted in different and non - controllable conditions , their results should not be summed up , subtracted , or compared with each other . if we suppose",
    "that every experiment has its own distribution of probabilities of the observable spectra , then it is possible to obtain a generalized bell s inequality which is never violated in experiment @xcite .    to avoid the contextuality loophole it is necessary to conduct the measurements with an invariable state of the macro - devices , i.e. with only two non - parallel directions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "one can use time as an additional degree of freedom . the same inequality , which potentially allows the experimenters to avoid the contextuality loophole ,",
    "will be introduced in section  [ section : mainbayes ] of this paper .",
    "time - dependent generalizations of static bell s and wigner s inequalities may be justified in another way .",
    "the derivation of these inequalities strongly depends not only on the simultaneous existence of all of the physical characteristics of a micro - system , but also on the assumption of locality both on the macroscopic measurement level ( i.e. eberhard s theorem ) and on the microscopic level ( the hypothesis of local realism ) .",
    "local realism contradicts the mathematical structure of non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( nrqm ) .",
    "because of that , the violation of bell s inequalities is often considered to be experimental proof of the non - locality of quantum theory . however this is not true , as there are two inseparable potential causes of violation of the static bell s and wigner s inequalities : the absence of joint kolmogorov s probabilities for observables , and non - locality on the microscopic level . to exclude the second possibility",
    ", it is necessary to switch to calculations of probabilities and correlators in the framework of qft , which is local on the micro - level by definition , for example because of bogolyubov s principle of microcasuality @xcite .",
    "however in qft it is not possible to use static bell s or wigner s inequalities , because it is not possible to exclude interactions of quantum fields with each other and with vacuum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "i.e. , in qft any particle or system of particles is an open system .",
    "also the description of an entangled quantum system at different spacetime points should take into account relativistic effects , when the finite time of signal propagation between the two parts of the entangled microsystem is beyond the duration of macro - device response .",
    "this is undoubtedly true for @xcite . hence to have the possibility of a theoretical description of locality loophole - free spatially separated experiments it is necessary to include time evolution into any bell - like inequalities to assure their compatibility with the theory of relativity .",
    "the wigner s inequalities are more suited for relativistic generalization , because their intrinsic joint probabilities are well defined both in nrqm and qft .",
    "the correlators in the bell s inequalities are calculated from loop diagrams , part of which calculation depends on the renormalization procedure at each order of perturbation theory .",
    "it is not possible to get a definitive answer which does not depend on a renormalization technique @xcite .",
    "this paper is a logical continuation of a series @xcite in which we have studied possible relativistic corrections for static wigner s inequalities , and then introduced inequalities that generalized static wigner s inequalities for time - dependent ones required in qft .",
    "the main goal of the papers above was testing bohr s complementarity principle in the relativistic domain .",
    "the complementarity principle is directly related to the concept of realism .",
    "we believe that the statement of `` testing the concept of realism '' , most correctly reflects the gist and the results of @xcite . also the connection between the violation of leggett - garg inequalities and the complementarity principle does not appear to be that obvious . in the current paper",
    "we will talk about realism , not complementarity , yet this approach is fully compatible with kolmogorov s axiomatics of probability theory and with the concept of local realism ; it is a particular realization of the supposition of the independent time evolution of every physical ( micro)system . it would be nice to find a time evolution description that does not require the supposition of independence . in section  [ section : mainbayes ] of the current paper we will propose such a description , which may be obtained in the framework of kolmogorov s probability theory using a bayesian approach and operates only with ( conditional ) probabilities .",
    "in addition to the works cited above , there are many proposals to test bell s inequalities in particle physics .",
    "most of these tests use oscillations of neutral pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "they were discussed in the work @xcite .",
    "note also the analysis of the test of static bell s inequalities in neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "time - dependent inequalities were proposed by a.  leggett and a.  garg in their pioneering work @xcite .",
    "the initial goal of this work was for testing whether quantum mechanics may be applied at the macroscopic scale for many - particle quantum systems in a coherent state .",
    "the inequality , which is satisfied by two - times correlators of one observable , assumes that this observable obeys the laws of classical physics ( this is the concept of `` macroscopic realism per se '' .",
    "the expression of the leggett - garg inequalities is similar to the bell s inequalities in form @xcite . because of that the leggett - garg inequalities are sometimes called `` temporal bell inequalities '' @xcite .",
    "this name is not precise , because bell s inequalities involve correlators of various observables at one moment of time , while the leggett - garg inequalities should involve different - time correlators of one observable .",
    "the name `` time - dependent bell s inequalities '' should be attributed to inequalities that contain probabilities or correlators of various observables at different moments of time . following this logic ,",
    "the `` time - dependent wigner s inequalities '' were introduced @xcite .",
    "references to all the key works related to leggett - garg inequalities may be found in the review @xcite .    in 2015",
    "a successful experimental test of violation of the leggett - garg inequalities were conducted : first in an experiment with non - classical movement of a massive quantum particle over a lattice @xcite , and then in a violation of quantum coherence in macroscopic crystals @xcite .    the leggett - garg inequalities may also be used to test for the existence of joint probabilities of observables which have non - commuting operators in nrqm , i.e. to test the hypothesis of realism .",
    "let us note that in the recent publication @xcite authors contested the well - known statement that the leggett - garg inequalities might be applicable to test the principle of macroscopic realism .",
    "but their applicability to test the principle of ( local ) realism is not disputed .",
    "the leggett - garg inequalities may be reproduced if one supposes that some hidden parameters @xmath24 whose probability density @xmath57 depends on time in markov s way , exist in a quantum system @xcite .",
    "such hidden parameters automatically lead to non - negative joint probabilities . while a test of macroscopic coherence requires soft measurements , a test of the existence of the joint probabilities ( i.e. the `` hypothesis of realism '' without the term `` macroscopic '' ) requires the use of sets of parallel measurements , each conducted at only two fixed moments of time @xcite .",
    "this approach related to the methodology of the measurement of four distinct correlators in bell s inequalities , so one might expect that this approach would not be free of the contextuality loophole .",
    "the use of projection measurements and sets of parallel experiments for testing the hypothesis of realism in particle physics is considered in @xcite , where entangled pairs of pseudoscalar mesons are used . in 2016",
    "the neutrino experiment minos reported a test of the leggett - garg inequalities in neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the current paper considers some generic experimental situations where one measures some properties of a physical system ; then constructs a kolmogorov s space of elementary outcomes and introduces into this space events , corresponding to these experimental situations ; we write some relations in terms of conditional probabilities , because they are well - defined in both classical and quantum physics ( in contrast to joint probabilities ) ; and finally we show that corollaries of bayes theorem are violated for correlated quantum systems .",
    "there are many works dedicated to studies of interconnections between the conditional probabilities in quantum and classical theories , starting from fundamental monography by von  neumann @xcite and paper by lders @xcite , where rules for calculating conditional probabilities were introduced .",
    "important generalizations of the notion of the conditional probability on a generalized probability space of quantum mechanics were presented in @xcite . in the current paper",
    "the calculation of conditional probabilities will be based on @xcite .",
    "generalizations of lders rule for non - hermitian projection operators for entangled and open quantum systems were proposed in @xcite . based on this generalization , a quantum - bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics",
    "was developed ( so called qbism ) @xcite , which is now , we believe , is one of the most elegant interpretations of quantum theory .",
    "it provides a unified approach to classical and quantum phenomena .",
    "qbism criticized in @xcite .",
    "a versatile analysis of quantum conditional probability and its relation to classics may be found in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of these works is that von  neumann s formula can not be considered a good generalization of classical conditional probability for quantum phenomena , however there is no doubt in lder s rule @xcite and its extention @xcite .",
    "this paper consists of the following sections . in section  [ section : mainbayes ] , using kolmogorov s approach , conditional probabilities , and bayes theorem , we obtain a static equality and a time - dependent inequality , which allow us to test the hypothesis of realism in time - dependent and open quantum systems . in section  [ section : spininh ]",
    "we use an example of correlated spin-@xmath38 particles in an external stationary and homogeneous magnetic field to demonstrate that in the framework of nrqm for open quantum systems the relations obtained in section  [ section : mainbayes ] are violated .",

    "applicability of formula ( [ neumann_rule ] ) does not require commutation of @xmath7 and @xmath12 .",

    "<S> in this paper we propose a time - independent _ equality _ and time - dependent _ inequality _ , suitable for an experimental test of the hypothesis of realism . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of these relations is based on the concept of conditional probability and on bayes theorem in the framework of kolmogorov s axiomatics of probability theory . </S>",
    "<S> the equality obtained is intrinsically different from the well known ghz - equality and its variants , because violation of the new equality might be tested in experiments with only two microsystems in a maximally entangled bell state @xmath0 , while a test of the ghz - equality requires at least three quantum systems in a special state @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained inequality differs from bell s , wigner s , and leggett - garg inequalities , because it deals with spin @xmath2 projections onto only two non - parallel directions at two different moments of time , while a test of the bell and wigner inequalities requires at least three non - parallel directions , and a test of the leggett - garg inequalities  at least three distinct moments of time . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the proposed inequality seems to allow one to avoid the `` contextuality loophole '' . </S>",
    "<S> violation of the proposed equality and inequality is illustrated with the behaviour of a pair of anti - correlated spins in an external magnetic field and also with the oscillations of flavour - entangled pairs of neutral pseudoscalar mesons . </S>"
