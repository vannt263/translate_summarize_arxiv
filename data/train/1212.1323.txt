    "investigation of biological evolution models @xcite , such as eigen model @xcite and crow - kimura model @xcite , by methods of statistical or theoretical physics is highly fruitful in evolution research .",
    "the methods used include quantum mechanics @xcite , statistical mechanics @xcite-@xcite , quantum field theory @xcite-@xcite,@xcite , hamilton - jacobi equation ( hje ) @xcite .",
    "such approach has given many exact results for evolution models @xcite-@xcite , solved a paradox of the origin of life @xcite , and produced exact finite genome length corrections for the mean fitness and gene probabilities in some evolution models @xcite .    in the original formulation of the eigen and crow - kimura models ,",
    "the configurations of the genome of length @xmath0 are represented by @xmath1 spin configurations @xmath2 , where @xmath3 for @xmath4 take @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "such representation was used by peng , _ et al . _ to study long - range correlation in nucleotide sequences @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 configurations @xmath8 are labelled by @xmath9 and the @xmath10th configuration @xmath8 is assigned a number @xmath11 to represent the reproduction rate or fitness of that configuration and another number @xmath12 to represent the probability in that configurations .",
    "such @xmath12 satisfy the normalization condition : @xmath13 .",
    "the coupled differential equations satisfied by @xmath12 for the crow - kimura model @xcite and eigen model @xcite are given in appendix a and appendix b , respectively .",
    "however , such coupled differential equations are valid only in the limit of infinite population size @xmath14 , which is not the case in many real systems , e.g. virus in a given environment .",
    "thus the study of finite population size problem has attracted much attention in recent decades @xcite-@xcite .",
    "while the case of two alleles ( types of genes ) in the wright - fisher model @xcite and the moran model @xcite can be analytically solved @xcite , the realistic case of evolution with many sequences ( genomes ) stays intractable by traditional methods . in @xcite",
    "the additive fitness landscape has been considered , when the contributions of different alleles to the fitness are random numbers and in @xcite a finite population was considered in which the finesses of different sequences are independent random numbers .    the purpose of the present letter is to formulate crow - kimura model and eigen model for finite population size and solve them for the single peak fitness landscape , popular in quasispecies literature .",
    "in such a landscape , the fitness of a configuration , say @xmath15 , is larger than fitness of other configurations , i.e. @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and all @xmath11 are equal for @xmath18 .",
    "we first formulate the iteration procedure for the finite population models , then derive hje to describe the dynamic of the probability distribution .",
    "the steady state solution of hje gives the variance of the mean fitness .",
    "our results are useful for understanding population sizes of virus in which the coupled differential equations can give reliable results for biological evolution problems .",
    "our results are exact derivations , versus numerics or uncontrolled approximations in vast majority of finite population articles .",
    "consider the case when the total number of different genotypes @xmath19 is either @xmath20 , where @xmath0 is the number of nucleotides in the virus genome , or @xmath21 , where @xmath0 is the number of two type of alleles or ( spins ) , located in different places ( loci ) .",
    "the infinite population case is when the population size @xmath14 is large enough to have large number of viruses of any type .",
    "the convergence of evolutionary dynamics with population size depends on the mutation rate and the fitness landscape . in the infinite population limit",
    "the evolution equations are deterministic , and , for molecular evolution models @xcite-@xcite , there are many exact results @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is possible even to find exact solutions for the steady state and dynamics @xcite . in biology ,",
    "the populations are often relatively small",
    ". then the collective characteristics of the evolving population will fluctuate .",
    "we consider the symmetric fitness landscape , popular in virology .",
    "the genome is a collection of letters ( spins ) @xmath22 , denoting the alleles type .",
    "thus a sequence is identified with a spin configuration of a one - dimensional ising model . by mutation",
    "any letter may randomly change to the other value .",
    "an important characteristics of the sequence space is the number of neighbors @xmath0 and the number of sequences at the hamming distance @xmath23 ( sequences have @xmath23 alleles different from the reference sequence ) @xmath24 for two loci case at @xmath25 .",
    "we consider a simple fitness landscape , popular in population genetics , when the sequence from the @xmath26-th hamming class has a fitness @xmath27 .",
    "as evolution is a stochastic process , we should work with probabilities .",
    "we are interested in steady state properties of the evolution model .",
    "we consider the finite population version of crow - kimura model , see the appendix . in this case",
    "we consider the evolution as a markov process , where the state ( the state of the population is characterized by the number of individuals for the different possible numbers of mutations ) is defined by @xmath28 integers , the numbers of different hamming types . during one evolution step ,",
    "there are three processes : birth of new individuals proportional to the fitness of the corresponding hamming class , transitions between hamming classes proportional to @xmath29 to the lower hamming class and transitions proportional to @xmath30 to the higher hamming class @xcite .",
    "these factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been derived in @xcite for the infinite population models , and should be applied to the discrete time scheme of the finite population models as well . the iteration step is completed by the random reduction of the population to the initial size , @xmath14 .",
    "this evolution dynamics described here corresponds to the moran model with many alleles .",
    "compared to the ordinary multi - allele moran model @xcite , in our case there is a non - trivial geometry in sequence space , defined by hamming distance .",
    "we first define our model for the case of a general symmetric fitness landscape with wrightian fitness @xmath31 in the @xmath26-th hamming class , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the fitness defined earlier . here",
    "the average number of mutations of genome per one replication period is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a mutation rate per genome in the continuous - time parallel model , and @xmath36 is the time step . at any moment the state of our model is characterized via @xmath28 integers @xmath37 .",
    "we choose @xmath38 , therefore @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the @xmath40 limit . in this case",
    "the steady state results and dynamics are @xmath41 independent ( u gives just the scale ) .    during the iteration step we consider the following processes :    * a. random growth with @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 is a random binomial process with probability @xmath44 and @xmath37 trials . *",
    "b. mutations .",
    "+ there are @xmath45 forward mutations from the class _ l_. + we consider random integer number @xmath45 with binomial distribution with the probability parameter @xmath46 and @xmath37 trials",
    ". there are @xmath47 back mutations from the class _ l_. + we consider random integer number @xmath47 with binomial distribution with the probability parameter @xmath48 and @xmath37 trials . due to back mutations we have the following change of @xmath37 : @xmath49 . *",
    "c. we randomly remove @xmath50 individuals from the population to keep a fixed population size .",
    "consider the wrightian fitness with @xmath51 for the peak sequence , @xmath52 is the number of mutations per generation , @xmath53 is a fitness gap in the corresponding continuous - time parallel selection - mutation model , and @xmath54 for @xmath18 .",
    "our goal is to investigate how the mean fitness depends on finite population size .    in case of infinite population",
    ", one can calculate the number of viruses with the peak sequence using a single equation , with the @xmath55 accuracy .",
    "assume that there is some probability distribution @xmath56 for the number @xmath57 of viruses with the peak sequence , which satisfies the normalization condition @xmath58 .",
    "then we can derive both the steady state distribution , which is a rather simple function , and even the exact dynamics , which is a complicated expression for the @xmath56 .",
    "we consider a discrete time scheme of evolution with small @xmath41 . during each iteration",
    "we consider the steps a , b , c. in step a , there are @xmath59 new viruses at the peak sequence .",
    "the number @xmath59 is derived via a binomial @xmath57 sampling with a small probability @xmath60 . during the step c of reduction to keep a constant population size anyone of this @xmath59 viruses could be removed from the system .",
    "the total number of removed viruses from the peak sequence @xmath61 is calculated via binomial distribution with @xmath62 trials and the probability @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the result of a and c steps should be a sampling of @xmath57 particles with a probability @xmath64 .",
    "thus after steps a and c the original @xmath57 changes as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 has a binomial distribution with a probability parameter @xmath67 , and the number of trials is @xmath57 . during the step b of mutation , @xmath68 , where @xmath61 has a binomial distribution with a probability parameter @xmath41 and the number of trials is @xmath57 . thus after one iteration @xmath69 .",
    "if we have a distribution @xmath70 at the @xmath71-th moment of time , then after an iteration with the period of time @xmath41 we have a distribution : @xmath72 when the averaging is over the ( binomial ) distributions of @xmath66 and @xmath61 .",

    "( [ e2]),([e8 ] ) , and the expression for the variance eq.([e10 ] ) .    equation ( [ e10 ] ) is verified numerically in fig . 1 for @xmath92 .",
    "one could follow the method used in @xcite to solve eq .",
