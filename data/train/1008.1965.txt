    "the loewner equation @xcite is an important result in the theory of univalent functions @xcite that has found important applications in nonlinear dynamics , statistical physics , and conformal field theory @xcite . in its most basic formulation , the loewner equation is a first - order differential equation for the conformal mapping @xmath0 from a given ` physical domain , ' consisting of a complex region @xmath1 minus a curve @xmath2 emanating from its boundary , onto a ` mathematical domain ' represented by @xmath1 itself .",
    "usually , @xmath1 is either the upper half - plane or the exterior of the unit circle , but recently the loewner equation for the channel geometry was also considered @xcite .",
    "the loewner equation depends on a driving function , here called @xmath3 , that is the image of the growing tip under the mapping @xmath0 .",
    "an important development on the theory of the loewner equation was the discovery by schramm @xcite that when the driving function @xmath3 is a brownian motion the resulting loewner evolution describes the scaling limit of certain statistical mechanics models .",
    "this result spurred great interest in the so - called stochastic loewner equation @xcite .",
    "recently , the deterministic loewner equation was also used to study the problem of laplacian fingered growth in both the half - plane and radial geometries @xcite as well as in the channel geometry @xcite . in this case , the driving function @xmath3 has to follow a specific time evolution in order to ensure that the finger tip grows along the gradient lines of the corresponding laplacian field .",
    "the idea of using iterated conformal maps to generate aggregates was first deployed by hastings and levitov @xcite in the context of stochastic growth models , such as diffusion limited aggregation ; see , e.g. , @xcite for further developments along those lines .",
    "a deterministic version of the hastings - levitov model that is closely related to the loewner - equation approach  albeit not using explicitly such a formalism  was studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of laplacian growth within the context of the loewner evolution , and present a new method of deriving the corresponding loewner equation for a broad class of growth models in the half - plane .",
    "our method is based on the schwarz - christoffel ( sc ) transformation between the mathematical planes @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an infinitesimal time interval . more specifically , the method consists of expanding the integrand of the sc formula in powers of the appropriate infinitesimal quantity ( related to @xmath6 ) and then performing the integrals up to the leading - order term .",
    "our method correctly yields the loewner evolution for the case of slit - like fingers studied before @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the method is able to handle more general growth problems , so long as the growth rule can be specified ( in the mathematical plane ) in terms of a polygonal curve , in which case the schwarz - christoffel transformation can be used .",
    "an example is given for the case of a bubble growing from the real axis into the upper half - plane .",
    "in order to set the stage for the remainder of the paper , we wish to begin our discussion by considering the simplest loewner evolution , namely , that in which a curve starts from the real axis at @xmath7 and then grows into the upper half-@xmath8-plane @xmath9 , where @xmath10 the curve at time @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 and its growing tip is labeled by @xmath13 .",
    "now let @xmath0 be the conformal mapping that maps the ` physical domain , ' corresponding to the upper half-@xmath8-plane minus the curve @xmath2 , onto the upper half - plane of an auxiliary complex @xmath14-plane , called the ` mathematical plane , ' i.e. , we have @xmath15 , where @xmath16 with the curve tip @xmath13 being mapped to a point @xmath3 on the real axis in the @xmath14-plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig . 1 . ] .",
    "furthermore , we consider the growth process to be such that the accrued portion of the curve from @xmath11 to @xmath17 , where @xmath6 is an infinitesimal time interval , is mapped under @xmath18 to a vertical slit in the mathematical @xmath14-plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig . 1 . ] .",
    "the mapping function @xmath0 must also satisfy the initial condition @xmath19 since we start with an empty upper half - plane .",
    "we also impose the so - called hydrodynamic normalization condition at infinity : @xmath20 these conditions specify uniquely the mapping function @xmath0 .",
    "-plane and the mathematical @xmath14- and @xmath21-planes at times @xmath11 and @xmath17 , respectively , for a single finger in the upper half - plane .",
    "the mapping @xmath4 maps the curve @xmath22 ( at time @xmath11 ) onto a segment of the real axis on the @xmath14-plane , whereas the accrued portion of the curve ( during time interval @xmath6 ) is mapped to a vertical slit .",
    "the mapping @xmath23 is obtained as the composition of @xmath5 and the slit mapping @xmath24 ; see text.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    from a more physical viewpoint , the problem formulated above belong to the class of laplacian growth models where an interface evolves between two phases driven by a scalar field @xmath25 , representing , for example , temperature , pressure , or concentration , depending on the physical problem at hand . in one phase , initially occupying the entire upper half - plane , the scalar field @xmath26 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath27 whereas in the other phase one considers @xmath26=const .",
    ", say @xmath28 , with the curve @xmath2 representing a finger - like advancing interface between the two phases .",
    "( here the finger is assumed to be infinitesimally thin . ) the complex potential for the problem can then be defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the function harmonically conjugated to @xmath26 . on the boundary of the physical domain ,",
    "consisting here of the real axis together with the curve @xmath2 , we impose the condition @xmath28 , whereas at infinity we assume a uniform gradient field , @xmath31 , or alternatively , @xmath32 from this point of view , the mapping function @xmath18 introduced above corresponds precisely to the complex potential @xmath33 of the problem .",
    "in particular , the fact that in the @xmath14-plane the curve grows along a vertical line implies that the finger tip grows along gradient lines in the @xmath8-plane . to specify completely a given physical model ,",
    "one has also to prescribe the interface velocity , which is usually taken to be proportional to some power @xmath34 of the gradient field : @xmath35 . for most of the problems considered here",
    "the specific velocity model is not relevant , in the sense that the finger shapes will be independent of the exponent @xmath34 , which only affects the time scale of the problem .",
    "( however , there are situations , such as the case of competing asymmetrical fingers @xcite , where different @xmath34 s may yield different patterns . )    for convenience of notation , we shall represent the mathematical plane at time @xmath17 as the complex @xmath21-plane and so we write @xmath36 .",
    "now consider the mapping @xmath37 , from the upper half-@xmath21-plane onto the mathematical domain in the @xmath14-plane ; see fig .",
    "[ fig . 1 . ] .",
    "the mapping function @xmath38 can then be given in terms of @xmath18 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the inverse of @xmath41 .",
    "the above relation governs the time evolution of the function @xmath0 and naturally leads to the loewner equation . a standard way of showing this is to construct the slit mapping @xmath41 explicitly , substitute its inverse in ( [ eq:1 ] ) , and then take the limit @xmath42 .",
    "one then finds the loewner equation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the so - called growth factor which is related to the tip velocity .",
    "one can show @xcite that @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the inverse of @xmath18 . here",
    ", however , the specific form of @xmath44 is not relevant since we can always rescale the time coordinate in ( [ loewner ] ) so as to set @xmath47 . from symmetry , one also gets @xmath48 so that @xmath49 const . , which implies that the tip @xmath13 simply traces out a vertical line in the @xmath8-plane .    in more general situations , such as the case of multiple fingers ,",
    "the function @xmath41 can no longer be obtained in closed form and so one has to resort to alternative approaches to derive the loewner evolution .",
    "previous methods @xcite consider a series of compositions of the basic one - slit mapping . here , however , we will apply a more direct method based on the schwarz - christoffel transformation to obtain the loewner equation for slit - like fingers in the half - plane . in the next section , our method will be extended to treat the case of a growing bubble in the upper half - plane . to illustrate how the method works ,",
    "let us first use it to derive the loewner equation ( [ loewner ] ) for a single finger .",
    "we begin by inverting ( [ eq:1 ] ) so as to write @xmath50 the mapping @xmath41 from the upper half-@xmath21-plane onto the upper half-@xmath14-plane with a vertical slit ( see fig .  [ fig",

    "[ we remark parenthetically that in writing ( [ eq:8 ] ) we have assumed , for simplicity , that the slits in the @xmath14-plane are mapped under @xmath66 onto symmetrical segments on the real @xmath21-axis ; see fig  [ fig .",

    "this is valid only in the limit that the slit heights become vanishingly small , that is , when @xmath42 , which is the relevant limit for us here . ]",
    "the integral in ( [ eq:8 ] ) can not be performed exactly for arbitrary @xmath62 , hence in order to obtain the loewner equation for this case we first need to expand the integrand in powers of the infinitesimal parameters @xmath67 and then proceed with the integration .",
    "note , however , that each term in ( [ eq:8 ] ) is of the same form as that appearing in ( [ dois ] ) for the case of a single finger .",
    "we can thus build upon our experience with that case to treat the present situation .",
    "in particular , we notice that the mixed terms involving different @xmath67 s in the expansion of the integrand in ( [ eq:8 ] ) are all of orders higher than @xmath55 and hence need not be considered , for they do not contribute to the final result in the limit @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath73    if the growth factors @xmath74 are all the same , we can again rescale the time variable so as to set @xmath75 .",
