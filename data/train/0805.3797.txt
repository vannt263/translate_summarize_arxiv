    "this magneto - optic polarization rotation can be used for sensitive alkali - vapor magnetometry  @xcite , and has been the subject of several recent studies in a variety of cold atom samples  @xcite . when applied to localized cold atom ensembles",
    ", the result can be sensitive magnetometry with linear spatial resolution of a few tens of microns  @xcite .",
    "these magnetic microscopes could be of use for imaging fields near a variety of surfaces , including integrated circuits  @xcite and atom chips designed for cold atom interferometry  @xcite . at a more fundamental level ,",
    "faraday spectroscopy has also been considered for searches of atomic electric dipole moments ( edm )  @xcite and for nondestructive quantum state estimation and preparation  @xcite .",
    "such measurements benefit from large atom numbers , long interrogation times , and `` field - free '' confinement , _ i.e. _ confinement in which the trapping potential minimally perturbs the measurement .",
    "a simple way to achieve field - free conditions for a cold atom sample is to release the atoms from a trap and probe them during freefall .",
    "a drawback of this is that the maximum interrogation time is limited to a few tens of milliseconds as the atom cloud falls away from the interaction region .",
    "isayama _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite reported a faraday signal from atoms in freefall with a 1/@xmath2 decay time of 11 ms .",
    "this limitation has been overcome by confining the atoms to the antinodes of a red - detuned optical lattice in which one of the lattice beams also serves as a probe beam  @xcite . when the atoms were held in the intensity nodes of a blue - detuned lattice , dark - field confinement was achieved , although the signal was reduced because the interaction with the probe was correspondingly diminished .    by confining atoms in a blue - detuned trap , however , it is possible to achieve the simultaneous conditions of long interrogation time , low - field confinement , and large atom - number  @xcite .",
    "blue - detuned traps produce lower light shifts and photon scattering rates than red - detuned traps , enabling deep , large volume traps with low power requirements .",
    "although these traps have been proposed for use in magnetometry  @xcite and edm searches  @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , no experimental demonstrations have been performed .    in this paper , we report the use of dark optical traps to confine atoms in a submillimeter , box - like volume for dynamic magnetometry using faraday spectroscopy .",
    "the traps are formed from crossed , high - charge - number hollow laser beams  @xcite .",
    "by repetitively spin - polarizing the confined sample , we extend the measurement time from only a few milliseconds to @xmath1400 ms in a single loading cycle with up to 1 khz sampling rate .",
    "we demonstrate the technique by measuring and compensating ambient time - varying magnetic fields , such as those arising from eddy currents and the ac power line .",
    "we also show that nonlinear spin dynamics due to the probe beam  @xcite are preserved in these traps .",

    "the hollow beams for our trap are formed by modifying the wavefront phase of a gaussian beam with a reflective spatial light modulator ( slm ) .",
    "slms have found increasing value in cold atom manipulation experiments because of their ability to control trap parameters in a programmable manner and to produce traps with nontrivial intensity profiles  @xcite . the applied phase for the hollow beams used here has a profile @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are cylindrical coordinates and @xmath7 is an integer . the second term is a lens function of focal length @xmath8 mm to focus the beam of wavelength @xmath9 onto the atom sample .",
    "for high charge number beams ( @xmath10 ) , we usually operate the trap a few centimeters away from the focal plane , where aberrations are reduced and the peak intensity is maximum  @xcite .    the light for the hollow beam is derived from a tunable extended cavity diode laser .",

    "[ fig : longscan]a .",
    "the envelope over all larmor precession signals decays with a 1/@xmath2 time constant of @xmath45 ms .",

    "the signal displays two dominant sources of time - dependence .",
    "first , the exponential decay occurs from the metal vacuum chamber , which develops eddy currents when the mot coils are extinguished . due to the symmetry of our chamber , the eddy currents are along the axis of the mot coils ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the bias field of @xmath55khz for these measurements is also on the @xmath44-axis so that the eddy current field adds linearly to the bias field .",
    "the second source of time - dependent behavior is ambient ac magnetic fields in the room arising from power supply transformers , power strips , etc .",
    "we note that our experiment is triggered off the ac power line . we found that this field is also primarily along the @xmath44-axis , because the amplitude of the oscillation signal is independent of this bias field .",
    "an orthogonal component would add in quadrature and cause the amplitude to vary with the bias field .",
    "additionally , an orthogonal , oscillating magnetic field component added in quadrature would show up at twice its oscillation frequency .",
    "since the larmor frequencies retrieved from faraday spectroscopy determine the scalar magnetic field , full vector information is not acquired in a single shot , but can be acquired through multiple measurements  @xcite .",
    "some information about magnetic field orientation can be obtained directly from the polarimeter signal ( e.g. there is no spin precession if the @xmath29 field is parallel to the optical pumping axis ) , but that effect is outside the scope of this work .    for many applications , control over the magnetic field is required to sub - mg levels , especially those involving raman transitions between magnetically sensitive states  @xcite . as a simple application of the long measurement time capability , we demonstrate compensation of these time varying fields .",
    "we first compensate the effects of eddy currents , which produce an exponentially decaying magnetic field at the atom sample .",

    "the appropriate time variation is done by low - pass filtering of a step function whose amplitude is adjusted for optimum compensation . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : larmorfrequency]a ( dotted line ) .",
    "although this source of time variation is not canceled perfectly , the field beyond 25 ms is constant to within the 60 hz field amplitude .",
    "the ambient ac magnetic fields are primarily due to 60 hz power line sources . by triggering our experiment from the power line ,",
    "this source of magnetic field variation is reproducible and can be compensated . without this triggering , the variations of a few mg observed in fig .",

    "[ fig : larmorfrequency]b , we show frequency spectrum of the magnetic field , which clearly shows higher harmonics at 180 , 300 , and 420 hz .",
    "we suppressed the 60 hz component by a factor of 20 . with appropriate signal processing , the field measurements in our setup",

    "[ fig : longscan]).,width=302 ]    for any trap depth , there is a trade - off between snr and the number of possible field measurements allowed before the signal decays .",
    "snr improves by increasing the number of atoms that are optically pumped or by decreasing the pump detuning  @xcite , but these approaches also boil the atoms out of the trap more quickly . for most of our results presented here , we only weakly pumped the atoms to reduce heating and to increase the number of optical pumping cycles we could achieve . in general",
    ", the dominant heating will occur from the @xmath67s optical pumping phase of each cycle , during which several photons are scattered . as a rough estimate , the timescale for signal decay should be on the order of the time required for the average atom energy to equal the trap depth .",
