    "when squeezed , the single photon ceases to be a single quantum particle and it becomes a superposition in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space . as such , it gains many useful abilities exploited in the various quantum protocols @xcite , but its description and , consequently , analysis becomes more involved .",
    "however , we can greatly benefit from the well - known similarity between squeezed single photons and superposed coherent states @xcite .",
    "if we are able to rigorously confirm that a single photon was transformed into a high - quality css and that a css was transformed back into a high - quality single photon , we can safely claim that the squeezing operation works as intended and that it should have its potential place in future applications .      in order to quantitatively",
    "assess the transition between the single photon and the css , we employ the following figures of merit .",
    "first , note that the ideal initial and target states , the fock state @xmath45 and the coherent - state superposition @xmath46 , become identical when @xmath47 .",
    "hence the usual measure of fidelity between the experimentally generated states and an ideal state @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is not a useful figure of merit .",
    "for example , the overlap between the experimental @xmath50 and a target css , @xmath51 would optimally attain a value close to the maximal value of unity .",
    "this can be achieved when the state @xmath50 approaches an ideal css with amplitude @xmath22 , but also when @xmath50 is close to @xmath45 for @xmath47 . in order to avoid such a confusion between our particle - like and wave - like states and to gain a better insight into",
    "each generated state s properties , we divide the fidelity into two separate measures : the coherent - state distinguishability factor , @xmath52 , and the coherent - state interference factor , @xmath53 .    here , @xmath54 describes the average overlap of the investigated state @xmath50 with an independent pair of coherent states with amplitudes @xmath55 , which form the ideal superposition .",
    "when @xmath56 , this overlap vanishes for our odd - number css , while it would become unity for an even - number css , @xmath57 . in either case , as well as for an incoherent mixture of coherent states",
    "@xmath58 , @xmath54 has , ideally , two separated symmetric peaks with maxima approaching @xmath59 when @xmath60 . on the other hand",
    ", the single - photon state @xmath45 has a maximal distinguishability @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "an additional feature separating the css from the single - photon state is that the distinguishability of @xmath45 is phase - insensitive , @xmath63 , whereas for both the ideal and the experimentally generated csss , it is not , having a maximum at @xmath64 .",
    "besides two separated coherent - state peaks in phase space , a css is characterized by interference between the coherent states . for the wigner function",
    ", this interference gives a negativity at the phase - space origin .",
    "however , a single - photon state exhibits the same feature , and if we want to distinguish a css from a single - photon state , we must evaluate the difference in this interference . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the interference factor @xmath65 , which is always positive for a balanced mixture of coherent states and always negative for both the single - photon and the css @xmath66 .",
    "this makes it useful for demonstrating nonclassical interference effects .",
    "however , this figure of merit achieves more .",
    "while it has a clear minimum for the single - photon state , @xmath67 at @xmath68 , for the ideal css , its extremal value depends on the amplitude @xmath22 and this value monotonically decreases to @xmath69 as @xmath22 increases .",
    "although both for the ideal single - photon state and the ideal css , the distinguishability and the interference are related by @xmath70 , in the presence of realistic noise , this symmetry relation is broken and we benefit from treating the two quantities independently .",
    "two benchmarks can be derived to demonstrate that we observe nontrivial interference effects in comparison to the classical theory .",
    "the first benchmark represents the interference achievable purely by a mixture of coherent states . passing it is a first witness of non - classical interference .",
    "the second benchmark , obtained through optimization over all possible mixtures of gaussian states , then serves as a witness of higher - order non - classical interference .",
    "once again we stress that these criteria are different from simply observing negativities , which is always a witness of non - classicality , but does not discriminate between a css and a single - photon state like our interference factor @xmath65 does . in order to verify the single photon - to - css transition in our experiment",
    ", we employ @xmath54 in order to describe the emergence of the two coherent - state peaks in the css . at the same time , @xmath65 enables us to rule out incoherent mixtures and verify the presence of non - classical interference .    for the css - to - single photon transition",
    ", we introduce an additional figure of merit , since any loss of phase properties in @xmath54 and @xmath65 ( as a possible indication for a successful conversion into a single - photon state ) may as well be explained by an incoherent dephasing . in order to describe this reverse transition from the css back to the single - photon state",
    ", we take advantage of an important feature of the ideal single - photon state  it is indivisible at a beam splitter .",
    "this property , which has been essential in many single - photon experiments , can be evaluated through the so - called anti - correlation factor @xmath71 ( ref .",
    "this operational measure is obtained assuming that the state in question is split at a balanced beam splitter and the two output modes are measured by realistic single - photon detectors .",
    "the anti - correlation parameter is then @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the probability for both detectors registering a photon , while @xmath74 is the probability for only one detector registering a photon ( independent of the other detector ) .",
    "for a mixture of a single - photon and a vacuum state , @xmath75 , the anti - correlation parameter is @xmath76 , while classical light always has @xmath77 . as the amplitude of the ideal odd css increases , @xmath78^{-2}$ ] grows from zero , approaching unity . for the ideal squeezed single - photon state ,",
    "@xmath71 increases monotonously with the squeezing and for @xmath79 , @xmath71 becomes larger than unity , thus confirming the loss of the single - photon character .",
    "the phase - insensitive superposition of coherent states present in a single - photon state , @xmath80 , is a typical manifestation of wave - particle duality  even in the supposedly particle - like state @xmath45 , wave - like coherent states are present , but these form a continuous superposition with arbitrary phases and hence are not visible in the total state .",
    "however , in a @xmath20 @xmath81 css conversion , the squeezer can break this rotational symmetry and amplify coherent states along a single axis , thus making them more distinguishable while simultaneously preserving their interference features .",
    "this is demonstrated in suppl .",
    "[ fig_suppl1 ] , where we can see that squeezing not only increases distinguishability ( which could as well be a consequence of gaussian noise ) , but also shifts the maximum of @xmath54 towards larger values of @xmath82 , as one would expect from a larger css . at the same time , the minimum of @xmath65 is also shifted , thus preserving the symmetry of an ideal css while remaining negative and distinct from a mixture of coherent states .",
    "the weakest squeezing operation ( @xmath83 ) even exhibits interference properties going beyond those of any gaussian state . at the same time , in suppl .",
    "[ fig_suppl2 ] , we can observe a phase modulation of @xmath65 which emerges as a consequence of the phase - sensitive squeezing process .",
    "for the opposite conversion , css @xmath81 @xmath20 , the above criteria are ambiguous , because the transitions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 and their loss of the phase dependence can be as well explained by an incoherent dephasing effect . however , by looking at the anti - correlation parameter @xmath71 , which effectively serves as a measure of the ` single - photon ' quality of the state , we see that the values of this parameter change from @xmath86 to @xmath87 . recalling that for an ideal single - photon state we have @xmath88 , this shows that the quality of the single - photon state present in the total state is enhanced , even though the absolute single - photon fraction in the resulting mixed state is actually reduced .",
    "as a fundamental light source , we utilize a continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser with a wavelength of @xmath89  nm .",
    "some part of the fundamental wave is converted to a second harmonic wave in order to pump the optical parametric oscillators ( opo-1 and 2 ) . as a non - classical input state ,",
    "we generate single - photon states , or , alternatively , coherent - state superpositions ( csss ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] of the main text , the setup for creating these input states is visualized by an orange background .",
    "compared to the setups of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , in the present scheme , we can switch between the two different non - classical input states . in the case of a @xmath20 input ,",
    "non - degenerate photon pairs are generated in opo-1 and one photon of every pair is then detected by an avalanche photo diode ( apd ) .",
    "a click of the apd at this arm heralds the presence of a single photon in the other arm . the separating cavity ( sc ) behind opo-1 allows for a spatial separation of each pair of correlated photons .",
    "the filtering cavities ( fcs ) extract a single frequency mode of opo-1 from hundreds of modes in every @xmath90  mhz of the hundreds ghz bandwidth of quasi - phase - matching , where @xmath90  mhz is the free spectral range of opo-1 . for the case of an initial css",
    ", opo-1 generates degenerate photon pairs , i.e. , squeezed vacuum states .",
    "every click of the apd then corresponds to the subtraction of a photon i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "our measurement - based squeezer works as follows ( visualized by a blue background in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] of the main text ) @xcite .",
    "an ancillary @xmath16-squeezed state and the input quantum state are coupled by a beam splitter , where the level of squeezing @xmath33 can be adjusted by the beam - splitting ratio @xmath2 with @xmath92 .",
    "we demonstrate three different squeezing levels , @xmath33 @xmath93 @xmath94 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , corresponding to @xmath2 @xmath93 @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "then , one output of the beam splitter is measured with respect to the @xmath15 quadrature and the outcome is fedforward to the @xmath15 quadrature of the other output mode . a negative squeezing parameter _",
    "e.g.  _ @xmath36 is achieved by @xmath97 rotations of the optical phases , corresponding to an @xmath15-squeezed ancilla , a measurement with respect to @xmath16 , and a feedforward on @xmath16 .",
    "the feedforward operation is performed as follows .",
    "first , a phase modulation is added to an auxiliary beam by means of an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) , where the applied voltage is proportional to the measurement result .",
    "then , the auxiliary beam is coupled to the signal beam by a highly asymmetric beam splitter .",
    "an optical delay of @xmath3  m in free space is utilized for a broadband synchronization of the feedforward @xcite .",
    "thus , we achieve broadband squeezing of up to @xmath98  mhz , which is @xmath99 times broader than the conventional squeezing @xcite .",
    "note that the bandwidth limitation is that of the ancillary squeezed light .",
    "the bandwidth is broad enough to operate a full @xmath100  mhz bandwidth of the heralded quantum states , where @xmath100  mhz is the half - width - half - maximum of opo-1 .    in a preliminary experiment ,",
    "the squeezing level of the ancilla squeezed vacuum state was @xmath101 db , while the antisqueezing level was @xmath102 db .",
    "the finite squeezing level of the ancilla causes some excess noise at the output of the squeezing gate , while the antisqueezing level of the ancilla does , in principle , not have any effect on the output , as will be explained below .",
    "phase fluctuations in the delay line can have the negative effect of degrading the squeezing level of the ancilla , because a part of the antisqueezed quadrature noise disturbs the conjugate squeezing quadrature .",
    "however , in our experiment , the phase fluctuations are sufficiently suppressed by a feedback control to the level of a few degrees .",
    "in addition , the beam pointing in the delay line is also actively controlled in the experiment via feedback , by which a significant decrease of the interference visibility can be prevented during the experiment . the beam pointing control is implemented through a combination of a four - quarter photodiode ( to detect misalignments ) and a mirror mount attached to three piezoelectric actuators ( to compensate misalignments ) .",
    "as for the high - purity single - photon state with a single - photon component of @xmath43 used as the input state , among the remaining inefficiencies of @xmath103 , the inefficiencies due to the detection process are estimated to be about @xmath104 .",
    "the measured optical propagation losses inside and outside the opo are @xmath105 in total .",
    "the contribution of fake signals from the apd corresponds to @xmath106 .",
    "higher photon number components are about @xmath107 .      an input state to be squeezed",
    "is represented by its quadrature operators @xmath108 , while an ancilla squeezed vacuum state is represented by @xmath109 .",
    "a linear transformation of these quadrature operators in the heisenberg representation uniquely represents the gaussian gate operation .",
    "if we want to squeeze the @xmath15 quadrature , we choose the ancilla state to be an @xmath15-squeezed state , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a quadrature operator of a vacuum state and @xmath113 is a squeezing parameter .",
    "next , we measure @xmath114 , and then perform a displacement operation on the remaining state along the direction of the @xmath16 quadrature by an amount proportional to the measurement outcome , corresponding to the transformation @xmath115 and @xmath116 , leading to      as can be seen above , the ancilla s antisqueezed noise is canceled by the feedforward operation , and only the squeezed quadrature of the ancilla remains as an extra term . in the limit @xmath118 , this extra term becomes negligibly small , and the overall transformation approaches an ideal squeezing operation @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "similarly , if we want to squeeze the @xmath16 quadrature , we choose the ancilla state to be a @xmath16-squeezed state , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is a quadrature operator of a vacuum state .",
    "this time we measure @xmath123 and then perform a displacement operation on the remaining state along the direction of the @xmath15 quadrature , corresponding to the transformation @xmath124 and @xmath125 , this time resulting in        all the elements of this squeezing gate , i.e. , the creation of an ancilla squeezed vacuum state , the beam splitter interaction , the homodyne detection , and the feedforward displacement operation , are each realizable in an unconditional and deterministic fashion , and hence the squeezing gate as a whole also works unconditionally and deterministically .",
    "the only imperfection is the excess noise in the squeezed quadrature due to the finite ancilla squeezing ."

    "<S> @xcite makes use of quantum particle detections ( i.e. , photon counting ) and quantum wave evolutions ( i.e. , quantum interferences through passive , energy - preserving linear optical circuits ) . in this scheme , however , the required ancilla states consist of many highly entangled photons and thus are out of reach of current experimental capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore reasonable to extend the toolbox of optical quantum operations in order to reduce the cost of the necessary quantum resources . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , apart from discrete ` click by click ' measurements that rely on the particle - like nature of light @xcite , quantum light fields may be detected more naturally via continuous phase - space measurements exploiting their wave - like features @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , two recent continuous - variable teleportation experiments on non - gaussian input states , using gaussian entanglement and gaussian homodyne measurements , demonstrate that not only a wave - like coherent - state superposition ( css ) @xcite , but also a particle - like photonic qubit @xcite can be transferred efficiently and reliably , preserving the negativity of the wigner function and exceeding the classical fidelity limits , respectively .    in order to further investigate the potential of such _ hybrid _ schemes @xcite , which simultaneously exploit discrete and continuous techniques for encoding , measuring , and processing quantum states of light , it is desirable , besides gaussian measurements and resource states , to also add gaussian gate operations to the set of possible optical elements for processing photonic qubits . indeed , one feasible regime of single - photon operations has still remained unexplored : gaussian operations including _ active squeezers _ , still linearly transforming the mode operators , but no longer preserving energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing operation has been traditionally associated with continuous - variable quantum optics and information @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it can be considered the essential , elementary operation of this area , as it is a necessary component of all gaussian gates @xcite and even some non - gaussian gates require it for their implementation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of a genuine squeezing _ gate _ is fundamentally different from simply preparing a particular squeezed _ </S>",
    "<S> state_. this basic difference was previously addressed in an experiment employing a measurement - based protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , this scheme was extended to more advanced gaussian gates by using the squeezers @xcite as their fundamental building blocks : a quantum nondemolition sum gate @xcite , which may be understood as a continuous - variable version of the controlled - not gate for qubits , and a reversible phase - insensitive amplification ( two - mode squeezing ) gate @xcite , which also functions as an approximate cloner for coherent - state inputs . however , in all these previous demonstrations , only gaussian states have been used for the inputs . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for this is of technical nature : the bandwidth of the squeezing gate is typically very narrow and there has been no way so far to generate highly non - classical , non - gaussian states in such a narrow frequency band . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these non - gaussian states tend to be extremely sensitive to losses , and thus , coupling them directly into an optical parametric oscillator will easily erase any signature of their strong nonclassicality such as the negativity of the wigner function . </S>",
    "<S> our demonstration here was made possible by introducing a recent technique for bandwidth broadening as well as a mechanism for increased loss robustness to the squeezing gate @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate for the first time a deterministic squeezing gate that operates on non - gaussian input states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as what we believe to be a nice illustration , we use a particle - like single - photon state as the input state of the squeezing gate . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting output state then is a wave - like css . </S>",
    "<S> since single - mode squeezing corresponds to a unitary , noiseless amplification process along a certain phase - space direction , our single - photon squeezer can be also interpreted as a phase - sensitive amplifier acting on an optical field mode in its first excited state ( for a more detailed discussion of this interpretation , see the supplemental material @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also demonstrate the inverse operation of the squeezer , where a wave - like css is converted into a particle - like single - photon state . from a more fundamental point of view , what we demonstrate here can be considered an unconditional and reversible two - way conversion between a single quantum particle and a non - classical , continuous wave . unlike the previous probabilistic conversion from a photon number state to a css @xcite , the squeezing gate deterministically and reversibly transforms a single photon into a css . </S>",
    "<S> the css , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a coherent state @xcite , is a highly non - classical quantum state sufficient for universal quantum computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that an all - optical , high - purity , almost - on - demand single - photon source was reported recently @xcite , while no such source has ever been demonstrated for a css state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our unconditional conversion between these two types of states means that , in principle , all such quantum resources , including css states , are now available nearly on demand .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this experiment paves the way for quantum applications that combine discrete - particle and continuous - wave protocols in a so - called hybrid fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the squeezing - gate operation when acting on non - gaussian states has also a number of direct applications , such as quantum state discrimination of optical coherent - state qubits @xcite , gaussian optimization in non - gaussian state preparation @xcite , improved quantum state transmission through a lossy channel @xcite , and preprocessing before a light - matter coupling for an efficient quantum memory interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been also realized that squeezing is an extremely useful tool for manipulating and measuring individual photons , for instance , in squeezing - enhanced bell measurements of optical qubits @xcite or in squeezing - enhanced entanglement distillation protocols where optical gaussian states are locally transformed into qubit bell pairs @xcite .    1 ): beam splitter with transmittance @xmath2 determining the degree of squeezing , opo : optical parametric oscillator , sc : separating cavity , fc : filter cavity , apd : avalanche photo diode , hd : homodyne detector , lo : optical local oscillator , eom : electro - optic modulator , cc : classical channel , r : reflectivity </S>",

    "<S> it consists of two parts : a source of non - classical states and an unconditional squeezer . for the former , via a small variation of the setup , we can choose the non - classical states to be either a single photon @xcite or a css @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these are specifically designed to reveal either the most distinct features of the particle - to - wave transition or that of the converse , wave - to - particle transition @xcite ( for details , see the supplemental material @xcite ) .    from an experimental point of view , it has been considered notoriously hard to apply a quantum optical squeezing operation upon more exotic , non - gaussian quantum states such as discrete - variable single - photon states . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we have succeeded in this difficult task . by demonstrating the efficient and deterministic squeezing and unsqueezing of a single photon , </S>",
    "<S> we have opened an entirely new optical toolbox for future quantum information applications . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , such a unitary , phase - sensitive amplifier ( and attenuator ) will allow for making use of the entire fock space when processing single photons , which may help to construct quantum gates and error correction codes for logical qubits . </S>",
    "<S> using our universal and reversible low - loss broadband squeezer , we have for the first time access to a complete set of deterministic gaussian operations applicable to non - classical , non - gaussian states . </S>",
    "<S> these expand the toolbox for hybrid quantum information processing @xcite , and therefore our result will directly lead to applications in this area . at the same time , besides providing a completely new class of optical quantum processors , our experiment bridges two quantum - mechanically distinct regimes : that of particle - like quantum states such as single photons with that of more wave - like states such as coherent - state superpositions .    </S>",
