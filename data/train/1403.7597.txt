    "like the sun and supernova remnants , thunderclouds as well as lightning are powerful particle accelerators in which electrons are accelerated by electric fields to a few tens of mev or higher energies .",
    "then , they in turn produce high - energy gamma rays extending from a few hundred kev to a few tens of mev or 100 mev on rare occasions .",
    "in addition to gamma rays and electrons , some observations  @xcite showed that neutrons were probably produced in association with lightning and thunderclouds .",
    "to explain such neutron generations , two mechanism have been investigated theoretically and experimentally since the first positive neutron detection  @xcite .",
    "one is fusion mechanism via @xmath3 , and the other is photonuclear reaction or the giant resonance reaction ( gdr ) , mainly via @xmath4 in the atmosphere . conducting numerical calculations , @xcite presented that only the latter was feasible in an usual thunderstorm environment .",
    "however , a recent calculation considering ion runaway in a lightning discharge suggested a possibility of neutron production via the former  @xcite .",
    "thus , a neutron generation process in thunderstorms remains elusive .",
    "experimentally , a @xmath5 and @xmath6 counters were frequently employed in order to detect neutrons associated with thunderstorms . as well known ,",
    "the two detectors have high sensitivity to neutrons thanks to high total cross - section in thermal to epithermal energy region ; 3840 b for @xmath7 and 5330 b for @xmath1 at 0.025 ev  @xcite . especially , a set of neutron monitors ( nms ) , installed at high mountains with an altitude of @xmath83000 m , detected remarkable count increases during thunderstorms  @xcite .",
    "generally , a nm consists of a @xmath5 counter and its thick shields of lead and polyethylene [ @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "thus , it was naturally considered that the detected count increases by nms were attributable to neutrons , not gamma rays .",
    "however , @xcite , using geant4 simulations  @xcite , demonstrated that such a nm had a low but innegligible sensitivity to gamma rays with their energy higher than 7 mev because they can produce neutrons in the surrounding lead blocks via photonuclear reaction .",
    "consequently , they pointed out that count enhancements of nms associated with thunderstorms were dominated by gamma rays rather than neutrons .",
    "this claim was favored shortly afterward by @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ex_event ] , @xcite recently reported detections of strong flux of low - energy ( @xmath10 a few kev ) neutrons during thunderstorms .",
    "they observed the enhancements by several independent detectors for 1 minutes or longer , in coincidence with high electric field changes ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "such a long duration , together with the simultaneous detections , may exclude the increases being due to electrical noise , and is similar to prolonged ones observed by other groups  @xcite . unlike the other observations ,",
    "the gurevich s events were done with a set of @xmath2 counters that were installed at a high mountain with an altitude of 3340 m. they argued that the detected neutron flux of 0.03@xmath120.05 @xmath13 were not able to be explained by the photonuclear reaction , requiring at least three orders of magnitude higher flux of gamma rays emission than previously measured .",
    "however , such an increase obtained by @xmath2 counters may originate from gamma rays , not neutrons , if we consider inelastic interaction between high - energy gamma rays and their cathode wall made by aluminum or stainless steel .",
    "for example , a threshold energy of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is 13.1 mev and 8.3 mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "actually , gamma rays at enrages of 10 mev or higher have been measured by sea - level experiments  @xcite , high - mountain ones  @xcite , and space missions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is well known that neutron measurement by a @xmath1 counter is disturbed by gamma rays in a mixed field of gamma rays and neutrons  @xcite .",
    "such a mixture environment is similar to observations of gamma rays and neutrons during thunderstorms .    in this paper , we investigate how materials surrounding @xmath0 counters affect their measurement during thunderstorms . for this aim , we derived in section 2 , with geant4 , detection efficiency of a @xmath0 counter for @xmath810 mev gamma rays as well as neutrons in 0.01 ev@xmath1220 mev energy range .",
    "some authors  @xcite argued against an interpretation given by @xcite , but did not clearly gave detection efficiency of a @xmath0 counter for gamma rays .",
    "then , to examine how neutrons and gamma rays contributes to a @xmath0 counter surrounded by a thick or thin material , we utilized two roof configurations according to @xcite in section 3 .",
    "considering the derived efficiency and roof effects on neutron detection during thunderstorms , we argue the gurevich observations .",
    "as described in @xcite , a reason why a @xmath2 counter has a sensitivity to gamma rays is believed that they occasionally supply either neutrons or protons in the counter via inelastic interaction with a cathode wall . as a consequence , such a gamma - ray",
    "induced nucleon would produce a large energy deposit in the counter .",
    "table  [ tab : pnreaction ] lists properties of several photonuclear reactions to be considered in this paper . from this table , gamma rays at energies of @xmath810 mev are found to probably give a contribution to a @xmath0 counter during thunderstorms , because its cathode usually consists of either al or stainless steel .    for the purpose of calculating detection efficiencies of @xmath0 counters for neutrons and gamma rays in the relevant energy range",
    ", we adopted in the geant4 simulation a hadronic model of qgsp`_`bert`_`hp and geant4 standard electromagnetic physics package to simulate neutron reactions and electromagnetic interactions including gdr , respectively .",
    "then , we constructed a set of three @xmath16 counters confined in an al box with an area of @xmath17 based on `` experimental setup '' of @xcite and a reference given by gurevich group  @xcite .",
    "the setup is shown in figure  [ fig : gurevich_counter ] .",
    "each counter has a diameter of 3 cm and a length of 100 cm , containing 100% @xmath16 gas with a pressure of 2 atm . because the thickness and cathode material were not shown in @xcite",
    ", we employed in our geant4 simulation 2-mm thick stainless steel ( 74%fe + 8%ni + 18%cr ) that is generally used by a commercial @xmath16 counter .",
    "then , @xmath18 neutrons or @xmath19 gamma rays with mono energy were illuminated on the same area of a set of six @xmath2 counters , isotropically injected to the counters from the vertical to 60 degrees .    according to @xcite , an efficiency of thier @xmath16 counters for neutrons in a low energy range",
    "is about 60% , and the efficiency at @xmath2010 kev becomes three orders of magnitude lower .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : he3_det_ng ] , this trend is found to be consistent with that of neutron detection efficiency derived here .",
    "in addition , it is found that the whole structure of the detection efficiency for neutrons in a wide energy range of 0.01 ev@xmath1220 mev completely follows the total cross - section of @xmath0 atom ; mainly a neutron capture reaction of @xmath21 in energy below 0.1 mev and an elastic scattering above 0.1 mev .",
    "these consistencies validate the simulation .    due to the smaller cross - section",
    ", gamma rays are detected with a relatively low sensitivity of at most @xmath22 at 20 mev ( the error is statistical one only ) .",
    "this is consistent with that each peak energy of photonuclear reaction for @xmath23 and @xmath24 is around 20 mev ( table  [ tab : pnreaction ] ) . from this simulation",
    ", it was found that gamma - ray induced protons or neutrons ( alpha on rare occasions ) had a typical kinetic energy of nearly 10 mev .",
    "then , such a proton ( or alpha ) deposits via ionization loss an amount of a hundred kev or higher energies in a @xmath0 counter , while the gamma - ray induced neutron mainly causes an elastic scattering with @xmath0 nucleus to produce a large energy deposit of @xmath81 mev . changing a cathode material of stainless steel to al",
    ", we found that gamma - ray detection efficiency for al was the same with the derived values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : he3_det_ng ] ) , within statistical uncertainty .",
    "in this paper , we utilized secondary energy spectra obtained in the same manner with @xcite . air density of their observational level ( 4300 m above sea level ) is @xmath20@xmath25 @xmath26 , which is almost the same with that of @xmath20@xmath27 @xmath26 ( 3340 m ) of @xcite .",
    "based on results of actual measurement  @xcite , these spectra were made with geant4 assuming that primary gamma rays have power - law type energy spectrum with its index , @xmath28 of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or @xmath31 and the energy range of 10@xmath12100 mev .",
    "gamma rays arriving at the observational level have energy spectra that are almost the same with those of fig.7 in @xcite .",
    "spectra of neutrons will be shown later .      from the viewpoint",
    "that neutron production is a well - known photonuclear reaction , we consider two possible reasons of the enhancements presented by @xcite .",
    "one is that low - energy neutron flux produced via photonuclear reaction is very high , especially in thermal to epithremal energies ( 0.01@xmath1210 ev ) , in which a @xmath0 counter readily detect neutrons . the other is a gamma - ray contribution in detected counts . here , we firstly investigated the former case by deriving survival probability of @xmath80.01 ev neutrons at the observational level .",
    "figure  [ fig : topofroof_nspe ] shows geant4-derived neutron energy spectra at the observational level , suggesting that path length of @xmath100.3 km from a source to an observatory is not long enough to thremalize neutrons produced via photonuclear reaction , because of the considerably long interaction length , @xmath201.7 @xmath32 @xmath33 of the photonuclear reaction in the air .",
    "then , integrating each neutron energy spectrum at the observational level over 0.01 ev@xmath12100 mev assuming primary gamma rays are emitted from @xmath34 0.01@xmath123 km , we obtained in figure  [ fig : comp_surb ] survival probability of @xmath80.01 ev neutrons produced via photonuclear reaction . for comparison , survival probability of @xmath81 kev neutrons",
    "are also plotted .",
    "as easily seen , the survival probability of @xmath80.01 ev neutrons ( open symbols ) above 0.3 km is only at most 8% higher than that for @xmath81 kev ( filled symbols ) .",
    "as expected , the @xmath80.01-ev probability at @xmath350.3 km is almost the same with that for @xmath81 kev neutrons .",
    "thus , we can reject a hypothesis that extremely high flux of low - energy neutrons arrived at the observational level to provide the count enhancements of @xcite .",
    "we next compare flux of @xmath80.01 ev neutrons reaching the observational level with that of @xmath810 mev gamma rays .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : rationg_h ] , the derived ratios monotonously increase from @xmath20@xmath36 at @xmath37 km toward @xmath205@xmath38 at @xmath34 1.5 km , and take roughly constant in @xmath34 of 1.5@xmath123 km , within large statistical uncertainty .    assuming the detected signals by @xmath0 counters all were attributable to neutrons",
    ", @xcite emphasized that 10@xmath1230 mev gamma - ray flux of 10@xmath1230 @xmath13 was required to explain their detections of low - energy neutrons with flux of 0.03@xmath120.05 @xmath13 . from their flux , we can obtain a ratio of neutron flux to gamma - ray one as @xmath391@xmath125@xmath40@xmath38 , which is consistent with that derived above .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the relation between flux of gamma rays and neutrons follows the standpoint of photonuclear reaction , though we do not still know how such high gamma - ray flux is generated in thunderclouds .        for the purpose of calculating contribution ratios of neutrons and gamma rays in @xmath0-counter signals during thunderstorms , hereafter we employed energy spectra of secondary neutrons and gamma rays assuming @xmath41 .    in the measurements done by @xcite ,",
    "one group of @xmath1 counters was installed inside a building with its roof consisting of iron and carbon ( this group is called `` internal counters '' in @xcite ) .",
    "the thickness of iron and carbon is 0.2 cm and 20 cm , respectively .",
    "the other was arranged at a building with its roof comprised of a light plywood ( @xmath42 ) ( this is called `` external counters '' in @xcite ) .",
    "because the thickness of the plywood was not written in the literature , we assumed it was 2 cm . here",
    ", the area of each roof was assumed to be 10 m@xmath4310 m ( an area of the roofs do not affect the final result ) . also , we adopted density of iron , carbon , and plywood as 7.87 , 2.26 , and 0.55 @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "then , gamma rays ( neutrons ) with a geant4-calculated energy spectrum were vertically irradiated from just above the individual roofs within an area of the roofs to investigate how it affects an energy spectrum of penetrating particles including gamma rays and neutrons .",
    "total number of gamma rays ( neutrons ) incident to each roof was 1@xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gnspe_under_roof ] shows energy spectra of neutrons and gamma rays that are observed under the individual roofs .",
    "table  [ tab : prob_pene_fc ] and [ tab : prob_pene_pl ] list probability that gamma rays or neutrons incident to the two roofs penetrate through them . compared with the roof - top neutron spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : topofroof_nspe ] ) , those under the roofs drastically decrease over 0.01@xmath1210 ev , in which neutrons can be easily detected by a @xmath0 counter .",
    "the reduction is mainly because of neutron reflection by materials in the roofs .",
    "importantly , @xmath810 mev gamma - ray flux for the fe@xmath46c roof is different from that for the plywood roof , only by a factor of @xmath202 .    from table [ tab :",
    "prob_pene_fc ] and [ tab : prob_pene_pl ] , we can know what kind of generation processes contribute to the spectra under the roofs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gnspe_under_roof ] ) . as expected ,",
    "probability of gamma rays incident to each roof , @xmath47 is the highest among the others ( table  [ tab : prob_pene_fc ] and [ tab : prob_pene_pl ] ) .",
    "this probability , which corresponds to @xmath810 mev power - law part ( filled symbols of fig .  [ fig : gnspe_under_roof ] ) , indicates that part of the incident gamma rays transmit the roofs without absorption or pair creation .",
    "@xmath48 for fe@xmath46c roof is more than five orders of magnitude higher than the other probabilities , and that for plywood is more than two orders of magnitude higher than them .",
    "these results suggest that high - energy gamma rays are the most dominant component to enter @xmath0 counters and can realize high gamma - ray field as previously mentioned .",
    "thus , a careful discrimination of thunderstorm - related neutrons from gamma rays would be required to detect neutrons during thunderstorms , as previously pointed out by @xcite as well .",
    "in addition to @xmath48 , another gamma - ray component of @xmath49 is almost related to neutron capture reaction of @xmath50 .",
    "the reaction produces 10.8 mev prompt gamma rays , while other capture reactions with nuclei in the roofs do not produce @xmath810 mev prompt gamma rays , at most @xmath208 mev  @xcite . in practice",
    ", it was found that neutrons captured by @xmath51 were caused by elastic scatterings from the roofs .",
    "one neutron component @xmath52 is associated with photoinelastic reactions that produce not only neutrons but simultaneously gamma rays at energies from a few hundred kev to a few mev .",
    "in addition , @xmath53 results from incident neutrons that suffer single or multiple elastic scatterings in the roofs .",
    "thus , @xmath53 for the thin plywood roof ( 2 cm ) is higher than that for the thick fe@xmath46 c roof ( 20.2 cm ) .      convoluting the energy spectra under the individual roofs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gnspe_under_roof ] ) with detection efficiency of a @xmath0 counter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : he3_det_ng ] ) , we can estimate how neutrons and gamma rays contribute to count increases measured by a @xmath0 counter .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : detcompgn.eps ] , we found a clear difference in contribution fraction of @xmath0-counter signals between the two roofs .",
    "gamma rays dominate , by @xmath2080% or higher fraction , signal detected by a @xmath1 coutner installed under the fe@xmath46c roof ( filled squares ) and they contribute a tiny fraction , @xmath104% of signal for the thin plywood roof ( open squares ) @xmath34 above 0.3 km . however , the gamma - ray fraction for the plywood roof is found rapidly increase below 0.3 km and be more than 10 times higher at @xmath37 km than that for neutrons .",
    "these results imply two important points .",
    "one is that a @xmath0 counter covered by a thick material would have a better sensitivity to thundercloud - related gamma rays rather than those neutrons .",
    "this is mainly because neutrons , if produced via photonuclear reaction , are reflected to the atmosphere by a thick materials .",
    "the other is that a @xmath0 counter , when surrounded by thin materials , largely detects thundercloud - related gamma rays if a gamma - ray source is very close to it .",
    "considering both the neutron and gamma - ray contributions , we can calculate a ratio of detected counts under the plywood roof , @xmath54 , to those for the fe@xmath46c roof , @xmath55 and compare them with the measurement done by @xcite .",
    "obviously , either @xmath55 or @xmath54 is shown by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent counts expected from neutrons and gamma rays , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath59 and @xmath58 is expressed by @xmath60 respectively .",
    "here , @xmath61 and @xmath62 shows a normalization constant of primary gamma - ray spectrum at source and geometrical area of @xmath0 counters , respectively . @xmath63 and @xmath64 are an energy spectrum under each roof ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gnspe_under_roof ] ) and detection efficiency of a @xmath0 counter for neutrons and gamma rays ( fig.[fig : he3_det_ng ] ) , respectively . finally , we computed ratios of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 to eliminate unknown @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio_gntot ] compares calculated ratios with the measurement presented by @xcite .",
    "apparently , @xmath65 ( circles ) can not reproduce the measured ratios ranging from 1.3 to 5.3 ( arrow ) , in a wide range of @xmath34 ( 0.01@xmath123 km ) .",
    "@xcite also remarked that they were unable to explain the gurevich results when considering a neutron contribution originating from photonuclear reaction .",
    "very interestingly , @xmath66 , which is almost constant in a wide range of @xmath34 , is quite consistent with the gurevich results .",
    "consequently , @xmath67 matches the gurevich results when @xmath34 is less than 0.05 km . from this",
    "as well as the gamma - ray contribution at @xmath35 0.05 km ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detcompgn.eps ] ) , we guess that the observatory ( 3340 m above sea level ) of @xcite was very close to or inside a gamma - ray source region in thunderclouds and hence their @xmath0 counters almost detected thundercloud - related gamma rays .",
    "in such a nearby case , a traveling path for gamma rays to reach their counters would be too short to produce sufficient neutron flux via photonuclear reaction in comparison with gamma - ray flux ( squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : rationg_h ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite , observing thundercloud - related gamma rays at an observatory located at 2770 m above sea level , demonstrated that a source height of the gamma - ray emitting region was 0.06@xmath120.13 km at 95% confidence level .",
    "therefore , an extremely nearby situation would be expected in case of a mountain observatory .",
    "the present simulation clearly showed that a @xmath0 counter had a small sensitivity to @xmath810 mev gamma rays .",
    "it was found that this ability enabled @xmath0 counters to detect thundercloud - related gamma rays rather than those neutrons if surrounded by thick materials .",
    "thus , it would be rather difficult to conclude that a @xmath0-counter signal detected during thunderstorms is all attributable to neutrons like previously thought  @xcite . to obtain a conclusive answer whether detected counts are dominated by neutrons or gamma rays",
    ", we must consider a source height as well as surrounding material impacts on measurement by @xmath0 counters . given the present results",
    ", we may conclude that the large count enhancements obtained by @xcite is resulted from @xmath810 mev gamma rays radiated from a very nearby source in thunderclouds .    to clarify the present finding",
    ", we will need to install @xmath0 counters at other high mountains and conduct further experiments with @xmath0 counters and gamma - ray detectors .",
    "in addition , like a recent measurement done by @xcite , a laboratory experiment using a high - voltage generator and various detectors to catch neutrons and gamma rays would be promising . in this paper , we did not consider another neutron generation process such as the fission mechanism of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we are unable to rule out a possibility that such a mechanism contributes to the large count enhancements .",
