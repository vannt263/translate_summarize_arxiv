    ", it was found that , in the particular case of an early - type sample of active and non - active galaxies , all the active galaxies had dusty structures in the inner few hundred parsecs , while only 25% of the non - actives had such structures , implying that the dust was a tracer of the gas feeding the active nucleus .",

    "this connection between the presence of dusty spirals and nuclear activity in galaxies suggests that the gas might be streaming along these structures toward the central region to feed the smbh inside @xcite .",
    "the dust mass at kpc scales in agns is estimated to be in the range @xmath9m@xmath10 @xcite and the associated large amounts of molecular gas ( @xmath11 to @xmath12m@xmath10 ) reinforces the importance of searching for signatures of molecular - gas inflows within the inner kiloparsec .",
    "on the other hand , recent studies have also found massive outflows of molecular gas @xcite , in particular , in luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "observations of nearby active galaxies using spatially resolved ifs provide constraints for the feeding and feedack processes .",
    "the study of these processes in nearby agns have been carried out using ifs at near - ir bands , which contain emission lines from molecular ( tracer the agn feeding ) and ionized ( tracer of the agn feedback ) gas .",

    "it is shown that these lines seem to be better tracers of agn outflows than the previously used [ o iii]@xmath165007@xmath17 emission line .",

    "they also observed excess blueshifts and redshifts in the cold gas disk kinematics relative to rotational motion that were attributed to inflows and outflows.they have shown that the apparent asymmetry of the gas velocity field is due to the superposition of the contribution of the different components ; when this is taken into account , there is no more asymmetry in the velocity fields .",

    "the near infrared observations of ngc2110 were obtained with the integral field spectrograph nifs @xcite on the gemini north telescope in two distinct nights , under the programme gn-2010b - q-25 . in the first night , five exposures of 600 seconds were obtained for the galaxy , 3 observations with the same exposure time for the sky and 3 exposures of 18 seconds each for the telluric star . in the second night , only one exposure of 600 seconds for the galaxy and for the sky and 4 observations of 15 seconds for the telluric standard star were obtained .",
    "the data reduction was performed using specific tasks contained in the nifs package which is part of gemini iraf package .",
    "the reduction process followed standard procedures such as trimming of images , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength and spatial distortion calibrations .",
    "the telluric absorptions were removed using the spectrum of the telluric standard star and the flux calibration was performed by interpolation a black body function to the spectrum of the telluric standard star .",

    "we applied the same procedure to the continuum image of the standard star and noticed that the effect of this procedure in the measured fwhm is smaller than 5% and thus the rebinning of the maps does not degrade the spatial resolution of the data significantly .",

    "the same hypothesis was put forth by @xcite , where the authors observed a compact outflow from the nucleus of ngc2110 , suggesting a spherical geometry , using optical integral field spectroscopy . in the case of 2 ,",
    "most of the gas is concentrated at the disk of the galaxy , and thus the interaction of the expanding spherical bubble is seen only at locations where the 2 is present , forming the bipolar structure seen in the residual map .    on the basis of our and other s previous studies of the morphology of the outflow ( as its extent is of the order of the psf fwhm ) , we assume a bi - conical structure with an opening angle of 60@xmath112 with a radius @xmath236pc ( consistent with the constraints posed by the flux distribution of the outflowing gas ) and use the following expression :    @xmath237    where @xmath238 is the outflowing gas velocity , @xmath239 accounts for the two sides of the bi - cone and @xmath240 is the angle that the central axis of the cone makes with the plane of the sky . the velocity can be obtained directly from figure  [ flows ] and is @xmath241 . using the estimated @xmath242 by @xcite",

    "the position angle of this bar , as well as its extent ( @xmath1390pc ) is consistent with what we have interpreted as an outflow seen in our 2 velocity map , that shows blueshifts to one side of the nucleus but redshifts to the other side .",
    "if this structure is a bar , one possibility is that the inflows are feeding the bar , whose orientation ( p.a.@xmath24 125@xmath112 ) is close to the galaxy major axis ( p.a.@xmath244 ) .",
    "unfortunately we do not have observations in the j or h band to compare the emitting gas kinematics with that of the 2 emitting gas .",
    "further observations and modeling would be necessary in order to settle on the nature of this feature .      the inflow and outflow rates estimated above can be compared to the accretion rate onto the smbh that is needed to power the agn .",
    "the mass accretion rate to the agn can be estimated via : @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the speed of light , @xmath247 is the efficiency of conversion of matter into energy ( for seyfert galaxies @xmath248 ) , and @xmath249 is the agn bolometric luminosity .",

    "if we use instead the bolometric luminosity from @xcite , of @xmath253ergs@xmath6 , we obtain a somewhat larger value of @xmath254m@xmath10yr@xmath6 than that obtained above .",
    "the accretion rate is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the inflow and outflow rates in warm molecular gas , indicating that it is necessary more mass flowing towards the center to feed the smbh , but , as pointed above , the inflowing mass is probably dominated by cold molecular gas .",
    "the mass inflow rate in warm 2 obtained for ngc2110 is similar to those obtained for other seyfert galaxies @xcite with similar luminosities to that of ngc2110 .",
    "the outflow rate in warm molecular gas is about three orders of magnitude smaller than mass outflow rates we have observed in ionized gas for other seyfert galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and up to 6 orders of magnitude smaller than those observed for high luminosity seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but the compact outflow we have observed in warm 2 for ngc2110 may represent only a small fraction of the total outflow from the nucleus of this galaxy , that is probably also dominated by cold molecular gas .",
    "a possible scenario for the inner region of ngc2110 is that the inflows observed in 2 feed the central region of the galaxy and the accreted gas then triggers both star formation and the nuclear activity . indeed ,",

    "our main conclusions are :    * the stellar kinematics shows velocity dispersion reaching @xmath13250km@xmath134 around the nucleus as well as a rotation pattern with a similar velocity amplitude ; * from the relation @xmath153 , we estimate the mass of the smbh as @xmath256m@xmath10 . *",
