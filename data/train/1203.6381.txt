    "the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg hamiltonian with additional af next - nearest neighbor coupling is one of the most studied models , known as the @xmath0 , in theoretical physics : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is a spin-1/2 operator associated to the @xmath7th lattice site and the first ( second ) summation runs over nearest ( next - nearest ) neighbor sites.@xcite    model ( [ ham ] ) is of relevance for experimentally accessible compounds,@xcite and constitutes a canonical example of spin system featuring frustration induced by competing af interactions .",
    "it is known that , on the square lattice , the ground state ( gs ) of ( [ ham ] ) displays af long - range order of nel [ ordering wave vector @xmath8 type at @xmath9 ( i.e. , in the unfrustrated case);@xcite the nel order remains for sufficiently small values of @xmath10 while at large @xmath10 the af order is collinear [ @xmath11 or @xmath12.@xcite to gain insight into the nature of the gs at intermediate values of @xmath10 , several numerical techniques have been applied .",
    "the exact diagonalization ( ed ) of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is possible only for small lattice size ( up to @xmath13 spins ) , therefore , although this approach may give fundamental suggestions , a reliable extrapolation of the relevant physical observables to the thermodynamic limit is basically not achievable .",
    "on the other hand , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) schemes based on the imaginary time evolution of a trial wave function ( wf ) are essentially exact , even for very large lattices , at @xmath9 , being affected by the sign problem at finite @xmath10 ( i.e. , in presence of frustration ) .",
    "variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations overcome the major limitations of ed and qmc being not restricted to small lattice size and , by definition , free of any sign instability .",
    "however , their accuracy depends on the guess for the gs wf . hence , understanding and characterizing the gs properties of the @xmath0 model in the maximally frustrated regime ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath14 for a square geometry ) is as difficult as it is interesting .",
    "ed findings are consistent with a paramagnetic valence bond crystalline ( vbc ) phase intervening between the nel and collinear one.@xcite this conclusion also arises ( albeit with possibly different vbc patterns ) from recent projected - entangled pair states,@xcite series expansion and spin - wave theory,@xcite coupled - cluster,@xcite hierarchical mean field,@xcite and renormalized tensor network@xcite investigations , whose main objective has been that of elucidating the type of phase transition occurring at the boundary between the nel and paramagnetic vbc state .",
    "recent vmc calculations pointed out the existence of a spin liquid ( i.e. , paramagnetic with no vbc order ) gs for model ( [ ham ] ) on a honeycomb lattice,@xcite revitalizing the long - lasting debate concerning the possibility of observing a similar phase on the square lattice.@xcite    in this paper we investigate the gs phase diagram of ( [ ham ] ) using a vmc approach based on the variational family of entangled - plaquette states ( eps).@xcite the eps wf is a general ansatz which has been applied to a variety of unfrustrated ( bosonic ) or frustrated ( fermionic ) lattice problems yielding results of accuracy at least comparable to ( or better than ) that obtainable with different numerical schemes or alternative variational wfs.@xcite in particular it has been employed with success to determine the gs phase diagram of ( [ ham ] ) on the honeycomb lattice,@xcite giving predictions quantitatively and qualitatively more accurate than those affordable using different ansatzs.@xcite the main quality of the eps wf is its systematic improvability which allows one to compute increasingly accurate estimates of physical observables by sequentially increasing the plaquette size ( i.e. , the number of spins comprised in a single plaquette ) @xmath15 .",
    "we estimate gs energies and relevant order parameters , i.e. , square sublattice magnetization ( ssm ) and various vbc structure factors , in the range @xmath16 . for each system size , up to @xmath17 spins with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , the eps wf is independently optimized , starting with @xmath18 square plaquettes of four sites .",
    "the size of our plaquettes is then consistently and systematically increased up to sixteen spins by adding @xmath19 sites each time that @xmath15 is changed .",
    "we extrapolate the estimates obtained on finite lattices of different sizes , for a given plaquette size , to the thermodinamic limit and , finally , asses the dependence of our results on @xmath15 .",
    "our main findings are the following : _ a _ ) the system is nel ordered up to @xmath20 , while for @xmath21 the magnetic order is collinear ; _ b _ ) for intermediate values of @xmath10 all the order parameters considered here vanish in the thermodynamic limit signaling the emergence of a spin liquid ; _ c _ ) by estimating the entanglement entropy@xcite we characterize such a spin liquid as topological .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the basic aspects of the eps wf , referring the reader to refs . , and for further details .    a generic wf for a spin-1/2 lattice system , e.g. , the one described in model ( [ ham ] ) ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the eigenvalue of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the weight of a configuration of the system .",
    "the eps ansatz is based on the following idea : cover the lattice with @xmath18 plaquettes of @xmath15 sites , and identify the weight of a given global configuration with the product of @xmath18 variational coefficients in one - to - one correspondence with the particular plaquette configuration .",
    "hence , @xmath27 where the configuration of the @xmath28 plaquette is given by the values @xmath29 at its @xmath15 sites .",
    "the above choice of @xmath30 fully specifies the eps wf .",
    "such an ansatz , when overlapping ( i.e. , entangled ) plaquettes are considered ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) naturally incorporates spin - spin correlations , a crucial ingredient to describe the physics of a quantum gs .",
    "as already mentioned , the fundamental property of this variational choice is its systematic improvability obtainable by increasing @xmath15 . given its simple form , the eps wf is efficiently optimizable on a computer ; moreover , once optimized , it allows for an evaluation of the physical observables efficient as well .",
    "both the wf optimization and the estimates of physical observables are achieved via the monte carlo method.@xcite",
    "model on the square lattice with pbc , as a function of the system size .",
    "estimates are obtained with @xmath18 plaquettes of @xmath32 ( boxes ) , @xmath33 ( triangles ) and @xmath34 ( circles ) sites .",
    "each dashed line is a fit to numerical data with the same @xmath15 value .",
    "right : gs energy per site , extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit , as a function of the plaquette size .",
    "each dashed line is a fitting function linear in @xmath35 ( see text ) .",
    "the qmc estimate in the @xmath9 case is also shown for comparison ( star).@xcite , title=\"fig : \" ]    figure [ fig:1 ] shows the gs energy per site @xmath36 as a function of the system size for various values of @xmath10 and different plaquette size ( left part ) . regardless the system size and the value of @xmath10 our estimates sensibly improve when @xmath15 increases .",
    "for example we obtain @xmath37 and @xmath38 using @xmath39 and @xmath40 square plaquettes respectively .",
    "estimates obtained with the same @xmath15 have been extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit assuming the scaling form @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that extrapolated energies depend on @xmath15 . while in principle larger plaquette sizes have to be employed in order to observe numerical convergence of the results , available computational resources limit the largest plaquette size which can be used in practice .",
    "however , by construction of the eps ansatz , the estimate of any observable must approach the exact gs value in the limit of large @xmath15 . therefore",
    ", the point here is whether it is possible to give a reliable estimate of such a limit based on the results obtained with plaquettes of relatively small size .",
    "as pointed out in a previous work@xcite on model ( [ ham ] ) on a honeycomb lattice , this is indeed the case and estimates of the energy and all the relevant physical observables can be obtained , in the large @xmath15 limit , by those computed with plaquette of different size ( up to @xmath34 in this study ) . in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we present an example of this procedure : we expand our energy per site extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit in powers of @xmath42 and fit our data with the smallest number of parameters . we observe that a good description of our results is obtained employing a single power ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "for instance , in absence of frustration , our energies @xmath43 fall almost perfectly on a straight line when plotted against @xmath35 , and we find an extrapolated to the large @xmath15 limit energy in agreement with the qmc estimate,@xcite exact in this case.@xcite     model on the square lattice with pbc , as a function of the system size .",
