    "pulsars create magnetospheres around themselves ( goldreich and julian 1969 , ruderman and sutherland 1975 ) . full quantitative description of a magnetosphere requires a kinetics input  we need to know how the charges and photons are produced .",
    "it turns out that the main overall characteristics of the pulsar are calculable without any detailed knowledge of the kinetics .",
    "here we calculate the pulsar spin - down power @xmath3 and the pulsar efficiency @xmath4 , defined as the ratio of the pulsed bolometric luminosity to @xmath3 .",
    "our results , valid to some 10% accuracy , are as follows .",
    "the efficiency is , where @xmath5 is the spin - dipole angle .",
    "the spin - down luminosity is l_sd(0.8 + 1.2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath6 is the magnetic dipole moment and @xmath7 is the angular velocity .",
    "\\(i ) the fermi pulsar catalog ( abdo et al 2010 ) lists 46 pulsars . only 10 are known to have @xmath8 . these might be out of the beam .",
    "\\(ii ) our theory (  3 ) in the present form should not be used for light curves and spectra ",
    "kinetics seem to matter . but a crude estimate of the characteristic photon energy is possible ( curvature emission in an electric field @xmath9 magnetic field at the light cylinder , radius of curvature @xmath9 light cylinder radius ) : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the spin - down power in units of @xmath12erg / s and @xmath13 is the pulsar period in ms .",
    "this formula is ok ( to factor 3 ) for all the catalog pulsars but 14 .",
    "for these 14 pulsars , the formula gives a frequency some 3 - 10 times higher than observed .",
    "all these 14 pulsars either have or may have small efficiency , and may be out of the beam .",
    "we calculate the pulsar using the so - called electrodynamics of massless charges ( emc , gruzinov 2012 ) .",
    "emc describes the motion of light charges in strong electromagnetic fields .",
    "due to strong radiation damping , the dynamics becomes `` aristotelian '' , with the charge velocity rather than acceleration given by the field values .",
    "positive and negative charges move at the speed light in the directions [ emc ] * v*_=*e*(b_0*b*+e_0*e*)b^2+e_0 ^ 2 . here",
    "the scalar @xmath14 and the pseudoscalar @xmath15 are the proper electric and magnetic fields defined by b_0 ^ 2-e_0 ^ 2=b^2-e^2 ,   b_0e_0=*b * ,   e_00 .    to calculate the electromagnetic field , we numerically solve maxwell equations . to solve maxwell equations we need to know the current",
    "let @xmath16 be the absolute values of the charge densities of positive and negative charges .",
    "then the emc equation ( [ emc ] ) gives = + p ( b_0*b*+e_0*e*)b^2+e_0 ^ 2 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath19 , we almost have an ohm s law ( an expression for @xmath20 in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) : [ ohm ] * j*= ( ) * e*+p ( b_0*b*+e_0*e*)b^2+e_0 ^ 2 .",
    "equation ( [ ohm ] ) is not quite an ohm s law , because @xmath23 is unknown ( we only know that @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have checked that when the neutral plasma density @xmath25 becomes large enough , in practice for @xmath26 , the simulation results become insensitive to the actual value of @xmath23 .",
    "this happens in the following way . in most of the volume ,",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 fields are force - free , @xmath27 .",
    "there is also a small volume where the fields are not force - free . in this volume",
    "some of the poynting flux emitted by the star gets dissipated . for larger @xmath23 , the non - force - free volume shrinks , but",
    "the total dissipated power remains fixed .",
    "the damping region is shown in fig",
    "\\(i ) we use uniform cubic grid in a cube .",
    "@xmath21 components are at the corresponding ( parallel ) edges of the grid , @xmath22 components are at the corresponding ( orthogonal ) faces of the grid .",
    "we use outgoing boundary conditions at the faces of the cube .",
    "we solve the evolutionary problem [ max ] _ t * b*=- ,  _ t * e*= -*j*. ( ii ) we have a rotating star at the center of the cube .",
    "this means that inside some sphere the current @xmath20 is given by the ohm s law in a rotating frame plus an external rotating current density .",
    "the external current density is axisymmetric , with the symmetry axis of the current inclined with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "we get the dipole radiation .",
    "\\(iii ) then we add the ohm s law ( [ ohm ] ) outside the star . at this stage",
    "we have to regularize equations ( [ max ] ) by adding small diffusivities ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 with small @xmath30 ) .",
    "the poynting flux emanating from the star is the spin - down power @xmath3 .",
    "the poynting flux leaving the simulation cube is @xmath31 ."
