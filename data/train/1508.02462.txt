    "a _ nonclassical linear boltzmann equation _ has been recently proposed to address particle transport problems in which the particle flux experiences a nonexponential attenuation law @xcite .",
    "this nonexponential behavior arises in certain inhomogeneous random media in which the locations of the scattering centers are spatially correlated , such as in a pebble bed reactor core @xcite .",
    "independent of these developments , a similar kinetic equation has been rigorously derived for the periodic lorentz gas in a series of papers by golse ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and by marklof and str \" ombergsson @xcite .",
    "related work has also been performed by grosjean @xcite , considering a generalization of neutron transport that includes arbitrary path - length distributions .    for the case of monoenergetic particle transport with isotropic scattering ,",
    "the nonclassical linear boltzmann equation is written as @xmath1 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the nonclassical angular flux , @xmath3 is the scattering ratio ( probability of scattering ) , and @xmath4 is a source . here , the total cross section @xmath5 is a function of the path length @xmath6 ( distance traveled by the particle since its previous interaction ) , such that the path length distribution @xmath7 does not have to be exponential . if @xmath0 is exponential , eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) reduces to the classical linear boltzmann equation @xmath8 for the classical angular flux @xmath9 it has been shown @xcite that , by selecting @xmath10 in a proper way , eq .   can be converted to an integral equation for the scalar flux @xmath11 that is identical to the integral equation that can be constructed for certain diffusion - based approximations to eq .   in the hierarchy of the @xmath12 equations @xcite .",
    "the work in this paper shows that this is also the case for the _ nonclassical diffusion equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath13 which is an asymptotic approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) when @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 specifically , we find @xmath0 and the corresponding @xmath10 such that the integral equation for eq .",
    "( [ eq1.6 ] ) is identical to the integral equation for eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "we also show that the second moment of @xmath0 for nonclassical diffusion preserves the _ true _",
    "mean - squared free path @xmath16 , which gives a new insight on the results obtained in @xcite for the classical diffusion approximations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we convert eq .   to an integral equation for the scalar flux given in eq .  .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we convert eq .   to an integral equation for the scalar flux , and find the correct choice of @xmath0 such that the integral equation obtained in section [ sec2 ] is identical to this nonclassical diffusion integral equation .",
    "we also present a numerical example illustrating the differences on @xmath0 and @xmath10 for classical transport , classical diffusion , and nonclassical diffusion .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "let @xmath17 be given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20    we can now write eq .   as the initial value problem    [ eq2.2 ] @xmath21    following the steps presented in @xcite and @xcite , we : ( i ) use the method of characteristics to calculate the solution of eqs .",
    "; ( ii ) operate on this solution by @xmath22 ; and ( iii ) perform the change of spatial variables from the 3-d spherical @xmath23 to the 3-d cartesian @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 .",
    "this yields @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath17 are given by eqs .   and , respectively .",
    "the nonclassical diffusion formulation presented in eq .   is an asymptotic approximation of eq .   in the case of @xmath28 . in this formulation ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath16 as given by eq .",
    "represent the first and second moments of the _ true _ path length distribution @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is exponential , then @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and eq .",
    "reduces to the classical diffusion equation @xmath32    for the general case in which @xmath0 is _ not _ assumed to be an exponential , we define @xmath33 and rewrite eq .   as :    [ eq3.2 ] @xmath34 where @xmath35    the green s function for the operator on the left hand side of eq .",
    "is : @xmath36 therefore , we can transform eq .   into an integral equation for @xmath37 by taking @xmath38 bearing in mind that @xmath39 represents the mean free path of a particle ( i.e. the average distance between collisions ) , the collision - rate density can be written as @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 this result agrees with eq .",
    "iff @xmath42 it is easy to verify that @xmath43 which shows that eq .   is a distribution function .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 is given by @xmath44 this shows that the nonclassical transport equation reproduces the nonclassical diffusion approximation given by eq .   if @xmath0 and @xmath10 are defined by eqs .   and .",
    "moreover , if @xmath0 is exponential , this results agrees with the @xmath0 and @xmath10 obtained for the classical diffusion equation in @xcite .",
    "we also point out that    [ eq3.9 ] @xmath45    the first moment of @xmath0 only approximates the mean free path @xmath29 , as can be seen in eq .  .",
    "however , eq .   shows that the _ true _ mean - squared free path @xmath16 is preserved .",
    "this sheds new light on the results presented in @xcite , where the second moments of the path length distributions obtained for all ( classical ) diffusion approximations give the exact ( classical ) transport value @xmath46 .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the functions @xmath10 and @xmath0 for the transport of neutrons taking place in the interior of a homogenized 3-d pebble bed reactor core system , as described in @xcite .",
    "the system consists of fuel spheres ( pebbles ) randomly packed in a background void with packing fraction @xmath47 .",
    "the parameters for the material of the fuel pebbles are : diameter @xmath48 ; total cross section @xmath49 ; and scattering ratio @xmath50 . as discussed in detail in @xcite , the _ classically homogenized _ system ( using the atomic mix model ) has total cross section @xmath51 , and its _ true _ mean - squared free path is numerically calculated to be @xmath52 .",
    "we note that nonclassical transport occurs due to the spatial correlations of the fuel pebbles in the system , and therefore @xmath53 .",
    "we have shown that the nonclassical diffusion equation for an infinite homogeneous medium can be represented exactly by the nonclassical linear boltzmann equation with the correct choice of @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "we derived explicit expressions for these quantities and showed that , while the first moment of the path length distribution @xmath0 only approximates the true mean free path @xmath39 , its second moment _ preserves _ the true mean - squared free path @xmath16 .",
    "this result provides a deeper understanding of the results presented in @xcite for the second moment of the path - length distributions for classical diffusion approximations .",
    "the work on this paper allows us to construct @xmath0 and @xmath10 that yield the correct solution for the nonclassical boltzmann equation in a diffusive system .",
    "the only parameter necessary for this is the true mean - squared free path @xmath16 .",
    "this paves the road to the possibility of using this easy - to - obtain @xmath0 to approximate the solutions of the nonclassical boltzmann equation as the system moves away from the diffusive limit .",
    "further work needs to be done to investigate how well such approach would perform ; this task , however , must be left for future work .",
