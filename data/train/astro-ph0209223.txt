    "it is strongly suggested by observational data that our universe has the critical energy density and consists of 1/3 of dark matter and 2/3 of dark energy ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , where `` dark '' indicates the invisibility .",
    "even though it is generally not an elegant way to explain data via something we can not see , the avalanche of data , including those from type ia supernova measurements @xcite , cosmic microwave anisotropies @xcite , galactic rotation curves , and surveys of galaxies and clusters ( providing the power spectrum of energy density fluctuations ) , make it more and more convincing . nevertheless , we accordingly need to ask a question : _ why are dark matter and dark energy so dark ? _    this question reminds us another `` dark '' stuff , extra dimensions .",
    "the existence of extra dimensions is required in various theories beyond the standard model of particle physics , especially in the theories for unifying gravity and other forces , such as superstring theory .",
    "extra dimensions should be `` hidden '' ( or `` dark '' ) for consistency with observations .",
    "this common feature , `` invisible existence '' , of dark energy , dark matter , and extra dimensions provides us a hint that there may be some deep relationship among them .    in this paper",
    "we show how extra dimensions may manifest themselves as a source of energy in the ordinary three - space and lead to the dark side of the universe .",
    "basically homogeneous extra dimensions will contribute to dark energy and may also provide some sort of dark matter effectively if combined with the effects of inhomogeneities in the ordinary three - space , and inhomogeneities in the extra space will contribute to dark matter effectively .",
    "the basic idea is sketched in the next section , and then we discuss in sec .",
    "[ homog ed to dark energy ] how homogeneous extra dimensions provide `` effective '' dark energy and influence the evolution of the ordinary three - space , especially , producing the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the extra dimensions employed throughout this paper are small and compact , as introduced in the kaluza - klein theories .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional space - time where @xmath1 is the number of extra spatial dimensions .",
    "the unperturbed metric tensor @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , which describes a universe with homogeneous , isotropic ordinary three - space and extra space , is defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are scale factors , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 relate to curvatures of the ordinary 3-space and the extra space , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is set to be within the interval @xmath10 for the compactness of extra dimensions .",
    "the perturbed metric describing a lumpy universe is defined by @xmath11 dx^{\\mu } dx^{\\nu } + \\left [ 1 + \\delta_{b } ( x^{\\mu } ) \\right]^2 g_{pq } dx^p dx^q , \\label{perturbed metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unperturbed metric tensors , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 corresponding to perturbations , of the ordinary @xmath16-dimensional space - time and the extra space , respectively . as a convention , @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 denote the coordinates of the ordinary space - time and the extra space , respectively , while @xmath19 denotes all the coordinates . for the sake of simplicity the cross terms @xmath20 are abandoned by requiring the symmetry with respect to extra space inversion , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "we note that the extra space is kept to be homogeneous and isotropic after introducing perturbations , so that we only need @xmath15 , the perturbation of the scale factor @xmath6 as a function of the coordinates of the ordinary space - time , to represent perturbations of the extra space . on the contrary",
    "we have no symmetry requirement for the perturbed ordinary space - time , and hence the metric perturbations @xmath22 in general is a function of all of the coordinates @xmath23 .    assuming that both the metric perturbations @xmath22 and @xmath24 are small , such that the einstein equations from the perturbed metric can be expanded with respect to these perturbations , we obtain @xmath25 \\label{expanded eintein eq } \\\\ & & = g_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(0 ) } \\left [ g_{\\mu \\nu}(t ) \\right ] + %       g_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(1 ) } \\left [ g_{\\mu \\nu}(t),\\delta g_{\\mu \\nu }                              \\left ( x \\right ) \\right ] + %       g_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(2 ) } \\left [ g_{\\mu \\nu}(t ) , b(t ) \\right ] \\\\ % & & \\quad     + g_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(3 ) } \\left [ g_{\\mu \\nu}(t ) , \\delta g_{\\mu \\nu } %                              \\left ( x \\right ) , b(t ) \\right ] + %       g_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(4 ) } \\left [ g_{\\mu \\nu}(t),\\delta g_{\\mu \\nu }                              \\left ( x \\right ) , b(t ) ,                              \\delta _ b \\left ( x^{\\mu } \\right ) \\right ] , \\nonumber % \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant in the higher - dimensional space - time , and @xmath27 denotes the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath28 the unperturbed , and @xmath29 the perturbed one .",
    "the first two terms in the above expansion of the einstein tensor , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are exactly the unperturbed and the perturbed einstein tensor , respectively , of the ordinary @xmath16-dimensional space - time .",
    "in contrast , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are additional terms coming from extra dimensions . in our point of view , if observers are too blind to see extra dimensions , these three additional terms will be automatically moved to the right - hand side of the einstein equations ( [ expanded eintein eq ] ) and treated as some sort of energy source , thereby contributing an `` effective '' part to the energy - momentum tensor . in particular",
    ", @xmath32 is smoothly distributed in the space and hence contributes to dark energy , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 have the spatial dependence and contribute to dark matter . in the above discussion",

    ". here we also focus on a matter - dominated universe , setting @xmath40 and @xmath41 to zero accordingly , but consider a more general case in which only @xmath43 is assumed while @xmath7 is treated as a free parameter . in this case",
