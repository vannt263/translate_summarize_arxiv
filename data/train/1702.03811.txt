    "@xmath0-symmetric quantum theory has its roots in a series of papers that proposed a new perturbative approach to scalar quantum field theory : instead of a conventional expansion in powers of a coupling constant , it was proposed that a perturbation parameter @xmath10 be introduced that measures the nonlinearity of the theory .",
    "thus , to solve a @xmath11 field theory one studies a @xmath12 theory and treats @xmath10 as a small parameter . after developing a perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath10 , the parameter @xmath10",
    "is set to one to obtain the results for the @xmath11 theory .",
    "this perturbative calculation is impressively accurate and does not require the coupling constant @xmath13 to be small @xcite .",
    "a crucial technical feature of this idea is that @xmath14 and not @xmath15 be raised to the power @xmath10 in order to avoid raising a negative number to a noninteger power and thereby generating complex numbers as an artifact of the procedure .    subsequently , the @xmath10 expansion was used to solve an array of nonlinear classical differential equations taken from various areas of physics : the thomas - fermi equation ( nuclear charge density ) @xmath16^{3/2}/\\sqrt{x}$ ] is modified to @xmath17^\\delta$ ] ; the lane - emdon equation ( stellar structure ) @xmath18^n=0 $ ] is modified to @xmath19^{1 + \\delta}$ ] ; the blasius equation ( fluid dynamics ) @xmath20 is modified to @xmath21^\\delta=0 $ ] ; the korteweg - de vries equation ( nonlinear waves ) @xmath22 is modified to @xmath23 . in each of these cases",
    "the quantity raised to the power delta is positive and when @xmath24 the equation becomes linear .",
    "just a few terms in the @xmath10 expansion gives an accurate numerical result @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough of @xmath0-symmetric quantum theory was the surprising discovery that to avoid the appearance of spurious complex numbers it is actually not necessary to raise a positive quantity to the power @xmath10 so long as the quantity is symmetric under combined space and time reflection .",
    "this fact is highly nontrivial and was totally unexpected .",
    "for example , a quantum - mechanical potential of form @xmath25 does not necessarily lead to complex eigenvalues because the quantity @xmath26 is @xmath0 invariant .",
    "indeed , the non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath27 has the property that its eigenvalues are entirely real , positive , and discrete when @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the reality of the spectrum was noted in refs .",
    "@xcite and was attributed to the @xmath0 symmetry of @xmath28 .",
    "dorey , dunning , and tateo proved that the spectrum is real when @xmath29 @xcite . following the observation that the eigenvalues of non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians could be real , many papers were published in which various @xmath0-symmetric model hamiltonians were studied @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians is that they often exhibit a transition from a parametric region of _ unbroken _ @xmath0 symmetry in which all of the eigenvalues are real to a region of _ broken _ @xmath0 symmetry in which some of the eigenvalues are real and the rest of the eigenvalues occur in complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "the @xmath0 transition occurs in both the classical and the quantized versions of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xcite and this transition has been observed in numerous laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "real eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath1 plotted as functions of the parameter @xmath8 . when @xmath2 ( the region of unbroken @xmath0 symmetry ) , the spectrum is real , positive , and discrete .",
    "however , as @xmath8 goes below @xmath30 ( @xmath3 is known as the region of _",
    "broken @xmath0 symmetry _ ) the real eigenvalues begin to merge pairwise and form complex - conjugate pairs .",
    "when @xmath31 , there are only a finite number of real positive eigenvalues and an infinite number of complex - conjugate pairs of eigenvalues .",
    "when @xmath32 , only one real eigenvalue survives and as @xmath8 approaches @xmath33 , this real eigenvalue becomes infinite .",
    "the behavior of the complex eigenvalues in the region of broken @xmath0 symmetry is not shown in this graph and has not been explored until now . ]    there have been many studies of the real spectrum of @xmath28 in ( [ e1 ] ) but essentially nothing has been published regarding the analytic behavior of the complex eigenvalues as functions of @xmath8 in the region of broken @xmath0 symmetry . however , it is known that there is a sequence of negative - real values of @xmath8 lying between @xmath34 and @xmath30 at which pairs of real eigenvalues become degenerate and split into pairs of complex - conjugate eigenvalues",
    ". these special values of @xmath8 are often called _ exceptional points _ @xcite . in general",
    ", eigenvalues usually have square - root branch - point singularities at exceptional points .",
    "exceptional points in the complex plane , sometimes called _ bender - wu singularities _ , explain the divergence of perturbation expansions @xcite .",
    "the appearance of exceptional points is a generic phenomenon . in these early studies of coupling - constant analyticity",
    "it was shown that the energy levels of a hamiltonian , such as the hamiltonian for the quantum anharmonic oscillator @xmath35 , are analytic continuations of one another as functions of the complex coupling constant @xmath13 due to the phenomenon of level crossing at the exceptional points .",
    "thus , the energy levels of a quantum system , which are discrete when @xmath13 is real and positive , are actually smooth analytic continuations of one another in the complex-@xmath13 plane @xcite .",
    "a simple topological picture of quantization emerges : the discrete energy levels of a hamiltonian for @xmath36 are all branches of a multivalued energy function @xmath37 and the distinct eigenvalues of this hamiltonian correspond with the sheets of the riemann surface on which @xmath37 is defined .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to vary the parameters of a hamiltonian in laboratory experiments and thus to observe _ experimentally _ the effect of encircling exceptional points @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the analytic continuation of the real eigenvalues shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] as @xmath8 moves down the negative-@xmath8 axis . in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we show that there is an _",
    "infinite - order _ exceptional point at @xmath5 where there is an elaborate logarithmic spiral ( a double helix ) of eigenvalues .",
    "the real part of each complex - conjugate pair of eigenvalues that is formed at exceptional points between @xmath5 and @xmath38 approaches @xmath39 like @xmath40 as @xmath8 approaches @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , the imaginary parts of each pair of eigenvalues vanish logarithmically at @xmath5 . as @xmath8 goes below @xmath34 ,",
    "the real parts of the eigenvalues once again become finite and the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues rise up from 0 . as @xmath8 goes from just above to just below @xmath34 , the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues appear to undergo discrete jumps but in fact they vary continuously as functions of @xmath8 .    in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we discuss the stokes wedges that characterize the eigenvalue problem as @xmath8 goes below @xmath34 .",
    "we give plots of the eigenvalues in the region @xmath41 and perform an asymptotic analysis of the eigenvalues near @xmath6 .",
    "as @xmath8 approaches @xmath42 , the entire spectrum becomes degenerate ; the real parts of all the eigenvalues approach @xmath34 and the imaginary parts coalesce to @xmath30 .",
    "section  [ s4 ] presents a numerical study of the eigenvalues in the region @xmath43 .",
    "we show that a transition occurs at @xmath44 in which the eigenspectrum goes from being discrete to becoming partially discrete and partially _",
    "continuous_. the continuous part of the spectrum lies on complex - conjugate pairs of curves in the complex-@xmath8 plane .",
    "another transition occurs at @xmath7 ( the @xmath0-symmetric coulomb potential ) ; below @xmath7 some of the discrete eigenvalues become real . as @xmath8 approaches the conformal point @xmath9 , the eigenvalues collapse to the single value 0 .",
    "section  [ s5 ] gives brief concluding remarks .",
    "the time - independent schrdinger eigenvalue problem for the hamiltonian @xmath28 in ( [ e1 ] ) is characterized by the differential equation @xmath46 the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions require that @xmath47 exponentially rapidly as @xmath48 in a pair of stokes wedges in the complex-@xmath49 plane .",
    "this subsection explains the locations of these stokes wedges .",
    "as has been previously discussed at length , the potential @xmath25 has a logarithmic singularity in the complex-@xmath49 plane when @xmath8 is not an integer .",
    "thus , it is necessary to introduce a branch cut .",
    "this branch cut is chosen to run from @xmath30 to @xmath50 in the complex-@xmath49 plane along the positive - imaginary axis because this choice respects the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is because @xmath0 symmetry translates into left - right symmetry in the complex-@xmath49 plane ( that is , mirror symmetry with respect to the imaginary-@xmath49 axis ) @xcite .",
    "the argument of @xmath49 on the principal sheet ( sheet 0 of the riemann surface ) runs from @xmath51 to @xmath52 . on sheet 1 , @xmath53 , on sheet @xmath34 , @xmath54 , and so on .    as explained in refs .",
