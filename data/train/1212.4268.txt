    "in einsteinian gravity , when quantum corrections are taken into account the determination of the cosmological constant ( cc ) , @xmath0 , is very much related with vacuum fluctuations and , eventually , the casimir effect @xcite , in one way or other @xcite .",
    "the problem of the cc is one of the most important and intriguing in modern cosmology and qft .",
    "the traditional way to understand why @xmath0 is so small ( @xmath4 in planck units ) is ordinarily based on the anthropic principle @xcite . up to now",
    "one has no reasonable alternative way to explain this fact in einsteinian gravity , unless one moves on to extended models with dynamical dark energy or modified gravities @xcite .    recently",
    "barrow and shaw @xcite suggested a non - anthropic solution to the problem : by making @xmath0 into a field and restricting the variations of the action with respect to it by causality , they managed to obtain an additional einstein constraint equation .",
    "one can say that this approach is based on a different _ interpretation _ of the cosmological constant , notably to consider the cosmological constant to be a field variable .    in the present work we use a somehow similar procedure to calculate the value of @xmath0 , namely to interpret it as an eigenvalue of a sturm - liouville problem , rather than as an integration constant .",
    "our approach is in fact more conservative than the method in @xcite since we use the standard einstein - friedmann equations _ without _ any additional constraint equation .",
    "instead , we consider one of friedmann s equations as a spectral problem and look for a class of boundary conditions which may allow us to actually calculate the corresponding eigenvalues ( in this way , our procedure is closely related to standard investigations of the casimir effect @xcite by spectral methods ) .",
    "a most simple condition is to impose that eigenfunctions be elements of @xmath1 .",
    "as we will show , this choice results in the following interesting consequence : if the universe is filled up with a matter field , @xmath5 ( except for @xmath0 ) , such that all the strong energy conditions are satisfied , then one gets a point spectrum for positive values of the cosmological constant , and a continuous spectrum for negative ones .",
    "the next step will be to consider models which actually result in a positive discrete spectrum with just one _ single _ point .",
    "this idea is inspired in the conceptual approach developed in the paper by linde and vanchurin @xcite : one can fix all the parameters in the landscape , including the value of the cosmological constant , without using any anthropic considerations , what `` will give us a chance to return to einstein s dream of a final theory , which may allow us to make sharp and unambiguous predictions despite the abundance of choices '' . clearly , this case of a one - point spectrum is a good example of a possible realization of this cherished dream .",
    "an additional bonus of our approach is the surprising connection that will be uncovered between the steinhardt - turok cyclic models @xcite and barrow s sudden singularity @xcite  or singularity of type ii according to the classification in @xcite . in short , on one hand , models with steinhardt - turok - like cyclic potentials may indeed have much to do with those singularities , and on the other hand , such models exhibit a single - point positive spectrum for @xmath0 in the framework of our approach .",
    "this striking connection will be a crucial issue in this article .",
    "a method for constructing and analyzing exact cosmological solutions of the einstein equations based on representing them as a second - order linear equation ( we call this the linearization method , in what follows ) was discussed in @xcite ( other methods for constructing exact solutions in cosmology can be found in @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that , in the case of the flat friedmann metric , the third power of the scale factor @xmath6 satisfies the equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density and @xmath9 the pressure of the matter filling the universe . in this paper",
    "we use the system of units with @xmath10 . in the case when a minimally coupled scalar field , @xmath5 , with the self - interaction potential @xmath11 , is dominant , and in the presence of a cosmological constant with density @xmath0 , eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) formally coincides with the schrdinger equation @xmath12 where the potential is @xmath13 , and the spectral parameter is @xmath14 . in ( [ schr ] ) , the quantity @xmath15 is assumed to be a function of time : @xmath16 , which has been called _ the history _ of the potential in @xcite .",
    "giving an explicit form @xmath17 together with the corresponding boundary conditions allows to find the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ schr ] ) . an important consequence of this investigation is that the regime is independent of , or just weakly dependent on the type of the potential , what is quite significant for the whole theory .",
    "unfortunately , the ubiquitous problem of the end of inflation turns out to be substantially more difficult here , and solving it in the framework of the approach described above apparently involves additional assumptions .",
    "( the authors of @xcite proposed modifying the potentials to make them depend on the temperature . stablishing a friedmann regime can then be described as a phase transition in the matter state of the early universe ) .",
    "the study of eq .",
    "( [ schr ] ) in its applications to cosmology was continued in @xcite and @xcite , where the darboux transformation was used to construct new exact solutions ( a similar technique was used in @xcite to obtain exact solutions on the brane and on the encompassing space carrying an orbifold structure ) .",
    "we consider the einstein equations in the friedmann metric , @xmath18 and assume that @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a solution of these equations , for @xmath22 .",
    "then , the function @xmath23 is a solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath24 where the `` potential '' is @xmath25 if the universe is filled up with a scalar field @xmath5 with the lagrangian @xmath26 , then @xmath27    the effectiveness of the method presented in @xcite ( and developed in @xcite and @xcite ) , precisely consists in reducing a complex nonlinear problem into a linear equation .",
    "this allows to obtain a complete set of two - parameter solutions , which exhibit inflationary behavior under very general assumptions .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 basically coincides with @xmath15 was not used anywhere in those papers and consequently played no role there . in a similar way",
    ", we here consider a generalization of this method to arbitrary @xmath29 .",
    "further to this point , the physical meaning of the `` potential '' @xmath30 is clear only for a universe filled with a scalar field .",
    "indeed , if we consider a universe in which , for instance , electromagnetic radiation is dominant , the physical meaning of the quantity @xmath30 becomes again ambiguous .",
    "we note that if a solution of ( [ schr ] ) is known , then we can use eqs .",
    "( [ ein1 ] ) and ( [ schr ] ) to find the scalar field @xmath31 and the potential @xmath32 . \\label{vt}\\ ] ] in principle we can obtain the dependence @xmath33 from these expressions , although it is clearly not always possible to do this explicitly . for example , if @xmath34 and @xmath35 then @xmath36 and @xmath37 after performing the bogoliubov transformation @xmath38 .    in the general case ,",
    "a solution of ( [ 2 ] ) has the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a linearly independent solution with the same potential : @xmath41 equation ( [ general ] ) allows to prove the following statement .",
    "* assertion*. let @xmath19 be a solution of ( [ ein1 ] ) and ( [ ein2 ] ) for @xmath22 and the corresponding @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "then , the three - parameter function @xmath42 , of the form @xmath43 is a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ ein1 ] ) and ( [ ein2 ] ) for the new energy density @xmath44 and pressure @xmath45 satisfying the condition @xmath46    finally , if we assume that the universe contains a nonzero vacuum energy with density @xmath47 , in addition to the matter fields , then eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) takes the form of the spectral problem @xmath48 where the spectral parameter is @xmath49 . just as for eq .",
    "( [ schr ] ) , we can consider a problem for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of eq .",
    "( [ scr-11 ] ) , if we specify homogeneous initial conditions . as",
    "noted in @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ schr ] ) has the form of a quantum mechanical problem with a discrete spectrum .",
    "the fact that each solution of this kind only admits a bounded or countable set of allowed values of the cosmological constant ( if we specify homogeneous initial conditions ) may help a lot to clarify the question of the actual value of the cosmological constant .",
    "it is clear that , in the case @xmath34 , the sec results in the condition @xmath50 . if one would like to obtain the discrete spectrum of @xmath0 for such potentials",
    ", one would need to suggest @xmath51 at @xmath52 and this readily means that one can get the discrete spectrum for positive values of @xmath0 only .",
    "this leads one to ask the following question : is it possible to obtain models with a discrete spectrum containing just one single point ?    for answer one",
    "need to use some boundary condition on @xmath53 . in this article",
    "we suggested that @xmath54 is element of square - integrable functional space @xmath55 .",
    "this is just the hypotheses about boundary condition .",
    "therefore , our aim looks as follows : to investigate the class of cosmologies which results in just one allowed value of vacuum energy , on conditions that @xmath54 is element of @xmath55 .",
    "we d like to understand rather physical ground which may results in this picture . in the issue , we have obtained two results , two cosmologies which admits the possibility under consideration :    \\1 ) the universe with some new form of sudden future singularity ( sec .",
    "\\2 ) the universe without exact sudden future singularity ( rather with `` smoothed singularity '' ) but filled with scalar field @xmath5 with deep narrow self - acting potential @xmath11 ( sec .",
    "such potential is very similar with cyclic potential of steinhardt - turok ( st ) except that the st cyclic potential @xmath11 has a different asymptotic behavior at @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , to obtain st potential ( and breathe the life into our formal model ! ) one need to modified the model from the sec .",
    "we do it in the sec .",
    "thus , we have two cosmologies which allows one to obtain the extreme form of non - anthropic solution of the problem of cosmological constant .",
    "remarkably , these cosmologies are not absolutely new , speculative models ; vice versa , these cosmologies are connected with two well known and popular ( at present ) models ; barrow sudden future singularities and steinhardt - turok cyclic models . and last , but not least : these two models are connected to each other by the following way - the sudden model ( sec .",
    "3 ) may be obtained from the `` st '' models by the limiting process .",
    "we assume that the matter field contains baryons , that there is also radiation and dark matter , and that the dark matter leads to a sudden future singularity at @xmath57 , namely @xmath58 for the realization ( [ sfs ] ) , let us choose the dark matter pressure to be of the form : @xmath59 hence , @xmath60 is the `` regular '' part of the function @xmath61 , while @xmath62 is a positive constant . from the equation of state for the dark matter ,",
    "@xmath63 , in which @xmath64 , it follows that @xmath65 .",
    "then , for the energy density and pressure , we have @xmath66 the contribution of the dark matter decreases with time for @xmath67 . for @xmath68 , @xmath69 and we can neglect @xmath70 in the equations .",
    "therefore , eq .   ( [ scr-11 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath71 let us now assume that the function @xmath72 is continuous at the point @xmath57 .",
    "the first derivative of the scale factor has a gap at the time of occurrence of the sudden future singularity , and @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 . from the physical point of view",
    ", this gap corresponds to a density jump in the singularity .",
    "one gets , @xmath76 for simplicity one can set @xmath77 . therefore ,",
    "if the universe expands before the time @xmath57 , then at time @xmath57 contraction begins .",
    "it is clear that the solutions for @xmath67 and @xmath78 can not be connected .",
    "but it is interesting to investigate this model further .",
    "the condition ( [ jump-1 ] ) at @xmath77 leads to @xmath79 therefore , the density at the time of sfs is given by @xmath80 .",
    "one notes that for the open universe the following condition should be satisfied @xmath81 solving ( [ 8 ] ) with the conditions @xmath82 and @xmath83 yields @xmath84 therefore , the value of @xmath0 is unique and , for the vacuum energy density , we have @xmath85 condition ( [ condopen ] ) can be written as follows @xmath86",
    "strictly speaking , the model in the previous section has no physical sense .",
    "this is because one had to consider two different universes ( with positive and negative hubble roots , respectively ) separated by the singularity .",
    "one needs to involve a smoothed `` singularity '' , such that @xmath87 , but @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "let us take @xmath90 if @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 and taking into account that @xmath93 one concludes that @xmath94 the potential as a function of time , for various values of @xmath95 , is depicted on fig .",
    "1 . therefore , for @xmath96 the potential ( [ ssfs ] ) leads to a sudden future singularity , as considered above .",
    "we assume that @xmath97 but @xmath98 .",
    "the solution of ( [ scr-11 ] ) , for the potential ( [ ssfs ] ) , can be written in the form @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the hypergeometric function , and we have used the following definitions : @xmath101 the condition @xmath102 corresponds to @xmath103 .",
    "finiteness of the function requires that @xmath104 and , therefore , for the spectrum @xmath105 for @xmath91 , one can easily show that @xmath106 but there is the condition that @xmath107 ( as for @xmath108 the function ( [ psi - ssfs ] ) diverges at @xmath109 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath110 and from eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) one has @xmath111 for sufficiently large @xmath112 this inequality can be satisfied for @xmath113 only .",
    "the remaining single eigenvalue is given by @xmath114 and , in this limit , one gets for the cosmological constant this same value .    for the eigenfunctions ( [ psi - ssfs ] ) @xmath115 and the hubble parameter is @xmath116 for the matter pressure and density , we get @xmath117 the evolution of the scalar field can be obtained from the condition @xmath118 , @xmath119 for simplicity , we choose the `` + '' sign in ( [ phissfs ] ) and set @xmath120 .",

    "it is our conclusion that in a more realistic case one will obtain a potential for the scalar field similar to the potentials in cyclic models .",

    "( [ cond ] ) it follows that @xmath186 .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the proof that , considering the cosmological constant @xmath0 as an eigenvalue of a sturm - liouville problem allows one to obtain a set of admissible values for @xmath0 . in the special case of a situation with discrete spectrum containing only one point , there is the possibility to strictly determine the cosmological conditions leading to this value of @xmath0 without recurring to the anthropic principle .",
    "we have shown in detail that this possibility is indeed realized in cyclic cosmological models when the potential of the matter field is similar to the potential of the scalar field .",

    "<S> it is observed that one of einstein - friedmann s equations has formally the aspect of a sturm - liouville problem , and that the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , plays thereby the role of spectral parameter ( what hints to its connection with the casimir effect ) </S>",
    "<S> . the subsequent formulation of appropriate boundary conditions leads to a set of admissible values for @xmath0 , considered as eigenvalues of the corresponding linear operator . </S>",
    "<S> simplest boundary conditions are assumed , namely that the eigenfunctions belong to @xmath1 space , with the result that , when all energy conditions are satisfied , they yield a discrete spectrum for @xmath2 and a continuous one for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a very interesting situation is seen to occur when the discrete spectrum contains only one point : then , there is the possibility to obtain appropriate cosmological conditions without invoking the anthropic principle . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility is shown to be realized in cyclic cosmological models , provided the potential of the matter field is similar to the potential of the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the universe in this case contains a sudden future singularity .    </S>",
