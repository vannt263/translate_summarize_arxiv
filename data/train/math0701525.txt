    "the background for this article is the observation in @xcite*section  3 that the algebra @xmath13 of _ smooth _ functions on a totally disconnected locally compact group @xmath0 is a _ multiplier hopf @xmath7-algebra _ as defined in @xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to classify all multiplier hopf @xmath7-algebras which are commutative or co - commutative ; this is the same as answering the following question : when does @xmath1 or @xmath2 have a dense multiplier hopf @xmath7-algebra ? it is well known that the answer is yes if @xmath0 is compact or discrete and the main results of section   and section   are that in general the answer is yes if and only if @xmath0 has a compact open subgroup .",
    "if so , such a multiplier hopf @xmath7-algebra is unique and can be described explicitly as the algebra of polynomial functions on @xmath0 .",
    "we believe that multiplier hopf @xmath7-algebras in general are the right framework for studying totally disconnected locally compact quantum groups ( what ever that is ) and it is therefore natural to first give a complete account for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "is a little more tricky . for @xmath1",
    "one can quickly show that elements of a multiplier hopf @xmath7-subalgebra must have compact support and are therefore integrable .",
    "it is not so easy to show that elements of a multiplier hopf @xmath7-subalgebra of @xmath2 automatically are integrable with respect to the haar - plancherel weight .",
    "however , when this is proved , the results for @xmath2 follow from those of @xmath1 . in fact , we show that if @xmath14 is the unique dense multiplier hopf @xmath7-algebra of @xmath1 and @xmath15 denotes the left regular representation , then @xmath16 is the unique dense multiplier hopf @xmath7-algebra of @xmath2 .    for @xmath17",
    "the situation is different . here",
    "the existence of a multiplier hopf @xmath7-subalgebra does not imply that @xmath0 has a compact open subgroup .",
    "however , the corresponding uniqueness result is true .",
    "the algebras @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dual as locally compact quantum groups and we shall also see that many properties of this duality are equivalent with the existence of a compact open subgroup",
    ".    it is well known that if @xmath8 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 is the the corresponding multiplication operator on @xmath4 , then @xmath9 is compact . since the finite rank operators are dense in the algebra of compact operators it is natural to ask when @xmath18 is of finite rank .",
    "we show this is possible if and only if @xmath0 has a compact open subgroup .",
    "it is a consequence of the heisenberg relations that if @xmath19 then @xmath20 and @xmath5 as above never commute unless one of them is zero .",
    "we show that in general @xmath21 is possible if and only if @xmath0 has a compact open subgroup .    finally , as a bonus for the patient reader we look at the case where @xmath0 is abelian and ask whether one can have @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24",
