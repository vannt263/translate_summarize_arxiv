    "( b ) phase diagram in the cf splitting ( @xmath97)-temperature ( @xmath99 ) space for @xmath152 . , width=321 ]    because of the relevance for fulleride compounds , it is also interesting to consider the half - filled ( @xmath111 ) three orbital model with negative hund coupling @xcite .",
    "in addition to the magnetic moment defined in the last subsection , we consider two kinds of orbital moments defined by @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are gell - mann matrices .",
    "these orbital orders are degenerate for @xmath121 , but become different in the presence of cf splitting . for the parameter range considered in this paper ,",
    "the orbital order with @xmath156 is more stable than the other , so we plot only the phase boundaries for @xmath156 .",
    "figure [ fig : phase_nj](a ) shows the @xmath17-@xmath97 phase diagram at @xmath149 and @xmath74 .",
    "although this ratio of @xmath81 is much larger than the estimate for alkali - doped fullerides @xcite , it is suitable for clarifying the qualitative behaviors originating from the negative hund coupling . without any long - range order , we have three kinds of states depending on the parameters . in the small and large @xmath17 regions ,",
    "metallic and mott insulating states are realized , respectively . for sufficiently large cf splitting",
    ", a new state appears in - between , which is a metallic state with a completely empty ( occupied ) orbital for @xmath133 ( @xmath129 ) @xcite .",
    "now we discuss the ordered states .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom are activated by the negative hund coupling and are ordered in a staggered manner as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_nj](a ) .",
    "orbital order with @xmath156 moments is the dominant phase near @xmath139 . for large @xmath17 , antiferromagnetism",
    "is also stabilized , which is explained by the still remaining active spin degrees of freedom in the half - filled system .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_nj ] , the intra - orbital spin - singlet pairing with @xmath157 is realized in the intermediate @xmath17 region .",
    "this pairing is also caused by the negative hund coupling , which favors doubly occupied orbitals .",
    "the other pairings with @xmath158 are less stable ( see filled pentagons in the figure ) as discussed before . for small @xmath97 ,",
    "this superconducting state is covered by the orbital order . with increasing cf splitting",
    ", we find a region between the orbital ordered phase and the occupied / unoccupied orbital metal , where the @xmath157 pairing state is most stable .",
    "the transition temperature as a function of @xmath97 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_nj](b ) .",
    "it is notable that the transition temperature is slightly enhanced by the cf splitting .",
    "this enhancement can be intuitively interpreted again as resulting from the suppression of fluctuations among orbitals and increasing probability of pair formation .",
    "at the same time , for @xmath129 the mobility of the pairs is reduced , so that the @xmath0 is almost independent of @xmath97 . for @xmath159 ,",
    "on the other hand , the probability of pair formation instead of the mobility of pairs is decreased , to give the exactly same result as in the @xmath127 case .",
    "the @xmath160 pairing state disappears when orbital @xmath161 becomes fully occupied or empty .",
    "finally we discuss the effect of the parameter @xmath148 . in the @xmath108 case ,",
    "the pair hopping is relevant and the spin - flip is not . according to ref .  , the pair hopping substantially enhances the intra - orbital spin - singlet pairing .",
    "hence the transition temperature should increase for @xmath162 , which is in contrast to the @xmath70 case . while the realistic value of @xmath18 is tiny ( @xmath163 for fullerides @xcite ) , the pairing from negative hund coupling has this advantage and has a chance to be realized in systems with anisotropic interaction .",
    "the effect of the increasing orbital fluctuations on the intra - orbital spin - singlet superconducting state for @xmath162 , however , remains to be investigated .",
    "we have presented a systematic analysis of the electronic ordering instabilities in two- and tree - orbital hubbard models .",
    "we have used dmft in combination with a numerically exact hybridization expansion impurity solver and a semi - circular density of states .",
    "our results thus represent the generic phase diagrams of high - dimensional lattice models , irrespective of details of the bandstructure . only uniform and staggered order parameters",
    "have been considered , and we focused on the intermediate coupling regime , which is relevant for most unconventional multi - band superconductors and can not be accessed reliably by approximate methods such as the fluctuation - exchange approximation .    in the case with positive hund coupling",
    ", we found instabilities to antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders , spin - orbital order and orbital - singlet spin - triplet superconductivity . in the model with negative hund coupling we identified antiferro orbital order , antiferromagnetism , and intra - orbital spin - singlet pairing .",
    "we have shown how symmetry relations can be used to connect some of these ordered phases , and to understand the cooper pairings in three - orbital models with cf splittings .    in particular , we showed that in the two - orbital model with @xmath77 , the orbitally degenerate system away from half - filling can be mapped exactly onto the half - filled system with cf splitting , and that the orbital - singlet spin - triplet superconductivity in the former system corresponds to spin - orbital order in the latter . the qualitative correspondence between these at first sight different physical situations can be expected to hold in a wider parameter regime . since the fluctuating local moments at the border of the spin - frozen metal regime play a crucial role in stabilizing the spin - triplet superconducting state , and the spin moments are unaffected by the mapping , this symmetry argument also implies that fluctuating moments drive the instability to spin - orbital order .",
    "thus the diagonal and offdiagonal orders can be understood in a unified manner .",
    "crystal field splittings of the  2/1 \" type in the three orbital model can have a surprising effect on the superconducting state . in the spin - triplet state with filling @xmath82 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the most stable pairs are always formed in the two degenerate orbitals , even if the energy of these orbitals is increased by the cf . on the other hand , in the half - filled spin - singlet state with @xmath70 , the most stable pairs are always formed in the non - degenerate orbital , irrespective of the sign of the cf .",
    "we explained this behavior using a particle - hole transformation , and also gave an intuitive interpretation based on fluctuations of the condensate and mobility of cooper pairs .",
    "the use of symmetry relations is also interesting from a computational point of view , since the rotational invariance of the slater - kanamori interaction allows to express certain four - point correlation functions in terms of others which can be easily measured in standard hybridization expansion monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "this trick however fails as soon as the rotational invariance is broken , e.g. by the presence of cf splittings . whether or not it is possible to extend this technique to more general situations by exploiting additional symmetries is an interesting open problem .",
    "an alternative strategy is to directly measure all types of four - point correlation functions using a worm sampling algorithm @xcite .",
    "our three - orbital calculations with filling @xmath82 ( equivalent to @xmath146 ) can be regarded as toy model simulations of sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 .",
    "this material is a quasi-2d system with tetragonal symmetry and has a `` 2/1 '' type cf splitting .",
    "while the cf splitting quickly suppresses the superconductivity in the non - degenerate orbital , the pairing between the degenerate orbitals is robust .",
    "our calculations are consistent with a fluctuating - moment induced spin - triplet superconductivity in this compound , which has a partial orbital degeneracy ( @xmath164 and @xmath165 orbitals ) . more accurate simulations would need to take into account the realistic bandstructure .",
    "the half - filled three - orbital model with negative hund coupling is of interest in connection with fulleride compounds , where the jahn - teller screening of the small @xmath18 leads to a stabilization of the low - spin states @xcite .",
    "the effect of cf splitting is to further stabilize the spin - singlet pairing in the non - degenerate orbital , and to suppress a competing orbital ordered phase .",
    "while the @xmath18 parameters used in our study are larger than the ab - initio estimates @xcite , this finding has some implications on the recently reported light - induced superconductivity in k@xmath4c@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the enhanced @xmath0 , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the driving of a phonon of @xmath166 symmetry leads to an essentially static distortion of the c@xmath5 molecules , and hence a splitting of the initially degenerate molecular orbitals .",
    "our result shows that this splitting , if studied within an equilibrium formalism , can contribute to a slightly enhanced pairing .",
    "the related effect of orbital differentiation in the interaction parameters still needs to be systematically explored .",
    "given the large enhancement of @xmath0 observed in the experiments , one may speculate that the @xmath18 parameter is effectively modified in the driven state ( enhanced dynamical jahn - teller effect ) .",

    "the form of the green function is the same as the one obtained in ref .  .",
    "for interacting systems , the local self - energy @xmath186 is included by the replacement @xmath187 .",
    "we define the two - particle green functions without vertex parts by @xmath188 which are relevant to uniform and staggered susceptibilities , respectively . here",
    "@xmath189 is a sign which depends on the sublattice . substituting the results in the previous subsection",
    ", we obtain @xmath190 this leads to the simpler expressions @xmath191 thus we derive the uniform and staggered components of two - particle green functions .",

    "we do not have to know the specific form of @xmath197 , and only assume the existence of a vector @xmath198 defined by @xmath199 .",
    "we also introduce the @xmath200-dependent two - particle green function by @xmath201 using eq .",
    ", one can show the relations @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "thus the pseudo wave vectors @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to the uniform and staggered components , respectively .",
    "namely , the bethe lattice can be partly handled as if it were a simple cubic lattice which has the same relation @xmath199 with the staggered ordering vector @xmath204 .",
    "note that this analogy is valid only for the uniform and staggered components .",
    "let us physically interpret the orbital and spin - orbital moments in terms of doubly degenerate e@xmath66 orbitals for @xmath175 electrons under the cubic symmetry .",
    "the wave functions are written as @xmath205 in the right - hand side is the eigenstate of the angular momentum @xmath206 .",
    "with use of this expression , we can show the relations @xmath207 where the overline symmetrizes the product of operators as e.g. @xmath208 .",
    "this can be shown by standard quantum mechanics calculations for angular momentum .",
    "thus @xmath209 and @xmath210 are rank 2 operators , while @xmath67 is a rank 3 operator . for the spin - orbital moment",
    ", we further put the spin moment on the orbital moment @xmath211 , and hence the rank of the operator is increased by one .",
