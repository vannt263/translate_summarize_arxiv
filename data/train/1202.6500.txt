    "it is well known that the classic works of tolman @xcite and of oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite , for short tov , addresses the problem of neutron star equilibrium configurations composed only of neutrons . for the more general case",
    "when protons and electrons are also considered , in all of the scientific literature on neutron stars it is assumed that the condition of local charge neutrality applies identically to all points of the equilibrium configuration ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the corresponding solutions in this more general case of a non - rotating neutron star , are systematically obtained also on the base of the tov equations .    in general ,",
    "the formulation of the equilibrium of systems composed by different particle species must be established within the framework of statistical physics of multicomponent systems ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium of these systems is warrantied by demanding the constancy throughout the configuration of the generalized chemical potentials , often called `` electro - chemical '' , of each of the components of the system ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "such generalized potentials include not only the contribution due to kinetic energy but also the contribution due to the potential fields , e.g. gravitational and electromagnetic potential energies per particle , and in the case of rotating stars also the centrifugal potential",
    ". for such systems in presence of gravitational and coulomb fields , global electric polarization effects at macroscopic scales occur .",
    "the balance of the gravitational and electric forces acting on ions and electrons in ideal electron - ion plasma leading to the occurrence of gravito - polarization was pointed out in the classic work of s.  rosseland @xcite .    if one turns to consider the gravito - polarization effects in neutron stars , the corresponding theoretical treatment acquires remarkable conceptual and theoretical complexity , since it must be necessarily formulated consistently within the einstein - maxwell system of equations .",
    "o.  klein , in @xcite , first introduced the constancy of the general relativistic chemical potential of particles , hereafter `` klein potentials '' , in the study of the thermodynamic equilibrium of a self - gravitating one - component fluid of neutral particles throughout the configuration within the framework of general relativity .",
    "the extension of the klein s work to the case of neutral multicomponent degenerate fluids can be found in and to the case of multi - component degenerate fluid of charged particles in @xcite .    using the concept of klein potentials",
    ", we have recently proved the impossibility of imposing the condition of local charge neutrality in the simplest case of a self - gravitating system of degenerate neutrons , protons and electrons in @xmath12-equilibrium @xcite : it has been shown that the consistent treatment of the above system implies the solution of the general relativistic thomas - fermi equations , coupled with the einstein - maxwell ones , being the tov equations thus superseded .",
    "we have recently formulated the theory of a system of neutrons , protons and electrons fulfilling strong , electromagnetic , weak and gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "the role of the klein first integrals has been again evidenced and their theoretical formulation in the einstein - maxwell background and in the most general case of finite temperature has been there presented , generalizing the previous results for the `` non - interacting '' case @xcite .",
    "the strong interactions , modeled by a relativistic nuclear theory , are there described by the introduction of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 virtual mesons @xcite ( see subsec .",
    "[ subsec : core ] for details ) .    in this article",
    "we construct for the first time the equilibrium configurations of non - rotating neutron stars following the new approach , @xcite .",
    "the full set of the einstein - maxwell - thomas - fermi equations is solved numerically for zero temperatures and for selected parameterizations of the nuclear model .",
    "we use units with @xmath13 throughout the article .",
    "it has been clearly recognized that , since neutron stars cores may reach density of order @xmath14@xmath15 g/@xmath10 , much larger than the nuclear density @xmath16 g/@xmath10 , approaches for the nuclear interaction between nucleons based on phenomenological potentials and non - relativistic many - body theories become inapplicable ( see @xcite ) . a self - consistent relativistic and well - tested model for the nuclear interactions",
    "has been formulated in @xcite . within this model",
    "the nucleons interact with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons through yukawa - like couplings and assuming flat spacetime the equation of state of nuclear matter has been determined .",
    "however , it has been clearly stated in @xcite that , when we turn into a neutron star configuration at nuclear and supranuclear , the global description of the einstein - maxwell - thomas - fermi equations is mandatory . associated to this system of equations there is a sophisticated eigenvalue problem , especially the one for the general relativistic thomas - fermi equation is necessary in order to fulfill the global charge neutrality of the system and to consistently describe the confinement of the ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "the strong interactions between nucleons are described by the exchange of three virtual mesons : @xmath0 is an isoscalar meson field providing the attractive long - range part of the nuclear force ; @xmath1 is a massive vector field that models the repulsive short range and ; @xmath2 is the massive isovector field that takes account surface as well as isospin effects of nuclei ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "we adopt the lorenz gauge for the fields @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
