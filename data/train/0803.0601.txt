    "the two sets of ample , good quality , experimental data of kaon photoproduction @xmath8 provided recently by the saphir  @xcite and clas  @xcite collaborations lead to not only a new opportunity to study the dynamics of kaon and hyperon interactions in a great detail , but also a puzzling point : why there exist discrepancies between the two data sets in the @xmath8 channel , whereas in the @xmath9 channel the extracted data from the two collaborations agree quite well ?",
    "many recent efforts have been devoted to analyze the consequence of the data discrepancies in the @xmath8 process ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown by refs .",
    "@xcite that the use of saphir and clas data , individually or simultaneously , leads to quite different extracted photo - coupling parameters .",
    "therefore , ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that current data situation does not allow for a precise determination of the resonance parameters or for the search of the `` missing resonances '' .    by studying the statistical properties of the two data sets ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the clas data are in good agreement with the leps data  @xcite , whereas the saphir data are coherently shifted down with respect to both clas and leps data , especially at forward kaon angles .",
    "the relative - global - scaling factor between the saphir and clas data has been found to be 1.13 .",
    "although results of the recent works could reveal certain consequences of using saphir or clas data in the database , it is still difficult to determine which data set should be used to obtain a reliable phenomenological model as well as to extract the correct resonance parameters .",
    "the reason is that in all analyses the experimental data are fitted by adjusting a set of free parameters , while the precise values of these parameters are not well known .",
    "furthermore , the extracted parameters are not unique and also sensitive to the number of resonances used in a model . here",
    ", it is important to note that due to the high - energy threshold it is difficult to identify which resonances are dominant in this reaction .    in view of this",
    ", it is important to consider other quantities which can be predicted by the models and can be directly compared with the results from other measurements or model predictions .",
    "one of the possible quantities is the contribution of the @xmath8 channel to the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule .",
    "previous calculations based on isobar models  @xcite have estimated that kaon photoproductions on the proton contribute about @xmath10b to the gdh integral .",
    "actually , to arrive at a correct gdh sum rule prediction one merely needs about @xmath11 @xmath12b contribution from kaon - hyperon final states ( see table i of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , the clas collaboration released a set of experimental data on the beam - recoil polarization observables @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "these data indicate that the @xmath13 polarization is predominantly in the direction of the spin of the incoming photon , independent of the c.m .",
    "energy or the kaon scattering angle . by using a circularly polarized photon beam the polarization of the recoiling hyperon is measured .",
    "the measured polarization is defined through the relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the induced ( recoil ) polarization of the hyperon .",
    "we note that for a circularly polarized beam this polarization is bounded to be less than or equal to one  @xcite . when integrated over all production angles and total c.m .",
    "energies , the clas data gives @xmath16 however , this result seems to be difficult to explain . reference  @xcite tried to explain this phenomenon by means of a simple quark model . within this approach ,",
    "the real photon converts to an @xmath17 pair as part of the interaction in the complex gluon field of the nucleon .",
    "the pair carries the polarization of the photon .",
    "the s quark of the pair merges with the @xmath18 quarks of the proton to form a @xmath13 .",
    "the s quark in the @xmath13 retains its full polarization after being precessed by a spin - orbit interaction , while the @xmath19 quark merges with the remnant @xmath20 quark and ends up in the spinless kaon . using this model ref .",
    "@xcite is able to qualitatively explain the phenomenon .",
    "however , as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , in this approach the @xmath21-channel baryon resonances can not play an important role , since the @xmath17 pair is created in the initial state .",
    "this is in contrary to the fact that kaon photoproduction is dominated by the resonance contributions .",
    "moreover , the approach is unable to reproduce the qualitative features of the @xmath9 process  @xcite .",
    "based on these facts , it is certainly interesting to include the clas @xmath1 and @xmath2 data in the present analysis and to investigate the effects of the data inclusion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ gdh - sum - rule ]",
    "we present the formalism of the gdh sum rule .",
    "section  [ multipole - model ] briefly explains the multipole model used in the data analysis .",
    "section  [ contribution - to - gdh ] presents the results before we include the clas @xmath1 and @xmath2 data in our analysis .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of these data will be demonstrated in section  [ after_incl ] .",
    "we will summarize our findings in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the gdh sum rule @xcite relates the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon @xmath22 to the difference of its polarized total photoabsorption cross sections . for the case of proton",
    "the sum rule reads @xmath23\\ , , \\label{eq : igdh0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 indicate the cross sections for the possible combinations of spins of the proton ( 1/2 ) and the photon ( 1 ) , @xmath26 the photoproduction threshold lab energy , @xmath27 the fine structure constant , and @xmath28 the proton mass .    for unpolarized photoproduction experiments",
    "the total cross section @xmath29 can be related to the spin dependent cross sections by @xmath30 while for the photoproduction from the polarized photon beam and polarized proton target , @xmath31 one can also measure @xmath32 the latter is obviously the suitable observable for the sum rule . however , since there has been no available measurement of the reaction given in eq .",
    "( [ reaction ] ) yet , eq .",
    "( [ sigtt ] ) should be estimated from a reliable model which fits all available unpolarized experimental data .    for the sake of comparison",
    ", we follow the notation of ref.@xcite and define the gdh integral @xmath33\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : igdh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this definition , the gdh sum rule for the proton yields @xmath34 the first estimate based on the then existing data led to @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the latest result calculated from a combination of pion photoproduction and photon absorption processes yields a value of @xmath36 @xmath12b @xcite , thus , although it slightly overestimates the sum rule , it is still consistent within the present error bar .",
    "however , one can also calculate the @xmath37 by summing up all possible photoproduction processes .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is found that in order to arrive at a consistent result , an estimate of + 4 @xmath12b contribution should come from kaon photoproduction processes on the proton . by using kaon - maid it can be shown that a slightly smaller value of @xmath38 @xmath12b can be expected from these associated strangeness processes , where the three separate contributions refer to the @xmath0 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 channels @xcite . the small contribution from the @xmath40 channel",
    "can be understood from the fact that the cross section of this channel is substantially smaller than those of the @xmath0 and @xmath39 channels ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the latest measurement of the @xmath40 channel  @xcite shows that the corresponding cross section is even smaller than that reported in ref .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of the kaon - hyperon final states to the gdh sum rule for the case of the proton probably comes only from the @xmath0 and @xmath39 channels .    with the knowledge of @xmath7 we can also calculate the corresponding contribution to the forward spin polarizability of the proton , @xmath41\\ ,",
    "\\label{eq : forward_polar}\\ ] ] the precise value of this observable is currently less known , since there is no sign that calculations from chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) would converge in this case .",
    "for instance , the isobar model of ref.@xcite predicts @xmath42 ( in @xmath43 @xmath44 ) , whereas the analysis from chpt to order @xmath45 obtains a value of @xmath46 @xcite and an extension to @xmath47 yields @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the latest value obtained from photoabsorption experiment @xcite is @xmath49 @xmath44 . in spite of this enormous uncertainty",
    "it is important to note that ref .",
    "@xcite estimates a small contribution from the @xmath50 channels , i.e. @xmath51 @xmath44 , in spite of the fact that the @xmath52 channel could have total a cross section up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of kaon channels .",
    "one of the most recent models of the @xmath0 photoproduction which fits all recent - experimental data , in a wide range of kinematics , from threshold up to @xmath53 gev is the recent multipole model given in ref .",
    "the model consists of the background terms which are constructed from a series of tree - level feynman diagrams and the resonance terms which are assumed to have the breit - wigner form . to account for hadronic structures of interacting baryons and mesons the appropriate hadronic form factors",
    "are included in hadronic vertices in a gauge - invariant fashion .",
    "details of the ingredient of the model can be found in ref .",
    "a number of free parameters in the background and resonance terms are adjusted by fitting the calculated observables to experimental data . due to the problem of the data discrepancies ,",
    "two models have been proposed in ref .",
    "the first model fits the combination of the saphir and leps data ( hereafter referred to as fit 1a ) and the second one fits the combination of the clas and leps data ( hereafter referred to as fit 2a ) . before the inclusion of the clas beam - recoil polarization data @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in total",
    ", 834 data points were fitted in the first case and 1694 data points were fitted in the second case . to further analyze the physical consequence of the data discrepancy",
    ", we have refitted this multipole model solely to the saphir data ( 750 data points ) or clas data ( 1377 data points ) .",
    "the results are referred to as fit 1 ( fits to the saphir data ) and fit 2 ( fits to the clas data ) .",
    "the clas beam - recoil polarization data @xmath1 and @xmath2 consists of 320 data points .",
    "the results after the inclusion of these data will be presented in section  [ after_incl ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : total ] displays the comparison between the predicted total cross sections @xmath29 and experimental data in the upper panel .",
    "predictions for the @xmath7 total cross section are given in the lower panel of the same figure .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we also present the prediction of kaon - maid ( indicated by maid in the figure ) .    since the number of experimental data used in the new fits ( fit 1 and fit 2 ) is smaller , it is understandable that the agreement between experimental data and model predictions is better in this case . the predictions for the @xmath7 show , however , quite different behaviors for different models .",
    "the differences between fit 1 and fit 1a ( as well as between fit 2 and fit 2a ) originate from the differences in the fitted ( resonance ) parameters , thus , reflecting the differences in the resonance roles in explaining the process .",
    "nevertheless , the gross behaviors of fit 1 and fit 1a are almost the same . the same feature is also displayed by fit 2 and fit 2a .",
    "the main difference is , whereas fit 1 and fit 1a do not cross the zero axis , fit 2 and fit 2a change their signs at @xmath54 gev .",
    "based on this result we can then expect smaller @xmath37 values in the case of fit 2 and fit 2a ( the case of using clas data ) .",
    ".contributions of the @xmath8 channel to the gdh sum rule for the proton in @xmath12b and to the forward spin polarizability @xmath55 in @xmath56 @xmath44 .",
    "note that the numerical values of the @xmath37 refer to @xmath57 in eq.([eq : igdh ] ) .",
    "for comparison , the gdh sum rule yields the value of @xmath58 @xmath12b , while ref.@xcite estimates a value of @xmath59 @xmath12b for all kaon photoproduction channels on the proton . on the other hand",
    ", ref.@xcite obtains a value of @xmath60 @xmath44 for the contribution from single pion photoproduction below 1.6 gev to the @xmath55 .",
    "the number of fitted data @xmath61 and the corresponding @xmath62 per degrees of freedom are also given.[tab : num_res ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the total cross sections @xmath29 and @xmath7 of the refitted models display an interesting result . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigttp_cxcz ] , the inclusion of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data emphasizes our previous finding ; the models which fitted the clas differential cross section data predicts a ( more ) negative contribution to the gdh sum rule .",
    "the numerical results given in table  [ tab : num_resx ] show this explicitely .",
    "given that there is no discrepancy between the saphir and clas @xmath39 data , so that the previous result of the @xmath39 channel is still valid , and the contribution of the @xmath40 channel can be neglected , we can conclude that models which fit the clas differential cross section data ( fit 2x and fit 2ax ) tend to eliminate the contribution of kaon - hyperon final states to the gdh sum rule .",
    "it is also important to briefly discuss the differences between the predicted @xmath7 before and after the inclusion of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data ( shown in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : total ] and [ fig : sigttp_cxcz ] ) . after the inclusion of the beam - recoil data the total cross sections @xmath7 show less structures .",
    "presumably , the clas @xmath1 and @xmath2 data select certain resonances as the important ones . to investigate this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : res_cont ] we plot contributions of the background terms and several important resonances to the total cross section @xmath7 before and after the inclusion of the beam - recoil observables .",
    "although the phenomenon is observed in all four fits , we only compare fit 1a and fit 1ax because the effect of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 inclusion is more dramatic in this case .    by comparing the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : res_cont ] we can conclude that the inclusion of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data does not influence the background sector of the model . in the resonance sector , this inclusion emphasizes the roles of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 resonances .",
    "the result of the present work , therefore , corroborates the finding of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite about the evidence of the @xmath6 resonance , who also used the clas @xmath1 and @xmath2 data in their analysis .",
    "we note that this analysis has been further reexamined in a great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that the @xmath6 resonance is essential to achieve a good quality of the fit , especially for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data .",
    "it is also important to note that ref .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that this resonance is important if the clas differential cross section data were used . with the same quantum states ,",
    "another important resonance is the @xmath5 .",
    "reference  @xcite also found that this resonance belongs to the four strongest contributors to the @xmath63 reaction .",
    "the importance of the @xmath3 in the photoproduction of @xmath0 is quite clear because the @xmath21-wave contribution dominates the threshold of this process  @xcite .",
    "this has been also discussed in the previous works  @xcite .    apparently , the only different result obtained here is the importance of the @xmath4 state .",
    "most recent studies  @xcite found that this resonance has a negligible effect on the @xmath63 reaction , in spite of the fact that this resonance has long been used in the isobar models of kaon photoproduction  @xcite . although its contribution could be smaller than those of the @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 resonances , fig .",
    "[ fig : res_cont ] recommends that a further detailed study of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data is urgently required to shed more light on the role of the @xmath4 state .",
    "finally , we should mention that due to the nature of the prediction here , experimental measurement of the @xmath7 is urgently required to verify the current findings .",
    "since the saphir detector has been dismantled , measurements of the @xmath7 by the clas , leps , and mami collaborations seem to be the only choice .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the contribution of the kaon photoproduction @xmath8 channel to the gdh sum rule by means of multipole models which fit the new saphir or clas data .",
    "our findings indicate that the saphir and clas data yield very different contributions to the gdh sum rule .",
    "contribution of this channel to the forward spin polarizability of the proton recommends a further analysis of the contribution from the @xmath50 channels .",
    "the inclusion of the recent clas @xmath1 and @xmath2 data does not dramatically change this conclusion . the result of the fits that include these data supports the previous finding that the @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 resonances are essential for the @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "future measurements of the @xmath7 by the clas , leps , and mami collaborations , are expected to confirm this conclusion .",
