    "for the formation of gravitationally bound objects such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies , the current paradigm is hierarchical formation based on the cold dark matter model .",
    "the cold dark matter induces significant small - scale fluctuations in the initial field .",
    "since the first objects arise from these initial fluctuations , they are not so massive .",
    "they merge with one another via gravitational clustering in a hierarchy , evolving successively into more massive objects .",
    "we analytically discuss some statistical properties of this hierarchical object formation via the gravitational clustering .",
    "the existing analytical studies are based on the density field , following the pioneering works of press & schechter ( 1974 ; see also peebles 1980 ) , bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and bond et al .",
    "they smoothed the initial density field over a scale that corresponds to a given class of objects .",
    "this is because , even when objects are formed at a scale , the larger - scale density field retains its initial pattern , according to the eulerian linear theory .",
    "the smoothed initial density field was used to study the gravitational clustering of those objects .",
    "our study is based on the peculiar - velocity field , which is expected to offer new information on the gravitational clustering . over scales where objects have not been formed , the peculiar - velocity field retains its initial pattern , according to the lagrangian linear theory , i.e. , the zeldovich approximation ( za ; zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "the initial fluctuations are random gaussian . for such fluctuations ,",
    "there are statistical measures ( rice 1954 , ",
    "we apply these measures to the smoothed initial peculiar - velocity field .",
    "the gravitational clustering reflects the cosmological parameters .",
    "we use their latest standard values : the hubble constant @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , the cosmological constant @xmath8 , the matter density @xmath9 , and the baryon density @xmath10 ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the definitions and equations are summarized in  [ s2 ] .",
    "we discuss the general features of the hierarchical object formation via the gravitational clustering in ",
    "the characteristic mass scales are discussed in  [ s32 ] .",
    "the epochs for the formation of objects are discussed in  [ s33 ] .",
    "we conclude with remarks in  [ s4 ] .",
    "the basic assumption for the following equations is that the density field is isotropic and homogeneous ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ,  10 , 27 , and 41 ) .",
    "we use comoving coordinates @xmath11 , i.e. , physical coordinates divided by the scale factor . the scale factor",
    "@xmath12 is normalized to @xmath13 at the present time @xmath14 .",
    "the mass density @xmath15 and its spatial average @xmath16 define the density contrast @xmath17 as @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 denotes an average .",
    "the relation to the fourier transform @xmath20 is @xmath21 for the wavenumber @xmath22 , the power spectrum @xmath23 is @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the complex conjugate of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is dirac s delta function .",
    "so far as in the linear regime where the linear theory is valid , the density contrast and power spectrum grow in a self - similar manner : @xmath28 the linear growth factor @xmath29 is @xmath30 with the hubble parameter @xmath31 together with equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , the continuity equation @xmath32 yields the peculiar velocity @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the time derivative of the linear growth factor @xmath29 . the factor @xmath35 implies that the peculiar velocity is dominated by larger scales than the density contrast .",
    "this property of the peculiar velocity is essential to our discussion in  [ s3 ] .",
    "the two - point correlation of the density contrast @xmath36 at the scale @xmath37 is computed from the power spectrum : @xmath38 for the pairwise peculiar velocity , i.e. , the relative velocity that is parallel to the separation vector @xmath39 , the two - point correlation @xmath40 is @xmath41 p_{\\rm lin}(k ) dk\\ ] ] ( monin & yaglom 1975 ,  12 ; grski 1988 ) . here",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are first - kind spherical bessel functions @xmath44 we defined the two - point correlations in terms of the linear growth factor @xmath29 because we use them only in the linear regime .",
    "consider a mass element that occupies the position @xmath11@xmath45 at the initial time @xmath46 .",
    "this initial or lagrangian position @xmath11@xmath45 is related to the position @xmath47 at the time @xmath48 as @xmath49 according to the za ( zeldovich 1970 ; see also shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) .",
    "the initial velocity @xmath50 is determined on the eulerian linear theory ( eq . [ [ eq6 ] ] ) .    even when the eulerian linear theory becomes invalid ,",
    "the za is valid ( e.g. , yoshisato , matsubara , & morikawa 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , as in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , the za describes the motion of mass elements in gravitational clustering .",
    "the za becomes invalid when the trajectories of mass elements starting from different positions intersect one another .",
    "the za mass elements pass away without any interaction , which occurs in practice and leads to formation of a gravitationally bound object ( gurbatov , saichev , & shandarin 1989 ; shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) .",
    "we thereby define the object formation as this trajectory intersection .",
    "since the trajectory intersection proceeds from small to large scales ( e.g. , yoshisato , morikawa , & mouri 2003 ) , the object formation proceeds from low to high masses in accordance with the current paradigm (  [ s1 ] ) .",
    "the usual definition for the object formation is that the density contrast @xmath17 reaches approximately unity in the eulerian linear theory ( e.g. , press & schechter 1974 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ; bond et al .",
    "this is consistent with our definition because the true density contrast is very large in both the cases .",
    "the smoothing is based on a gaussian window function , which is localized in the real and wavenumber spaces and is convenient .",
    "if the smoothing scale is @xmath51 , we equivalently use the new power spectrum @xmath52 the relation between the smoothing scale @xmath51 and the mass @xmath53 of the corresponding class of objects depends on the objects themselves ( bardeen et al . 1986 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ) . since we are to assume that the objects have collapsed , we approximate as @xmath54 this approximation is in accordance with the definition of characteristic mass scales in  [ s32 ] ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq24 ] ] ) .",
    "the mass @xmath53 includes both baryonic and dark matters .",
    "when we are interested in a class of objects with a mass @xmath53 , the initial peculiar - velocity field @xmath55 is smoothed over the scale @xmath51 .",
    "the smoothed field determines the motion of those objects via the za ( mann , heavens , & peacock 1993 ) . although the za is invalid over scales where objects have been formed , it is valid over the larger scales",
    ". they are in the linear or so - called quasi - linear regime .",
    "the za on a smoothed field , i.e. , the truncated za , is actually known as a better approximation than the za on the original field ( e.g. , coles , melott , & shandarin 1993 ; melott , pellman , & shandarin 1994 ) .",
    "the smoothing over a scale @xmath51 and the subsequent application of the za imply that we consider not the initial time but a time when objects with the mass @xmath53 have been formed .",
    "a larger smoothing scale corresponds to a later time because the object formation proceeds from low to high masses (  [ s1 ] ) .",
    "the smoothing is also necessary to obtain statistics such as the root - mean - square density contrast (  [ s31 ] ) . without the smoothing , in the cold dark matter model",
    ", there are significant small - scale fluctuations that cause divergence of those statistics ( peebles 1980 ,  26 and 96 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "the density contrast and peculiar velocity at the initial time are not only isotropic and homogeneous but also random gaussian .",
    "their statistics are uniquely determined by the initial power spectrum @xmath56 the transfer function @xmath57 is from the cold dark matter model of bardeen et al .",

    "the normalization constant @xmath63 is set to be @xmath64 on the basis of the root - mean - square mass contrast within the radius @xmath65mpc observed for the present time , 0.9 ( spergel et al . 2003 ; see also peebles 1980 , ",

    "this is just the probability that the maximum of @xmath78 exceeds the value @xmath79 .",
    "we differentiate @xmath80 to obtain @xmath81 as the probability that the maximum takes the value @xmath79 .",
    "our discussion is limited to one - dimensional cuts of the three - dimensional peculiar - velocity and density fields .",
    "only for such a one - dimensional signal , useful statistical measures exist (  [ s25 ] and [ s32 ] ) .",
    "they have been nevertheless used in three - dimensional turbulence for decades ( e.g. , monin & yaglom 1975 ,  12 and 15 ) and are hence expected to yield crude but still useful information on three - dimensional process of the object formation .",

    "they are normalized with their root - mean - square values .",
    "the peculiar velocity @xmath85 is in the direction of the one - dimensional cut .",
    "the peculiar velocity and density contrast were obtained from the three - dimensional fourier transforms .",
    "their real and imaginary parts are mutually independent and random gaussian .",
    "we assigned the fourier transforms according to the initial power spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq2 ] ] ) and converted them to the real - space counterparts ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq1 ] ] and [ [ eq6 ] ] ) .",
    "the density field has many peaks .",
    "they individually collapse into gravitationally bound objects .",
    "the peculiar - velocity field has larger - scale variations (  [ s21 ] ) .",
    "then , as predicted by the za and indicated by arrows , the density peaks cluster together .",
    "they form a new class of more massive objects , provided that the clustering velocity is high enough .",
    "zeros of the peculiar velocity , i.e. , stationary points of the clustering motion , are centers or edges of the clustering .",
    "there the density contrast is positively or negatively enhanced in a significant manner .",
    "we also see small - scale velocity variations , which correspond to collapse and merger of the individual density peaks during the clustering .    while the mean size of density peaks is equal to the mean interval @xmath86 between successive extrema of the density contrast , the mean size of overdense regions is equal to the mean interval @xmath87 between successive zeros of the density contrast .",
    "the mean clustering scale is equal to the mean interval between successive ridges and troughs of the peculiar velocity , where the clustering motion is largest .",
    "this interval is equal to the mean interval @xmath88 between successive zeros of the peculiar velocity .",
    "together with the typical clustering velocity , the mean clustering scale @xmath88 determines the typical clustering timescale .",
    "using equation ( [ eq8 ] ) and its derivatives at @xmath89 , the length scales @xmath90 and @xmath91 in equations ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) are obtained for the pairwise peculiar velocity at the initial time @xmath46 smoothed over the scale @xmath51 : @xmath92 ^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] and @xmath93 ^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] likewise , using equation ( [ eq7 ] ) and its derivatives at @xmath89 , the length scales @xmath94 and @xmath95 are obtained for the initial density contrast : @xmath96 ^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] and @xmath97 ^{1/2 } , \\ ] ] the scales @xmath91 and @xmath94 are identical apart from a numerical factor .",
    "for the initial density contrast , we also obtain the correlation length @xmath98 , i.e. , the length scale characteristic of the large - scale correlation ( e.g. , monin & yaglom 1975 ,  12 ) @xmath99 the correlation length is zero for the initial pairwise peculiar velocity because its two - point correlation is significantly negative at large scales ( see below ) .",
    "although @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath98 are defined at the initial time , they are valid throughout the linear regime where the peculiar velocity and density contrast remain random gaussian .",
