    "genetic algorithms ( gas ) are emerging as a useful tool in the theoretical prediction of crystal structures ( see ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) @xcite . during a ga calculation",
    "it is possible that the system will _ stagnate_. when stagnation occurs , one or more local minima dominate the search and the method is unable to find the global minimum solution . in this communication",
    "we improve the convergence to the global minimum solution of the castep ",
    "ga @xcite through the use of a fitness function which is able to differentiate structures during the course of a ga minimization .",
    "binary  encoded gas such as the method of @xcite are able to directly compare the binary strings that make up their population members and determine if two populations members are the same . in this way it is possible to remove any highly prevalent local minimum from the population , and prevent its creation in future mating operations .",
    "while this method is not possible in the frame  work of the castep ",
    "ga , we have developed an alternative approach that significantly reduces the stagnation rate and also forces the system to explore new minima .",
    "this alternative approach is also broadly transferable to a wide range of other gas .",
    "our ga method @xcite is a real  space encoded technique for crystal structure prediction which takes advantage of the periodicity of the simulation supercell to improve the speed and accuracy of convergence to the global minimum free - energy crystal structure .",
    "there is a _ population _ of structures ( or _ members _ ) which are bred together to produce new members , such that with each subsequent _ generation _ the population evolves in an attempt to determine the global minimum structure .",
    "the _ fitness function _ of the ga is used to determine how good ( `` fit '' ) a structure is and this is then used to weight the probability of survival of that structure and its probability to produce offspring .",
    "while this method has been very successful in the past , we wanted to reduce the stagnation rate and thereby improve the quality of the solutions produced during a ga structure search . since this is a real  space based approach it is not possible to directly compare the atomic co  ordinates of two population members to determine if they are the same structure . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "the enthalpy of the structure was used to calculate the fitness . in this work ,",
    "we propose augmenting this fitness function with an additional function which is able to determine the similarity of two structures .",
    "we shall illustrate the effectiveness of this new approach by first studying the lennard  jones crystals for comparison with our previous results and then the high pressure phases of the dzugutov potential @xcite .",
    "the enthalpy  based fitness function is @xmath0 } { 2}\\ ] ] with the variable @xmath1 being defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the enthalpy of the highest enthalpy member of the population , @xmath4 is the enthalpy of the lowest enthalpy member and @xmath5 is the enthalpy of the member @xmath6 being considered .",
    "the fitness of each member @xmath6 is @xmath7 and this is a function which varies between zero and one .",
    "population members with a fitness close to zero are less `` fit '' , and members with a fitness close to one are more `` fit '' .",
    "population members are then selected ( using roulette  wheel selection ) for reproduction or are removed from the population based on this fitness value .",
    "this should mean that only fit members are selected to remain in the population , or are allowed to breed ( _ crossover _ ) .",
    "it is often very likely that during the course of a calculation multiple copies of population members are made . in a bit  string",
    "represented ga duplicate members are very easy to spot but in a real  space encoded ga it is very hard to tell if two members are the same during the course of a calculation , since the crystal structure may be orientated or translated in any way within the simulation cell ( due to use of periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "this is even harder if the simulation cell parameters are also allowed to vary during the course of a calculation .",
    "hence we need a simple measure of structural similarity so that we can detect when duplicate structures exist within a population .",
    "whilst this is encouraging from the point of view of ultimate structural convergence , in the early stages of the ga minimization we want to ensure as much structural diversity as possible to enable a broad search of possible solutions and so we want to penalise similar structures .    since we are using this routine to differentiate between like and unlike structures , rather than any form of comprehensive structural analysis , we can simplify this comparison somewhat .",
    "if we are performing a calculation in which we allow the number of atoms to vary , then we can make an educated guess that two structures with different numbers of atoms are different ( or rather in this case any offspring produced in the crossover procedure will have a greater number of degrees of freedom to explore the potential energy surface ) , so we will have no need to compare these structures .",
    "we also do not need to compare each structure with all other structures , since we are merely trying to prevent stagnation rather than give a definitive structural comparison , and so we can simply compare all structures with the minimum enthalpy structure which has the same number of atoms as itself that exist in the current generation .",
    "we will define a comparison function between structures which returns zero if the structures are the same and one if the structures are suitably dissimilar .",
    "we also want to keep the fact that lower enthalpy structures are `` better '' than higher enthalpy ones , so we further weight the value that any given structure has by the value of @xmath7 of the fittest member in that `` set '' which is made up of members with the same number of atoms . here",
    "we define our improved fitness function as @xmath8 where the left ",
    "superscript @xmath9 above denotes comparing between groups with the same number of atoms only , @xmath7 is as defined in equation [ eq : fit1 ] , @xmath10 is a weighting value between zero and one and @xmath11 is a function which compares member @xmath6 of the set of atoms @xmath9 with the fittest member in that set ( as defined by equation [ eq : fit1 ] ) .",
    "this means that the fitness of the fittest member of each group ( @xmath12 ) will be unchanged from its enthalpy value , and all other values in the group will be scaled accordingly . if the value of the fitness weight , @xmath10 , is set to @xmath13 then the maximum value of @xmath14 that any member could have",
    "is the same value of the fittest member of the group , @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath10 is set to zero then this function reduces to that given in equation [ eq : fit1 ] .",
    "the comparison function @xmath11 is    @xmath15    where consideration of the spherically averaged scattering intensity leads to @xmath16 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is positive  definite ( and is based on the debye scattering formula @xcite ) . in equation [ eq : comp2 ] , there are @xmath17 ions within the simulation cell which has a volume @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the scattering factor of ion @xmath20 which has the atomic real  space co  ordinate of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a bessel function .",
    "the function @xmath23 of a population member @xmath6 of each group @xmath9 is tested against the function @xmath24 of the fittest member in the group @xmath9 containing the same number of atoms as member @xmath6 .",
    "equation [ eq : comp1 ] is then used to compare these two functions and returns a single number between zero and one . in a variable  supercell calculation",
    "it is possible for this function to become greater than one when the structures are highly dissimilar , in which case we set the value of @xmath11 to one .",
    "the results presented here will use two different empirical potentials , the lennard ",
    "jones potential @xcite and the dzugutov potential @xcite which is defined as@xmath25 where    @xmath26    with the constants defined in table [ tab : dz ] .",
    "a comparison of these two potentials is shown in figure [ fig : ljdz ] .",
    "the dzugutov potential was originally formulated to simulate liquid systems , however it has also been shown to have some interesting solid phases @xcite , and can also be used to form quasi ",
    "crystals @xcite .",
    ".table of parameters used in the dzugutov potential ( equation [ eq : dz ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     data taken from @xcite .    where the term `` lower enthalpy '' refers to having lower enthalpy than the phase in column 2 .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tab : dz_runsum ] a number of ga minimizations found structures with a lower enthalpy than the previously reported minimum enthalpy structure .",
    "in total three distinct new structures were found .",
    "a plot showing the progress of a ga minimization down to the new lowest  enthalpy structure found is shown in figure [ fig : dz62_stra ] with the structure itself shown in figure [ fig : dz62_strb ] .",
    "a plot comparing the radial distribution functions of all the known and unknown phases of the dzugutov potential is shown in figure [ fig : dz_rad ] , as well as the hcp phase .",
    "the three new phases found are all significantly different from the established phases of this potential . examination of these phases suggests that the simulation cells correspond to primitive cells and not supercells , but attempts to further characterize these structures by space group have so far been unsuccessful .",
    "the atomic co  ordinates of these structures are available online@xcite as supplementary material .",
    "a plot showing the energy  volume curves for the six phases of the dzugutov potential found in the course of this study is shown in figure [ fig : dz_evcurve ] .",
    "phase `` @xmath27 '' is the most stable phase at all positive pressures .",
    "in this paper we have developed a novel fitness function that combines a traditional approach to fitness based upon enthalpy , with a simple structural comparison factor to find new , more stable crystal structures within a ga for crystal structure prediction .",
    "this method penalises the presence of similar structures within the population which prevents the ga stagnating in some local minimum .",
    "the ga method itself was also extended to allow both the simulation supercell and the number of atoms within that supercell to vary .",
    "the number of atoms must only be varied within fixed limits to prevent the system size becoming too large or too small .",
    "studies using the lennard ",
    "jones potential showed the calculation progressing through the fcc local minimum and two other stacking  fault local minima before finding the hcp global minimum enthalpy structure .",
    "this was shown to be repeatable and efficient .",
    "when this new ga was used to study phases of the dzugutov potential at different pressures all the previously reported zero  temperature phases were found , along with three new phases , one of which is the most stable phase at all positive pressures .",
    "these new structures are markedly different from the three previously  known phases .",
    "this clearly illustrates the power of this ga to find new crystal structures that were hitherto unexpected .",
    "calculations were performed on our departmental beowulf cluster , epsrc grant r47769 from the multi - project research equipment initiative .",
