    "in the past decade , there is an explosion of research interest in the study of complex adaptive system ( cas ) .",
    "in fact , examples of cas are ubiquitous in our complex and complicated world .",
    "ecosystems , nervous system , banking industry , organism and economic systems like stock markets are all examples of cas . the study of cas allowed us to investigate how rich , complicated pattern structure or behavior emerged from collection of relatively simple components .",
    "so , what are the essential features of a complex adaptive system ? according to levin @xcite , cas must have three essential elements : ( i )  sustained diversity and individuality of components , ( ii )  localized interactions among those components and ( iii )  an autonomous process that selects from among those components , based on the results of local interactions , a subset for replication or enhancement .    in the framework of cas , econophysicists study the collective behavior of economic system by building up simple model using statistical mechanical and nonlinear physical methods .",
    "in particular , minority game ( mg ) @xcite is a simple model of economic system composed of adaptive and inductive reasoning agents , which successfully captures the minority seeking behavior in a free market economy .",
    "this game was proposed by challet and zhang under the inspiration of the el farol bar problem introduced by the theoretical economist arthur @xcite .",
    "mg is a toy model of @xmath3 inductive reasoning players who have to choose one out of two alternatives independently in each turn by their current best working strategies or mental model . those who end up in the minority side ( that is , the choice with the least number of players ) win .",
    "although its rules are remarkably simple , mg shows a surprisingly rich self - organized collective behavior @xcite . to explain the dynamics of mg , hart _ et al .",
    "_ introduced the so - called crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite .",
    "their theory stated that fluctuations arisen in the mg is controlled by the interplay between crowds of like - minded agents and their perfectly anti - correlated partners .",
    "numerical simulation as well as the crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite showed that the global behavior of mg depends on three parameters : ( i )  the number of players @xmath3 , ( ii )  the number of strategies @xmath4 each player has and ( iii )  the number of the most recent minority sides @xmath5 that a strategy depends on .",
    "global cooperation , as indicated by the fact that average number of players winning the game each time is larger than that where all players make their choice randomly , is observed whenever @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "is it true that global behavior of mg is determined once @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fixed ?",
    "specifically , we ask if it is possible to lock the system in a global cooperative phase for any fixed values of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we can do so by studying the multichoice minority game  a variant of the mg in which players have @xmath0 choices . in our previous work ,",
    "we have answered the above question by building up a multichoice minority game model called mg(@xmath1,@xmath7 ) where @xmath1 is the number of player s choice @xcite . in mg(@xmath1,@xmath7 ) , all strategies are picked from a reduced strategy space consisting of @xmath7 mutually anti - correlated and uncorrelated strategies only .",

    ", it was found that the dynamics of the mg is dominated by a period-@xmath10 dynamics whenever @xmath11 , i.  e.  in the overcrowding phase @xcite . in this phase , the strategy space size is much smaller than the number of strategies at play and thus each strategy is used by a large number of players .",
    "it is such an overcrowding effect which leads to the period-@xmath10 dynamics in this phase . however ,",
    "will the periodic dynamics also appear in the overcrowding phase of a multichoice minority game ?    in this paper , we would like to continue our previous study by investigating the global cooperation of players in the multichoice minority game model known as mg(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) .",

    "thus the total number of possible evolutionary path in the effective history space also increases exponentially with @xmath106 and the periodic dynamics become less pronounced when @xmath106 increases .",
    "nevertheless , we found that @xmath69 exhibits peculiar behavior in mg(@xmath1,@xmath7 ) with @xmath111 .",
    "in particular , @xmath69 shows a period-@xmath46 multi - peak structure whenever the prediction vector of each history is uniquely determined by @xmath112 for any integer @xmath113 $ ] . for mg(@xmath1,@xmath8 ) , the strategy space is @xmath114-dimensional since the strategy space is spanned by @xmath114 independent strategies ( see eqn .",
    "( [ e : ss])-([e : cond_uncorr ] ) ) .",
    "thus the strategy space is 2-dimensional in mg(@xmath1,@xmath7 ) which give rise to the abnormal properties of @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , there are only 2 choices for @xmath111 which is remarkably different from those games with more than two choices .",
    "it is because if a strategy does not choose room-0 , then it must choose room-1 and vice - versa for a 2-choice game .",
    "we believe the above two factors lead to the marked difference of the dynamics of the system in mg(@xmath1,@xmath7 ) with @xmath111 compared to other mg(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) games with @xmath0 .    in summary",
    ", we found that the periodic dynamics only exists in the overcrowding phase for particular reduced strategy spaces in the mg(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) game .",
    "in contrast , the periodic dynamics always appears in the overcrowding phase for the original mg where all player s strategies are drawn from the full strategy space .",
    "in conclusion , we have successfully build up the mg(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) model whenever @xmath1 is a prime power .",
    "it is a generalized mg model where each players has @xmath12 choices and all strategies are drawn from the reduced strategy space that is consisted of uncorrelated and anti - correlated strategies only .",
    "although our mg(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) model is not exactly same as the mg , its global cooperative behavior is similar to that of the mg no matter what @xmath4 , @xmath13 and @xmath5 are .",
    "however , the dynamics of mg(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) model is remarkably different from that of the mg . for the mg(@xmath1,@xmath2 ) , the periodic dynamics only exists in the overcrowding phase for particular reduced strategy spaces ; on the contrary , the periodic dynamics always appears in the overcrowding phase for the mg .",
    "indeed , we have only given explanation of the periodic dynamics in the mg(@xmath1,@xmath8 ) model for some of the reduced strategy spaces in which a periodic dynamics exists .",
    "thus it is instructive for us to find reasonable explanation for the periodic dynamics in other cases .",
