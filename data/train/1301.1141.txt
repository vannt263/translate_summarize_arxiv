    "chiral effective field theory ( eft ) as proposed in the pioneering works of weinberg @xcite is a powerful tool for the derivation of nuclear forces . in this scheme",
    "there is an underlying power counting which allows to improve calculations systematically by going to higher orders in a perturbative expansion .",
    "in addition , it is possible to derive two- and corresponding three - nucleon forces as well as external current operators in a consistent way . over the last decade or",
    "so it has been demonstrated that the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) interaction can be described to a high precision within the chiral eft approach @xcite . following the original suggestion of weinberg , in these works the power counting",
    "is applied to the @xmath3 potential rather than to the reaction amplitude .",
    "the latter is then obtained from solving a regularized lippmann - schwinger equation for the derived interaction potential .",
    "the @xmath3 potential contains pion - exchanges and a series of contact interactions with an increasing number of derivatives to parameterize the shorter ranged part of the @xmath3 force . for reviews we refer the reader to refs .",

    "the extension of our study @xcite to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is in progress @xcite and a first glimpse on the ( still preliminary ) achieved results for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 interactions will be given .",
    "then i report results of a study on the strangeness @xmath6 sector , i.e. for the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and cascade - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) interactions .",
    "predictions obtained at leading order ( lo ) @xcite are reviewed and implications for the @xmath2-dibaryon are discussed , based on our framework , in the light of recent lattice qcd calculations where evidence for the existence of such a state was found .    at lo in the power counting , as considered in the aforementioned investigations @xcite , the baryon - baryon potentials involving strange baryons consist of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges , analogous to the @xmath3 potential of @xcite .",

    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges while at nlo contact terms with two derivatives arise , together with contributions from ( irreducible ) two - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "the spin- and momentum structure of the potentials resulting from the contact terms to lo is given by @xmath13 in the notation of @xcite where the @xmath14 s are so - called low - energy coefficients ( lecs ) that need to be determined by a fit to data .",

    "there are further ( four ) lecs that contribute only to the @xmath6 system .",
    "the spin - space part of the one - pseudoscalar - meson - exchange potential is similar to the static one - pion - exchange potential ( recoil and relativistic corrections give higher order contributions ) and follows from the @xmath15 invariant pseudoscalar - meson  baryon interaction lagrangian with the appropriate symmetries as discussed in @xcite : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the mass of the exchanged pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath31 at the various baryon - baryon - meson vertices are fixed by the imposed @xmath10 constraints and tabulated , e.g. , in @xcite . they can be expressed in terms of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 mev ) and @xmath35 , the so - called @xmath36-ratio , for which we adopted the @xmath37 value ( @xmath38 ) . note that we use the physical masses of the exchanged pseudoscalar mesons .",

    "one particular interesting aspect of the coupled @xmath65 system is the @xmath2-dibaryon , a deeply bound 6-quark state with @xmath79 predicted by jaffe from the bag model @xcite , that should occur in this channel .",

    "variations of the meson masses enter only in the potential in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , those of the baryon masses ( via @xmath44 ) in the ls equation  ( [ ls ] ) .",
    "let me first consider individual variations of the masses of the involved particles . to begin with",
    "i examine the dependence of the @xmath2 binding energy on the pion mass @xmath81 and keep all other ( meson and baryon ) masses at their physical value .",
    "corresponding results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] ( left ) . adjusting the lec so that a @xmath2 binding energy of 13.2 mev is predicted for @xmath82 mev , corresponding to the result published by nplqcd  @xcite , yields the dashed curve .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to a @xmath2-dibaryon that is bound by 1.87 mev at the physical point , i.e. with the same binding wave number ( 0.23161 @xmath83 ) as the deuteron in the @xmath3 case . enlarging the pion mass to around 400 mev for the latter scenario ( i.e. to values in an order that corresponds to the nplqcd calculation @xcite ) increases the binding energy to around 8 mev and a further change of @xmath81 to 700 mev ( corresponding roughly to the hal qcd calculation @xcite ) yields then 13 mev .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath81 obtained agrees  at least on a qualitative level  with that presented in ref .",
    "specifically , our calculation exhibits the same trend ( a decrease of the binding energy with decreasing pion mass ) and our binding energy of 9 mev at the physical pion mass is within the error bars of the results given in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we clearly observe a non - linear dependence of the binding energy on the pion mass . as a consequence , scaling our results to the binding energy reported by the hal qcd collaboration @xcite ( 30 - 40 mev for @xmath84  mev ) yields binding energies of more than 20  mev at the physical point , which is certainly outside of the range suggested in ref .",
    "however , it has to be said that for such large pion masses the lo chiral eft can not be trusted quantitatively .",
    "now let me look at the dependence of the @xmath2 binding energy on the masses of the involved baryons .",
    "in case of the @xmath2-dibaryon one is dealing with three coupled channels , namely @xmath74 , @xmath9 , and @xmath12 .",
    "since we know from our experience with coupled - channel problems @xcite that coupling effects are sizeable and the actual separation of the various thresholds plays a crucial role , we expect a considerable dependence of the @xmath2 binding energy on the thresholds ( i.e. on the @xmath85 , and on the @xmath86 and @xmath87 masses ) .",
    "corresponding results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] in the right panel .",
    "note that the pion mass and the masses of the other pseudo - scalar mesons are kept at their physical value while varying the @xmath88 thresholds .",
    "for the isospin - averaged masses used in the actual calculation the thresholds are at 2231.2 , 2257.7 , and 2385.0  mev , respectively .",
    "thus , the physical difference between the @xmath74 and @xmath9 thresholds is around 26  mev while the @xmath89 threshold is separated from the one for @xmath74 by roughly 154 mev .",
    "first i discuss the effect of the @xmath89 channel because its threshold is quite far from the one of @xmath74 so that there is a rather drastic breaking of the su(3 ) symmetry . indeed , when the @xmath85 mass is decreased so that the nominal @xmath89 threshold ( at 2385  mev ) moves downwards and finally coincides with the one of the @xmath74 channel ( 2231.2  mev ) , a concurrent fairly drastic increase in the @xmath2 binding energy is observed , cf . the solid curve in fig .  [ fig : mpi ] for results based on the interaction with a binding energy of 1.87  mev for physical masses of the mesons and baryons .",
    "in this context i want to point out that the direct interaction in the @xmath8 channel is actually repulsive for the low - energy coefficients fixed from the @xmath16 data plus the pseudoscalar meson exchange contributions with coupling constants determined from the su(3 ) relations @xcite , and it remains repulsive even for lec values that produce a bound @xmath2-dibaryon .",
    "but the coupling between the channels generates a sizeable effective attraction which increases when the channel thresholds come closer .",
    "the dashed curve is a calculation with the contact term fixed to simulate the binding energy ( @xmath90  mev ) of the nplqcd collaboration at @xmath91mev .",
    "as one can see , the dependence of the binding energy on the @xmath85 mass is rather similar .",
    "the curve is simply shifted downwards by around 4.5  mev , i.e. by the difference in the binding energy observed already at the physical masses .",
    "the asterisks and crosses represent results where , besides the variation of the @xmath8 threshold , the @xmath9 threshold is shifted to coincide with that of the @xmath74 channel .",
    "this produces an additional increase of the @xmath2 binding energy by 20  mev at the physical @xmath8 threshold and by 9  mev for that case where all three @xmath88 threshold coincide .",
    "altogether there is an increase in the binding energy of roughly 60  mev when going from the physical point to the case of baryons with identical masses , i.e. to the su(3 ) symmetric situation .",
    "this is significantly larger than the variations due to the pion mass considered before .    after these exemplary studies let me now try to connect with the published @xmath2 binding energies from the lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the results obtained by the hal qcd collaboration are obviously for the su(3 ) symmetric case and the corresponding masses are given in table i of ref .",
    "thus , one can take those masses and then fix the additional lec so that their @xmath2 binding energy is reproduced with those masses . to be concrete :",
    "the masses @xmath92mev and @xmath93mev are used , and the lec is fixed so that @xmath94mev . when now the masses of the baryons and mesons are changed towards their physical values the bound state moves up to the @xmath74 threshold , crosses the threshold , crosses also",
    "the @xmath9 threshold and then disappears .",
    "in fact , qualitatively this outcome can be already read off from the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] by combining the effects from the variations in the pion and the baryon masses .",
    "based on those results one expects a shift of the @xmath2 binding energy in the order of 60 to 70  mev for the mass parameters of the hal qcd calculation .    in case of the nplqcd calculation the values provided in ref .",
    "@xcite are taken .",
    "those yield then 17  mev for the @xmath9-@xmath74 threshold separation ( to be compared with the physical value of roughly 26  mev ) and 77  mev for the @xmath12-@xmath74 separation ( physical value around 154  mev ) .",
    "we also use the meson masses of ref .",
    "@xcite , specifically @xmath95 mev . with those baryon and meson masses",
    "again the lec is fixed so that the @xmath2 binding energy given by the nplqcd collaboration is reproduced , namely @xmath96  mev @xcite .",
    "again the masses of the baryons and mesons are changed so that they approach their physical values .",
    "also here the bound state moves up to and crosses the @xmath74 threshold .",
    "however , in the nplqcd case the state survives and remains below the @xmath9 threshold at the physical point .",
    "specifically , an unstable bound state @xcite is observed in the @xmath9 system around 5  mev below its threshold and a corresponding resonance at a kinetic energy of 21  mev in the @xmath74 system    phase shifts for the @xmath74 and @xmath9 channels are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] , for the relevant partial wave ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the solid line is the result for the @xmath88 interaction that produces a loosely bound @xmath2-dibaryon with @xmath97  mev .",
    "the phase shift for the @xmath9 channel , fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( b ) , is rather similar to the one for the @xmath57 @xmath3 partial wave where the deuteron is found , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "specifically , it starts at @xmath98 , decreases smoothly and eventually approaches zero ( for large energies not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the result for @xmath74 , fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( a ) , behaves rather differently .",
    "the pertinent phase commences at zero degrees , is first negative but becomes positive within 20  mev and finally turns to zero again for large energies .",
    "this behaviour of the phase shifts was interpreted in @xcite as a signature for that the bound @xmath2-dibaryon is actually predominantly a ( bound ) @xmath9 state .",
    "indeed , in that work it was argued that it follows already from the assumed ( approximate ) su(3 ) symmetry of the interaction , that any @xmath2-dibaryon is very likely a bound @xmath9 state rather than a @xmath74 state .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the interaction that was fitted to the result of the hal qcd collaboration and reproduces their bound @xmath2-dibaryon with their meson and baryon masses .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] are those obtained with physical masses of the mesons and baryons .",
    "the phase shift of the @xmath9 channel shows no trace of a bound state anymore .",
    "still the phase shift rises up to around @xmath99 near threshold , a behavior quite similar to that of the @xmath69 @xmath3 partial wave where there is a virtual state ( also called antibound state @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , such a virtual state also seems to be present in the @xmath9 channel as a remnant of the original bound state .",
    "the effect of this virtual state can be seen in the @xmath74 phase shift where it leads to an impressive cusp at the opening of the @xmath9 channel , cf . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( a ) .    the @xmath9 phase shift for the nplqcd scenario ( i.e. for the interaction that reproduces their bound @xmath2-dibaryon with their meson and baryon masses )",
    ", see the dash - dotted curve , starts at @xmath98 , a clear indication for the presence of a bound state .",
    "however , in this case the bound state is not located below the @xmath74 threshold but above , as already mentioned before .",
    "consequently , the corresponding @xmath74 phase shift exhibits a resonance - like behavior at the energy where the ( now quasi ) bound @xmath2-dibaryon is located .",
    "phase shifts for the @xmath69 @xmath12 partial wave can be found in ref .",
    "the predictions of the three considered cases for this channel are practically the same .",
    "chiral effective field theory , successfully applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath3 interaction , also works well for the baryon - baryon interactions in the strangeness @xmath0 ( @xmath100 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath101 ) sectors .",
    "as shown in our earlier work , already at leading order the bulk properties of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 systems can be reasonably well accounted for .",
    "the new results for the @xmath16 interaction presented here , obtained to next - to - leading order in the weinberg counting , look very promising .",
    "first there is a visible improvement in the quantitative reproduction of the available data on @xmath102 and @xmath103 scattering and , secondly , the dependence on the regularization scheme is strongly reduced as compared to the lo result .",
    "indeed the description of the @xmath16 system achieved at nlo is now on the same level of quality as the one by the most advanced meson - exchange @xmath16 interactions .    the recently reported evidence for the so - called @xmath2-dibaryon from lattice qcd calculations stimulated us to investigate also the quark - mass dependence of binding energies for baryon - baryon systems in the strangeness @xmath6 sector within the chiral eft framework .",
    "here i presented results of an analysis performed at leading order in the weinberg counting .",
    "we found rather drastic effects caused by the su(3 ) breaking related to the values of the three thresholds @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "for physical values the binding energy of the @xmath2 is reduced by as much as 60  mev as compared to a calculation based on degenerate ( i.e. su(3 ) symmetric ) @xmath88 thresholds . translating this observation to the lattice qcd results reported by the hal qcd collaboration @xcite , we see that the bound state has disappeared at the physical point . for the case of the nplqcd calculation @xcite , a resonance in the @xmath7 system might survive .",

    "<S> results from an ongoing study of baryon - baryon systems with strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 within chiral effective field theory are reported . </S>",
    "<S> the investigations are based on the scheme proposed by weinberg which has been applied rather successfully to the nucleon - nucleon interaction in the past . </S>",
    "<S> results for the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions obtained to leading order are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the issue of extrapolating the binding energy of the @xmath2-dibaryon , extracted from recent lattice qcd simulations , to the physical point is addressed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , first results for the hyperon - nucleon interaction at next - to - leading order are presented and discussed .    </S>",
