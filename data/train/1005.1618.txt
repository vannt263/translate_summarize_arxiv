    "recently , garaud & acevedo - arreguin ( 2009 ) ( gaa09 hereafter ) presented a preliminary analysis of a `` new '' mechanism for rotational mixing in stellar interiors and conjectured on its potential role in the depletion of lithium in young main sequence stars .",
    "this mechanism , called `` gyroscopic pumping '' , was originally studied in the context of earth s atmospheric dynamics by haynes et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and later discussed in the astrophysical context by gough & mcintyre ( 1998 ) and mcintyre ( 2007 ) who argued that it plays an important role in the dynamics of the solar interior . loosely speaking",
    ", gyroscopic pumping occurs in any rotating fluid in the presence of additional stresses or forces which perpetually accelerate or decelerate the flows in the azimuthal direction . by conservation of angular momentum , the accelerated parcels of fluid move away from the rotation axis while the decelerated ones move toward the rotation axis , thus generating meridional fluid motion .",
    "stars with outer convective regions often exhibit a significant amount of surface differential rotation ( e.g. collier - cameron 2007 ; reiners 2007 ) .",
    "this differential rotation is thought to be maintained by anisotropic and spatially varying reynolds stresses ( see rdiger 1989 , for example ) , which tend to continually accelerate the equatorial regions and decelerate the poles in a manner most remarkably observed in the solar convection zone ( schou et al .",
    "if one assumes that the star is close to dynamical equilibrium , its mean rotation rate @xmath1 lies in between the polar and equatorial rotation rates . when viewed in a frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath1 , the differential rotation of the star s convective zone forms a large - scale azimuthal flow pattern , typically prograde in the equatorial region and retrograde in the polar regions .",
    "the aforementioned `` gyroscopic pumping '' can then be viewed in two equivalent ways . as described earlier the constant acceleration of the equatorial regions",
    "is a local source of angular - momentum to the fluid , which by angular - momentum conservation must move outward from the rotation axis .",
    "similarly , fluid in the polar regions must move toward the rotation axis .",
    "alternatively , one may simply note that the coriolis force associated with the azimuthal flows described above pushes the fluid away from the rotation axis in prograde regions , and toward the rotation axis in retrograde regions .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : gyro ] , the process naturally drives large - scale meridional flows throughout the outer convection region , with an upwelling near the equator , a poleward velocity near the surface and downwelling near the poles .",
    "the polar downwelling does not need to stop at the radiative  convective interface , and could in principle cause significant non - local mixing between the outer convection zone and the regions below .",
    "a similar gyroscopic pumping process is likely to drive fluid motion from within an inner convective zone as well .",
    "while the internal rotation profile of stars with convective cores has never been observed , one can readily expect some degree of differential rotation since the turbulent stresses associated with the rotationally constrained convective motions are likely to act in a similar fashion to those of the outer convective region . in that case again , there is no a - priori reason for the flows thus generated to stop at the interface with the overlying radiative zone , and one may wonder how much mixing they induce in the star .      the first quantitative study of gyroscopic pumping in the context of stellar interiors was recently presented by gaa09 .",
    "they focused on the solar case , i.e. a star with an outer convective region and an inner radiative region , and worked in the boussinesq approximation ( arguing that the solar radiative zone does not span too many pressure and density scaleheights ) .",
    "they showed that the fate of gyroscopically pumped flows  how much overall mixing they induce beyond the convective zone  depends equally on the thermal stratification and on the dynamical properties of the nearby radiative region .    in accordance with the earlier results of garaud & brummell ( 2008 )",
    ", they found that in stratified , rotating stars in quasi - steady dynamical balance , the effect of stratification on large - scale meridional flows is principally controlled by the quantity @xmath2 where pr @xmath3 is the prandtl number ( where @xmath4 is the local viscosity , and @xmath5 is the local thermal diffusivity ) , @xmath6 is the local brunt - visl  or buoyancy  frequency and @xmath7 is the mean stellar rotation rate . when @xmath8 is large , the effect of thermal stratification is strongly felt by the gyroscopically pumped meridional flows , which are exponentially damped away from the radiative  convective interface on the lengthscale @xmath9 .",
    "correspondingly , if @xmath8 is small the flows can _ in principle _ penetrate much more deeply into the radiative interior , and cause significant large - scale mixing .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath8 depends on @xmath7 , so that the effect of stratification ( in the sense defined above ) is strongly reduced for rapidly rotating stars .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma ] shows an estimate of @xmath8 for various stars in the mass range @xmath10 at age 300myr . in all cases , @xmath8 remains well - below unity showing that large - scale mixing of the radiative zone by gyroscopic pumping could be significant for these stars .",
    "crucially , however , gaa09 showed that even in the very weakly stratified limit ( @xmath11 ) , a second condition needs to be satisfied for the pumped flows to penetrate into the nearby radiative region .",
    "indeed , this limit corresponds to the case where the system s dynamics are dominated by the balance between the perturbation to the pressure gradient and the coriolis force .",
    "this well - known situation is called the `` taylor - proudman '' state , and ( in the boussinesq approximation ) implies that all components of the velocity field are strongly constrained to be constant along the rotation axis .",
    "gaa09 showed that the taylor - proudman constraint can prohibit flow generated within the outer convection zone from entering the underlying radiative zone .",
    "indeed , by mass conservation , any flows entering the radiative zone must somehow return to the convection zone .",
    "but such return flow would necessarily require breaking away from the taylor - proudman state .",
    "hence , if there exists a region within the radiative zone where the taylor - proudman constraint is broken , then this region provides a channel through which the pumped flows can return , as illustrated in figure [ fig : gyro2 ] .",
    "if such a region does not exist , the meridional flows instead return within the convection zone causing negligible mixing in the radiative zone .",
    "since the taylor - proudman constraint is broken whenever there exist additional stresses of amplitude comparable with the coriolis force , various mechanisms can be invoked .",
    "of particular interest are maxwell stresses in the presence of small- or large - scale magnetic fields ( see gough & mcintyre 1998 , for example ) , and turbulent stresses within another convective region .",
    "it is the latter we are mostly interested in studying in this work , namely the case of stars with a convective envelope _ and _ a convective core .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present a fairly exhaustive study of gyroscopic pumping for rapidly rotating stars ( in the limit where @xmath12 ) . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] we lay out the general formulation of the problem and the assumptions made .",
    "note that the basic model used in this paper is largely inspired from the work of gaa09 but extends it to the case of multiple convective regions and uses a more generally applicable formalism for the fluid dynamics , namely the anelastic approximation . in ",
    "[ sec : cart ] we first solve the problem analytically in a cartesian coordinate system , using a much simplified stellar model .",
    "this exercise provides insight onto how the meridional flow velocities induced by gyroscopic pumping scale with the forcing mechanism ( in this case the differential rotation of the inner and/or outer convection zone ) , with the stratification within the radiative region , and with the system s geometry ( i.e. the respective widths of the inner and outer convective regions ) . in  [ sec : spher ] , we then apply the same model in a two - dimensional spherical geometry , using a more realistic stellar model as the background state . by comparing cartesian - model results with equivalent spherical - model results ,",
    "we deduce a very simple rule to go from one to the other .",
    "this rule is particularly useful since one - dimensional cartesian model numerical solutions can be obtained in a tiny fraction of the time necessary to integrate the two - dimensional spherical case , and can also be pushed to true stellar parameter values ( which can not be done in two dimensions ) .",
    "next , we present a simple application of this theory to estimate the surface abundances of lithium ( li ) and beryllium ( be ) in young main sequence stars as a function of their age and mass . more precisely , we are interested in young stars in the mass range of @xmath10 , which have the well - known property of being significantly depleted in li and be in their surface layers as compared with slightly more and slightly less massive stars ( boesgaard & tripico 1986 ; see boesgaard 2005 and anthony - twarog et al .",
    "2009 for reviews ) .",
    "these so - called `` li - dip '' stars are unique in the sense that they have two significant convection zones ( one inner and one outer ) which , as described earlier , could promote large - scale mixing between the surface and the interior by gyroscopic pumping . in ",
    "[ sec : lidip ] , we show that the li and be depletion rates as induced by gyroscopic pumping for li - dip stars can be very significant . for reasonable model assumptions , the cool ( low - mass ) side of the dip is readily explained by gyroscopic pumping , while depletion fractions on the hot ( high - mass ) side are much larger than observed .",
    "when the diffusion of chemical species back into the outer convection zone ( by overshooting motions for example ) is taken into account , good agreement between the model and the data is achieved on both sides of the dip .",
    "finally , we conclude in  [ sec : ccl ] by summarizing our main results and discussing future prospects .",
    "in this section we briefly derive the model equations used throughout this paper .",
    "we consider a star of radius @xmath13 , rotating with a mean angular velocity @xmath7 . in all that follows",
    ", we assume that the system is in a quasi - steady state , non - magnetic , and axially symmetric . while these assumptions are probably over - simplistic , they help us narrow down gyroscopic pumping to its essence .",
    "the star considered can have up to two convective regions : a convective core , extending from the center of the star to a first radiative  convective interface located at the radius @xmath14 ; and a convective envelope , located between the outer radiative  convective interface at @xmath15 and the surface .",
    "note that the stellar surface and both interfaces are assumed to be perfectly spherical .",
    "gaa09 studied large - scale meridional flows within the solar interior using the boussinesq approximation .",
    "this approximation treats the thermodynamical quantities as the sum of a weakly varying background plus small perturbations .",
    "one may argue in favor of its use in the solar radiative zone , which does not span too many density scaleheights . here , however , we aim to model stars with very thin outer convective regions , in which case the radiative zone extends nearly all the way to the stellar photosphere",
    ". we must therefore switch to using the more general anelastic approximation instead , which allows for a more strongly varying background stratification .",
    "the anelastic approximation implicitly assumes that all velocities are small compared with the local sound speed , and that thermodynamical perturbations are small compared with the equivalent background quantities .",
    "we thus define @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 as the spherically symmetric background pressure , density , temperature and entropy profiles , and the equivalent @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as two - dimensional perturbations to these quantities .",
    "if the equation of state is assumed to be that of a perfect gas ( which is an acceptable approximation for the purpose of this work ) , then the perturbations are related by @xmath24 neglecting for simplicity the dependence on the chemical gradients .",
    "the momentum , thermal energy and mass conservation equations describing the dynamics of the interior flows and thermodynamical perturbations , in the anelastic approximation , are : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the velocity field expressed in a frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath7 , @xmath27 is gravity , @xmath28 is the viscous stress tensor , @xmath29 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath30 is the thermal conductivity and finally @xmath31 is the turbulent heat flux ( in the convective regions ) . note that we have neglected any distortion of the star caused by the centrifugal force , as well as perturbations to the gravitational field .",
    "these assumptions suppress the well - known _ global _ eddington - sweet flows ( see spiegel & zahn 1992 ) .",
    "following gaa09 , we model the inertial term of the momentum equation in the convective regions by the sum of a turbulent viscosity plus a linear drag term driving the system toward a differentially rotating profile : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the assumed / observed azimuthal velocity profile in the convective zones and where @xmath34 is the local convective turnover timescale ( which varies with depth ) .",
    "this drag term is introduced to `` mimic '' the effect of turbulent convection on driving differential rotation .",
    "it is only significant in the convection zones , and drops to zero in the radiative region .",
    "the very slow flow velocities expected in the radiative zone justify neglecting the various nonlinear terms in the momentum and heat equation there .",
    "we replace the turbulent heat advection term by a turbulent diffusivity , which is assumed to be very large in the convection zones and rapidly tends to zero otherwise .    the resulting model equations , which we use throughout this work unless otherwise specified , are therefore : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is similar to the microscopic stress tensor , but using a turbulent viscosity instead .",
    "note that we have rewritten the background heat advection term to emphasize the dependence on the buoyancy frequency @xmath37 ( see spiegel & zahn 1992 , for example ) .",
    "much can be learned about the dynamics of stellar interiors by first studying a simplified problem in cartesian geometry ( the `` planar star '' approximation , see garaud & brummell 2008 and gaa09 for example ) .",
    "equations in this geometry can usually be solved analytically to gain insight into the physical processes at play .",
    "they often reveal important scaling laws governing the solutions , and finally , are rarely more than an `` order one '' geometrical factor away from more realistic solutions in spherical geometry ( in fact we prove this in  [ sec : spher ] )",
    ". our primary goals in this section are therefore not quantitative .",
    "rather , we aim to determine , qualitatively , how deeply the meridional flow velocities generated by gyroscopic pumping penetrate into the radiative zone , and characterize how their amplitude scales with the system parameters",
    ".    since the cartesian model solutions obtained are knowingly off by a factor of order unity anyway , we further simplify the equations , in this section only , with the following substitutions : @xmath38 it can be shown ( through numerical integrations ) that neither of these substitutions affect the scalings of the solutions in the case where both convection zones are present .",
    "finally , and following spiegel & zahn ( 1992 ) we neglect in this section , for analytical simplicity , the pressure perturbations in the linearized equation of state so that : @xmath39      as in gaa09 , we consider a cartesian coordinate system @xmath40 with @xmath41 aligned with both gravity and with the rotation axis .",
    "the @xmath42-direction represents the azimuthal direction , while the @xmath43-direction is equivalent to minus the co - latitude .",
    "distances are normalized to the stellar radius @xmath13 , so that the stellar interior is in the interval @xmath44 $ ] , the inner convection zone spans the interval @xmath45 $ ] and the outer convection zone spans @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] illustrates the geometry of the cartesian system .",
    "we assume that the star is axially symmetric , i.e. independent of @xmath42 , and periodic in @xmath43 on the interval @xmath47 $ ] ( representing the two `` poles '' ) with equatorial symmetry ( i.e. symmetric about @xmath48 ) .",
    "the background stellar model is chosen to be very simple , so that analytical solutions of the problem can easily be found .",
    "we take    * @xmath49 and @xmath50 , * @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constant .",
    "note that fits to actual stellar models show that the non - dimensional density and temperature scaleheights typically satisfy the inequalities @xmath54 .",
    "the global velocity field in the rotating frame is @xmath55 and flow velocities are normalized to @xmath56 . in this framework ,",
    "the unit timescale is @xmath57 .",
    "density and temperature perturbations are normalized by @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , where @xmath60 is the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity .",
    "pressure perturbations are normalized to @xmath61 .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : gov_eqs ] ) then simplifies to the non - dimensional system : @xmath62 where we have introduced a series of standard parameters , namely the ekman number @xmath63 and the equivalently defined @xmath64 , as well as @xmath65 which is actually an inverse peclet number , and the equivalently defined @xmath66 .",
    "note that the microscopic diffusivities normally vary with depth within a star , but are assumed here to be constant for simplicity .",
    "deep within the interiors of hyades - age stars in the li - dip mass range , @xmath67    in order to fully specify the model , the functions @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and the turbulent diffusivity profiles must be selected .",
    "the buoyancy frequency is taken to be @xmath71\\mbox {   ,   } \\ ] ] so that @xmath72 in both convection zones , and @xmath73 in the radiative zone .",
    "the lengthscales @xmath74 and @xmath75 may be thought of as the respective thicknesses of the `` overshoot '' regions located near each of the two convection zones ( and in this section are taken to be equal to one another , for simplicity ) . for @xmath69 ,",
    "we take @xmath76 + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm out}}{2 } \\left[1 +   \\tanh\\left(\\frac{z - z_{\\rm out}}{\\delta_{\\rm out}}\\right ) \\right ] \\mbox {    ,   } \\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are assumed to be constant and equal to the inverse of the ( non - dimensional ) convective turnover time in the relevant convection zone .",
    "both convective zones may be differentially rotating . for mathematical simplicity again , we assume in this cartesian model that their latitudinal dependence is similar",
    ". we therefore select the following functional form for @xmath70 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 to guarantee equatorial symmetry .",
    "the radial profile @xmath81 is then chosen to be @xmath82 + \\frac{\\hat u_{\\rm cz}^{\\rm in}(z)}{2 }",

    "\\label{eq : uczprof}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 can a priori depend on depth ( see gaa09 for example ) . by analogy ,",
    "the non - dimensional turbulent diffusivity profiles are constructed as @xmath85 + \\frac{e^{\\rm in}_{\\nu,{\\rm turb}}(z)}{2 }",
    "\\left[1 + \\tanh\\left(\\frac{z_{\\rm in}-z}{\\delta_{\\rm in}}\\right)\\right]\\mbox {    ,   } \\label{eq : eturbs}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath86 .",
    "projecting the model equations into cartesian coordinates , using invariance in the @xmath87direction and seeking periodic solutions in the form of @xmath88 for each of the dependent variables yields : @xmath89 where the subscript @xmath41 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we need to specify an adequate set of boundary conditions for the system .",
    "the two boundaries at @xmath90 and @xmath91 are assumed to be impermeable ( @xmath92 ) , stress - free ( @xmath93 ) , and the temperature perturbations are assumed to be zero .",
    "note that as long as the system boundaries are located in a convective region , the actual choice of boundary conditions has little influence on the result .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : maineqs ] ) and associated boundary conditions ( see above ) can be solved analytically when the overshoot regions are very thin compared with the depths of the respective convective zones .",
    "the complete derivation of the solution is fairly straightforward although algebraically cumbersome .",
    "it is detailed in appendix a : exact solutions are derived in each of the three regions @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath94 $ ] and @xmath46 $ ] , and matched to one another across the radiative  convective interfaces at @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively . in",
    "what follows , we discuss the most important outcome of this analysis , namely the prediction of the gyroscopically pumped mass flux mixing the radiative zone .      as found by gaa09 , in the limit where @xmath12 the meridional flows generated in the convective regions can penetrate deeply into the nearby radiative zone .",
    "a very simple way of seeing this is to note that in this limit , the @xmath87component of the momentum equation in ( [ eq : maineqs ] ) reduces to @xmath97 in the radiative zone which then implies , by mass conservation , that @xmath98 hence the non - dimensional vertical mass flux mixing the radiative zone , @xmath99 , is constant along the rotation axis : @xmath100 and spans the entire region , extending from one convection zone to the other as drawn in figure [ fig : gyro2 ] for example .",
    "the details of the calculation of the pumped mass flux @xmath101 , even for this simplified stellar model , are fairly complicated and are presented in appendix a. in the limit where the depths of both convection zones @xmath102 and @xmath103 are small compared with the stellar radius ( which is true for most stars in the li dip ) , we show that @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the `` pumping term '' @xmath106 and where @xmath107 is the following fairly obscure factor : @xmath108   \\left [ \\frac{e^k}{\\sinh(k ) }   \\left ( 1 + \\frac{d_{\\rm out}}{l } \\right ) - \\frac{e^{-(z_{\\rm out}-z_{\\rm in})/l}}{\\sinh(k ) } \\left(1 - \\frac{d_{\\rm in}}{l } \\right )    - \\frac{1}{kl } \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & kl^4 \\left [   1 + \\frac{2l}{d_{\\rm in } } - \\frac{2l}{z_{\\rm in } }   e^{z_{\\rm in}/l } \\right ]   \\left [   \\frac{e^{(z_{\\rm out}-z_{\\rm in})/l } } { \\sinh(k ) } \\left ( 1 + \\frac{d_{\\rm out}}{l } \\right ) - \\frac{e^{-k}}{\\sinh(k ) } \\left(1 - \\frac{d_{\\rm in}}{l } \\right )   -    \\frac{1}{kl } \\right ] \\mbox { , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 note that @xmath107 is found to be negative for all reasonable parameter values , so that the denominator of ( [ eq : wrzconst ] ) never vanishes . our analytical solution is easily verified by comparison with numerical solutions of the full set of equations ( [ eq : maineqs ] ) , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : comparecart ] .",
    "however , let us first attempt to understand the meaning of ( [ eq : wrzconst ] ) on physical grounds .",

    "] : @xmath113 we see that @xmath101 is roughly of the order of the pumping term , times a factor which depends only on the respective properties ( depth , convective turnover time ) of the convective zones .",
    "our main conclusion is that the mass flux into the radiative zone appears to go to zero or @xmath114 ) then the analysis presented in appendix a is no longer valid .",
    "it can be shown instead ( analytically and numerically ) that the meridional flow amplitudes do not entirely drop to zero but instead drop to the level of ekman ( viscous ) flows and depend sensitively on the boundary conditions . meanwhile , if @xmath115 _ or _",
    "@xmath116 , but the turbulent stresses @xmath117 and @xmath118 are non - zero , then mixing of the radiative zone by the pumped flows can still be effective . indeed , gyroscopic pumping from one of the two convective zones is still effective , and the second provides the return pathway for the flows .",
    "this effect is not expressed in ( [ eq : wrzconst ] ) , since our analytical derivation ignores for simplicity the effect of the turbulent diffusion term compared with the relaxation term .",
    "] if one of the convection zones vanishes , either by becoming vanishingly thin ( @xmath119 or @xmath120 ) , or if the associated convective stresses become negligible ( @xmath77 or @xmath121 ) .",
    "this important result can in fact be easily understood in the light of the work of gaa09 described in  [ sec : intromix ] . indeed , in the unstratified case",
    ", radiative zone flows must satisfy the taylor - proudman constraint .",
    "any flows generated by gyroscopic pumping in one convection zone can only enter the radiative zone if there is a return path at the other end . if the second convective zone vanishes , this return path is no longer available .",
    "the flows instead return within the existing convection zone , and do not mix the radiative region significantly .",
    "the stratified case with @xmath12 is very similar .",
    "based on these very simple considerations , we can therefore expect that the overall mixing rate in the star resulting from gyroscopic pumping must reach a maximum for a given stellar mass between @xmath122 ( no or negligible convective core ) and @xmath123 ( no or negligible convective envelope ) .",

    "in the limit where the first term is much larger than the second then @xmath125 the flow velocities pumped into the radiative zone are now found to follow a local eddington - sweet scaling law , which is not surprising since we are looking at quasi - steady flows in a stratified fluid driven by rotational forcing .",
    "such solutions were already found by spiegel & zahn ( 1992 ) for example in the case of the sun .",
    "naturally , local eddington - sweet flows are much slower than the flows pumped through each individual convective zone , although they could still provide significant sources of mixing in fairly rapidly rotating stars .    the effect discussed in the unstratified case ,",
    "namely the complete suppression of @xmath101 in the limit where one of the convection zone disappears , still occurs but only when @xmath126 since @xmath127 is typically very large because @xmath128 is very small , this limit is only relevant for _ extremely _ thin or weak convective regions .",
    "based on these considerations , we can now re - interpret ( [ eq : wrzconst ] ) in the following way : @xmath101 has two strict upper limits : a first upper limit , which arises from mechanical constraints ( by the driving force and the taylor - proudman constraint ) , and a second upper limit which arises from the thermal stratification of the system ( which can strongly suppress radial flows ) .",
    "the actual value of @xmath101 mixing the radiative zone is the smaller of the two , thus defining two different regimes , the `` unstratified '' regime ( where @xmath101 is mechanically constrained ) and the `` weakly stratified '' regime ( where @xmath101 is thermally constrained ) .      in this section",

    "the flow velocities in this `` weakly stratified '' regime scale as @xmath149 , which is equivalent to the aforementioned local eddington - sweet scaling since @xmath150 and pr are constant . note that in this regime , the flow pattern still spans the entire region with constant @xmath99 .      to summarize this section ,",
    "we have used a simple toy model to study how gyroscopic pumping by convective zone stresses induces large - scale meridional fluid motions .",
    "we found that the pumping indeed drives significant large - scale flows within the convection zone(s ) ( see gaa09 ) .",
    "furthermore , in some circumstances , a fraction of the pumped mass flux may enter the adjacent radiative zone , and induce a circulation of material with the following properties :    * convection zone flows penetrating into the nearby radiative zone are exponentially damped on a lengthscale @xmath151 where @xmath8 is given by equation ( [ eq : sigmadef ] ) . if @xmath12 ( which is the case for most rapid rotators ) the flows can _ potentially _ mix the entire star ( garaud & brummell 2008 , gaa09 ) . * in the limit @xmath12 the pumped mass flux _ within the radiative zone _",
    "@xmath99 is mechanically constrained to be constant along the rotation axis . *",
    "the fraction of the gyroscopically pumped mass flux which does enter the radiative zone ( by contrast with the mass flux which returns immediately within the driving convection zone ) is capped by the lowest of two constraints : a mechanical constraint , which crucially depends on the presence of another source of stresses somewhere else within the system to enable flows to return to their point of origin ( see previous sections for detail , as well as gaa09 ) , and a thermal constraint , which limits the flow velocities to local eddington - sweet velocities .",
    "note that this second constraint was not discussed by gaa09 , but turns out to be the most relevant one for most stars .",
    "the efficiency of gyroscopic pumping on mixing stellar interiors thus depends on many factors , including the background stellar structure , the thermal diffusivity , the stellar rotation rate and the nature of the convective zone stresses .",

    "the second goal is much more quantitative , and is to extract ( if possible ) simple laws relating the calculated mass flux @xmath101 in the cartesian case to its equivalent in the spherical case .",
    "since cartesian solutions are much easier to calculate than spherical geometry solutions , a simple rule to go from one set of solutions to the other could prove particularly useful later .",

    "schramm et al . ( 1990 ) suggest that the temperature range of the lithium dip also corresponds to that of the pulsational instability strip where it intersects the main sequence , so that a slow mass loss rate , induced by low - amplitude pulsations , could simply remove the lithium remaining in the surface layers .",
    "michaud ( 1986 ; see also richer & michaud 1993 ) explained the dip by diffusion and gravitational settling of li atoms out the bottom of the convection zone",

    ". this process can circulate li out of the surface convection zone down to layers where it can be destroyed , but no entirely satisfactory model has yet been found .",
    "such mixing can be induced by gravity waves generated by the surface convection zone ( garcia lopez & spruit 1991 , talon & charbonnel 2003 ) or by meridional circulation or secular shear instabilities ( deliyannis & pinsonneault 1997 ) . in the rotational mixing models the cool side of the dip is explained by the increase in rotational velocity as @xmath234 increases , possibly combined with the gravity wave model .",
    "the hot side is much more difficult to explain ; talon & charbonnel ( 1998 ) propose a model involving wind - driven meridional circulation and turbulent transport induced by differential rotation , based on earlier work by zahn ( 1992 ) and talon & zahn ( 1997 ) .",

    "we first convert this value back into dimensional form , and then to the spherical case using ( [ eq : cart2spher ] ) to obtain an estimate for @xmath265 , the local mass flux flowing in the tangent cylinder .",

    "the results , using @xmath265 estimated above and the true stellar density profiles , are shown in figure [ fig : timescales ] , together with the equivalent timescale for the transport of be from the be - burning radius @xmath246 to the outer convection zone . in all stars considered",
    ", the transport timescales are of the order of 30 - 100 myr and 100 - 300 myr for li and be respectively when the differential rotation rate @xmath170 is one percent .",
    "note that the transport timescale is not equal to the depletion timescale , although the two are related ( see appendix b for detail ) .",
    "figure [ fig : timescales ] also shows the similarly calculated timescale required for material to move from the convective core to the convective envelope .",
    "it is interesting and reassuring to note that for reasonable values of @xmath170 , this timescale is of the order of tens of gyr , so that one would not expect to see a strong modification of the surface abundances of he or cno nuclei over the lifetime of these stars .",
    "this is an important self - consistency check of the model .",
    "we now evaluate the rate of change of the mass fraction of li in the outer convective zone , denoted as @xmath268 . by definition @xmath269 , the ratio of the total mass of li in the outer convection zone to the total mass of the outer convection zone .",
    "since material flows through @xmath266 on its way up and down , we also need to define the mass fraction of li in @xmath266 , @xmath270 , i.e. the total mass of li contained in @xmath266 divided by the mass of that region .",
    "note that @xmath271 and can easily be integrated numerically .    based on figure [ fig : gyrofinal ] ,",
    "we see that @xmath272 since the total mass flux both up and down , within the tangent cylinder , is equal to @xmath273 . dividing the first equation by @xmath274 and the second by @xmath275 , we finally get @xmath276 which implicitly defines two timescales , @xmath277 the timescale @xmath278 is the characteristic timescale over which the material within the outer convection zone is recirculated by gyroscopic pumping , while @xmath279 is the timescale over which the material within the cylinder @xmath266 is recirculated . if @xmath280 then @xmath281 at all times . meanwhile ,",
    "if @xmath278 is of the order of or greater than @xmath279 , then @xmath282 can differ from @xmath283 significantly .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : mlidot1 ] ) can easily be solved analytically given the initial condition @xmath284 , the initial li abundance in the star .",
    "the calculation is detailed in appendix b. a very similar calculation can be done to estimate the surface be abundance @xmath285 as a function of time .",
    "the only difference is that one should replace @xmath245 with @xmath246 , the be - burning radius , which defines the slightly larger cylindrical region @xmath286 , and equivalently the quantity @xmath287 .",
    "the timescale @xmath278 remains the same , while we define @xmath288 our theoretical results , now expressed as li and be depletion fractions , are shown in figure [ fig : libenodiff ] , assuming values of @xmath289 , @xmath290 , and @xmath291 .",
    "they are compared with observed li and be abundances in the hyades as reported by boesgaard ( 2005 ) .",
    "it is quite clear that contrary to our naive expectation of  [ sec : cart ] , the gyroscopic pumping of li and be out of the outer convection zone does not decrease for the higher - mass stars despite the fact that their outer convection zone becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "this is also clear from figure [ fig : wrzs ] , where @xmath292 continues to increase with stellar mass instead of being quenched as initially expected . in the next sections ,",
    "we discuss why this is the case , and how to reconcile the model with observations .",
    "the most important conclusion from this analysis is that gyroscopic pumping alone may be able to explain the cool side of the dip for reasonable values of the differential rotation rate ( one merely needs to adjust @xmath170 ) , but always vastly over - estimates the depletion rate for stars on the hot side of the dip .",
    "since the gyroscopic pumping mechanism is quite generic , and arises from simple first - principles of angular momentum conservation our study then raises the question of how one might _",
    "suppress _ the effects of pumping in the hot side of the dip . in order to address the problem ,",
    "it is important first to understand the cause of the sharp decrease in the predicted depletion timescale for high - mass stars in this model .",
    "first , note that most of the pumping in the stars considered comes from the inner core .",
    "indeed , the density in the outer convection zone is so low that the mass flux @xmath293 generated in the outer convection zone is negligible compared with the mass flux generated from the inner convection zone ( see equation ( [ eq : wrzconst ] ) ) . as a result ,",
    "the characteristics of the inner core dominate the _ forcing _ of the flows , while the outer convection zone merely plays the role of providing a pathway for the flows to return to the interior .",
    "this is easily verified numerically by setting ( artificially ) @xmath116 to suppress the forcing in the outer convection zone .",
    "since turbulent viscosity in the outer convection zone is nevertheless still present , the return path still exists and as seen in figure [ fig : libestudy ] , the resulting depletion rates are hardly changed .",
    "one may then wonder what the main factor controlling the variation in the depletion rate as a function of stellar mass actually is .",
    "a few immediate possibilities come to mind .",
    "the convective velocities in the inner core of these stars , as well as the size of the inner core ( see table 1 ) , both increase with @xmath294 , implying that the total mass flux pumped by the inner convection zone is larger for stars on the hot side of the dip .",
    "in addition , the increase in the rotation rates of the stars as @xmath294 increases implies that the allowed flow speeds through the radiative zone are larger on the hot side of the dip ( see equation ( [ eq : esflows ] ) ) .",
    "all of these effects explain the trend seen in figure [ fig : wrzs ] , which clearly shows that the pumped mass flux @xmath292 increases with @xmath294 across the dip .    however , this is not sufficient to explain the vast increase in the depletion rates observed in figure [ fig : libenodiff ] as @xmath294 increases . in figure",
    "[ fig : libestudy ] we show different artificial models to illustrate this statement . model m1 is the aforementioned case where @xmath78 is set to zero .",
    "model m2 is created holding @xmath7 constant and equal to @xmath140rad / s across all stars in the model , to suppress the effect of increased rotation rate across the dip .",
    "model m3 is created holding @xmath77 constant and equal to 10 across all stars in the model , to suppress the effect of increased convective velocities across the dip .",
    "model m4 is created holding @xmath161 constant and equal to 0.05@xmath13 across all stars in the model , to suppress the effect of increased core size across the dip . in all cases ,",
    "all other quantities are the same as the original model of figure [ fig : libenodiff ] .",
    "as we can see , none of these changes affect the predicted depletion rates much .",
    "this incidentally also shows that the exact details of the model are not particularly important , and that another , much more fundamental effect controls the overall depletion rate .",
    "finally , we show ( as the two dotted lines ) a variant of model m2 in which @xmath7 is held constant but this time equal to @xmath295rad / s . this value is closer to the typical angular velocity ( derived from @xmath296 ) of stars for which",
    "li has actually been observed , which is significantly smaller than the median rotation rates for stars of the same mass ( see boesgaard 1987 ) .",
    "very similar depletion rates to those of models m1-m4 can be recovered provided the overall differential rotation is chosen to be larger ( @xmath297 ) .",
    "this shows that there is some degeneracy in the model parameters , which is not entirely surprising .",
    "the dominant effect in the model depletion trend is in fact found to be the decrease in the mass of the regions which need to be depleted in li or be as @xmath294 increases .",
    "this mass has two contributions : the mass of the outer convective zone @xmath298 , plus the mass contained in the cylinders @xmath266 and @xmath286 respectively . to illustrate the effect in question , we create two additional artificial models . in model",
    "m5 the mass of the outer convective zone is artificially held constant ( and equal to @xmath299 ) . in model m6 the mass in the cylinders",
    "is set to 0 ( assuming that only the li and be fractions in the convective zone need to be recirculated ) .",
    "the results are also shown in figure [ fig : libestudy ] .",
    "the depletion rates in each case are now strikingly different from those of models m1 - 4 . in the case of m5 ,",
    "the depletion fraction is now much more constant across all stars .",
    "this strongly suggests that the depletion timescale in figure [ fig : libenodiff ] varies with stellar mass more because the total mass which needs to be depleted varies than because the pumped mass flux @xmath292 varies .",
    "model m6 illustrates a fundamental property of these rapidly rotating li - dip stars undergoing gyroscopic pumping .",
    "since the pumped mass flux is independent of depth below the convection zone , unless the mass of be to be depleted is different from the mass of li to be depleted , the predicted depletion timescales will be exactly the same for the two species .",
    "this is precisely the case illustrated by model m6 which ignores the contribution of the cylinders @xmath266 and @xmath286 , so the predicted depletion fractions of li and be are exactly the same .",
    "hence , the mixed inner cylinders are crucial to the difference in the depletion timescales of li and be .",
    "moreover , their radii and heights uniquely determine the predicted ratio of the li and be depletion fraction .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : libenodiff ] , the original model described in  [ sec : lipred1 ] appears to predict the correct ratio , even though the absolute depletion fractions are too large for the hot side of the dip .",
    "the remaining question is why the pumping is not suppressed for stars of masses higher than 1.5@xmath0 , as originally expected from the gradual disappearance of the outer convective zone .",
    "in fact , it turns out that @xmath190 and @xmath244 remain significant in these stars , even though the total mass of the convection zone becomes negligible . since the main role of the outer convection zone is to provide a pathway to recirculate the small mass flux pumped by the inner core , there is no notable suppression of the pumping in this mass range contrary to our original idea described in  [ sec : cart ] .",
    "while the model as it stands appears to reproduce the depletion trend on the cool side of the dip with reasonable assumptions for the differential rotation of the inner core ( @xmath300 ) , it vastly overestimates the depletion fraction on the hot side of the dip .",
    "our efforts now shift to the problem of reconciling the model with observations , or in other words on _ reducing _ the depletion rate on the hot side of the dip .",
    "the answer , as it happens , is quite simple , and lies in the balance between advection of li - rich ( and be - rich ) material out of the outer convection zone by gyroscopic pumping , and diffusion of these elements back into it from the radiative zone below which , as illustrated in figure [ fig : gyrofinal ] , still has primordial li and be abundances . to take this new effect into account , equation ( [ eq : mlicz1 ] )",
    "must be modified as @xmath301 where the new third term is the mass flux of li diffused back into the outer convection zone .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath302 is presumably the sum of a microscopic and a turbulent contribution from convective overshoot .",
    "the microscopic contribution is evaluated using the prescription of gough ( 2007 ) , while the turbulent contribution presumably decays exponentially with depth below the convection zone on a typical overshoot depth lengthscale , yielding @xmath303 the equation for the evolution of @xmath304 remains unchanged ( neglecting the diffusion of li through the sides of the cylinder for simplicity ) .",
    "unfortunately , the addition of a diffusive component to the li flux now prevents us from deriving simple analytical solutions of these equations analogous to the ones found in  [ sec : lipred1 ] .",
    "instead , solutions can only be obtained numerically by integrating the partial differential equation ( [ eq : mlidot2 ] ) with time , and following the evolution of the spatially varying li profile .",
    "given the other approximations made throughout this work ( e.g. assuming that the rotation rate of the star , the background stellar structure and the convective forcing are all constant with time ) , and since our aim is merely a preliminary `` proof - of - concept '' , it seems futile to try to obtain a precise numerical solution of ( [ eq : mlidot2 ] ) .    instead ,",
    "in this first paper we proceed by approximating the gradient term to cast ( [ eq : mlidot2 ] ) in the form of an ordinary differential equation similar to ( [ eq : mlidot1 ] ) .",
    "this can be done simply be writing @xmath305 where we have assumed that there is a `` reservoir '' of material with primordial li abundance in the radiative zone in the form of a spherical shell of width @xmath306 adjacent to @xmath162 , and that li has to diffuse across that reservoir to be mixed into the convection zone . for this reservoir to contain enough li to replenish the convection zone",
    "it must have roughly the same mass , so we set @xmath307 where @xmath308 is a free parameter of the problem of order unity . finally , the diffusion coefficient must also be approximated by a constant for ( [ eq : mlidot2 ] ) to become a true ode . since the turbulent transport is weakest furthest from the radiative ",
    "convective interface , this is the `` bottleneck '' region for the diffusion of li back into the convection zone .",
    "hence we take @xmath309    as before , we divide ( [ eq : mlidot2 ] ) by @xmath274 to get @xmath310 where @xmath311 as shown in appendix b , one can integrate these equations analytically fairly straightforwardly .",
    "we find , as expected on physical grounds , that when the li diffusion timescale into the convection zone becomes shorter than the advection timescale out of the convection zone , the surface li abundance remains close to the primordial value .",
    "the resulting depletion fractions calculated using this method , for li and be , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : libewithdiff ] for a simple grid of parameters ( @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath315 ) , with the stellar models otherwise exactly the same as the ones used to create figure [ fig : libenodiff ] .",
    "note how , for all chosen parameter values , the li and be profiles now exhibit a clear dip centered roughly around the position of the observed li - dip . on the cool side",
    "the effects of diffusion are negligible and the predicted depletion rates are very similar to the ones obtained in the absence of diffusion ( see figure [ fig : libenodiff ] ) . on the hot side , diffusion is important and continuously replenishes the outer convection zone with li - rich and be - rich material .",
    "the transition between the cool and hot sides , in the model , occurs when the diffusion timescale of li back into the convection zone , namely @xmath316 , becomes comparable with the advection timescale of li - rich material out of it ( namely @xmath317 ) , and depends both on the diffusion rate ( as controlled by @xmath308 for example ) and on the pumping rate ( as controlled by @xmath170 ) .",
    "note that for the larger value of @xmath170 , the ratio of the li depletion fraction to the be depletion fraction within the dip remains close to 1 , contrary to observations . instead , the ratio of the predicted depletion fractions is closer to observations for lower values of @xmath170 .",
    "the overall `` best fit '' is found for @xmath312 and @xmath314 , which are not unreasonable parameter values .",
    "however , with our very crude model of the diffusion , we are not able to fit the exact position and amplitude of _ both _ li and be dips simultaneously . since we were only aiming for a proof - of - concept , we view the results obtained as quite satisfactory , although a more careful model will be required in the future should one wish to explain the structure of both dips in more detail .      to summarize this section ,",
    "we have found that the combination of gyroscopic pumping _ and _ turbulent diffusion of chemical species by overshooting motions ubiquitously predicts the presence of a dip in both li and be surface abundances for young ms stars in the mass range @xmath318 ( li - dip stars ) .",
    "depletion profiles close to the observed ones can be reproduced for reasonable values of model parameters .",
    "the increase in the depletion fraction on the cool side of the dip is explained by gyroscopic pumping and the progressively smaller amount of material which needs to be recirculated , while the decrease in the depletion fraction on the hot side of the dip is explained by the effect of diffusion on replenishing the outer convection zone with li and be .",
    "in this paper we performed an exhaustive study of a non - local source of rotational mixing called `` gyroscopic pumping '' , which was originally studied in the context of the earth s atmosphere by haynes et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and later discussed in the case of the sun by gough & mcintyre ( 1998 ) , mcintyre ( 2007 ) , and gaa09 .    in this mechanism ,",
    "large - scale meridional motions are driven by angular - momentum conservation whenever fluid undergoes forces in the azimuthal direction ( see  [ sec : intromix ] and in particular figure [ fig : gyro ] for detail ) .",
    "this is exactly the case in stellar convective zones , where rotationally influenced convection gives rise to the so - called @xmath319effect ( cf .",
    "rdiger 1989 ; see also garaud et al .",
    "2010 ) , and typically leads to the azimuthal acceleration of equatorial regions and deceleration of the poles .",
    "the resulting large - scale meridional circulation has fluid flowing outward from the rotation axis near the equator , and toward the rotation axis near the pole .",
    "note that this mechanism is quite generic , since it is simply based on angular momentum conservation .",
    "however , by contrast with other well - studied significant sources of rotational mixing , it does not rely on stellar spin - down to be effective  it is an inherently quasi - steady mechanism .",
    "as first shown by gaa09 and studied more extensively here , whether the fluid gyroscopically pumped in the convective zone ends up mixing the nearby radiative zone or not depends on many factors .",
    "the case of stars with a single convection zone , in the absence of any other mechanism , was first studied by gaa09 . in this case",
    "the overall amplitude of the flows penetrating into the radiative zone is limited to slow ekman flows , which are unlikely to play any significant role in mixing the stellar interior .",
    "however , this conclusion could be different if a large - scale magnetic field is present ( gough & mcintyre 1998 ) , as it is for instance thought to be the case in the sun .",
    "we defer the magnetic case to a subsequent paper .    here",
    "we focused on stars with two convection zones , in the absence of magnetic fields ( we accept that this approximation is probably over - simplistic ) .",
    "we found that gyroscopic pumping provides a significant source of non - local mixing in the radiative zones of these stars , more precisely along the rotation axis , within the cylinder tangent to the inner core ( see figure [ fig : gyrofinal ] ) .",
    "this mixing readily explains , for example , the cool side of the well - known li - dip and , when moderated by the effects of diffusion , provides predictions for the li- and be - depletion fractions which give a surprisingly good fit to the data on both sides of the dip ( see figure [ fig : libewithdiff ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that contrary to previous models , turbulent mixing here is needed not to explain li destruction but to explain the replenishment of the surface layers in li .",
    "of course , the various other effects described in  [ sec : liintro ] , which were not taken into account here , could also affect the li and be abundances : mixing by gravity waves , large - scale rotational mixing induced by stellar spin - down , radiative acceleration , etc .",
    "a more sophisticated study of the li - dip in the light of gyroscopic pumping , taking these effects into account as well as stellar evolution , is deferred to a subsequent publication .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that the gyroscopic pumping mechanism probably plays a role in the global redistribution of angular momentum within the star .",
    "whether this is related to the dichotomy between slow rotators and fast rotators on either side of the dip is an interesting question , which we hope to address in the future .",
    "gyroscopic pumping , as studied here , also opens up other interesting observational prospects beyond li - dip stars .",
    "for example , another important evolutionary phase when stars have two convective zones is the core helium burning phase on the red giant branch .",
    "our study shows that this pumping mechanism could provide an important connection between the convective envelope and the core , and perhaps help reconciliate some of the long - standing discrepancies in surface abundances of cno elements between models and observations .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the pumping itself has a tendency to drive a strong azimuthal shear in the system , close to the tangent cylinder ( see figure [ fig : sample ] ) .",
    "this shear could perhaps become unstable for very rapidly rotating stars , leading to much more violent mixing in the radiative zone .",
    "alternatively , this shear layer could also become the seat of an @xmath320effect and generate strong toroidal fields around the tangent cylinder .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on what kind of field such a flow structure would sustain , and what observable feature it may lead to  although a full answer to that question will require a study of gyroscopic pumping in the presence of magnetic fields .",
