    "the light nuclei have long provided a test bench for our understanding of nuclear structure . from an experimental point of view , this is the only region for which nuclei lying beyond the neutron dripline are presently accessible .",
    "theoretically , models incorporating explicitly the continuum are being developed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the structure of unbound systems , such as @xmath0li , is a key ingredient of three - body descriptions of two - neutron halo , such as @xmath2li , and related nuclei @xcite .    the lightest @xmath6 isotones , where the neutron 1@xmath7 state from the 1@xmath80@xmath9-shell is found to intrude into the @xmath10-shell states , are of particular interest .",
    "this phenomenom has long be known in @xmath2be @xcite and there is now , as cited below , good evidence that this inversion occurs in @xmath0li . in the case of @xmath11he , experiment suggests that low - lying s - wave strength occurs , although there is not agreement as to its strength @xcite . in the following",
    "we describe briefly a new experimental investigation of the low - lying level structure of @xmath0li and @xmath11he .",
    "one of the techniques well suited to the study of nuclei far from stability is that of nucleon removal or breakup of a high - energy radioactive nuclear beam .",
    "the few - nucleon breakup of such beams can be employed to populate , and study through the fragment@xmath12neutron final - state interaction ( fsi ) , unbound nuclei .",
    "in addition to benefiting from significant cross sections ( typically @xmath1310@xmath12100  mb ) , the high energies result in the strong forward focussing of the reaction products ( increasing the effective detection acceptances ) and permit the use of thick targets ( @xmath13100  mg/@xmath14 ) .",
    "consequently measurements with beam intensities as low as @xmath13100  pps are feasible . here",
    "we report on measurements using secondary beams of @xmath2be and @xmath3b to investigate the low - lying level structures of @xmath0li and @xmath1he .    the experiments employed 35  mev / nucleon beams delivered with intensities of some 10@xmath1510@xmath16  pps by the lise3 separator at ganil .",
    "the beam velocity charged fragments and neutrons emitted in the forward direction from the reactions on a carbon target were identified and the momenta determined using a si - si - csi array coupled to a large - scale neutron array .",
    "these measurements allowed the fragment+neutron ( _ f - n _ ) relative energy spectra to be reconstructed . in order to interpret the spectra , simulations , which were validated using the in - flight decay of well established resonances ( such as @xmath17he@xmath18 ) ,",
    "were developed to model the response function of the experimental setup .",
    "detailed accounts of the work presented here may be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "li+n and @xmath4he+n systems for the different reactions indicated .",
    "the dotted lines represent the uncorrelated background distribution obtained by event - mixing .",
    "the thin solid lines are the virtual @xmath5states , while the dashed lines are the resonances .",
    "the thicker solid line is the overall adjustment.,width=508 ]",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath4he+n and @xmath1li+n systems are shown in figures [ fig : dub2 ] and [ fig : anne ] . as demonstrated in our work on the c(@xmath19c,@xmath20b+n )",
    "single - proton removal reaction @xcite , the description of the relative energy spectra require , in addition to discrete final states , a broad and rather featureless continuum of uncorrelated events which may be generated via event mixing @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the origin of these events may be attributed to scattering on the target of the ( weakly bound ) valence neutron , fragment recoil effects @xcite and the population of very broad overlapping states . in the case of breakup involving both proton and neutron removal from the projectile ( such as the @xmath3b reactions here ) , the detection of neutrons arising from the decay of more neutron - rich systems will also contribute .",
    "both the spectra obtained for the @xmath1li+n channel ( figures [ fig : dub2](a ) , [ fig : dub2](b ) and [ fig : anne ] ) , as well as that for @xmath4he+n derived from two - proton removal from @xmath2be ( figure [ fig : dub2](c ) ) , exhibit significant strength just above threshold , which can be most satisfactorily described by the presence of a virtual s - wave scattering state .",
    "the results for the c(@xmath2be,@xmath1li+n ) and c(@xmath2be,@xmath4he+n ) reactions are in line with what may be expected on the basis of simple considerations , whereby proton only removal from the projectile should leave the neutron configuration undisturbed @xcite .",
    "given the dominant @xmath5wave neutron component in @xmath2be@xmath18 , proton removal to @xmath0li and @xmath1he should populate preferentially @xmath5wave final states . in the case of @xmath1li+n , a scattering length ( @xmath21 ) around -14  fm",
    "was deduced , whereas that for @xmath4he+n is close to 0  fm ( @xmath21=  -3    0  fm at the 3-sigma level ) , signifying a very weak fragment - neutron interaction .",
    "the @xmath0li result is in line with other studies , including high - energy neutron removal from @xmath2li @xcite , whilst that for @xmath1he , despite being in some conflict with very similar work @xcite to that presented herebe,@xmath4he+n ) reaction at 25  mev / nucleon deduced a stronger fsi , corresponding to a scattering length @xmath21@xmath22 - 10  fm @xcite . ] , is in good accord with a very recent report of a study at relativistic energies employing @xmath2li breakup @xcite .",
    "li+n from breakup of a @xmath20b beam .",
    "the dotted lines represent the uncorrelated background distribution obtained by event - mixing , whilst the thin solid lines are the virtual @xmath5state and resonance ( see text ) .",
    "the thicker solid line is the overall adjustment.,height=336 ]    the @xmath1li+n relative energy spectrum from the breakup of @xmath23b ( figure [ fig : dub2](b ) ) clearly displays the presence of a higher lying state some 0.5  mev above threshold , which may be identified with the expected @xmath24wave resonance observed in other studies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , breakup of @xmath20b exhibits an enhanced yield to this resonance relative to the @xmath5state , as displayed in figure [ fig : anne ] @xcite . despite suffering from limited statistics ,",
    "the @xmath4he+n relative energy spectrum obtained from breakup of @xmath23b ( figure [ fig : dub2](d ) ) is consistent with the presence of the weakly interacting @xmath5wave strength identified above in the two proton - removal from @xmath2be and a resonance around 1.2  mev above threshold .",
    "the latter is in line with the original observations made using pion double - charge exchange @xcite and heavy - ion multi - nucleon transfer and reactions @xcite .",
    "in summary , in the present work the @xmath25 character of the @xmath0li ground state and the existence of a resonance some 0.5  mev above threshold have been confirmed .",
    "in addition , evidence for low - lying @xmath8-wave strength in @xmath11he , corresponding to a rather weak fragment - neutron interaction , has been found .",
    "indications of a resonance some 1.2  mev above threshold have also been observed .",
    "more generally , the results obtained for @xmath0li populated via proton removal from the @xmath2be beam support the validity at intermediate energies of simple selection rule arguments @xcite  namely , the final - states produced in proton - removal reactions are dominated by those with the same character as the projectile neutron configuration .",
    "the very weakly bound nature of @xmath2be suggests that such considerations are valid even in the case of removal of a deeply bound proton from a projectile with a loosely bound valence neuton .",
    "finally , it was also seen that other final states may be populated in breakup involving proton and neutron removal . however , as discussed elsewhere , care must be taken in terms of the neutron decay of more neutron - rich systems leading to that of interest @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank their many colleagues in the lpc  charissa  demon collaboration and acknowledge the excellent support provided by the technical staff of lpc and ganil .",
