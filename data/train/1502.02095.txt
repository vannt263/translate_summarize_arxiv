[",
    "fig : partition]b for an example ) .",
    "the word bulk  emphasizes that the boundaries between a and b spread out the whole system , and the couplings between the boundary spin-1/2s are relevant . due to the gap of aklt model , the coupling strength between spin-1/2s decreases exponentially with their distance , hence only nearest neighboring interactions",

    "@xcite in general , the sdrg process in the initial stage depends strongly on the probability distribution of the random couplings , thus often drives the energy scale of interest to be exponentially small than the strongest bond in the bare hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , this is not the case here because of the uncorrelated locations of the segment ends ( which we impose ) and the finite correlation length in the topological phase .    for the distribution of segment length ( hence the coupling strength ) , the most natural recipe is to specify a fixed average length of the segments and to assume that the segment ends are located independently .",
    "if we suppose that the average length of the segment is large , one can show that the probability distribution of the segment length @xmath20 ( assumed to be continuous for simplicity ) satisfies the following differential equation @xmath35where the constant @xmath36 is the average length of the segments .",
    "we can further assume that the segments have a minimum length of @xmath37 , such that @xmath38the discreteness of the segment length is not important when the average segment length is sufficiently long .",
    "as often emerged in the minimum mathematical model of the life expectancy problem , the exponential form of the probability distribution simply means that the occurrence of the next segment end is independent of the location of the previous one .    as we discussed above , the energy scale that couples two adjacent segment end spin-1/2s depends on the length of the segment .",

    ", one can imagine that a spin-1/2 singlet bond is formed within each segment , leaving an extra pair of spin-1/2s at the two ends to be coupled with the end spins in other segments , as the result of the bipartition .",
    "this maps the partition a ( a spin-1 chain with bipartition - induced critical dimerization ) to a spin-1/2 chain with an effective dimerization @xmath82 , since the lengths of a segments and b segments are equal .",
    "therefore , we arrive instantly at the critical point for the pure spin-1 chain with imposed dimerization ( i.e. , not due to spontaneous symmetry breaking ) .    now , in the case of the random bipartition the almost instantaneous arrival at the fixed point solution is also predicated on one another important condition : namely , our choice of the probability distribution for the segment length [ see eq .",
