    "the search for an effective nuclear matter theory has been one of the main goals of nuclear physics ( see , for instance , the pioneering work of fetter and walecka @xcite ) .",
    "the advances in experimental data acquisition has played an essential role on the improvement of nuclear models .",
    "one of the most required parameters to constrain symmetric nuclear matter models , the incompressibility @xcite , has had many contributions since the non - linear boguta and bodmer model @xcite was proposed as an alternative to the walecka model @xcite .",
    "the derivative coupling models proposed by zimanyi and moszkowski were also inspired to correct distortions in the incompressibility and effective nucleon mass determinations @xcite .    in this work",
    "we make use of the so called parametric coupling model ( pcm ) @xcite which describes nuclear matter with density dependent coupling constants .",
    "the pcm , presented in the next section has appeared in the literature after a first attempt to unify walecka and zm models in an unique model @xcite .",
    "the pcm was successful in reproducing the results obtained in the walecka @xcite , zm @xcite and exponential coupling models @xcite and even more successful in reproducing nuclear matter and neutron star main properties using special choices for the free parameters that define the density dependence of the coupling constants .",
    "the pcm has been used to study a wide range of problems , specially the nuclear matter compression modulus @xcite , the inclusion of strange meson fields @xcite and the hadron - quark phase transition @xcite .",
    "presently , an important issue in nuclear physics is to constrain the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) from compact star properties or from laboratory measurements such as the ones planned for the next - generation of exotic radioactive beam facilities at csr / china , fair / germany , riken / japan , spiral2(ganil)/france or the planned facility of rare isotope beams / usa , where the high density behavior of the symmetry energy will be further studied experimentally . while saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter such as the saturation density , binding energy and incompressibility are quite well settled , properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , such as the density dependence of the symmetry energy are much less constrained .",
    "many authors have recently tested nuclear models , both phenomenological @xcite , variational @xcite or microscopic @xcite such as the brueckner - hartree - fock formalism , in order to impose constraints or verify their compatibility with data coming from heavy ion collisions , giant monopole resonances or isobaric analog states .",
    "in particular , recent experimental constraints from isospin diffusion in heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) give for the slope parameter of the symmetry energy the value l = 88@xmath025 mev and for the isospin incompressibility coefficient @xmath1 mev @xcite .",
    "the latter is in agreement with the value of @xmath2 mev predicted by the independent measurement of the isotopic dependence of the giant monopole resonance in sn isotopes @xcite and the value @xmath3 mev obtained from the study of neutron skins @xcite . on the other hand isoscaling in hic",
    "favors @xmath4 mev @xcite and nucleon emission ratios favor @xmath5 mev @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to constrain even more the free parameters in the pcm by studying the symmetry energy and its density dependence through its slope and its second derivative with respect to the density .",
    "we try to establish some correlations between the symmetry energy and its density derivatives with quantities with astrophysical interest such as the crust - core crossing density , the density at muon and at strangeness onset , the maximum star mass , and the threshold star mass for direct urca @xcite .    in section [ sec : pcm ]",
    "we summarize the pcm , in section [ sec : esym ] the symmetry energy dependence on the density is discussed , the thermodynamic instabilities are discussed in section [ sec : thermo ] and the neutron star properties in section [ sec : ns ] .",
    "finally we draw some conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we first study the nuclear matter properties within the pcm .",
    "this model is based on the walecka model @xcite . however , in order to correct the values of the effective nucleon mass and incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density , taurines et .",
    "@xcite have introduced parametric couplings .",
    "they are introduced in a similar way as zimanyi and moszkowski included the derivative couplings in their models . here",
    "we briefly describe the model and the reader is addressed to ref .",

    "we have employed the parametric coupling model , developed by taurines _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite , to describe nuclear matter properties , in special , those related to the isospin channel which were still not investigated in the pcm model .",
    "some of the parameters of the model were fixed by the binding energy ( 15.75 mev ) and saturation density ( 0.16 @xmath14 ) for symmetric matter and by the symmetry energy ( 32.5 mev ) .",
    "we have tried to restrict the remaining parameters by reproducing experimental results obtained with heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies and neutron star properties .    considering a wide range of experimental data for the slope of the symmetry energy @xmath15 , 55 mev @xmath16 mev and for the symmetry term of the incompressibility of the nuclear eos @xmath17 , @xmath18 mev@xmath19 mev , we have ruled out some values of the free parameters .",
    "the models which best satisfy the constraints are : s and si , with @xmath20 and svi , with @xmath21 .",
    "model sv only presents values with good agreement with the @xmath15 and @xmath17 experimental values for @xmath22 .",
    "some properties of neutron star matter and neutron star structure have been described with the pcm for the range of the parameters restricted by the values of @xmath15 and @xmath17 , namely the maximum mass star configuration , and the densities of the onset of muons , strangeness and the direct urca process .",
    "it was shown that all properties were reasonably well described except the prediction of the direct urca process at a too low density .",
    "it was also shown that the density at the onset of muons is almost independent of the parameters of the model but the strangeness onset is sensitive to the symmetry energy slope : a larger slope corresponds to a smaller onset density .",
    "the same is true for the direct urca process , although with a slightly weaker dependence .",
    "it was also shown that the radius and mass of the maximum mass stable star configuration was correlated with the @xmath15 value : a larger @xmath15 corresponds to a larger radius and a larger mass .",
    "a similar correlation exists with the symmetry term of the incompressibility of nuclear matter .",
    "however from model to model this correlation has a different slope and a given value of @xmath15 and @xmath17 does not define in a unique way the neutron star properties .    even though the proposed range of validity of the parameters of the pcm are in agreement with the experimental range described above for heavy ions , it is of common belief that the slope of symmetry energy should be close to the lower limit of the interval 55 mev@xmath16 mev @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate other possibilities of the model , we have proposed new parametrizations chosen to reproduce the symmetry energy slope @xmath23=60 , 70 and 80 mev .",
    "these parametrizations have shown excellent results also for @xmath17 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the neutron star maximum mass but still predict quite low densities for the onset of the urca process . the results shown in tables",
    "[ tab5 ] and [ tab6 ] describe some of these results .",
    "we have tried to find a set of parameters which could predict a larger density for the onset of the direct urca process without success .",
    "the pcm present the same main features of the models discussed in @xcite which are not in agreement with urca expectations .",
    "we have constrained the free parameters of the pcm using the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , but it is important to mention that the eos which show the best results ( tables v and vi ) , for these properties are in perfect agreement with those imposed by the analysis of symmetric nuclear matter properties such as those described by @xcite where constraints , obtained from the analysis of nuclear matter flow in heavy ion collisions , were proposed for the high density eos of symmetric matter .",
    "this problem has been recently examined in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is also important to mention that the constraints imposed by asymmetric nuclear matter properties are stronger than the ones obtained from symmetric nuclear matter ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we have compared our results with two rmf models : nl3 with constant couplings and tw with density dependent coupling parameters ( table [ tw_nl3 ] ) .",
    "it was shown that the models si2 and svi2 predict results closer to tw except for the onset density of the urca process .",
    "these could be related to the larger @xmath26 value that tw has since all the other saturation properties are similar .",
    "it was also shown that while the density dependence of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 coupling parameters in pcm is similar to the one of tw , the density dependence of @xmath29 is very different .",
    "the relation between the symmetry energy and some properties of neutron stars was also discussed .",
    "the different models considered in the present study with one or more density dependent couplings , showed quite large differences among them , even for the same values of @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "we conclude that the properties of nuclear matter for both symmetric and asymmetric matter at saturation are not enough to define the structure of compact stars and experimental data at two , three times saturation density are required .",
