    "evidence has been mounting in recent years that turbulence plays an important role in determining the physical conditions of the neutral ism as well as for generating the hierarchy of structures seen in it ( see elmegreen & scalo ( 2004 ) and scalo & elmegreen ( 2004 ) for recent reviews ) .",
    "observational evidence includes the fact that the fluctuation power spectrum of a variety of tracers ( hi 21 cm emission intensity , hi 21 cm optical depth , dust emission ) is a scale free power law .",
    "the slope of the power law of hi 21 cm emission and absorption in our own galaxy , hi 21 cm emission from the lmc and smc are all @xmath6 ( crovisier & dickey ( 1983 ) ; green ( 1993 ) ; deshpande et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; elmegreen et al . ( 2001 ) ; stanimirovic et al . ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "similarly , the hi distribution in several dwarf galaxies in the m81 group appears to be fractal ( westpfahl et al.(1999 ) ) , consistent with there being no preferred length scale .",
    "this scale free behaviour is characteristic of a turbulent medium ; it is believed that the turbulence itself is driven by a combination energy input from spiral arms / bars and energy input from stellar sources ( supernovae , stellar winds etc . ) .",
    "previous quantitative measurements of the hi emission power spectrum have been limited to the few cases ( the milkyway , lmc and smc ) where the hi signal is extremely strong . in this paper , we discuss the power spectrum of the fluctuations of hi 21 cm emission intensity in ddo  210 , the faintest ( m@xmath7 ) gas rich member of the local group .",
    "we use a visibility based estimator of the power spectrum ; this is well suited to the current problem where the signal is buried deep in the noise .",
    "visibility based methods also have the advantage of having well understood statistics , and being free of the uncertainties involved in gridding and image deconvolution .",
    "the rest of the paper is divided as follows .",
    "the power spectrum estimator that we use is discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] , the ddo  210 data presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] , while the results of applying the estimator to this data are shown in sect .",
    "[ sec : result ] and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "the power spectrum of hi emission @xmath8 is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath9 of the fluctuations in the hi brightness distribution @xmath10 i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath12 here @xmath13 refers to directions on the sky and @xmath14 to inverse angular separations .",
    "the fourier relation in eqn .",
    "[ eq : a2 ] assumes that the angular extent of the galaxy is small , a spherical harmonic decomposition would be needed otherwise .",
    "further , it is assumed that the statistical properties of the small scale fluctuations in the hi distribution are homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the angular brackets denote an average across different positions and directions in the galaxy .",
    "it follows that the hi power spectrum @xmath15 is a function of only the magnitude @xmath16 .",
    "now , the complex visibility function measured by an interferometer is the fourier transform of the brightness distribution , @xmath17 it should be noted that @xmath14 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : a3 ] refers to the projected baselines or antenna separations in units of the wavelength of observation .",
    "the fourier relation in eqn .",
    "[ eq : a3 ] allows us to associate an inverse angular scale with every baseline @xmath14 which we also denote using a two dimensional vector @xmath18 .",
    "since the complex visibility measured by an radio interferometer is the fourier transform of the hi intensity distribution , the squared modulus of the visibility is a direct estimator of the power spectrum , @xmath19 where @xmath20 now denotes an average over all possible orientations of the baselines @xmath21 .",
    "this estimator has been used by both crovisier & dickey(1983 ) and green(1993 ) to measure the power spectrum of hi fluctuations in our own galaxy .",
    "[ eq : a3 ] is an idealised one , in practice the interferometer response differs from the fourier transform of the sky brightness both because it is modified by a window function and because there is added noise .",
    "we first consider the effect of the window function . in situations like in our own galaxy , where the hi emission fills the whole telescope beam ,",
    "the window function is simply the primary beam of the telescope . in situations where the hi emission is from , for e.g. , a distant galaxy",
    "whose angular extent is much smaller than the primary beam , the window function corresponds to the total extent of the hi emission .",
    "we will assume that , in general , the hi brightness distribution at any frequency @xmath22 can be written as    @xmath23 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath24(l , m ) is the window function which characterises the large scale hi distribution in the galaxy at frequency @xmath22 , @xmath25 is the mean hi brightness and @xmath26 characterises the small scale fluctuations . for a window function with angular extent @xmath27 , we expect its fourier transform , @xmath28 , to be sharply peaked at @xmath29 and to fall off rapidly for @xmath30 .",
    "then , at long baselines , where we can ignore the contribution from @xmath31 , the square of the complex visibility is the power spectrum @xmath32 convolved with the square of the fourier transform of the window function , i.e. @xmath33 both crovisier & dickey ( 1983 ) and green(1993 ) ignored the window function in their analysis , which is justified at large baselines if @xmath34 is sharply peaked at @xmath29 and decays much faster than @xmath15 .",
    "we now look at the effect of measurement noise .",
    "the measured visibility can be written as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the hi signal and @xmath37 is the noise . we then have    @xmath38    where we see that squaring the complex visibility makes the noise bias positive - definite . for hi",
    "emission from our own galaxy this noise bias is small compared to the signal . on the other hand",
    ", the noise bias can be orders of magnitude larger than the desired power spectrum in the case of faint external galaxies . in principle",
    ", one could estimate @xmath39 from a line free frequency channel and subtract it from @xmath40 for a channel with emission .",
    "however this requires that the noise statistics at different frequency channels be determined at an extremely high level of precision .",
    "uncertainties in the bandpass response usually render such high levels of precision unachievable .",
    "the problem of noise bias can be avoided by correlating the visibilities at two different baselines for which the noise is expected to be uncorrelated .",
    "the correlation between the visibilities measured on two slightly different baselines is :    @xmath41    @xmath42~d^2 \\vec u^ { ' } , \\label{eqn : corr}\\ ] ]    since @xmath28 falls off rapidly for @xmath30 , it then follows that the two shifted window functions in eqn .  [ eqn : corr ] will have a substantial overlap only if @xmath43 .",
    "thus visibilities at two different baselines will be correlated only as long as @xmath43 , and not beyond . in our analysis",
    "we restrict the difference in baselines to @xmath44 so that @xmath45 .",
    "the expected value of the visibility correlation now no longer depends on @xmath46 allowing us to introduce the notation @xmath47 and    @xmath48    we use the real part of the measured visibility correlation @xmath49 as an estimator of the hi power spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "this is the sum of the hi signal and a system noise contribution .",
    "the latter is unbiased and has a zero mean , its variance being determined by the noise statistics of the individual visibilities .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath49 is noise dominated .",
    "there will be a very small contribution from the hi signal because the assumption that @xmath45 is not strictly valid .",
    "the requirement that the imaginary part of @xmath49 should be small provides a self - consistency check and allows us to determine the range of validity of our formalism .",
    "a further simplification is possible for our estimator if we assume that @xmath50 decays much faster than variations in @xmath51 .",
    "such an assumption is justified at large baselines @xmath52 if , for example , @xmath15 is a power law .",
    "we then have    @xmath53 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : corra}\\ ] ]    where the quantity in square brackets @xmath54 $ ] in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : corra ] is a constant .",
    "we note that while @xmath55 directly estimates @xmath56 at large baselines @xmath57 , it is necessary to account for the convolution ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : corrn ] ) at small baselines @xmath58 .",
    "the utility of using visibility correlations as a statistical estimator of the hi power spectrum has been discussed previously by bharadwaj & sethi ( 2001 ) in the context of the large scale hi distribution at high redshifts .",
    "visibility based statistical techniques are also of interest in the efforts to detect the epoch of reionization through interferometric hi observations ( eg .",
    "@xcite;@xcite ) , and are also used in the analysis of interferometric observations of the cmbr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we apply the formalism developed above to interferometric observations of ddo  210 .",
    "since ddo  210 is relatively close ( at a distance of 950@xmath5950 kpc ; @xcite ) the observations have good spatial resolution as well as comparatively good signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "further , ddo 210 has been observed with both the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) ( swarup et al . 1991 ) and in multiple configurations of the very large array ( vla ) . a comparison of the power spectrum derived from these two independent data sets allows a robust check against systematic biases .",
    "the gmrt data for ddo 210 have been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we state the main observational results briefly below , the reader is referred to @xcite for a more details .",
    "the hi emission from ddo 210 spanned the central 25 channels of the 128 channel spectral cube ( with channel width @xmath601.7 kms@xmath61 ) .",
    "the hi disk of the galaxy is nearly face on . on large scales , the hi distribution is not axisymmetric ; the integrated hi column - density contours are elongated towards the east and south .",
    "the maximum angular extent of the hi distribution for the galaxy is @xmath62 and does not change significantly in the central 10 frequency channels .",
    "the vla observations have been discussed in @xcite . for the current analysis we use raw data downloaded from the vla archive and reanalysed by us .",
    "we estimated @xmath63 by correlating all the baselines within @xmath64 .",
    "this value of @xmath46 was chosen as a compromise between having sufficient visibility pairs to get a good snr and ensuring that @xmath46 itself remains small compared to @xmath65 .",
    "all self correlations ( i.e. correlations of a visibility with itself ) were excluded .",
    "the measured correlations were then binned in bins of @xmath66 width .",
    "each frequency channel was treated separately , and the analysis was also carried out on the line free frequency channels as a check .",
    "[ fig : gmrt_ps][a ] shows the absolute value of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath63 for a channel with hi emission , while fig .",
    "[ fig : gmrt_ps][b ] shows the same quantities for a channel with no emission . for the channel with emission",
    ", we find that at baselines less than @xmath67 the real and imaginary parts of @xmath49 are both positive , and the real part is substantially larger than the imaginary part .",
    "for the channel with no emission the real and imaginary parts are small and of comparable magnitude .",
    "this is in agreement with the cross - checks discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] for determining the reality of the signal .",
    "henceforth , we will ignore the imaginary part of @xmath63 and use the symbol @xmath68 to refer to only the real part .",
    "note that the apparent increase in the value of @xmath63 seen at the longer baselines in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmrt_ps][a]&[b ] is because the noise is large in this range and we are plotting the absolute value of the estimator .",
    "the increase in noise is a consequence of the sparse sampling of the outer parts of the uv - plane .",
    "[ fig : vla_ps ] shows @xmath63 determined separately from the gmrt and vla data ( for channels corresponding to very similar heliocentric velocity ) .",
    "the two estimates are in excellent agreement , which is a robust check on the reality of the signal .",
    "[ fig : vla_ps ] also shows @xmath69 error bars for the estimated power spectrum .",
    "the errors were computed by including both the effect of having a fine number of estimates of the true spectrum ( `` cosmic variance '' ) as well as having noisy visibility measurements .",
    "the first term was estimated as @xmath70 , while the second term was taken from the measured fluctuations of @xmath63 for channels with no hi emission .",
    "the total @xmath69 error bars were determined by combining the two contributions in quadrature . at small baselines @xmath71",
    ", the first term dominates the error budget , while the noise on the measured visibilities dominates at large baselines .",
    "if the observed power spectrum is due to turbulence in the interstellar medium , the slope of the derived power spectrum could change depending on the width of the frequency channel ( @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence gives rise to fluctuations in both the density and velocity of the gas and both of these contribute to the observed intensity fluctuations .",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) show that the statistical properties of the velocity and the density fluctuations can be disentangled if the slope of the observed power spectrum changes depending on whether the intensity is averaged over a velocity range that is large ( `` thick slices '' ) or small ( `` thin slices '' ) compared to the turbulent velocity dispersion . for ddo  210",
    "the observed velocity dispersion is @xmath72 km  s@xmath61and is approximately constant across the galaxy . @xmath63",
    "estimated from visibilities averaged across the 10 channels over which the emission has a similar spatial distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw_ps ] . within our measurement errors ,",
    "we find no change in the power spectrum with increasing velocity width in the range from @xmath73 km  s@xmath61to @xmath74 km  s@xmath61 .",
    "we discuss the implications of this in sec  [ sec : discuss ] , but we note here that in this means that one can work with the emission averaged over channels to improve the signal to noise ratio .    the power spectrum @xmath63 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw_ps ] appears to fall like a power law beyond a uv distance of @xmath75 .",
    "the best fit power law was determined by minimising @xmath76 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2 } \\label{eqn : chisquare}\\ ] ] with respect to the amplitude @xmath77 and the power law index @xmath5 .",
    "it is also necessary to fix the uv range while doing the fit . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw_ps ] , @xmath49 flattens below @xmath78 ; at these scales one would expect that the convolution with the window function @xmath79 would be important .",
    "if we assume that the convolution with the window function can be ignored for @xmath80 and do the minimisation described in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : chisquare ] with the lower limit fixed at @xmath81 , but several different upper limits @xmath82 , we find that the minimum @xmath83/dof decreases up to @xmath84 but not beyond . for the range @xmath85",
    "k@xmath86 the best fit power law index is @xmath5=@xmath87 .",
    "similarly , keeping @xmath88 , the best fit power law index for the uv - range @xmath89 k@xmath86 is @xmath5=@xmath90 .",
    "the best fit for the uv - range @xmath89 k@xmath86 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw_ps ] .",
    "we note that the best fit @xmath5 is largely determined by the smallest baselines @xmath91 as these have the smallest error bars , and it does not change significantly if @xmath92 is changed to say @xmath93 or even @xmath94 . as one goes to larger and larger",
    "baselines however , the minimum in the @xmath83 distribution gets more and more shallow ",
    "equivalently the error bars on @xmath5 get larger and larger .    to check the assumption that the convolution with the window function can be ignored for @xmath95 , we modelled the window function using a gaussian @xmath96 of width @xmath97 .",
    "for a power law form of @xmath15 we find that the convolution actually produces measurable deviations from the power law at @xmath98 .",
    "the observed power spectrum is _ steeper _ than the underlying power law spectrum in the range @xmath99 , while at baselines @xmath100 it is _ flatter _ than the underlying power law .",
    "we hence repeated the least squares fit to the observed power spectrum using a power law convolved with the assumed gaussian window function as the input model .",
    "for this model the best fit slope for the range @xmath101 is @xmath102 .",
    "the value of the best fit slope when including baselines @xmath103 could depend on how well the true window function has been modelled . in our analysis we have approximated this with a gaussian ; any deviations from a gaussian could introduce unknown biases in our estimate of the slope . with this consideration in mind , we also did fits for the restricted uv - range @xmath104 .",
    "for this uv - range , the best fit slope is @xmath2 . while the fit is good over the fitting range , the model substantially over estimates the power on large scales .",
    "this is consistent with the flatter slope ( @xmath105 ) obtained when fitting over the entire @xmath101 range , and might be indicative of a deviation from a power law on large scales .",
    "however , given the uncertainty in the modelling of the window function it is difficult to make a quantitative statement .",
    "on the other hand , our modelling does indicate that beyond about @xmath106 the effect of the window function is marginal . the value of the slope obtained after taking into account the convolution ( viz .",
    "@xmath107 ) is consistent within the error bars with the value @xmath108 obtained without accounting for the convolution .",
    "we hence adopt the value @xmath2 as slope of the intrinsic power law over these spatial scales .",
    "over the uv - range @xmath109 ( corresponding to spatial scales of 80pc - 500pc ) the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations in the dwarf galaxy ddo 210 is well described by a power law with slope @xmath2 .",
    "this value is very close to the slope of @xmath110 estimated from the hi emission in our own galaxy ( on spatial scales of @xmath60 5 pc to 200 pc ) by crovisier & dickey(1983 ) and green(1993 ) , and for the smc ( on spatial scales between @xmath6030  pc to 4  kpc ; stanimirovic et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the reason why the hi emission power spectrum has a similar slope in the milkyway as in a galaxy with more than 3 orders of magnitude less hi mass suggests that some fundamental physical process is responsible for determining the power spectrum slope .",
    "power spectral slopes @xmath6 are expected from optically thick turbulent gas ( @xcite ) . the hi emission from late type dwarfs like ddo  210",
    "is however expected to be optically thin , ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ) . models like those of @xcite which give a spectral slope @xmath6 in optically thin gas may be more relevant in this case .    unlike the milkyway , ddo  210 has no spiral arms and it also has no measurable star formation ( @xcite ) . the lack of dependence of the power spectrum slope on the star formation rate that we find is similar to the finding of dib et al . (",
    "2006 ) that the characteristic hi velocity dispersion in galaxies shows a minimum level that is independent of the star formation rate . in this aspect",
    ", the turbulence in the gas distribution appears to be different from that in the stellar distribution , where the power spectrum s slope does seem to depend on the star formation rate ( willett 2005 ) .",
    "it is possible that the energy source driving the hi turbulence is gravitational energy input on large scales .",
    "detailed simulations suggest that large scale gravitational energy input could explain the substantial turbulent velocity dispersion seen in the outer parts of the extended gas disk of ngc  2915 ( wada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) as well as for the rich structures seen in holmberg  ii ( dib & burket ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "gravitational energy input on large scales ( perhaps by tidal torques from other local group members ) would also be consistent with the asymmetric large scale hi distribution in ddo  210 .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , turbulence produces fluctuations in both the density and velocity fields , in turn , both of these contribute to fluctuations of the hi intensity .",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) show that the slope of the hi intensity power spectrum goes like @xmath111 when measured for channel widths that are `` thin '' compared to the turbulent velocity dispersion , while for channel widths that are `` thick '' compared to the velocity dispersion the hi intensity power spectrum s slope is @xmath112 , where @xmath112 is the slope of the power spectrum of density fluctuations and @xmath113 is the spectral slope of the velocity structure function .",
    "essentially , for velocity widths large compared to the velocity dispersion ( `` thick '' slices ) the velocity information gets averaged out and the intensity fluctuations represents density fluctuations .",
    "recall that we find that within the measurement errors the slope of the hi power spectrum does not change for velocity widths ranging from @xmath73  km  s@xmath61to @xmath74  km  s@xmath61 .",
    "the observed hi velocity dispersion of @xmath114 km  s@xmath61has contributions from both thermal and turbulent random motions .",
    "our `` thick '' channel is wider than the total velocity dispersion , and hence we can be sure that the detected power spectrum represents the power spectrum of the hi density fluctuations . since we get the same slope @xmath115 even for @xmath73 km  s@xmath61 channels , either the turbulence velocity dispersion is smaller than @xmath116 km  s@xmath61or @xmath117 .",
    "note that the latter possibility is consistent with @xmath118 which is predicted by the kolmogorov theory of turbulence .",
