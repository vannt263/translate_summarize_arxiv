    "radial velocity ( @xmath2 ) surveys for extrasolar planets have been extremely successful ( e.g. butler et al .",
    "these surveys have , however , largely excluded young , active stars @xcite .",
    "the reason given was that the activity levels of young stars is significant enough to cause large variations in the measured @xmath2 . although it does not introduce a true @xmath2 shift ( e.g. saar & donahue 1997 , hereafter sd97 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the apparent shift is caused by a change in the line shape of the absorption features .",
    "sd97 quantify the predicted amplitude of this phenomenon , and it has been observationally confirmed by several groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while detection of extrasolar planets around young stars will be complicated by these spectral line profile variations , there is much to learn about the frequency of planets and their orbital characteristics at all stellar ages .",
    "so , it is necessary to learn the limitations of the techniques employed in planet detection and then proceed ( if possible ) with planet searches .",
    "we present here the results of the radial velocity search for extrasolar planets in a sample of hyades dwarfs .",
    "primarily , we discuss the mean level of radial velocity noise caused by stellar magnetic activity and the possibilities of detecting planets in hyades - aged stars .",
    "we have been studying a sample of hyades dwarfs ranging from spectral classes f5 to m2 with the keck i high resolution echelle spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the observations and analysis of the @xmath2 data are discussed in @xcite .",
    "while we made every attempt to include only stars which were not binaries , we discovered some stars which have too high @xmath2 rms to be non - binaries .",
    "these stars are discussed in  5.2 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath2 involves using an i@xmath3 gas absorption cell as a standard velocity reference @xcite . a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath0150 - 300 is achieved at 5000  with resolution @xmath460,000 . in the case of high s / n ( @xmath5200 ) , we achieve an internal precision @xmath034  m  s@xmath1 for a given star @xcite ; while a spectrum with s / n@xmath0100 yields precision of @xmath06  m  s@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the exposure times are maintained at @xmath615 minutes .",
    "we use standard iraf packages to reduce the ccd images and extract the observed spectra .",
    "the @xmath2 measurements are made using a program called radial ( developed at the university of texas , ut , and mcdonald observatory ) to measure precise radial velocities .",
    "this program was adapted for use with data from all of the planet search programs affiliated with ut .",
    "discussions of radial may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 measurements of all data in this sample obtained with the keck telescope are listed in table 1 .",
    "measurements of vb  15 , vb  18 and vb  153 taken with the hrs at the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) are discussed and listed in paulson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( hereafter psc04 ) .",
    "while the target sample was selected in part on non - binarity , a handful of binaries did end up in our sample .",
    "the stars listed in table 2 show either significant linear trends ( most likely binaries ) or a defined binary orbit ( vb  88 ) .",
    "the measured @xmath2 of binary stars and stars with significant linear trends are shown in figure 1 .",
    "three binaries discovered by @xcite were not removed from the sample in the inital compilation of targets . these are noted in the column 3 of table 2 .",
    "stars which only have a small slope ( i.e. those with @xmath7  m  s@xmath1 ) have not been included in this table .",
    "vb  88 appears to have almost completed 1 orbit .",
    "a _ tenative _ solution ( shown in figure 1 ) gives an @xmath8sin@xmath9=0.07  m@xmath10 .",
    "using the measured @xmath11sin@xmath9 for vb  88 and and an estimate of the true rotational velocity as derived by @xcite , we estimate the mass of the companion to be @xmath00.86  @xmath12  0.31  m@xmath10 , most likely a k dwarf , to the f8v parent star . while 0.31  m@xmath10 is the formal error",
    ", we note that if the mass were much larger than 0.86  m@xmath10 , we would see a double lined spectrum and we see no indication of this in the vb  88 spectra .",
    "so , 0.86  m@xmath10 is most likely an upper limit to the true mass .",
    "the orbital parameters for this binary companion are listed in table 3 .    with three exceptions discussed later in this section ( those showing significant long - period trends ) and 1 star with poor sampling but with velocity rms of 72  m  s@xmath1 ,",
    "the remaining stars show no significant linear trends ( with rms ( @xmath13)@xmath1440  m  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "table 4 lists the program stars , the rms of the observations with internal errors removed ( @xmath15 ) and the average internal error of the observations for each star ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this is a summary of the observations presented in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows a histogram of the @xmath13 for the program stars excluding binaries and stars with linear trends .",
    "the internal @xmath2 errors have been removed .",
    "we note that the majority of stars have @xmath17 25 m  s@xmath1 , which is what we expect from stars of this activity level and age ( sd97 , psc04 ) . in psc04",
    ", we showed that some stars in the sample display @xmath2 variations of @xmath040  m  s@xmath1 due to stellar active regions .",
    "therefore , the stars with @xmath18 could also suffer from severe effects of activity .",
    "it is of interest that we do not find any stars in this sample with very large @xmath13 ( @xmath5100 m  s@xmath1 ) with suggestive short periods , thus no  hot jupiters \" with mass @xmath51 m@xmath19 .    to explore the spread in @xmath13 in the sample , we compared the @xmath13 of each star with the measured rotational velocity ( @xmath11sin@xmath9 ) from @xcite .",
    "although a little less than half of the program stars have measured @xmath11sin@xmath9 , we are still able to see an obvious trend in the data ( see figure 3- @xmath13 versus @xmath11sin@xmath9 , with binaries and stars with linear trends excluded and internal @xmath2 errors removed ) . while there is significant scatter in the figure , a trend is still present .",
    "the location of active regions , the fraction of the surface covered by activity , the rotational velocity and the inclination of the stars all play significant roles in the measured @xmath2 .",
    "the higher the @xmath11sin@xmath9 , the more broadened the spectral absorption features will be . the internal error becomes larger with increased @xmath11sin@xmath9 ( see figure 4 ) , as determination of the line center becomes increasingly difficult . as the inclination of the star decreases ( becomes pole - on )",
    "lower @xmath13 is expected .",
    "this is because the most significant effect of active regions in this age of star ( e.g. sd97 ) is short - period variations due to the rotational modulation of the features across the stellar surface .",
    "take a simple case which assumes active regions are equatorial .",
    "when the star is pole - on ( 0@xmath20 ) , variations of this nature will diminish and similarly , when the star is face - on ( 90@xmath20 ) , the effect will be at a maximum .",
    "certainly , the larger fraction of the stellar surface covered by active regions will cause larger amplitude variations and the physical location of the features will cause variable effects on the line shape ( and thus , the measured @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is not surprising , then , that there are a few stars with very large @xmath13 , as statistically , a few stars should have very low inclinations .",
    "this effect of increased @xmath13 with increased @xmath11sin@xmath9 is also predicted by a. hatzes ( 2003 , private communication ) and discussed in sd97 .",
    "additionally , scatter in @xmath13 ( in figure 3 ) at a given @xmath11sin@xmath9 is caused by star - to - star variations in the overall activity level .",
    "although the stars do not show cyclic behavior in chromospheric activity , the overall level of activity varies .    as also shown in psc04",
    ", some hyades stars ( vb  153 , in particular ) may show long lived active regions or active longitudes .",
    "therefore , should we detect significant periods compatible with an expected or observed rotation rate , we could explore the nature of stars which display this type of activity .",
    "therefore , to the remaining stars , we employed the same period - finding algorithm as used in psc04 ( that of horne & baliunas 1986 ) . from this technique",
    "we are able to determine the most significant periods in a data set and the false alarm probabilities ( fap ) associated with each period .",
    "we also perform a bootstrap algorithm ( e.g. krster et al .",
    "1997 ) to determine a false alarm probability based solely on the data .",
    "the bootstrap method does not assume a gaussian noise distribution as do the more traditional faps ( such as horne & baliunas 1986 ) .",
    "this method randomizes the data- keeping the observed times ( in jd ) the same but randomly assigning the @xmath2 observed to those jds .",
    "the resultant `` fake '' data are run through the periodogram to determine the most significant period of this data .",
    "this randomization process is iterated 1000 times and a false alarm probability is the ratio of the number of times the power of the detected period in the fake data was equal to or larger than the power of the signal in the original data",
    ". if the data are pure noise , then the false alarm probability should be very high ( @xmath01.0 ) .",
    "the results of this analysis are listed in table 5 for stars which had faps of less than 10% in each of the two methods ( horne & baliunas and bootstrap ) .",
    "we explore the actual significance of these periods in @xmath21  4 .",
    "it is not surprising that the periods we derive here are not consistent with the published values of rotation periods ( @xmath22 ) because active regions evolve .",
    "table 6 lists the periods we derive versus those from literature ( references included in the table notes ) and predicted values from @xcite , where possible .",
    "additionlly , the periods derived from the keck data for the stars which we have dervied @xmath22 ( from paulson et al .",
    "2004 for vb  15 , vb  18 and vb  153 ) are inconsistent with each other ( also see table 6 ) .",
    "thus , significant phase variations have occured in the span of observations of the data taken from keck .",
    "because we do not have sufficient temporal coverage , we are unable to perform detailed studies of the evolution of these active regions- the decay time or migration of the active regions .",
    "using the methods outlined in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter na98 ) we compute analytical limits on the detectability of substellar mass companions based on the duration and accuracy of the data for each star .",
    "we then compare this to a periodogram - based analytical derivation to find significant peaks representing the significant signals in the data . at frequencies where peaks cross the analytical limits ,",
    "the detection of periodic signals ( either companions or periodic activity ) is present at the 99% confidence level .    from eq . 4 of na98 , the companion mass is @xmath23  sin@xmath9=@xmath24 , where @xmath9 is the inclination of the companion , @xmath25 is the period sampled , @xmath26 is the velocity amplitude , @xmath27 is the mass of the parent star , and @xmath28 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we derive @xmath26 and @xmath25 from the above periodogram analysis and @xmath27 is estimated from b - v measurements @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will refer to the resultant @xmath23  sin@xmath9 as the `` companion mass power spectrum '' ( solid curve in figure 5 ) .    to define the limits on companion masses detected ( or significant periodicity from intrinsic sources )",
    ", we must calculate the limit on the detectable velocity .",
    "@xmath29 ( eq . 15 in na98 ) is the velocity amplitude exceeded by any of the @xmath30 fits to randomized data in a given period range with probability 1@xmath31@xmath32 , where @xmath32 is the product of probabilities of each fit at each period sampled ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 is the number of sampled periods .",
    "thus , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the duration of the original data ( jd@xmath37 ) and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lower and upper limits , respectively , of the period intervals ( in our case , 4 bins per dex ) .",
    "@xmath32 is determined from the bootstrap `` false alarm probability '' described in @xmath21  3 . using @xmath40 now in place of @xmath26 in eq .",
    "4 ( na98 ) , we obtain the 99% confidence level of the mass limits of companions . shown in figure 5",
    "are representative cases of these calculations .",
    "we show both the keck and het data with two different error assumptions , described below , for 3 stars .",
    "the keck data for all stars show the same behavior as the three stars shown in figure 5 .",
    "thus , we only show here these three because we also have data from the het for each .",
    "the histogram plot limits have been suppressed at 1 year and 11 years for het and keck data , respectively .",
    "the dashed histogram lines in figure 5 assume that the only error in the observations are internal effects ( @xmath04 - 7  m  s@xmath1 ) . in the het data",
    "( left column ) , we discover significant peaks crossing the 99% threshold .",
    "this tells us that there are significant periods at these crossings .",
    "however , these significant periods do not correspond to companions but to the rotational period of the star and aliases thereof . for the keck data ( right column ) , there are several crossings .",
    "this is expected as the sampling is extremely poor .",
    "there are @xmath015 - 20 observations of these stars over the course of 6 years , and many `` significant '' periods can be derived with this quality of sampling .",
    "a far superior assumption , and that recommended by na98 , is that the error in the observations is not only due to internal errors but also due to the rotational modulation of active regions . for this",
    ", we assume an error equal to the mean @xmath2 rms for the sample ( @xmath016  m  s@xmath1 , ignoring stars with linear trends and binary stars ) .",
    "thus , any period spikes that cross the 99% threshold _ should _ come from external sources ( stellar and substellar companions ) .",
    "the calculation using this assumption is depicted by the solid histogram lines in figure 5 .",
    "we note that for all non - binary stars , there are absolutely no companion mass power spectrum crossings of the 99% threshold for stars in these keck data .",
    "the binary stars have insufficent phase coverage .",
    "so , the threshold crossings are beyond the reasonable limits of the calculations described above .",
    "thus , we can use this method for determining the value of `` significant '' periods derived from a periodogram analysis quite apart from a calculated false alarm probability .    in general",
    ", we can provide constraints on the characteristics of systems which are detectable around young stars via the radial velocity technique , also employing the methods in na98 .",
    "figure 6 presents an analysis for stars of hyades age with different sampling .",
    "both panels show the @xmath26 velocity semi - amplitude versus orbital period .",
    "the histograms are the limits for a 99% confidence detection .",
    "the solid histogram ( a ) represents sampling similar to that which we observed from keck , while the dotted histogram ( b ) is similar to the sampling we obtained from het . the dotted histogram has been suppressed beyond 1 year .",
    "the two curves shown are for reference- the solid curve ( c ) is a 1 m@xmath19 companion and the dotted curve ( d ) is a 3 m@xmath19 companion .",
    "these curves are the @xmath26 velocities of companions given that they are in orbits with zero eccentricity and are companions to a 1 m@xmath10 star with 90@xmath20 inclination .",
    "the velocity - period space laying above the histograms are detectable with 99% confidence .",
    "so , for example , the top panel representing data with errors ( radial velocity jitter from activity + internal errors ) of @xmath41=16  m  s@xmath1 shows that a 1  m@xmath19 companion is only detectable if it has periods less than @xmath0100 days with only a few observations a year for 5 years and is detectable if with longer orbital periods only if the sampling is quite good ( several observations a month ) . on the other hand",
    ", the bottom panel shows a more realistic case , as the true noise from activity will be higher than 16  m  s@xmath1 if the system is edge on ( corresponding to the @xmath26 curves c and d which are for edge on orbits ) . for data with errors of @xmath41=40  m  s@xmath1 , the detectabiliy of planets with @xmath421 m@xmath19 becomes impossible for poor sampling . for young stars with such high levels of activity",
    "related radial velocity noise , it is only feasible to look for either very high mass companions or the data must be taken with extremely good sampling ( several observations a month for @xmath03 months ) .",
    "we can determine significant period in data by various techniques , including those discussed in this paper .",
    "but , it is most useful to understand when significant periods are real or simply artifacts of sampling .",
    "the analysis of the periodogram produces periods with faps  @xmath010% for several stars . phasing the data to these periods produces periodic curves ( by - eye inspection ) .",
    "this is inadequate .",
    "therefore , we have employed the method of @xcite to explore the significance of detections .",
    "all short - periods detected turn out to be artifacts of the sampling and of the quality of the data .",
    "the detection of planets around young stars is complicated by the rotational modulation of stellar active regions .",
    "the activity not only causes high levels of @xmath2 noise but can also yield periodic variations in the measured @xmath2 causing false detections .",
    "the procedure we adopted @xcite picks out all significant signals given the quantity and quality of data , so we must be careful in the identification of the source of variability . in our data",
    ", we find no evidence for short - period massive planets or brown dwarfs . finally , of the 94 stars in this sample ,",
    "6 are either suspected or identified binaries and 1 has a velocity rms which is somewhat arge but further observations are required to say anything more concrete- it is still within possible",
    " jitter \" from high activity levels .",
    "future detection of extrasolar planets around young stars via the radial velocity method will be limited to high - mass planets and in particular , those with short orbital periods .",
    "constraints on telescope time needed for these surveys becomes clear . in order to increase the odds of planet detection , as current planet searches have determined that only @xmath01% of stars do have  hot jupiters \" , data must be sampled several times a month which requires a great deal of allocated telescope time .",
