    "in this paper we study the effects of radiative corrections on the gaugino and higgsino masses in the minimal supersymmetric model . in a grand unified model",
    "the gaugino masses at the gut scale are given by the common mass @xmath2 .",
    "using the one - loop renormalization group equations@xcite , the gaugino mass parameters @xmath3 and the gluino mass @xmath4 are given at a scale @xmath5 by @xmath6 which yields the relations @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we assume these gut relations in this paper .",
    "it is typical in analyses to assume that elements of the gaugino / higgsino sector are lighter than the lightest elements of the squark / slepton sector , and this is required if the dark matter candidate is the lightest neutralino . in such a scenario , we might expect that members of the gaugino / higgsino sector would be the first superpartners to be discovered at a particle collider .",
    "it is therefore of interest to determine the corrections that these particle masses receive .",
    "until these particles are discovered , the corrections are useful in that they modify the region of parameter space which is ruled out by experiment . in the event that the gaugino and higgsino particles are discovered these corrections",
    "would provide for a detailed check of the viability of the mssm .",
    "we divide the following discussion into four parts . in the next section",
    "we discuss the radiatively generated mass for a gluino which is massless at tree level . in section 3",
    "we discuss the corrections to the gluino mass in the case @xmath9  gev . in section 4",
    "we discuss the complete corrections to the neutralino and chargino masses , and the last section is reserved for the conclusions .",
    "there is some controversy as to whether light gluinos ( @xmath10 3  gev ) have been ruled out by existing data@xcite . the bounds from the non - observation of the decay mode @xmath11 @xcite are model dependent@xcite ( @xmath12 is the @xmath13 pseudoscalar bound state ) .",
    "ref.@xcite concludes that these searches exclude 3  gev @xmath14  gev , leaving the window @xmath15  gev open if @xmath16 .",
    "bounds determined from beam dump experiments@xcite depend on the gluino lifetime and may not rule out very light gluinos if the squark masses are in the tev range .",
    "thus , it appears further experiments are needed to conclusively rule out the possibility of light gluinos , especially long lived gluinos with mass @xmath17  gev ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "interest in the possibility of light gluinos has been piqued recently in response to the observation that a light gluino could reconcile the apparent discrepancy between ( central ) values of @xmath18 as determined from high and low energy experiments@xcite .    in this section",
    "we examine the gluino mass generated entirely by one - loop radiative corrections in the event @xmath4=0 . at one - loop ,",
    "the solution to the rge for the parameter @xmath19 , together with the gut scale boundary condition @xmath2=0 would ensure @xmath4=0 . considering the two - loop rge for the gluino mass@xcite , we see that if both @xmath2 and the @xmath20-terms vanish at the gut scale , again we would find a massless gluino at tree level . in any event",
    ", if the parameter @xmath21 is small ( @xmath22  few gev ) then the correction given below can simply be added to it .",
    "the contribution to the gluino mass for @xmath23 due to the top / stop loop is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the angle which rotates the squarks from the left - right to the mass eigenstate basis .",
    "changing the scale at which the strong coupling is evaluated from @xmath27 ( 160  gev ) to @xmath28 ( 1 tev ) reduces the gluino mass by 14% ( we set @xmath29 ) .",
    "we sum over the six quarks , but only the top / stop contribution matters except at large values of @xmath30 , where the bottom / sbottom contribution can be non - negligible .",
    "we note here that our result for the gluino mass , as well as the photino mass , is larger by a factor of 2 relative to those of refs .",
    "we believe that our result is correct since the cancellation of infinities in the gluino and neutralino masses depends on it .    for a given flavor ,",
    "the squark masses and rotating angle @xmath31 are determined from the squark mass matrix . for up",
    "type squarks , for example , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 we prefer to present our results in terms of the underlying parameters @xmath34 and @xmath20 .",
    "we discuss the results for a common @xmath20-term , @xmath35 , and a common right - handed squark mass @xmath36 .",
    "we set the top quark mass to 160  gev . in fig.1(a ) we show gluino mass contours in the @xmath37 plane , with @xmath38 @xmath39 = @xmath40=200  gev , and @xmath20=0 .",
    "we consider the range @xmath41  gev , and @xmath42  gev .",
    "we note that the gluino mass is at most about 3  gev .",
    "it is equal to 0 near @xmath43 , since in this case there is no mixing between left and right stop squarks",
    ". the mass increases as we move away from the no - mixing line until we reach the boundary of the parameter space , defined by the requirement that the squared squark masses are positive .",
    "the @xmath44 s on figs.1(a , c , d ) mark unphysical regions of parameter space . as we increase @xmath45 the allowed parameter space increases and    = 4.33 in    the bound on the gluino mass generally decreases . for example , in fig.1(b ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 are increased to 1  tev , and the maximum gluino mass is about 700 mev .",
    "the dependence of the contour plots in figs.1(a , b ) on @xmath30 and @xmath20 is easily understood , since for small @xmath30 the gluino mass depends directly on the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath30 through the combination @xmath49 . therefore changing @xmath20 or @xmath30 amounts to simply a shift or rescaling of the y - axis of these figures . for large @xmath30",
    "the dependence is more complicated , since the bottom - sbottom sector becomes non - negligible , and the parameter space is more severely constrained . in fig.1(c ) we show the gluino mass contours for @xmath50=@xmath40=200  gev , and @xmath51 .",
    "the gluino mass in this case varies from 0 at @xmath5=0 to about 400  mev .",
    "again , the bound is reduced if we increase @xmath52 . for @xmath53=@xmath54=1 tev and",
    "@xmath55 the gluino mass is at most 120 mev .",
    "as we vary @xmath20 when @xmath30 is large the pattern of the gluino mass contours in the @xmath37 plane changes dramatically , as can be seen in fig.1(d ) , where @xmath20 is increased to 300  gev . finally , we note that if we instead examine contours in the @xmath56 , plane keeping @xmath57 constant , we get essentially the same results .",
    "this is due to the fact that in @xmath58 defined above , @xmath57 and @xmath46 dominate the contribution of the d - terms which are proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "this is true especially at @xmath60 but it persist for larger values of @xmath30 as well .",
    "in this section we consider radiative corrections to the gluino mass in the case @xmath61",
    ". naturally the gluino mass limits referred to in this section assume that light gluinos are excluded .",
    "the cdf collaboration obtained the bound @xmath62  gev under the unrealistic assumption that the branching ratio @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "they also included the effects of cascade decays@xcite in their analysis and , for a particular choice of parameters , obtained a bound @xmath64  gev @xcite .",
    "if the unification condition for the gaugino masses is assumed , combining the lep limits on chargino and neutralino masses@xcite with the gluino cascade analysis further constrains the gluino mass bound ( and the bound then becomes @xmath5 and @xmath30 dependent ) .",
    "such an analysis was carried out in ref.@xcite , where , for a typical choice of parameters , they obtained @xmath65 .",
    "hidaka @xcite performed a similar analysis , obtaining the @xmath5 and @xmath30 independent bound @xmath66 .",
    "however , the starting point for both of these last two reference s analysis was @xmath67  gev with @xmath68 , a preliminary cdf result .",
    "hence , these bounds should be relaxed accordingly .",
    "a reasonable lower bound on the gluino mass is @xmath69  gev @xcite .",
    "the one - loop corrected gluino mass is given by @xmath70 @xmath71 \\label{gluino mass}\\ ] ] @xmath72,\\ ] ] where we evaluate @xmath73 at the scale @xmath4 .",
    "we take the tree level gluino mass to be @xmath21 .",
    "the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be found in ref.@xcite , except that here we adopt the metric @xmath76 .",
    "the hatted @xmath75 s refer to the function @xmath75 with the infinite part ( proportional to @xmath77 ) subtracted .",
    "we list in eq.([gluino mass ] ) the gluon contribution , followed by the quark / squark contributions . in the first sum over quarks",
    "we include all six flavors , while in the second we indicate that the sum is relevant only for @xmath78 and @xmath79 quarks . we note that the one - loop level @xmath5 dependence of the parameter @xmath80 in eq.([gluino mass ] ) cancels against the @xmath5 dependence of the one - loop correction .    given a measurement of the physical gluino mass , we are interested in determining the value of the underlying parameter @xmath4 , which will then yield a prediction for the other gaugino mass parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 via eq.([gutrelation ] ) . to this end",
    "we plot in fig.2(a ) @xmath4 vs. @xmath83 , for @xmath27=160 gev . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will refer to a common squark mass parameter @xmath84 , defined by @xmath85 , where @xmath20 is the common @xmath20-term .",
    "( in the plots of figs.2 we set @xmath30=1.5 and @xmath86  gev , but the results are insensitive to the values of these parameters ) .",
    "we see that a measured mass @xmath87  gev would imply @xmath4=69  gev ( 84  gev ) for @xmath88  gev ( 160  gev ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the tree level relation @xmath89 .",
    "this amounts to a 15% to 40% correction to this relation for gluino masses at the present limit of 125  gev . in a grand unified context",
    "the gluino mass would typically be taken to be the parameter @xmath4 evaluated at the scale @xmath4 .",
    "we show the error in neglecting the low energy threshold corrections in this case in fig.2(b ) , where we plot the relative correction to the gluino mass vs. @xmath4 for three values of the squark mass parameter @xmath84 .",
    "the left endpoints of the curves in fig.2(b ) correspond to @xmath87  gev . for values of @xmath4",
    "less than the quark / squark thresholds the corrections are generally appreciable",
    ". however , once @xmath4 is larger than the quark / squark thresholds the relative correction to the tree level mass is small ( @xmath901% ) and asymptotically approaches the value @xmath91 .",
    "in the mssm the superpartners of the neutral higgs bosons and @xmath92 gauge bosons mix to form the mass eigenstates ( in order of increasing mass ) @xmath93 and @xmath94 . similarly , the charginos are the mass eigenstates of the charged gauginos and higgsinos , and are denoted @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( see ref . ) . a lower bound on the lightest neutralino mass in the mssm",
    "was first obtained using combined lep and ua2/cdf data in ref.@xcite , and more recently lower bounds on all of the neutralino and chargino masses were given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the corrections to the neutralino and chargino masses were studied in ref.@xcite including only the top / stop sector contributions , and in ref.@xcite , including the lepton / slepton and quark / squark contributions . in this section",
    "we present the the complete corrections to the chargino and neutralino masses , including the gauge / higgs / gaugino / higgsino sector , thus completing the calculation of ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we found the corrections due to matter loops were commonly of order 5% .",
    "as the corrections due to the gauge / higgs / gaugino / higgsino sector are expected to be of this same order , they must be included in order to obtain a reliable result .    for consistency",
    "we use the same formalism as in ref.@xcite which we shall not repeat here .",
    "we point out one inconsequential modification , which we adopt for technical reasons .",
    "specifically , when computing the masses , defined as the poles of the relevant two - point greens functions , we need to determine counterterms for the various input parameters that enter the calculation .",
    "one of these counterterms is @xmath97 , where @xmath30 is the ratio of the the two vevs of the higgs fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in our renormalization scheme",
    "we take @xmath97 to be purely infinite , i.e. proportional to @xmath100 in dimensional regularization .",
    "since @xmath97 is purely infinite , it will not contribute to the final finite result .",
    "yet , it is important to have an expression for it in order to check the crucial cancellation of infinities , which must occur in a renormalizable theory . in ref.@xcite",
    "we determined @xmath97 from the higgs sector . in the present work",
    "we determine it from the chargino - neutralino sector .",
    "in particular , we demand that the the chargino masses , as well as the trace of the eigenvalues and the squares of the eigenvalues of the neutralino mass matrix , are finite .",
    "this determines the counterterms @xmath101 and @xmath97 .",
    "notice that even after imposing finiteness of these quantities it is still nontrivial to check that all of the individual neutralino masses are finite .",
    "in addition , we explicitly checked that we get the same value for @xmath97 whether we calculate it from the higgs sector or the chargino - neutralino sector .",
    "the self - energies of the gauge bosons , which enter in the computation of the counterterms , can be found in ref.@xcite differs by a sign from ref.@xcite .",
    "we point out two typographical errors in the formulas for the gauge boson self - energies given in ref.@xcite .",
    "first , in the formula for @xmath102 , eq.(a.15 ) , @xmath103 in the term @xmath104 should be replaced by @xmath105 .",
    "second , in the equation for @xmath106 , eq.(a.20 ) , the @xmath107 in the term @xmath108 should be @xmath109 . ] .",
    "the physical chargino and neutralino masses are given by @xcite @xmath110 @xmath111 where the @xmath112 s are form factors of the one - loop fermion self - energy @xmath113 and the @xmath114 are the masses obtained by replacing each bare parameter @xmath115 in the tree level neutralino and chargino mass formulas by the renormalized parameter plus the corresponding counterterm , @xmath116 .",
    "( here the @xmath117 refer to the parameters @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath5 , and @xmath30 ; see ref.@xcite for details . )",
    "the gauge / higgs / gaugino / higgsino contributions to the relevant chargino and neutralino self - energies are given in the appendix .",
    "we set the top mass to 160  gev and the _ cp_-odd higgs boson mass @xmath120 to @xmath121 in the following .",
    "the results depend mildly on the scale of the higgs boson sector , especially for any @xmath122 .",
    "the tree level masses are functions of the underlying parameters @xmath123 and @xmath30 . in our renormalization scheme",
    "these parameters are identified with the @xmath124-running parameters @xmath125 etc . , and",
    "hence they have a renormalization scale dependence .",
    "while the @xmath126 dependence cancels in the result for the physical masses , the corrections ( @xmath127 or @xmath128 ) do depend on the scales chosen for the evaluation of the tree level masses .",
    "we    = 7.6 in    = 7.8 in    choose to evaluate the tree level masses with the parameters @xmath129 and @xmath130 .    in figs.3(a - c ) we plot the mass contours of @xmath131 and @xmath132 in the @xmath133 plane at tree ( dashed lines ) and one - loop ( solid lines ) level , for @xmath134 and @xmath135  tev . in figs.4(a - c ) we show the mass contours of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , for @xmath138 .",
    "the shaded regions on these figures indicate the excluded regions of parameter space due to negative searches and line - shape measurements at lep@xcite . because the corrections are in general positive , there is a smaller region of parameter space ruled out at one - loop level .",
    "the light shaded regions shown in figs.3 and 4 are ruled out at one - loop level , while the adjacent strips of dark shading indicate the additional region which is ruled out if the chargino and neutralino masses are considered at tree level .",
    "the boundary of the excluded region is determined largely from the bound @xmath139  gev @xcite .",
    "the region below the dotted ( dash - dotted ) horizontal line in figs.3 is excluded at tree level ( one - loop level ) by considering the non - observation of gluinos by cdf and assuming the gut relation eq.([gutrelation ] ) .",
    "the horizontal lines on the plots correspond to @xmath69  gev , which translates by eqs.([gutrelation],[gluino mass ] ) into @xmath140  gev ( 25  gev ) at tree level ( one - loop level ) .",
    "the bound @xmath69  gev provides no additional excluded region beyond the region that is already excluded by lep for @xmath141 .",
    "we note that for a given @xmath30 the results for the lightest chargino and neutralino are qualitatively similar , and the same is true for the heaviest chargino and neutralino . for @xmath134 and @xmath86",
    "gev a measured @xmath142 mass of 100  gev would imply @xmath143  gev if the tree level relation is used , while taking into account radiative corrections we obtain @xmath144  gev . generically , the corrections @xmath127 are below 10  gev ( 12  gev ) in the region @xmath145  gev , @xmath146  gev at @xmath30=@xmath147 ( @xmath30=40 ) and they increase as we move away from the excluded region . for the next - to - lightest neutralino and lightest chargino with @xmath148  gev and @xmath149  gev we can obtain a correction @xmath127 greater than 14  gev .",
    "= 3.5 in    we illustrate that the corrections depend strongly on the squark mass in fig.5 , where we show a contour plot of the percentage correction for the lightest neutralino mass in the @xmath133 plane for @xmath150 and @xmath135  tev ( solid lines ) , as well as for @xmath151  gev ( dotted lines ) .",
    "also shown is the excluded region at one - loop with @xmath135  tev .",
    "we see that in most of the parameter space the correction is @xmath152 for @xmath84=1  tev , and @xmath153 for @xmath151  gev . for @xmath135 tev",
    "the corrections are significantly larger for smaller @xmath30 or larger @xmath27 .",
    "the 12% contour line shown in fig.5 increases to 23% if @xmath154 .    generally , the relative corrections are smaller for the heavier particles .",
    "for example , with @xmath134 and @xmath84=1  tev we obtain , in the region of parameter space shown in fig.5 , a correction between 5% and 15% for @xmath155 , a 3 - 7% correction for @xmath156 , and for @xmath157 and @xmath96 a correction of 3 - 4% .    we find that the corrections can depend strongly on @xmath30 . in figs.6(a , b ) we plot the relative correction to the neutralino and chargino masses vs. @xmath30 for two different choices of @xmath82 and @xmath5 .",
    "we note that for a given choice of the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath5 typically the lightest chargino and the two lightest neutralinos will be predominantly higgsinos , with the heavier particles being predominantly gauginos , or vice versa .",
    "the relative correction is fairly independent of @xmath30 for the gauginos .",
    "however , when the particle in question is mainly a higgsino , as we increase @xmath30 from 1 to 2 the correction decreases as the top yukawa coupling decreases . for @xmath158",
    "the higgsino corrections are fairly constant . increasing @xmath30",
    "further , the bottom yukawa becomes important and @xmath128 increases again .",
    "the relative corrections at @xmath30=1 and @xmath30=30 are about equal .",
    "the gauge / higgs / gaugino / higgsino contributions to the corrections are comparable to those of the matter sector in certain regions of parameter space .",
    "for example , for @xmath159  gev , @xmath160 gev , @xmath161 and @xmath135 tev , the correction due to the matter sector is 5  gev for @xmath94 and @xmath96 , while the correction from the gauge / higgs sector is about 7  gev .",
    "similarly , for @xmath156 and @xmath95 in this region the matter correction is 7  gev , while the gauge correction is 5 to 6  gev .",
    "the gauge / higgs relative corrections are small ; in the experimentally allowed part of the region @xmath162  gev , @xmath163  gev , we find the corrections are usually in the range @xmath164 to 1% , and they are always less than 3% .    to conclude this section we list in table 1 the lower bounds on the neutralino and chargino masses , independent of @xmath165 and    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath30 ( we require @xmath166 ) . in the first row",
    ", we show the lower bounds for the masses of the various particles at one - loop level , with @xmath167  gev and @xmath84=1 tev .",
    "we determine these limits by finding the minimum @xmath168 mass in the experimentally allowed region of parameter space , where both the masses and the boundary of the excluded region include the one - loop mass corrections .",
    "in particular we have the limits from the cdf cascade analysis @xmath69  gev @xcite , and from lep searches @xmath169  gev @xcite .",
    "we note that , excepting the lightest neutralino , these are essentially the same limits found at tree level in ref.@xcite . in the second row of table 1",
    "we list the relative difference ( in percent ) between our tree level determination of the lower bounds and the one - loop results .",
    "in particular , we find that the minimum @xmath170 mass at tree level is 19.6  gev . excepting @xmath170 , the difference between the tree and one - loop determinations are all about 1% or less .",
    "these small differences are the result of cancellations .",
    "both the boundary of the excluded region and the mass contours of all the particles shift in the same direction , so that the net effect is small .",
    "this cancellation is illustrated in fig.4(a ) of ref.@xcite . by way of contrast , for @xmath156 ( @xmath171 ) , the masses at tree and one - loop level differ by 10%  ( 5% ) for fixed @xmath5 , @xmath82 and @xmath30 in the neighborhood of the minimum . because the contours all shift relative to each other the cancellation is independent of the parameters which affect the overall size of the corrections .",
    "this is illustrated in the third row of table 1 , where we show the relative difference between the tree level and one - loop level lower bounds , setting @xmath172  gev and @xmath173  tev .",
    "again , excepting @xmath170 , the differences are small .",
    "the cancellation of electroweak corrections is not apparent for the lower bound deduced for the mass of the lightest neutralino because it finds its minimum value at a point in parameter space at which the gluino mass takes its lowest value .",
    "thus , because the gluino mass bound receives strong corrections as discussed in section 3 it is clear that the cancellations can not occur for @xmath170 .",
    "however , there is some cancellation taking place . for a gluino mass correction of 30% , the corresponding 30% shift in @xmath82 ( and @xmath81 )",
    "changes the tree level @xmath170 mass by about 27% .",
    "the one - loop correction to the @xmath170 mass partially compensates for this correction , and the net effect is about a 20% shift .",
    "the chargino and neutralino mass limits are not likely to increase much in the near future .",
    "excepting the lightest neutralino , all of the particles find their minimum values at points in parameter space essentially at the kinematic limit of lep .",
    "additionally , the points are far from the gluino mass bound .",
    "the @xmath170 mass limit increases proportionally to the gluino mass bound as @xmath174 for gluino mass limits up to 155  gev .",
    "the @xmath156 mass limit remains unaffected for gluino mass bounds up to 180  gev , the @xmath94 and @xmath96 limits are unaffected for gluino mass bounds up to 220  gev , and the @xmath171 limit is independent of the gluino mass limit up to @xmath175  gev .",
    "we have computed all of the one - loop radiative corrections to the gaugino and higgsino masses in the mssm .",
    "we performed the diagrammatic calculation in the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "we first considered the radiatively generated mass for a gluino which is massless at tree level .",
    "this mass falls generally in the `` light gluino window '' , @xmath1763  gev .",
    "there is by no means a consensus in the literature as to whether gluinos in this mass range have already been excluded by current experimental data .",
    "if such a light gluino were discovered , it would be compelling evidence for the condition @xmath177 at the gut scale , and it would greatly constrain the parameters in the top / stop sector of the mssm .",
    "next , we discussed the corrections to the mass of a massive gluino .",
    "we found large @xmath178(20% ) corrections for values of the gluino mass below the quark / squark thresholds , and small @xmath179 corrections for gluino masses above the quark / squark thresholds .",
    "these corrections must be considered when relating the gluino mass to the mass parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 which enter into the evaluation of the chargino and neutralino masses .",
    "lastly , we discussed the results for the corrections to the neutralino and chargino masses . while the corrections from the gauge / higgs sector can be as large as those from the matter sector , the gauge / higgs sector corrections are never as large as 3% .",
    "the complete corrections are typically 3 - 8% .",
    "these corrections are relevant when determining the values of the underlying parameters from a set of physical @xmath168 masses .",
    "the underlying parameters can then be used to constrain or make predictions for other sectors of the theory .",
    "for example , @xmath5 enters into the higgs boson and heavy quark / squark sectors , and @xmath30 enters into the higgs , fermion / sfermion and quark / squark sectors .",
    "alternatively , given a set of underlying parameters @xmath180 etc .",
    ", at some high ( e.g. gut ) scale , the parameters can be determined at a low scale via the renormalization group equations and the corrections presented here can then determine the physical spectrum of gaugino and higgsino masses .",
    "of course the physical spectrum is independent of the scale at which the rge evolution is terminated , up to higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we showed how the presently excluded region of parameter space is affected when the mass corrections are considered , and we found the one - loop lower bounds on the neutralino and chargino masses . excepting the lightest neutralino ,",
    "the difference between the tree and one - loop determinations of the lower bounds were found to be small ( @xmath181 ) , due to cancellations .",
    "the @xmath170 lower bound receives 20% corrections .",
    "below we list the relevant one loop self - energies for the charginos and neutralinos , including only the gauge / higgs particles and their partners in loop .",
    "the matter loop contributions can be found in ref .",

    "<S> we determine the radiative corrections to the masses of the gauginos and higgsinos in the mssm , including all sectors of the theory in a one - loop calculation in the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme . </S>",

    "<S> this radiatively generated mass depends directly on the off - diagonal element of the squark mass matrix . in the case of a massive gluino , its mass receives typically large corrections , as large as 40% for a 125  gev gluino . </S>",

    "<S> the lightest neutralino , which can receive corrections larger than 25% , receives @xmath1 corrections over most of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our results with the results of lep and cdf searches to obtain the lower bounds on the neutralino and chargino masses at one - loop . </S>",
