    "cp - violation was first observed through @xmath14 decay in 1964 @xcite .",
    "more cp - violation effects have been discovered in k- and b- meson sectors since then @xcite . in 1973 ,",
    "kobayashi and maskawa propose @xcite that if there exist three or more generations of fermions , one or more nontrivial phase(s ) will be left in the quark mixing matrix , namely the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "only a single nontrivial phase is left which turns out to explain all the measured cp - violation effects successfully @xcite .",
    "however , it is still necessary and attractive to study additional sources of cp - violation , which may help to understand the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe @xcite .    in the sm",
    ", there is no cp - violation in the scalar sector . in models with additional scalars",
    ", extra cp - violation may be introduced in the scalar sector @xcite .",
    "for example , in a minimal extension of sm @xcite , some kinds of two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) like lee model @xcite or georgi model @xcite , and weinberg model which contains three higgs doublets @xcite , etc . , there exists cp - violation in the scalar sector . in such models ,",
    "a higgs boson can be a cp - mixing state .",
    "as an example , two of the authors have studied the phenomenology of lee model which contains spontaneous cp - violation in the scalar sector in detail @xcite .",
    "these papers revealed the possible correlation between the lightness of higgs boson and the smallness of cp - violation based on spontaneous cp - violation mechanism which provides another important motivation to study cp - violation further in the scalar sector .    in 2012",
    ", a sm - like higgs boson was discovered by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite with its mass around 125 gev @xcite .",
    "its spin and cp properties have also been studied through the final state distributions of @xmath15 decay process with the conclusion that a pure @xmath16 state is favored and a pure @xmath17 state is excluded at over @xmath18 level @xcite . however , a cp - mixing state is still allowed @xcite because the contribution from pseudoscalar component is loop induced and thus highly suppressed .",
    "cp - violation beyond the sm may show several kinds of indirect effects .",
    "for example , it may contribute to the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of election or neutron @xcite which are stringently constrained experimentally @xcite ; it may contribute to meson mixing matrix element and thus a modification from sm prediction could occur @xcite ; or it may also contribute to the anomalous @xmath19 coupling vertex @xcite which could lead to a nontrivial cp - sensitive asymmetry in @xmath20 process @xcite .",
    "however , to study the exact sources of extra cp - violation , we need their direct effects . for example , a cp - mixing higgs boson could couple to a fermion through the effective interaction @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 may be of the same order . for @xmath24 , it is possible to test cp - violation effects in @xmath25 vertex at future @xmath26 or @xmath27 colliders @xcite using the final state distribution of @xmath28 decay process .",
    "similarly , for @xmath29 , the top polarization asymmetry in @xmath30 process is useful to test cp - violation effects in @xmath31 vertex @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the scalar sector itself and propose a _ model - independent _ method to test cp - violation effects in the scalar sector through the interaction between scalars and massive gauge bosons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in we",
    "describe our method and perform a simulation study at the cepc . in",
    "we apply this method to the weakly - coupled lee model . and",
    "in we give our conclusions and discussions .",
    "if more than one neutral scalars are discovered in the future , the tree level interaction between neutral scalars and massive gauge bosons could be written as @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the @xmath34 coupling constant , @xmath35 denotes the cosine of electro - weak angle @xmath36 , , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for any angle @xmath39 .",
    "] @xmath40 is the vacuum expected value for sm scalar field , and @xmath41 represents the @xmath42th scalar . for the first two terms , a nonzero tree - level @xmath43 vertex requires that @xmath41 must contain cp - even component ;",
    "while for the last term , a nonzero tree - level @xmath44 vertex requires that @xmath41 and @xmath45 must contain components with different cp - properties . if cp is a good symmetry , there must be some terms vanishing in ( [ hv ] ) ; on the other hand , if all @xmath46 and @xmath47 are nonzero , there must be cp - violation in the scalar sector .      for the minimal case ,",
    "two neutral scalars with non - degenerate masses are required to be discovered .",
    "cp - violation can be confirmed with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 all measured to be nonzero .",
    "it is natural to define @xmath51 which is a useful quantity to measure the cp - violation effect since @xmath52 is a sufficient condition for the existence of cp - violation in the scalar sector .",
    "is not a necessary condition for the existence of cp - violation in the scalar sector which means in some models , there may be cp - violation in the scalar sector with @xmath53 , see the discussions in the last section . ] as an example , in 2hdms , there are three neutral higgs bosons .",
    "we can use this idea to search for direct cp - violation effect once two of them are discovered .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows @xmath54 , and @xmath2 is just the product for all @xmath46 in 2hdm . that is an important quantity to measure cp - violation in the scalar sector @xcite .    at the lhc , the 125",
    "gev higgs boson @xmath55 has already been discovered and the direct @xmath56 vertices have been confirmed @xcite . if another higgs boson @xmath57 is discovered and it has tree level decay channels @xmath58 , it would strongly suggest cp - violation in the scalar sector which has already been discussed in @xcite . however , the @xmath59 measurements at lhc depend on not only @xmath60 and @xmath50 , but also a lot of other parameters which would affect on the production cross section or branching ratios .",
    "thus it is difficult to extract or constrain the value of @xmath2 from these measurements without model - dependent assumptions .    at future @xmath27 colliders , we can use three associated production processes , @xmath61 , to search for cp - violation in the scalar sector .",

    "generalizing this technique to @xmath75 process , with @xmath55 the 125 gev higgs boson and @xmath76 , the distribution of @xmath77 would show a narrow peak around @xmath78 and thus we can measure the @xmath79 inclusive cross section to extract the @xmath80 coupling @xmath50 in a model - independent way . using this method ,",

    "<S> we propose a _ model - independent _ method to test cp - violation in the scalar sector through measuring the inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 processes with the recoil mass technique , where @xmath1 stand for the 125 gev standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson and a new lighter scalar respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this method effectively measures a quantity @xmath2 proportional to the product of the three couplings of @xmath3 vertices . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath2 encodes a part of information about cp - violation in the scalar sector . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the signal and backgrounds for the processes mentioned above with @xmath4 at the circular electron - positron collider ( cepc ) with the integrated luminosity @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the discovery of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 processes at @xmath8 level will indicate an @xmath9 @xmath2 value which can be measured to @xmath10 precision . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to the weakly - coupled lee model in which cp - violation can be tested either before or after utilizing a  @xmath11 balance \" cut ( see for the definition ) . </S>",
    "<S> lastly we point out that @xmath12 is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for the existence of cp - violation in the scalar sector , namely @xmath13 does not imply cp conservation in the scalar sector .    </S>"
