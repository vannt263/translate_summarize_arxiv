    "there is increasing observational evidence that natural systems often show scaling in a statistical sense , coincident with non - gaussian ` heavy tailed ' statistics .",
    "complex systems approaches aim to understand these phenomena as universal , with a key quantitative prediction of theory being scaling exponents .",
    "importantly , the identification of universal scaling functions implies the ability to describe many different length and time scales as well as apparently disjoint physical phenomena with the same macroscopic scaling behaviour @xcite .",
    "one of the outstanding challenges in complex system science is then to find robust methods that ( i ) establish whether there is scaling and ( ii ) accurately determine the scaling exponents for statistical measures of series of data that are of large , but finite length .",
    "we seek to determine the scaling properties of probability distributions that are heavy - tailed .",
    "the scaling exponents can be determined through the scaling behaviour of the moments , usually characterised by computing structure functions .",
    "where the probability density is heavy tailed the moments and structure functions can depend strongly on extremal values , or outliers .",
    "once we insist that the data series is represented by a finite number of measurements , the values at which these outliers occur will always vary between one realisation and the next . from an operational point of view , that is , when the underlying behaviour is not known _ a priori _ , these outliers can potentially distort the scaling properties of the data and the values of scaling exponents extracted via the structure functions . in this paper",
    "we propose a generic method for excluding these outliers in a manner which does not distort the underlying scaling properties of the data .",
    "these outliers also contain information and we explore a method for extracting this .",
    "we will test these ideas on numerically generated lvy processes .",
    "there has been considerable interest in fractional kinetics as providing stochastic models for the data of candidate complex systems @xcite .",
    "lvy processes have been identified for example in biological systems ( foraging of albatrosses @xcite ) , financial markets ( s&p 500 @xcite ) and physical systems ( laser cooling and trapping @xcite ) .",
    "a robust method for determining the lvy exponent from finite sized data sets , where the statistics are not known _ a priori _ is thus important in its own right .",
    "the method that we propose here is however quite generic , with application to a wide class of systems that show scaling ; for example those that can be modelled by stochastic differential equations with scaling @xcite . in this wider context lvy processes , which have non - convergent higher order moments ,",
    "provide a particularly stringent test of our ideas .",
    "one can characterise fluctuations in a timeseries @xmath3 on a given time scale @xmath4 in terms of a differenced variable @xmath5 @xmath6 for time @xmath7 and interval @xmath4 , where the timeseries / stochastic process @xmath3 represents a particular realisation or set of observations of the system from which the @xmath8 s are generated .",
    "we consider the case where the @xmath5 satisfy the following scaling relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is some scale dilation factor ; @xmath11 indicates an equality in the statistical / distribution sense ; @xmath12 is some scaling function ( to be determined ) ; and we have dropped the time argument in the increments @xmath8 by assuming statistical stationarity .",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath13 are positive . the property in ( [ eq : eqn2 ] )",
    "is a generalized form of _ self - affinity , _ and in this sense @xmath3 is a _ self - affine _ field .",
    "self - affinity is a particular case of statistical self - similarity i.e. stochastic processes that exhibit the absence of characteristic scales @xcite .",
    "we can write the scaling transformations ( [ eq : eqn2 ] ) as @xmath14 where the primed variables represent scaled quantities .",
    "conservation of probability under change of variables implies that the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath8 , @xmath15 is related to the pdf of @xmath16 , @xmath17 by @xmath18 thus giving from ( [ eq : eqn3 ] ) @xmath19 the result ( [ eq : eqn4pt5 ] ) expresses the fact that the stochastic process @xmath3 is statistically self - similar i.e. that a given process on scale @xmath20 ( and thus @xmath16 ) maps onto another process based on a different scale @xmath4 ( and @xmath8 ) by the scaling transformation in ( [ eq : eqn3 ] ) ; and that the pdfs of both these processes are related by ( [ eq : eqn4pt5 ] ) .",
    "we can go further and reduce the expression ( [ eq : eqn4pt5 ] ) to a function of one variable .",
    "since the dilation factor @xmath10 is arbitrary we choose @xmath21 , which gives the important result @xmath22 and shows that any pdf @xmath23 of increments @xmath8 characterised by a time increment @xmath4 may be collapsed onto a single unique pdf @xmath24 of rescaled increments @xmath25 and time increment @xmath26 , by the above scaling transformation .",
    "identification of this unique _ scaling function _ and the ensuing collapse is a clearer method of discriminating between different ( universality ) scaling classes than simply identifying the scaling exponents by themselves @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the scaling as defined by the structure functions .",
    "the generalised structure functions of order @xmath27 are simply defined as @xmath28 the analysis which follows is also valid for the moments ; however , structure functions are typically calculated for data .",
    "this avoids the result that odd order moments of symmetric pdfs are zero so that as a consequence , in a physical system , they would be dominated by experimental error . using the transformation ( [ eq : eqn5 ] ) ,",
    "the scaling of the structure functions is : @xmath29 this formalism encompasses a general class of self - affine systems in the sense that it is not restricted to the well - studied case of mono - exponent scaling .",
    "the above result ( [ eq : eqn5pt75 ] ) holds provided that the pdf @xmath23 is defined for all @xmath8 .",
    "however , for finite data sets this is not the case . in this situation",
    "we have the integral ( [ eq : eqn5pt5 ] ) defined for the interval @xmath30 $ ] where the @xmath31 are defined in some sense by the largest events measured in the data set .",
    "the values of @xmath31 will depend on the time scale @xmath4 and the sample size @xmath32 ( which will be held constant ) .",
    "thus the structure functions for the finite data set are @xmath33 manipulating this in a similar way to ( [ eq : eqn5pt75 ] ) results in the following scaling relation @xmath34 if we assume that the values @xmath31 scale with @xmath4 in the same way as the increments @xmath8 in ( [ eq : eqn3 ] ) , then ( [ eq : eqn5pt95 ] ) becomes : @xmath35    we will consider the case of self - affine scaling where the scaling function @xmath12 takes the form of a mono - scaling power law @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is known as the _ hurst _ exponent . equation ( [ eq : eqn5 ] ) then becomes @xmath38 and ( [ eq : eqn5pt75 ] ) becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 for this self - affine case . a log - log plot of @xmath41 vs. @xmath4 for various orders @xmath27 reveals scaling if present , and the slope of such a plot determines the exponents @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "one then verifies that @xmath40 by plotting @xmath42 as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain a good estimate of the scaling properties of ( [ eq : eqn5pt5 ] ) , the structure functions at @xmath43 , via ( [ eq : eqn5pt97 ] ) for @xmath32 large but finite .",
    "however , we can anticipate that simply setting the limits @xmath31 of the integral ( [ eq : eqn5pt9 ] ) to the largest values found in a given realisation of the data , will give a scaling behaviour of ( [ eq : eqn5pt97 ] ) which can differ substantially from that of ( [ eq : eqn5pt85 ] ) .",
    "this problem arises since the @xmath8 values of the extremal points fluctuate between one realisation and the next , and these fluctuations are more significant in heavy tailed distributions .",
    "this in turn will strongly modify the integral .",
    "we will therefore explore the possibility of choosing a range for the integral ( [ eq : eqn5pt9 ] ) based on the scaling property of the data itself , by systematically excluding the most extreme outlying points .",
    "this has the added advantage of not requiring _ a priori _ information about the system .",
    "we stress that as our aim is to extract scaling exponents , we do not attempt to estimate the value of the moments or structure functions .",
    "thus we will not compute an estimate of the integral ( [ eq : eqn5pt5 ] ) _ per se _ , rather we will examine methods for quantifying its dependence on the dilation factor @xmath10 ( or equivalently @xmath4 ) .",
    "hence , our method can be applied to lvy processes  where the moments are not defined , but where the pdf has scaling .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first introduce the lvy process that we will use to obtain ( [ eq : eqn5pt9 ] ) and briefly survey results pertaining to its asymptotic behaviour .",
    "we then discuss the effects of finite sized data sets and demonstrate the effect of removing outliers on the scaling behaviour of the lvy process .",
    "we then explore the behaviour of these outliers .",
    "many stochastic processes exhibit self - affine scaling and are characterised by ` broad tails ' described by power - laws in their pdfs",
    ". some possible mechanisms by which these power laws occur are discussed in @xcite .",
    "this general class of stochastic processes can be described in the context of so - called _",
    "@xmath0-stable lvy processes _ @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our attention to symmetric @xmath0-stable processes .",
    "the pdfs @xmath44 of the increments @xmath8 of these processes are defined through the fourier transform of their characteristic function @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the characteristic scales of the process and describe the width of the distribution ; and @xmath48 $ ] parameterises the stability of the distribution ; @xmath0 can be heuristically seen as an indication of the variability of the increments of such processes ( also known as _ lvy flights _ ) . in this paper",
    "we will take @xmath49 and will consequently reduce the notation @xmath44 to @xmath50 .",
    "the form and convention of the parameters in equation ( [ eq : eqn6 ] ) are similar to that presented in @xcite ; for a more rigorous discussion of the mathematical properties of such processes readers are referred to @xcite .",
    "from ( [ eq : eqn6 ] ) it follows that the scaling properties of @xmath50 are @xmath51 from which the hurst exponent of symmetric @xmath0-stable processes is @xmath52 , by comparison with ( [ eq:5pt98 ] ) .",

    ". it immediately follows that these power - law tails ensure that for the @xmath58 moment to exist , @xmath59 .",
    "hence the process has no variance defined for @xmath60 , and in the cases where @xmath61 the process will also have no mean defined i.e. both these quantities and the other higher order moments are infinite .",
    "a generalized version of the central limit theorem ( clt ) @xcite ensures that the sum of all independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables with no finite variance that have distributions with power law tails that go asymptotically as @xmath62 ( @xmath48 $ ] ) , will converge to a lvy distribution of the same index @xmath0 . in practice , however , we will always obtain a finite mean and variance from a finite length timeseries .",
    "we will now consider in detail the procedure for extracting the scaling exponents , @xmath42 , from the structure functions in ( [ eq : eqn5pt85 ] ) .",
    "this centres on first computing @xmath63 and the gradients @xmath42 of log - log plots of @xmath63 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "if the process is self - affine ( @xmath40 ) we should obtain a straight line on a plot of @xmath42 vs. @xmath27 from which we can measure the gradient and obtain the hurst exponent , @xmath37 .",
    "note that the @xmath42 for several @xmath27 are needed to determine @xmath37 uniquely @xcite .",
    "however , finite sample sizes result in pseudo multi - affine behaviour .",
    "as we will show , the primary reason for this anomalous behaviour is due to the large scatter in the outlying events of the tails of the distribution . in the case of lvy - like processes",
    "this scaling bias shows up as a saturation / roll - over on the @xmath42 plots at @xmath64 .",
    "a )    b )    this can be seen in figure [ cap : levyrollover ] which illustrates both the methodology of extracting scaling exponents from structure function plots , and this finite sample size saturation effect in a lvy process of index @xmath54 .",
    "this saturation effect is well - known and an explanation for it can be found in the work by schmitt _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and chechkin and gonchar @xcite",
    ". we will now establish the scaling properties of these extremal events .",
    "we need to emphasise , however , that in contrast to @xcite we will propose a method for estimating the integral in ( [ eq : eqn5pt5 ] ) such that the scaling in ( [ eq : eqn5pt85 ] ) is recovered for _ all _ @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the situation where we have many realisations , that is many data series of size @xmath32 obtained from the same process .",
    "each of these realisations will have extremal points @xmath65 of their respective pdf .",
    "we know the properties of @xmath66 , the ensemble average of the @xmath65 over the realisations , since it will fall on the lvy asymptotic distribution ( [ eq : eqn8 ] ) .",
    "we will use a simple example of extreme value theory , evt , ( see @xcite ) to obtain an estimate of the largest event in a sample of @xmath32 i.i.d .",
    "measurements of a random variable @xmath67 .",
    "an approximation to the probability to see an event that occurs only once can be made by realising that an event with probability @xmath23 occurs typically @xmath68 times .",
    "therefore , the rarest event in a sample of @xmath32 measurements , which occurs typically only once can be seen to be described by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the probability of observing an event greater than or equal to @xmath66 ; thus @xmath71 we can generalise this to the @xmath72 largest event : @xmath73 for the case of the lvy - like process , within the limits of the integral in @xmath74 the main contribution is from the tail and thus we can use ( [ eq : eqn8 ] ) and estimate @xmath74 to be @xmath75 evaluating the integral and equating with ( [ eq : eqn10 ] ) gives the following result for the scaling behaviour of the @xmath72 largest event @xmath76    a more detailed account would be to attempt to specify approximately the full pdf of the @xmath72 largest event amongst @xmath32 i.i.d .",

    ", we obtain @xmath84 if one was to set @xmath85 the value of @xmath86 would correspond to the median value of the @xmath72 largest event . to obtain the modal value of @xmath87 , we optimise for the maximum by differentiating ( [ eq : eqn14 ] ) and setting it to zero .",
    "this gives us the following solution for the modal value of @xmath87 @xmath88    by comparing these expressions one can see that although the approximation of @xmath87 becomes more refined , the scaling with @xmath4 is still that of ( [ eq : eqn12 ] ) .",
    "thus we will proceed using the simplest expression ( [ eq : eqn12 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we will be working with a varying fraction @xmath89 rather than varying @xmath90 or @xmath32 separately .",
    "importantly , since we are concerned primarily with the scaling with respect to @xmath4 we will write @xmath87 more informatively as @xmath91 and thus adding to our scaling relations @xmath92 as expected from equation ( [ eq : eqn2 ] ) is not needed here as @xmath87 is a statistical quantity . ] .",
    "we emphasise that this is the scaling of @xmath87 ; the average over the @xmath72 largest events of a large number of realisations ( timeseries ) . in practice we will have a single realisation and thus one value of @xmath86 which will fluctuate about this ensemble averaged @xmath87 .",
    "the behaviour ( [ eq : eqn17 ] ) refers to the property that any point in the curve @xmath15 scales as ( [ eq : eqn5 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqn3 ] ) .",

    "as with any power - law tailed pdf it has infinite variance for @xmath60 . in the context of evt , equation ( [ eq : eqn22 ] ) is not surprising as it is simply an extreme value distribution of type ii i.e. the pdf from a frchet distribution .",
    "the extreme value distributions can be seen as the large event statistics equivalent to stable distributions ( i.e. gaussian and lvy ) .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for a further discussion of evt and extreme value distributions .    a plot of the pdf ( [ eq : eqn22 ] )",
    "is given in figure [ cap : evtpdf ] for various values of @xmath104 and for @xmath106 . from figure [ cap : evtpdf ]",
    "we see that as the value of @xmath104 increases , the pdf of @xmath86 broadens .",
    "importantly , the pdf of @xmath86 ( [ eq : eqn22 ] ) has an infinite variance and thus has more frequently occuring extreme values of @xmath86 away from @xmath87 .",
    "thus from figure [ cap : evtpdf ] and ( [ eq : eqn23 ] ) we see that the scatter in the @xmath86 about the average @xmath87 increases with @xmath32 and decreases with @xmath89 .",
    "we now present a method to ` condition ' data so that the scaling behaviour ( [ eq : eqn5pt85 ] ) emerges from the structure functions obtained for a finite data series . from an operational point of view , that is , when attempting to determine an ( unknown ) exponent from a finite length timeseries , our aim is to recover ( [ eq : eqn5pt85 ] ) for as many orders @xmath27 as feasible .",
    "this method involves excluding a fraction @xmath89 of the largest events from the data set such that our post - exclusion tails are now sufficiently resolved and populated .",
    "although there is some literature on the removal of extreme outliers in data , the first time it was clearly done in the scaling context was by veltri _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite .",
    "they calculated structure functions via the use of a haar wavelet transform and conditioned their data by separating the wavelet coefficients into two classes : the majority of coefficients which characterise the `` quietly turbulent flow '' ; and the coefficients which characterise the rare intermittent events corresponding to coherent structures .",
    "the partition between these two classes was a wavelet coefficient based upon a multiple @xmath107 of the square root of the second moment of the coefficents . the easiest way to view",
    "this is by looking at the more recent works of chapman _ et .",
    "@xcite ( and refs therein ) who employed an equivalent technique but did not use wavelet transforms to calculate the structure functions . along with their solar wind turbulence data",
    ", the latter authors also studied some toy cases of fractional brownian motion and a lvy process of @xmath108 .",
    "this conditioning can be succinctly written as the approximation @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 is the standard deviation and @xmath112 is some constant .",
    "this corresponds to _ clipping _ the wings of the distribution to exclude the very large unresolved events . both these studies @xcite showed that removing a relatively few percentage of points is sufficient to regain the scaling",
    ". however , the disadvantage of these schemes is that the measure used to exclude the extreme events is the standard deviation , @xmath113 , of the _ raw _ data which must be calculated _ a priori _ and we have already seen in the above analysis that @xmath64 ( and thus @xmath113 ) is poorly represented in the unconditioned data .",
    "a better estimate is to condition the data based on the actual extreme events i.e. by excluding a certain negligible fraction of the data outliers .",
    "a brief mention should be made of the work by jespersen _ et .",
    "they studied the behaviour of lvy flights in external force fields and used a form of conditioning for obtaining a good statistical ensemble in the power - law tail range of a lvy process .",
    "their conditioning , however , assumes _ a priori _ knowledge of the distribution and its scaling behaviour , and is thus not congruent to the applications to which this paper aims ; this being single finite size natural timeseries .    to summarise , our procedure will be to :    1 .",
    "choose limits of the integral in ( [ eq : eqn24 ] ) such that the scaling ( [ eq : eqn5pt85 ] ) is recovered  using a method that does not require _ a priori _ knowledge of the pdf @xmath15 to specify those limits .",
    "2 .   this procedure will exclude the most outlying points ( @xmath114% ) .",
    "these outliers contain some physics of the system .",
    "they may or may not share the scaling ( [ eq:5pt98 ] ) with the core of the pdf @xmath15 , instead showing finite size scaling ( exponential roll - off ) or other dynamics . therefore we will also test the outliers for the property ( [ eq : eqn17 ] ) .",
    "we now test these ideas with a numerically generated lvy process .",
    "the increments @xmath8 of the lvy process of index @xmath0 were generated by using the following algorithm @xcite @xmath115}{v}\\right)^{(1-\\alpha)/\\alpha}\\ , \\label{eq : eqn25}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 $ ] is a uniformly distributed random variable and @xmath117 is an exponentially distributed random variable with unit mean .",

    "this timeseries was then differenced at various @xmath4 as in ( [ eq : eqn1 ] ) using an overlapping window ; appropriate here since the data increments are uncorrelated .",
    "structure functions of the increments @xmath118 , are then calculated at different orders @xmath27 and at different values of @xmath4 .",

    "convergence is achieved at @xmath121 for @xmath108 and @xmath122 for @xmath119 ; which correspond to the largest event being @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "these values lie in the region given by ( [ eq : eqn8 ] ) , as the asymptotic tail region of the pdf is valid for @xmath125 here .",
    "it is also instructive to investigate the effects of variations in sample size @xmath32 on the rates of convergence .",
    "figure [ cap : gstrfvarn ] illustrates these effects in the form of @xmath42 vs. @xmath27 plots for sizes @xmath126 and @xmath127 for a lvy process of index @xmath119 . recall that decreasing the sample size would result in further undersampling and thus poor statistics in the tails of the pdf",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure [ cap : gstrfvarn ] ( a ) where we see a slow convergence to the line @xmath128 which is achieved after @xmath129% of the data is excluded .",
    "the converse of this is shown in figure [ cap : gstrfvarn ] ( b ) where increasing the sample size by a factor of @xmath130 results in a very rapid convergence to scaling which is reached after only @xmath131% of the data is excluded .",

    "the anticipated scaling ( [ eq : eqn17 ] ) appears at a value of @xmath89 corresponding to a few percent .",

    "the scaling with @xmath89 is again as expected from ( [ eq : eqn12])([eq : eqn16 ] ) , and the rank order plots also highlight scatter of individual realisations of @xmath86 from the ensemble average . in figure",

    "we are concerned with the situation of observations of natural systems , or of experiments , where the underlying pdf is not known _ a priori _ and where one inevitably has a finite length series of data .",
    "hence we have proposed a technique that does not require _ a priori _ knowledge of the underlying process and that has consistency checks .",
    "we have shown that ` conditioning ' the data by progressively excluding the outliers , or extremal points , when computing the scaling exponents from the structure functions , recovers the underlying scaling of a self - affine process up to large order . for large datasets of a lvy process",
    "this corresponds to removing 0.1 - 1% of the data .",
    "the conditioned structure functions then provide a straightforward method for determining the self - affine scaling exponent , in this case the lvy index @xmath0 , directly from the slope of a plot of the exponents versus moment order .",
    "this method offers two consistency checks .",
    "the first of these is that for a self - affine process , as we progressively remove more outliers we expect that the exponents obtained from the structure functions should converge on values which then do not vary . practically speaking , one would plot the exponents as a function of the location of the last outlier excluded and expect a plateau that extended deep into the tail of the pdf .",
    "a second check is obtained by examining the scaling properties of these discarded outliers .",
    "importantly , the above analysis assumes that we have some relatively good statistics  in practice the high variability of the lvy process due to the fat tails will always result in some lone extreme points with a finite probability of occurence , resulting in anomalous scaling exponents .",
    "this implies that we",
    "_ always _ need some way of cleaning or conditioning the data to recover the scaling behaviour .",
    "these lone points can have a drastic effect since in a lvy - like process the largest value of a set of increments of a timeseries can be of the order of the total sum @xcite . coupled with this",
    "we have that the tails of a distribution are described by the higher order moments ( structure functions here ) .",
    "if the statistics of the tail are not well resolved then these moments will also give anomalous values of @xmath42 ."
