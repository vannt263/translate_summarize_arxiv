    "<S> mathieu modes can be used to entangle the internal and center of mass involved states , and weber beams suppress this kind of transitions unless they have a significant component of odd modes . however , </S>",
    "<S> if a recoil effect of the transition with an adequate symmetry is allowed , the global transition rate ( center of mass and internal motion ) can also be enhanced using weber modes . the global analysis presented reinforces the idea that a better control of the transitions between internal atomic states requires both a proper control of the available states of the atomic center of mass , and shaping of the background electromagnetic field . </S>"
