    "trapped dilute cold atomic gases are one of the most exciting fields in condensed matter physics.@xcite an important recent development in this area is the application of feshbach resonances .",
    "a feshbach resonance in the scattering amplitude of two atoms occurs when the total energy of the atoms is close to the energy of a molecular state that is weakly coupled to the atomic continuum .",
    "especially , the energy difference between the molecular state and the two - atom continuum , known as the detuning @xmath0 , can be experimentally tuned by means of a magnetic field .",
    "therefore , by sweeping the magnetic field from positive to negative detuning through the feshbach resonance , it is actually possible to form molecules in the atomic gas.@xcite in fact , recently , it has been possible to create a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of molecules in an atomic fermi gas with a feshbach resonance.@xcite this offers the opportunity for observing a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) transition in a dilute fermi gas .    in the present paper",
    ", we study an analogous situation by varying @xmath0 in an atomic bose gas with a feshbach resonance .",
    "two recent works@xcite have shown that by varying @xmath0 there is a true quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in an atomic bose gas , in contrast to the case of an atomic fermi gas where a smooth bec - bcs crossover exists as one changes @xmath0 .",
    "an argument to understand this has been given in ref . .",
    "we recapitulate it in the following to fix our notation .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing a dilute atomic gas with a feshbach resonance can be written as @xmath1 with @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation operators of atoms and molecules , respectively . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass of the atom and that of the molecule , respectively . in the path integral",
    "formula , @xmath4 is an ordinary number . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath3 is an ordinary number for the atomic bose gas , while it is a grassmann number for the atomic fermi gas .",
    "( for the atomic fermi gas , @xmath3 contains the indices for hyperfine spins and should be understood as a spinor . ) the lagrangian @xmath7 [ eq .",
    "( [ feshbact1 ] ) ] has a u(@xmath8 ) symmetry .",
    "that is , it is invariant against the u(@xmath8 ) transformation @xmath9 for an atomic bose gas , due to the @xmath10 term , a nonzero value of @xmath11 ( atomic bec ) must lead to a nonzero value of @xmath12 ( molecular bec ) .",
    "however , the reverse is not true .",
    "that is , it is possible for the gas to contain only a molecular bec . in the case with both atomic bec and molecular bec , the u(@xmath8 ) symmetry of @xmath7",
    "is completely broken .",
    "but for the case with only molecular bec there is a residual z@xmath13 symmetry .",
    "that is , the effective lagrangian in this case is invariant against the z@xmath13 transformation : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the above analysis indicates that at low temperature the atomic bose gas with a feshbach resonance has two thermodynamically distinct phases : the  atomic superfluid \" ( asf ) phase with both atomic bec and molecular bec , and the  molecular superfluid \" ( msf ) phase with molecular bec only .",
    "for an atomic fermi gas , due to the @xmath10 term , a nonzero value of @xmath16 must be accompanied with a nonvanishing value of @xmath12 and vice versa .",
    "therefore , the bcs region has the same symmetry as the bec region , and only a crossover occurs .    based on the above observation , the msf phase is distinct from the asf phase by a z@xmath13 symmetry .",
    "thus , the phase transition between the two phases is characterized by an ising ( z@xmath13 ) order parameter .",
    "naively , one may expect that this qpt is of second order and belongs to the four - dimensional ( @xmath17 ) ising universality class at zero temperature and the three - dimensional ( @xmath18 ) ising universality class at finite temperature .",
    "however , there is a gapless excitation in the msf phase , which is the goldstone mode associated with the molecular bec .",
    "an additional gapless excitation may result in severe ir divergences and modify the critical behavior . therefore , a proper theory describing the qpt should consist of the ising order parameter as well as the goldstone mode .",
    "a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis indicates that the coupling between the ising order parameter and the goldstone mode will drive the zero - temperature phase transition to become weakly first order@xcite through the colemann - weinberg mechanism.@xcite the question in which we are interested here is the nature of this phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "we study this problem in terms of the rg .",
    "our main results are shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , which are valid at the temperature much lower than the amplitude fluctuations in the molecular bec . at low temperature where the quantum fluctuations dominate the low - energy physics ,",
    "the phase transition between the msf and asf phases is of weakly first order .",
    "when the thermal fluctuations become important , the effects of the coupling between the ising order parameter and the goldstone mode are suppressed and the transition becomes a second - order one belonging to the @xmath18 ising universality class .",
    "thus , a tricritical point must exist on the phase boundary to separate these two kinds of phase transition .    , where @xmath19 represents the transition temperature between the normal bose gas and the superfluid phase .",
    "the dotted line denotes the crossover from low temperature to high temperature regimes .",

    "<S> we study the quantum phase transition in an atomic bose gas near a feshbach resonance in terms of the renormalization group . </S>",
    "<S> this quantum phase transition is characterized by an ising order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the low temperature regime where the quantum fluctuations dominate the low - energy physics this phase transition is of first order because of the coupling between the ising order parameter and the goldstone mode existing in the bosonic superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the thermal fluctuations become important , the phase transition turns into the second order one , which belongs to the three - dimensional ising universality class . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the damping rate of the collective mode in the phase with only a molecular bose - einstein condensate near the second - order transition line , which can serve as an experimental signature of the second - order transition . </S>"
