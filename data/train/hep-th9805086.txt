    "<S> as argued by witten on the basis of m - theory , qcd strings can end on domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> we present an explanation of this effect in the framework of effective field theories for the polyakov loop and the gluino condensate in @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the domain walls separating confined phases with different values of the gluino condensate are completely wet by a layer of deconfined phase at the high - temperature phase transition . as a consequence , even at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the polyakov loop has a non - vanishing expectation value on the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> thus , close to the wall , the free energy of a static quark is finite and the string emanating from it can end on the wall .    </S>",
    "<S> addtoresetequationsection    recently , witten has argued that qcd strings can end on domain walls @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect follows from a calculation in m - theory , where domain walls are represented by d - branes on which strings can end . </S>",
    "<S> witten s argument applies to a theory in the universality class of @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd . in this theory , a @xmath1 chiral symmetry  an unbroken remnant of the anomalous @xmath2 symmetry </S>",
    "<S>  is spontaneously broken at low temperatures by a non - zero value of the gluino condensate @xmath3 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> there are three distinct confined phases , characterized by three different values of @xmath3 , which are related by @xmath1 transformations . regions of space filled with different confined phases are separated by domain walls . passing from one region to another through a domain wall , the qcd vacuum angle @xmath4 changes by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is characteristic of axionic domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> witten s string theory arguments imply that a qcd string emanating from a static quark can end on such a wall . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of domain walls in supersymmetric theories have been investigated in great detail by shifman and collaborators @xcite and topological defects ending on other defects have been studied in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative explanation of why strings can end on axionic domain walls has been given by rey @xcite in the framework of field theory . </S>",
    "<S> his explanation is based on t hooft s picture of oblique confinement @xcite , which at @xmath6 is due to monopole condensation . at @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> the monopoles turn into color - electrically charged dyons @xcite and confinement is due to condensation of dyons . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a confined - confined domain wall separates regions of monopole and dyon condensates . </S>",
    "<S> when a dyon passes through the domain wall , it turns into a monopole and leaves its color charge at the wall . </S>",
    "<S> if the walls can carry a color charge , a qcd string can end there . </S>",
    "<S> a more quantitative description of this effect in an axion toy model has been given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while rey s picture applies to the axion toy model , we think that it does not provide a correct field theoretic explanation of witten s m - theory calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd , strings can end on the walls not because the walls are charged , but because they can transport flux to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> a similar scenario involving a non - abelian coulomb phase was discussed qualitatively in @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we provide the first quantitative field theoretic explanation for why strings can end on walls for models in the universality class of @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd , i.e. for the same class of models to which witten s m - theory calculation applies </S>",
    "<S> . often , topological defects , which result from spontaneous symmetry breaking , have the phase of unbroken symmetry at their cores . </S>",
    "<S> for example , magnetic monopoles have symmetric vacuum at their centers . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , at the core of axionic cosmic strings the @xmath8 peccei - quinn symmetry is restored . </S>",
    "<S> witten has constructed a model in which @xmath8 symmetry restoration leads to breaking of the @xmath9 gauge group of electromagnetism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , axionic strings in this model become superconducting . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed similarly for domain walls by constructing an effective field theory , in which @xmath1 restoration implies breaking of the @xmath10 center symmetry of the @xmath11 gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> then the high - temperature deconfined phase appears at the center of the domain wall , i.e. the polyakov loop  as the order parameter for @xmath10 breaking  has a non - zero expectation value there . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a static quark has a finite free energy close to the wall and its string can end there .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a new phase appearing at a domain wall separating two bulk phases is well - known in condensed matter physics as complete wetting . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the interface between the human eye and the surrounding air is completely wet by a film of tears . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the eye - air solid - gas interface splits into a solid - liquid and a liquid - gas interface . </S>",
    "<S> the alternative is incomplete wetting </S>",
    "<S> . then droplets of liquid form at the solid - gas interface , but no complete wetting film appears . </S>",
    "<S> complete wetting is known to appear at the deconfinement phase transition of the @xmath12 non - supersymmetric @xmath11 yang - mills theory @xcite . in that case , the @xmath10 center symmetry is spontaneously broken at high temperatures , giving rise to three distinct deconfined phases , which are distinguished by different values of the polyakov loop . when a deconfined - deconfined domain wall is cooled down to the phase transition , the low - temperature confined phase appears as a complete wetting layer that splits the deconfined - deconfined domain wall into a pair of confined - deconfined interfaces . in @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetric qcd , there are three distinct confined phases . in this paper , we show that complete wetting also arises when a confined - confined domain wall is heated up to the phase transition . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> one of the three deconfined phases forms a complete wetting layer such that the polyakov loop is non - zero at the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> it continues to be non - zero even below the phase transition temperature . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of a static quark located at the wall is finite . </S>",
    "<S> when the quark is displaced from the wall , its free energy increases linearly with the distance . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the quark is confined to the wall and the string emanating from it ends there .    </S>",
    "<S> complete wetting is a universal phenomenon of interfaces at first order phase transitions . in the case of @xmath12 non - supersymmetric @xmath11 yang - mills theory </S>",
    "<S> the universal aspects of the interface dynamics are captured by a 3-d effective action @xcite , @xmath13 = \\int d^3 x \\ [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\vec \\nabla \\phi^ * \\cdot \\vec \\nabla \\phi + v(\\phi)],\\ ] ] for the polyakov loop @xmath14 , which is a gauge invariant complex scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> its expectation value @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the temperature , measures the free energy @xmath17 of a static quark . in the confined phase , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 diverges and @xmath18 vanishes , while in the deconfined phase , @xmath17 is finite and @xmath18 is non - zero . under </S>",
    "<S> topologically non - trivial gauge transformations , which are periodic in euclidean time up to a center element @xmath19 , the polyakov loop changes into @xmath20 . hence </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath10 symmetry is spontaneously broken in the deconfined phase . </S>",
    "<S> under charge conjugation , the polyakov loop is replaced by its complex conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential @xmath21 is restricted by @xmath10 and charge conjugation symmetry , i.e. @xmath22 the most general quartic potential consistent with these symmetries takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> one can restrict oneself to quartic potentials because they are sufficient to explore the universal features of the interface dynamics . at the deconfinement phase transition temperature ( corresponding to @xmath25 ) , the above potential has four degenerate minima , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 representing the three deconfined phases and @xmath29 representing the confined phase . in ref.@xcite , it was shown that a deconfined - deconfined domain wall is completely wet by the confined phase and the corresponding critical exponents were determined analytically .    in @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetric qcd the @xmath1 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the confined phase . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding order parameter is the complex valued gluino condensate @xmath30 . under chiral transformations @xmath31 , the gluino condensate transforms into @xmath32 and under charge conjugation it also gets replaced by its complex conjugate . at high temperatures , one expects chiral symmetry to be restored and  as in the non - supersymmetric theory  the @xmath10 center symmetry to be spontaneously broken due to deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the effective action describing the interface dynamics now depends on both order parameters @xmath33 and @xmath3 , such that @xmath34 = \\int d^3 x \\ [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\vec \\nabla \\phi^ * \\cdot \\vec \\nabla   \\phi + \\frac{1}{2 } \\vec \\nabla \\chi^ * \\cdot \\vec \\nabla \\chi + v(\\phi,\\chi)].\\ ] ] the most general quartic potential consistent with @xmath10 , @xmath1 and charge conjugation now takes the form @xmath35 first , we assume that deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration occur at the same temperature and that the phase transition is first order </S>",
    "<S> . then , three chirally broken confined phases coexist with three distinct chirally symmetric deconfined phases . </S>",
    "<S> the three deconfined phases have @xmath36 , @xmath27 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while the three confined phases are characterized by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition temperature corresponds to a choice of parameters @xmath43 such that all six phases @xmath44 , @xmath45 represent degenerate absolute minima of @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now look for solutions of the classical equations of motion , representing planar domain walls , i.e. @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the coordinate perpendicular to the wall . the equations of motion then take the form @xmath50    figure 1 shows a numerical solution of these equations for a domain wall separating two confined phases of type @xmath51 and @xmath52 , i.e. with boundary conditions @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1a corresponds to a temperature deep in the confined phase . </S>",
    "<S> still , at the domain wall the polyakov loop is non - zero , i.e. the center of the domain wall shows characteristic features of the deconfined phase . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1b corresponds to a temperature very close to the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> then the confined - confined domain wall splits into two confined - deconfined interfaces and the deconfined phase forms a complete wetting layer between them . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of figure 1 have deconfined phase of type @xmath57 at their centers . due to the @xmath10 symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , there are related solutions with deconfined phase of types @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    for the special values @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath63 one can find an analytic solution for a confined - deconfined interface . </S>",
    "<S> combining two of these solutions to a confined - confined interface , one obtains @xmath64 , \\   </S>",
    "<S> \\phi_2(z ) = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\chi_1(z)&=&- \\frac{1}{4 } \\chi_0 [ 2 + \\tanh\\alpha(z - z_0 ) - \\tanh\\alpha(z+z_0 ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\chi_2(z)&=&\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4 } \\chi_0 [ \\tanh\\alpha(z - z_0 ) +   \\tanh\\alpha(z+z_0)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath60 , the critical temperature corresponds to @xmath68 . near criticality , where @xmath69 is small , the above solution is valid up to order @xmath70 , while now @xmath61 and @xmath62 are satisfied to order @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the deconfined complete wetting layer , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant , grows logarithmically as we approach the phase transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is the expected critical behavior for interfaces with short - range interactions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting if complete wetting could be studied in the framework of m - theory . </S>",
    "<S> if so , it should correspond to the unbinding of a pair of d - branes , which are tightly bound in the low - temperature phase .    </S>",
    "<S> now we wish to explain why the appearance of the deconfined phase at the center of the domain wall allows a qcd string to end there . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that an expectation value @xmath74 implies that the free energy of a static quark is finite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the solution of figure 1 containing deconfined phase of type ( 1 ) has @xmath75 , such that a static quark located at the center of the wall has finite free energy . </S>",
    "<S> as one moves away from the wall , the polyakov loop decreases as @xmath76 consequently , as the static quark is displaced from the wall , its free energy @xmath77 increases linearly with the distance @xmath49 from the center , i.e. the quark is confined to the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the string emanating from the static quark ends on the wall and has a tension @xmath78 still , there are the other domain wall solutions ( related to the one from above by @xmath10 transformations ) , which contain deconfined phase of types ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one could argue that , after path integration over all domain wall configurations , one obtains @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not true . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the wetting layer at the center of a confined - confined domain wall is described by a two - dimensional field theory with a spontaneously broken @xmath10 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , deconfined phase of one definite type spontaneously appears at the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> this argument does not apply to an interface of finite area , e.g. to a bubble wall enclosing a finite volume of confined phase of type ( 5 ) in a universe filled with confined phase of type ( 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , due to quantum tunneling the deconfined wetting layer at the surface of such a bubble would change from type ( 1 ) to types ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . as a consequence , @xmath79 , such that a qcd string can not end at the bubble wall . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is consistent with the @xmath10 gauss law applied to the compact surface of the bubble . </S>",
    "<S> color flux entering the bubble through a string must exit it somewhere else and then go to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the static quark at the origin of the string has infinite free energy and is confined in the usual sense . </S>",
    "<S> the deconfined wetting layer of an infinite domain wall , on the other hand , can transport flux to infinity at a finite free energy cost . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a static quark at a finite distance from the wall has a finite free energy and the string emanating from it can end on the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the above arguments imply that a qcd string can also end at a confined - deconfined interface at the high - temperature phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible even in non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we now understand that qcd strings can end on a confined - confined domain wall provided it is completely wet by deconfined phase . </S>",
    "<S> so far we have assumed that , above the phase transition , confinement is lost and simultaneously chiral symmetry is restored . in that case , indeed there is complete wetting . </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider two alternative scenarios for the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> first , we assume that chiral symmetry is still restored at temperatures above the phase transition , but that the theory remains confining . in that case , </S>",
    "<S> complete wetting still occurs , but now the wetting layer consists of chirally symmetric confined phase , which has @xmath80 . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> a qcd string could not end on the wall . </S>",
    "<S> next , we assume that , above the phase transition , the theory is deconfined , but that chiral symmetry remains broken , such that there are nine high - temperature phases . assuming that the gluino condensate does not vary drastically across the transition </S>",
    "<S> , one can show that complete wetting then does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> hence , again @xmath80 at the center of the domain wall and a qcd string could not end there . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that a confined - confined domain wall could still be incompletely wet , i.e. droplets of deconfined phase could appear at the wall . even in that case , a qcd string can not end at a droplet . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a complete wetting layer , a droplet has a finite volume . </S>",
    "<S> hence , due to quantum tunneling a deconfined droplet of type ( 1 ) will turn into one of types ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the average polyakov loop vanishes for these configurations , and a static quark has infinite free energy even close to the wall . </S>",
    "<S> given that qcd strings can end on the walls , as explained by witten , we conclude that the two alternative scenarios for the phase transition can be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , witten s m - theory arguments in combination with our results for complete wetting suggest that @xmath0 supersymmetric qcd has a high - temperature phase transition in which simultaneously confinement is lost and chiral symmetry is restored .    in conclusion , we have investigated @xmath81 symmetric effective theories for the polyakov loop and the gluino condensate . due to complete wetting , deconfined phase appears at a confined - confined domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> thus , close to the wall a static quark has a finite free energy and its string can end there . </S>",
    "<S> this is possible only when the wall is infinitely extended , because only then it can transport the quark s color flux to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> hence , without reference to m - theory , we can understand why a qcd string can end on the wall . </S>"
