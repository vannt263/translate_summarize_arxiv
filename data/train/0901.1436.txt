    "precise and accurate measurements of the position , proper motion , and parallax of neutron stars ( ns ) can be obtained by astrometry , and such measurements can be exploited to address a variety of scientific questions .",
    "for example , measuring the position of an object in two different coordinate frames permits the very fundamental operation of tying the two reference frames together . since they are compact sources and are accessible to astrometry with different techniques and at different wavelengths , ns are particularly well suited to such reference frame ties .",
    "specifically , the optical counterpart of the radio pulsar j0437@xmath24715 may provide a frame - tie between the optical reference frame and the radio - defined international celestial reference frame ( icrf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the space interferometry mission .",
    "precise proper motions for ns allow them to be traced back to their birth sites in massive stellar clusters , and to associations with runaway stars @xcite .",
    "for very young objects , associations with their progenitor supernova remnants can be verified or refuted , leading to independent age estimates for both the ns and the supernova remnant itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    combined with estimates for their distances ,",
    "the proper motions of ns also lead to velocity estimates .",
    "the high velocity tail of the distribution implies that large kicks are imparted to proto - neutron stars during core collapse , and a number of mechanisms have been proposed for these natal kicks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the proper motions of magnetars @xcite can potentially test the role of strong magnetic fields in such kicks , while precise comparisons of the proper motion and spin axis vectors of pulsars @xcite constrain the degree of rotational averaging in hydrodynamic kicks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when a parallax measurement is possible , a _ model independent _ estimate is obtained for the distance and velocity of the ns .",
    "each such measurement calibrates global models of the galactic electron density @xcite , thus improving distance estimates from pulse dispersion measure for the rest of the radio pulsar population , as well as probing the distribution of electron density in the local interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observed thermal radiation from the ns surface can be used , in combination with a precise distance , to constrain the size of the photosphere , the ns radius , and thus the equation of state of matter at extreme pressures and densities @xcite . for radio pulsars , uncertainties in the magnetospheric emission restrict such an exercise to very young and hot objects ( e.g. , psr  b0656 + 14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while isolated ns which are x - ray bright and radio quiet pose a challenge for optical astrometry ( e.g. , rx  j1856.5@xmath23754 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "astrometry can thus bring powerful constraints to bear on a variety of scientific questions about neutron stars , including their origins , astrophysics , evolution , and environments .",
    "the primary obstacle is the difficulty of such astrometric observations .",
    "as in most other astrometric applications , multiple position measurements of a given target over some time span are the basic observables from which astrometric parameters are derived . for individual objects , rather than an ensemble of stars over the entire sky ,",
    "such measurements are necessarily relative in nature , but absolute positions can be inferred from measurements relative to sources that define the icrf . over time , repeated measurements of the position @xmath3 allow a proper motion @xmath4 to be derived . for a precise proper motion ,",
    "the primary consideration is a long time baseline , limited by the stability of the reference frame and the variability or motion of the frame - defining sources . finally , with enough astrometric precision",
    ", a trigonometric parallax @xmath5 may also be measurable for ns .",
    "the primary consideration for such measurements is appropriate sampling over the earth s orbital phase , not just a long time baseline .",
    "neutron stars emit over a broad range of frequencies , and astrometric observations of ns have been conducted at bands from radio ( @xmath6  hz ) to x - rays ( @xmath7  hz ) .",
    "for example , @xcite have used optical observations with the hubble space telescope to determine a proper motion @xmath8  mas  yr@xmath9 and a parallax @xmath10  mas for rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 . however",
    ", only a few ns can be observed at optical or infra - red frequencies . in x - rays ,",
    "the resolution that can be achieved with the current generation of telescopes is a limiting factor , but @xcite have used the chandra x - ray observatory to measure a proper motion of @xmath11  mas  yr@xmath9 for the rx  j0822@xmath24300 , in the center of the puppis  a supernova remnant .",
    "the majority of known ns are radio pulsars , and pulse timing is routinely used to refine their positions and proper motions . a subset of recycled ( `` millisecond '' )",
    "pulsars have rotation rates that are stable enough to permit sub - milliarcsecond astrometry based on pulse time of arrival . as a particularly interesting example , @xcite use pulse timing at parkes to infer a precise distance for the binary pulsar  j0437@xmath24715 based on the observed orbital period derivative @xmath12 and the assumption that the intrinsic orbital period derivative is dominated by the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "the measurement leads to an estimate for the pulsar mass and an upper limit on the variation of the gravitational constant @xmath13 . however , most pulsars do not have such stable rotation , particularly when they are young , and very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) has usually been utilized to determine their astrometric parameters .",
    "such efforts have a long history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but have become much more feasible with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , which provides full - time , dedicated vlbi capabilities with identical antennas , allowing good control of systematic errors and leading to many recent parallax measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , not only are most pulsars faint , but the most interesting categories , namely the youngest pulsars and the recycled ones , appear to be disproportionately faint",
    ". pulsar gating ( which accumulates signal only during the predicted on - pulse periods for pulsars ) is now routinely employed to boost the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) for vlba astrometric observations , using contemporaneous pulse timing to reliably predict the pulse phase at the correlator . to make matters worse , however , it is not just a lack of sensitivity but systematic errors contributed by the ionosphere and the troposphere which are the primary impediments to sub - milliarcsecond astrometry .",
    "progress has been made , for example , with gps - based ionospheric calibration schemes ( walker & chatterjee 1999 , vlba scientific memo 23 ) and with wideband ionospheric calibration techniques @xcite . in - beam calibration @xcite , using a faint source in the same primary beam as the target source , has also proved to be effective @xcite .",
    "here we present a set of results from a large astrometric program to determine the proper motions and parallaxes of radio pulsars .",
    "the project involved a large scale initial survey at the very large array ( vla ) to identify target pulsars and detect in - beam calibrators , as discussed in , followed by multi - epoch observations with the vlba ( ) .",
    "we provide details of the calibration and data reduction in , and our use of the bootstrap method to estimate uncertainties is discussed in , as a template for ongoing and future vlba astrometry programs . some implications of our results are explored in , specifically for ns birth sites , galactic electron density models , and reference frame ties .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in .",
    "astrometric measurements with the vlba are conducted in the international celestial reference frame ( icrf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each pulsar of interest thus requires the identification of suitable nearby calibrators that tie the observations to the icrf .    in the northern hemisphere",
    ", the density of icrf sources and secondary calibration sources with sufficiently accurate positions in the icrf @xcite is about 0.1  deg@xmath14 , implying typical calibrator - target separations of @xmath152 , although the nearest calibrators can be as much as 5  distant in some cases .",
    "astrometric errors due to differential propagation effects through earth s ionosphere and troposphere scale with calibrator separation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requiring smaller angular separations for higher astrometric accuracy .",
    "the detection and use of compact sources considerably closer to the target than those in the existing catalogs offers a straightforward way to improve astrometric precision .",
    "unfortunately , only a small fraction of the many sufficiently bright point - like sources typically detected by the vla , even in its most extended ( highest resolution ) configuration , are compact enough ( @xmath16  mas ) to serve as vlba phase calibrators , owing either to intrinsic source size or to scattering by the intervening interstellar medium ( ism ) .    in our previous work",
    ", the search for such nearby compact calibrators has led to the development of `` in - beam calibration '' @xcite . here a compact source is identified within the same field of view ( i.e. , primary beam ) as the target source . for the 25-m dishes of the vla and vlba , this implies an angular separation less than @xmath1525  between the target and the in - beam source for observations at the upper end of our band ( @xmath17  ghz ) .",
    "such sources are likely to be weak , requiring the use of a stronger , more distant phase referencing source for initial calibration at each epoch , but the position of the target is thereafter referenced to the in - beam calibrator position . in - beam calibration has the dual benefit of allowing the calibrator and target to be observed simultaneously , thereby increasing the sensitivity for both objects , as well as reducing the angular extrapolation of the calibration solutions and eliminating the need to interpolate the calibration in time .",
    "an initial sample of 63 pulsars was chosen from the roughly one thousand pulsars known at the inception of this project in 2001 .",
    "pulsars were selected based primarily on flux density , declination , and dispersion measure distance estimate , so that precision astrometry was plausible using techniques refined in our previous work .",
    "a few pulsars were included since they were of particular scientific interest ( e.g. , the recycled pulsar  j1713 + 0747 ) even though they were expected to pose technical challenges ; sample completeness was not a consideration .",
    "the field of view around each of the 63 selected pulsars was observed with the vla between 2002 february  7 and  9 ( project code ac629 ) .",
    "given the similar 25-m diameters of the vla and vlba dishes , they have well matched primary beams at the same observation frequencies .",
    "each field was observed for @xmath1515 minutes at 1.4  ghz with the vla in its highest angular resolution a - configuration ( @xmath1514 at 1.4  ghz ) .",
    "a spectral - line observing mode was used , with a 23  mhz spectral window or bandpass , and the correlator output was dumped every 5  s ( as opposed to the more standard 10  s ) . the use of a spectral - line mode and short correlator dump times were both motivated by the desire to image the full field of view with minimal distortions due to time - average and bandwidth smearing @xcite .    in order to detect potential in - beam calibrators , as well as bright confusing sources within the primary beam and beyond , a low - resolution image with a diameter of 11 was searched for sources .",
    "small facets surrounding each source were then imaged and deconvolved at the full resolution , employing polyhedral imaging @xcite . for each field",
    ", self - calibration was used to improve the image dynamic range , and if a substantial improvement was obtained in the dynamic range , the source - finding process was repeated in an effort to identify any weaker sources that might have been missed in the first iteration .",
    "each detected source was inspected for compactness and cataloged with its brightness , position , and angular separation from the pulsar .",
    "a total of  1060 sources stronger than 1  mjy were detected in the 63 fields ; of these , 269 were within 25  of the target pulsar and were deemed compact enough ( unresolved at 14 resolution ) to warrant further investigation .",
    "at least one such candidate in - beam calibrator was found for 62 of the 63 target pulsars , and an example is shown in .",
    "in addition , the position of each pulsar was measured to a precision of between 02 and 005 , sufficient to enable the later vlba observations .",
    "the angular resolution of these preliminary vla observations was still a factor of 100 below that of the planned vlba observations .",
    "a second set of vla observations at 8.4  ghz was used to determine the sub - arcsecond structure and verify the compactness of the candidate in - beam calibrators , as well as to determine their spectral indices .",
    "each of the 269 candidate in - beam calibrators was observed in individual pointings on 2002 april  6 with the vla a - configuration at 8.4  ghz , which provides a resolution @xmath1502 .",
    "each source was observed for approximately 3  minutes in continuum mode with two 50  mhz spectral windows .",
    "sources that were resolved were rejected , leaving 97 compact sources as potential in - beam calibrators with the vlba , with at least one for all but eight of the original 63 pulsars .",
    "the refinement process is illustrated in , and details of all the candidate sources are archived online .      from the original sample of 63 pulsars ,",
    "34 were selected for observations with the vlba , most of them with good candidate in - beam calibrators .",
    "a few pulsars were judged to be strong enough and to have a cataloged vlba calibrator that was close enough that phase referencing , in combination with wideband ionospheric calibration @xcite , would provide accurate astrometry .",
    "these pulsars will be discussed in future work .    in the first epoch of vlba observations ,",
    "most of the selected pulsars were found to have at least one suitable in - beam calibrator , as illustrated in . however , the in - beam candidates for 7 pulsars were either not detected or were too heavily resolved to be useful .",
    "in addition , 3 pulsars were not detected in first epoch vlba observations due to scattering or poor calibration at lower declinations ; these were discarded from our observing list , and substituted with other targets .",
    "the process outlined here was optimized to identify pulsars where a parallax measurement seemed plausible based on our previous experience .",
    "no attempt was made to preserve sample completeness or to image each possible in - beam calibrator candidate exhaustively , and as such , it is difficult to infer detailed statistical properties for the ensemble of faint , compact background sources . of the 97 sources that were found to be compact in both 1.4  ghz and 8.4  ghz",
    "vla a - configuration observations , the vast majority ( 75 sources ) had a negative spectral index ( @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ) , as expected for non - thermal sources .",
    "( the spectral index was determined after correcting measured flux densities at 1.4  ghz for primary beam attenuation . ) specifically , @xmath20 for 43 sources , and @xmath21 for 16 sources .",
    "we emphasize that these results do not necessarily contradict the notion that compact sources tend to have flat spectral indices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our sample is faint , and likely to include a mixture of different kinds of objects , including some core - jet sources .",
    "additionally , our two - point spectral index might straddle a peak in the spectrum , producing an apparent distribution of spectral indices that is hard to interpret .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find broadly similar spectral index distributions for their source samples .",
    "while pulsar astrometric observations have previously been conducted on a number of vlbi networks , the vlba has several features that are particularly well suited to astrometry .",
    "the identical dishes of the vlba simplify the calibration and ensure control of systematic errors , and the identical primary beams ( as well as the match with the primary beam of the vla dishes ) is particularly advantageous for in - beam calibration . in a heterogeneous array , in - beam calibrators",
    "would have to be restricted to the field of view of the largest telescope in the network , which can severely restrict the chances of finding a suitable calibrator .",
    "secondly , full - time operation and flexible dynamic scheduling allow several short observations of each target through the year , timed to track parallax extrema and to avoid observations through the solar corona .",
    "thirdly , the vlba was designed for phase referenced observations with rapid slews and short dwell times , and provides repeatable phase stability , an essential component for astrometry .",
    "finally , pulsar astrometry in particular can take advantage of pulsar gating , where the vlba correlator effectively accumulates signal only when the radio pulse is predicted to arrive and discards the noise at other times .",
    "our choice of observing frequency balances competing priorities .",
    "radio pulsars typically have steep spectra ( @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ) , and thus are brighter at lower frequencies .",
    "additionally , the larger field of view at lower frequencies enhances the likelihood of finding in - beam calibrators , and tropospheric phase fluctuations are reduced at lower frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "the synthesized beam is broader , resulting in lower astrometric precision when sensitivity is the limiting factor ( the case for many of the targets and calibrators here ) , and the phase distortions due to the differential ionosphere between the target and the calibrator increase rapidly at lower frequencies .",
    "an observing frequency around 1.5  ghz was chosen as a compromise between these effects , as demonstrated in our various pilot projects @xcite ; the residual differential ionospheric effects remain the largest source of astrometric uncertainty in our program .    in an effort to minimize systematic errors between epochs ,",
    "all of the observations were set up in as identical a manner as possible .",
    "dual circular polarization was recorded simultaneously in four separate 8-mhz spectral windows .",
    "these bands were nyquist sampled with 4-level quantization .",
    "we chose widely spread spectral windows to enable calibration of the ionosphere @xcite for cases where in - beam calibration proved difficult and the pulsar was deemed bright enough to allow this method to succeed .",
    "the in - beam calibration technique described in the present work does not make use of the wide - spread bands .",
    "the initial set of spectral windows was centered on 1414 , 1489 , 1594 , 1684  mhz , choices that were informed by presence of known satellite - generated interference .",
    "after routinely encountering strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , the second spectral window was changed to a central frequency of 1508  mhz .",
    "these spectral windows proved to be relatively rfi - free for most of the observations , although strong narrow - band rfi was occasionally observed around 1684  mhz , mainly at the mauna kea site .",
    "the vlba pulse calibration system was turned off during these observations in order to reduce the total system temperature by about 3% .    at each epoch , an observation cycled between the field containing the pulsar and its in - beam calibrator(s ) and a vlbi reference calibrator .",
    "the vlbi reference calibrators , which are listed in , were drawn from the standard vlbi catalogs @xcite and are the ultimate means by which the observations are tied to the icrf .",
    "the calibrator was chosen primarily for proximity to the target pulsar , though strength and compactness requirements drove some choices . the pointing direction for a target field",
    "was set to be between the pulsar and its in - beam calibrator , with the restriction that the offset from the pulsar be no more than 6 ; for some pulsars , two in - beam calibrators could be identified and the pointing was set to lie between all three sources in the field .",
    "each observation spanned a duration of 2  hours approximately centered on the transit time of the source at the center of the vlba .",
    "we used interleaved scans of 90  seconds on the reference calibrator and 120  seconds on the target field , resulting in a total integration time of about 1  hour on the target field after accounting for slewing overheads .",

    "the most accurate estimates of these eops are typically available only after a time lag of several weeks , well after data correlation . moreover",
    ", during the course of this project , it was discovered that the vlba correlator had inadvertently been provided with predicted rather than measured eops ( walker et al .",
    "2005 , vlba test memo 69 ) .",
    "the resultant differential astrometric errors are potentially as large as @xmath35  mas , dwarfing the astrometric error budget .",
    "the correction for this was a delay offset computed between the delay model using the ( incorrect ) correlation eops and the actual eops , and this correction was applied to each data set .",

    "coarse ionospheric correction : _ precision astrometry requires correction for the differential phase and delay effects introduced by signal propagation through the earth s ionosphere .",

    "the former causes an overall decrease in the signal - to - noise of the astrometry by broadening the image .",
    "the latter introduces an unknown , unwanted position offset , directly impacting the astrometric results .    the ionospheric total electron content ( tec )",
    "can be estimated by measuring the propagation delay between global positioning system ( gps ) signals at two different frequencies along the lines of sight to the constellation of gps satellites .",

    "these maps are relatively coarse , typically quantifying the ionospheric tec on a grid with pixels spaced 5  in longitude and 25 in latitude , and updated every 2  hr . while these coarse models are far from sufficient for precision astrometry , walker & chatterjee ( 1999 , vlba scientific memo 23 ) use them to find a reduction in phase delay scatter by a factor of 2 to 5 at 2.2  ghz , and using them to correct for ionospheric dispersion delay did improve phase referencing .      even though the spectral windows were chosen to minimize the overlap with known sources of interference , some residual rfi persisted in the data . while the usual interferometric practice is to edit data on a per - baseline basis",
    ", we concluded that rfi could be identified on an _ antenna _ basis , i.e. , identified with being present only on baselines common to a specific antenna .",
    "therefore , we could identify and flag rfi based on the autocorrelation data at each antenna , and baseline - based rfi excision was only rarely needed .    data inspection and editing required extensive human intervention .",

    "phase , delay , and bandpass calibrations for vlbi are typically derived from observations of calibrator sources .",

    "_ bandpass calibration : _ after fringe - fitting , calibrator data from all epochs on a particular target were combined , and the inner 26 of the 32 channels in each frequency band were then imaged .",
    "several iterations of imaging and self - calibration were performed to create a final calibrator image , averaged over all observation epochs .",
    "the resulting ` global ' calibrator model was used for bandpass calibration at each epoch , determining a phase and amplitude gain factor for each of the 32 channels of each frequency band , for each antenna .",

    "_ frequency division : _ the calibrator structure did not change significantly over the duration of the project , enabling us to build time - averaged models . however , in some cases the calibrator images showed significant frequency dependent structure .",
    "as such , after the initial fringe - fitting and bandpass calibration , we used separate calibrator models for each frequency band .",
    "_ phase and amplitude calibration : _ for each frequency band , calibrator data from all epochs were combined , and an imaging and self - calibration loop was used to derive an epoch - averaged calibrator model .",
    "the global calibrator model produced for bandpass calibration was used as the initial model in each case .",
    "phase and amplitude calibrations were then derived independently for each epoch and frequency band , using calibrator models that were averaged over all epochs but not over frequencies . the phase and amplitude calibration",
    "was then applied to the target source ( i.e. , either the pulsar or the in - beam calibrator ) and written to a single - source , calibrated uv database . in order to ensure that the data for the pulsar and in - beam calibrator(s ) were identically calibrated , we derived the fringe - fitting , bandpass calibration , and phase / amplitude calibration for one correlation pass and copied these tables to all subsequent correlation passes .    at the end of this calibration sequence",
    "there were typically 32  calibrated single - source uv databases per pulsar and per in - beam calibrator , one for each of 4  frequency bands at 8  epochs .",
    "the angular separation between an in - beam calibrator and the target pulsar ( typically @xmath151520 ) is much smaller than their angular separation from the phase calibrator ( typically @xmath1523 ) . as such",
    ", most of the residual calibration errors will be common to the pulsar and the in - beam source , and we can exploit in - beam calibrators to incrementally improve the calibration of the pulsar .    as for the phase calibrators",
    ", we created independent models for in - beam calibrators at each frequency band by combining and imaging the calibrated visibility data from all epochs at that band .",
    "a few passes of self - calibration ( usually phase - only , but including amplitude self - calibration for in - beam sources brighter than @xmath39  mjy ) were used to improve the models . since in - beam calibrators are usually fairly weak ( @xmath40  mjy ) and show some source structure , we required longer time averages and lower s / n cutoffs for the calibration solutions , up to a limit of 5  minutes of averaging and s / n @xmath41 .",
    "this lower s / n threshold was determimed to maximize the s / n in the phase - referenced image of the pulsar after the phase transfer from the in - beam calibration solutions ; calibrators with different characteristics may be optimized with slightly different cutoff values . in some cases , the in - beam source had enough resolved structure that the longest baselines of the vlba ( to saint croix and mauna kea ) had to be discarded .",
    "even in such cases , using in - beam calibration provided superior astrometric results compared to retaining the longest baselines while only referencing observations to the more distant phase calibrator .    with an epoch - averaged model for the in - beam calibrator at each frequency band , we used a final pass of phase - only self - calibration to obtain phase corrections .",
    "these corrections were applied to the calibrated pulsar data and used for subsequent imaging .",
    "since the target pulsars are intrinsically compact , the final imaging step is quite simple .",
    "the vlba beam is north - south elongated , with typical dimensions of @xmath42  mas for our chosen frequencies , observation durations , and selection of source declinations .",
    "we used pixel sizes of @xmath43  mas and approximately natural weighting ( an aips ` robustness ' parameter of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 corresponds to pure natural weighting and @xmath46 corresponds to uniform visibility weights ; see @xcite ) .",
    "many of the target pulsars have observed diffractive scintillation timescales at 1.5  ghz that are comparable to the 2  hr observation span , and so their sidelobes are often not well subtracted .",
    "for this reason support constraints ( i.e. ` boxes ' ) were used to restrict the region to be cleaned , and we stopped the cleaning process interactively once the residuals within the support box were at the level of the image noise far from the pulsar .",
    "finally , we determined astrometric positions for our targets at each epoch and frequency band by fitting elliptical gaussians in the image domain .",
    "at the end of the calibration and imaging process , we are left with a set of positions @xmath47 at each epoch @xmath48 and frequency band @xmath49 .",
    "we fit these positions with a five - parameter astrometric model encompassing position @xmath50 , proper motion @xmath51 ) , and parallax @xmath52 using a standard weighted linear least squares technique . the key problem is the determination of the weights , and hence the fit uncertainties , in the presence of unknown systematic errors at each epoch .    at each epoch , the target position errors have a ( random ) measurement error component , corresponding to the beam fwhm/@xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the signal - to - noise ratio of the final pulsar image .",
    "however , using only these random errors produces fits with reduced @xmath55 values @xmath56 , implying the presence of unmodeled systematic errors . in vlbi astrometry at 1.5  ghz , the biggest systematic error component is usually due to the residual unmodeled ionosphere between the in - beam calibrator and the target pulsar , with other possible contributions from errors in the earth orientation parameters ( c.f .  ) , calibrator position errors , or structural evolution of the calibrators .",
    "the calibrator position errors could in principle impart a significant ( @xmath57as ) time - dependent error on the phase - referenced position measurements .",
    "( we note that uniformly observing a given target over the same hour angle range causes calibrator source position errors to produce a consistent astrometric offset at each epoch , affecting only the absolute position determination . ) a common approach to treating unmodeled errors is to inflate all the random errors by a trial factor until a reduced @xmath55 value @xmath58 is obtained . however , the residual ionospheric errors , for example , depend on the proximity of the sun ( c.f .  ) , and since the separation varies with season , scaling the random errors at each epoch by the same factor would not be optimal . in cases where the angular separation between the sun and the target is more than 30 ,",
    "the uncalibrated ionosphere typically yields astrometric errors of @xmath59as for a 1   target - calibrator separation at an observing frequency of 1.5  ghz .    in our past programs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we have investigated several possible measures of the epoch - dependent systematic error , including the angular size of the pulsar image and its deviations from the beam shape , or the scatter between the positions determined at each frequency band at a given epoch .",
    "while these measures are useful , they are not perfect , and regression analysis between the estimated systematic error and parameters such as the sun angle or the elevation of the source above the horizon do not reveal a simple correlation .    instead we choose to estimate the fit uncertainties from the position measurements themselves using the bootstrap technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we treat the @xmath60 data points @xmath61 at each epoch and frequency band as independent estimates of the ( time dependent ) position , and select @xmath60 samples from the set _ with replacement _ , discarding degenerate samples with fewer than three independent positions .",
    "we then fit the sample for astrometric parameters using standard weighted least squares , using only the random measurement uncertainties .",
    "the process of sampling and fitting is repeated a large number of times .",
    "each resulting fit generally has a reduced @xmath62 , but only the values of the fit parameters are of interest .",
    "histograms of the resulting fit parameters are shown for a typical case with 50,000 sampling iterations ( psr  b2310 + 42 , ) .",
    "it is apparent that the parameters follow a smooth distribution with a well - defined most probable value ( the distribution mode ) .",
    "the most probable value for each astrometric parameter and their most compact 68% confidence intervals as estimated from the bootstrap method are listed in for the fourteen pulsars in our final sample .",
    "the most probable values and confidence intervals for the distances and transverse velocities of these pulsars were also derived directly via bootstrap , and are listed in .    in all cases ,",
    "the values of the parameters estimated by the bootstrap method were consistent with the parameters obtained by simple least squares fitting ( using all epochs without replacement ) to well within the bootstrap 68% confidence interval .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the estimates of the astrometric parameters differed between the two methods . the power of the technique is illustrated by our worst - case scenario ( psr  j1713 + 0747 , ) , which was the only case where a bimodal distribution was obtained for any of the parameters .",
    "the bimodality in @xmath63 reflects the presence or absence of one well - measured position , and causes the uncertainties to deviate significantly from symmetry",
    ". however , there is no ambiguity in the most probable parameter values or in the bootstrap confidence intervals .",

    "psr  b0450@xmath218 requires @xmath198  km  s@xmath9  at its most probable distance inferred from bootstrap ( @xmath199  kpc ) , which may not be unreasonable , but in any case it has the largest uncertainties among the objects in our sample ( c.f .  ) .      in our analysis of pulsar trajectories ,",
    "psr  b2045@xmath216 was found to pass on the sky within @xmath185  pc of the open cluster ngc  6604 for a radial velocity @xmath200  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "since the distance between the cluster and the pulsar was also @xmath201  pc , ngc  6604 could be the birth location of psr  b2045@xmath216 . if it was born in this cluster , the kinematic age of psr  b2045@xmath216 is @xmath202  myr , slightly less than its spin - down age @xmath203  myr .",
    "ngc  6604 is an open cluster with an age @xmath204  myr @xcite .",
    "we infer that the progenitor of psr  b2045@xmath216 was probably more massive than @xmath185  m@xmath205 and that the birth velocity of the pulsar was @xmath206  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the mismatch between the spin - down age and kinematic age can be resolved if the initial spin period of the pulsar was @xmath207  ms , assuming a fixed braking index @xmath193 , consistent with the population birth spin period distribution ( @xmath208  ms ) found by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the initial spin period is assumed to be much smaller than its current period , the kinematic age implies a braking index @xmath209 , which is larger than all measured values to date and thus an unlikely explanation .",
    "further analysis will need to confirm the association of psr  b2045@xmath216 with ngc  6604 , taking into account the proper motion of ngc  6604 ( @xmath210  mas  yr@xmath9 , @xmath211  mas  yr@xmath9 * ? ? ? * ) , which corresponds to a motion on the sky of @xmath212  pc in 2  myr .",
    "model independent distances to pulsars provide essential calibration points for models of the galactic electron density distribution such as ne2001 @xcite , and one of the objectives of our observations is to use new pulsar distances to improve successors to ne2001 . we have compared our astrometric distance estimates with those obtained from ne2001 , as illustrated in . in constructing ne2001 , @xcite estimated the uncertainty in the distances derived from the pulse dispersion measure ( dm ) to be 20% . for the purposes of our comparison , we do not include the ne2001 uncertainty estimate , but consider only whether the ne2001 distance estimate is within the 68% and 99% confidence intervals of the parallax distance .    of the 14 pulsars in our sample ,",
    "the ne2001 distance estimates are in approximate agreement with our parallax determinations ( within or just beyond the 68% confidence intervals ) for  9 of the pulsars .",
    "the other five pulsars ( b0031@xmath207 , b1508 + 55 , b2045@xmath216 , b1541 + 09 , and b0450 + 55 ) are discussed below .",
    "three of the discrepant pulsars ( , , and ) have high galactic latitudes @xmath213 and low dms @xmath214  pc  @xmath215 .",
    "the ne2001 model contains a set of low electron density components designed to reproduce the effects of local galactic structure , namely regions such as the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , a local low density region ( ldr ) , and the local superbubble ( lsb ) .",
    "the distances to these three pulsars are large enough that none are within any of these local , low - density regions .",
    "thus , these local structures can not be the explanation for the systematic discrepancies .",
    "@xcite have re - analyzed the available dm data toward high galactic latitude pulsars and find that the scale height of the ionized gas is approximately 1.8  kpc , about a factor of  2 higher than the thick disk component in the ne2001 model . analyzing the dm data in combination with emission measures ( em ) derived from h@xmath216 observations , they also conclude that the filling factor of the ionized gas increases with distance above the galactic plane .    using the @xcite re - assessment for the ionized gas scale height , we have estimated the distances to these pulsars from their dms . in general , the resulting distances are slight over - estimates relative to their parallax distances .",
    "we conclude that the new parallax distances and the dms of these pulsars are consistent with the conclusion of @xcite of a larger scale height for the ionized gas , though their estimated scale height of 1.8  kpc may be a bit too high .",
    "a revised fit including the new distances presented here indeed yields a slightly lower scale height ( b.  m.  gaensler , personal communication ) , but does not significantly alter the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the ism is likely to be significantly irregular or patchy on the relevant length scales , particularly at high galactic latitudes , where chimmneys and voids are important contributors to the structure .",
    "is also at high galactic latitude ( @xmath217 ) but has a relatively large dm ( 35.24  pc  @xmath218 ) .",
    "this dm is above the maximal value ( @xmath219  pc  @xmath215 ) from the thick disk component in the ne2001 model , which only provides lower limits on the pulsar distance .",
    "thus , in order to reproduce the dm , the ne2001 model includes a `` clump '' of enhanced electron density ( contributing about  10% of the total dm ) , though @xcite could find no obvious feature along the line of sight that might generate this clump ( e.g. , an region or  o star ) .",
    "this line of sight also passes above two spiral arms in the ne2001 model .",
    "one possibility is that the scale height of the ionized gas above one or both of these arms is larger than included in the model .",
    "lastly , lies at a relatively low galactic latitude ( @xmath220 ) , with dm @xmath221  pc  @xmath215 . at the parallax distance to the pulsar ,",
    "the dm inferred from the ne2001 model is 33  pc  @xmath218 , much larger than what is observed .",
    "the situation can plausibly be explained by a deficit of electrons in this direction . within the ne2001 model ,",
    "there are attempts to account for such deficits ( `` voids '' ) in the electron density along specific lines of sight , but such modeling is limited by the sparseness of available dm - independent distance estimates .    we have examined both the virginia tech spectral - line survey h-@xmath216 image and the wham h-@xmath216 survey @xcite ; neither shows any indication that the line of sight toward the pulsar has any deficit of h-@xmath216 emission compared to nearby lines of sight .",
    "however , a co survey @xcite shows a tongue of co emission that crosses the line of sight to the pulsar .",
    "while the filling factor of the co gas along the line of sight to the pulsar may not be large , its presence suggests that not all of the line of sight may be ionized , consistent with an apparent void in the electron density along the line of sight to this pulsar .",
    "pulse timing provides radio pulsar positions in the solar system reference frame , while vlbi measurements are tied to the distant quasars . simply measuring precise positions for pulsars via the two different techniques enables fundamental reference frame ties between the solar system and the extragalactic icrf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the recycled pulsar j1713 + 0747 is now one of two pulsars ( along with psr  j0437@xmath24715 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with high - precision astrometry and statistically significant measurements of parallax using _ both _ pulse timing and vlbi .",
    "in we list the astrometric parameters for psr  j1713 + 0747 as determined by interferometry ( this work ) as well as by two independent pulse timing efforts @xcite .",
    "lrrr @xmath222 ( s ) & 0.5306(1 ) & 0.5307826(7 ) & 0.53077(1 ) + @xmath223 ( ) & 0.519(2 ) & 0.52339(3 ) & 0.5228(2 ) + @xmath31 ( mas yr@xmath9 ) & 4.75@xmath224 & 4.917(4 ) & 4.97(6 ) + @xmath32 ( mas yr@xmath9 ) & @xmath23.67(16 ) & @xmath23.933(10 ) & @xmath23.7(1 ) + @xmath5 ( mas ) & 0.95(6 ) & 0.89(8 ) & 1.1(1 ) +    the data used by @xcite span 12 years ( though with a 4 year gap ) , allowing compensation for timing noise .",
    "in contrast , @xcite used data spanning only 2.5 years , which did not allow corrections for timing noise , but allowed them to minimize systematics through the consistency of their instrumental setup .",
    "we note that the overall consistency between the timing and vlbi results for proper motion and parallax is quite good , although the position differs in declination at the @xmath15mas level .",
    "the longer time series allows @xcite to attain higher precision in their proper motion estimates , but the uncertainties in parallax are comparable between the 12 year timing data set and the 2 year vlbi data , illustrating the complementarity of the techniques . an ensemble of such measurements on recycled pulsars has great promise for reference frame ties , as well as for the detection of gravitational waves .",
    "by simply measuring the positions of neutron stars over time to high accuracy , it is possible to establish constraints on a variety of scientific questions .",
    "here we have presented the motivation , methods , and results from a large vlba astrometry program .",
    "we have described our initial vla surveys to select targets and find in - beam calibrators , as well as vlba observations , pulsar gating , and data reduction .",

    "we have also described the use of the bootstrap method to comprehensively treat unmodeled systematic errors .",
    "the methods described here are serving as templates for our ongoing astrometry programs , and may serve as useful guidelines for the wider community .    as a result of our vlba astrometry program ,",
    "we have measured new parallaxes and proper motions for 14 pulsars , including @xmath225  mas for psr  b1541 + 09 .",
    "the measurements have been exploited to investigate their kinematics and birth sites .",
    "young pulsars are found to be leaving the galactic plane , as expected , and we also find that spindown ages and kinematic ages are generally in reasonable agreement , with some notable exceptions .",
    "we have identified a plausible birth site for psr  b1508 + 55 in one of the cyg ob associations @xcite and for psr  b2045@xmath216 in the open cluster ngc  6604 ( this work ) .",
    "the new model - independent distances have also allowed us to revisit models of the galactic electron density distribution . comparing distance estimates from parallax and pulse dispersion measure",
    ", we find that ne2001 underestimates distances for some objects at high galactic latitudes , while for others the estimates agree with or are larger than the parallax distances .",
    "our findings are consistent with a larger scale height or with irregularities in the ism on relevant length scales .",
    "independent distance measurements are essential to calibrate models and probe structure in the ism , and the present sample will be incorporated into future iterations of the electron density distribution model , ultimately improving dm - based distance estimates for all pulsars .",
