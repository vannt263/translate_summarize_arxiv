    "<S> the position and momentum  space information entropies of the electron distributions of atomic clusters are calculated using a woods  saxon single particle potential . </S>",
    "<S> the same entropies are also calculated for nuclear distributions according to the skyrme parametrization of the nuclear mean field . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that a similar functional form @xmath0 for the entropy as function of the number of particles @xmath1 holds approximately for atoms , nuclei and atomic clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it is conjectured that this is a universal property of a many - fermion system in a mean field . </S>",
    "<S> it is also seen that there is an analogy of our expression for @xmath2 to boltzmann s thermodynamic entropy @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 89.70.+c ; 36.40.+d ; 31.10.+z ; 21.60.-n    information  theoretical methods have played in recent years an important role in the study of quantum mechanical systems @xcite in two cases : first in the clarification of fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and second in the synthesis of probability densities in position and momentum spaces . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> an important step was the discovery of an entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) by bialynicki  </S>",
    "<S> birula and mycielski @xcite which for a three  dimensional system has the form : @xmath4 ( see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the one  dimensional case ) . in ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is the shannon information entropy in position  </S>",
    "<S> space : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the corresponding entropy in momentum - space : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the position and momentum  </S>",
    "<S> space density distributions respectively , which are normalized to one . however , for a normalization to the number of particles @xmath1 , the following eur holds @xcite : @xmath11    inequality ( 1 ) , for the information entropy sum in conjugate spaces , is a joint measure of uncertainty of a quantum mechanical distribution , since a highly localized @xmath9 is associated with a diffuse @xmath10 , leading to low @xmath5 and high @xmath7 and vice  versa . </S>",
    "<S> expression ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) is an information  theoretical uncertainty relation stronger than heisenberg s @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that expression ( [ ( 1 ) ] ) does not depend on the unit of length in measuring @xmath9 and @xmath10 i.e. the sum @xmath12 is invariant to uniform scaling of coordinates .    </S>",
    "<S> gadre @xcite derived the following approximate expression for the information entropies of electron distributions in atoms : @xmath13 using thomas - fermi theory and gadre et al @xcite derived : @xmath14 with hartee - fock calculations . here , @xmath1 is the number of electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> panos and massen @xcite found the following expression for nuclear distributions , employing the simple harmonic oscillator ( ho ) model of the nucleus : @xmath15 where @xmath1 is the number of nucleons in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> relations of the same functional form hold for @xmath5 and @xmath7 separately but the important quantity is @xmath16 .    there is a striking similarity of ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with the eur ( 4 ) , indicating that the functional form @xmath17 is universal for a many - fermion system in a mean field .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the above relations were derived for a normalization of @xmath9 and @xmath10 to the number of particles @xmath1 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we find it more convenient to normalize to one . </S>",
    "<S> there is a simple relationship between the two cases and we can easily transform one case to the other according to the relations : @xmath18=\\frac{s_r[norm = n]}{n}+\\ln n\\ ] ] @xmath19=\\frac{s_k[norm = n]}{n}+\\ln n\\ ] ] hence , we have for normalization to one , the following expressions : @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    in the present letter we extend our calculations for two other cases : the distribution of the valence electrons in atomic clusters using a woods  saxon single particle potential and the nuclear distribution in nuclei employing the skyrme parametrization of the nuclear mean field .    in atomic ( metallic ) clusters </S>",
    "<S> the effective radial electronic potential was derived by ekardt @xcite in his spherical  jellium  background  </S>",
    "<S> model study of the self  consistent charge density and the self  consistent effective one  particle potential , using the local density approximations . </S>",
    "<S> ekardt s potentials for neutral sodium clusters were parametrized in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by a woods  saxon potential of the form :    @xmath23 } \\label{(11)}\\ ] ]    with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for a detailed study regarding the parametrization of ekardt </S>",
    "<S> s potentials see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we solved numerically the schrdinger equation for atomic clusters with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 valence electrons in the potential ( [ ( 11 ) ] ) and found the wave functions of the single  particle states in configuration space and by fourier transform the corresponding ones in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> using the above wave functions , we calculated the electron density @xmath9 in position space and @xmath10 in momentum space , which were inserted into equations ( [ ( 2 ) ] ) , ( [ ( 3 ) ] ) and gave us the values of the information entropies @xmath5 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> then we fitted the form @xmath0 to these values and obtained the expressions : @xmath36    next the nuclear densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 for several nuclei were obtained with hartee  fock calculations using the skyrme parametrization of the nuclear mean field . </S>",
    "<S> there are various parametrizations of the skyrme interaction , but they affect slightly the information entropies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we used the skiii interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we fitted the form @xmath37 to the values obtained with skiii interaction and we found the expressions : @xmath38    the fit is in reasonably good agreement with its h.o . </S>",
    "<S> counterpart ( comparison of relation ( [ ( 17 ) ] ) to ( [ ( 10 ) ] ) ) , though the individual entropies @xmath5 and @xmath7 do not match with the respective ho ones @xcite that well . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that there is a delicate balance between the coordinate and momentum spaces , so that the interesting quantity is the sum @xmath39 ( the net information content of the system ) and not the individual entropies @xmath5 and @xmath7 .    in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we plot our fitted form @xmath40 for atoms ( with hartee - fock , relation ( [ ( 9 ) ] ) , upper curve ) , atomic neutral na clusters ( relation ( [ ( 14 ) ] ) , middle curve ) and nuclei ( with skyrme , relation ( [ ( 17 ) ] ) , lower curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> these lines correspond to our fitted expressions , while the corresponding values of our numerical calculations are denoted by solid circles ( clusters ) and open circles ( nuclei with skiii interaction ) .    </S>",
    "<S> concluding , in the present letter we derive an interesting characteristic of information entropies @xmath5 and @xmath7 for various systems i.e. atoms ( thomas  fermi theory , hartee  fock ) , nuclei ( harmonic oscillator model , skyrme force ) and atomic clusters(woods  </S>",
    "<S> saxon potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> for all of these systems the entropies can be represented well by a function , which incorporates @xmath41 linearly i.e. @xmath42 where @xmath1 is the number of electrons in atoms or nucleons in nuclei or electrons in atomic clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we may conjecture that this is a universal property of a many - fermion system in a mean field . as stated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the information entropies seem to be a hidden treasure , as yet remains mostly unexplored .    </S>",
    "<S> a final comment seems appropriate : there is an analogy of our expression @xmath43 to boltzmann s thermodynamic entropy @xmath3 ( @xmath44 is boltzmann s constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as follows : our relation can be written in the form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the above entropy is the information entropy @xmath47 , which is related to the physical entropy @xmath48 through jaynes relation : @xmath49 . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , we have : @xmath50 here @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend on the system under consideration ( atom , cluster or nucleus ) , but this dependence is not strong . </S>",
    "<S> one can take that @xmath53 ( actually equals @xmath54 for atoms , 0.907 for clusters and </S>",
    "<S> 0.860 for nuclei ) and @xmath55 ( because @xmath56 for atoms , @xmath57 for nuclei and @xmath58 for clusters ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain the following rough estimate for the entropy of a many  fermion system : @xmath59 the number @xmath60 corresponds to the number of equiprobable microstates @xmath61 of boltzmann s relation .    </S>",
    "<S> hence , starting from shannon s information entropies of quantum  mechanical distributions , we arrived at relation ( [ ( 18 ) ] ) , which can be considered as a quantum - mechanical analogue to boltzmann s entropy @xmath3 . </S>"
