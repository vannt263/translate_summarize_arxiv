    "about two thirds of the known lmxbs are persistent and the remaining one third are transient sources ( van paradijs 1995 ) . the transient sources exhibit a soft x - ray spectrum during outbursts ( soft x - ray transients @xmath2sxts ) .",
    "an optical outburst also occurs together with the x - ray outburst . during an outburst the x - ray and the optical properties of black - hole soft x - ray transients ( bsxts ) and neutron star soft x - ray transients ( nsxts ) are very similar to each other and also to those of persistent sources .",
    "x - ray luminosities of   sxts   increase from below @xmath3erg  s@xmath4 to @xmath5-@xmath6 erg  s@xmath4   during an outburst .",
    "the time scales for decline range from several tens of days to more than one hundred days .",
    "although some sources show rather monotonic decline in many cases there is more complex behavior .",
    "some sources remain persistent for more than one year .",
    "most of the light curves show a steepening around @xmath7erg  s@xmath4 corresponding to a mass accretion rate @xmath8 g  s@xmath4 inferred from the x - ray luminosity .",
    "later they turn back to their quiescent states with @xmath9erg  s@xmath4 and @xmath10 g  s@xmath4   ( tanaka @xmath11 shibazaki  1996   and references therein ) .",
    "there are nine known x - ray binaries with strong black - hole candidate primaries ( van paradijs 1995 ) .",
    "three of these sources are non - transient high mass systems and the remaining six are transient lmxbs  ( table 1 ) .",
    "four bsxts in this group , a0620 - 00 , gs 2000 + 25 ,  gs / grs 1124 - 68   and gro j0422 + 32   show striking similarities .",
    "their outbursts have fast rise times around a few days .",
    "the decay phases can be fit with exponentials with time constants around one month . during decline",
    "all four sources exhibit secondary ( mini ) outbursts .",
    "a0620 - 00 , gs / grs  1124 - 68 show also tertiary outbursts .",
    "the tertiary outburst is absent in the light curve of  gro j0422 + 32 , but it may also be present in gs  2000 + 25 .",
    "secondary maxima were detected around 80 days after the onset of the main outburst of gs  2000 + 25 and gs / grs  1124 - 68 .",
    "a0620 - 00 and gro j0422 + 32 exhibited the secondary maxima 50 days and 125 days after the onset respectively . for both gs  0620 - 00 and gs / gro  1124 - 68 the tertiary maxima were observed about 200 days after the onset of the main outburst ( tanaka @xmath0 shibazaki  1996 ) .",
    "the basic features of the mini outbursts are the sharp increase in luminosity by a factor of  @xmath12   and decay patterns which mimic the decay after the first outburst .",
    "a0620 - 00   is a recurrent transient with a recurrence time of  58   years  ( tsunemi et al 1989 ) .",
    "the outbursts of the other sources were detected only once putting a lower limit to their recurrence times of around a few ten years   ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these similarities allow the working hypothesis that all of these sources run with a similar mechanism .",
    "since the conditions for outburst build up in the quiescent state it is important to treat the observations made during quiescence . according to the standard disk model ( shakura @xmath0 sunyaev 1973 ) most of the x - rays ( @xmath13 ) come from the inner parts of the disk extending to a radius which is around ten times the radius of the last stable orbit , @xmath14 @xmath15 . during the quiescent state it is possible to fit a black - body curve roughly to the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , inner disk temperatures of@xmath16kev obtained from these fits give very small values  ( @xmath17km@xmath18 ) for the x - ray emitting area of the disk , while realistic areas imply temperatures that are orders of magnitude smaller than the soft x - ray temperatures that fit the spectra .",
    "a disk becomes optically thin below a certain accretion rate depending on the viscosity parameter @xmath19 ( shakura @xmath0 sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "an optically thin or gray disk may be one way of explaining this inner disk problem .",
    "the mass accretion rates obtained from the optical observations during quiescence ( @xmath20 g  s@xmath4 ) are orders of magnitude larger than those ( @xmath21 g  s@xmath4 ) obtained from the x - ray luminosities ( see , e.g. , mcclintock et al 1995 , for these questions in a0620 - 00 ) .",
    "an advection dominated inner disk has been proposed to account for the properties of bsxts . according to this model most of the energy released in the inner disk",
    "is advected into the compact star instead of being radiated from the disk ( narayan et al 1996 ) . regarding the difference between mass accretion rates obtained from optical and x - ray luminosities during the quiescent states , the nsxts are similar to bsxts .",
    "although this model could explain the observed spectra and also the low x - ray luminosities of bsxts in quiescence it is not able to explain the properties of nsxts because of the existence of the solid surfaces of the neutron stars : whatever the disk structure is matter finally reaches the neutron star surface which should produce a distinct black - body like emission .    another possibility is mass accumulation in the outer regions of the disk .",
    "this accumulated matter may be the source of the outburst .",
    "for both bsxts and nsxts , the mass accretion rate inferred from optical observations may indicate the mass accretion rate arriving to accumulate in the outer disk , while the much lower @xmath22 inferred from the x - ray luminosity may reflect the trickle of mass that proceeds through a mass - starved inner disk characteristic of the quiescent state .",
    "this qualitative picture would persist until the mass accumulated in the outer disk reaches the level critical for an outburst .",
    "models for sxts must address the characteristic time scales : ( 1 ) fast rise of the light curves around a few days ; ( 2 ) the subsequent decay with a time scale of the order of one month ; ( 3 ) recurrence times of the order of a few ten years . further , as viscosity is involved in determining the decay , values of the viscosity parameter must be plausible .",
    "for comparison @xmath23 for dwarf novae and related systems for the reaction time of the disk to be @xmath24s ( bath @xmath0 pringle 1981 ) .",
    "there are mainly two types of models for sxts : the disk instability models ( dim )  ( e.g. meyer @xmath0 meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; mineshige @xmath0 wheeler 1989 ; cannizzo 1992 ; cannizzo et al 1995  ( ccl ) ) and the mass transfer instability models ( mti ) ( e.g.  hameury et al 1986 ; 1987 ; 1988 ; 1990 ) .",
    "the basic idea for mti is that the accretion from the secondary star is unstable for a range of accretion rates roughly from @xmath25 g  s@xmath4  to  @xmath26 g  s@xmath4 .",
    "the secondary star expands under the influence of hard x - rays ( @xmath27kev ) from the primary .",
    "the accretion rate exceeds the upper limit of the lower stable range and jumps to an accretion rate greater than the minimum of the higher stable range .",
    "the subsequent burst of mass flow produces the outburst .",
    "the disk becomes thicker and thicker , finally shielding the region around the @xmath28 point .",
    "when the x - ray illumination stops the companion shrinks and the system returns to its quiescent state .",
    "mti models produce the basic characteristics of the light curves and the recurrence times .",
    "the problem with mti is that , according to the model , the hard x - ray flux with @xmath297  kev   must exceed @xmath30@xmath31erg  s@xmath4 in the quiescent state ( hameury et al .",
    "1986 ) while there is no data showing the existence of photons in this energy range with such high luminosities before the outbursts ( tanaka @xmath0 shibazaki  1996 ) .",
    "dims are highly accepted today , although they do not produce a completely self consistent picture explaining all features of sxts .",
    "initially dims were successful in explaining basic characteristics of dwarf novae ( cannizzo 1994 ) .",
    "the model was extended to explain the behavior of sxts which are similar to dwarf novae in some cases .",
    "the disk instability follows a limit cycle mechanism based on an `` s '' shaped surface density @xmath32 versus @xmath33 curve .",
    "upper and lower branches of the `` s '' correspond to hot and cool states respectively .",
    "the middle branch represents an unstable regime .",
    "when  @xmath34 the disk follows the upper branch switching to the lower branch when  @xmath35 .",
    "each radius in the disk has its own `` s '' curve . if the mass transfer satisfies the condition @xmath36@xmath37",
    "@xmath38 @xmath39@xmath40 then the limit cycle mechanism operates through the range between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "if this range of radii covers the entire disk then the whole disk can jump from one stable branch to the other .",
    "accumulation of matter at some radius r may cause mass per unit area @xmath43 to exceed @xmath44 .",
    "viscous dissipation increases suddenly .",
    "waves of surface density propagate to both smaller and larger radii . as a result , the surface density at each radius in the disk exceeds the maximum critical value of the lower branch , and the disk jumps to the hot branch . at the end of this process",
    "the disk finds itself in a high viscosity state . unlike the quiescent state",
    "now the viscous time scale becomes small and matter flows on to the central object . because of the matter flow the densities in the outer regions decrease to below the critical densities .",
    "this causes a cooling front to propagate throughout the disk decreasing the local surface density at each radius to below the local critical values .",
    "propagation of the cooling front means the decay of the outburst ( e.g. , cannizzo 1992 ; lasota et al 1996 ) .",
    "the main difficulty of this model is that the @xmath19 values needed in order to produce recurrence times of around a few ten years are not able to produce the observed amplitude and duration of the outbursts or vice versa  ( for a discussion of the problems see , e.g. lasota 1996 ) .    in this work bsxts",
    "will  be studied with a different approach concentrating on a simple explanation in terms of a disk dynamics model for both rise and the decay pattern of the light curves until the onset of the first mini outburst .",
    "we explore the behavior of the disk following a sudden release of mass in the outer radius in terms of the disk dynamics model of lynden - bell @xmath0 pringle ( 1974 ) ( lp ) . the observations of gs 2000 + 25 and gs / grs 1124 - 68 will be used to illustrate the model .",
    "lp made a study for the evolution of viscous disks in general .",
    "in particular the solution with no central flux is of interest , corresponding to a disk with a black - hole at its center .",
    "the green s function solution of lp take initial density distributions in the form of delta functions in radius .",
    "this is an idealization of an initial mass enhancement in a ring .",
    "convolution of the elementary solution of this green s function model with any initial mass distribution will give the general solution .",
    "initial mass release at a thin ring at the outer radius ( or at a specific radius in the disk ) already corresponds to a solution with a single delta function initial mass distribution .",
    "thus the green s function solution of lp is taken here as the physical solution for the bsxt outbursts .",
    "the motivation leading us to this approach is the similarity between the observed x - ray light curves of the outbursts and the green s function luminosity calculated by lp .",
    "this hypothesis means that a sudden dumping of mass in the outer disk leads to the observed outburst .",
    "the present work applies the model to the data from  gs 2000 + 25  and  gs / grs 1124 - 68 .",
    "the part of the study by lp related to our application is summarized in the appendix . in section 2 data from gs  2000 + 25 and",
    "gs / grs  1124 - 68 are examined with the model .",
    "the aim is to calculate the photon flux from the disk in the observed x - ray band of ginga ( @xmath45kev ) as a function of time using the lp model , and compare this with observed photon flux data taken with the ginga satellite ( provided by s.kitamoto , private communication ) .",

    "this curve is similar to the observed light curves of bsxts .",
    "the similarity is attractive because a mass accumulation at the outer disk may also be represented by a delta function initial mass distribution . if a disk instability causes a transition to a high viscosity state so that the viscous time scale becomes short compared to that in the preoutburst state",
    "then a sudden release of mass would occur .",
    "for such a situation the green s function solution with a delta function initial mass distribution would approximately describe the subsequent evolution of the disk .",

    "the success of the model may indicate that a real disk is effectively represented by the lp model with the artificial choices made here .",

    "next , from @xmath151 where @xmath152 is dimensionless time and @xmath153 is real time , the best fit to the observed photon flux was obtained by adjusting the constant @xmath109 . for gs  2000 + 25",

    "the results are in tables ( 2@xmath24 )    for both sources the fits are applied to the data until the onset of the first mini outburst .",
    "the lp model fits the secular decay in the light curve .",
    "the large @xmath110 values reflect the excursions about the mean secular decay , which the model does not address . figs .",
    "( 1@xmath24 ) show that both models reproduce the average characteristics of the outburst light curves quite well .",
    "the requirement of the model that the kinematic viscosity is independent of time and therefore also of the temperature leads to an @xmath19 parameter which increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "the usual disk instability models require the opposite trend of @xmath19 increasing with increasing temperature .",
    "our time independent viscosity models are artificial and may be considered as an effective representation of real viscosity behavior during the hot states of the accretion disks of bsxts .",
    "empirically the lp models can explain the rise and the decay following the outburst .",
    "our approach here shows that once sudden mass release is triggered at some @xmath55 , for example by a disk instability , the subsequent light curve can be understood as the dynamical evolution of the disk with viscosity .",
    "it seems plausible that the viscosity mechanism must have a temperature dependence at least to start the outbursts .",
    "the success of the model means that the real disk dynamics is insensitive to the temperature dependence of the viscosity , or that a constant effective viscosity lp model is a close approximation to the real luminosity evolution with the integrated effects of variable and temperature dependent viscosity .",
    "to investigate the relation between the lp models and disks with variable viscosity is beyond the scope of the present paper , and is to be considered in subsequent work .",
    "the mass dumped in the outburst is @xmath156  g in all our model fits , for both sources .",
    "this is consistent with accumulation at @xmath157 @xmath158   for recurrence times @xmath159  yrs .",
    "we expect that the mass release is triggered by a disk instability .",
    "the large amounts of mass release @xmath73 imply surface densities @xmath160 g  @xmath161 which are far in excess of the critical ( maximum ) surface density values for disk instability models , _ max=11.4   ^-2  r_10 ^ 1.05  ( ) ^-0.35 ^-0.86 ( shafter at al 1986 ) .",
    "the mass accumulation without triggering an instability then requires small @xmath19 values @xmath162 in the quiescent disk . at such @xmath19",
    "the quiescent disk could be optically thin .",
    "there is no complete picture yet which explains all properties of bsxts , in particular the triggering mechanism for the outbursts which drives the accretion disk from the quiescent state to the outburst and back to the quiescent state . in a recent study by cannizzo et al  ( 1995 )   exponential decay patterns are produced by the disk limit cycle mechanism , but sudden rise of the outbursts and their long recurrence times are not addressed .",
    "the second ( and in two sources , third ) outbursts have rise and decay patterns which can be fitted with exponentials with time constants similar to those of the main outburst .",
    "in addition to this similarity they also pose the problem of understanding the burst repetition time ( augusteijn et al 1993 ; chen et al 1993 ; mineshige 1994 ) .",
    "what is the source of the mass producing the second outburst ? the data following the second mini outburst does not allow a detailed fit with the lp model .",
    "assuming that the amplitude of the burst is proportional to the accumulated mass , @xmath73 , and scaling with the primary outburst we find @xmath73 values are @xmath163 g and @xmath164 g for the second mini outbursts in gs / grs  1124 - 68 and gs  2000 + 25 respectively . using the time interval between the main and the second mini outburst @xmath165 days , we find the extra @xmath166 to supply the @xmath73 of the second mini outburst is @xmath167 g  s@xmath4 for gs / grs  1124 - 68 and @xmath168 g  s@xmath4 for gs  2000 + 25 .",
    "this is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the long term average accretion rate , @xmath47 .",
    "two possibilities may be considered : ( 1 ) all the accumulated mass is not released during the main outburst .",
    "the mass released in the second outburst is `` leftover mass '' and not accumulated between the main outburst and the second outburst .",
    "( 2 ) the mass flow from the companion is enhanced by the x - rays coming from the inner disk in the outburst ; or both possibilities run together .",
    "the x - ray heating of the disk may be important to trigger the mini outbursts whatever the source of the mass creating the second and the third instabilities .",
    "the time between the main and mini outbursts ( @xmath169 few months)must be a characteristic time scale of the `` trigger '' .",
    "the response time scale of the upper atmosphere of the secondary is too short ( @xmath170 @xmath171 s )   ( chen et al 1993 ( clg ) ) while the viscous time scale is of the order of a week .",
    "the shielding of the region around the inner lagrangian point , @xmath28 , has been proposed to explain this time interval ( clg ) .",
    "if the geometrical shielding should end gradually , the abrupt rise of the first mini outburst at a particular time remains unexplained .",
    "two different approaches were proposed by mineshige ( 1994 ) .",
    "an optically thick compton cloud above and below the disk which becomes optically thin in a very short time scale just before the first mini outburst may explain the first mini outburst by the response of the companion to the x - rays coming from the inner disk .",
    "alternatively a second thermal instability would be triggered at the outer disk when the strong x - ray heating of the disk has raised the temperature and decreased the critical density for the trigger sufficiently ( transient recession of the cooling front ) . in the former scenario one still has to explain the secondary mini outburst by invoking a different mechanism . and also exhibits similar rise and decay time scales .",
    "similar time interval and characteristics of all the outbursts seem to imply a unique mechanism responsible for the triggering of the outbursts .",
    "it is well known that simple exponential decays after the outburst maximum describe the data well .",
    "the mini outburst decays can also be fitted with exponential decays with the same time constants as required by the main outburst(fig.5 ) .",
    "however , the fast rise and the exponential decays ( fred ) are put together as separate pieces of the fit rather than being part of a single dynamical model as in the present model .",
    "our lp models fit the main outburst decay quite well .",
    "there is an interesting difference from fred models when it comes to trying to fit the data incorporating the mini outbursts and their decays . in fred models ,",
    "the data stream can be fitted well by a superposition of fred models for the main outburst and the mini outbursts . for our lp model",
    "fits , by contrast , when the fit to the main outburst data is extended past the mini outburst(s ) , it is seen that the model gives a count rate that is greater than the observed count rates , the deviation starting from the onset of the mini outburst . if it is assumed that the ongoing relaxation in the disk after the main outburst is stopped , and the onset of the mini outburst involves an instability that resets the disk to conditions similar to sudden mass release from a local accumulation , then the lp model can be applied to the mini outburst(s ) and their decays .",
    "augusteijn et al ( 1993 ) drew attention to the similarity of the main outburst decay , and the mini outburst decays .",
    "they related this to a feed - back model invoking modulation of the mass transfer from the companion by irradiation from the outburst .",
    "the present approach identifies the similarity with repeated conditions of mass accumulation and release in the disk itself .",
    "the trigger of the mass release could be a disk instability .",
    "the similarity of main outburst and mini outbursts , requires small scale repetitions of the main outburst with similar initial conditions , rather than superposition or convolution with the disk state as evolved from the main outburst s decay .",
    "the presently available data do not allow a detailed fit of the mini outbursts with the lp models .",
    "the behavior of  gs  2000 + 25   and  gs / grs  1124 - 68   are similar to those of a0620 - 00 ,  and gro j0422 + 32 .",
