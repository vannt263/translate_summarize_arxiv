    "these derivatives @xmath40 are the derivatives of order m of the spectrum @xmath41 regarding the energy binning @xmath42 : @xmath43 + this generalization to greater orders of derivatives is given by : @xmath44^{-1}[(1-\\lambda)a^t y+\\lambda d^{(m)t}d^{(m)}x_{n-1 } ]   \\label{e : eqn20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but we have found that the convergence to a stable solution is rather better and faster with a simple function without the @xmath45 derivative , so we decided to restrict our calculation only to order 0 .      three main concerns guided the development of this unfolding iterative method : a fast converging method , a better solution than the classical tykhonov method or than the least square method and the last one , a complete independence of the solution regards to the initial guess .",
    "the iterative tykhonov approach ensures the last concern but not the first two .",
    "so we decided to introduce some accelerating ( focusing ) algorithm between two classical tykhonov iterations .",

    "by the way , this approach converges faster than a classical iterative tykhonov method .",

    "practically , on a dec - compaq alpha workstation working with double precision 64 bits numbers , the resulting estimators are always stable after 300 iterations ( 1 minute of computing time ) and oftenly around 80 iterations , it is already stable .",
    "that is why we decided to put a cut on the maximum number of iterations at 300 .",
    "we also decided to restrict the binning ( in energy and interpolated sphere ) over 64 bins , because working with 32 or 128 bins gives either a too bad energy resolution or a too slow computation , thus 64 seems to be an optimum .",
    "another important aspect of the unfolding is treated without any subtility : positivity @xcite .",
    "of course each bin of the spectrum must have a positive content , on the other case the spectrum would be unphysical .",
    "the positivity is introduced abruptly at each step of the iteration with the following non - linearity : @xmath50 \\label{e : eqn36}\\ ] ]      the statistics fluctuations are estimated with a monte - carlo method . for one set of 11 measurements with the bonner sphere",
    "system,11 uncertainties of these measurements are calculated taking into account the number of observed counts and the duration of the measures .",
    "the propagation through the unfolding process of the statistics fluctuations of the measurements is computed with 100 sets of 64 data @xmath0 , which are interpolated with the spline method from these 11 knots .",
    "the random generation of the 11 knots is performed with a gaussian law centered onto the 11 actual measurements and with a standard deviation corresponding to the error bars directly measured with the instrument .",
    "the unfolding of the 100 data sets @xmath0 gives 100 @xmath51 estimators of the neutron spectrum .",
    "the fluctuations of the 100 spectra @xmath11 correspond to the propagation of the statistics fluctuations through the unfolding process .",
    "@xmath52 also , to the 100 @xmath53 spectra correspond 100 reconstructed measurements @xmath54 .",
    "the reconstructed measurements @xmath55 are reinjected into the unfolding process giving new estimators of the spectra @xmath56 and twice reconstructed measurements @xmath57 .",
    "the average of the absolute difference of the old and of the new spectra gives the systematics errors of the unfolding spectra : @xmath58 these two calculations of uncertainties are performed with 100 samples of monte - carlo generated data sets ; this figure seems low due to the signal to noise ratio of 10 % , nevertheless the precision is sufficient for our purpose and moreover it is highly time consuming and we can not afford greater computation . also some tricks are used to avoid spending too much time recalculating 100 times almost the same things .",
    "of course the @xmath18 and @xmath59 parameters minimizations are very expensive on the cpu time balance , so the evolution with the iterations of the @xmath60 ( for example ) is memorized during the first pass , while for the next passes the minimization of the @xmath18 parameter is performed at the @xmath61 iteration in the neighboorhood of the @xmath62 first evaluation .",
    "another trick is used , oftenly after 50 or 80 iterations the @xmath63 and @xmath64 figures are stables due to the precision of the computation , so each successive iteration appears as an identity operator , then at this moment the iterative process is stopped .",
    "this kind of unfolding method shows several advantages .",
    "the most important one is the independance of the final solution regarding the initial guess .",
    "thus any distribution can be used as an initial guess .",
    "we have tested several different initial guesses : random numbers , flat functions @xmath65 and the intercorrelation product between the response @xmath0 and the discrete response functions of matrix @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 the strong point of this method is that using all these different initial guesses the iterative approach converges to exactly the same result . for a reason of fast and easy computation",
    ", we decided to use a flat initial guess : @xmath65 .",
    "to circonvene the problem of the minimization with @xmath18 of the @xmath68 criteria , we used different technics in order to maintain a high precision on the real @xmath18 and a reasonable time of calculation for each iteration .",
    "the minimization of the criteria is performed in different ways to optimize this calculation time .",
    "firstly , a multiple step scanning and secondly , a dichotomy algorithm are performed .",
    "the first solution of the first set @xmath0 is calculated carefully , while the other solutions computed to estimate the systematic and the statistic uncertainties , does begin their minimization at each step , with initial figures in the neighborhood of the first @xmath62 sequence calculated previously .",
    "of course , at this point the focusing on the right @xmath18 is performed with scanning and dichotomy algorithms but with less steps , that avoid to spoil too much computation time .",
    "to illustrate this unfolding technics , we presents two examples of unfolding : the first one is a thermal neutron spectrum , the second one is a 565 kev mono - energetic neutron spectrum .",
    "this thermal neutron spectrum is produced near the sigma facility at ( irsn - cadarache ) , it consists of an assembling of several ambe neutron sources surrounded by some graphite shielding .",
    "the expected spectrum is an heavy thermal component with some residual peaks between 1 and 3 mev .",
    "figures 1.a and 1.b shows precisely what was expected : a huge thermal neutron part and a small high energy component that goes from 100 kev up to 10 mev .",
    "if the lower limit is physically explainable due to the tail of the decelarated neutrons from the high energy peaks , the upper bound around 10 mev is not realistic and it is just due to the intrinsic resolution of the bonner sphere method itself . while figure 1.a shows the statistics error bars , figure 1.b presents the systematics unfolding error bars ; in both case they are extremely tiny : the global statistics uncertainties is 0.11% while the global systematics errors of the unfolding is 3.6% .",
    "these very small uncertainties are mainly due to the very high number of counts registered for most of the sphere , this can be seen on figure 1.c , which represents the measured counts on the various sphere , ( plain line ) , while the dot line corresponds to the recalculated spectrum after unfolding .",
    "these two shapes are in perfect agreement together .",
    "the last figures , shows one of the very specific parameter of the evolution of the unfolding process : @xmath69 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath70 @xmath71 .",
    "this shows that after only 20 iterations this parameter is already very low @xmath72 , that means that the iterative operator is very closed to the identity operator , and the current solution is very closed to the final solution .",
    "this shape is very easy to unfold , this is why after only 78 iterations , the unfolding process is over .",
    "the main aspect of this unfolding is its ability to reveal some realistic details of the shape here a double structured shape with confortable uncertainties .",
    "the bonner sphere system was operated in the beam of a van de graaf accelerator producing 565 kev mono - energetic neutrons at cea ( bruyres le chtel ) .",
    "the expected spectrum is a single energy peak enlarged by the energy resolution of the device eventually surrounded by some low energy diffused neutrons .",
    "the background of the low energy diffused neutrons is substracted from the measurements thanks to other measures undertook with copper - polyethylene shadow cones between the target that produces the neutrons and the detector .",
    "figure 2c shows a light discrepancy between the measurements and the reconstructed data for the values between the 4 and the 7 inches spheres ; this is probably due to the various efficiencies of the shadowing cones for small and big spheres .",
    "anyway the global discrepancy between these two curves is 1.2 @xmath73 .",
    "anywhere else , for the right and left wings , the reconstructed distribution is in good agreement with the original data .",
    "the unfolded spectrum ( fig 2a and 2b ) , clearly shows a mono - energetic spectrum with a mean peaked at 686 kev .",
    "the difference between 565 kev and 686 kev can be partly explained by the large binning used for these energies because of the logarithmic progression of the bins in order to cover a wide energy spectrum of nine decades . also the low energy resolution originated in the response matrix can be invoked to explain this discrepancy and finally too a systematic bias of about 40 kev from the energy calibration of this van de graaf generator .",
    "the shape of this spectrum is obviously peaked even if the fwhm is quite large : 726 kev .",
    "the global statistics errors represents 19 .",
    "% of the unfolding spectrum ( see figure 2a ) while the systematics errors cover 28.8 % ( see figure 2b ) ; even if these two figures are quite large , this kind of spectrum estimation is sufficient enough for radioprotection purposes .",
    "these large values of uncertainties are probably due to the low counting rates compared to the thermal neutron measurement and also to the bad signal to background ratio for direct and diffused neutrons measures .",
    "figure 2d illustrates the high speed of the unfolding process : after only 97 iterations , the stability is obtained .",
    "the progress of the minimization criteria @xmath12 for the unfolding of the thermal neutron from sigma is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the @xmath12 _ vs. _ @xmath18 function is drawn after 1 , 2 , 3 and finally 78 iterations .",
    "the evolution of this minimizing criteria is very fast .",
    "after the first iteration a wide minimum can be seen , while after the second iteration it is already very faint and extremly closed to 1 . with the evolution of the iteration number the value of this minimum",
    "get smaller and smaller and also closer to 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is always @xmath75 this explains why the @xmath18 minimum is very closed to 1 but never equals 1 .",
    "so for the last iteration before stability , i=78 , we find @xmath76 .",
    "this kind of unfolding scenario is typical of the cases we have studied , and also the order of magnitude of the last value of @xmath76 .",
    "if we consider into details the unfolded spectrum from the sigma installation , we can be puzzled by the anomalous behaviour of this spectrum in the range @xmath77 .",
    "normally , the curve should look like a maxwellian distribution with a temperature of 300k .",
    "@xmath78 instead of this behaviour , the neutron spectrum distribution seems to rise very strightly at low energies without exhibiting a maximum around 25 mev .",
    "three explanations can be argued for this fact .",
    "first of all , the low energy cut of the matrix response and of the unfolded spectrum is put at 10 mev @xmath79 which should distort a little bit this low energy region behaviour of thermal spectra .",
    "the main reason of this artificial cut at 10 mev is due to the very bad uncertainties of the response functions of the bonner sphere system to very low energy neutrons produced by the mcnp monte - carlo program in the range 1mev - 10 mev .",
    "so , very large statistical error bars are obtained through this method at 1 mev ( bigger than 20% ) .",
    "this bad quality of results produced by mcnp for low energies neutrons is originated by the importance of the kinetic effect that polyethylen for example can generate through thermal exchanges between the molecules of polyethylene , whose agitation and binding energy are greater than 22 mev , and the impinging neutrons of very low energy 1 mev .",
    "thus , these very cold neutrons are heated by the brownian motion of the molecules of the detector and a good deal of these neutrons do not penetrate inside the detector but are preferentially bouncing at the first contact with the surface of the sphere .",
    "this explanation is also at the origin of the discontinuities observed on the matrix response while the diameter of the spheres varies between the bare detector and the first 3 inches sphere for energies lower than 1 ev ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the bouncing neutrons , due to thermal exchange between them and polyethylene explains the reheating and freezing neutrons between 1 mev and 1 ev .",
    "it produces for the spheres of diameter ranging between 1.3 to 2.5 inches at some energies an enhancement of the detector s efficiency and a reduction at other energies ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "this last point brings serious consequences while big discontinuities appears at low energies for small spheres between naked counter and the 3 inch sphere : we are not allowed to perform an interpolation of the measured data for hypothetical spheres in the range of the bare detector up to the 3 inch sphere .",
    "( note : diameter of the naked counter = 1.29 inch ) this is equivalent to say that the measurement function is not smooth enough for spheres with diameters lower than 3 inches to authorize a direct interpolation .",
    "a solution would be to perform some more measurements with spheres of lower diameters than 3 inches , but due to these heavy discontinuities , small variations in diameter ( less than 1 mm ) on the polyethylene thickness should generate strong variations on the neutron s rates .",
    "we propose an alternative solution to this problem : in most of the actual cases , the low energy spectrum follows a maxwellian distribution ; the very rare cases where this assumption is wrong are very few and are well known situations as for example : a specific low energy neutrons filtered beam produced with a nuclear reactor adapted to solid state physics and cristallography . in other words , guessing a maxwellian distribution is a low cost , extremly realistic and highly efficient assumption for low energies neutrons encoutered in actual radioprotection situations .",
    "so we performed an interpolation of the measurements for the spheres between 2.9 inches up to 12 inches , while we generated for a pure maxwellian distribution response of the spheres lower than 1.9 inches down to the naked counter , matching the data measured with this bare counter and its response to this pure maxwellian distribution .",
    "for the hypothetical spheres between 1.9 and 2.9 inches , we performed a linear transition to connect these two curves of reconstructed measurements versus diameters of the spheres .",
    "unfolding with this method the sigma spectrum shows a satisfying solution regards to the maxwellian distribution .",
    "the price to pay is a loss of continuity between the thermal and the epithermal parts of the unfolded spectrum .",
    "anyway , the epithermal part is rather small compared to the pure thermal part and secondly the incidence of this epithermal part is rather small on the total dose flux measurement , because it deals with few neutrons ranging between 1 and 100 ev .",
    "the interesting point of this method is that it does nt affect at all the unfoldings of greater energies neutrons spectra , for example the 565 kev neutrons monoenergetic spectrum is absolutely unchanged !      using the rectification of the interpolation method with a maxwellian distribution forcing for the thermal part of the spectra , onto a real data set from the sigma thermal neutron facility , am - be sources + graphite moderator ( see figure 6c ) .",
    "we obtain a very interesting neutron unfolded spectrum which exhibits a clear maxwellian distribution for thermal neutrons of energy below @xmath80 , a high energy part of the spectrum for neutrons ranging from 1mev up to 10 mev corresponding to direct neutrons produced in the am - be source ( see figure 6a ) .",
    "between 10 and 100 ev @xmath81 , we can find an enhanced epithermal band , that seems to be disconnected from the maxwellian thermal distribution .",
    "here is the price to pay for this linear combination of two method of data interpolation ( spline+maxwellian forcing ) for the small diameters sphere countings.anyway , this small epithermal band is not of a very importance for the dose flux calculation .",
    "also , the global statistics errors remains very low : @xmath82 , compared to @xmath83 previously(see figure 6a ) . while the global systematics errors is slightly increased from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ( see figure 6b ) .",
    "we can see that the final distribution is obtained after 85 iterations with a minimizing parameter @xmath69 less than @xmath86 .",
    "the modification of the interpolation gives more realistic results when the original approach shows a small deficience due to discontinuities while interpolated .",
    "fortunately we have a very good knowledge , thanks to the thermodynamic of the standard thermal distribution of low energies neutrons .",
    "the development of this unfolding iterative tykhonov approach was leaded by three important requirements : a high efficiency and fast converging method , a better and faster convergency than the least square method or than the classical tykhonov method , but with the stability of the solution toward fluctuations of the measurements produced by the tykhonov approach and also , a complete unsensitivity of the solution with respect to the initial guess .",
    "the iterated tykhonov unfolding approach is modified to ensure a good convergence with a parameter running between 0 and 1 .",
    "an accelerating algorithm is introduced between two classical tykhonov iterations , this algorithm looks like a gradient method with a least square term .",
    "the calculation of statistics and systematics uncertainties is studied in details .",
    "the efficiency of this approach is presented in two experimental neutron spectrum unfoldings .",
    "this method is fully dedicated to bonner sphere system unfolding . due to its very wide energy coverage ,",
    "the bonner sphere system is a very usefull device for radioprotection evaluation , but it can not be used as a high resolution neutron spectrum instrument for metrology , even with an excellent unfolding method !",
    "one of the very big advantages of the method here illustrated is that no a priori information is introduced during the unfolding process leading to coherent results with the expected spectra .",
    "this independance toward the initial guess is extremely important for radioprotection measurement when a - priori no information on the neutron spectrum is available ; not observing this point should lead to very prejudiciable wrong evaluations of dose flux calculation which is not allowed for radioprotection expertise approach .",
    "nevertheless a very slight stretch to this law is applied in such a way that the interpolated counting rates between naked counter and the first 3 inches sphere is assumed to correspond to a pure maxwellian distribution for the thermal neutrons part .",
    "this rectification is done to prevent from the high discontinuities of the matrix response for low diameters and low energies .",
    "this type of unfolding gives realistic results for thermal neutrons without modifying the high energies neutron spectra .",
