    "the study of equivalence of ensembles that describe systems in thermodynamic equilibrium , the gibbs ensembles , has a long tradition in statistical mechanics .",
    "thermodynamic properties evaluated in distinct ensembles will be the same if they are equivalent . in the case of equilibrium systems ,",
    "the ensembles are set up according to well known prescriptions that take account the existence of a hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the possibility of representing nonequilibrium systems in distinct ensembles was first considered by ziff and brosillow @xcite when they used the constant coverage ensemble to study first - order transitions in a catalytic reaction model @xcite , originally defined in the ensemble of constant rate .",
    "afterwards , tom and de oliveira @xcite introduced the conserved contact process , a version of the contact process @xcite in the ensemble of constant particle number .",
    "the equivalence between the constant rate and constant particle number ensembles for the contact process in the stationary regime has been proved by hilhorst and van wijland in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "later on , the equivalence of ensembles in the stationary regime was extended for other systems with short - range interactions with distinct annihilation dynamics @xcite .    in equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , the equivalence of ensembles is granted for homogeneous and extensive systems in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . on the other hand , for non - extensive systems ,",
    "the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are not equivalent @xcite .",
    "examples of physical problems in which canonical and microcanonical ensembles are not equivalent are nuclei , atomic clusters in which the range of forces between their constituents are comparable to the system size , systems at the first - order transition with phase separation @xcite and models with long - range forces @xcite . in particular , this latter set of problems has deserved a great interest not only in statistical mechanics , but also in other areas , such as nuclear physics , astrophysics @xcite and plasma physics @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium systems with long - range interactions have also been proposed and in this case , we may ask whether the equivalence of ensembles may be valid for such systems .    in the context of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , systems displaying long - range interactions",
    "have been proposed originally as more realistic models describing the spreading processes , instead of short - range systems . in particular , an anomalous model of the directed percolation",
    "has been proposed by mollison @xcite . in this problem ,",
    "the infection probability performs a _ lvy flight _ decaying with the distance @xmath0 as a power - law relation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spatial dimension of the system and @xmath3 is control parameter .",
    "the critical behavior of anomalous directed percolation displays a family of universality classes that have been studied by grassberger @xcite , by janssen et al @xcite who have considered field - theoretic renormalization group , by hinrichsen and howard @xcite who performed numerical simulations and recently by tessone et al @xcite who analyzed a class of spatially extended chaotic systems with power - law decaying interactions . in all cases above",
    ", the critical exponents vary continuously with the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , another class of nonequilibrium systems with long - range interactions , named contact processes with long - range interactions , have been introduced by ginelli et al .",
    "@xcite , inspired by pinning - depinning transitions in nonequilibrium wetting phenomena . by varying the control parameters , the contact process with long - range interactions exhibits a richer phase diagram than the usual short - range contact process , with distinct universality classes @xcite and discontinuous phase transitions @xcite .",
    "two aims concern us in this paper .",
    "first , we wish to analyze the equivalence of ensembles in nonequilibrium systems with long - range interactions .",
    "the equivalence of ensembles has been studied in systems with short - range interactions @xcite , _ but not _ in systems with long - range interactions .",
    "we will consider here the @xmath4contact process with long - range interactions , introduced by ginelli et al @xcite .",
    "second , we wish to show that the present approach offers a new procedure for analyzing first - order transitions of systems with absorbing states . due to the existence of the absorbing states",
    ", standard procedures used successfully in the study of discontinuous equilibrium phase transitions may not work well when applied to describe nonequilibrium first - order transitions . in the present case",
    ", the first evidence for a discontinuous transition will be given by the presence of `` loops '' in the rate versus density curve , as long as the system is finite .",
    "as it will be shown , the loops disappear in the thermodynamic limit giving rise to a tie line , the true signature of a first - order transition .",
    "another advantage of using the present approach is verified when one analyzes the system at the emergence of the phase transition , since the nature of the phase transition can be inferred simply by examinating the structure of particles . as we shall see , if",
    ", at the emergence of the transition , the cluster is fractal , the transition will be continuous ; if the cluster is compact , the transition will be discontinuous .",
    "a compact cluster provides us an evidence of a discontinuous transition .",
    "the one dimensional @xmath4contact process with long - range interactions @xcite is defined in a chain of @xmath5 sites with periodic boundary conditions as follows .",
    "to each site @xmath6 of a one - dimensional lattice is attached an occupation variable @xmath7 that takes the values 0 or 1 according whether the site @xmath6 is empty or occupied by a particle , respectively .",
    "the process is composed of spontaneous annihilation of a single particle ( @xmath8 ) and catalytic creation of a particle ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "particles are created only in empty sites in which at least one of its nearest neighbor sites is occupied by a particle .",
    "these empty sites are named _ active sites_. the rate of creation depends on the length of the island of empty sites next to the active site and decreases algebraically with the size of the island , introducing an effective long - range interaction . the total transition rate @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a parameter and @xmath13 describes a spontaneous annihilation and @xmath14 @xmath15 describes a catalytic creation that depends on the length @xmath16 of the island of empty sites , where @xmath17 and @xmath3 are parameters and we have considered the shorthand notation @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath19 one recovers the original short - range contact process @xcite .    here , numerical simulations in the constant rate ensemble is performed as follows .",
    "a particle is chosen at random from a list of occupied sites .",
    "it is annihilated with probability @xmath20 . with probability @xmath21",
    ", a new particle may be created next to the chosen particle .",
    "this is done by choosing first one of its two nearest neighbors with equal probability and then a particle will be actually created with probability @xmath22 provided the chosen site is empty .",
    "this algorithm gives the following ratio between the creation and annihilation of particles @xmath23 , which is equivalent to that considered by ginelli et al @xcite , in which the creation and annihilation of particles occur with rates @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively as long as @xmath12 is related to @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "the increment of the time is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the number of occupied sites .",
    "for large values of @xmath12 , the system is constrained into the absorbing state , in which no particles are allowed to be created .",
    "decreasing the parameter @xmath12 , a phase transition to an active state takes place , whose location depends on the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath3 . for a fixed value of @xmath17",
    "( we take here to be @xmath30 , as considered by ginelli et al .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath31 the transition is continuous with critical exponents belonging to direct percolation ( dp ) universality class . for @xmath32",
    "the transition becomes discontinuous .",
    "ginelli et al @xcite found that , the crossover between the discontinuous and second - order phase transitions occurs at @xmath33 .      in the constant particle number ensemble ,",
    "the control parameter is the total particle number @xmath34 .",
    "again we used a chain with @xmath5 sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "particles are neither created nor annihilated .",
    "instead , a particle leaves their place and jump to an empty site .",
    "however , the jump process is not unrestrictive process , since their occurrence must be consistent with the rules of their version in the constant rate ensemble .",
    "more specifically , the dynamics that characterizes this ensemble is defined as follows .",
    "a particle of the system , chosen at random , leaves its place , located for example at the site @xmath6 , and jumps to an empty site placed at the site @xmath35 , also chosen at random .",
    "the jump rate will depend on the specific rule of the considered model .",
    "one may define the jump process by a dynamics in which both creation and annihilation occurs simultaneously , according to the transition rate @xmath36 is given by @xcite @xmath37 to see that this transition rate leads to a dynamic that is equivalent to that given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) let us consider the total rate @xmath38 in which particles jump to site @xmath35 . in the thermodynamic limit the system size @xmath39 and the sum @xmath40 approaches @xmath41 , by the law of large numbers ,",
    "so that @xmath42 . by an analogous argument the total rate in which particles leave the site @xmath6 is @xmath43 . comparing with the eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the averages @xmath44 and @xmath45 should be proportional to @xmath25 and @xmath12 , respectively , thus @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by eqs .",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the density of particles .",
    "this formula allow us to evaluate the parameter @xmath51 within respect to the ensemble of constant particle number .",
    "the average @xmath52 can be understood as `` density of active sites '' , that is , the density of empty sites in which particles may jump to them .",
    "it can be evaluated directly from numerical simulations by computing eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) that is zero and @xmath53 according whether the site @xmath6 is occupied or empty , respectively , where @xmath16 is the length of the island of inactive sites in which the active site is located . for time - dependent regime , however , eq . ( [ eq5 ] ) might not always hold .",
    "for instance , if the initial state is such that averages @xmath52 and @xmath41 are not constants , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) can not be satisfied @xcite .",
    "the actual numerical simulation of the constant particle number ensemble is realized as follows .",
    "an empty site surrounded by at least one particle ( active site ) is chosen at random .",
    "next , a particle of the system , also chosen at random , jumps to the active site with probability @xmath54 .",
    "the constant factor @xmath55 is used in order to guarantee that @xmath56 , since @xmath57 may be greater than @xmath25 . in the constant rate ensemble , the control parameter",
    "may be included in the probability of choosing each subprocess ( creation or annihilation ) .",
    "however , in the present case , as both processes occur simultaneously and the parameter @xmath58 is not constant , this procedure is not possible .",
    "in contrast to the constant rate ensemble , the conserved contact process does not have , strictly speaking , an absorbing state .",
    "this fact constitutes an useful tool in the study of phase transitions because there is no danger of falling into the absorbing state as happens in numerical simulations of the constant rate ensemble . in the conserved ensemble ( constant particle number ensemble )",
    "the equivalent of the absorbing state is the state with zero density , as is the case of an infinite system with a finite number of particles , also named subcritical regime .",
    "the first analysis we have performed here consists of studying the @xmath4contact process by means of cluster approximations .",
    "we will consider here approximations at the level of one and two sites .    at the level of one - site approximation",
    ", we use the following approximation for the probability of a string of sites : @xmath59 in this case , it suffices to consider the dynamic variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the steady state",
    ", one has the following relation @xmath62 this equation has already been obtained by ginelli et al @xcite . for @xmath32 , eq .",
    "( [ eqmf ] ) establishes a discontinuous transition between an absorbing and an active state that can be viewed by the existence of `` loops '' @xcite .",
    "as it will be seen later , numerical simulations in the constant particle number ensemble also presents `` loops '' for finite systems in the interval @xmath32 .",
    "however , eq . ( [ eqmf ] ) also exhibits loops for @xmath31 , in contrast to numerical simulations .    in order to obtain improved results ,",
    "we have derived relations by considering correlations of two sites . in this case",
    ", the probability of a string of sites is approximated by @xmath63 the dynamic variables are now @xmath64 and nearest - neighbor joint probabilities @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "only two of them are independent , so that it is necessary to write down two equations . by solving these equations numerically",
    ", we find the behavior of @xmath12 versus @xmath67 for several values of @xmath3 , as showed in fig [ fig1a ] .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , two - site approximations supports a change in the nature of the phase transition by increasing the parameter @xmath3 , passing from first - order to second - order at @xmath68 .",
    "this can be identified by disappearance of loops .",
    "although the results obtained from two - site approximations agree qualitatively with numerical simulations , the location of the transition points as well as the value of @xmath3 that characterizes the crossover between first - order and second - order transitions are incorrect .",
    "numerical simulations of the @xmath4contact process were performed for @xmath30 and several values of @xmath3 .",
    "we have used @xmath69 monte carlo steps to evaluate the appropriate quantities , after discarding a sufficient number of steps to reach the stationary state .",
    "here one monte carlo step corresponds to @xmath34 jumping processes . in order to compare results obtained from distinct ensembles",
    "we have simulated the contact process with long - range interactions not only in the constant particle number ensemble , but also in the constant rate ensemble .",

    "in this situation the density of particles vanishes and the system is constrained to remain in the subcritical regime .",

    "if a particle never reaches the border , the system size may be taken as infinite .",
    "the size of the system was chosen to be big enough , so that no particles have reached the border for the maximum time considered .",
