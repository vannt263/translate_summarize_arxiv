    "let us study a physical process during a fixed time .",
    "the estimations of the average number of signal events which indicate new phenomenon ( @xmath3 ) and of the average number of background events ( @xmath4 ) in the experiment are given .",
    "we suppose that the events have the poisson distributions with the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , i.e. the random variable @xmath11 describes the signal events and the random variable @xmath12 describes the background events .",
    "say we observed @xmath5 events  the realization of the studying process @xmath13 ( @xmath5 is the sum of signal and background events in the experiment ) .",
    "here @xmath3 , @xmath4 are non - negative real numbers and @xmath5 is an integer . the classical frequentist methods of testing a precise hypothesis allow one to construct a rejection region and determine associated error probabilities for the following `` simple '' hypotheses :    @xmath14 versus @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the probability density functions ( p.d.f.s ) + @xmath18 for the case of presence and @xmath19 + for the case of absence of signal events in the universe population .    in fig.1 the p.d.f.s @xmath20  ( a ) and @xmath21  ( b ) for the case @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xcite , table.13 , cut 6 ) are shown . as is seen the intersection of these p.d.f.s takes place .",
    "let us denote the threshold ( critical value ) that divides the abscissa in fig.1 into the rejection region and the area of accepted hypothesis @xmath24 via @xmath25 .",
    "the incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis @xmath24 , the type i error ( the statement that phenomenon is absent , but it is present ) , has the probability @xmath26 , and the incorrect acceptance of @xmath24 , the type ii error ( the statement that phenomenon exists , but it is absent ) , has the probability @xmath27 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath29 on the value of @xmath25 for above example is presented in fig.2 .",
    "in this section we show the procedure of the rejection region construction for the likelihood ratio  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the likelihood ratio of @xmath24 to @xmath31 in the area of existing @xmath32 .",
    "the decision to either reject or accept @xmath24 will depend on the observed value of @xmath33 , where small values of @xmath33 correspond to the rejection of @xmath24 .",
    "for the traditional frequentist the classical most powerful test of the simple hypothesis is determined by some critical value @xmath34 such that    if @xmath35 , reject @xmath24 ,    if @xmath36 , accept @xmath24 .    in compliance with this test , the frequentist reports type i and type ii error probabilities as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are cumulative density functions of @xmath32 under @xmath24 and @xmath31 , respectively . for a conventional equal - tailed test with @xmath41 , the critical value @xmath34 satisfies @xmath42 .    in the same way we can construct the rejection region ,",
    "find the critical values @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the statistics @xmath46 ( for `` significance '' @xmath9 ) , @xmath47 ( for `` significance '' @xmath10 ) and @xmath48 ( for `` significance '' @xmath49 ) .",
    "here , the value of @xmath50 is the estimation of the number of signal events .",
    "note that `` significance '' @xmath49 depends on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , namely , @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the probability density functions of statistics under consideration can be obtained in an analytical form . another way to obtain the p.d.f .",
    "is the calculations by a monte carlo simulation of the results of a large number of experiments ( see as an example @xcite ) for the given values @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in this study",
    "we use the latter approach .",
    "the p.d.f.s for @xmath22 and @xmath23 obtained by this way are shown in fig.3 ( these distributions are the result of @xmath52 simulation experiments for random variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "the difference between these p.d.f.s and p.d.f.s resulting from direct calculations of the probabilities ( fig.1 ) is extremely small .    in fig.4",
    "the p.d.f.s of statistic @xmath55 for the case of @xmath56 , @xmath57  ( a ) and the case of @xmath58 , @xmath57  ( b ) are shown .",
    "the behaviour of probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath29 versus the critical value @xmath44 for the statistic @xmath55 is also presented in fig.4  ( c ) .    it is worth to stress that this approach allows one to construct the p.d.f.s and , correspondingly , the acceptance and the rejection regions for complicated statistics with account for the systematic errors and the uncertainties in @xmath4 and @xmath3 estimations .",
    "we compare the statistic @xmath59 , the statistic @xmath55 , the statistic @xmath60 and the likelihood ratio ( @xmath61 in our case ) .",
    "the reason for the comparison is the existence of a opinion that the value of such type statistic @xmath62 characterizes the difference between the samples with and without signal events in terms of `` standard deviations '' ( @xmath63 )   is the standard normal distribution , then the @xmath64 deviation from 0 corresponds the area of tail that is equal to @xmath65 , @xmath66  ",
    "@xmath67 , @xmath68    @xmath69 , @xmath70  ",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72  ",
    "@xmath73 . ] . to anticipate a little , the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 corresponding to these `` standard deviations '' depend on the value of the sample and for @xmath9 , for example , @xmath28 and @xmath29 have a perceptible value even if @xmath3 and @xmath4 satisfy the condition @xmath74 .",
    "the type i error @xmath28 is also called a significance level of the test . the value for @xmath29",
    "is meaningful only when it is related to an alternative hypothesis @xmath31 .",
    "the dependence @xmath75 is referred to as a power function that allows one to choose a preferable statistic for the hypothesis testing .",
    "it means that for the specified significance level we can determine the critical value @xmath34 ( correspondingly , @xmath76 and find the power @xmath75 of this criterion .",
    "the greater the value @xmath75 , the better statistic separates hypotheses for the specified value of @xmath28 .    in table 1",
    "the comparison result is shown . for several values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( significance level @xmath77 )   and @xmath78",
    "are performed . ]   the critical values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath34 and the corresponding values of power @xmath75 of these criteria for the statistics @xmath59 , @xmath55 , @xmath60 and the likelihood ratio are presented . as is seen from table  i",
    "there is no visible difference in the power values for the considered statistics , i.e. we can use in an equivalent manner either of these statistics for the hypotheses testing .",
    ".the comparison of power of criteria for different statistics .",
    "the values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath34 are the critical values of statistics @xmath59 , @xmath55 , @xmath60 and likelihood ratio for @xmath79 .",
    "the values @xmath75 are the power for corresponding critical values . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     right column in tables 2 , 3 and 4 contains the value of probability @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath80 is a characteristic of the observability of phenomenon for the given @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , it is the fraction of p.d.f .",
    "@xmath20 for statistic @xmath5 that can be described by the fluctuation of background in case of the absence of phenomenon .",
    "the value of @xmath80 equals the area of intersection of probability density functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "clearly , if we superimpose the p.d.f.s @xmath20 and @xmath21 and choose the intersection point of curves ( point @xmath81 $ ] ) as a critical value for the hypotheses testing   ( in our case conditions @xmath82 and @xmath83 are performed ) . by this",
    "is meant that this checking can be named as the equal probability test . of course , if we use the hypotheses testing we can also determine @xmath25 having found the minimum of the sum of @xmath28 and @xmath29 or having found the minimum of the sum of weighted @xmath28 and @xmath29 or having exploited any other condition in accordance with the requirements of experiment",
    ". the @xmath80 may be thought of as independing of these requirements . ]",
    ", we have @xmath84 .",
    "as is seen from tables 2 , 3 and 4 the value of @xmath80 is also close to the sum @xmath85 determined by using the equal - tailed test .",
    "the accuracy of determination of the critical value by monte carlo calculations depends on the number of monte carlo trials and on the level of significance defined by the critical value . to illustrate",
    ", fig.7 shows the distribution of the estimations of the value @xmath86 for the case @xmath87 , @xmath88 and for the @xmath52 monte carlo trials in each estimation ( equal - tailed test is used ) .",
    "the result obtained via the direct calculations of p.d.f.s is also shown in this figure .",
    "thus , this method is accurate enough to give reliable results for estimation of the discovery potential of the experiment .",
    "the approach to the determination of the critical region in the hypotheses testing by monte carlo calculation of p.d.f.s can be used to estimate the integrated luminosity which is necessary for detection the predicted effects with sufficient accuracy . in fig.8  ( a ) the dependence of @xmath25 on integrated luminosity ( @xcite , table.12 , cut.5 , @xmath89 ) is shown .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are presented in fig.8  ( b ) . as evident from figure",
    "the integrated luminosity @xmath90 is sufficient to detect sleptons under the requirement that the probability @xmath91 less than  @xmath92 .      in this paper",
    "the discussion on the observation of new phenomenon is restricted to the testing of simple hypotheses in case of the predicted values @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the observed value @xmath5 . as is stressed in @xcite ,",
    "the precise hypothesis testing should not be done by forming a traditional confidence interval and simply checking whether or not the precise hypothesis is compatible with the confidence interval .",
    "a confidence interval @xcite is usually of considerable importance in determining where the unknown parameter is likely to be , given that the alternative hypothesis is true , but it is not useful in determining whether or not a precise null hypothesis is true .    to compare several statistics used for the hypotheses testing , we employ the method that allows one to construct the rejection regions via the determination the probability density functions of these statistics by monte carlo calculations .",
    "as is shown , the considered statistics have close values of power for the specified significance level and can be used for the hypotheses testing in an equivalent manner .",
    "also , it has been shown that the estimations of type i and type ii errors obtained by this method have a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the method was used to make the inferences on the observability of some predicted phenomena .",
    "we are indebted to m.dittmar for useful discussions which were one of the motivations to perform this study .",
    "we are grateful to v.a.matveev , v.f.obraztsov and v.l.solovianov for the interest and valuable comments .",
