    "also the window of densities in the op phase shrinks as @xmath70 increases .",

    "they explain the fact that the spin polarization is partial as a finite - temperature effect . recall that at zero temperature ,",
    "this transition is of first order and is predicted to occur between @xmath109 ( ref . ) and @xmath110 ( ref .  ) .",
    "however , this contradicts the theoretical finding of dharma - wardana and perrot , @xcite in the sense that partial spin polarization due to the exchange happens for @xmath111 between 0.3 and 1.6 , i.e. ,  well above @xmath112 as reported by ghosh _",
    "et al_.    our theory supports the interpretation of the experiment of ghosh _ et al . _",
    "based on an exchange - driven spin - polarized ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "we explain the partial spin polarization in terms of the rashba interaction rather than in terms of finite temperature .",

[ fig1 ] for low @xmath85 .",

    "we present a phase diagram where two competing quantum phases are identified , one of which shares the rashba single - particle orbitals , with their ip spin quantization axis , and another one which has a finite component of the spin in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this phase possesses a partial spin polarization and exists within a window of densities , suggesting that a combination of exchange and rashba spin - orbit interaction may qualitatively explain experimental results obtained in gaas - algaas heterostructures at low electron density .                                    more precisely , the circular symmetry of the dispersion relation requires that @xmath113 where @xmath114 is an integer and @xmath115 is an arbitrary function .",

    "the @xmath88 dependence of @xmath89 may be summarized as follows : ( i ) in the op phase @xmath98 because only the lower branch is occupied , ( ii ) in the ip phase at high density , on the contrary , for given @xmath70 , @xmath89 decreases monotonically as @xmath88 increases due to the occupancy of both branches , and ( iii ) @xmath89 increases monotonically in the ip phase at low density since only the lower branch is occupied and @xmath121 when @xmath88 increases .",
