    "the goal of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite is to allow two distant parties , alice and bob , to share a common string of secret ( known as the key ) , in the presence of an eavesdropper , eve . unlike conventional cryptography",
    ", qkd promises perfect security based on the fundamental laws of physics . proving the unconditional security of qkd is a hard problem .",
    "fortunately , this problem has recently been solved @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "experimental qkd has been successfully demonstrated over 100 km of commercial telecom fibers @xcite and commercial qkd systems are already on the market .",
    "the most important question of qkd is its security .",
    "real - life qkd systems are often based on attenuated laser pulses ( i.e. , weak coherent states ) , which occasionally give out more than one photon .",
    "this opens up the possibility of sophisticated eavesdropping attacks such as a photon number splitting attack , where eve stops all single - photon signals and splits multi - photon signals , keeping one copy herself and re - sending the rest to bob .",
    "the security of practical qkd systems has previously been discussed in @xcite .",
    "hwang @xcite proposed the decoy state method as an important weapon to combat those sophisticated attack : by preparing and testing the transmission properties of some decoy states , alice and bob are in a much better position to catch an eavesdropper .",
    "hwang specifically proposed to use a decoy state with an average number of photon of order @xmath0 .",
    "hwang s idea was highly innovative .",
    "however , his security analysis was heuristic .    in @xcite , we presented a rigorous security analysis of the decoy state idea .",
    "more specifically , we combined the idea of the entanglement distillation approach in gllp@xcite with the decoy method and achieved a formula for key generation rate @xmath1\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 depends on the implementation ( 1/2 for the bb84 protocol due to the fact that half of the time alice and bob disagree with the bases , and if one uses the efficient bb84 protocol @xcite , @xmath3 ) , the subscript @xmath4 denotes the intensity of signal states , @xmath5 is the gain @xcite of signal states , @xmath6 is the overall quantum bit error rate ( qber ) , @xmath7 is the gain of single photon states , @xmath8 is the error rate of single photon states , @xmath9 is the bi - direction error correction efficiency ( see , for example , @xcite . ) as a function of error rate , normally @xmath10 with shannon limit @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is binary shannon information function , given by , @xmath13    four key variables are needed in eq .",
    "( [ intro : keyrate ] ) . @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be measured directly from the experiment .",
    "therefore , in the paper @xcite , we showed rigorously how one can , using the decoy state idea to estimate @xmath7 and @xmath8 , thus achieving the unconditional security of qkd with the key generation rate given by eq .",
    "( [ intro : keyrate ] ) .",
    "moreover , using the experimental parameters from a particular qkd experiment ( gys ) @xcite , we showed that decoy state qkd can be secure over 140 km of telecom fibers . in summary",
    ", we showed clearly that decoy state can indeed substantially increase both the distance and the key generation rate of qkd .    for practical implementations",
    ", we @xcite also emphasized that only a few decoy states will be sufficient .",
    "this is so because contributions from states with large photon numbers are negligible in comparison with those from small photon numbers . in particular , we proposed a vacuum+weak decoy state protocol . that is to say , there are two decoy states  a vacuum and a weak decoy state .",
    "moreover , the signal state is chosen to be of order @xmath0 photon on average .",
    "the vacuum state is particularly useful for estimating the background detection rate .",
    "intuitively , a weak decoy state allows us to lower bound @xmath7 and upper bound @xmath8 .",
    "subsequently , the security of our vacuum+ weak decoy state protocol has been analyzed by wang @xcite .",
    "let us denote the intensities of the signal state and the non - trivial decoy state by @xmath4 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "wang derived a useful upper bound for @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath15 is the proportion of `` tagged '' states in the sifted key as defined in gllp @xcite . whereas we @xcite considered a strong version of gllp result noted in eq .  ,",
    "wang proposed to use a weak version of gllp result : @xmath17\\}.\\ ] ] such a weak version of gllp result does not require an estimation of @xmath8 .",
    "so , it has the advantage that the estimation process is simple .",
    "however , it leads to lower values of the key generation rates and distances .",
    "the issue of statistical fluctuations in decoy state qkd was also mentioned in @xcite .",
    "our observation @xcite that only a few decoy states are sufficient for practical implementations has been studied further and confirmed in a recent paper @xcite , which is roughly concurrent to the present work .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to analyze the security of a rather general class of two - decoy - state protocols with two weak decoy states and one signal state .",
    "our main contributions are as follows .",
    "first , we derive a general theory for a decoy state protocol with two weak decoy states . whereas wang @xcite considered only our vacuum+weak decoy state protocol@xcite ( i.e. , a protocol with two decoy states  the vacuum and a weak coherent state ) , our analysis here is more general .",
    "our decoy method applies even when both decoy states are non - vacuum .",
    "note that , in practice , it may be difficult to prepare a vacuum decoy state .",
    "for instance , standard voas ( variable optical attenuators ) can not block optical signals completely .",
    "for the special case of the vacuum+weak decoy state protocol , our result generalizes the work of wang @xcite .",
    "second , we perform an optimization of the key generation rate in eq .   as a function of the intensities of the two decoy states and the signal state .",
    "up till now , such an optimization problem has been a key unresolved problem in the subject .",
    "we solve this problem analytically by showing that the key generation rate given by eq .",
    "is optimized when both decoy states are weak .",
    "in fact , in the limit that both decoy states are infinitesimally weak , we match the best lower bound on @xmath18 and upper bound of @xmath8 in the most general decoy state theory where an infinite number of decoy states are used . therefore , asymptotically , there is no obvious advantage in using more than two decoy states .",
    "third , for practical applications , we study the correction terms to the key generation rate when the intensities of the two decoy states are non - zero .",
    "we see that the correction terms ( to the asymptotically zero intensity case ) are reasonably small . for the case where one of the two decoy states is a vacuum (",
    "i.e. , @xmath19 ) , the correction term remains modest even when the intensity of the second decoy state , @xmath20 is as high as @xmath21 of that of the signal state .",
    "fourth , following @xcite , we discuss the issue of statistical fluctuations due to a finite data size in real - life experiments .",
    "we provide a rough estimation on the effects of statistical fluctuations in practical implementations . using a recent experiment @xcite as an example",
    ", we estimate that , our weak decoy state proposal with two decoy states ( a vacuum and a weak decoy state of strength @xmath22 ) can achieve secure qkd over more than 100 km with only a few hours of experiments .",
    "a caveat of our investigation is that we have not considered the fluctuations in the intensities of alice s laser pulses ( i.e. , the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is mainly because of a lack of reliable experimental data . in summary",
    ", our result demonstrates that our two - decoy - state proposal is highly practical .",
    "fifth , we also present a one - decoy - state protocol .",
    "such a protocol has an advantage of being simple to implement , but gives a lower key generation rate .",
    "indeed , we have recently demonstrated experimentally our one - decoy - state protocol over 15 km @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that one - decoy - state is , in fact , sufficient for many practical applications . in summary ,",
    "decoy state qkd is simple and cheap to implement and it is , therefore , ready for immediate commercialization .",
    "we remark on passing that a different approach ( based on strong reference pulse ) to making another protocol ( b92 protocol ) unconditionally secure over a long distance has recently been proposed in a theoretical paper by koashi @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ model ] , we model an optical fiber based qkd set - up . in section [ decoy",
    "] , we first give a general theory for @xmath25 decoy states .",
    "we then propose our practical decoy method with two decoy states .",
    "besides , we optimize our choice of the average photon numbers @xmath4 of the signal state and , @xmath20 and @xmath26 of the decoy states by maximizing the key generation rate with the experimental parameters in a specific qkd experiment ( gys ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also present a simple one - decoy - state protocol . in section",
    "[ stab ] , we discuss the effects of statistical fluctuations in the two - decoy - state method for a finite data size ( i.e. , the number of pulses transmitted by alice ) . finally , in section [ s : conclusion ] , we present some concluding remarks .",
    "in order to describe a real - world qkd system , we need to model the source , channel and detector . here",
    "we consider a widely used fiber based set - up model @xcite .",
    "* source : * the laser source can be modeled as a weak coherent state . assuming that the phase of each pulse is totally randomized , the photon number of each pulse follows a poisson distribution with a parameter @xmath4 as its expected photon number set by alice .",
    "thus , the density matrix of the state emitted by alice is given by @xmath27 is the density matrix of i - photon state for @xmath28 .    *",
    "channel : * for optical fiber based qkd system , the losses in the quantum channel can be derived from the loss coefficient @xmath29 measured in db / km and the length of the fiber @xmath30 in km . the channel transmittance @xmath31 can be expressed as @xmath32    * detector : * let @xmath33 denote for the transmittance in bob s side , including the internal transmittance of optical components @xmath34 and detector efficiency @xmath35 , @xmath36 then the overall transmission and detection efficiency between alice and bob @xmath37 is given by @xmath38    it is common to consider a _ threshold _",
    "detector in bob s side . that is to say , we assume that bob s detector can tell a vacuum from a non - vacuum state .",
    "however , it can not tell the actual photon number in the received signal , if it contains at least one photon .",
    "it is reasonable to assume the independence between the behaviors of the @xmath39 photons in i - photon states",
    ". therefore the transmittance of _ i - photon _ state @xmath40 with respect to a threshold detector is given by @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "* yield : * define @xmath43 to be the yield of an i - photon state , i.e. , the conditional probability of a detection event at bob s side given that alice sends out an i - photon state .",
    "note that @xmath44 is the background rate which includes the detector dark count and other background contributions such as the stray light from timing pulses .",
    "the yield of i - photon states @xmath43 mainly come from two parts , background and true signal .",
    "assuming that the background counts are independent of the signal photon detection , then @xmath43 is given by @xmath45 here we assume @xmath44 ( typically @xmath46 ) and @xmath37 ( typically @xmath47 ) are small .",
    "the _ gain _ of i - photon states @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 the gain @xmath48 is the product of the probability of alice sending out an @xmath39-photon state ( follows poisson distribution ) and the conditional probability of alice s @xmath39-photon state ( and background ) will lead to a detection event in bob .",
    "* quantum bit error rate : * the error rate of i - photon states @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the probability that a photon hit the erroneous detector .",
    "@xmath52 characterizes the alignment and stability of the optical system .",
    "experimentally , even at distances as long as 122 km , @xmath52 is more or less independent of the distance . in",
    "what follows , we will assume that @xmath52 is a constant .",
    "we will assume that the background is random .",
    "thus the error rate of the background is @xmath53 .",
    "note that eqs .",
    ", , and are satisfied for all @xmath42 .",
    "the overall gain is given by @xmath54    the overall qber is given by @xmath55",
    "in this section , we will first discuss the choice of @xmath4 for the signal state to maximize the key generation rate as given by eq .  .",
    "then , we will consider a specific protocol of two weak decoy states and show how they can be used to estimate @xmath18 and @xmath8 rather accurately .",
    "after that , we will show how to choose two decoy states to optimize the key generation rate in eq .  . as a whole",
    ", we have a practical decoy state protocol with two weak decoy states .      here",
    "we will discuss how to choose the expected photon number of signal states @xmath4 to maximize the key generation rate in eq .  .",
    "let us begin with a general discussion .",
    "on one hand , we need to maximize the gain of single photon state @xmath7 , which is the only source for the final secure key . to achieve this , heuristically",
    ", we should maximize the probability of alice sending out single photon signals . with a poisson distribution of the photon number",
    ", the single photon fraction in the signal source reaches its maximum when @xmath56 . on the other hand",
    ", we have to control the gain of multi photon state to ensure the security of the system .",
    "thus , we should keep the fraction @xmath57 high , which requires @xmath4 not to be too large .",
    "therefore , intuitively we have @xmath58.\\ ] ]    as will be noted in the next subsection , alice and bob can estimate @xmath8 and @xmath18 rather accurately in a simple decoy state protocol ( e.g. , one involving only two decoy states ) . therefore , for ease of discussion , we will discuss the case where alice and bob can estimate @xmath8 and @xmath18 perfectly .",
    "minor errors in alice and bob s estimation of @xmath8 and @xmath18 will generally lead to rather modest change to the final key generation rate @xmath59 . according to eqs .   and",
    ", @xmath7 will be maximized when @xmath56 and @xmath8 is independent of @xmath4 , so we can expect that the optimal expected photon number of signal state is @xmath60 .",
    "we consider the case where the background rate is low ( @xmath61 ) and the transmittance is small @xmath62 ( typical values : @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . by substituting eqs .",
    ", , and into eq .",
    ", the key generation rate is given by , @xmath65\\ ] ] this rate is optimized if we choose @xmath66 which fulfills , @xmath67 where @xmath52 is the probability that a photon hits the erroneous detector . then , using the data shown in table [ optmu : tab : data ] extracted from a recent experiment @xcite , we can solve this equation and obtain that , @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "the key generation rate and distance are pretty stable against even a @xmath72 change of @xmath4 .",
    ".key parameters for qkd experiments .",

    "we can see that the optimal @xmath22 is small ( @xmath77 ) through the whole distance .",
    "in fact , it starts at a value @xmath78 at zero distance and increases almost linearly with the distance .",
    "figure  [ stab : fig : rdist ] shows vacuum+weak with statistical fluctuations as compared to the asymptotic case of infinite decoy state and without statistical fluctuations .",
    "we can see that even taking into account the statistical fluctuations , the vacuum+weak protocol is not far from the asymptotic result . in particular , in the short distance region , our two - decoy - state method with statistical fluctuations approaches the performance of the asymptotic limit of infinite decoy states and no statistical fluctuations .",
    "this is so because the channel is not that lossy and statistical fluctuations are easily under control .",
    "this fact highlights the feasibility of our proposal .    wang  @xcite picked the total data size @xmath79 . for long distance qkd ,",

    "in other words , the performance of our two - decoy - state method with statistical fluctuations is still better than the the asymptotic value ( i.e. , without considering statistical fluctuations ) given by wang s method . *",
    "note that gys  @xcite has a very low background rate ( @xmath82 ) and high @xmath52 .",
    "the typical values of these two key parameters are @xmath63 and @xmath83 .",
    "if the background rate is higher and @xmath52 is lower , then our results will have more advantage over wang s .",
    "we illustrate this fact in figure  [ stab : fig : rdistkth ] by using the data from the kth experiment @xcite .",
    "we studied the two - decoy - state protocol where two weak decoy states of intensities @xmath20 and @xmath26 and a signal state with intensity @xmath84 are employed .",
    "we derived a general formula for the key generation rate @xmath59 of the protocol and showed that the asymptotically limiting case where @xmath20 and @xmath26 tend to zero gives an optimal key generation rate which is the same as having infinite number of decoy states .",

    "the memory size requirement is also rather modest ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "a caveat is that we have not considered the fluctuations of the laser intensities of alice , i.e. , the value of @xmath4 , @xmath20 and @xmath26 .",
    "this is because we do not have reliable experimental data to perform such an investigation . for short - distance qkd ,",
    "the effects of statistical fluctuations are suppressed because the transmittance and useful data rate are much higher than long - distance qkd .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> decoy states have recently been proposed as a useful method for substantially improving the performance of quantum key distribution . here , we present a general theory of the decoy state protocol based on only two decoy states and one signal state . we perform optimization on the choice of intensities of the two decoy states and the signal state . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that a decoy state protocol with only two types of decoy states-the vacuum and a weak decoy state  asymptotically approaches the theoretical limit of the most general type of decoy state protocols ( with an infinite number of decoy states ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a one - decoy - state protocol . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we provide estimations on the effects of statistical fluctuations and suggest that , even for long distance ( larger than 100 km ) qkd , our two - decoy - state protocol can be implemented with only a few hours of experimental data . in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> decoy state quantum key distribution is highly practical . </S>"
