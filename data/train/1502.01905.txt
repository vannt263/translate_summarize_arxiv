    "the classical surface theory indicates that for the given metric , the isometric embedding or immersion can be realized if the first fundamental form and the second fundamental form satisfy the gauss - codazzi equations ( cf .",
    "there have been many results for the isometric embedding of surfaces with positive gauss curvature , which can be studied by solving an elliptic problem of the darboux equation or the gauss - codazzi equations ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "when the gauss curvature is negative or changes signs , there are only a few studies in literature .",
    "the case where the gauss curvature is negative can be formulated into a hyperbolic problem of nonlinear partial differential equations , and the case in which the gauss curvature changes signs becomes solving nonlinear partial differential equations of mixed elliptic - hyperbolic type .",
    "han in @xcite obtained local isometric embedding of surfaces with gauss curvature changing sign cleanly .",
    "hong in @xcite proved the isometric immersion in @xmath3 of completely negative curved surfaces with the negative gauss curvature decaying at a certain rate in the time - like direction , and the @xmath5 norm of initial data is small so that he can obtain the smooth solution .",
    "recently , chen - slemrod - wang in @xcite developed a general method , which combines a fluid dynamic formulation of conservation laws for the gauss - codazzi system with a compensated compactness framework , to realize the isometric immersions in @xmath3 with negative gauss curvature .",
    "christoforou in @xcite obtained the small bv solution to the gauss - codazzi system with the same catenoid type metric as in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for other related results on surface embeddings . for the higher dimensional isometric embeddings we refer the readers to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "recall that in chen - slemrod - wang @xcite , the @xmath2 isometric immersion of surfaces was obtained for the catenoid type metric : @xmath6 and negative gauss curvature @xmath7 with index @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the isometric immersion of surfaces with negative gauss curvature and more general metrics . to this end",
    ", we shall apply directly the artificial vanishing viscosity method ( @xcite ) and introduce a transformation of state variables ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the vanishing viscosity limit will be obtained through the compensated compactness method ( @xcite ) .",
    "we shall establish the @xmath0 estimate of the viscous approximate solutions by studying the riemann invariants to find the invariant region ( see e.g @xcite ) in the new state variables .",
    "then we prove the @xmath1 compactness of the viscous approximate solutions , and finally apply the compensated compactness framework in @xcite to obtain the weak solution of the gauss - codazzi equations , and thus realize the isometric immersion of surfaces into @xmath3 . in the new state variables , using the vanishing artificial viscosity method , we are able to obtain the weak solution of the gauss - codazzi system for two classes of metrics , that is , for the catenoid type metric with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and for the helicoid type metric @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath10 .",
    "an important step to achieve this development is to find the invariant regions of the viscous approximate solutions for the wider classes of metrics , for which the introduction of new state variables @xmath16 plays a crucial role .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 solution of the gauss - codazzi equations for the given metric in @xmath2 yields the @xmath2 isometric immersion from the fundamental theorem of surfaces by mardare @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce a new formulation of the gauss - codazzi system and provide the viscous approximate solutions . in section 3 , we establish the @xmath0 estimate for the two types of metrics to get the global existence of the equations with viscous terms . in section 4 , we prove the @xmath17 compactness . in section 5 , combining the above two estimates and the compensated compactness framework we state and prove our theorems on the existence of weak solutions for the surfaces with the catenoid type and helicoid type metrics .",
    "as in @xcite and @xcite , the isometric embedding problem for the two - dimensional riemannian manifolds ( or surfaces ) in @xmath3 can be formulated through the gauss - codazzi system using the fundamental theorem of surface theory ( cf .",
