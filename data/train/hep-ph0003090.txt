    "is the prediction that fundamental physics is not invariant under the operations of parity(p ) , charge(c ) , or their combination , cp .",
    "more precisely , it is the distribution of complex numbers in the sm lagrangian which lead to @xmath0 at an extremely small , @xmath4 , one can form a rephase - invariant measure of @xmath0 equal to @xmath5 where @xmath6 $ ]",
    ". then @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the sm",
    "one finds @xmath9 but observable level @xcite .",
    "currently experiments @xcite are taking data or under construction that will very precisely measure the cabbibo - maskawa - kobayashi ( ckm ) @xcite matrix elements believed responsible for @xmath0 in the sm . any observed discrepancy with the sm prediction indicates that the sm is incomplete in the flavor sector and new physics must appear in the fundamental theory . an excellent candidate for new physics is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "as susy introduces many more potentially large sources of @xmath0 in the mass matrices and various field couplings , its inclusion requires that there be some suitable relationships among the parameters to reproduce the agreement of the existing levels of @xmath0 in @xmath10-decay and electric dipole moment ( edm ) data with the sm predictions @xcite .",
    "the understanding of what @xmath1 parameters are allowed in susy models therefore provides a constraint on such models .",
    "the simplest susy models can not satisfy the experimental edm bounds without either setting all susy @xmath1 phases to zero or raising susy particle masses above @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recent works have noted , however , that the supergravity - broken mssm with @xmath12 phases for the gaugino masses @xmath13 , triscalar coupling @xmath14 , and higgs coupling parameter @xmath2 , and no flavor - mixing beyond the standard ckm matrix can be consistent with existing limits on the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron and neutron @xcite . given this , we may now investigate how the phases in this model will contribute to other @xmath1 observables and how new measurements can constrain the values of these phases .",
    "we choose to investigate several @xmath1 observables of the @xmath3-meson system , as @xmath3-processes occupy both a favorable theoretical and experimental position . on the theoretical side ,",
    "uncertainties from non - perturbative qcd are low due to the large mass of the @xmath15-quark ( @xmath16)@xcite relative to the energy scale @xmath17@xcite characteristic of strong interactions and perturbation theory in @xmath18 is reliable . furthermore , many sm @xmath1 asymmetries in the @xmath3-system are small due to the suppression of ckm matrix elements involving the third generation ; new @xmath1 physics may be easily detectable .",
    "experimentally , many dedicated facilities are already or will soon be generating large amounts of high - precision @xmath3-physics data @xcite . from our analysis",
    "we will see that these experiments will be able to either precisely determine the above set of five phases or reject this particular model of @xmath0 altogether .",
    "we first briefly discuss the features of the mssm in section [ sec : themodel ] and review the edm constraints in section [ sec : edm ] . in section [ sec : bphys ] we begin discussion of how the above phases enter observables in various sectors of @xmath3-meson physics through @xmath0 in pure mixing , mixing and decay , and pure decay effects in the processes @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we collect results and compare with the expected experimental sensitivities in section [ sec : discuss ] . throughout this discussion we reserve most of the more complicated formulae and analyses for the appendix , to which we will refer the reader at the appropriate points .",
    "the setting for our calculations is the mssm superpotential @xmath22 with the chiral matter superfields for quarks and leptons @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and higgs @xmath28 transforming under @xmath29 as : @xmath30    the @xmath31 yukawa matrices @xmath32 couple the three generations of quarks and leptons , and the @xmath2 parameter couples the two higgs . in this discussion",
    "all flavor and gauge indices are implicit .",
    "the superpotential ( [ superpot ] ) and general considerations of gauge invariance give the minimally supersymmetric @xmath29 lagrangian @xmath33 where the kinetic terms have the canonical forms @xmath34 with the indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 running over the scalar fields and gauge group representations , respectively . to this lagrangian",
    "we add a soft supersymmetry - breaking ( @xmath37 ) piece @xmath38 where ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) are the fermionic partners of the gauge bosons of @xmath42 , respectively , and where _ scalar _ implies that only the scalar component of each superfield is used .",
    "susy - breaking of this type is characteristic of supergravity@xcite .",
    "an additional simplification is to take the matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 in ( [ softsusy ] ) along with the yukawa matrices @xmath32 in ( [ superpot ] ) to be simultaneously diagonal in the mass basis after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this implies @xmath45 thus the only mixing between families is the usual ckm matrix since quark and squark mass matrices are diagonalized by the same rotation .",
    "the full lagrangian @xmath46 has six arbitrary phases imbedded in the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath2 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the phase of @xmath15 can immediately be defined to be zero by appropriate field redefinitions of @xmath28 .",
    "a mechanism to set another phase to zero utilizes the @xmath48-symmetry of the lagrangian which is broken by the supersymmetry - breaking terms , in particular the gaugino masses in ( [ softsusy ] ) .",
    "we may perform a @xmath48 rotation on the gaugino fields to remove one of the phases @xmath13 . for consistency with @xcite",
    "we choose @xmath49 real ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "note that this @xmath48 transformation affects neither the phase of @xmath14 , since having the yukawa matrices @xmath51 in ( [ superpot ] ) be real fixes the phases of the same fields that couple to @xmath14 , nor the phase of @xmath2 , as having chosen @xmath52 fixes the phases of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the final set of physical phases we study is @xmath53 .",
    "the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of an elementary fermion , a manifestly @xmath1 quantity , is the coefficient @xmath54 of the effective operator @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the electromagnetic field - strength tensor .",
    "the sm prediction of this coefficient vanishes at one loop ( see figure  [ edmfig]a ) since the ckm phases from the two vertices cancel eachother . for the electron",
    ", @xmath57 even vanishes at two loops and the three - loop prediction is miniscule , of order @xmath58 @xcite . for the neutron edm , gluon interactions can give rise to a two - loop contribution to @xmath59 , but the result is still tiny at @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the above predictions no longer hold if the qcd lagrangian contains the @xmath1 ` @xmath61-term ' @xmath62 , a potentially significant source of @xmath0 , but then the theory is consistent with the edm limits only if @xmath63@xcite ; such a fine - tuning is unnatural and henceforth we assume that @xmath64 .",
    "although the amplitude of a typical supersymmetric contribution to the dipole moment ( see figure  [ edmfig]b ) suffers relative to the sm contribution by a reduction factor of at least @xmath65 from susy particles of mass @xmath66 propagating in the loop , the imaginary piece of the susy amplitude could very well dominate over that from the sm . as previous calculations have shown @xcite , the diagrams in figure  [ edmfig]b lead to edms in violation of the current limits of @xmath67 @xcite and @xmath68 @xcite unless susy particles are heavier than @xmath69 or the @xmath1 phases are less than @xmath70",
    ". however , small phases in fact are not inevitable , for recently it has been pointed out @xcite that a cancellation can occur among the various susy diagrams , allowing @xmath12 @xmath1 phases to be consistent with the current edm experimental limits .",
    "the set of phases @xmath53 enter in any diagram which involves mixing between the following fields :    * charginos ( @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 lies in the matrix @xmath73 which mixes the set @xmath74 * neutralinos ( @xmath75 ) : both @xmath72 and @xmath76 appear in the matrix @xmath77 which mixes + the set @xmath78 * scalars : terms in the lagrangian such as @xmath79 arising from the second term of ( [ susylag ] ) , and @xmath37-terms in ( [ softsusy ] ) introduce @xmath72 and @xmath80 , respectively , into the scalar mass insertions .",
    "the effect is particularly significant in @xmath81-mixing where the yukawa matrices are large .",
    "the susy diagrams which appear in figure  [ edmfig](b ) fall into three classes , shown in figure  [ susyedm ] .",
    "the charged wino - higgsino mixing diagram figure  [ susyedm](a ) provides the dominant contribution to @xmath54 , with the phase of @xmath2 entering the amplitude as expected .",
    "the neutralino - mixing diagram figure  [ susyedm](b ) is numerically smaller than its charged counterpart , but it is of opposite sign and has the same dependence on @xmath72 ; therefore  [ susyedm](a ) and  [ susyedm](b ) partially cancel .",
    "the final type of diagram shown in figure  [ susyedm](c ) has a more complicated phase dependence which , in certain regions of parameter space that are not fined - tuned , leads to a destructive interference with the other two diagrams consistent with current experimental bounds on _ both _ @xmath59 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath12 phases are then permissable , it is important to know whether or not other experimental observables can overconstrain these phases . we next show that the @xmath3 system alone provides enough observables to strongly constrain these phases .",
    "there are many reasons to consider the @xmath3-system in particular for measurements of @xmath0 beyond the sm , a few of which are :    * sm contributions to the relevant observables are down by factors of small ckm matrix elements , so generic non - sm @xmath1 physics should give a very clear signal .",
    "* uncertainties arising from strong interactions are small using heavy quark theory @xcite * large amounts of data will be available in the near future    the @xmath0 in question can arise in any of three ways : through @xmath82 mixing , @xmath3-decay , or through their combination @xcite .      at any given instant of time ,",
    "the propagating meson states are linear combinations @xmath83 which evolve according to the @xmath84 hamiltonian with dispersive and absorptive pieces @xmath85 and @xmath86 , viz @xmath87 if we denote the time evolution of the states as @xmath88 then solving ( [ shrod ] ) it follows@xcite that @xmath89 making use of the fact that @xmath90 which holds for both @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite , we obtain the simplifications @xmath93 the degree of @xmath0 in mixing is contained in the ratio @xmath94 , which from ( [ m12 ] ) is directly proportional to the phase factor in the amplitude of the @xmath95 box diagram ( see figure  [ susybox ] ) .    in the sm , the box graph with internal top quarks in figure  [ susybox](a ) dominates @xmath96 ; correspondingly , the strength of sm @xmath1 mixing is ckm - suppressed by a factor @xmath97 which in the wolfenstein approximation@xcite is @xmath98 . any @xmath95 contribution from new physics",
    "therefore has a generically large effect if it carries any phases with it at all . the leading supersymmetric chargino graph in figure  [ susybox](b )",
    "provides the largest mssm contribution to @xmath96 .",
    "we have computed this box ( see appendix ) and find it to dominate significantly over the sm contribution .",
    "for example , at a typical point in susy parameter space , with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and sparticle masses @xmath101 on the order of @xmath102 , we obtain @xmath103 which is an order of magnitude larger than the sm expectation and is directly sensitive to + @xmath1 susy phases . however , it is difficult to directly measure @xmath104 through mixing effects alone ; both time - dependent and time - integrated mixing effects are usually governed by @xmath105 which is still mostly real and sm - driven .",
    "we must therefore turn to other types of @xmath0 to constrain the mssm phases .      when a particular final state @xmath106 with definite cp quantum numbers is accessible to the decays of a @xmath107 and @xmath108 with amplitudes @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , the asymmetry @xmath111 in the limit of ( [ m12 ] ) becomes @xmath112 where @xmath113 in general contains a dependence on both the weak phases @xmath114 and the strong interaction phases @xmath115 from each diagram contributing an amplitude @xmath116 . in figure  [ psiphi ] , for example , the decay of a @xmath117 to the final states @xmath118 and @xmath119 may either proceed directly ( @xmath120 ) or by oscillating first ( @xmath121 ) .    in the sm the asymmetries in both of these decays are tiny primarily due to the small @xmath122 mixing effects ( see discussion following ( [ m12 ] ) which effectively give the upper bound @xmath123 if susy exists then both of these asymmetries can be an order of magnitude larger as is evident from ( [ q / p ] ) and ( [ asymm ] ) . furthermore , the value of the quantity @xmath124 will differ from its value in the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) by powers of @xmath125 only @xcite , so we set the strong phases at @xmath126 with an uncertainty @xmath127 @xcite . in the case of the decay to @xmath128 figure  [ psiphi](b ) , for example , @xmath129 , whereas for the decay to @xmath118 through the dominant tree - graph figure  [ psiphi](a ) carries no strong - phase dependence at all . from ( [ q / p ] ) and ( [ asymm ] ) it follows as a prediction of our model that @xmath130 we now have two experimental @xmath3-physics signals of new @xmath1 phases which constrain a combination of @xmath131 and @xmath80 independent from those which arise in the edm bounds .",
    "the charged @xmath3-mesons decays can also serve to measure our set of phases .",
    "the asymmetry in the decay to a final state @xmath132 is @xmath133 with @xmath115 and @xmath114 being the strong and weak phases , respectively for the diagram with modulus @xmath116 .",
    "rewritten in the form @xmath134 it is clear that a non - zero asymmetry requires that at least two diagrams contribute with different strong _ and _ weak phases .",
    "one of the interesting features of this mode is that any physical model that introduces new @xmath1 phases can result in an asymmetry far greater than that which the sm predicts ; yet it must not disturb the branching ratio(br ) for @xmath136 which cleo has measured@xcite : @xmath137 in figure  [ bsgfig ] we show the dominant diagrams ; as in the case of the susy contributions to the edms studied above , the most important non - sm diagrams for @xmath138 involve the chargino loop in figure  [ bsgfig](b)@xcite .",
    "since the observed value of the branching ratio ( [ branchbsg ] ) agrees very well with the sm prediction , new decay channels are strongly constrained ; accordingly , we follow the analysis of @xcite in carefully accounting for the higher - order graphs in figure  [ bsgfig](c , d , e ) .",
    "the effective operators involved are @xmath139 we leave the evaluation of these operators and all related calculations for the appendix .    in using these diagrams to compute observables",
    "it is important to take into account that the photon involved in the decay @xmath140 is monochromatic but the photon in the observable @xmath141 has a variable energy .",
    "in addition to depending on the final state @xmath142 , the photon energy is also a function of how the b - quark is bound inside the @xmath3-meson ; if the recoil energy of the b - quark is small , non - perturbative effects arise for which no reliable models currently exist .",
    "these considerations lead us to perform all calculations using a variable outgoing photon energy , @xmath143 , which is bounded from below : @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is between 0 and 1 and @xmath146 is a model - dependent quantity .",
    "the actual dependence on @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the computed asymmetry @xmath147 turns out to be negligable , as we demonstrate in the appendix .",
    "here we present the result @xmath148 where as in the case @xmath149 the strong phase dependence is included in the coefficient and imparts a @xmath150 uncertainty to this prediction .",
    "the magnitude of the asymmetry is admitedly not very large , however it is at least twice the sm prediction @xcite .",
    "one particularly striking signature of the presence of the susy phases is in the decay @xmath151 . here",
    "the flavor structure @xmath152 forbids a sm tree graph , so the leading sm graph is a penguin ( defined ` p ' ) , as shown in figure  [ bkphi](a ) .    the leading susy contribution in figure  [ bkphi](b )",
    "is also a type of penguin ( hereafter designated a superpenguin , ` sp ' ) , suppressed however by a factor @xmath153 relative to the sm due to a squark propagating in the loop instead of a @xmath154-boson .",
    "so far the situation parallels the decay @xmath155 above , but the major difference is that here the @xmath0 is necessarily _",
    "direct_. referring back to ( [ bsg ] ) , with @xmath156 running over @xmath157 , we see that the asymmetry receives contributions from 36 interference terms .",
    "however the imaginary parts of sp - sp interference terms are zero since the squarks in the loops of sp graphs are heavier than the @xmath15-quark and do not give rise to absorptive phases in the amplitude(_i.e . _ the @xmath158 s are zero in ( [ bsg ] ) ) .",
    "this leaves sp - p and p - p terms .",
    "the latter , being purely sm terms , must always involve at least one @xmath159-quark to get a nonzero weak phase ( @xmath160 is real ) , whereas the former need not involve @xmath159-quarks since the weak phase difference necessary for a non - zero asymmetry can come from a susy coupling in @xmath161 or @xmath81 graphs .",
    "therefore the dominant sp - p terms will ( in the notation of [ bsg ] ) have @xmath162 and @xmath163 , leading over the p - p terms by a factor @xmath164",
    ". therefore the p - p terms are negligable and the asymmetry is fundamentally due to the susy - sm interference . assuming as before that the lightest @xmath81 dominates the sp , the numerator of ( [ bsg ] ) only contains the term due to @xmath81-@xmath165 interference : @xmath166 we now employ the one - loop perturbative calculation of the strong phase @xmath167 from the @xmath165-quark loop @xcite , and since @xmath168 is negligable and @xmath169 is essentially the same phase we calculated for @xmath19-quark and outgoing @xmath170-quark is l - r for @xmath19 , the l - l and r - r helicity structures of @xmath171 give negligable contributions to the _ phase _ of the diagram ] we obtain @xmath172 here we see that the absence of neutral flavor changing currents , the hierarchy of the ckm matrix , and the pattern of cp quantum numbers all conspire in this case to give an asymmetry which is essentially zero in the sm yet for susy with typical sparticle masses can be as large as 30% !",
    "we have seen that the @xmath3-system observables above provide many constraints on the phases @xmath173 in the model .",
    "we may classify the experiments by the size of the event samples they are expected to provide :    high luminosity(h@xmath174 ) : : :    for example experiments at the lhc p - p collider , producing a sample of    order @xmath175 @xmath82 pairs per    year @xcite low luminosity(l@xmath174 ) : : :    experiments run at @xmath176 machines such as cesr(cleo    iii ) , +    kekb(belle ) , and pep - ii(babar ) as well as at hadronic machines such as    fermilab(cdf , d ) and desy(hera - b : actually @xmath177 )    produce similar samples of @xmath82 pairs , +    of order @xmath178 per year ( * ? ? ?",
