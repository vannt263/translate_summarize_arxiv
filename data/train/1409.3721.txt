    "the star p cygni was discovered on august 18 , 1600 ad when it brightened to about the third magnitude .",
    "it is a `` prototypical '' galactic luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star and its basic properties are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several attempts to get informations on size , chemical composition and density distribution of the material around the star have been already done ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite got [ nii ] @xmath46584 narrow band images showing unresolved clumps of emission distributed within a nearly circular nebula with angular diameter of about 22@xmath1 and hint at the presence of nebular rings with radii of 6@xmath1 and 11@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite found clumps , typically 2@xmath13@xmath1 in diameter , not symmetrically distributed around the star ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite observations are consistent with a homogeneous , spherically symmetric , constant velocity , isothermal flow .",
    "an outer shell with a radius of @xmath61.6 is also present indicating mass ejection before 1600ad ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )    near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy of p cygni ( @xcite and @xcite ) revealed bright emission in the [ feii ] line at @xmath4=1.6435@xmath0 m . @xcite",
    "derived from the analysis of high  resolution spectra the following geometric parameters of pcygni inner  shell : a mean expansion velocity of 136kms@xmath7 , a shell radius of about 10@xmath8 cm , a dynamic age of about 530yr , and a geometric filling factor in [ feii ] roughly equal to 0.2 .",
    "they concluded that the [ feii ] emitting shell at about 10@xmath1 from p cygni is the product of the 1600ad outburst . in their results",
    "the cause of greater uncertainty was the uncertainty in the adopted pcygni distance ( 1.7@xmath90.1kpc ) and the need of assuming a filling factor .",
    "in fact , the choice of the latter was somehow arbitrary since they had no nir images and only relatively low spatial resolutions orthogonally and along their long slit spectra , i.e. @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .    a significant step forward in the knowledge of pcygni nebula in particular and of lbv stars in general would require high resolution 3d information on the nebular structure which , in our opinion , has become possible with the availability , nowadays , of large ground  based telescopes , technologically advanced instruments , and adaptive optics ( ao ) systems . in this paper",
    "we present a collage of 72 near - infrared camera pisces @xcite images obtained by the large binocular telescope ( lbt , @xcite ) ao system in a narrow band filter centered on the 1.6435@xmath0 m nir forbidden line of feii .",
    "the final image covers a field of view of about 20@xmath1 around pcygni and provides high resolution 2d information on pcygni nebula which will be complemented with future radial velocity observations in order to derive the nebular distribution along the line of sight . in section [ obs ]",
    "we present the main characteristics of the instrumental setup and of the acquired ao images ; in section [ reduction ] we describe the image processing which lead to a composite image of the nebular emission around pcygni from the set of 72 individual images ; in section  [ result ] the 2d spatial distribution of pcygni nebula is presented and our results are compared with those already available in the literature .",
    "both telescopes of the lbt are equipped with a high order adaptive optics system called first light adaptive optics , flao @xcite .",
    "the flao senses the atmospheric turbulence by means of a pyramid based wavefront sensor @xcite which samples the pupil on a grid of @xmath12 sub - apertures .",
    "a corrected wavefront is obtained through an adaptive secondary mirror ( asm ) ( @xcite and @xcite ) controlled by 672 actuators at a frequency of 1khz .",
    "the spatial and temporal configurations of the flao match the performance of the asm . on typical seeing values of 0.8",
    "the flao provides in the h band high order corrected images with strehl ratios of about 80% on bright reference sources .",
    "pcygni is a bright reference for the flao system , whose r band magnitude operative range is between 3.5 and the 17mag .",
    "actually , the flao system , whose filter of the wavefront sensor is centered at 0.7@xmath0 m , detected this star as a 5.5mag object .      in order to provide early science with the lbt adaptive optics system before the arrival at the telescope of the diffraction limited camera , we have the opportunity to utilize the pisces infrared camera provided by the university of arizona .",
    "pisces provides diffraction limited images in the 12.5@xmath0 m range with a pixelscale of 0.019arcsec / px . further details on pisces camera can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observations of pcygni were obtained on june 22@xmath13 2012 in the [ feii ] emission line filter centered on the emission line at 1.6435@xmath0 m . in order to avoid saturation and to cover a field of about 46 in diameter centered on pcygni , we intentionally moved the star out of the field of view .",
    "we used 12 different observational sets : the first four were obtained by putting pcygni about 0.5 north , south , east , or west out of the field of view ; the other eight set were obtained from the first four after applying a 30 or 60 degrees rotation of the lbt gregorian rotator .",
    "we took six 20s images in each observational set leading to a total of 72 images . during the observations the differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) on board the lbt measured a variable seeing between 0.9 to 1.5 ( v band ) .",
    "the telescope elevation was ranging from 70 to 84 degrees and the dimm was pointing as close as possible to the target .",
    "we follow a standard data reduction method for near infrared data . electronic cross  talk between the quadrants in the pisces detector was corrected using `` corquad '' , an iraf procedure developed by roelof de jong .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a few stars present in each reduced frame is about 0.07 -.10 , slightly variable along the field of view because of the anisoplanatism effect .",
    "the average fwhm and strehl ratio ( sr ) are 0.08 and 12% , respectively .    [",
    "cols=\"^,>,>,^,<,<,^ \" , ]     very likely a background sources      to improve the transformation from image coordinates in pixel to astronomical ra and dec we searched for astrometrically calibrated images in the available databases and we found several wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images taken with f658n filter .",
    "then , we identified on the image built by co - adding the retrieved images several faint stars surrounding pcygni .",
    "the same stars were searched on our images and their positions were used in _",
    "ccmap _ and in _ ccsetwcs _ iraf tasks to add a world coordinate system ( wcs ) to each of our individual frames .",
    "eventually , the 72 frames were combined with the _ imcombine _ iraf task to create a merged / collaged _ comb _ image and a @xmath14image covering about an almost circular field of view of about 23 in radius with a central vignetting of about 1 .",
    "both images have astrometric accuracy on the order of @xmath15 as derived by the residuals of the position fit in _",
    "ccmap_. the _ comb _ image is shown , in arbitrary intensity scale , in fig.[comb_im ] with superimposed circles marking the positions of the comparison stars derived from the wfpc2 image .",
    "it is clearly evident that the scatter light of the pcygni point spread function ( psf ) dominates and must be removed before investigating the nebular emission .",
    "as far as the angular resolution of the _ comb _ image is concerned the analysis of the comparison stars indicate an average fwhm of about 0@xmath1.08 confirming that the lbt ao system was able to achieve diffraction limit quality in the [ feii ] @xmath4=1.6435@xmath0 m filter .    assuming a circular symmetric psf , we computed radial profiles of pcygni scatter light distribution at different azimuth angles @xmath16 .",
    "the hypothesis of circular symmetry was then checked by over - plotting pairs of radial profiles at @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( see some examples in fig.[prof ] ) .",
    "finally , the distributions of intensity of the radial profiles at different distances , @xmath5 , from the nominal position of pcygni were built and analyzed leading to , for each @xmath5 , at the determination of the intensity of the mean angular radial profile of the scattered light .",
    "to do this , we assumed that the minimum ( after removing a few clear outliers ) of the distribution of intensity at each radial distance is not affected by a significant nebular emission .",
    "we were able to derive a reliable radial profile only in an annulus around pcygni position characterized by an inner and an outer radius of @xmath183@xmath1 and @xmath1819@xmath1 respectively .",
    "in fact , at @xmath193@xmath1 there is practically no pair ( @xmath16 , @xmath5 ) where a contribution of nebular emission can be excluded _ a priori _ , while at @xmath2019@xmath1 the radial profiles are very noisy due to the reduced number of overlapping individual frames used to obtain the _ comb _ image at these distances from p cygni and to the intrinsic low signal in each individual frame .",
    "the image of the nebular emission , _ neb _ , was eventually obtained by subtracting the above  described scattered light model from the _ comb _ image and it is shown in fig.[neb_im ] .",
    "by comparing the intensity levels of the _ neb _ image with those of the @xmath14image , we were able to identify in the former several nebular emission regions in the [ feii ] line at @xmath4=1.6435@xmath0 m ( labeled in fig.[neb_reg ] ) which can be defined as those close regions characterized by an signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) greater than 3 . in table[tab1",
    "] we report , for each region , its size and total intensity within its boundary defined by the s / n=3 threshold , and the positions and the intensity of its emission maxima ( knots ) . as can be seen in fig.[neb_reg ]",
    "most of the emission regions are consistent with the finding by @xcite which stated , on the bases of radial velocity measurements , that inner ",
    "shell of the pcygni nebula can be approximated with a spherical shell characterized by an inner an outer radius at a distance of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "our results are also in relatively good agreement with the image in [ nii ] @xmath46584 of the inner  shell found by @xcite even if we do not find a larger diameter in the north  south direction than in the east  west direction . on the other hand ,",
    "our results show clearly the presence of extended emission also inside @xmath21 and outside @xmath22 with some asymmetry due to stronger emission at north ",
    "northwest than at south  east of pcygni .",
    "there are also hints of emission regions at larger radial distances , i.e. @xmath23 and of some possible connection with the internal regions in the north  west ( see region r in fig.[neb_reg ] ) .",
    "while we are very confident on the results we obtained for @xmath24 we must point out that for larger @xmath5 we have the co  addition of only few individual frames and larger uncertainties on the subtracted average radial profile of pcygni scattered light . thus , the presence of a second region of nebular emission at the border of our field of view would require more dedicated observations to be soundly confirmed .",
    "a direct comparison of our results with those already reported in the literature can be done by superimposing over the _ neb _ image the _ spex _ ( red box in fig.[slits ] ) and the three _ cshell _ long slits ( blue , green , and magenta boxes in fig.[slits ] ) used in the paper by @xcite .    by integrating in ra",
    "the _ neb _ image counts contained in the _ spex _ slit region we obtained fig.[spex ] which can be compared with top panel of fig.4 by @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , there is a general agreement between our results and those previously reported by @xcite .",
    "it is also very clear , by comparing the upper and the lower panel , the gain in spatial resolution we achieved by taking advantage of the lbt ao system .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that our integrated counts contains not only the nebular emission at the [ feii ] line at @xmath4=1.6435@xmath0 m but , actually , the whole nebular emission in the filter wavelength band , thus including also some contribution from the weak nebular continuum .",
    "this continuous emission , which can be seen in third panel of fig.3 by @xcite , can explain why our integrated counts in the lower panel of fig.[spex ] do not go to zero at a distance of about 15@xmath1 east or west from pcygni ra as in fig.4 by @xcite .",
    "as far as the _ cshell _ slits are concerned , the integration in dec of the _ neb _ image counts should be compared with fig.5 by @xcite taking into account that we do not have radial velocity information . in any case , there is a qualitative agreement since the maxima in the right panels of fig.[cshell ] fall at the same dec of the knots in fig.5 by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the intensity of the different maxima in fig.[cshell ] are the results of co  adding the emission of nebular regions along the line of sight characterized by different radial velocities .",
    "the same effect is obviously present in fig.s[neb_im][spex ] showing that to derive the actual 3d mapping of the inner  shell of pcygni nebula we have to wait until complete coverage in both imaging and radial velocity will be available .",
    "with the aim of deriving a full 3d picture of the inner  shell of pcygni nebula , we aim to obtain nir spectra in the wavelength region of the strongest [ feii ] nebular lines to discriminate in our image the approaching and the receding parts of the ejecta by measuring their radial velocities .",
    "these spectroscopic measurements , together with our 2d image , will allow us to use a more detailed geometry and a more constrained filling factor value than those used by @xcite , to derive more reliable and accurate estimate of the ejecta mass .",
    "furthermore , the radial velocity measurements in the regions at radial distances larger than 10@xmath1 might allow us to get hints on the dates of ejection episode(s ) that occurred before the 1600 ad outburst .",
    "in such a way we could estimate the typical time period between such eruptions which is needed in order to understand how much of the mass loss , which causes a massive stars to become a wolf ",
    "rayet star , occurs in giant brief eruptions .    in conclusion , it is also worthwhile noticing that it could be feasible to measure the expansion proper motions of the inner  shell of pcygni nebula starting from the high spatial resolution ( 0@xmath1.08 ) image presented in this paper by obtaining , in the near future , new nir ao images .",
    "in fact , assuming a constant expansion velocity of @xmath6140km / s and a distance of 1.7kpc , it would be possible to resolve the apparent motion of the brightest emission knots after an elapsing time of less than 10 years .",
    "we acknowledge the support from the lbt - italian coordination facility for the execution of observations , data distribution and reduction .",
