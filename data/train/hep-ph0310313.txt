    "the discovery of cp violation in 1964 through the observation of @xmath2 decays came as a big surprise @xcite . as is well known , this particular manifestation of cp violation , which is described by the famous parameter @xmath3 , originates from the fact that the mass eigenstate @xmath4 is not a pure cp eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath5 , but one that receives also a tiny admixture of the cp - even eigenstate .",
    "after tremendous efforts , also `` direct '' cp violation , i.e.  cp - violating effects arising directly at the decay - amplitude level , could be established by the na48 ( cern ) and ktev ( fnal ) collaborations in 1999 , through a measurement of a non - vanishing value of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this observable does not allow a stringent test of the standard - model description of cp violation , unless significant theoretical progress concerning the relevant hadronic matrix elements can be made ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .    in this decade",
    ", the exploration of cp violation is governed by @xmath0 mesons , which provide various tests of the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa mechanism @xcite , allowing us to accommodate this phenomenon in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "moreover , these studies offer also interesting insights into hadron dynamics .",
    "we will hence focus on the @xmath0-meson system in the following discussion ; a considerably more detailed review can be found in @xcite . at the moment",
    ", the experimental stage is governed by the asymmetric @xmath7 @xmath0 factories operating at the @xmath8 resonance , with their detectors babar ( slac ) and belle ( kek ) .",
    "these experiments have already established cp violation in @xmath9 decays in 2001 , which represents the beginning of a new era in the exploration of cp violation , and many interesting strategies can now be confronted with the data @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "we expect also interesting @xmath0-physics results from run ii of the tevatron , which will provide  among other things  first access to decays of @xmath1 mesons @xcite . in the era of the lhc , these modes",
    "can then be fully exploited @xcite , in particular at lhcb ( cern ) and btev ( fnal ) .",
    "= 5.3truecm        in order to tackle this challenging problem , we may follow three main avenues .",
    "first , we may try to calculate the hadronic matrix elements entering ( [ ampl - struct ] ) , which is a very challenging issue . nevertheless , as was discussed at this workshop by c.t .",
    "sachrajda and z. wei , interesting progress could recently be made in this direction through the development of the qcd factorization and perturbative hard - scattering formalisms , as well as soft collinear effective theory ( for a comprehensive review , see @xcite ) .    in order to convert measurements of cp asymmetries of the kind specified in ( [ cp - intro ] ) into solid information on the angles of the ut , it is desirable to reduce as much as possible the theoretical input on hadronic matrix elements .",
    "such strategies , allowing in particular the determination of @xmath21 , are provided by fortunate cases , where we may eliminate the hadronic matrix elements through relations between different decay amplitudes : we distinguish between exact relations , involving pure tree - diagram - like decays of the kind @xmath28 or @xmath29 , and relations , which follow from the flavour symmetries of strong interactions , involving @xmath30 decays ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the third avenue we may follow is to employ decays of neutral @xmath31 mesons ( @xmath17 ) , where we may obtain interference effects between @xmath15@xmath16 mixing and decay processes , leading to another type of cp violation , `` mixing - induced '' cp violation , which allows us to play many games . if such a transition is dominated by a single weak amplitude , i.e.  the sums in ( [ ampl - intro ] ) and ( [ ampl - intro - cp ] ) run only over a single term , the corresponding `` unknown '' hadronic matrix element cancels in the mixing - induced cp asymmetry ; the most important example in this context is the `` golden '' mode @xmath9 .",
    "it is also very interesting and useful to complement relations between different decay processes with such cp - violating observables .",
    "these modes originate from @xmath33 quark - level processes , and may receive contributions both from penguin and from tree topologies , where the latter involve the ut angle @xmath21 . since the ratio of tree to penguin contributions is governed by the tiny ckm factor @xmath34 , @xmath32 decays are dominated by qcd penguins , despite their loop suppression .",
    "as far as electroweak ( ew ) penguins are concerned , their effects are expected to be negligible in the case of the @xmath35 , @xmath36 system , as they contribute here only in colour - suppressed form . on the other hand",
    ", ew penguins may also contribute in colour - allowed form to @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and are hence expected to be sizeable in these modes , i.e.  of the same order of magnitude as the tree topologies .",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40    thanks to interference effects between tree and penguin amplitudes , we obtain a sensitivity on @xmath21 . in order to determine this angle , we may use an isospin relation as a starting point , suggesting the following combinations : the `` mixed '' @xmath41 , @xmath42 system @xcite@xcite , the `` charged '' @xmath41 , @xmath43 system @xcite@xcite , and the `` neutral '' @xmath44 , @xmath42 system @xcite . as noted in @xcite , all three @xmath32 systems can be described by the same set of formulae , just making straightforward replacements of variables .",
    "let us first focus on the charged and neutral @xmath32 systems . in order to determine @xmath21 and the corresponding strong phases",
    ", we have to introduce appropriate cp - conserving and cp - violating observables : @xmath45\\ ] ] @xmath46,\\ ] ] where the @xmath47 and @xmath48 refer to the plus and minus signs , respectively . for the parametrization of these observables",
    ", we employ the isospin relation mentioned above , and assume that certain rescattering effects are small , which is in accordance with the qcd factorization picture @xcite ; large rescattering processes would be indicated by @xmath49 modes , which are already strongly constrained by the @xmath0 factories , and could be included through more elaborate strategies @xcite .",
    "following these lines , we may write @xmath50 where the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 have the following meaning : @xmath51 describes the ratio of ew penguin to tree contributions , and can be determined with the help of @xmath54 flavour - symmetry arguments , yielding @xmath55 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath52 measures the ratio of tree to qcd penguin topologies , and can be fixed through @xmath54 arguments and data on @xmath56 modes @xcite , which give @xmath57 . finally , @xmath53 is the cp - conserving strong phase between the tree and qcd penguin amplitudes . since we may fix @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the observables @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "actually depend only on the two `` unknown '' parameters @xmath53 and @xmath21 .",
    "if we vary them within their allowed ranges , i.e.   @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we obtain an allowed region in the @xmath47@xmath48 plane @xcite",
    ". should the measured values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 fall outside this region , we would have an immediate signal for new physics ( np ) . on the other hand , should the measurements lie inside the allowed range , @xmath21 and @xmath53 could be extracted .",
    "the value of @xmath21 thus obtained could then be compared with the results of other strategies , whereas the strong phase @xmath53 would offer interesting insights into hadron dynamics .",
    "this exercise can be performed separately for the charged and neutral @xmath32 systems .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpik - os ] , we show the allowed regions in the @xmath47@xmath48 planes @xcite , where the crosses represent the averages of the current @xmath0-factory data . as can be read off from the contours in these figures , both the charged and the neutral @xmath60 data favour @xmath61 , which would be in conflict with the @xmath21 range in ( [ ut - fit - ranges ] ) following from the `` standard analysis '' of the ut .",
    "interestingly , the charged modes point towards @xmath62 ( factorization predicts @xmath63 to be close to @xmath64 @xcite ) , whereas the neutral decays seem to prefer @xmath65 .",
    "since we do not expect @xmath63 to differ significantly from @xmath66 , we arrive at a `` puzzling '' picture of the kind that was already considered a couple of years ago in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the data for the mixed @xmath32 system fall well into the sm region in observable space and do not indicate any `` anomalous '' behaviour .",
    "a detailed discussion of this `` @xmath32 puzzle '' , which may be a manifestation of new physics in the ew penguin sector , and its relation to rare @xmath0 and @xmath67 decays , was recently given in @xcite .",
    "it will be very exciting to follow the evolution of the data .",
    "a particularly simple but very important special case arises for neutral @xmath31-meson decays ( @xmath17 ) into final cp eigenstates @xmath68 , which satisfy @xmath69 . here we obtain the following expression @xcite : @xmath70,\\label{fleischer - cp - asym}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 with @xmath72,\\ ] ] describe the `` direct '' and `` mixing - induced '' cp - violating observables , respectively . in the sm , the cp - violating weak @xmath15@xmath16 mixing phase @xmath73 is associated with the well - known box diagrams , and is given by @xmath74 where @xmath20 is the usual angle of the ut .",
    "looking at ( [ fleischer - cp - asym ] ) , we observe that @xmath75 provides another observable @xmath76 , which is , however , not independent from those in ( [ fleischer - obs ] ) .",
    "one of the most famous @xmath0-meson decays , the `` golden '' mode @xmath77 to extract @xmath78 @xcite , originates from @xmath79 quark - level processes . within the sm",
    ", it receives contributions both from tree and from penguin topologies , so that we may write the decay amplitude as follows : @xmath80,\\ ] ] where the hadronic parameter @xmath81 is a measure of the ratio of the penguin to tree contributions @xcite .",
    "since this quantity enters in a doubly cabibbo - suppressed way , and is navely expected to be of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a `` generic '' expansion parameter @xcite , we arrive at @xmath84 @xmath85 the decay @xmath77 and similar channels led to the observation of cp violation in the @xmath0 system in 2001 @xcite ; the current status of @xmath86 is given as follows : @xmath87 yielding the world average @xmath88 which agrees well with the results of the `` ckm fits '' of the ut summarized in ( [ ut - fit - ranges ] ) , implying @xmath89 .    in the lhc era",
    "@xcite , the experimental accuracy of @xmath78 may reach a level requiring deeper insights into the corrections affecting ( [ bpsik - cp - mix ] ) .",
    "a possibility to control them is provided by the @xmath90 channel @xcite .",
    "moreover , also direct cp violation in @xmath9 allows us to probe these effects .",
    "so far , there are no experimental indications for a non - vanishing value of @xmath91 .    the agreement between ( [ s2b - average ] ) and the `` ckm fits '' is striking .",
    "however , it should not be forgotten that np may nevertheless hide in @xmath92 .",
    "the point is that the key quantity is actually @xmath93 itself , which is given by @xmath94 here the former value agrees perfectly with @xmath95 , which is implied by the `` ckm fits '' , whereas the latter would correspond to np .",
    "the two solutions can obviously be distinguished through a measurement of the sign of @xmath96 . to accomplish this important task ,",
    "several strategies were proposed @xcite , but their practical implementations are unfortunately rather challenging .",
    "one of the most accessible approaches employs the time - dependent angular distribution of the @xmath97 k^\\ast[\\to\\pi^0k_{\\rm s}]$ ] decay products , allowing us to extract @xmath98 if we fix the sign of a hadronic parameter @xmath99 , which involves a strong phase @xmath100 , through factorization @xcite .",
    "another important testing ground for the sm description of cp violation is provided by the decay @xmath101 , which originates from @xmath102 quark - level processes . in analogy to its charged counterpart @xmath103 , this mode is governed by qcd penguins @xcite , but also ew penguin contributions are sizeable @xcite . since such penguin topologies are absent at the tree level in the sm , @xmath104 decays represent a sensitive probe for np effects . within the sm , we obtain the following relations @xcite@xcite : @xmath105 @xmath106    the current experimental status of the cp - violating @xmath101 observables is given as follows @xcite :",
    "@xmath107 @xmath108 since we have , on the other hand , @xmath109 , we arrive at a puzzling situation , which has already stimulated many speculations about np effects in @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "however , because of the large experimental uncertainties and the unsatisfactory current situation , it seems too early to get too excited by the possibility of having large np contributions to the @xmath101 decay amplitude .",
    "it will be very interesting to observe how the @xmath0-factory data will evolve , and to keep an eye on @xmath110 and other related modes .",
    "the @xmath112 channel is another prominent @xmath0-meson transition , originating from @xmath113 quark - level processes . in the sm , we may write @xmath114,\\ ] ] where the cp - conserving strong parameter @xmath115 measures the ratio of the penguin to tree contributions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath77 amplitude ( [ bdpsik - ampl2 ] ) , this parameter does _ not _ enter ( [ bpipi - ampl ] ) in a doubly cabibbo - suppressed way , thereby leading to the well - known `` penguin problem '' in @xmath111 . if we had negligible penguin contributions , i.e.   @xmath116 , things would simplify as follows : @xmath117 where we have used @xmath118 and the unitarity relation @xmath119 in the last identity .",
    "we observe that actually @xmath93 and @xmath21 enter directly @xmath120 , and not @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , since @xmath93 can straightforwardly be fixed through @xmath9 , we may use @xmath111 to probe @xmath21 .",
    "the current status of the cp - violating @xmath111 observables is given as follows : @xmath121 @xmath122 the babar and belle results are not fully consistent with each other . if we calculate , nevertheless , the weighted averages of ( [ adir - exp ] ) and ( [ amix - exp ] ) , we obtain @xmath123 where the errors in brackets are those increased by the pdg scaling - factor procedure @xcite . should large direct cp violation in @xmath111 , as suggested by ( [ bpipi - cp - averages ] ) , be confirmed by future data , we would require large penguin contributions with large cp - conserving strong phases .",
    "a significant impact of penguins on @xmath111 is also indicated by the data on the @xmath124 branching ratios @xcite , as well as by theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is already evident that we _ must _ take the penguin contributions to @xmath111 into account .",
    "@xmath125 @xmath126    a possibility to deal with this problem is provided by the strategies proposed in @xcite , employing @xmath42 ( for alternative approaches , see @xcite ) .",

    "taking into account the @xmath0-factory result @xmath131 , the cp asymmetries in ( [ bpipi - cp - averages ] ) and ( [ bpipi - cp - averages2 ] ) point towards the following picture : for @xmath132 , we obtain @xmath133 , in full accordance with the sm . on the other hand , the unconventional @xmath134 solution , which would require cp - violating np contributions to @xmath135@xmath136 mixing , favours @xmath137 .",

    "the results of this exercise are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho - eta - bpipi ] , following @xcite , where also ranges for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given and a detailed discussion of the theoretical uncertainties can be found .",

    "at the @xmath7 @xmath0 factories operating at @xmath8 , @xmath1 mesons are not accessible . on the other hand , plenty of @xmath1 mesons will be produced at hadron colliders .",
    "consequently , these particles are the `` el dorado '' for @xmath0-decay studies at run ii of the tevatron @xcite , and later on at the lhc @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of @xmath1 physics is the mass difference @xmath146 of the @xmath1 mass eigenstates , which can be complemented with @xmath147 to determine the side @xmath148 of the ut . to this end",

    "their angular distribution exhibits tiny direct cp violation , whereas mixing - induced cp - violating effects allow the extraction of @xmath160 since we have @xmath161 in the sm , the determination of this phase from ( [ sinphis ] ) is affected by generic hadronic uncertainties of @xmath155 , which may become an important issue for the lhc era .",

    "another important aspect of the exploration of cp violation is the @xmath1-meson system , which will be accessible at run ii of the tevatron and can be fully exploited in the era of the lhc .",
    "certainly a promising future of cp violation and quark - flavour physics is ahead of us !",
    "i would like to thank the organizers , in particular giuseppe nardulli and pietro colangelo , for inviting me to this very interesting and extremely pleasant workshop .",
