    "<S> the alkaline earth binary oxides adopt a simple rocksalt structure and form an important family of compounds because of their large presence in the earth s mantle  @xcite and their potential use in microelectronic devices  @xcite . in comparison to the class of multifunctional ferroelectric perovskite oxides @xcite , however , their practical applications remain limited and the emergence of ferroelectricity and related functional properties in simple binary oxides seems so unlikely that it was never previously considered . here , we show using first - principles density functional calculations that ferroelectricity can be easily induced in simple alkaline earth binary oxides such as barium oxide ( bao ) using appropriate epitaxial strains . going beyond the fundamental discovery , we show that the functional properties ( polarization , dielectric constant and piezoelectric response ) of such strained binary oxides are comparable in magnitude to those of typical ferroelectric perovskite oxides , so making them of direct interest for applications . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that magnetic binary oxides such as euo , with the same rocksalt structure , behave similarly to the alkaline earth oxides , suggesting a route to new multiferroics combining ferroelectric and magnetic properties .    the alkaline earth oxides  </S>",
    "<S> mgo , cao , sro and bao  have been intensively studied  @xcite and their electronic structures , elasticities , thermal properties and equations of state are well established @xcite . in view of their relatively wide band gaps and their compatibility with silicon </S>",
    "<S> , they recently aroused some interest as possible gate dielectrics to replace sio@xmath0 in mosfet devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , they have been shown to play a key role as a buffer layer in the epitaxial growth of multifunctional perovskite oxides directly on silicon  @xcite . as a result , many recent works have been devoted to the study of ao oxide thin films on silicon substrates , with a special emphasis on their lattice mismatch , coherence and band offsets with si  @xcite . surprisingly , although many studies of the phase diagrams at high pressure have been performed @xcite , the phase diagrams of alkaline earth oxides under epitaxial strain have not been previously reported .    </S>",
    "<S> ferroelectricity in oxides is usually associated with the family of abo@xmath1 perovskites @xcite . the ferroelectric phase transition in this class of materials </S>",
    "<S> is described in terms of a displacive transition from a high - symmetry paraelectric phase by condensation of a polar transverse - optical ( to ) soft phonon mode below the critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , this is characterized by a decrease in frequency of the to mode as the ferroelectric transition temperature is approached from above ; computationally , the frequency of the to mode is found to be imaginary in the paraelectric phase , consistent with the absence of a restoring force for ionic displacements @xcite . as first proposed by cochran @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric instability can be explained from the compensation of short - range forces favoring the undistorted paraelectric structure by long - range coulomb interactions favoring the ferroelectric phase . </S>",
    "<S> this was confirmed at the first - principles level @xcite , pointing out that the unusually large destabilizing coulomb interaction yielding the instability in this class of compounds is linked to giant anomalous born effective charges , @xmath2 ( 2.77 e , 7.25 e and -5.71 e for ba , ti and o in batio@xmath1 instead of nominal charges of 2.0 e , 4.0 e and -2.0 e ) , themselves produced by the strong sensitivity of o 2p  metal d hybridizations to atomic displacements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tendency of materials to ferroelectric instability was also recently reformulated in the framework of vibronic coupling theory @xcite . there again , the rearrangement of electrons through covalent bond formation when atoms are displaced , typically resulting in anomalous @xmath2 , appears as an important feature to yield ferroelectricity .    </S>",
    "<S> alkaline earth oxides exhibit anomalous @xmath2 , related to o 2p  metal d hybridizations through a mechanism similar to abo@xmath1 compounds @xcite : we obtain values of 2.81 e , 2.49 e and 2.39 e respectively for bao , sro and cao ( the nominal charge is 2.0 e in all cases ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , tendency to ferroelectricty has never been reported or studied in alkaline earth oxides . </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric instablity is known to be strongly sensitive to strain and , recently , it was shown that strain engineering can be used to induce ferroelectricity in otherwise non - ferroelectric abo@xmath1 compounds @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore whether the same strategy can be applied to ao compounds , by studying the properties of different binary oxides under epitaxial strain using density functional theory calculations ( see methods section ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by calculating the to phonon frequencies of the alkaline earth oxides as a function of epitaxial strain to search for the onset of a softening or instability . in their non - distorded cubic rocksalt structure , </S>",
    "<S> these oxides have a three - fold degenerate to mode at the @xmath3 point . under biaxial epitaxial strain , </S>",
    "<S> as can be practically achieved in thin films on a substrate , the symmetry is reduced to tetragonal ( space group _ i4/mmm _ , no . </S>",
    "<S> 139 ) , inducing a splitting of the cubic to mode into a single a@xmath4 mode polarized along the [ 001 ] tetragonal axis , and a two - fold degenerate e@xmath5 mode polarized either along the [ 100 ] or [ 010 ] axis .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the case of bao . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_combo].a shows the evolution of the a@xmath4 and e@xmath5 frequencies with respect to a wide range of epitaxial strain , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the relaxed lattice constant of bao and @xmath8 is the lattice constant of the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see that the to mode frequencies are strongly strain - dependent . for compressive epitaxial strains ( @xmath9 ) , the e@xmath5 frequency increases smoothly whereas the a@xmath4 frequency decreases strongly until it becomes imaginary at a critical epitaxial strain @xmath10 - 1.3% ( left vertical line of figure  [ fig_combo].a ) . a similar behavior is observed for tensile epitaxial strains ( @xmath11 ) , </S>",
    "<S> but here it is the e@xmath5 frequency that becomes imaginary at @xmath121.8% ( right vertical line of figure  [ fig_combo].a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a polar to mode with an imaginary frequency is the fingerprint of ferroelectricity : the condensation of either the a@xmath4 or e@xmath5 unstable mode in bao will induce a spontaneous polarization and yield a ferroelectric ground - state .     </S>",
    "<S> ( red circles ) and e@xmath5 ( blue squares ) modes of bao with respect to the epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> negative numbers correspond to imaginary frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) energy as a function of polarization for epitaxial bao . </S>",
    "<S> green crosses , blue squares and red circles correspond to an epitaxial strain of respectively -0.6% , -1.63% and -2.67% . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) bao static dielectric constant @xmath13 versus the epitaxial strain ( @xmath14 red squares , @xmath15 green crosses , @xmath16 blue circles ) and ( d ) 1/@xmath13 versus the epitaxial strain ( 1/@xmath14 red squares , 1/@xmath16 blue circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) frequencies of the a@xmath4 ( red circles ) and e@xmath5 ( blue squares ) modes of bao / sro superlattice with respect to the epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> negative numbers correspond to imaginary frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> ( f ) amplitude of the spontaneous polarization of euo with respect to the epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> red circles and blue squares are respectively for out - of - plane and in - plane orientation of the polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical lines of graphs a , c , d , e and f give the position of the critical strains @xmath17 and @xmath18.,width=604,height=281 ]    to determine the ground - state under high epitaxial strains , we next performed full atomic relaxations , intialized by condensing the unstable polar modes , for each mistfit strain exceeding the critical value . for compressive epitaxial strain , the strongest instability corresponds to polar distortions along the [ 001 ] direction ( a@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the condensation of this instability brings the system to a new ground - state , hereafter called the c - phase , with a non - zero polarization along the [ 001 ] direction ( p@xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gain of energy with respect to the paraelectric reference ( @xmath20e ) , the polarization ( p ) and the tetragonality @xmath21 are reported in table  [ dataepitax ] . at an epitaxial strain of -2.66% , </S>",
    "<S> these numbers are huge for an otherwise classical dielectric compound and comparable in amplitude to a typical ferroelectric such as batio@xmath1 ( p@xmath2234 @xmath23c.@xmath24 , @xmath20e@xmath223.8 mev / atom ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_combo].b shows the evolution of the energy with the polarization resulting from the atomic relaxation at an epitaxial strain of -2.63% ( red circles curve ) . as imposed by symmetry , the variation of energy is the same when the polarization is oriented up or down , so that the energy displays the double - well shape characteristic of a ferroelectric compound . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> an analogous plot is shown at an epitaxial strain of -0.6% ( green crosses in figure  [ fig_combo].b ) where no polar instability is present . here a single - well shape is obtained , indicating that there is no energy gain when the compound is polarized .    </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any other phonon instability in the polar phase , as explicitly checked from the computation of the full phonon dispersion curves , confirms that the ground - state indeed corresponds to the ferroelectric c - phase when @xmath25 . as in the case of the ferroelectric perovskites , </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonality is strongly modified by the polarization ; we find that the polarization increases the tetragonality ( @xmath21=@xmath26+@xmath27 ) of the structure with respect to the paraelectric reference and the change of @xmath21 is continuous at @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> .amplitude of the spontaneous polarization @xmath28p@xmath28 , gain of energy @xmath20e with respect to the paraelectric reference , ratio between the out - of - plane and the in - plane cell parameter ( ba - o distances ) of the paraelectric reference @xmath26 and of the ground - state @xmath21 for five epitaxial strains where the c - phase or the aa - phase are stable . [ cols=\">,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     now that we have demonstrated the possibility of inducing ferroelectricity in bao thin films under epitaxial strain , we investigate if the phenomenon is specific to bao or a more general feature shared with other alkaline earth compounds . looking at cao and sro , we find a very similar behavior . </S>",
    "<S> compressive ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> tensile ) epitaxial strain makes the a@xmath4 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> e@xmath5 ) mode softer . </S>",
    "<S> however , since at the bulk level , the cubic to frequencies of sro and cao are higher than in bao , the calculated critical epitaxial strains are also larger : @xmath10 - 5.1% ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> -6.7% ) and @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> 6.1% ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> 7.7% ) in sro ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> cao ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the larger critical strains make cao and sro less attractive for applications than bao , the natural tendency to ferroelectricity of the class of alkaline earth compounds suggests tuning of the ferroelectric properties in superlattices made of the repetition of different oxide layers ; such behavior was realized recently in abo@xmath1 compounds  @xcite . as a prototypical example </S>",
    "<S> , we consider here a bao / sro superlattice built by alternating one layer of bao and one layer of sro along the [ 001 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice mismatch between bao and sro is relatively large ( @xmath307.7% ) and will prevent the growth of large period superlattices but should not be problematic in ultra - short period systems . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the relaxed in - plane cell parameter of the bao / sro superlattice in its paraelectric phase is close to the average of the bao and sro cell parameters ( see supplementary information ) . at this relaxed cell parameter </S>",
    "<S> , bao will be under compressive strain and sro under tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> since such epitaxial strains will favor the c - phase in bao and the a - phase in sro , we can expect a competition between the two orientations of the polarization in the superlattice . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> all the epitaxial strains reported are calculated with respect to the relaxed in - plane cell parameter of the superlattice in its paraelectric phase .    in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_combo].e we show the evolution of the a@xmath4 and e@xmath5 modes with respect to epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> we find that _ both _ of them are unstable for a range of epitaxial strains from -0.24% to 1.58% ; outside this range _ either _ a@xmath4 or e@xmath5 is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly contrasts with the case of individual ao compounds , where the a@xmath4 and e@xmath5 modes are never unstable together , and the regions in which they are respectively unstable are separated by a range of epitaxial strain without any instability . </S>",
    "<S> this feature makes the superlattice even more interesting : whatever the epitaxial strain , we expect the ground - state to be ferroelectric .    </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by the structural relaxation which produces the following sequence of ferroelectric ground - state for the bao / sro superlattice : ( _ i _ ) for @xmath310.07% , the ground - state is ferroelectric with polarization along the out - of - plane direction ( c - phase ) ; ( _ ii _ ) for 0.07%@xmath321.15% , the ground - state corresponds to a monoclinic phase where the polarization has a component in the in - plane direction and one in the out - of - plane direction giving rise to a small relaxation of the angle between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 axis ( ac - phase ) ; ( _ iii _ ) for @xmath351.15% , the ground - state is ferroelectric with polarization along the in - plane direction ( a - phase ) .    </S>",
    "<S> having demonstrated that ferroelectricity can be strain engineered in different alkaline - earth oxides , we now investigate the possibility of inducing ferroelectricity in the ferromagnetic binary oxide euo which crystallizes in the same rocksalt structure , as a novel route to multiferroism . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as for the non - magnetic oxides , we find that euo becomes ferroelectric under epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , its magnetic state remains ferromagnetic through the ferroelectric region . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated critical epitaxial strains for euo are @xmath10 - 3.3% and @xmath29 4.2% . </S>",
    "<S> these critical strains are larger than those of bao but remain experimentally achievable . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_combo].f we show the calculated evolution of the spontaneous polarization with respect to the epitaxial strain . here , again , the amplitude of the polarization can reach sizable values ( 60 @xmath23c.@xmath36 at -5.5% ) with out - of - plane or in - plane orientation for respectively compressive and tensile epitaxial strain .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope that our theoretical findings will motivate experimentalists to confirm our prediction that ferroelectricity and related dielectric functionalities can be induced in ao compounds of rocksalt structure using epitaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it should be possible to tune or modify the properties in thin films and superlattices by appropriate choice of substrate lattice constant . if the epitaxial strain is bigger than the critical value @xmath37 , a ferroelectric ground - state with non - zero polarization and piezoelectric response should be observed . </S>",
    "<S> if the experimental strain is substantial , but smaller than the critical value , the material will be paraelectric , but its to mode frequency and dielectric constant should be strongly strain - dependent as reported in figure  [ fig_combo].d .    </S>",
    "<S> strain - induced ferroelectricity in simple rocksalt ao oxides comparable to that in abo@xmath1 oxides is not only an astonishing fundamental finding but also of direct interest for practical applications . </S>",
    "<S> although ferroelectric perovskites are considered as potentially interesting high - k gate dielectrics for mosfet transistors , a significant drawback is their small bandgap which results in unsuitable band offsets with si . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is directly overcome with strained ao compounds . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we predict that bao films epitaxially grown on si ( @xmath38=-2.0% ) should exhibit a ferroelectric ground - state under appropriate electrical boundary conditions  @xcite . in the context of multiferroism , </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to induce ferroelectricity in simple magnetic oxides is particularly attractive ; previous searches have focussed on more complex compounds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the case of euo is particularly interesting since together with inducing ferroelectricity , the epitaxial strain is expected to increase the ferromagnetic curie temperature  @xcite , providing a route to higher temperature multiferroics . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to further tune the properties in superlattices combining different ao compounds offers tremendously promising and still unexplored possibilities . </S>"
