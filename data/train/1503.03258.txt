    "the current mapping of neural connectivity patterns relies on advanced neuro - imaging techniques , which have recently allowed for the reconstruction of structural human brain networks , establishing at an individual - based level which brain regions are mutually connected , as well as the strength of pairwise connections . the resulting `` human connectome network '' @xcite has been found to be structured in moduli or compartments characterized by a much larger intra than inter connectivity organized in a hierarchical fractal - like fashion across diverse scales @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "the relation between structural and functional networks is a current challenge in modern neuroscience . in this context",
    ", a few pioneering works found that the hierarchical - modular organization of structural brain networks has remarkable implications for neural dynamics @xcite .",
    "as opposed to the case of simpler network structures , neural activity propagates in hierarchical networks in a peculiar way .",
    "for example , models of neural activity propagation usually exhibit two familiar phases percolating and non - percolating , respectively but it has been recently found @xcite that when such models operate on top of the `` human connectome '' structural network a novel intermediate regime , named a `` griffiths phase '' @xcite emerges .",
    "this novel phase originates from the highly - diverse and relatively isolated structural moduli where dynamical activity may remain mostly localized for long time periods @xcite .",
    "given that the correct brain functioning requires coherent neural activity at a wide range of scales @xcite , the study of synchronization among neural populations is one of the central ideas in computational neuroscience @xcite .    in a recent work @xcite , some of us scrutinized the special features of synchronization dynamics @xcite using the canonical kuramoto model for phase synchronization @xcite , in the actual human connectome ( hc ) network @xcite . in analogy to what described above for activity propagation , we uncovered the existence of a novel intermediate phase for synchronization dynamics , stemming from the hierarchical modular organization of the hc .",
    "furthermore , we found that the dynamics in such a region presented a plethora of complex and interesting dynamical features @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to describe in more detail the complex behavior within such an intermediate regime , both in individual moduli and at a global brain level .",
    "we measure the fluctuations of the global order parameter as a function of the overall coupling strength , and we show that there is a broad region ( rather than a unique `` critical '' point ) with huge variability and response .",
    "finally , we assess the role of noise and perturbations in the robustness of the metastable stated arising in the intermediate regime , and we show that adding intrinsic fluctuations to the picture of synchronization dynamics in hierarchical modular networks accounts for the ability of the brain to explore different attractors , giving access to the varied functional configurations recorded in experiments @xcite .",
    "the hc network we employ consists of a set of @xmath0 nodes , each of them representing a population of neurons producing self - sustained oscillations @xcite , connected pairwise through a precise pattern of symmetric weighted edges , altogether determining a connectivity matrix @xmath1 @xcite .    on top of such a hc network",

    "the kuramoto complex order parameter is defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 gauges the overall coherence and @xmath15 is the average phase .",
    "it is common wisdom that for an ( infinitely ) large population of oscillators interacting in a fully connected network , the model exhibits a phase transition at some value of @xmath10 , separating a coherent steady state ( @xmath16 ) from an incoherent one ( @xmath17 , plus @xmath18 finite - size corrections ) @xcite . on the other hand , in the absence of frequency heterogeneity",
    "the system always reaches a coherent state .",
    "thus , frequency heterogeneity is responsible for frustrating synchronization if the coupling strength is weak .",
    "similarly , in our recent work @xcite we argued that the combined effect of frequency heterogeneity _ and _ network heterogeneity ( in particular , a hierarchical modular structure ) can lead to much richer and interesting ways of ordering frustration . here",

    "the observed variability in the central region means either that ( i ) larger time windows would be required for the system to self - average or ( ii ) that ergodicity is broken and for each parameter value the realization ends up in a different type of ( stable or metastable ) steady state , depending on the initial condition .",
    "this last possibility implies that the system may remain trapped in some sort of metastable states , from which it can escape away only after very rare and large fluctuations .",
    "these observations are robust against changes in the frequency distribution , connectivity matrix normalization , and other details , whereas the location and width of the intermediate phase are not universal .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "2 has been obtained for a gaussian frequency distribution but similar curves are obtained for , usually employed , lorentzian or uniform distributions .    as this robust intermediate regime is reminiscent of griffiths phases in networks posed in between order and disorder and emerging from rare - region effects",
    "@xcite it is natural to wonder how the structural network modularity affects synchronization dynamics in general . as a matter of fact , it is straightforward to convince oneself that any network consisting of perfectly isolated moduli , each of them synchronized at different intrinsic frequencies and phases , should exhibit oscillations of the collective order parameter , @xmath33 , and these oscillations are preserved when the moduli are weakly interconnected @xcite .",

    "( b ) in the early region of the intermediate phase , a few moduli are coherent ( as the one in orange ) but most of them remain unsynchronized ( violet ) , and the system does not present coherence for upper scales in the hierarchy .",
    "( c ) increasing @xmath10 , more heterogeneity of synchronization among moduli is found , and the system exhibits complex trajectories for the intermediate ( hemispheres ) and global scale .",
    "( d ) in the coherent phase , all moduli are synchronized , and trajectories are concentric circles.,width=377 ]    we are interested in quantifying the observed variability of @xmath33 in the intermediate phase . to this end , we take a particular realization of frequencies ( extracted from a gaussian @xmath7 ) and , starting from an initial uniformly distributed random configuration of individual phases , @xmath38 , we measure the temporal standard deviation of the global coherence parameter @xmath33 ( after the transient ) up to a maximum time @xmath39 , @xmath40 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath10 . , that we call , `` _ _ time variability _ _ '' is closely related to the chimera index introduced by shanahan @xcite .",
    "while chimera indices are averaged between individual network moduli and measure the onset of local coherence , @xmath41 is defined at the global level and records fluctuations of the global order parameter . ]    as ergodicity may be broken , different initial conditions may lead to different attractors of the dynamics , therefore we also average @xmath41 over @xmath42 different independent realizations of the dynamical process .",
    "results are illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , in which we also have plotted the diagram of the order parameter obtained for this particular realization of @xmath43 averaged over the @xmath42 realizations . let us stress the following salient aspects : _",
    "i ) _ averaged time variabilities are small in the non - coherent ( @xmath44 ) as well as in the coherent ( @xmath45 ) phases , whereas much larger variabilities are found in the intermediate region ( @xmath46 ) ; _ ii ) _ the curve of time variabilities presents several peaks for the intermediate region , lying in the vicinity of values of the control parameter at which the system experiences a change in its level of coherence ( see the corresponding jumps in the derivative of the order parameter ) ; and finally , _",
    "iii ) _ error bars are also larger in the intermediate phase ; this variability of time variabilities means that different initial conditions can lead to different types of time - series , suggesting a large degree of metastability in the intermediate regime .     and standard deviation of time - series , averaged over realizations with different uniformly distributed initial conditions .",
    "maximal variability is found in the intermediate phase , where the system is neither too unsynchronized nor too coherent .",
    "several peaks in the variability can be distinguished ( dashed lines ) , which appear at values of the control parameter @xmath10 for which the system experiments a fast increase in global synchronization . statistical sampling of different realizations",
    "indicate that errorbars are larger in the intermediate region , suggesting the existence of several attractors depending on the initial conditions .",
    "we have averaged @xmath42 different realizations , each one integrated for @xmath47 time steps . ,",
    "width=340 ]      our previous results vividly illustrate the existence of an intermediate region in which the hc exhibits maximal dynamical variability at the global scale , suggesting metastable behavior . in order to explore more directly whether metastable states exist",
    ", we now assess if the dynamics may present different attractors and , for some values of the control parameter @xmath10 and noise amplitudes , if the system may switch between different global attractors with different levels of coherence .",
    "5 ( a ) shows a time series of the global parameter , for a fixed realization of internal frequencies and initial phases .",
    "it clearly illustrates how the hc spontaneously switches between two different attractors .",
    "these type of events , however , are not easy to observe in the hc network . due to the coarse - grained nature of the hc mapping , different attractors may actually have comparable average values of the coherence @xmath33 , which makes their discrimination especially difficult at the global scale .    instead",
    ", such events are easier to spot in synthetic hierarchical modular networks ( hmn ) , such as proposed to model brain networks in an efficient way ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in such hierarchical networks ,",
    "the effects of modularity and hierarchy are much enhanced , as they develop across a larger number of hierarchical levels than the one allowed by current imaging techniques for empirically obtained connectomes .",
    "all the previously reported phenomenology is still present in such hmns ( see @xcite ) ; in particular , the phase diagram of the synchronization order parameter exhibits a phase transition with an intermediate region , where variability is much enhanced @xcite .",
    "5 ( b ) illustrates the bi - stable nature of the global parameter in the intermediate phase for a hmn , in which metastability can be very well appreciated .",
    "this switching behavior closely resembles `` up and down '' states , which are well known to appear in certain phases of sleep or under anaesthesia ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .     in the intermediate region : for low noise amplitudes ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , the system stays stable in the same attractor .",
    "but , for sufficiently large values , such as @xmath50 , the system is able to `` jump '' to another more coherent attractor , where it settles .",
    "( b ) in hmns ( size @xmath51 , @xmath52 hierarchical levels ) , we observe the same phenomenology , but much enhanced : when noise is very low ( @xmath53 ) , the system tends to remain stable in a certain attractor ( with a few exceptions after very large waiting times ) . choosing a higher @xmath12 ( @xmath54 ) , the system exhibits bi - stable behavior , switching intermittently between two different attractors . for large enough @xmath12 ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the dynamics becomes too erratic to appreciate metastability . here",
    ", frequencies were extracted from a lorentz distribution .",
    ", width=491 ]    we hypothesize that hierarchical modular networks in general ( and the hc in particular ) enable the possibility of a large repertoire of attractors , with different degrees of coherence and stability .",
    "such metastability can be made evident and quantified by performing the following type of numerical test .",
    "starting from a fixed random initial condition and considering a vanishing noise amplitude ( i.e. @xmath48 ) , the system might deterministically fall into a number of different attractors , each of them with an associated value of the global coherence depending on the initial conditions , the network structure , and the choice of natural frequencies .",
    "once this attractor a is reached , the system is perturbed by switching on a non - vanishing noise amplitude ( @xmath56 ) during a finite time window .",
    "the system may remain stable in the same attractor a if the noise is weak enough ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "however , if larger values of the noise amplitude are chosen , the system may jump into another close , more stable , attractor .",
    "if the noise amplitude is very large ( @xmath58 ) , the system can in principle jump to any attractor , but , very likely , will also escape from it , wandering around a large fraction of the configuration space .",
    "after the perturbation time - window is over , we let the system relax once again , and check if the new resulting steady steady state b has changed with respect to a. in that case , we can conclude that the systems was in a metastable state a before the perturbation , and has reached another state b after it  potentially a metastable state itself .",
    "we have carried out this type of test using an artificial hmn ( see fig .",
    "6 ) for a specific value of the control parameter , @xmath10 , belonging in the intermediate region .",
    "natural frequencies are sampled from the a lorentzian distribution @xmath43 ( as above , our main results are not sensible to this choice ) .",
    "starting from a random initial configuration of phases , we integrate eq .",
    "[ eq : kuramoto ] up to time @xmath59 with @xmath48 . after this",
    ", we introduce the external perturbation by switching the noise coefficient @xmath12 to a certain non - zero value during a time window of duration @xmath42 .",
    "finally we revert to @xmath48 and continue the integration up to time @xmath60 . the last steady state value is averaged over @xmath61 realizations of initial conditions , networks , and intrinsic frequencies .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , for low as well as for high values of the noise amplitude , the system has the same average order parameter close to @xmath62 , as could have been anticipated .",
    "however , a resonant peak emerges for intermediate values of the noise , where the system switches to states with different levels of coherence .",
    "this plot explicitly illustrates the existence of metastability and noise - induced jumps between attractors .",
    "as noise is enhanced , progressively more stable states are found , but above some noise threshold , the system does not remain trapped in a single attractor but jumps among many , resulting in a progressive decrease of the overall coherence .",
    "averaged in time over @xmath61 realizations .",

    "simulations are run on hmn networks of size @xmath51 , with @xmath52 hierarchical levels.,width=340 ]",
    "it is well established that in the absence of frequency dispersion , the kuramoto dynamics leads to a perfectly coherent state , which is progressively achieved in time by following a bottom - up ordering dynamics in which increasingly larger communities become synchronized @xcite .    if a hierarchical modular networks is loosely connected , this type of `` matryovska - doll '' synchronization process is constrained at all levels by structural bottlenecks , bringing about anomalously - slow synchronization dynamics as recently reported @xcite .    in the presence of intrinsic frequency dispersion the above slow ordering process",
    "is further frustrated @xcite . for small values of @xmath10",
    "the system may remain trapped into metastable states in which the loose connectivity between some moduli does not allow them to overcome intrinsic - frequency differences and achieve coherence . while persistence in metastable states may extend indefinitely , experimental evidence suggests that the brain is able to switch between a rich repertoire of attractors @xcite .",
