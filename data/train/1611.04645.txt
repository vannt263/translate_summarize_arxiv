    "wireless systems require fundamental and crisp understanding of design principles and control mechanisms to efficiently manage network resources .",
    "resource allocation policies lie at the heart of wireless communication networks , since they aim at guaranteeing the required quality of service ( qos ) at the user level , while ensuring efficient and optimized operation at the network level to maximize operators revenue .",
    "resource allocation management in wireless communications may include a wide spectrum of network functionalities , such as scheduling , transmission rate control , power control , bandwidth reservation , call admission control , transmitter assignment , and handover @xcite . in this survey ,",
    "a resource allocation policy is defined by the following components : _ i _ ) a multiple access technique and a scheduling component that distributes resources among users subject to individual qos requirements ; _ ii _ ) a signaling strategy that allows simultaneous transmission of independent data streams to the scheduled users ; and _ iii _ ) rate allocation and power control that guarantee qos and harness potential interference .",
    "[ fig : mu - mimo - layered - tasks ] illustrates these components and the interconnection between them .",
    "the figure highlights the fact that each function of the resource allocation strategy can be performed in either optimal or suboptimal way , which is elaborated upon below .",
    "the multiple access schemes can be classified as orthogonal or non - orthogonal .",
    "the former is a conventional scheme that assigns radio resources , e.g. , code , sub - carrier , or time slot , to one user per transmission interval .",
    "the main characteristic of orthogonal multiple access schemes is their reliability , since there is no need to deal with co - resource interference",
    ". the resource allocation policy can optimize with reasonable complexity several performance metrics , such as throughput , fairness , and qos @xcite .",
    "the multiplexing gain , i.e. , the number of scheduled users , is limited by the number of available radio resources in the system . in non - orthogonal multiple access ,",
    "a set of users concurrently superimpose their transmissions over the same radio resource , and potentially interfere with each other . in this scheme",
    "the co - resource interference can be mitigated by signal processing and transmission techniques implemented at the transmitter and/or receiver sides .",
    "such techniques exploit different resource domains , e.g. , power , code , or spatial domain , and a combination of them are envisaged to cope with the high data rate demands and system efficiency expected in the next generation of wireless networks @xcite .",
    "hereinafter , we focus on multiple access schemes based on multi - antenna transceivers operating at the spatial domain , i.e. , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) .",
    "mimo communication , where a multi - antenna base station ( bs ) or access point ( ap ) transmits one or many data streams to one or multiple user equipments simultaneously , is a key technology to provide high throughput in broadband wireless communication systems .",
    "mimo systems have evolved from a fundamental research concept to real - world deployment , and they have been integrated in state - of - the - art wireless network standards @xcite , e.g. , ieee 802.11n , 802.11ac wlan , 802.16e ( mobile wimax ) , 802.16 m ( wimax ) , 802.20 ( mbwa ) , 802.22 ( wran ) , 3gpp long - term evolution ( lte ) and lte - advanced ( e - utra ) .",
    "resource allocation is particularly challenging in wireless communication systems mainly due to the wireless medium variability and channel randomness , which renders the overall performance location - dependent and time - varying @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , high spectral efficiency and multiplexing gains can be attained in mimo systems since multiple data streams can be conveyed to independent users . by exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom ( dof ) offered by multiple antennas we can avoid system resource wastage @xcite .",
    "multiuser ( mu ) mimo systems have been extensively investigated over the last years from both theoretical and practical perspective . in a recent evolution of mu - mimo technology , known as massive mimo or large - scale mimo @xcite ,",
    "few hundreds of antennas are employed at the bs to send simultaneously different data streams to tens of users .",
    "massive mimo has been identified as one of the promising air interface technologies to address the massive capacity requirement required demanded by 5 g networks @xcite .",
    "+    the downlink transmission is particularly challenging in mu - mimo scenarios because the geographic location of the receivers is random and joint detection can not be performed .",
    "the main goal is to convey independent data streams to a set of properly selected users , attaining spatial multiplexing gain offered by mu - mimo .",
    "however , determining such a users set is a very challenging task , which depends on all elements of the resource allocation strategy , e.g. , individual qos requirements , signaling schemes , rate allocation and power control strategies implemented at the transmitter .",
    "mimo systems allow for a plethora of mighty signal processing techniques that enhance the system performance by exploiting a multi - dimensional pool of resources .",
    "this pool is composed of resources with different nature , e.g. , signal spaces , transmission powers , time slots , sub - carriers , codes , and users .",
    "efficient allocation designs over such a large set of resources implies that a tradeoff between optimality and feasibility . on the one hand",
    ", optimality can be reached by solving optimization problems over a set of integer and continuous variables , which may be a thoroughly complex task .",
    "feasibility , on the other hand , implies that suboptimal resource allocation takes place by relaxing and reformulating optimization problems whose solutions can be found by practical and reliable algorithms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : preliminaries ]",
    "we present the basic ideas behind mimo wireless communications , introduce mu - mimo systems , and discuss the main challenges . in section",
    "[ section : system - set - ups ] we introduce the most commonly studied mu - mimo channel and system models , their characteristics and conventional assumptions .",
    "section  [ section : precoding ] is devoted to signal design and precoding schemes under different conditions of channel information . in section  [ section : metrics - spatial - compatibility ] we introduce the most common metrics of spatial compatibility , which are used to categorize users and reduce the scheduling complexity .",
    "section  [ section : performance - uf ] presents a classification of optimization criteria and describes the usual constraints considered in mu - mimo systems . in section  [ section : algorithms ]",
    "we propose a classification of the several techniques to address the user scheduling problem .",
    "the specific characteristics , limitations and use cases for each technique are discussed .",
    "section  [ section : algorithms : selection - partial - csit ] is focused on scheduling algorithms with partial channel information at the transmitter .",
    "we categorize the existing approaches and present guidelines to minimize complexity and improve efficiency . in section  [ section : power - allocation ]",
    "we present the most common power allocation schemes and discuss their role in mu - mimo systems .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ section : remarks ] . the reader can find a list of technical terms and abbreviations summarized in table  [ table : abbreviations ] .",
    "we adopt the following notation : matrices and vectors are set in upper and lower boldface , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 denote the transpose , the hermitian transpose , the absolute value , and the @xmath4-norm , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 denote the rank and null space of matrix @xmath7 . @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the subspace and orthogonal subspace spanned by the columns of matrix @xmath7 .",
    "calligraphic letters , e.g. @xmath10 , denote sets , and @xmath11 denotes cardinality .",
    "@xmath12 is the set of nonnegative real numbers and @xmath13 is the space of @xmath14 matrices .",
    "@xmath15 is the complex gaussian distribution with mean @xmath16 and covariance matrix @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath17 $ ] denotes expectation .",
    "a mimo system employs multiple antennas at the transmitter ( @xmath18 ) and receiver ( @xmath19 ) sides to improve communication performance .",
    "the seminal works @xcite provide a mathematical motivation behind multiple antenna processing and communications .",
    "theoretical analysis has shown that the spectral efficiency , i.e. , the amount of error - free bits per second per hertz ( bps / hz ) , follows the scaling low @xmath20 , without increasing the power or bandwidth requirements .",
    "the signal processing techniques in multi - antenna systems can be classified as _ spatial diversity techniques _ and _ spatial multiplexing techniques _",
    "@xcite .    spatial diversity techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) , provide transmission reliability and minimize error rates .",
    "this is attained by transforming a fading wireless channel into an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn)-like channel , i.e. , one can mitigate signal degradation due to fading @xcite .",
    "the probability that multiple statistically independent channels experience simultaneously deep fading gets very low as the number of independent paths increases .",
    "the spatial diversity techniques can be applied at both transmission and reception sides of the link .",
    "transmit diversity schemes include space diversity , polarization diversity , time diversity , frequency diversity , and angle diversity .",
    "examples of receive diversity schemes are selection combining , maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) , and equal gain combining @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on spatial multiplexing techniques , which exploit the dof provided by mimo .",
    "spatial multiplexing is tightly related to multiuser communications and smart antennas processing @xcite . in multiuser systems ,",
    "spatial multiplexing gains can be attained by steering signals toward specific receivers , such that the power to intended users is boosted .",
    "simultaneously , co - channel interference to unintended users can be partially or completely suppressed .    in mu - mimo systems , the available resources ( power ,",
    "bandwidth , antennas , codes , or time slots ) must be assigned among @xmath21 active users .",
    "there are two kinds of multiuser channels : the downlink channel , also known as _ broadcast channel _ ( bc ) , where a single transmitter sends different messages to many receivers ; and the uplink channel , also called _ multiple access channel _ ( mac ) , where many transmitters communicate with a single receiver .",
    "there are several _ explicit _ differences between bc and mac . in the former ,",
    "the transmitted signal is a combination of the signals intended for all co - scheduled users , subject to total transmit power , @xmath22 , constraints .",
    "in contrast , in the mac channel , the signal from the @xmath23-th user is affected by other co - scheduled users , subject to individual power constraints , i.e. @xmath24 , @xcite .",
    "there exists an _",
    "implicit _ connection between bc and mac , known as _ duality _ , which establishes the relationship between the capacity regions of both access channels @xcite .",
    "the bc - mac duality has been fundamental to define optimal policies for power allocation , signaling , and qos guaranteeing in mu - mimo systems , see @xcite .",
    "the capacity regions include operative point where transmission to multiple users do not interfere with each other . every transmission is performed over orthogonal signaling dimensions , which is a signal separation called duplexing @xcite .",
    "this operation is performed by allocating communications across different time slots , known as time - division - duplex ( tdd ) , or across separated frequency bands , known as frequency - division - duplex ( fdd ) .    in the literature of mu - mimo",
    ", two types of diversity are studied : _ spatial multiplexing diversity _ and _ multiuser diversity _ ( mudiv ) .",
    "the former is a consequence of the independent fading across mimo links of different users .",
    "this means that independent data streams can be transmitted over parallel spatial channels , increasing the system capacity @xcite .",
    "the latter arises when users that are geographically far apart have channels that fade independently at any point in time .",
    "such independent fading processes can be exploited so that users with specific channel conditions are simultaneously scheduled @xcite .",
    "there are two modes of transmission in mimo systems , see fig .",
    "[ fig : su - mu - mimo ] : single user ( su ) and multiuser ( mu ) mode .",
    "the su - mimo mode improves the performance of a single user , allocating one or many data streams in the same radio resource . in the mu - mimo mode",
    ", different data streams are sent to different users such that a performance metric is optimized , e.g. , the average sum rate .     +    selecting between su- or mu - mimo transmission modes",
    "depends on the accuracy of the channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) , the amount of allowed interference , the target rate per user , the number of user , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime , and the achievable capacity in each mode @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , by assuming sufficient csit knowledge , mu - mimo processing techniques provide several performance gains @xcite : multiple antennas attain diversity gain , which improves bit error rates ( ber ) ; directivity gains realized by mudiv , since the spatial signatures of the users are uncorrelated , which mitigates inter - user interference ( iui ) ; immunity to propagation limitations in su - mimo , such as rank loss or antenna correlation ; and multiplexing gains that scale , at most , with the minimum number of deployed antennas .",
    "+      in mu - mimo bc systems , the overall performance depends on how efficiently the resource allocation algorithms manage the hyper - dimensional pool of resources ( carriers , time slots , codes , power , antennas , users , etc . ) .",
    "consider a system with a transmitter equipped with @xmath18 antennas , and let @xmath25 be the set of all active users , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system - processing - blocks ] . to qualitatively determine the objectives of scheduling , we provide the following definitions :    [ defn : quality - of - service ] _ quality of service_. we say that qos defines a set of prescribed network-/user - based performance targets ( e.g. , peak rates , error rates , average delays , or queue stability ) , that can be measured , improved , and guaranteed for a specific upper layer application .",
    "[ defn : user_scheduling ] _ user scheduling_. we say that a set of radio resources ( e.g. time slot , codes , sub - channels , powers , etc . ) , has been assigned to a group of scheduled users , @xmath26 , so that a global performance metric is optimized subject to power and qos constraints . moreover",
    ", each user @xmath27 , achieves non - zero rate with successful information reception .",
    "consider that each user @xmath28 , is equipped with @xmath29 antennas . by having more receive than transmit antennas ( @xmath30 )",
    ", one can solve a selection problem to achieve mudiv gains in fading fluctuating channels @xcite . a fundamental task in resource management",
    "is to select a subset of users @xmath26 , and assign resource to it , so that a given performance metric is optimized . for the sake of illustration , consider a single - transmitter scenario , and let us formulate a general user scheduling problem for a single resource ( sub - carrier , time slot , or code ) as follows :    rrcl & & & _ k = 1 ^k _ ( k ) u_(k ) [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : cost - function ] + & & & _ k = 1^k _ k p_k p [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : total - power ] + & & & 0 _ k p_k p_k  k | [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : individual - power ] + & & & _ k = 1^k _ k c_p [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : set - cardinality ] + & & & _ k \\{0 , 1 }  k | [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : binary - vars ]    our goal is to maximize the sum of the utility functions , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , which depends on several parameters : the multiuser mimo channel , @xmath33 , the allocated power , @xmath34 , the individual data queues , @xmath35 , and the encoding order , @xmath36 .",
    "the qos requirements can be included in the definition of @xmath31 , as individual weights [ cf .",
    "section  [ section : performance - uf ] ] .",
    "equations ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : total - power ] ) and ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : individual - power ] ) define total and individual power constraints , which are set according to the scenario [ cf . section  [ section : system - set - ups ] ] .",
    "the term @xmath37 is a binary variable with value equal to 1 if the @xmath38-th user is scheduled and 0 otherwise .",
    "the set of selected user is given by @xmath39 .",
    "the system operates in mu - mimo mode if @xmath40 , where @xmath41 in ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : set - cardinality ] ) denotes the maximum number of users or transmitted data streams , that can be sent over @xmath18 antennas .",
    "if the solution of ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : cost - function ] ) only exists for @xmath42 , the system operates in su - mimo mode .",
    "in such a case , the optimization problem can be formulated to attain mudiv , multiplexing ( high rate ) , and diversity ( high reliability ) gains , see @xcite .",
    "depending on the csit , the type of signaling design and coding applied to the data , theoretical analysis show that the number of users with optimal nonzero power is upper bounded and it becomes loose as the number of transmit antennas grow large .",
    "numerical results comparing the upper bound of @xmath43 for several coding techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "] as @xmath44 , @xcite . in practical systems ,",
    "multiplexing gain can be scaled up to @xmath45 , by means of linear signal processing [ cf .",
    "section  [ section : precoding : linear ] ] .    the mathematical formulation in ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : cost - function ] ) resembles a knapsack or subset - sum problem @xcite , which is known to be non - polynomial time complete ( np - c ) .",
    "although the users are fixed items that must be chosen to construct @xmath46 , their associated utility functions change according to the channel conditions and the resource allocation of the co - selected users .",
    "this implies that the optimization variables are , in general , globally coupled . finding the optimal set @xmath46 , is a combinatorial problem due to the binary variables @xmath47 , and the encoding order @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , depending on @xmath48 , problem ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : cost - function ] ) might deal with non - convex functions on the multiple parameters , e.g. @xmath21 , @xmath18 , @xmath29 , etc .",
    "the feasibility of ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : cost - function ] ) relies on the constraints and processing , e.g. the precoding schemes , the power allocation , the csit accuracy , @xcite , [ cf .",
    "section  [ section : performance - uf ] ] .",
    "the scheduling problem can be solved optimally by exhaustively searching ( exs ) over all possible set sizes and user permutations . however , the computational complexity of exs is prohibitively high , even for small values of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , problem ( [ eq : general - combinatorial - problem : cost - function ] ) can be modified to include additional dimensions , such as multiple carriers for ofdma systems ( e.g. @xcite ) or codes for cdma systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "channel knowledge at the transmitter can be modeled taking into account instantaneous or statistical information , e.g. variance , covariance , angles of arrival / departure , and dominant path in line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "there are two main strategies used to obtain csi , reciprocity and feedback , which provide different feedback requirements and robustness to csi errors .",
    "the former , known as open - loop feedback , uses uplink channel information to define the downlink channel in the next transmission interval .",
    "it is suitable for tdd since transmit directions are in identical frequencies , and the channel can be reversed .",
    "the latter , known as closed - loop feedback , requires sending the downlink channel to the transmitter using dedicated pilots , and is commonly used in fdd .",
    "the majority of the papers reviewed in section  [ section : algorithms ] assume closed - loop with full or limited channel feedback , and we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein for further discussion on csi acquisition and its impact on system performance .    to perform multiple antenna processing , interference mitigation , user scheduling , efficient power allocation , and to profit from mudiv ,",
    "knowledge of csit is compulsory .",
    "the complete lack of csit reduces the multiplexing gain to one , and can not use mudiv for boosting the achievable capacity @xcite . in such scenarios , the optimum resource allocation and transmission schemes",
    "are performed over orthogonal dimensions @xcite . in the literature of mu - mimo ,",
    "a large number of works assume full csi ( error - free ) , at both the receiver ( csir ) and transmitter ( csit ) sides . in practical systems ,",
    "a strong downlink pilot channel , provided by the transmitter , is available to the users , hence the csir estimation error is negligible relative to that of the csit @xcite . for simplicity , it is widely assumed that csir is perfectly known at the mobile terminals .    achieving full csit ( ideal noiseless and delay - free feedback ) is highly challenging in practice . feeding",
    "back the csi requires rates that grow rapidly with the transmit power and the number of antennas @xcite .",
    "however , by assuming full csit , it is possible to derive upper bounds on the performance of different signal processing techniques and scheduling algorithms .",
    "the information - theoretic and numerical results using full csit provide useful insights regarding the system performance bounds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "resource allocation strategies that optimize spectral efficiency , fairness , power consumption , and error probability can be designed to characterize optimal operating points @xcite .",
    "analytical results for full csit reveal the role of each parameter in the system , e.g. , number of deployed transmit and receive antennas , number of active users , snr regime , etc .    if channel knowledge is obtained via partial ( rate - limited ) feedback , the information available at the transmitter has finite resolution , resulting in quantization errors .",
    "_ partial csit _ is comprised of two quantities : channel quality information ( cqi ) and channel direction information ( cdi ) @xcite .",
    "the cqi measures the achievable sinr , the channel magnitude , or any other function of the link quality .",
    "the cdi is the quantized version of the original channel direction , which is determined using codebooks [ cf .",
    "section  [ section : precoding : partial - csit ] ] .",
    "the transmitter uses both indicators for scheduling [ cf .",
    "section  [ section : algorithms : selection - partial - csit ] ] , and the cqi is particularly used for power control , link adaptation , and interference management @xcite .",
    "the csi feedback interval highly depends on the users mobility , and even for short - range communications ( e.g. , wifi ) , immediate feedback is needed to achieve and maintain good performance @xcite . by considering high mobility and limited feedback rates , one can not rely on instantaneous or full csi . in such cases ,",
    "the transmitters perform resource allocation based on _ statistical _ csi , which vary over larger time scales than the instantaneous csi .",
    "the statistics for the downlink and uplink are reciprocal in both fdd and tdd , which can be used to perform resource allocation , see @xcite and references therein .",

    "we have classified the scenarios in two groups , see fig .  [",
    "fig : generic - deployments ] : single transmitter and multiple transmitters scenarios .    the implemented resource allocation strategies , user scheduling , and signal processing techniques depend on the number of coordinated transmitters , the number of antennas ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , the number of users ( @xmath21 ) , the snr regime , and the csit accuracy .",
    "the system optimization relies on close - loop ( e.g. @xcite ) or open - loop ( e.g. @xcite ) feedback , to achieve spatial multiplexing gains , multiuser diversity gains , and to combat interference . in cellular systems , there are two main sources of interference @xcite : other active devices in the same co - channel and same cell , i.e. , intra - cell or iui ; and from transmissions in other cells , i.e. , inter - cell interference ( ici ) . the techniques to mitigate iui and ici depend on the type of scenario and the optimization criterion .",
    "there exist a number of scenarios where the interference can not be reduced , see @xcite , whose characteristics are described in the following definition :    [ defn : interference - limited - system ] _ interference - limited system_. an mu - mimo system is said to be interference limited if the performance metric saturates ( ceiling effect ) with the transmit snr .",
    "this might occur due to csit inaccuracy , highly correlated multiuser channels ( iui ) , and irreducible ici .",
    "+      the objective of mu - mimo processing is to accommodate many users per resource .",
    "therefore , resource allocation strategies are commonly analyzed at the basic resource unit , e.g. , code , single - carrier , time - slot , or frequency - time resource block .",
    "this can be done regardless the global system model ( single - carrier , ofdm , or cdma ) , since the same resource allocation strategy is applied over all resources , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we adopt a signal model using the most general approach in the reviewed references .",
    "consider a scenario where the transmitter is equipped with @xmath18 antennas , and @xmath21 active users are equipped with @xmath19 antennas .",
    "let @xmath49 , be the discrete - time complex baseband mimo channel of the @xmath23-th user for a given carrier .",
    "the received signal can be expressed as :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 , is the joint transmitted signal for all users .",
    "the mimo channel is usually assumed to be ergodic , i.e. , it evolves over time and frequency in an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d .",
    "the channel is commonly modeled as _",
    "rayleigh fading _",

    "entries with distribution @xmath55 .",
    "assuming spatially uncorrelated rayleigh fading channels , i.e. , @xmath56 , @xmath32 and some @xmath57 , is the most common practice in the literature @xcite .",
    "physically , this implies rich scattering environments with sufficient antenna spacing at both ends of the radio link @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the fading paths between the multi - antenna transmitter and receiver become independent .",
    "the mu - mimo channels are modeled as narrow band , experiencing frequency - flat ( constant ) fading , where there is no inter - symbol interference @xcite .",
    "a common simplification used in ofdm broadband systems , is to assume multiple flat - fading sub - channels @xcite .",
    "the received signal per sub - channel can be modeled as ( [ eq : received_signal ] ) , avoiding frequency selectivity @xcite .",
    "more realistic channel models for broadband mimo systems and their performance analysis were proposed in @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh model can be thought as a particular case of the asymmetric _ ricean fading _ channel model . in this case , the entries of @xmath54 have non - zero mean and there exists a dominant line - of - sight ( los ) component that increases the average snr @xcite .",
    "several authors model the mimo channel such that the correlation at transmit and receive antennas is distinguishable , and @xmath58 , @xmath32 , see references in table  [ tab : channel - information ] .",
    "there are two approaches to model and analyze performance under mimo correlation , the _ jointly correlated model _ @xcite and the simplified _ kronecker model _ @xcite .",
    "the former assumes separability between transmit and receive eigen - directions , and characterizes their mutual dependence .",
    "the latter assumes complete correlation separability between the transmitter and receiver arrays , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive analysis of rayleigh and rician correlated mu - mimo channels .",
    "note that in some mimo propagation scenarios with uncorrelated antennas , the mimo capacity can be low as compared to the siso one due to the _ keyhole _ or _ pinhole _ effect .",
    "this is related to environments where rich scattering around the transmitter and receiver leads to low correlation of the signals , while other propagation effects , like diffraction or waveguiding , lead to a rank reduction of the transfer function matrix @xcite .",
    "the mimo channels @xmath59 , may also include large - scale fading effects due to shadowing and path loss @xcite . depending on the type of access technique ( ofdma , cdma , or tdma ) , the channel model can take into account multi - path components , correlation , doppler spread , and angular properties @xcite .",
    "another common assumption to avoid frequency dependency ( particularly in low mobility scenarios ) , is to account for _ block - fading channels _",
    "this means that the csi is constant ( within a coherence time duration ) for a block of consecutive channel uses before changing independently for the next block .",
    "the noise @xmath60 , is usually modeled by i.i.d .",
    "normalized entries according to a circular normal ( complex ) gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance @xcite .",
    "the transmitted signal , @xmath61 , can be defined according to the encoding applied over the user data , the number of spatial streams per user , and the power allocation . if linear precoding is used [ cf .",
    "section  [ section : precoding ] ] , the transmitted signal is defined as    @xmath62    where @xmath63 , is the precoding matrix , @xmath64 is the data signal , and @xmath65 is the number of multiplexed data streams of user @xmath23 . in single - transmitter mu - mimo scenarios with signal models defined by ( [ eq : received_signal ] ) and ( [ eq : transmitted_signal ] ) ,",
    "the ici is negligible or assumed to be part of the additive background noise .",
    "therefore , iui is the main performance limiting factor , which can be addressed by precoding the user data , [ cf .",
    "section  [ section : precoding ] ] .",
    "the active users might experience similar average long - term channel gains ( large - scale fading or path loss ) and snr regimes .",
    "for some practical cellular systems , assuming homogeneous users is valid if open - loop power control is used to compensate for cell - interior and cell - edge path losses .",
    "therefore , the resultant effective multiuser channels have quasi - identical variances @xcite .",
    "the user distribution affects the fading statistics of @xmath66 @xmath32 , and the general design of resource allocation algorithms @xcite .",
    "a possible single - transmitter mu - mimo scenario arises in satellite communications .",

    "<S> remarkable research activities and major advances have been occurred over the past decade in multiuser multiple - input multiple - output ( mu - mimo ) systems . several transmission technologies and precoding techniques </S>",
    "<S> have been developed in order to exploit the spatial dimension so that simultaneous transmission of independent data streams reuse the same radio resources . </S>",
    "<S> the achievable performance of such techniques heavily depends on the channel characteristics of the selected users , the amount of channel knowledge , and how efficiently interference is mitigated . in systems where the total number of receivers is larger than the number of total transmit antennas , user selection becomes a key approach to benefit from multiuser diversity and achieve full multiplexing gain . </S>",
    "<S> the overall performance of mu - mimo systems is a complex joint multi - objective optimization problem since many variables and parameters have to be optimized , including the number of users , the number of antennas , spatial signaling , rate and power allocation , and transmission technique . </S>",
    "<S> the objective of this literature survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the various methodologies used to approach the aforementioned joint optimization task in the downlink of mu - mimo communication systems .    </S>",
