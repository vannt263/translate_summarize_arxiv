    "spin - dependent electronic transport and use of the spin degree of freedom of electrons in hybrid magnetic structures have recently been subject of highly interesting field termed spintronics .",
    "this developing field has emerged from many exciting phenomena , the giant magneto - resistance being the most well known example , which has made it attractive for applications as well as fundamental studies @xcite .",
    "typical studied systems are based on the use of ferromagnetic metals ( f ) and/or external magnetic fields to inject , manipulate and detect spin - polarized electrons inside a mesoscopic normal metal ( n ) .",
    "an important characteristic of mesoscopic systems is the appearance of shot noise , the fluctuations of current through the system due to the randomness of the electronic scattering processes and the quantum statistics . shot noise and nonlocal correlations of the current fluctuations contain additional information on the conduction process which is not gainable through a mean current measurement .",
    "in ferromagnetic - normal metal structures , in which the spin of electrons plays an essential rule , current fluctuations are due to the randomness of both charge and spin transport processes .",
    "thus , shot noise measurements are expected to provide information about spin - dependent scattering processes and spin accumulation in the system .",
    "together with the importance of noise in spintronic devices in view of applications this motivates our study of spin - polarized shot noise .    in the past years",
    ", shot noise has been extensively studied in a wide variety of hybrid structures involving normal metals , semiconductors and superconductors@xcite . however , there are few studies devoted to shot noise in ferromagnet - normal metal systems . results of earlier studies of current fluctuations in fnf double barrier systems in the coulomb blockade regime@xcite and fif ( i being an insulator ) systems @xcite can be understood in terms of well known results for the corresponding normal - metal systems for two spin directions@xcite .",
    "tserkovnyak and brataas studied shot noise in double barrier fnf systems with noncollinear magnetizations in f - terminals @xcite .",
    "they found that the shot noise has a non - monotonic behavior with respect to the relative angle of the magnetizations for different scattering regimes and different types of fn junctions .",
    "the effect of spin flip scattering on spin - polarized current fluctuations has been considered in refs . .",
    "mishchenko @xcite found that in a perfectly polarized two - terminal double barrier system spin - flip scattering leads to a strong dependence of shot noise on the relative orientation of the magnetizations in f - terminals . in ref .",
    "we have proposed a four - terminal spin - valve system of tunnel junctions to study spin - dependent shot noise and cross- correlations simultaneously .",
    "it has been found that the cross - correlations between currents in terminals with opposite spin polarization can be used to measure directly the spin - flip scattering rate .",
    "recently , there have been also studies of the current fluctuations of spin - polarized entangled electrons in quantum dots and wires @xcite and in quantum dots attached to the ferromagnetic leads in the coulomb blockade @xcite , kondo @xcite and sequential tunneling @xcite regimes .    in this paper , we study current fluctuations in a three terminal diffusive fnf system in the full range of spin polarizations and the spin - flip scattering intensity .",
    "based on the boltzmann - langevin @xcite kinetic approach , we develop a semiclassical theory for spin - polarized transport in the presence of the spin - flip scattering . we obtain the basic equations of charge and spin transport , which allow the calculation of mean currents and the correlations of current fluctuations in multi - terminal diffusive systems . applying the developed formalism to a three - terminal geometry , we find that current correlations are affected strongly by spin - flip scattering and spin polarizations .",
    "we focus on the shot noise of the total current through the system and the cross - correlations measured between currents of two terminals .",
    "we demonstrate how these correlations deviate from the noise characteristics of the unpolarized system , depending on the spin - flip scattering rate , the polarizations of the terminals and their magnetic configurations ( relative directions ) .",
    "our results provide a full analysis for spin - dependent shot noise and cross - correlations in terms of the relevant parameters .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we extend the boltzmann - langevin equations to the diffusive systems , in which spin - flip scattering takes place and which are connected to ferromagnetic terminals .",
    "we find the basic equations of the charge and the spin currents and the correlations of their fluctuations .",
    "in section iii we apply this formalism to the three terminal system .",
    "we obtain the fano factor and the cross - correlations between currents through two different terminals .",
    "section vi is devoted to the analysis of the calculated quantities .",
    "we present analytical expressions for the fano factor and the cross - correlations in different important limits .",
