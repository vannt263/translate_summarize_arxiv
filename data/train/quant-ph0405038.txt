    "entanglement plays an important role in quantum information processing for transmitting unknown quantum states via noisy channels from a sender to a receiver , such as quantum teleportation@xcite , quantum data compression@xcite , and quantum super - dense coding@xcite , etc .. to achieve a reliable transmission of the unknown states , pure maximally entangled pairs , typically the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs , or the bell - states , which are emerged from a quantum resource and transmitted through a quantum channel , should be shared by the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) .",
    "because of the presence of noise in the quantum channel , alice and bob therefore have to perform actions such as entanglement purification procedures in distilling pure entangled states from a larger number of impure entangled states . the entanglement purification protocol ( epp )",
    "allows alice and bob to perform local unitary transformations and measurements and even allows them to coordinate their actions through one - way or two - way classical communication .",
    "it , however , does not allow alice and bob to perform non - local actions nor to transmit fresh quantum states from one to the other .",
    "an epp involving two - way communication is called a two - way epp ( 2-epp ) , in which both alice and bob need to know the results of measurement from each other .",
    "typical 2-epps include the ibm protocol@xcite and the oxford protocol@xcite , which also belong to the recurrence method . on the other hand , a one - way epp ( 1-epp )",
    "requires only alice to send her measurement result through classical channel to bob , who when combining it with his own result can decide a following action to perform .",
    "thus , the 1-epp can produce pure maximally entangled pairs which are separated both in space and in time .",
    "the hashing protocol@xcite and the breeding protocol@xcite are examples of the 1-epp .    normally , the 2-epp can be combined with the 1-epp , such as a recurrence - hashing protocol , to produce a higher purification yield , defined by a ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of the purified useful pairs and @xmath2 is the number of the input impure pairs .",
    "it is well known that if the final fidelity of the purified states @xmath3 , i.e. , if the the final state is almost of the wanted pure state , is required , then the initial number of the impure pairs should be @xmath4 for both the 1-epp and 2-epp . as shown by bennett et al.@xcite , the pure one way hashing and breeding protocols can produce a non - zero yield only when the fidelity of the purified states possessed by the input impure pairs is greater than @xmath5 .",
    "even the best 1-epp , proposed by shor and smolin@xcite , can do the job only when the initial fidelity of the purified states exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "when the 2-epps are performed , on the other hand , the input state becomes distillable if its fidelity of the purified states is greater than @xmath7@xcite@xcite .",
    "so , in these senses , the 2-epps perform better than the 1-epp when they are only used in conjunction with teleportation in offering a means of transmitting quantum information through noisy channels .",
    "the 1-epp , however , by producing time - separated entanglement , can additionally be used to protect quantum states during storage in a noisy environment .",
    "this important feature then leads to the consequence that the 1-epp , when combined with quantum teleportation , can always permit the creation of a quantum error - correcting code ( qecc ) .",
    "bennett et al.@xcite have presented the equivalence between the 1-epp and qecc .",
    "the qecc derived from a 1-epp will have a code - rate equal to the yield of the 1-epp and have a fidelity equal to the fidelity of the purified states produced by the 1-epp .",
    "the one - way hashing protocol therefore can be interpreted as an error - correcting code which protects an arbitrary state in @xmath8-dimensional hilbert space from noise by employing qubit block of asymptotically large size @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the qecc derived from the one - way hashing protocol actually does its job better than the qeccs based on the linear - code theory of calderbank and shor@xcite and steane@xcite in the sense that it has a higher rate than the latter ones .",
    "nevertheless , as most of the qeccs [ 8 - 16 ] focused on employing qubits of finite block size @xmath9 in protecting @xmath10 qubits from any error on no more than @xmath11 qubits , bennett et al.@xcite have further discussed the possibility of transforming the 1-epp into a qecc in the same manner .",
    "they ended up with a qecc by showing how finite blocks of 5 epr pairs can be purified in the presence of noise which only affects at most one of the bell states .",
    "the theory of quantum error - corrections independently presented by knill and laflamme@xcite has proved the block size @xmath12 is the smallest and best case .",
    "so far , a 5-qubit , single - error - correcting code has been performed experimentally@xcite .    in the 5-epr pair , single - error - correcting quantum block code",
    ", there are totally 16 possible blocks of bell state ( i.e. , 16 error syndromes ) to be dealt with ; one corresponds to the bell states without error and the remaining ones are those with one of three errors on only one of the five bell states . when the block of bell states is coded as a string of phase - amplitude bits , the quantum error - correction problem then turns out to create a classical boolean function which can map exactly one on one the syndrome states onto others such that the first bell state ( if the five bell states are numbered in order ) is always the same when the remaining four are measured and found out to be the same .",
    "associated with the boolean function , there is a sequence of basic operations including uni - lateral and bi - lateral rotations acting on one bell state and bi - lateral xors ( controlled - nots ) acting on two bell states to realize the qecc protocol .",
    "in fact , there are so many possible boolean functions , and therefore so many corresponding sequences of operations , for such qecc protocols ; some of them are more economic and feasible than the others because they need the least operations to complete the qecc procedures .",
    "bennett et al.@xcite have introduced the monte carlo method to numerically find out possible boolean functions by randomly choosing the sequence of operations acting on randomly chosen states . implementing the numerical mote carlo method",
    ", however , is not a systematic way and therefore is hard to find out all possible boolean functions to complete the theory of the 5-epr - pair qecc .",
    "based on this reason , we are intended in this work to present a systemic method for establishing the boolean functions and their corresponding sequences of operations for such qeccs .    the mote carlo method is a forward way of serial trial and error , i.e. , during the procedure of creating the boolean function , the mapped states of the @xmath13 syndromes are consecutively checked to see if the boolean words for measurement embedded in them are independent . in our method ,",
    "an array of the independent boolean words for measurements is prescribed , and then in the opposite direction of the monte carlo method , boolean functions are established consistently in an easy way very similar to the transformation of an invertible matrix into the identity matrix by performing elementary row operations on the matrices following the theory of linear algebra . since the transformation of a matrix",
    "is physically controlled by the operations mentioned above , the sequence of operations associated with the established boolean function can be decided accordingly .",
    "it is therefore very easy to find out a boolean function and its corresponding sequence of operations analytically and all possible solutions according to the prescribed array of boolean words for measurement can be found if aided by a numerical program . in the next section , we will describe the derivation of the qecc from the 1-epp used to purify a bell state from a finite block of 5 bell states .",
    "in section 3 , we then describe in detail the systematic method for creating boolean functions in the qecc .",
    "a typical example of the boolean function is given to help interpreting the procedure of our method . in section 4 ,",
    "more results are given to show the capability of the present method and a brief discussion is also presented .",
    "a conclusion is given in the final section .",
    "the single - error - correcting code considered herein is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 , which plots the combination of the 1-epp that purify finite blocks of five epr pairs and the teleportation that safely transmit arbitrary states .",
    "alice first prepares mixed states @xmath14 by passing halves of one standard state among the bell states @xmath15 and @xmath16 from source e and through noisy channel . for convenience ,",
    "the state @xmath17 is considered as the standard bell state in this work .",
    "the mixed state @xmath14 is bell diagonal under the restriction that the noise model is one - sided ( i.e. , n@xmath18 is absent ) , or effectively one - sided@xcite .",
    "( in fact , any noise can be made effectively one - sided as a twirling operation performed by alice and bob can convert any bipartite mixed state into a bell diagonal states or a werner state . )",
    "alice and bob then perform the 1-epp to yield perfectly entangled states ( * , which may be singlets @xmath19 or any one of the triplets @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) used to teleport an arbitrary state @xmath22 safely from alice to bob , completing a qecc . in developing the theory of the 5-epr - pair single - error - correcting code first introduced by bennett et al.@xcite , the four bell states are first coded as classical two - bit words , which read    @xmath23    here the left bits are high - order or phase bits used to identify the @xmath24 property and the right bits are low - order or amplitude bits used to identify the @xmath25 property .",
    "consequently , each finite block of five bell states used in the present qecc then can be represented by a ten - bit word , for example , @xmath26 since only single error is allowed in the present model , and the error could be either a phase error ( @xmath27 ) , an amplitude error ( @xmath28 ) , or both ( @xmath29)@xcite@xcite , therefore , after the action of noise n@xmath30 , there is a set of totally 16 possible ten - bit words defining the complete set of error syndromes to be dealt with .",
    "the error syndrome words are denoted by 16 boolean valued ( @xmath31 ) vectors @xmath32 , @xmath33 in a ten - dimensional vector space . clearly",
    ", if we denote the null vector in the vector space by @xmath34 , which represents the no - error state , and the three states in which the single error occurs on bell state @xmath35 , @xmath36 , by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively , then the 16 error syndrome vectors can be subdivided into 5 four - groups denoted by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the identity element and the property @xmath42 holds ( @xmath43 is the addition modulo 2 ) . excluding the null vector @xmath41 , two distinct elements arbitrarily chosen from each of the 5 four - groups @xmath44 are independent to those chosen from the other four - groups , so 10 independent vectors can be chosen from the 5 four - groups to form a set of basis vectors spanning the 10-dimensional boolean valued vector space . meanwhile , all four - bit boolean valued vectors , totally 16 and each denoted by @xmath45 in accord with error syndrome @xmath46 , can also be subdivided into 5 four - groups @xmath47 , which are one - to - one isomorphic to the four - groups @xmath44 in the same manner that @xmath48 and    @xmath49    one example of the correspondence between the four - groups @xmath50 and @xmath44 is shown in table 1 .    the 5-epr - pair , single - error - correcting code then demands alice and bob to apply unitary transformations @xmath51 and @xmath52 in mapping @xmath32 onto other two - bit words @xmath53 which , when four of the five bell states in a block are locally measured , should yield results represented by @xmath54 thus the 16 vectors @xmath53 should also be subdivided into 5 four - groups @xmath55 accordingly .",
    "the measurement results should be distinguished by reading the low bits of the measured bell states so the ten - bit word @xmath56 in fact has its four low bits of the measured bell states denoted by @xmath45 . without loss of generality , in what follows the four components of @xmath45",
    "are located at the 4@xmath57 6@xmath57 8@xmath57 and 10@xmath58 components of @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the state of the remaining unmeasured epr pair then is represented by a truncated word @xmath59 , the first two bits of the vector @xmath60 for every error syndrome @xmath46 .",
    "a successful error - correction should require that , whatever @xmath61 is , bob can always perform a corresponding rotation @xmath62 on it and restore it to the standard state @xmath63 , or any one of the other bell states , after learning the measurement results @xmath54 the unilateral rotation @xmath62 performed by bob can be either one element of the pauli group @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 which , if the remaining unmeasured bell state is to be restored to the standard @xmath17 , for example , can do the transformations    @xmath68    respectively .    the unmeasured bell states , coded by @xmath69 , and the corresponding pauli rotations @xmath62 , can be decided by bob after he has learned the measurement results @xmath70 if both alice and bob have pre - agreed with prescribed unitary transformation @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which represent a sequence of unilateral and bilateral operations performing the transformations @xmath71 . in epps , and in the qeccs derived from them",
    ", a bell state is transformed into another under some typical unitary operations performed by either alice or bob , but not both , and bilateral operations that require both alice and bob to perform a same transformation on their spins .",
    "the typical unilateral operations include the pauli transformations @xmath65 @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which perform a @xmath74 rotation of alice or bob s spin about the @xmath75- , @xmath76-,and @xmath77-axis , respectively .",
    "the typical bilateral operations , on the other hand , can be either the operations denoted by @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 that require both alice and bob to perform a @xmath81 rotation of their spins in an epr pair about the @xmath75- , @xmath76-,and @xmath77-axis , respectively , or a bilateral xor ( bxor ) that requires both alice and bob to perform a controlled not operation on their spins in common source and target pairs . in the present 5-epr - pair qecc",
    ", however , alice and bob are only confined to performing a sequence of four particular operations which can do anything required in the transformations @xmath71 .",
    "the four basic operations include : ( 1 ) a bxor , which , in our classical bit representation , performs the transformation @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , where the subscripts @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the source and target pairs , respectively ; ( 2 ) a bilateral @xmath81 rotation @xmath79 , which performs @xmath87 @xmath88 ; ( 3 ) a composite operation @xmath89 , which performs @xmath87 @xmath90 ; and ( 4 ) a unilateral @xmath74 rotation @xmath73 , which complements the high bit of an epr pair , viz . , @xmath87 @xmath91    the effect of such a sequence of the four basic operations mentioned above is to apply a linear boolean function mapping @xmath32 onto @xmath53 , which can  also be written by a matrix equation    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is a @xmath94 inversible matrix ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) defined in the 10-dimensional boolean valued vector space and the boolean valued vector @xmath96 corresponds to the mapping of the null vector @xmath41 , @xmath97 . without loss of generality , in what follows ,",
    "@xmath98 is assumed so that the unilateral operation @xmath73 can be excluded from the sequence of operations , i.e. , the boolean function is reduced to be    @xmath99    where the null vector @xmath41 thus remains unchanged under the transformation .",
    "usually , an @xmath100dimensional vector is represented by an @xmath101 column matrix , then eq . ( 5 ) in fact implies    @xmath102    with    @xmath103 , \\ ] ]    @xmath104 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath37 , @xmath107 , @xmath36 .",

    "since each column of the matrix @xmath111 ( 7 ) should have its @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 components forming a measurement - result vector , an array for the measurement results can be written by    @xmath116   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { \\bf m}_{vw}{\\bf m}_{w},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath117 .\\ ] ]    in order to achieve a successful error - correction , the ten measurement - result vectors @xmath118 and @xmath119 appearing in @xmath120 ( 9 ) , the distinct five vectors @xmath121 derived from eq .",

    "the main issue in the theory of the present qecc now turns out to be the creation of a boolean function @xmath71 , or simply the creation of the matrix @xmath111 ( 7 ) , the effect of a specific sequence of the basic operations bxor , @xmath79 , and @xmath89 . to create boolean functions ,",
    "bennett et al.@xcite performed a monte carlo computer search for the corresponding sequence of the four basic operations representing the actions of unitary transformations @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "their program randomly selects one of the four basic operations and randomly selects a bell state or pair of bell states to which to apply the operation .",
    "then the program checks if the resulting set of states @xmath53 results in the success of an error - correction ; if not , the program then repeats the procedure by adding another random operation .",
    "basically , the approach that bennett et al .",
    "implemented is a tedious numerical method of trial and error performing the transformation @xmath124 subject to a ",
    "forward  sequence of the four basic operations . in this work",
    ", we will present an analytical method for creating boolean functions implemented in the present qecc .",
    "the method to be introduced is in fact an inverse way to the monte carlo method . in the method , the inverse transformation @xmath125  is considered to be performed subject to a ",
    "backward  sequence of operations , which is exactly in reverse order of the  forward  one corresponding to the transformation @xmath124  because each basic operation used in the qecc is its own inverse operation .",
    "the present method will be described in detail in the following section .",
    "in deducing the analytical method for creating boolean functions for the 5-epr - pair , single -error - correcting code , the @xmath94 matrix @xmath111 is sometimes rewritten in an alternative form of a @xmath126 matrix whose elements are @xmath127 matrices , namely , the matrix can be expressed by    @xmath128 , \\ ] ]    where the rows enumerate the five bell states in a block and the columns correspond to the five four - groups @xmath55 , respectively . similarly , the original @xmath94 matrix @xmath108 can also be rewritten in a form of @xmath126 matrix , such that each column and each row of the @xmath126 matrix will have one @xmath127 element of determinant 1 and four @xmath127 zero matrices .",
    "now , if an array of the measurement result vectors suitable for a successful error - correction is prescribed , the job in principle is to perform the transformation @xmath125 using elementary row operations on the matrix subject to the effect of a sequence of the basic operations bxor , @xmath79 , and @xmath89 .    the first step of the present method is to designate a suitable array of the measurement result vectors @xmath45 , in which the five four - groups @xmath50 are constructed . in this work ,",
    "the array of @xmath45 shown in ( 11 ) is taken as the designation and then a suitable matrix @xmath111 is assumed for a successful error - correction .",

    "again , if we in the second stage of row operations interchange the operating order of the two bxor s shown in fig.2(b ) , then we will instead in this stage have 5 solutions subgrouped into 3 cases . the solution of case ( a1@xmath190 ) will be missed in this situation , so we should consider the general cases given by ( 30)-(32 ) , which lead to the 6 solutions ( 33)-(38 ) .",
    "now , let us consider the case ( a1@xmath191 ) . using the result shown in ( 33 )",
    ", we first perform the transformations @xmath192 and @xmath193 @xmath194 subject to suitable corresponding operations , then when letting the transformations @xmath195 @xmath196 to occur we obtain the final result for the remaining unknowns @xmath167 and @xmath133 for @xmath197 @xmath198 @xmath199 10 .",

    "summarizing the results ( 39 ) , ( 33 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 16 ) , incorporated with ( 25 ) , ( 26 ) , ( 18 ) , and ( 19 ) , we now can construct the boolean function for the case ( a1@xmath191 ) at the end of the final stage of row operations , in which the obtained matrix @xmath205 is expressed by    @xmath206 , \\ ] ]    which is exactly the same as the one given by bennett et al.@xcite ( shown in eq .",
    "( 77 ) of their article ) .",
    "a whole sequence of basic operations , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , is obtained by combining the three sub - sequences shown in figs .",
    "2(a)-(c ) , which will transform the matrix @xmath207 ( 40 ) into the matrix @xmath108 expressed by    @xmath208 .\\ ] ]    reading the sequence of operations shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , and all in other figures , we should keep in mind that a  backwardtransformation @xmath125  is accomplished by performing the operations in the order from left to right , while a  forward ",
    "transformation @xmath124 is implied to be undertaken by performing the operations exactly in the reverse order , i.e. , from right to left .",
    "the rule of row operations on a given matrix @xmath111 , such as the one shown in ( 40 ) , however , indicates that we can transform the given matrix @xmath111 in several ways into its corresponding @xmath108 s , implying there are several sequences of operations which can convert the same given matrix @xmath111 to distinct @xmath108 s . most importantly , this also implies that we can seek a best sequence of operations which consists of either the least number of total operations or the least number of the bxor operations alone , under a fixed correspondence between the unmeasured states ( the codewords in the first two rows of the given @xmath94 @xmath111 ) and the prescribed measurement result vectors ( embedded in @xmath111 ) obtained from the given @xmath111 .",
    "so , the final step of our method is to seek a shortened sequence of operations according to the rule of row operations on the matrix @xmath209 obtained in the preceding step .",
    "this step begins with the  startingsequence of operations constructed simply by combining the three sub - sequences used in the preceding step in obtaining a specific matrix @xmath111 for a successful error - correction .",
    "a systematic way to shorten the starting sequence of operations , is to re - display the complete row operations in transforming the specific @xmath111 into its corresponding @xmath108 s under all the permutations of the bxor s appearing in the starting sequence .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3(b ) an example of the shortened sequence of operations involved in transforming the matrix @xmath111 shown in ( 40 ) into the matrix    @xmath210\\ ] ]    clearly , the new version shown in fig 3 ( b ) is a result obtained when we interchange the first two bxor s in the original sequence of operations shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) ; it consists of only ten operations in which seven bxor s are required .",
    "the two sequences shown in fig . 3 are of course different , resulting in distinct @xmath108 s , as shown in ( 41 ) and ( 42 ) , but they are equivalent because they both lead to the same correspondence between the unmeasured states and the prescribed measurement result vectors , as tabulated in table 2 and named by case ( a1@xmath191 ) .",
    "in the preceding section we have shown the complete procedure for creating boolean functions involved in the present 5-epr pair , single -error - correcting code .",
    "we have given an example of the boolean functions derived by using the present method , namely , the given matrix @xmath111 in ( 40 ) and its best corresponding sequence of operations shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . to show more examples , we have also analyzed the cases ( a1@xmath211 ) , ( a1@xmath212 ) , ( a1@xmath190 ) , ( a1@xmath213 ) , and ( a1@xmath214 ) , in which the choices ( 16 ) , ( 23 ) , and ( 33)-(38 ) are taken , respectively .",
    "their final correspondences between the unmeasured bell states and the measurement results are shown in table 2 and the gate arrays of the corresponding sequences of operations are shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the sequence of operations shown in fig .",
    "4(e ) for the case ( a1@xmath214 ) contains only six bxor s , while the others , including the one shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) and those shown in figs .",
    "4(a)-(d ) , all contain seven bxor s . to perform a more reliable error - correcting protocol , we may require to construct a boolean function under the effect of a sequence  of operations containing fewer bxor s since two - bit operations could be more difficult ones to implement in a physical apparatus @xcite , so the sequence of operations for the case ( a1@xmath214 ) may be crucially important .",
    "indeed , there are many boolean functions in which the sequences of operations contain only six bxor s . using our systematic method",
    ", it becomes relatively easier than using the numerical monte carlo method to find out such boolean functions . in principle",
    ", it can be easily done to find sequences containing only six bxor operations if we can skillfully choose suitable solutions and apply operations in suitable order so that more zero elements are present both in the second column of the @xmath126 matrix @xmath164 ( 17 ) and the third column of @xmath126 @xmath215  matrix ( 24 ) .",
    "for instance , if we maintain the same choice ( 16 ) in the first stage of row operations , then choose the solution in which @xmath216 and @xmath217 as one of the cases ( c ) in the second stage of row operations , and finally choose @xmath218 in the final stage of row operations , we eventually will construct a boolean function in which the matrix @xmath209 is given by    @xmath219 , \\ ] ]    and the corresponding sequence of operations is shown in fig .",
    "it is found that such a sequence of operations contains only six bxor s and three other operations ; it is even better than the one in the case ( a1@xmath214 ) since the latter contains six bxor s but four other operations .",
    "the correspondence between the measured bell states and the measurement results of such boolean function is also shown in table 2 , denoted as case ( c1@xmath212 ) .",
    "we have in this work presented some analytical results for the boolean function under the fixed designation of measurement results as given by ( 11 ) and embedded in the assumed matrix shown by ( 13 ) .",
    "if we name all of the solutions that can be obtained under the present designation of measurement results a solution group , then , following the same scenario in deducing the boolean function , we can possibly obtain other solution groups under distinct arrangements of the measurement results .",
    "for example , based on the representation of @xmath126 matrix for the assumed @xmath111 shown in ( 13 ) , we in fact can choose any one of the five columns and locate it at the first column in accord with the confinement in the first stage of row operations interpreted in the preceding section .",
    "so , we conclude that there are totally 5 ",
    "solution groups under such arrangements that can be obtained by using our method . besides",
    ", possible designations of the array of measurement results can also be obtained by performing row operations on the given array ( 11 ) .",
    "the solutions resulted from such designations , however , are distinct but  dependent  to those resulted from the original array ( 11 ) because they are distinct to each other only due to effects of some bxor operations . for example , as we can change the first row of the array ( 11 ) by adding the second row to it and have a reduced array given by    @xmath220 , \\ ] ]    we then have dependent matrices @xmath111  different from those resulted from the designation ( 11 ) by only a bxor operation acting on bell states 2 ( as the target ) and 3 ( as the source ) .    as a final result ,",
    "there are so many possible boolean functions subject to the prescribed array of measurement results ( 11 ) that can be implemented in the 5-epr - pair , single - error - correcting code and they can be analytically derived by our systematic method .",
    "if all these boolean functions are to be established , however , a computer program should be developed following the present scenario to make it practical and feasible .",
    "the computer program to be developed should be capable to determine the suitable matrices m@xmath221then to reconstruct the best sequences of operations for the given matrices , and finally help to select the best boolean functions which can be performed by least basic operations or least bxor s . to develop the computer program , however , is not an issue to be concerned with in this work .",
    "in this work a systematic method has been presented for creating boolean functions required in the 5-epr - pair , single - error - correcting code first introduced by bennett et al.@xcite .",
    "although so far the 5-epr - pair , single - error - correcting code has not been undertaken experimentally , we here have complemented the mathematical theory of the qecc by showing an analytical way for creating the required boolean function .",
    "distinct to the previously used monte carlo computer search , which may consume a lot of trial and error efforts , the present method can help creating the boolean function in an analytical procedure . in the spirit of row operations on a matrix used in the present method , we are also capable to establish the best sequence of basic operations for every given boolean function . we have given some analytical results of the boolean function and the associated sequence of operations using the present method .",
    "some of the results are better than the others because they require fewer number of total operations or fewer number of bxor operations and then can make the qecc more reliable .",
    "the three systematic steps for deducing the present results that have been described in detail in the preceding sections have shown the scenario helpful in creating the boolean function that are potentially useful in the 5-epr - pair qecc . the effort to create all the boolean functions ,",
