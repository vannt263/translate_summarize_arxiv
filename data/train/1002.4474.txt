    "the intrinsic shape of galaxies is interesting from a variety of perspectives . for a given galaxy",
    "the shape should be consistent with the dynamical model of the galaxy , while , for a sample of galaxies , one would expect that a correct evolutionary model should be able to reproduce the observed distribution of shapes .",
    "it is generally assumed that disc galaxies can be approximated to be oblate spheroids ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if one further assumes that the galaxies have a well defined mean axial ratio ( q@xmath4 ) , then the observed axial ratio can be used to determine the inclination of the disc . in turn",
    ", the inclination is a crucial input in dynamical modeling ( e.g. for the mass and structure of the dark matter halo ) , studying the tully - fisher relation etc .",
    "the observed shape of a galaxy differs from the intrinsic shape because of projection effects .",
    "if one has a sample of galaxies drawn from a population with a well defined intrinsic axial ratio distribution and with random orientations with respect to the earth , then one can determine the distribution of intrinsic axial ratios from the observed axial ratio distribution ( for e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth noting that most of these studies have focused on large galaxies , and that there have been relatively few that focused on dwarfs . for bright spiral galaxies",
    ", q@xmath4 is often taken to be @xmath2 ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has also long been appreciated that the axial ratio is a function of hubble type .",
    "for example , @xcite found that while discs get thinner as one goes from galaxies of morphological type sa to sd , there is a rapid increase in disc thickness as one goes from sd to dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that dwarf galaxies from the ugc catalog have q@xmath5 .",
    "axial ratio is also a function of the wavelength of observation .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that older populations as traced by redder stars have thicker ratios than the corresponding b band disc .",
    "but all of these studies refer to the _ stellar _ discs of the galaxies . due to collisions between gas clouds",
    ", one would expect that the gas discs would be intrinsically quite thin , for example , for our galaxy , the scale height of the middle disc is only @xmath6  pc . in extremely gas",
    "rich dwarf galaxies one might then expect that the gas discs are relatively thin , even though the stellar disc may have a large axial ratio .",
    "we present here a study of the axial ratio distribution of the _ hi discs _ of extremely faint dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "we select a sample of galaxies for which hi synthesis observations are available from the faint irregular galaxy gmrt survey ( figgs , @xcite ) .",
    "the sample selection and analysis methods used are presented in section  [ sec : sample ] , while the results are discussed in section  [ sec : dis ] . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first such study of the intrinsic shape of the hi discs of galaxies .",
    "the figgs sample was selected to satisfy the following criteria : ( 1 ) absolute blue magnitude m@xmath7 , ( 2 ) integrated hi flux @xmath8 jy  km / s and ( 3 )  optical major axis @xmath9 .",
    "there are total of 62 galaxies in the figgs sample , for all of which we have axis ratios available .",
    "we discuss the implications of the selection criteria on our derived axis ratio in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] ; here we merely note that any bias in the sample is likely to be towards having a preference for edge on systems .",
    "the figgs survey presents hi images at a range of angular resolutions .",
    "since we are interested in the overall shape of the disc , we measured the axis ratio of the disc using the coarsest resolution hi maps .",
    "this was done because we wanted to avoid the fine structure which shows up at higher resolutions , and instead trace the complete spatial spread of hi which requires observing the less dense gas using coarser resolution .",
    "for all of these galaxies , elliptical isophotes were fit to the hi image using the stsdas package in iraf .",
    "the axis ratio that we use in this paper was measured for the isophote with mean column density @xmath10 @xmath11 for all galaxies .",
    "the measured axial ratio was corrected for the finite beam size before being used .    for a sample of randomly oriented axi - symmetric oblate spheroids , with intrinsic axial ratio distribution @xmath12 , where the axial ratio @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the short axis ( `` thickness '' ) of the spheroid and",
    "@xmath16 the long axis ( `` diameter '' ) , the observed distribution of axis ratios @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the observed axial ratio is given by ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath19    what is available to us is @xmath17   the observed axial ratio distribution ; in order to derive the intrinsic axial ratio distribution @xmath12  , we have to invert eqn .",
    "[ eqn : i1 ] .",
    "@xcite provide an integration formula ( eqn .",
    "( 7 ) in their paper ) in the case that @xmath17   is a polynomial function .",
    "this allows for a direct inversion of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : i1 ] . the binned data ( fig .  [ fig : bind ] )",
    "were hence fit by a polynomial , using a weighted least squares fit .",
    "the errors were assumed to be poisson distributed ( with the error for bins with zero counts taken to be that for a single count ) .",
    "the errors were also estimated using bootstrap resampling .",
    "10000 different realizations of the data were constructed using boot strap resampling , and the 80% confidence limit histograms determined in this way are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the two error estimates are in good agreement .",
    "the direct inversion of the best fit polynomial is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] .",
    "it has a broad peak around q@xmath20 , but also falls to negative values beyond @xmath21 , which is unphysical .",
    "while there may exist an acceptable polynomial fit to @xmath17   which does not produce negatives on inversion , we do not investigate this possibility directly . instead we choose to try to invert eqn .",
    "[ eqn : i1 ] using lucy s deconvolution algorithm @xcite .",
    "this approach has the added advantage of also being able to account for measurement errors .",
    "the lucy deconvolution method is an iterative algorithm for estimating the intrinsic frequency distribution from an observed distribution , subject to the constraints that the deduced distribution should be normalized as well as positive for all values of the intrinsic quantity ( @xmath13 in our case ) .",
    "one starts with an initial guess initial guess for the intrinsic distribution ( @xmath12 ) , and uses a kernel ( @xmath22 , defined by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : a4 ] below ) to iteratively find better approximations to both the apparent distribution and the intrinsic distribution .",
    "if we rewrite eqn .",
    "[ eqn : i1 ] as : @xmath23 then the @xmath24th loop of the iterative algorithm will be , @xmath25 @xmath26    eqn .",
    "[ eqn : a6 ] neglects the measurement errors in determining the observed axial ratio . following @xcite",
    ", we can account for these errors by assuming the following form for the probability @xmath27 , that a galaxy of actual apparent axial ratio @xmath28 is instead measured to have an axial ratio @xmath18 :    @xmath29 \\label{eqn : a7}\\ ] ]    in our case , we estimate the measurement errors by fitting a straight line to the distribution of errors in the axial ratio @xmath18 as reported by the isophote fitting package .",
    "this gives :    @xmath30    and projection kernel hence becomes ,    @xmath31    the algorithm now involves using @xmath32 instead of @xmath22 in equations  [ eqn : a5 ] and [ eqn : a6 ] , for which the range of integration now becomes 0 to 1 , since now @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "one would expect that in successive iterations , the approximation @xmath35 to the observed distribution @xmath17   improve , and this can be used to decide when to terminate the algorithm .",
    "two different initial guesses for @xmath12  ( @xmath36 ) were tried , the first was peaked around @xmath37 , the second was constant for all @xmath13 .",
    "these two initial guesses thus cover two extremes of possible @xmath12 . for both initial guesses",
    ", @xmath12   quickly converges to the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] . to determine the indicative errors in the determination of @xmath12  , the 80% confidence limit histograms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind ] were fit with polynomials and lucy deconvolution was applied to these polynomials .",
    "the resulting intrinsic distribution functions are also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : psi ] , and the shaded area hence represents the @xmath38 80% confidence interval for @xmath12 .",
    "the final @xmath35 ( i.e. the final approximation to the observed distribution function ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind ] , and as it can be seen , it fits with the observed distribution within the error bars . the @xmath12   shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] has @xmath39 , standard deviation @xmath40 , and skewness ,  @xmath41 .",
    "[ eqn : i1 ] ( and hence results obtained from inverting it also ) applies only for a sample of randomly oriented oblate spheroids .",
    "the basic assumption hence is that the galaxy sample we are working with has an unbiased distribution of inclination angles .",
    "the selection criteria for the figgs sample ( from which the current sample is drawn ) includes a requirement that the optical major axis of the galaxy be @xmath9 .",
    "dwarf galaxies are generally dust poor ( for eg .",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence to a good approximation have optically thin discs .",
    "highly inclined galaxies will hence be over represented in a diameter limited sample , i.e. our sample is biased towards edge on discs .",
    "this means that the true mean intrinsic axial ratio would be even larger than what we have estimated above .",
    "it is worth noting that as the intrinsic axial ratio gets closer to 1.0 , the magnitude of this bias decreases , and hence the bias in our estimate should not be large .    the mean intrinsic axial ratio that we obtain , viz .",
    "@xmath42 is substantially larger than the value of @xmath43 usually adopted for the _ stellar _ discs of large spiral galaxies .",
    "the value from our sample is more than twice as large as older measurements of @xmath44 in stellar discs of magellanic irregular galaxies by @xcite ( ranging from 0.20 to 0.24 ) .",
    "consistent with this , our sample contains no very flat galaxies .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : bind ] there are no galaxies with apparent axial ratio @xmath45 in the sample .",
    "further , if we look at the distribution of the observed axial ratio of different classes of galaxies in the automated photographic measuring ( apm ) survey as in @xcite , then our histogram resembles those for ellipticals and s0s more closely than that for spirals .",
    "this is another qualitative indication that the underlying intrinsic distribution of axial ratios has a higher mean than is typical for spirals .",
    "interestingly , the value of @xmath44 we obtain matches well with what @xcite derived for the _ stellar _ discs in dwarfs .",
    "the thickness of the _ gas _ discs of dwarf galaxies is contrary to what one might have naively expected for a gas disc , since , in general , collisions between gas clouds should cause them to quickly settle into a thin disc .",
    "however , this large axial ratio is probably consistent with the large gas dispersion in comparison to the rotational velocity observed in dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite did particle hydrodynamic simulations to show that dwarf galaxies with rotational velocities @xmath3840 km  s@xmath46  did not originate as thin discs but thick systems .",
    "this still leaves open the question of where the large velocity dispersion comes from .",
    "@xcite find good evidence for a scale free power spectrum of hi fluctuations in dwarf galaxies , consisent with what would be expected from a turbulent medium .",
    "interestingly , they also find that that the dwarfs must have relatively thick gas discs , similar to the conclusions reached here .",
    "assuming that the origin of the velocity dispersion is turbulent motions in the ism , the timescale for dissipation is given by @xmath47 ( * ? ? ?",
    "the total turbulent energy is @xmath48 . for our sample galaxies ,",
    "the typical hi mass is @xmath49  m@xmath50 , while the length scale @xmath51kpc .",
    "the rate of turbulent energy dissipation is hence @xmath52erg / yr . on the other hand , the star formation rate is @xmath53 m@xmath50/yr @xcite , for which the expected supernova rate for a salpeter imf is @xmath54/yr @xcite . assuming that each supernova explosion deposits @xmath55 ergs of energy into the ism , the energy input from star formation is @xmath56 ergs / yr , more than sufficient to balance the turbulent energy loss .",
    "thus , star formation driven turbulence in the ism is a plausible cause for the thick gas discs that we observe .",
    "we have assumed through out that the hi discs of dwarf galaxies can be approximated as oblate spheroids . on the other hand , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] we saw that the inversion based on the best fit polynomial to the observed histogram of axial ratios actually gives unphysical results , i.e. that the derived intrinsic axial ratio distribution @xmath12  becomes negative . @xcite found a similar pattern for the axial ratio distribution of spiral and s0 galaxies in the apm catalog , and hence relaxed the assumption that the discs are oblate spheroids .",
    "adequate fits to their data could be obtained assuming that the galaxies have a triaxial shape .",
    "similarly , @xcite from a study of large galaxies in the 2mass catalog concluded that spiral galaxies are mildly triaxial .",
    "the fact that the polynomial approximation gives unphysical results for our sample also suggests that triaxial models may provide a better fit . on the other hand ,",
    "the lucy deconvolution gives a physically plausible ( as indeed it is designed to ) intrinsic axial ratio distribution , that fits the observed data within the error bars .",
    "it is worth noting that distribution found by lucy deconvolution is in excellent agreement with that found by direct inversion of the polynomial fit for the entire range for which the latter is @xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , if we assume the gas discs to be prolate instead of oblate spheroids , lucy deconvolution produces an equally acceptable @xmath17   as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : prophi ] .",
    "the @xmath12   obtained from lucy deconvolution with a prolate spheroid assumption ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : propsi ] ) indicates that such gas discs should be more cylindrical than spherical .",
    "however , the observed kinematics of gas in these galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "shows that the gas has a significant rotational support . as discussed earlier , a gravitationally bound rotating disc of gas forms an oblate and not a prolate spheroid",
    "thus , although from the axial ratio data alone , one can not distinguish between a prolate and oblate shapes , in conjuction with the kinematical data , it is clear that the gas is distributed in the form of a thick disc .    in summary , we find that the _ gas _ discs of dwarf galaxies are relatively thick , in sharp contrast to the gas discs of spiral galaxies .",
    "this has implications both for the internal dynamics of the gas , as well as for studies of the mass distribution tully - fisher relation in faint dwarfs , in which it is generally assumed that the gas is in a thin disc .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt who have made the observations used in this paper possible .",
