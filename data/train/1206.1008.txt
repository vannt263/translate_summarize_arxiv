    "in this note we determine the automorphism group of drinfeld s half - spaces over a finite field . given a finite - dimensional vector space @xmath0 over a finite field @xmath1 , the drinfeld half - space @xmath2 is defined as the complement of all @xmath1-rational hyperplanes in the projective space @xmath3 ; it is an affine algebraic variety over @xmath1 .",
    "we show that every @xmath1-automorphism of @xmath4 is induced by a @xmath1-automorphism of @xmath3 .",
    "hence the automorphism group of @xmath2 is equal to @xmath5 .    more generally , for an arbitrary field extension @xmath6 of @xmath1",
    ", we prove that the natural injection of @xmath7 into @xmath8 is an isomorphism .",
    "our result answers a question of dat , orlik and rapoport @xcite which was motivated by the analogous statement for drinfeld half - spaces over a non - archimedean local field ( with non - trivial absolute value ) .",
    "drinfeld defined his @xmath9-adic upper half - spaces in @xcite .",
    "they are the founding examples of the theory of period domains @xcite .",
    "analogs of period domains over finite fields have been studied by rapoport in @xcite .",
    "they are open subvarieties of flag varieties characterized by a semi - stability condition .",
    "recently , they have been studied by rapoport , orlik and others , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a good introduction is given in the book @xcite .",
    "over local non - archimedean fields with non - trivial absolue value , drinfeld half - spaces are no longer algebraic varieties and must be defined in the context of analytic geometry . in this setting , it was shown by berkovich that every automorphism is induced by a projective linear transformation @xcite .",
    "this was generalized to products of drinfeld half - spaces by alon @xcite , who also pointed out and corrected a discrepancy in berkovich s proof .",
    "berkovich s strategy is based on the fact that in the case of a local non - archimedean ground field with non - trivial absolute value , the bruhat - tits building of the group @xmath5 is contained in @xmath2 as the subset of points satisfying a natural maximality condition .",
    "this implies that every automorphism of @xmath2 induces an automorphism of the bruhat - tits building , and with some further work ( see @xcite ) one can show the claim .",
    "one could in fact use a similar strategy in order to determine the automorphism group of @xmath2 over a finite field . indeed , if we endow the finite ground field with the trivial absolute value and look at the corresponding berkovich analytic space @xmath10 , by @xcite , the _ vectorial building _",
    "associated to the group @xmath5 is contained in @xmath11 .",
    "we believe that one can then follow berkovich s and alon s arguments to deduce that this automorphism comes from an element of @xmath7 .    however , in this note , we adopt a slightly different , and maybe more natural , viewpoint .",
    "thereby , we want to highlight that the true content of this theorem is about _ extension _ of automorphisms , and that it has in fact very little to do with buildings , see remark [ remark - complex ] .",
    "our approach is the following .",
    "we consider the space @xmath12 obtained by blowing up all @xmath1-rational linear subspaces of the projective space @xmath3 .",
    "irreducible components of the boundary divisor correspond bijectively to linear subspaces of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , a family of components has non - empty intersection if and only if the corresponding linear subspaces form a flag .",
    "we use berkovich analytic geometry to prove in proposition [ prop - analytic ] that every automorphism of @xmath2 preserves the set of discrete valuations on the function field induced by boundary components of @xmath12 . hence by proposition [ prop - valuations ] it extends to an automorphism of @xmath12 . by taking a closer look at the chow ring of @xmath12 in section 3 ,",
    "we deduce that this automorphism preserves the set of discrete valuations corresponding to hyperplanes , which allows us to conclude that it induces an automorphism of the projective space .",
    "we thank vladimir berkovich for aquainting us with the results in @xcite .",
    "we also thank carlo gasbarri for suggesting an alternative argument for the last step of our proof , and stphane lamy for an interesting discussion on birational geometry .",
