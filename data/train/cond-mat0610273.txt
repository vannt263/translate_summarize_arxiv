    "here we will give more details regarding the irrelavance of the perturbations that break the lorentz symmetry at our lorentz invariant ki ",

    "it is tempting to break the lorentz invariance by perturbing only one field , @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",
    "however @xmath144 and @xmath145 loose their own identity as @xmath20 becomes massless and they mix together .",
    "having this mixing in mind we consider the most general perturbation which is of the kinetic form for the @xmath144 and @xmath145 fields , and is consistent with the gauge symmetry @xmath329 the corrections to fermion propagators and gauge vortex is represented diagrammatically : @xmath330 where we have used the notation @xmath331    we evaluate the two propagators @xmath318 and @xmath319 in the presence of the perturbation given by eq .",

    "next we calculate @xmath319 which is given by    & =    ( 40,18 )     + & +    ( 40,18 )     + & +    ( 40,18 )     + & +    ( 40,18 )     + & + + & + + & +    ( 40,18 )     + & +    ( 40,18 )     + & + + & + + & + + & + .",

    "so the scaling of @xmath144 and @xmath145 has to be accompanied by an appropriate scaling of @xmath20 . but",
    "this - in general - will move us away from the critical point . for the above perturbation though , the scaling factor for @xmath20 is 1 : @xmath343 so the above perturbation remains _ exactly marginal _ to all orders in @xmath24 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the uniform shift @xmath344 is an eigenvector with a negative eigenvalue .",
    "why should this perturbation flow ?",
    "the absorbtion of the uniform perturbation in @xmath144 and @xmath145 has to be accompanied by scaling the @xmath20 field by @xmath345 this scaling of the @xmath20 field will move us away from the critical point .",
    "in this appendix we will find the algebraic decay exponent of @xmath285 at ki ",

    "we do this by obtaining the staggered spin @xmath328 scaling dimension .",
    "it suffices to find the scaling dimension of @xmath287 , since the decay exponent of @xmath285 and @xmath286 is the same .",

    "the 1st property is useful since @xmath138 passes through all the @xmath351 matrices and the final result for the propagatros @xmath352 and @xmath353 will have a simple matrix form @xmath354 .",
    "the second property causes any diagram , with matrix @xmath138 left in a loop , to vanish .",
