    "however it was recently shown that this approach has an ambiguity : the presence of a cutoff not only affects the bulk terms of the lagrangian density but also the boundary terms @xcite .",
    "hence a total time derivative added to the classical action will not remain a total time derivative in the presence of a cutoff .",
    "in general , it will lead to a modification of the equations of motion . in a recent paper",
    "we exploited the aforementioned modified commutation relation and the ambiguity associated with it to explain the origin of cosmic - scale primordial magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton , @xmath5  the field that drives inflation  produce both scalar and tensor perturbations , both of which contribute to the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation . for any inflationary model",

    "it is therefore important to know @xmath6 in as much detail as possible in order to extract cosmological parameters with more precision .",
    "the effect of transplanckian physics on the tensor / scalar ratio was addressed for the first time in @xcite , where the authors discovered that the ratio will be influenced by the short distance physics , if tranplanckian physics does not lead to the same vacuum for scalar and tensor fluctuations . in this article , following the discovery of @xcite , we explore how the non - minimal choices of the boundary term for tensor and scalar fluctuations affect the tensor / scalar ratio .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows : first , we present the equations that scalar and tensor fluctuations satisfy in the presence of a uv cutoff @xcite , categorizing various cases for which the ratio can change . following ref .",
    "we then solve these equations for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically in a near de - sitter background .",
    "we compute how the scalar power spectrum varies as a function of @xmath8 . in the fourth section",
    "we ultimately find the ratio of tensor to scalar fluctuations .",

    "the difference in the above equations of motion is attributed to the non - triviality of the manner in which minimal length affects the boundary terms . the scalar fluctuation amplitude is then defined as @xcite @xmath32    similarly , for tensor perturbations , among an infinite number of actions that are equivalent in the absence of minimal length we _ choose _ amjad1 to start from @xmath33and @xmath34that again differ from each other by a boundary term . as we will see ,",

    "in general we have four possibilities :    i , ii : :    if we choose either @xmath52 or    @xmath53 as the actions describing scalar and    tensor fluctuations , the scalar modes @xmath54 , and    tensor modes @xmath55 , satisfy differential equations that are as similar as possible .",
    "in particular this implies that in the special cases of near - de - sitter    and power - law inflation where    @xmath56 ( see @xcite )    and @xmath57 ( see appendix ) , the    equations governing both scalar and tensor perturbations are    identical . since metric and inflaton perturbations",
    "can not be fully    distinguished in a gauge invariant manner , scalar and tensor modes    should also obey the same initial conditions , yielding    @xmath58 .",
    "the distinction    between cases i and ii becomes apparent when the inflating background    deviates from the power - law and near - de - sitter backgrounds .",
    "iii , iv : :    the other extreme is to select either of the pairs @xmath59 or @xmath60    to describe the situation . in these cases the modes    @xmath54 and @xmath39 , satisfy    differential equations of differing form even in near - de - sitter and    power - law backgrounds .",
    "in particular the tensor amplitude is not just    @xmath61 times the scalar amplitude in power - law backgrounds . in    the next section we present a complete analysis of the scalar and    tensor spectra in near - de - sitter space .",
    "we will investigate how the    ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations varies as a function of    @xmath62 , the ratio of minimal length to hubble length    during inflation .",
    "curvature fluctuations arise because the value of the inflaton field is coupled to the energy density of the vacuum energy driving inflation , i.e. fluctuations in the inflaton field result in fluctuations in the expansion rate at linear order in perturbation theory .",
    "this coupling is what creates fluctuations in the intrinsic curvature scalar , which are then manifest as density fluctuations . since in de sitter space fluctuations in the inflaton field , @xmath50 , are not coupled to fluctuations in the energy density , the amplitude of density fluctuations is zero . a naive exploitation of the formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite implies that the expression for density fluctuations is singular for de sitter space .",
    "the reason that the expression is singular is not because the density fluctuation amplitude is singular , but because the foliation of space - time implicit in the choice of gauge becomes singular .",
    "nevertheless , we can proceed in this manner by assuming that @xmath63 is close to zero , i.e. that the background is arbitrarily close to the de sitter limit .",
    "note that we are taking @xmath4 , the hubble parameter , to be very small , since it is known from cobe that @xmath64 .",
    "we begin with an analysis of the scalar power spectrum , tracking the normalized modes which are inside the horizon until they are far outside the horizon , where their amplitude determines the perturbation spectrum . to this end , we will solve the mode equation ( [ scr1 ] ) numerically .",
    "as in ref.@xcite , we describe the initial evolution by an approximate analytic solution , which we then evolve numerically to late times .    in this section and in what follows ,",
    "we first analyze the action @xmath65 and @xmath35 for scalar and tensor perturbations respectively . in de sitter space @xmath66 and @xmath67 . a mode with a fixed comoving wave number",
    "@xmath37 corresponds over time to increasing proper wave lengths .",
    "each mode s proper wave length corresponds to the planck length at some time @xmath68 that depends on @xmath37 and this is when the evolution of that mode begins .",
    "this time is when @xmath69 and @xmath70 . at this initial time equation ( [ scr1 ] ) has an irregular singular point .",
    "since de sitter space is time - translation invariant , the equation can be written in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath71 , in terms of which all the modes evolve jointly : @xmath72where @xmath73and in de sitter space @xmath74 . here",
    "we define @xmath75which is the ratio of the minimal length scale and the hubble length scale during inflation .",
    "the function @xmath76 is the lambert w - function , defined by the relation @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 65 ] ) has a singular point at @xmath78 .",
    "the singular point at @xmath79 is an irregular singular point because the coefficients of @xmath80 and @xmath54 are not analytic in @xmath81 @xmath82where @xmath83proceeding along the lines given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we solve for the leading behavior of @xmath54 by extracting the most singular terms of the equation of motion@xmath84where in the overdot now denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath85 . ignoring the @xmath86 term ,",
    "this equation is similar to the high frequency limit of the mode equation : @xmath87whose solution is approximated by the wkb form @xmath88if the adiabatic condition @xmath89 is satisfied .",
    "this choice of vacuum , which is called bunch - davies vacuum , reduces to the minkowskian vacuum for wavelengths smaller than the hubble scale .",
    "inspired by this similarity , one can suggest a bunch - davies - like vacuum of the form : @xmath90with @xmath91this vacuum does not satisfy the adiabaticity conditions in the vicinity of its creation time , @xmath92 . to be specific : @xmath93for @xmath94 the adiabatic condition is violated .",
    "it means that each mode is born in an excited state . in the model of transplanckian physics",
    "proposed in ref.@xcite , each mode undergoes three phases in its evolution . in the first phase ,",
    "the wavelength of the given mode is much smaller than the planck length : @xmath95 .",
    "each mode is born into the vacuum state that minimizes the hamiltonian and satisfies the adiabaticity condition . in the second phase ,",
    "the wavelength of the mode is larger than the planck length but still smaller than the hubble radius , @xmath96 . in the third phase the mode is outside the hubble radius : @xmath97 . in our version of this scenario ,",
    "the first phase is removed and replaced by an excited initial state which violates the adiabaticity conditions .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ 69 ] ) is solved exactly by @xmath98where @xmath99and where the coefficients @xmath100 are constrained through the wronskian condition : @xmath101 that reduces to @xmath102this equation will lead to a one parameter family of solutions .",

    "<S> we investigate here the implications for the tensor / scalar ratio of the recent discovery ( noted in astro - ph/0410139 ) that the introduction of a minimal length cutoff in the structure of spacetime does not leave boundary terms invariant . </S>",
    "<S> such a cutoff introduces an ambiguity in the choice of action for tensor and scalar perturbations , which in turn can affect this ratio . </S>",
