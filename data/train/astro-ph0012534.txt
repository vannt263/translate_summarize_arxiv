    "the effect of radiative momentum deposition on astrophysical outflows around compact objects were studied using early disc models by many workers ( e.g. vincent icke  @xcite and abramowicz and piran  @xcite ) .",
    "chattopadhyay and chakrabarti  @xcite , revisited the problem using the radiation from advective discs  @xcite .",
    "the outflow was found to be accelerated appreciably , pushing bound matters to infinity .",
    "compact objects do not have atmospheres like stars do , therefore the outflows or jets have to be generated from the inflowing matter itself .",
    "as accreting matter comes closer to the compact object , it is slowed down by the centrifugal force and may cause shock  @xcite , forcing the flow to jump discontinuously from supersonic to subsonic state .",
    "this hot , slowed down region puffs up in the form of a torus , known as the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( hereafter , cenbol ) .",
    "chakrabarti and titarchuk  @xcite pointed out that radiation from this region may dictate whether a black hole is in a soft state or in a hard state .",
    "similarly , chakrabarti and co - workers  @xcite pointed out that the same region also causes formation of outflow . in this region ,",
    "the subsonic outflowing matter is continuously bombarded by hot photons and hence apart from usual thermal acceleration , radiative acceleration should be important too .",
    "thus the toroidal region or the cenbol of accretion disc not only emits high energy radiation , but its typical shape helps the radiation to be focussed on the axis of symmetry .",
    "it is of no surprise that we find an impressive degree of acceleration at this region . our present exact computation by radiative momentum deposition ( ramod )",
    "also vindicates earlier investigation  @xcite , that momentum deposition force can also drive bound matters as outflows .",
    "solution of two - temperature equations inside a centrifugal barrier supported shock located at around @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is presented in chakrabarti and titarchuk  @xcite .",
    "the inner surface of the cenbol can be approximated by a cone , which we do and compute ramod along the axis of symmetry .",

    "we choose cylindrical ( r,@xmath9,z ) coordinates , where the compact object is at the origin @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the entire disc / outflow system is symmetrical about the axis of rotation of the disc , therefore ramod has only two components ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "we define a @xmath12 plane @xmath13 the flux of radiation at field point @xmath14i on @xmath13 , from differential area @xmath15 around source point @xmath16 is given by : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the frequency averaged radiation intensity on the surface and @xmath19 is the solid angle subtended by the differential area @xmath15 at @xmath3 and is equal to @xmath20",

    "we rewrite the expression of the density using the definition of sound speed , @xmath41 in a radiation dominated flow , @xmath42 i.e , @xmath43 which provides a upper limit of density .",
    "combining expressions ( 3b ) and ( 4 ) , we get ; @xmath44^{1/7}}. \\eqno{(5)}\\ ] ]    the condition for the optically thin flow ( @xmath45 ) in the thompson scattering regime for length scale @xmath46 , also provides the estimate of upper limit of density , @xmath47 from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , in order to have optically thin outflows , we get : @xmath48 or , @xmath49 where , @xmath50 is the mass outflow rate ( @xmath51 ) in the units of eddington rate for a @xmath52 black hole and @xmath53 is the black hole mass ( @xmath54 ) in units of @xmath52 . increasing @xmath31 increases disk luminosity and hence magnitude of ramod .",
    "however , chakrabarti  @xcite showed that higher @xmath31 results in higher outflow rate @xmath55 , which results in outflows with higher density @xmath56 and therefore higher @xmath57 . in case of optically thick outflows radiative",
    "acceleration is not efficient , as the intensity of radiation from the disc will be attenuated by a factor @xmath58 while passing through the flow . in our work the outflow considered",
