    "nonetheless , recent findings in @xcite indicate to hidden connections of the two cases through faddeev s modular duality  @xcite .    the spectral problem of operator has been addressed in @xcite as a part of a larger class of integrable systems related to supersymmetric gauge theories , and , more recently , in @xcite from the perspective of exact wkb approximation and in @xcite by using a matrix integral representation of the eigenfunctions .",
    "one can approach the same problem from the standpoint of quantum integrable systems by noting that both the bethe ansatz equations and the quantum method of separation of variables can be formulated in more general and universal framework of baxter s @xmath10 functional difference equations  @xcite which , in their turn , can be interpreted as ( one - dimensional ) quantum mechanical spectral problems . complemented with faddeev s modular duality idea , the second - named author has shown in @xcite that the modular @xmath10 equations of general form admit a particularly tractable approach to their solution in the so called `` strong coupling '' regime corresponding to a complexified parameter @xmath11 in the commutation relation  , namely @xmath12 with real @xmath130,\\pi/2[$ ] . in this case , operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 can not be neither self - adjoint nor unitary , but one can choose them to be normal and satisfying the relation @xmath14 implying that operator   stays normal , and thus its spectral problem still makes sense .    in this paper , motivated by topological string applications ,",
