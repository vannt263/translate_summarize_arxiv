    "thermodynamics of self - gravitating system is interesting subject but not clearly established yet . as @xcite mentioned , it is probably only fair to say that we do not have a systematic understanding of the self - gravitating system at a level similar to the kinetic theory of plasmas .",
    "although some results from statistical mechanics may not be direclty applied to systems with long - range forces like gravity @xcite , self - gravitating systems are correctly described by standard statistical mechanics provided that the thermodynamical limit is correctly defined @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to understand the thermodynamical behavior of self - gravitating system . among them , related with stellar dynamics , @xcite studied the entropy of self - gravitating , isothermal gaseous system surrounded by adiabatic rigid wall ( i.e. non - conducting wall ) and found that when the central concentration exceeds the critical value , the system can not have a local maximum value of entropy and leads to runaway instability .",
    "this is called antonov s problem suggesting core collapse of stellar system .",
    "@xcite extended antonov s problem to various boundary conditions and named the gravothermal catastrophe for this instability , which has been confirmed by many analytical and numerical works @xcite .",
    "the stability of isothermal self - gravitating system was first rigorously investigated by @xcite , and later reconsidered by @xcite using the second variation of entropy .",
    "these analyses were done in the microcanonical ensemble where the energy of the system is conserved ( i.e. non - conducting wall ) .",
    "recently @xcite extended the work of padmanabhan to the canonical ensemble where the temperature of the system is fixed ( i.e. conducting wall ) , using the second variation of the free energy .",
    "since the canonical distribution can not be derived from the microcanonical distribution in the presence of long - range interactions @xcite , mean field theory has been used to study the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems . in this perspective ,",
    "self - gravitating isothermal system is stable only if the system is in a local maximum of an appropriate thermodynamical potential ( i.e. the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble and the free energy in the canonical ensemble ) as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "however @xcite found the ` dilute ' thermodynamic limit ( particle number @xmath1 and volume @xmath2 , keeping @xmath3 constant ) where energy , entropy , the free energy are extensive .",
    "their works justify the previous analyses and specify the range of validity .",
    "previous studies of thermodynamical description of self - gravitating system have mostly considered the systems enclosed by rigid wall to prevent particle evaporation , which can be justified if a quasi - stationary condition is satisfied ( i.e. particle evaporation rate is small ) .",
    "@xcite replaced this rigid wall by tidal energy prescription and investigated antonov s problem in alternative point of view , which naturally determines the size of the system in addition to confirming main features of the isothermal sphere model ( i.e. core collapse and negative heat capacity ) .",
    "here we propose another natural boundary condition : a potential well which keeps particles from evaporating .",
    "the completely isolated system is hard to find in astronomy and this type of boundary condition is often seen in different astronomical scale : for example , cluster galaxies embedded in dark matter potential well and dense stellar system in galactic nuclei surrounded by much larger bulge . however the system embedded in potential well and the effect of potential well to the evolution of central self - gravitating system have not been studied in thermodynamical point of view . therefore in this work , by introducing simple model to describe the self - gravitating system in potential well , we attempt to answer the following questions : what the role of potential well is , how the embedded system evolves dynamically and what the equilibrium configuration for this embedded self - gravitating system can be .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the previous works on the self - gravitating isothermal sphere surrounded by spherical rigid wall are briefly overviewed .",
    "we assign this separate section to describe the derivation of some formulae and provide interpretations of the previously known results because more detailed description of these previous works is necessary to describe our work which replaces the rigid wall by a potential well . then",
    "in section 3 , we consider the potential well as a new boundary and study the role of potential well . in section 4 ,",
    "we numerically simulate the dynamical evolution of self - gravitating system in potential well .",
    "the equilibrium models are presented in section 5 . in the last section ,",
    "the results are summarized , and implications and limitations of this study are discussed .",

    "this also supports the argument that the external potential behaves effectively like a heat bath .    in fig .",

    "thus core collapse would not occur .",
    "since the potential well confines the outer part of the embedded system and increases the velocity dispersion , the central region expands and outer boundary shrinks when it reaches the equilibrium .",
    "model2 whose equilibrium density profile is shown with blue solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , is the intermediate case and loosely bound by gravity as the total energy is less than , but close to 0.0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , core collapse does not occur until the simulation stops at @xmath149 , although it might occur after very long time .",
    "since the potential well of model2 is not as deep as that of model1 , the outer boundary is not declined as sharply as model1 .",
    "also the central region does not expand as much as model1 because the increase of velocity dispersion due to the heating by the external potential is not as significant as model1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we compare the equilibrium density profiles from analytic model ( dotted line ) and @xmath0-body model ( solid line ) , for model2 ( blue ) and model4 ( red ) .",
    "final quasi - equilibrium density profile from @xmath0-body simulation ( black solid lines among the density profile snapshots of model2 and model4 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] were compared with equilibrium density profiles of model2 and model4 in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "all density profiles are normalized to the central density , and radius is scaled as follows .",
    "we estimate the @xmath142 and the velocity dispersion assumed to be isothermal , from density and velocity dispersion profiles ( black lines ) in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , and calculate the corresponding core radius of isothermal sphere @xmath150 for model2 and model4 , where @xmath151 is the radial velocity dispersion estimated from @xmath0-body simulation",
    ". then we rescale radius of @xmath0-body density profile by multiplying initial half - mass radius ( i.e. recall that the radius in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] is scaled by initial half - mass radius ) , and multiply the corresponding core radius .",
    "now @xmath0-body density profile radius is the same @xmath10 as one in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "although the discrepancy between analytic and @xmath0-body models is seen at the center possibly due to the small number of particles in @xmath0-body simulation , analytic and @xmath0-body model show the consistent result .",
    "using simple models we studied the effect of surrounding potential well to the surrounded self - gravitating system , simulated the dynamical evolution of the system and proposed equilibrium models . in the following ,",
    "we summarize and discuss the result .",
    "we approximate plummer potential to harmonic potential near the center by taylor expansion and investigate its effect to the isothermal self - gravitating system at the center of the potential well . as the external potential becomes deeper compared with that of the embedded self - gravitating system , the external potential behaves like a conducting rigid wall which permits the heat exchange and conserves the temperature of self - gravitating system .",
    "if the potential depth ratio @xmath93 is smaller than 1.5 , there is a minimum dimensionless energy @xmath94 in @xmath100 plane , below which the system has no equilibrium condition .",
    "however if @xmath93 is greater than 1.5 , there is a maximum @xmath94 , beyond which the system can not be in equilibrium .",
    "as the potential depth ratio becomes large , the density contrast @xmath41 at @xmath152 becomes close to 32.1 , which is the value for isothermal sphere enclosed by conducting wall with dimensionless temperature @xmath35 .",
    "thermodynamical description of self - gravitating system is useful for understanding the global evolution of the system .",
    "recently similar works in section 2 are done using a general functional @xcite which gives the polytrope with index @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "isothermal sphere and plummer model correspond to the polytrope with @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively .",
    "however , the maximization of _ tsallis functional _ at fixed mass and energy is a condition of dynamical stability rather than thermodynamical stability @xcite . in this context",
    ", polytropic distribution is justified as a particular steady solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "furthermore , in this dynamical interpretation , _ tsallis functional _ is not an entropy .",
    "strictly speaking , the self - gravitating system does not have the thermodynamic limit where usually particle number @xmath1 and volume @xmath2 , keeping @xmath156 constant @xcite .",
    "however , de vega & snchez @xcite found the ` dilute ' thermodynamic limit ( particle number @xmath1 and volume @xmath2 , keeping @xmath3 constant ) where energy , entropy , the free energy are extensive .",
    "this study provides a justification of taking thermodynamical approach to describe the self - gravitating system , which is useful to understand important physics using much less expensive computational resource than numerical simulation .",
    "we generate self - gravitating stellar system and surround it using external plummer potential .",
    "nbody6 simulates the evolution of the system and shows the consistent results with the argument in section 3 .",
    "the potential well retards the relaxation process by heating the embedded stellar system and increasing its velocity dispersion .",
    "thus if the embedded system has a positive energy @xmath27 , it behaves like an ideal gas and does not experience the gravothermal catastrophe . on the other hand , the system with negative energy eventually experiences core collapse by gravothermal catastrophe , although core collapse time of the system is larger than that of isolated stellar system .",
    "it is because , as the kinetic energy of stars interacting with the potential increases , the system becomes loosely gravitationally bound and @xmath119 of the embedded system increases ( see eq .",
    "[ rlxtime ] ) .",
    "the evolution of lagrangian radii of our model shows that the deep external potential makes the embedded system gravitationally unbound and core collapse does not occur as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . from the energy exchange between the embedded system and surrounding potential well as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , it is suggested that the potential well heats the embedded system and increases its kinetic energy .",
    "therefore the total energy of embedded system can be positive if the potential well is deep enough .    from the time evolution of density and velocity dispersion profiles of the embedded system in the external potential",
    "well , it is very likely that the embedded system is in thermal equilibrium with the potential well . in deep potential",
    "well , we show that the velocity dispersion profile becomes isothermal due to the heating by the potential well .",
    "the inner part of density profile becomes less concentrate and the outer part becomes steeper than the isolated system . in the shallow potential well",
    ", we see that core collapse occurs , and the velocity dispersion profile is not isothermal and has a gradient .",
    "these simulations are based on simple model where the possible interaction between central system and surrounding potential well is not considered . in order to understand how the embedded system co - evolves with potential well , we need to implement the potential well using large number of stellar particle instead of fixed potential function",
    ". however , for the deep potential well , our simple approach with fixed potential would be a good approximation .",
    "based on the conclusion that if the potential well is a heat bath , the embedded self - gravitating system is in isothermal equilibrium with the potential well , we derived the equilibrium density profiles of self - gravitating system embedded in potential well by solving jeans equation and poisson equation .",
    "these equilibrium density profiles are similar to @xmath0-body simulation results .",
    "especially these equilibrium models are physically motivated by radial distribution profile of galaxies in cluster , which is often modelled by king profile @xcite .",
    "king model is a good fit for distribution of galaxies near the cluster core .",
    "however king model looses stars by tidal energy cut - off .",
    "this picture is unrealistic in the case of galaxies in cluster , which are embedded in the deep potential well of cluster dark matter halo .",
    "galaxies in cluster are bound and hard to escape from cluster potential well .",
    "our model can be more realistic description for galaxy clusters .",
    "while the king profile drops at the outer part due to tidal energy cut - off , our model profile drops because the potential well confines the embedded system and keeps stars from escaping out .",
