    "the mechanism driving the emergence of a quantum macroscopic coherent phase that is able to resist to the de - coherence effects of high temperature remains a major topic of research in condensed matter .",
    "the realization of this macroscopic quantum phase in doped cuprates close to the mott insulator regime has stimulated a large amount of investigations on the physics of strongly correlated metals .",
    "most of theoretical papers treated models of a homogeneous system made of a single electronic band ( or models of multiple hybridized bands reduced to a single effective band ) , with a large hubbard repulsion .",
    "there is growing agreement that the solution of the problem of high-@xmath1 superconductivity requires the correct description of the normal state where spin , charge , orbital and lattice degree of freedoms compete and the functional phase emerges in a complex system with two main components showing mesoscopic phase separation . here",
    "we consider a theoretical model of the mesoscopic phase separation in a two - band scenario of two strongly correlated electronic fluids . this simple model grabs the key physics of the anomalous normal phase in cuprates exhibiting the phase separation as a function of charge density and the energy splitting between the two bands .",
    "this allows the understanding of the different superconducting phases in different cuprate families , i.e. , the new 3d phase diagram where the critical temperature depends on the doping and pressure  @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this theoretical work is based on the results of recent experiments using angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( stm ) @xcite providing compelling experimental evidence for dual nature of charge carriers and the nanoscale phase separation of the two components in two different spatial domains in cuprate high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite .",
    "a clear case for the phase separation of the two types of charge carriers is overoxygenated la@xmath0cuo@xmath3 where the interstitial oxygen ions are mobile above 180 k and stimulate the phase separation of the two different kinds of dopant holes @xcite .",
    "currently , from the analysis of magnetic neutron scattering experiments , there is an agreement for the frustrated mesoscopic phase separation at doping larger than 1/8 in sr - doped la214 , y123 , and bi2212 between a first more delocalized component that does not show spin fluctuations and a second more localized electronic component , showing stripe - like spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "several reviews and books have been published on the two - component scenario and phase separation in cuprates @xcite . here",
    "we focus not on the well studied phase separation in the underdoped regime , near the mott phase , between a hole - poor antiferromagnetic phase and a metallic hole - rich phase but on the phase separation in the overdoped regime @xcite between a hole poor phase with doping close to 1/8 and a hole - rich phase with doping close to 1/4 .",
    "this phase - separation scenario has been described in refs .   for lasrcuo and overoxygenated la@xmath0cuo@xmath2 .",
    "it is based on the experimental fact that variation of the magnetic incommensurability due to spin stripes saturates at doping 1/8 see fig .",
    "15 of ref .  .",
    "the residual magnetic scattering at high doping suggests that one of the phases has stripe correlations similar to the @xmath4 phase , with the volume fraction of this phase decreasing with @xmath5 , as indicated in fig .",
    "17 of ref .  .",
    "the other phase is presumably uniformly doped .",
    "the picture , then , is that as one increases the doping beyond @xmath6 , it becomes unfavorable to accommodate the additional holes in stripes ; instead , patches of the uniformly - doped phase grow at the expense of the stripe phase . the maximum @xmath1 seems to occur in a mixed phase region dominated by the stripe phase .",
    "a similar scenario is now well accepted for understanding the physics of phase separation in manganites  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that even in the absence of any specific order parameter , the presence of two strongly correlated electron bands leads to the possibility of a phase - separated state @xcite .    in ref .",
    ", the evolution of phase separation was studied as a function of doping . however",
    ", a large amount of data clearly indicates that the phase separation regime is not only a function of doping but also of the anisotropic chemical pressure acting on the cuo@xmath0 layers , due to interlayer mismatch @xcite .",
    "the chemical pressure is a well established physical variable that controls the physical properties of perovskites and it is usually measured by the average ionic radius of the cations in the intercalated layers or the tolerance factor @xmath7 , in fact , the internal chemical pressure in perovskites can be defined as @xmath8 . in all perovkites and particularly in manganites , it is well established that the phase diagram of the electronic phases depends on the two variables , charge density and chemical pressure @xcite . since the early years of high-@xmath1 superconductivity research",
    "the mismatch chemical pressure has been considered as a key variable controlling the electronic properties of cuprates only on one family , la214 @xcite , however it was not possible to extend this idea to other families for the presence of a plurality of intercalated layers with cations having largely different coordination numbers .",
    "therefore , it was not possible to compare the average ionic size @xmath9 in the intercalated layers and to get the tolerance factor @xmath7 for all cuprate families .",
    "this problem was solved by obtaining the internal chemical pressure from the measure of the compressive microstrain @xmath10 in the cuo@xmath0 plane ( that has the same absolute value as the tensile microstrain in the intercalated layers ) where @xmath11 is the average cu - o distance and @xmath12  nm is the unrelaxed cu - o distance @xcite .",
    "therefore , the chemical pressure is proportional to microstrain , @xmath13 .    in this new 3d phase diagram ,",
    "the phase separation for the overdoped regime in overoxygenated la214 occurs in a family with high chemical pressure close to @xmath14 , while it becomes a frustrated phase separation in the lasrcuo , bi2212 , and y123 that are in the range of chemical pressure @xmath15 , while for cuprates with lower microstrain only very fast critical fluctuations could be present @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a model of a two - component system made of two different strongly correlated electron bands where the chemical pressure controls the energy splitting between the two bands .",
    "the phase separation in the overdoped regime can exist for specific values of the ratio between the bandwith of the two bands .",
    "the critical point for the transition from a frustrated phase separation to a non frustrated phase separation can be obtained by tuning the long range @xmath16 coulomb repulsion that frustrates the phase separation as going from sr doped to oxygen doped la124 .",
    "the existence of the two types of the strongly correlated charge carriers in cuprates can be described in terms of the two - band hubbard model .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system can be written as @xcite @xmath17 here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons corresponding to bands @xmath20 at site @xmath21 with spin projection @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",

    "the effect of the microstrain on the relative band positions can be significant since the value @xmath28 arises due to splitting of the originally degenerate levels . in the same time , small strains give rise only to a small corrections to the bandwidth .",

    "<S> in the framework of a two - band model , we study the phase separation regime of different kinds of strongly correlated charge carriers as a function of the energy splitting between the two sets of bands . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow ( wide ) band simulates the more localized ( more delocalized ) type of charge carriers . by assuming that the internal chemical pressure on the cuo@xmath0 layer due to interlayer mismatch controls the energy splitting between the two sets of states , the theoretical predictions are able to reproduce the regime of phase separation at doping higher than 1/8 in the experimental pressure - doping-@xmath1 phase diagram of cuprates at large microstrain as it appears in overoxygenated la@xmath0cuo@xmath2 . </S>"
