    "the electric resistivity of magnetic metals is due to several scattering mechanisms , including scattering on impurities , lattice vibrations , and spin fluctuations.@xcite while the impurity and phonon scattering are well understood both on the general level @xcite and quantitatively , @xcite spin - disorder scattering has not been studied based on the first - principles electronic structure theory until recently .",
    "@xcite understanding of this scattering mechanism is important , because it provides quantitative information about the character of thermal spin fluctuations in metals.@xcite    the interpretation of resistivity measurements in magnetic metals usually assumes that matthiessen s rule holds .",
    "@xcite under this assumption it makes sense to talk about the individual spin - disorder contribution to the resistivity , which does not depend on the intensity of other scattering mechanisms .",
    "if the local moments are temperature - independent , this contribution saturates in the paramagnetic state , which allows one to fit and subtract out the residual and phonon contributions . the remaining part obtained in this way",
    "will be referred to below as the apparent spin - disorder resitivity ( sdr ) .    to calculate the sdr from first - principles ,",
    "the most general approach is to construct supercells representing an ensemble of spin disorder configurations , average the landauer - bttiker conductance over this ensemble , and extract the resistivity from the scaling of the result with the dimensions of the supercell .",
    "this approach has been applied to transition metals fe and ni@xcite and to the gd - tm series of heavy rare - earth metals.@xcite a simpler procedure is to calculate the resistivity using the kubo - greenwood formula applied to the disordered local moment ( dlm ) state , @xcite which represents the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) applied to the paramagnetic state .",
    "the application of this procedure is similar to the calculation of the residual resistivity of substitutional alloys.@xcite the results for transition metal ferromagnets @xcite and heavy rare - earth metals @xcite were found to agree very well with the supercell calculations .    for transition metals and alloys ,",
    "calculated sdr is generally in good agreement with experimental data.@xcite in contrast , for heavy rare - earth metals in the gd - tm series the calculated sdr is systematically underestimated.@xcite for heavier elements in the series the agreement with experiment is significantly improved by applying the @xmath0 quantum correction , which corresponds to the limit of weak spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the justification for this choice is lacking , absent a consistent description of the conduction electron scattering on localized spins in the regime when hybridization is comparable to spin - orbit multiplet splittings .",
    "this uncertainty complicates the comparison of the calculated sdr with experimental data for the heavier elements .",
    "however , for lighter elements with large spin moments , particularly gd , a large underestimation of the resistivity by more than a factor of 2 can not be explained by any kind of quantum correction , and its origin should therefore be sought in the details of the electronic structure and scattering . in particular , the validity of matthiessen s rule in the presence of strong spin and phonon disorder should be brought into question .    in this paper",
    "we extend our supercell approach @xcite to evaluate the resistivity in the presence of both spin and phonon disorder .",
    "we apply this method to fe and gd and find significant deviations from matthiessen s rule with increasing disorder , which are particularly strong for gd and indicate a hidden resistivity saturation effect . as a result ,",
    "the sdr calculated at zero lattice displacements becomes much smaller than the value obtained by extrapoling the high - temperature data , which provides an explanation for the apparent underestimation of sdr in previous calculations neglecting the phonons .",

    "atomic displacements can be included explicitly in supercell calculations .",
    "electron scattering on such frozen thermal lattice disorder is a good representation of phonon scattering at temperatures that are not too low compared to the debye temperature . with an uncorrelated gaussian distribution for the lattice displacements ,",
    "this approach was recently employed to study gilbert damping.@xcite the lattice displacements can also be determined more realistically from the born model or _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics simulations.@xcite it is also possible to include uncorrelated atomic displacements within the cpa .",

    "spin disorder is introduced by randomly assigning the direction of the local magnetic moment vector on each atom in the supercell .",
    "@xcite the effects of spin and lattice disorder can thus be studied on the same footing .",

    "the brillouin zone integration was performed using meshes that ranged from @xmath16 for @xmath1-fe with vector spin disorder to @xmath17 for @xmath1-fe with collinear ( ising ) spin disorder .",

    ", we calculated the @xmath11 axis resistivity of gd with artificial anderson disorder introduced instead of the lattice displacements .",
    "this was done by adding random shifts to the atomic potentials of different sites ( on - site band - center parameters @xmath20 and linearization energies @xmath21 in lmto ) , which were distributed uniformly in the range of @xmath22 .",
    "we performed two sets of calculations for this system , one with random vector spin disorder and atomic potentials from the ferromagnetic state ( averaging over 15 disorder configurations ) , and another with zero magnetic moments on all sites ( 30 configurations ) .",
    "the densities of states ( dos ) of gd with spin and lattice disorder were calculated using a 64-atom supercell ( 4 hexagonal monolayers with 16 atoms per monolayer ) .",
    "the atomic potentials were taken from the ferromagnetic state ( local moment @xmath23 ) .",
    "seven random vector spin disorder configurations were generated for averaging , and random lattice displacements of different amplitudes were introduced as described above .",
    "the partial spin - dependent density of states ( dos ) was then calculated for each atom in the local reference frame in which the @xmath24 axis is parallel to the direction of the local magnetic moment .",
    "this partial dos was then averaged over all atoms and disorder configurations .",
    "the bloch spectral functions of gd with spin and anderson disorder were calculated using the standard technique within the cpa .",
    "@xcite here , instead of a uniform distribution of the disorder potential , we assumed that the local potential shift randomly takes two values , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the two spin orientations combined with two values of the potential shift are then formally treated in cpa as a four - component random alloy .",
    "it has become common practice to determine the sdr by extrapolating the high - temperature resistivity data back to zero temperature .",
    "this procedure relies on the assumption that spin - disorder and phonon scattering processes are independent , which is a good approximation as long as the electronic states retain their quasiparticle character and their band structure is weakly affected by disorder . if these conditions are satisfied , a linear temperature dependence of resistivity is expected at temperatures above the debye temperature .",

    "the resistivity curves for @xmath1-fe and @xmath2-fe are very similar .",

    "the @xmath33 curves for both fe and gd ( figs .",

    "as @xmath30 is increased , the slope decreases and eventually becomes almost constant .",
    "below we will show that this feature is due to the breakdown of certain parts of the fermi surface and is insensitive to the type of disorder .",
    "we interpret this as a resistivity saturation effect which takes place when the resistivity becomes of the order 100 @xmath34 cm .",
    "clearly , matthiessen s rule breaks down in the nonlinear regime , and the separation of the total resistivity into phonon and spin - disorder contributions becomes impossible . to facilitate further discussion",

    "the definition of apparent sdr is only possible as long as the slope of @xmath33 becomes approximately constant in the strong disorder regime , as it does in our calculations for fe and gd .",
    "the usual method of extracting the sdr from high - temperature experimental data yields the apparent sdr .",
    "[ pic - results]b and [ pic - results]c show that the bare and apparent sdr are quite different in fe and particularly in gd . for @xmath1-fe ( @xmath2-fe ) ,",

    "the apparent sdr for fe and gd ( intercepts in table [ table - figuredata ] ) are somewhat larger than the experimental estimated of sdr obtained by extrapolating the high - temperature data ( 80 , 108 , and 96 @xmath36 @xmath37 cm for fe , gd with in - plane and @xmath11 axis transport , respectively ) . in the case of fe",
    "a portion of this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the crossover to the resistivity saturation regime is incomplete , which is strongly suggested by fig .",
    "[ pic - exptdata]a .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of @xmath8 orbitals in the basis set led to a reduction of the bare sdr @xcite by about 15% and could similarly lower the apparent sdr .    for gd",
    "the in - plane apparent sdr is 28% greater compared to the experimental extrapolated sdr , and the @xmath11-axis resistivity is 11% greater .",
    "taking into account the experimental uncertainties , this agreement can be judged as good .",
    "as noted earlier , @xcite the magnitude of the local moment has a significant effect on the bare sdr .",
    "in particular , with the local moment taken from a self - consistent cpa - dlm calculation , the bare in - plane sdr for gd is almost 30% lower compared to the case when the local moment is taken from the ferromagnetic calculation .",
    "we therefore performed a similar comparison for the resistivity in the presence of lattice vibrations ; the corresponding curve is shown by open circles in fig .",
    "[ pic - results]c .",
    "we observe that the difference between the resistivities calculated for @xmath38 and 7.45 @xmath39 decreases as @xmath30 is increased and eventually almost disappears ( see also the inset ) .",
    "the apparent sdr is only reduced by 6% in the latter case , which is likely within the uncertainty of the extrapolation .",
    "this feature is consistent with the resistivity saturation phenomenon .    to gain further insight in the role of different scattering mechanisms , we repeated the calculations of the in - plane resistivity of gd with a fictitious anderson disorder introduced in lieu of the random lattice displacements . for comparison we considered the spin - disordered system with @xmath23 and its non - magnetic counterpart with unpolarized @xmath8 cores .",

    "the issue of quantum corrections is of particular interest .",

    "legvold @xcite claimed that the @xmath60 scaling is accidental and introduced an empirical correction based on the slope @xmath61 of the resistivity above the magnetic transition temperature , assuming that the large factor - of - two variation of this slope through the gd - tm series is due to the changes in the fermi surface area .",
    "however , the calculated variation in the relevant fermi - velocity integral across the series is only about 20% , @xcite which is too small compared with the observed variation of @xmath61 .",
    "the results presented above along with the high - temperature resistivity measurements @xcite show that the variation in @xmath61 is largely due to the resistivity saturation trend and not to the changes in the fermi surface .",
    "as regards the absolute values of the resistivity , we found that the comparison with experimental data for lighter elements in the gd - tm series requires that lattice disorder is included in the calculation along with spin disorder .",
    "at least for gd the resistivity calculated in this way is in reasonable agreement with experiment . for heavier elements with lower transition temperatures ,",
    "saturation effects remain insignificant in the region used for the fitting , and the sdr extracted from experiment can therefore be directly compared with the calculated bare sdr .",
    "for these heavier elements the agreement with experiment appears to be significantly improved by assuming @xmath60 scaling.@xcite this kind of scaling occurs if the spin and orbital moments are not strongly coupled to each other , which is surprising for heavy rare - earth elements . while understanding the origin of this behavior is beyond the scope of this paper , we suggest that the finite width of the @xmath8 band , if comparable to the spin - orbit multiplet splitting , can destroy the strong correlation between the spin and orbital moment .",

    "<S> according to earlier first - principles calculations , the spin - disorder contribution to the resistivity of rare - earth metals in the paramagnetic state is strongly underestimated if matthiessen s rule is assumed to hold . to understand this discrepancy , </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity of paramagnetic fe and gd is evaluated by taking into account both spin and phonon disorder . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are performed using the supercell approach within the linear muffin - tin orbital method . </S>",
    "<S> phonon disorder is modeled by introducing random displacements of the atomic nuclei , and the results are compared with the case of fictitious anderson disorder . in both cases the resistivity shows a nonlinear dependence on the square of the disorder potential , which is interpreted as a resistivity saturation effect . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is much stronger in gd than in fe . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linearity makes the phonon and spin - disorder contributions to the resistivity non - additive , and the standard procedure of extracting the spin - disorder resistivity by extrapolation from high temperatures becomes ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> an `` apparent '' spin - disorder resistivity obtained through such extrapolation is in much better agreement with experiment compared to the results obtained by considering only spin disorder . by analyzing the spectral function of the paramagnetic gd in the presence of anderson disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity saturation is explained by the collapse of a large area of the fermi surface due to the disorder - induced mixing between the electronic and hole sheets . </S>"
