    "<S> recently the concept of critical point symmetry has been proposed by iachello@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these kind of symmetries apply when a quantal system undergoes transitions between traditional dynamical symmetries . in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the particular case of the bohr hamiltonian@xcite in nuclear physics was worked out . in this case , in the situation </S>",
    "<S> in which the potential energy surface in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane is @xmath2-independent and the dependence in the @xmath1 degree of freedom can be modeled by an infinite square well , the so called e(5 ) symmetry appears . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is expected to be realized in actual nuclei when they undergo a transition from spherical to @xmath2-unstable deformed shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the e(5 ) symmetry is obtained within the formalism based on the bohr hamiltonian , but it has also been used in connection with the interacting boson model ( ibm)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this is not the form it was originally proposed@xcite , it has been in fact argued that moving from the spherical to the @xmath2-unstable deformed case within the ibm one should reobtain , at the critical point in the transition , the predictions of the e(5 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this correspondence is supposed to be valid in the limit of large number n of bosons , but the calculations with the ibm should provide predictions for finite n as stated in ref.@xcite . in this letter , on one hand we calculate exactly the large n limit of the ibm at the critical point in the transition from u(5 ) ( spherical case ) to o(6 ) ( deformed @xmath2-unstable case ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we solve the bohr differential equation for a @xmath0 potential . </S>",
    "<S> both calculations lead to the same results and are not close to those obtained by solving the bohr equation for an infinite square well ( e(5 ) symmetry ) . </S>",

[ hqq ] ) at the critical point for different number of bosons . these codes allow to manage a small number of bosons , typically 20 . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4 ] it is clear that the finite n effects are important and depend on the precise form of the hamiltonian used . however , it is difficult to conclude whether e(5 ) or @xmath0 is the large n limit of the corresponding ibm hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to perform calculations with larger values of n. fortunately , dukelsky et al.@xcite have recovered an exactly solvable model for pairing proposed by richardson in the 60s@xcite . following ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> we have solved the richardson s equations and obtained the exact eigenvalues for the hamiltonians ( [ hpp ] ) and ( [ hqq ] ) up to @xmath55 , so approaching the large n limit of the corresponding ibm hamiltonians . details of this method will be given in a longer publication . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] we present the results of these calculations for energy ratios up to @xmath55 and b(e2 ) ratios up to @xmath56 together with the corresponding values for the e(5 ) symmetry and the @xmath0 potential . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> it clearly emerges that the large n limit for the studied ibm hamiltonians corresponds to the @xmath0 potential . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ hpp ] ) and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hqq ] ) converge to the same results in the large n limit , although the corresponding corrections for finite n are quite different ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the large n limit of the ibm hamiltonian at the critical point in the transition from u(5 ) ( spherical ) to o(6 ) ( deformed @xmath2-unstable ) is represented in the geometrical model by a @xmath0 potential . </S>",
    "<S> the results are similar but not close to those of an infinite square well as in the e(5 ) critical point symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the ibm energy surface followed by an ibm calculation , as presented in ref.@xcite , can provide the appropriate finite n corrections and thus lead to the identification of nuclei at the critical points . in that work a systematic study of the properties of the ru isotopes allowed to select the appropriate form of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> once it is fixed the construction of the energy surfaces identify the critical nucleus ( @xmath57ru in that case ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding ibm calculation for the critical nucleus then provides the correct finite n corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is a fundamental step if we wish to robustly identify the spectroscopic properties that signal the presence of criticality in the atomic nucleus . </S>"
