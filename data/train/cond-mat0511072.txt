    "the behavior of such heteropolymers in the presence of an interface separating two selective solvents , one favorable to the hydrophobic components and the other to the hydrophilic components , is less obvious , and has been much studied recently @xcite . in the initial work of ref .",
    "@xcite , a model was proposed and studied via imry - ma arguments , an analysis of the replica hamiltonian and numerics : it was found that a chain with a symmetric distribution of hydrophobic / hydrophilic components is always localized around the interface at any temperature ( in the thermodynamic limit ) , whereas a chain with a dissymmetric distribution of hydrophobic / hydrophilic components presents a phase transition separating a localized phase at low temperature from a delocalized phase into the most favorable solvent at high temperature .",

    ", the fluctuations of these pseudo - critical temperatures obey the scaling of a central limit theorem as in the harris argument : @xmath17 this behavior was first believed to hold in general @xcite , but was later shown to be wrong in the case of random fixed points : in @xcite , it was argued that at a random critical point , one has instead @xmath18 i.e. the scaling is the same as the @xmath2-dependent shift of the averaged pseudo - critical temperature ( [ meantc ] ) .",
