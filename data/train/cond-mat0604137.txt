    "the asymmetric cooper pairing between different species of fermions with mismatched fermi surfaces , which was discussed many years ago , promoted new interest in both theoretic and experimental studies in recent years .",
    "the mismatched fermi surfaces can be realized , for instance , in a superconductor with zeeman splitting induced by an external field@xcite , an atomic fermion gas composed of two species of atoms with different densities and/or masses@xcite , an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter with proton - neutron pairing@xcite , and color superconducting quark matter with charge neutrality@xcite . among the mechanisms which can produce asymmetry between the pairing fermions ,",
    "the mass difference is a very robust one .",
    "the cooper pairing between fermions with unequal masses was firstly investigated by v.liu and f.wilczek@xcite .",
    "they considered a fermion gas composed of light and heavy fermions with attractive interaction .",
    "a homogeneous and isotropic pairing state which is similar to the sarma state@xcite was proposed to be the ground state of such systems .",
    "such an exotic pairing state is now called breached pairing ( bp ) state or interior gap state . in the bp state there",
    "exists gapless fermion excitations , and the superfluid fermi gas and the normal fermi gas coexist in the momentum space .",
    "it was found many years ago that the sarma state suffers a thermodynamic instability@xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that this sarma instability can be cured in some physical conditions , such as a long - range interaction when charge neutrality is required@xcite , a proper finite range interaction between the two species of fermions with large mass difference@xcite , and a superfluid fermi gas with density imbalance in strong coupling region@xcite .",
    "while the sarma instability can be cured , it was soon found that the superfluid density of the bp state is negative@xcite and the free energy of the mixed phase is also lower than that of the bp state@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in the study of color superconductivity , it was found that the gapless color superconductors possess paramagnetic response to external color magnetic fields , i.e. , the meissner masses of some gluons are negative@xcite .",
    "all these phenomena indicate that the homogeneous and isotropic bp state is unstable and some spatially inhomogeneous and isotropic states are energetically favored@xcite .",
    "the superfluid density is a fundamental quantity in superconductivity .",
    "it is well known that the superfluid density is proportional to the meissner mass squared and often measured via the london penetration depth in experiments . due to this relation ,",
    "one often regards the negative superfluid density observed in a bp state and the negative meissner mass squared observed in a gapless color superconductor as the same instability .    however , almost all these studies focus on systems where the masses of the pairing fermions are equal . in the study of superfluid stability of interior gap states , s.t.wu and",
    "s.yip derived a formula of the superfluid density for non - relativistic asymmetric fermion superfluids with the concept of quasiparticles@xcite . in the equal mass case ,",
    "their formula is consistent with the result calculated from the linear response theory@xcite , the current - current correlation function@xcite , and the meissner mass squared@xcite .",
    "however , in unequal mass systems , the formula of superfluid density seems quite different from the meissner mass squared@xcite .",
    "does the proportional relation between the superfluid density and the meissner mass squared still hold in unequal mass systems ? in this paper , we will derive the superfluid density and the meissner mass squared in unequal mass systems in a standard field theory approach where the superfluid density and the meissner mass squared are treated in the same way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we briefly review the formalism of the two species model . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we derive the formula of the superfluid density and compare it with s.t.wu and s.yips phenomenological method . in section [ s4 ] , we derive the meissner mass squared and show that it is not proportional to the superfluid density in unequal mass systems . the superfluid density and meissner mass squared in the breached pairing states are calculated in section [ s5 ] .",

    "the extension to finite range pairing interaction is briefly discussed in section [ s7 ] .",
    "we summarize in section [ s8 ] .",

    ", the thermodynamic potential reads @xmath264 in terms of the new inverse propagator @xmath265 this is just the @xmath266 picture of the loff pairing , which means the fermions in the cooper pair move together with a total momentum @xmath260 . to see whether the loff state is energetically favored , we take the small @xmath267 expansion @xmath268 where we have chosen a suitable z - direction such that @xmath269 .",
    "notice that a linear term in @xmath267 vanishes automatically .",
    "one can easily observe the following relation between the momentum susceptibility and the meissner mass squared : @xmath270 for large mass difference , since the meissner mass squared is positive in the small @xmath27 region which is just the window for loff state , as we have shown in the last section , we may conclude that the loff state is not energetically favored .",
    "however , we shall argue in the following that this is not the truth .    to give a correct argument we focus on the fact that the superfluid density is always negative for any mass ratio .",
    "notice that we can do any transformation like @xmath271 to evaluate the effective potential , since the phase factor in the condensate can be eliminated by any @xmath272 and @xmath273 satisfying @xmath59 .",
    "for such a general transformation , the thermodynamic potential reads @xmath274 with @xmath275 this arbitrariness of phase transformation is directly linked to the fact that the symmetry group of the model lagrangian is @xmath112 . to link the loff state and the superfluid density , we introduce a loff velocity @xmath276 such that @xmath277 with a suitable choice of coordinates such that @xmath278",
    ", we can do the similar small @xmath279 expansion @xmath280 also , one can easily observe the following relation between the velocity susceptibility and the superfluid density : @xmath281 this intuitive argument indicates that the energetically favored momentum configuration of loff state is @xmath282 , which means the single plane wave loff ansatz is nothing but the anisotropic state with spontaneously generated superflow @xmath51 if we identify @xmath283 .",
    "in fact , it is quite easy for us to understand this fact .",
    "the physical picture of the loff state is that the fermions in a cooper pair move together with a nonzero momentum , and hence they should possess a same velocity , not momentum . in fact , we have checked numerically that for general choice of @xmath272 and @xmath273 that the quadratic term in the expansion is always negative only when @xmath284 .    with the proper configuration @xmath285",
    ", we can evaluate the effective potential as @xmath286.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath290 are the energies of the quasiparticles @xmath291 with @xmath292 and @xmath293 . notice that a new kinetic energy term @xmath294 which vanishes in the equal mass case appears in the asymmetric part of the quasiparticle dispersions .",
    "in fact , this momentum configuration is the most convenient one to calculate the loff solution , since the anisotropic term @xmath295 appears only in the asymmetric part .",
    "now we give a preliminary discussion on the loff state with mass difference . for convenience",
    ", we assume the pairing interaction is restricted in the region @xmath296 with @xmath297 , here @xmath298 serves as a natural ultraviolet cutoff in the theory . in weak coupling we can safely neglect the terms of order @xmath299 and do the following replacement @xmath300 where @xmath301 is angle between @xmath302 and @xmath276 .",
    "up to now , all things become the same as those in the equal mass systems@xcite , and the conclusions there can be directly applied . if the chemical potentials for the two species are fixed , the corresponding loff window is @xmath303 where @xmath182 is the bcs gap , and the loff velocity @xmath279 is approximately given by@xcite @xmath304 defining the mass asymmetry @xmath305 we have @xmath306\\equiv\\delta(\\epsilon),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then can reexpress the loff window as the conventional form in equal mass case @xmath307 and @xmath308 . due to",
    "the relation @xmath309 the size of the loff momentum is @xmath310 we obtain the mass difference window @xmath311 in weak coupling , @xmath312 , the loff state can exist only when the mass asymmetry is very small , which may be realized in electronic systems .",
    "if the particle number densities @xmath47 and @xmath48 are fixed , we should compare the free energy @xmath313 . in this case",
    "we have the similar expansion @xmath314 which means the loff state is more stable than bp state . the loff window will be larger , which is similar to the equal mass system@xcite .",
    "such a situation may be realized in cold atomic fermi gas , such as a mixture of @xmath107li and @xmath108k atoms .",
    "finally , we calculate the superfluid density tensor and the meissner mass squared tensor in the loff state . since the rotational symmetry @xmath315 is broken down to @xmath316 , the superfluid density and meissner mass squared become tensors @xmath60 and @xmath317 .",
    "we can decompose them into a transverse part and a longitudinal part @xmath318 with @xmath319 .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal superfluid density read @xmath320 with the function @xmath321 defined as @xmath322,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the transverse and longitudinal meissner mass squared read @xmath323 with the function @xmath324 defined as @xmath325 in equal mass systems , we have @xmath326 and can prove tya5 they are both zero@xcite , which means that there are no transverse meissner effect and superfluid density .",
    "the reason is that the formula of the transverse meissner mass squared is just the the gap equation for the loff momentum , see@xcite .",
    "however , for unequal mass systems , the gap equation seems the same as equal mass systems , but the formula of meissner mass squared becomes quite different , and there are both transverse and longitudinal meissner effects .",
    "the formulae for the superfluid density and meissner mass squared we derived are based on the point interaction model ( [ lagrangian ] ) . in this section ,",
    "we show that the formula can be directly applied to finite range interaction systems , if we replace the constant gap @xmath27 by a momentum - dependent gap function @xmath327 .    with a finite range interaction ,",
    "the lagrangian can be written as @xmath328 where we have assumed that the interaction is static . for convenience ,",
    "we define the condensates @xmath329 and the gap functions @xmath330 if the system is translational invariant with @xmath331 , @xmath332 and their complex conjugates depend only on @xmath333 . in mean field approximation ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential can be evaluated as @xmath334 in terms of the inverse fermion propagator @xmath335 where @xmath336 and @xmath327 are fourier transformation of @xmath337 and @xmath338 . since the derivation of the superfluid density and meissner mass squared depend only on the fermion propagator @xmath339",
    ", we conclude that the formulae for superfluid density and meissner mass squared derived in sections [ s5 ] and [ s6 ] are still valid in the finite range interaction model , if we replace the constant gap @xmath27 by the momentum - dependent gap function @xmath327 .",
    "the bp state with zero range interaction suffers negative superfluid density , and is hence ruled out .",
    "it was proposed that the bp state may be stable in a finite range interaction model with large mass ratio@xcite , since it is the global minimum of the thermodynamic potential with fixed chemical potentials . for a complete study",
    ", we check now the superfluid density .    for a spherically symmetric potential @xmath340",
    ", the gap function depends only on @xmath341 and satisfies the integral equation @xmath342 for a given potential @xmath343 and fermi surface mismatch , we can solve the equation and then determine the ground state with the lowest thermodynamic potential .",
    "once the bp solution is obtained , we can calculate the superfluid density and meissner mass squared .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us concentrate on the superfluid density in the case with @xmath344 .",
    "the superfluid density is still in the form ( [ rhos ] ) but the coefficients become @xmath345 where the function @xmath346 is defined as @xmath347 with @xmath348 . for the point interaction model , we have @xmath349 and hence @xmath350 which leads to negative superfluid density , as we discussed above .",
    "generally , the gap function peaks at @xmath351 and drops down fast for @xmath352 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath350 and @xmath353 for @xmath354@xcite , and the sign of the superfluid density depends only on @xmath219 . the condition to produce a bp state with positive superfluid density",
    "is then @xmath355 if the slope of the gap function at @xmath225 is very large , the condition can be easily satisfied .    for the interaction with a momentum cutoff @xmath356@xcite ,",
    "the momentum structure of the gap function is @xmath357 for @xmath358 and @xmath359 for @xmath360 , and we have @xmath361 for all @xmath362 except at @xmath363 . since in general case the positions of the zero nodes are not exactly located at the cutoff , @xmath364 , the situation in this model is just the same as in the point interaction model .",
    "we have derived the superfluid density and the meissner mass squared for the fermion cooper pairing with unequal masses via a standard field theory approach . for equal mass systems ,",
    "the two variables are indeed proportional to each other , while for unequal mass systems , this relation breaks down . in the breached pairing states with zero range interaction ,",
    "the superfluid density is always negative , but the meissner mass squared is positive in a wide region . as a consequence , the momentum configuration of the loff pairing should be correctly established . we propose a proper momentum configuration for loff pairing with unequal masses and show that the single plane wave loff configuration in unequal mass system is physically equivalent to an anisotropic state with spontaneously generated superflow .",
    "these conclusions are valid only in weak coupling .",
    "whether they are valid for stronger coupling , especially in the bcs - bec crossover , should be examined .",
    "there are some problems related to the arbitrariness in the phase transformation induced by the @xmath365 symmetry .",
    "to investigate the goldstone mode or the phase fluctuation in the superfluid state , we often neglect the fluctuation of the amplitude of the order parameter and write @xmath366 . using the standard phase transformation @xmath367 we can obtain the effective action for the goldstone boson . however , generally we can transform the fermion fields as @xmath368 with @xmath369 and @xmath370 arbitrary constants satisfying the constraint @xmath371 .",
    "the low energy effective action for the phase field @xmath372 generally reads @xmath373=-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_q\\left({\\cal d}q_0 ^ 2-{\\cal p}{\\bf q}^2\\right)|\\theta(q_0,{\\bf q})|^2.\\ ] ] only when all fermionic excitations are gapped and at weak coupling limit , we find @xmath374 and @xmath375 are independent of @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "hence the result of goldstone boson velocity in @xcite is safe .",
    "this problem may imply that we can not safely neglect the fluctuation of the amplitude of the order parameter in strong coupling or in the gapless phases .",
    "another problem is the stability condition related to the phase fluctuation .",
    "the superfluid density @xmath64 is often regarded as a quantity to judge the stability of bp state@xcite .",
    "for simplicity we focus on the equal mass case .",
    "when @xmath64 is negative , it directly means that the loff state has lower energy than the bp state .",
    "however , this is true only for the standard loff state with @xmath376 . for general case with @xmath377 and @xmath378",
    ", we should check the sign of @xmath379 for all possible @xmath369 and @xmath370 . while @xmath64 is positive in strong coupling bec region which means bp state is stable against the standard loff state with @xmath376@xcite",
    ", there is no direct observation that @xmath380 is positive for any @xmath369 and @xmath370 , such as @xmath381 .",
    "if @xmath380 becomes negative for @xmath382 , a non - standard loff state with @xmath383 is energetically favored in strong coupling .",
