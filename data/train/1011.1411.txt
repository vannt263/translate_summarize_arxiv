    "the identification of the dark matter particle is one of the most challenging problems in astroparticle physics today .",
    "we know that dark matter exists , for the evidence in its favor is varied and overwhelming .",
    "it comes , among others , from rotation curves in galaxies , gravitational lensing effects in clusters of galaxies , the large scale structure of the universe , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the anisotropies in the cmb , in fact , indicate that while dark matter accounts for about @xmath4 of the energy density of the universe , baryonic matter reaches only around @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "most of the matter in the universe , therefore , is in the form of dark matter .",
    "and yet we still ignore what dark matter consists of .",
    "currently there is a huge experimental effort aimed at detecting the dark matter particle and determining its main properties .",
    "dark matter particles can be detected , for example , via nuclear recoil as they scatter off nuclei in _ direct _ detection experiments . in recent years ,",
    "direct detection experiments such as cdms  @xcite or xenon  @xcite have been continuously improving the constraints on the spin - independent dark matter - nucleon cross section , and they have started to probe interesting regions of the parameter space of common dark matter models .",
    "the _ indirect _ detection of dark matter , which relies on the annihilation of dark matter particles rather than on their scatterings , is another promising avenue toward the identification of the dark matter .",
    "dark matter annihilations may produce photons , antimatter ( positrons and antiprotons mainly ) and neutrinos that can be detected as exotic components in cosmic rays . at present , several experiments including fermi ( photons )  @xcite , pamela ( antimatter )  @xcite and icecube ( neutrinos )  @xcite are already taking data and setting some constraints on the dark matter properties . finally , dark matter particles or other particles associated with it",
    "may also be produced and detected in colliders such as the lhc .",
    "it may be that the lhc soon finds evidence of physics beyond the standard model that sheds some light on the dark matter puzzle .    in parallel with this experimental effort",
    ", there has been a lot of interest in the theoretical aspects of dark matter .",
    "even though extremely successful in describing collider experiments , the standard model of particle physics does not include any viable dark matter candidate .",
    "dark matter , therefore , provides compelling evidence for the existence of new physics , of physics beyond the standard model . over the years",
    ", many dark matter candidates have been proposed in different scenarios for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "they include the neutralino  @xcite and the gravitino  @xcite in supersymmetric models , the lightest kaluza - klein particle in universal extra dimensional models  @xcite , as well as the singlet scalar@xcite or the inert higgs@xcite that appear in minimal extensions of the standard model .",
    "thanks to the simplicity of the underlying model and to the rich phenomenology associated with it , the inert higgs the lightest odd particle of the inert doublet model has earned a special place among them as one of the most attractive dark matter candidates considered in the recent literature .    in the inert doublet model , a higgs doublet @xmath6 , odd under a new @xmath7 symmetry ,",
    "is added to the standard model particle content .",
    "the lightest inert ( odd ) particle , @xmath8 , turns out to be stable and hence a suitable dark matter candidate . after being introduced in @xcite ,",
    "this model has been extensively studied in a number of recent works @xcite . in @xcite , it was extended with odd right - handed neutrinos so as to explain neutrino masses .",
    "then , in @xcite , it was proposed as a possible way to increase the higgs mass without contradicting electroweak precision data . regarding dark matter ,",
    "the main features of the model were systematically analyzed in @xcite .",
    "later on , in @xcite , it was shown that the annihilation of inert higgs dark matter can give rise to significant gamma ray lines .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that , for masses between @xmath9 and @xmath0 , dark matter annihilations are usually dominated by three - body final states consisting of a real and a virtual @xmath10 @xcite , rather than by the two - body final states considered in previous works . a result that has important implications for the determination of the viable parameter space of the model and for the detection prospects of inert higgs dark matter .",
    "these various studies have established that in the inert doublet model the dark matter constraint can only be satisfied within specific regions of the parameter space .",
    "three viable regions have been identified : a low mass regime , with @xmath11 , where dark matter annihilates exclusively into fermion pairs ; an intermediate mass regime , with @xmath12 , where dark matter annihilations are dominated by the final states @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and where coannihilations with @xmath15 may also play a role in the determination of the relic density ; and a heavy mass regime , @xmath16 , where the annihilation into gauge bosons is dominant and the mass splitting between the inert particles is small .",
    "we demonstrate in this paper the existence of another viable region of the inert doublet model , a region that had been overlooked in previous analysis .",
    "this region features dark matter masses between @xmath0 and about @xmath1 and is compatible with the relic density constraint thanks to cancellations among the different diagrams that contribute to dark matter annihilation into gauge bosons .",
    "it is our goal to introduce this new viable region and to analyze its main properties .",
    "we determine its position in the multidimensional parameter space of the inert doublet model and study its implications for the direct and indirect detection of inert higgs dark matter .",
    "remarkably , we find that this new viable region will be entirely and easily probed by the next generation of direct dark matter detection experiments such as xenon100 .    in the next section ,",
    "the inert doublet model is briefly reviewed , with particular emphasis on the different bounds that must be taken into account .",
    "then , we describe in some detail the known viable regions of the model , those that are compatible with the observed dark matter abundance and with all other experimental and theoretical constraints . in section [ sec : canc ] , we illustrate , analytically and numerically , the existence of cancellations in the annihilation of inert higgs dark matter into @xmath2 and @xmath3 that allow to satisfy the relic density constraint for dark matter masses above @xmath0",
    ". the effect of the different parameters of the model on these cancellations and on the predicted relic density are studied , and several examples of models within the new viable region are provided . in section [ sec : new ] , we use markov chain monte carlo techniques to scan the parameter space of the inert doublet model and obtain a large sample of models within the new viable region .",
    "we then determine the main features of this region by projecting this multidimensional cloud of viable models onto several two - dimensional planes .",
    "the issue of the fine - tuning required to obtain the correct relic density is also addressed , and it is found that these models are not particularly fine - tuned . finally , we consider , in section [ sec : det ] , the detection prospects of inert higgs dark matter in direct and indirect detection experiments .",
    "the inert doublet model is a simple extension of the standard model with one additional higgs doublet @xmath6 and an unbroken @xmath7 symmetry under which @xmath6 is odd while all other fields are even .",
    "this discrete symmetry prevents the direct coupling of @xmath6 to fermions and , crucial for dark matter , guarantees the stability of the lightest inert particle .",
    "the scalar potential of this model is given by @xmath17\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the standard model higgs doublet , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are real parameters . as in the standard model , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be traded for the higgs mass , @xmath23 , and the vacuum expectation value of @xmath18 , @xmath24 , is used . ] .",
    "four new physical states are obtained in this model : two charged states , @xmath25 , and two neutral ones , @xmath8 and @xmath15 .",
    "either of them could be dark matter .",
    "in the following we choose @xmath8 as the lightest inert particle , @xmath26 , and , consequently , as the dark matter candidate .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the inert scalar masses take the following form @xmath27 notice that @xmath28 determines the mass splitting between @xmath29 and @xmath30 and is necessarily negative as @xmath31 .",
    "the mass splitting between the charged and the neutral components , on the other hand , is due to both @xmath32 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is convenient to trade for @xmath33 the parameter @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 as we will see , this parameter , which determines the interaction term between a pair of @xmath8 and the higgs boson , will play a crucial role in the cancellations discussed in section [ sec : canc ]",
    ". the free parameters of the inert doublet model can then be taken to be the following : @xmath36 from them the @xmath19 and @xmath20 parameters appearing in the scalar potential , equation ( [ eq : v ] ) , can be reconstructed via equations ( [ eq : masses]-[eq : lh ] ) .",
    "these parameters are subject to a number of theoretical and experimental constraints see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to prevent the breakdown of perturbation theory , the @xmath19 parameters can not be very large .",
    "we demand accordingly that @xmath37 the requirement of vacuum stability , in addition , imposes the following conditions on the @xmath19 parameters : @xmath38 since @xmath39 only affects the quartic interaction term among the inert particles , the phenomenology of the model is rather insensitive to its precise value . for definiteness we set @xmath40 throughout this work and",
    "use the above equation as a constraint on the remaining parameters of the model .",
    "accelerator bounds should also be taken into account .",
    "the mass of the charged scalar , @xmath41 , is constrained to be larger than @xmath42 @xcite ; @xmath43 must exceed @xmath44 to be compatible with the @xmath45-width measurements ; and some regions in the plane ( @xmath46 ) are constrained by lep ii data @xcite .",
    "another important restriction on the parameter space of the inert doublet model comes from electroweak precision data .",
    "the inert doublet , @xmath6 , contributes to electroweak precision parameters such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it turns out that its contribution to @xmath47 is always small @xcite , so it can be neglected .",
    "its contribution to @xmath48 , @xmath49 , was computed in @xcite and is given by @xmath50 \\label{deltat}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 this contribution originates in the @xmath52 terms in the potential , for those are the terms breaking the custodial symmetry .",
    "the higgs mass , @xmath23 , also affects @xmath48 via @xcite @xmath53 for large @xmath23 this contribution violates current experimental constraints .",
    "in fact , if no new physics affects the electroweak precision parameters , @xmath23 should be smaller than @xmath54 at @xmath55c.l . in the inert doublet model , however , there is certainly physics beyond the standard model , so it is possible to have a heavier higgs boson provided that the inert particles give rise to a positive compensating @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , the higgs boson can be as heavy as @xmath56 in the inert doublet model @xcite .",
    "it is useful to differentiate a light and a heavy higgs regime in this model . in the heavy higgs regime , @xmath57",
    ", @xmath49 should be positive and equation ( [ deltat ] ) implies that @xmath58 . in the light higgs regime ( @xmath59 ) , on the contrary , there is no correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath30 .    in our numerical analysis",
    "we implement the electroweak precision constraint by requiring that @xmath60 in agreement with present bounds @xcite .    finally ,",
    "since dark matter is the most compelling motivation of the inert doublet model , we also constrain the relic density of inert higgs dark matter to be compatible with the observed dark matter density .",
    "explicitly we impose that @xmath61 which is consistent with the wmap measurement @xcite . to ensure that the relic density of inert higgs dark matter is accurately computed",
    ", we make use of the micromegas package @xcite throughout this work .",
    "as expected , all these constraints can be satisfied only within certain regions of the parameter space , the so - called _ viable _ regions . before describing the new viable region of the inert doublet model the main topic of this paper",
    ", we will have a look in the next section to the previously known viable regions .",
    "in previous works @xcite , it has been found that the dark matter constraint can only be satisfied for restricted values of @xmath29 .",
    "three viable regions can be distinguished : a small mass regime , with @xmath11 ; a large mass regime , where @xmath62 gev ; and an intermediate mass regime where @xmath63 .    in the small mass range , @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "must be decoupled from @xmath8 in order to satisfy collider and precision test constraints .",
    "thus , the inert doublet model becomes equivalent ( for dark matter purposes ) to the singlet scalar model of dark matter @xcite .",
    "dark matter annihilations proceed in this case through higgs mediated diagrams into light fermions and are therefore dominated by the @xmath14 final state .",
    "interesting phenomenological issues related to this mass range , including prospects for the direct and the indirect detection of dark matter , were studied in  @xcite .",
    "recently , this small mass regime of the inert doublet model , in particular the region @xmath66 , received some attention given the results of dama  @xcite and cogent  @xcite experiments .    on the other edge of the mass range ,",
    "the high mass regime , between @xmath67 and @xmath68 tev , is quite generic for scalar candidates of minimal dark matter models  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of this mass range was given in  @xcite .",
    "they found that to satisfy the wmap constraint , a small mass splittings between the components of the inert doublet is required , @xmath69 gev . in this case , dark matter annihilates mainly into @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath70 .",
    "previous analysis , including prospects for dark matter detection , were presented in  @xcite .",
    "a more recent study showed that the high mass regime of the inert doublet could be responsible for the dama signal through inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "the intermediate mass regime , @xmath12 , is a particular feature of the inert doublet model which can not be reproduced in any other of the su@xmath71 minimal dark matter scalar models . for these masses , dark matter annihilations",
    "are dominated by @xmath14 and by the three - body final state @xmath13 , and the correct relic abundance can be obtained with or without coannihilations between @xmath8 and @xmath15 ( collider constraints on new charged particles prevent coannihilations with @xmath25 ) .",
    "given the richness and the simplicity of the physics involved , various studies have been devoted to the inert doublet model in this precise mass range .",
    "the first analysis of this parameter space were carried out in  @xcite .",
    "further on , it was shown that the annihilation of inert higgs particles could give rise to significant gamma ray lines  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the prospects for direct and the indirect detection of dark matter were considered .",
    "constraints from lepii data were derived in  @xcite , whereas prospects for detection at colliders were analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that dark matter annihilation into the three - body final state @xmath13 plays a crucial role in this regime , modifying in a significant way the viable parameter space of the model and the prospects for its detection  @xcite .",
    "notice , in particular , that none of these known viable regions includes the mass range @xmath72 .",
    "it is our goal to demonstrate that the lower part of that range , up to about @xmath1 , is another viable region of the inert doublet model . along this new viable region ,",
    "cancellations between the different diagrams that contribute to dark matter annihilation into gauge bosons are required to satisfy the relic density constraint .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the gamma ray flux from dark matter annihilations originating in a region @xmath74 of the sky can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the distance from the sun to the galactic center , @xmath77 is the local density of dark matter  @xcite , @xmath78 is the photon spectrum , and @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 for the galactic distribution of dark matter we consider a nfw profile  @xcite , @xmath81 where @xmath82kpc and @xmath83 .",
    "for definiteness we consider the observation region @xmath84 , for which there is available data from fermi  see  @xcite and the supplementary online material .",
    "the photon spectrum from dark matter annihilations , @xmath78 , depends on the annihilation branching ratios and has been obtained using micromegas .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma ] shows the differential gamma ray flux at @xmath85 ( left panel ) and at @xmath86 ( right panel ) for our sample of models . for @xmath87 , it lies approximately between @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and at slightly smaller values ( particularly at large masses ) for @xmath85 .",
    "unfortunately , these fluxes are much smaller than those measured by fermi  @xcite , which are consistent with the predictions of cosmic ray models .",
    "it is thus not possible to obtain any constraints from this data .",
    "let us stress that this somewhat disappointing result is consistent with previous analysis of fermi data , see e.g.  @xcite . in them",
    ", it had been found that present data from fermi can be used to rule out dark matter annihilation cross sections exceeding @xmath90 or @xmath91 ( depending on the dark matter mass and annihilation final state ) .",
    "such cross sections are much larger than those expected in typical models of dark matter and , in particular , than those we have found along the new viable region of the inert doublet model .",
    "along the new viable region of the inert doublet model .",
    "three possible ranges of @xmath23 are distinguished by different symbols ( and colors ) .",
    "the solid line shows the current bound from cdms whereas the dotted line corresponds to the expected sensitivity of xenon100.[fig : mh0sdd ] ]    dark matter can also be detected via elastic scattering with terrestrial detectors , the so - called direct detection method . from a particle physics point of view , the quantity that determines the direct detection rate of a dark matter particle is the dark matter - nucleon scattering cross section . in the inert higgs model ,",
    "the @xmath92 scattering process relevant for direct detection is higgs - mediated , with a cross section , @xmath93 , given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a form factor and @xmath96 is the reduced mass of the system .",
    "thus , it is proportional to @xmath97 . given the rather large values of @xmath34 we found , see figure  [ fig : mh0lamh0 ] , we foresee that @xmath93 will be significant over the entire new viable region .",
    "figure [ fig : mh0sdd ] shows the spin - independent dark matter - nucleon cross section , @xmath93 , as a function of @xmath29 for our sample of models .",
    "@xmath93 lies in a narrow range between @xmath98 and @xmath99 pb . to ease the comparison with present experimental data , the bound from the cdms experiment  @xcite is also shown ( as a solid line ) as well as the expected sensitivity of xenon100 ( dotted line ) @xcite .",
    "points lying above the cdms line are not consistent with present bounds whereas points above the xenon100 line are within the reach of that experiment .",
    "as observed in the figure , a non - negligible fraction of the new viable region is ruled out by direct detection constraints . in particular , most models with @xmath59 ( though not all of them ) have a direct detection cross section exceeding the cdms bound .",
    "no range of @xmath29 is excluded , however .",
    "the good news is that all these viable models feature cross sections close to current bounds .",
    "they are all well within the sensitivity of xenon100 .",
    "clearly , direct detection is a promising way of probing this new viable region of the inert doublet model .",
    "the inert doublet model is a simple and appealing extension of the standard model that can account for the dark matter .",
    "we have demonstrated , in this paper , the existence of a new , previously overlooked , viable region of this model featuring dark matter masses between @xmath0 and about @xmath1 . in this region of the parameter space , the correct relic density can be obtained thanks to cancellations between the different diagrams that contribute to dark matter annihilation into gauge bosons . in the first part of the paper , we illustrated how these cancellations come about and analyzed the dependence of the annihilation cross section and the relic density on the different parameters of the model .",
    "several examples of viable models were found both in the light higgs regime , @xmath59 , and in the heavy higgs regime , @xmath57 . in the second part of the paper , we made use of markov chain monte carlo techniques to obtain a large sample of models within the new viable region .",
    "these models were then analyzed in detail by projecting them onto several two - dimensional planes . from these projections",
    "we learned , for instance , that for @xmath59 the dark matter particle mass can be as large as @xmath100 whereas @xmath34 is small and negative ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "dark matter masses above @xmath100 ( up to @xmath1 ) can also be found but they feature heavy higgs masses and positive values of @xmath34 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "it was also noticed that the allowed values of @xmath41 and @xmath30 increase with @xmath29 along the new viable region , reaching @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , we addressed the issue of the fine - tuning required to obtain the right relic density and showed that all these models feature a small or moderate value of the fine - tuning parameter .",
    "finally , we considered the detection prospects of inert higgs dark matter within the new viable region . for collider searches ,",
    "the higgs decay decay rate begins to differ from the standard model one for higgs masses larger than 200 gev .",
    "the extra contribution resulting from higgs decays into inert scalars for @xmath105 gev might be observed directly at lhc .",
    "regarding indirect detection , the present annihilation rate , the dominant branching fractions , and the expected gamma ray flux from dark matter annihilation were computed . but",
    "no bounds could be derived from current gamma ray data .",
    "the direct detection cross section was also calculated and found to be rather large .",
    "a fraction of the new viable parameter space , in fact , is already ruled out by present constraints from cdms , and the remaining part will be entirely within the expected sensitivity of xenon100 .",
    "direct detection seems to be , therefore , the most promising way of probing this new viable region of the inert doublet model .",

    "<S> the inert doublet model , a minimal extension of the standard model by a second higgs doublet , is one of the simplest and most attractive scenarios that can explain the dark matter . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the existence of a new viable region of the inert doublet model featuring dark matter masses between @xmath0 and about @xmath1 . along this previously overlooked region of the parameter space , the correct relic density is obtained thanks to cancellations between different diagrams contributing to dark matter annihilation into gauge bosons ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , we explain how these cancellations come about and show several examples illustrating the effect of the parameters of the model on the cancellations themselves and on the predicted relic density . </S>",
    "<S> then , we perform a full scan of the new viable region and analyze it in detail by projecting it onto several two - dimensional planes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the prospects for the direct and the indirect detection of inert higgs dark matter within this new viable region are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we find that present direct detection bounds already rule out a fraction of the new parameter space and that future direct detection experiments , such as xenon100 , will easily probe the remaining part in its entirety . </S>"
