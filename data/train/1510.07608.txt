    "since times immemorial , the meaning of money has preoccupied industrialists , traders , statesmen , economists , mathematicians , philosophers , artists , and laymen alike .",
    "the great british economist john maynard keynes puts it succinctly as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for the importance of money essentially flows from it being a link between the present and the future . _",

    "that s why they call it money .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    money has been subject of innumerable expositions , see , e.g. , law ( 1705 ) , jevons ( 1875 ) , knapp ( 1905 ) , schlesinger ( 1914 ) , von mises ( 1924 ) , friedman ( 1969 ) , schumpeter ( 1970 ) , friedman and schwartz ( 1982 ) , kocherlakota ( 1998 ) , realfonzo ( 1998 ) , mehrling ( 2000 ) , davidson ( 2002 ) , ingham ( 2004 ) , graeber ( 2011 ) , mcleay _ et al_. ( 2014 ) , among many others .",
    "recently , these discussions have been invigorated by the introduction of bitcoin ( nakamoto 2009 ) .",
    "an astute reader will recognize , however , that apart from intriguing technical innovations , bitcoin does not differ that much from the fabled tally sticks , which were used in the middle ages , see , e.g. , baxter ( 1989 ) .",
    "it is universally accepted that money has several important functions , such as a store of value , a means of payment , and a unit of account .    however , it is extraordinary difficult to understand the role played by money and to follow its flow in the economy .",
    "one needs to account properly for non - financial and financial stocks ( various cumulative amounts ) , and flows ( changes in these amounts ) . here",
    "is how michal kalecki , the great polish economist , summarizes the issue with his usual flair and penchant for hyperbole :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ economics  is  the  science  of  confusing  stocks  with  flows . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in our opinion , the functioning of the economy and the role of money is best described by the monetary circuit theory ( mct ) , which provides the framework for specifying how money lubricates and facilitates production and consumption cycles in society . although the theory itself is quite established , it fails to include some salient features of the real economy , which came to the fore during the latest financial crisis .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to develop a modern continuous time version of this venerable theory , which is capable of dealing with the equality between production and consumption plus investment , the stochastic nature of consumption , which drives other economic variables , defaults of the borrowers , the finite capacity of the banking system for lending , etc .",
    "this paper provides a novel description of the behaviour and stability of the interlinked banking system , as well as of the role played by individual banks in facilitating the functioning of the real economy .",
    "the latter aspect is particularly important because currently there is a certain lack of appreciation on the part of the conventional economic paradigm of the special role of banks .",
    "for example , banks are excluded from widely used dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models , which are presently influential in contemporary macroeconomics ( sbordone _ et al_. 2010 ) .    some of the key insights on the operation of the economy can be found in smith ( 1776 ) , marx ( 1867 ) , schumpeter ( 1912 ) , keynes ( 1936 ) , kalecki ( 1939 ) , sraffa ( 1960 ) , minsky ( 1975 , 1986 ) , stiglitz ( 1997 ) , tobin & golub ( 1998 ) , piketty ( 2014 ) , dalio ( 2015 ) , etc .",
    "the reader should be cognizant of the fact that opinions of the cited authors very often contradict each other , so that the `` correct '' viewpoint on the actual functioning of the economy is not readily discernible .",
    "monetary circuit theory , which can be viewed as a specialized branch of the general economic theory , has a long history .",
    "some of the key historical references are petty  ( 1662 ) , cantillon ( 1755 ) , quesnay ( 1759 ) , jevons ( 1875 ) .",
    "more recently , this theory has been systematically developed by keen ( 1995 , 2013 , 2014 ) and others .",
    "the theory is known under several names such as stock - flow consistent ( sfc ) model , social accounting matrix ( sam ) model , etc .",
    "post - keynsian sfc macroeconomic growth models are discussed in numerous references .",

    "it is a simple statement of fact that reasonable people can disagree about the way money is created",
    ". currently , there are three prevailing theories describing the process of money creation .",
    "credit creation theory of banking has been dominant in the 19th and early 20th centuries .",
    "it is discussed in a number of books and papers , such as macleod ( 1855 - 6 ) , mitchell - innes ( 1914 ) , hahn ( 1920 ) , wicksell ( 1922 ) , and werner ( 2005 ) .",
    "more recently werner ( 2014 ) has empirically illustrated how a bank can individually create money `` out of nothing '' . in our opinion , this theory correctly reflects mechanics of linking credit and money creation ; unfortunately , it has gradually lost its ground and was overtaken by the fractional reserve theory of banking , see for example , marshall ( 1888 ) , keynes ( 1930 ) , samuelson & nordhaus ( 1995 ) , and numerous other sources .",
    "finally , the financial intermediation theory of banking is the current champion , three representative descriptions of this theory are given by keynes ( 1936 ) , tobin ( 1969 ) , and bernanke & blinder ( 1989 ) , among many others . in our opinion , this theory puts insufficient emphasis on the unique and special role of the banking sector in the process of money creation .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the process of money creation and its intrinsic connection * *  * * to credit in the modern economy . in particular , we address the following important questions : ( a ) why do we need banks and what is their role in society ?",
    "( b ) can a financial system operate without banks ?",
    "( c ) how do banks become interconnected as a part of their regular lending activities ?",
    "( d ) what makes banks different from non - financial institutions ?",
    "in addition , we consider a number of issues pertinent to individual banks , such as ( e ) how much capital do banks need ? ( f ) how liquidity and capital are related ?",
    "( g ) how to optimize a bank balance sheet ?",
    "( h ) how would an ideal bank look like ?",
    "( i ) what are the similarities and differences between insurance companies and banks viewed as dividend - producing machines ? in order to answer these crucial questions",
    "we develop a new modern monetary circuit ( mmc ) theory , which treats the banking system on three levels : ( a ) the system as a whole ; ( b ) an interconnected set of individual banks ; ( c ) individual banks .",
    "we try to be as parsimonious as possible without sacrificing an accurate description of the modern economy with a particular emphasis on credit channels of money creation in the supply - demand context and their stochastic nature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "initially , in sections [ lvge ] and ke we develop the building blocks , which are further aggregated in section [ simpleeconomy ] into the consistent continuous time mmc * *  * * theory . in section [ lvge ] ,",
    "we introduce stochasticity into conventional lotka - volterra - goodwin equations and incorporate natural restrictions on the relevant economic variables .",
    "further , in section [ ke ] we analyze the conventional keen equations and modify them by incorporating stochastic effects and natural boundaries .",
    "building upon the results of sections lvge and [ ke ] , we develop in section [ simpleeconomy ] a consistent mmc * *  * * theory and illustrate it for a simple economic triangle that includes * *  * * consumers ( workers and rentiers ) , producers and banks .",
    "section [ moneycreation ] details the underlying process of money creation and annihilation by the banking system and discusses the role of the central bank as the liquidity provider for individual banks . in section",
    "bankingsystem we develop the framework to study the banking system , which becomes interlinked in the process of money creation and propose an extended structural default model for the interconnected banking network .",
    "this model is further explained in appendix a for the simple case of two interlinked banks with mutual obligations . in section [ bsoptimization ]",
    "the behaviour of individual banks operating as a part of the whole banking system is analyzed with an emphasis on the role of banks capital and liquidity .",
    "the balance sheet optimization problem for an individual bank is formulated and solved in a simplified * *  * * case .",
    "the lotka - volterra system of first - order non - linear differential equations qualitatively describes the predator - prey dynamics observed in biology ( lotka 1925 , volterra 1931 ) .",
    "goodwin was the first to apply these equations to the theory of economic growth and business cycles ( goodwin 1967 ) .",
    "his equations , which establish * *  * * the relationship between the worker s share of national income and employment rate became deservedly popular because of their simple and parsimonious nature and ability to provide a qualitative description of the business cycle .",
    "however , they do have several serious drawbacks , including their non - stochasticity , prescriptive nature of firms investment decisions , and frequent violations of natural restrictions on the corresponding economic variables .",
    "although , multiple extensions of the goodwin theory have been developed over time ( see , e.g. , solow 1990 , franke _",
    "et al_. 2006 , barbosa - filho and taylor 2006 , veneziani and mohun 2006 , desai _",
    "et al_. 2006 , harvie _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 , kodera and vosvrda 2007 , taylor 2012 , huu and costa - lima 2014 , among others ) , none of them is able of holistically account for all the deficiencies outlined above . in this section",
    "we propose a novel mathematically consistent version of the goodwin equations , which we subsequently use as a building block for the mmc theory described in section [ simpleeconomy ] .",
    "assume , for simplicity , that in the stylized economy a single good is produced .",
    "* *  * * then the productivity of labor @xmath0 is measured in production units per worker per unit of time , the available workforce @xmath1 is measured in the number of workers , while the employment rate @xmath2 is measured in fractions of one .",
    "thus , the total number of units produced by firms per unit of time , @xmath3 , is given by@xmath4where both productivity and labor pool grow deterministically as@xmath5@xmath6if so desired , these relations can be made much more complicated , for example , we can add stochasticity , more realistic population dynamics , etc .",
    "production expressed in monetary terms is given by@xmath7where @xmath8 is the price of one unit of goods . similarly to eqs ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) we assume that the price is deterministic , such that @xmath9workers and firms share of production are denoted by @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the unemployment rate @xmath11 is defined in the usual way , @xmath12 .",
    "goodwin s idea was to describe joint dynamics of the pair @xmath13 .",
    "the non - stochastic lotka - volterra - goodwin equations ( lvges , see lotka 1925 , volterra 1931 , goodwin 1967 ) , describe the relation between the workers portion of the output and the relative employment rate .",
    "the log - change of @xmath14 is govern by the phillips law and can be written in the form@xmath15where @xmath16 it the so - called phillips curve ( phillips 1958 , flaschel 2010 , blanchflower and oswald 1994 ) .    the log - change of @xmath17 is calculated in three easy steps .",
    "first , the so - called cassel - harrod - domar ( see cassel 1924 , harrod 1939 , domar 1946 ) law is used to show that@xmath18where @xmath19  is the monetary value of the firm s non - financial assets and @xmath20 is the constant production rate , which is the inverse of the capital - to - output ratio @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath23 , which can be thought of as a rate , is measured in units of inverse time , @xmath24 $ ] , while @xmath21  is measured in units of time , @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "second , say s law ( say 1803 ) , which states that all the firms profits , given by @xmath26are re - invested into business , so that the dynamics of @xmath19 is govern by the following deterministic equation@xmath27with @xmath28 being the amortization rate . finally , the relative change in employment rate , @xmath17 is derived by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) - ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq11]):@xmath29symbolically,@xmath30thus , the coupled system of equations for @xmath13 has the form@xmath31    eqs ( [ eq17 ] ) schematically describe the class struggle ; they are formally identical to the famous predator - pray lotka - volterra equations in biology , with intensive variables @xmath32 playing the role of predator and pray , respectively",
    ". two essential drawbacks of the lgve are that they neglect the stochastic nature of economic processes and do not preserve natural constraints @xmath33 .",
    "besides , they are too restrictive in describing the discretionary nature of firms investment decisions . the conservation law @xmath34  corresponding eqs .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) has the following form@xmath35and has a fixed point at @xmath36where @xmath34 achieves its minimum .",
    "@xmath37@xmath38    @xmath39      in order to satisfy natural boundaries in the stochastic framework , we propose a new version of the of the form@xmath40where @xmath41 is a regularization parameter , and @xmath42 , @xmath43  are jacobi normal volatilities .",
    "this choice of volatilities ensures that @xmath44  stays within the unit square .",
    "deterministic conservation law @xmath34  for eqs *  ( [ eq16 ] ) * is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq14]):@xmath45however , it is easy to see that the corresponding contour lines stay within the unit square , @xmath46 .",
    "the fixed point , where @xmath34 achieves its minimum , is given by@xmath47it is clear that , by construction , eqs.([eq16 ] ) reflect naturally occurring stochasticity of the corresponding economic processes , while preserving natural bounds for @xmath14  and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath48    @xmath49    the idea of regularizing the goodwin equations was originally proposed by desai _",
    "et al_. ( 2006 ) .",
    "our choice of the regularization function is different from theirs but is particularly convenient for further development and advantageous because of its parsimony . at the same time , while stochastic lves are rather popular in the biological context , see , e.g. , cai and lin ( 2004 ) , stochastic aspects of the lvges remain relatively unexplored , see , however , kodera and vosvrda ( 2007 ) , and , more recently , huu and costa - lima ( 2014 ) .",
    "lvges and their simple modifications generate phase portraits , which are either closed or almost closed , as presented in figures can not describe unstable economic behaviour .",
    "however , historical experience suggests that capitalist economies are periodically prone to crises , as is elucidated by the famous financial instability hypothesis of minsky ( minsky 1977 , 1986 ) .",
    "his theory bridges macroeconomics and finance and , if not fully develops , then , at least clarifies the role of banks and , more generally , debt in modern society .",
    "although minsky s own attempts to formulate the theory in a * *  * * quantitative rather than qualitative form were unsuccessfull , it was partially accomplished by steven keen ( keen 1995)*. * keen extended the goodwin model by abandoning its key assumption that investment is equal to profit .",
    "instead , he assumed that , when profit rate is high , firms invest more than their retained earnings by borrowing from banks and vice versa .    below",
    "we briefly discuss the keen equations and show how to modify them in order to remove some of their intrinsic deficiencies .",
    "the keen equations ( kes ) ( keen 1995 ) , describe the relation between the workers portion of the output @xmath14 , the employment rate @xmath17 , and the firms debt @xmath50 relative to their non - financial assets @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "all these quantities are non - dimensional .",
    "kes can be used to provide quantitative description of minsky s financial instability hypothesis ( minsky 1977 ) .",
    "keen expanded the goodwin framework by abandoning one of its key simplifications , namely , the assumption that investment equals profit .",
    "instead , he allowed investments to be financed by banks .",
    "this important extension enables the description of ever increasing firms leverage until the point when their debt servicing becomes infeasible and an economic crisis occurs .",
    "subsequently , keen ( 2013 , 2014 ) augmented his original equations in order to account for flows of funds among firms , banks , and households .",
    "however , kes and their extensions do not take into account the possibility of default by borrowers , and do not reflect the fact that the banking system s lending ability is restricted by its capital capacity .",
    "even more importantly , extended kes do not explicitly guarantee that production equals consumption plus investment .",
    "in addition , as with lvges , kes do not reflect stochasticity of the underlying economic behaviour and violate natural boundaries .",
    "accordingly , a * *  * * detailed description of the crisis in the keen framework is not possible .",
    "symbolically , kes can be written as@xmath53where @xmath54 are suitable parameters , and @xmath55 is an increasing function of its argument which represents net profits .",
    "keen and subsequent authors recommend the following choice@xmath56    @xmath57    on the one hand , these figures exhibit the desired features of the rapid growth of firms leverage . on the other hand",
    ", they produce an unrealistic unemployment rate * *  * * @xmath38**. * *      a simple modification along the lines outlined earlier , makes kes more credible:@xmath58here @xmath59 is a regularization parameter , and @xmath60 , @xmath43 are jacobi normal volatilities .",
    "@xmath61    @xmath62    while these figures demonstrate the * *  * * same * *  * * rapid growth of firms leverage * *  * * as in figure * *  * * , while ensuring that @xmath63 , without taking into account a possibility of defaults * *  * * they are not detailed enough to describe the approach of a crisis and the moment of the crisis itself .    here and above we looked at the classical lvges and kes and modified them to better reflect the underlying economics .",
    "we use these equations as an important building block for the stochastic mmc theory .",
    "inspired by the above developments , we build a continuous - time stochastic * *  * * model of the monetary circuit , which has attractive features of the established models , but at the same time explicitly respects the fact that production equals consumption plus investment , incorporate a possibility of default by borrowers * * , * * satisfies all the relevant economic constraints , and can be easily extended to integrate * *  * * the government and central bank , as well as other important aspects , in its framework .",
    "for the first time , defaults by borrowers are * *  * * explicitly incorporated into the model framework .    for the sake of brevity",
    ", we shall focus on a reduced monetary circuit consisting of firms , banks , workers , and rentiers , while the extended version will be reported elsewhere .      to describe the monetary circuit in detail ,",
    "we need to consider five sectors : households ( workers and rentiers ) @xmath64 ; firms ( capitalists ) @xmath65 ; private banks ( bankers ) @xmath66 ; government @xmath67 ; and central bank * *  * * @xmath68 ; all these sectors are presented in figure [ fig7 ]  below .",
    "however , the simplest viable economic graph with just three sectors , namely , households @xmath69 * * , * * firms @xmath65 * * , * * and private banks * *  * * @xmath66 * * , * * can produce a nontrivial monetary circuit , which is analyzed below**. * * banks naturally play a central role in the monetary circuit by simultaneously creating assets and liabilities .",
    "however , this crucial function is performed under constraints on banks capital and liquidity . * *  * * the emphasis on capital and liquidity in the general context of monetary circuits is an important and novel feature , which differentiates our approach from the existing ones . * *  * * further details , including the role of the central bank as a * *  * * system regulator , will be reported elsewhere .",

    "the corresponding hjb equation reads : @xmath368    in the limit of @xmath369 the problem simplifies to ( but still remains very complex):@xmath370      instead of dealing with several independent variables , @xmath371 , we concentrate on the equity portion of the capital structure , @xmath168 ,  which follows the effective evolution equation :    @xmath372    where @xmath178 is the accumulation rate , @xmath373 is the dividend rate , which we wish to optimize , @xmath308 is the volatility of earnings , @xmath374 is brownian motion , @xmath375 are two independent poisson processes with frequencies @xmath376 , and @xmath377 are exponentially distributed jumps , @xmath378 .",
    "the choice of the jump - diffusion dynamics with two independent poisson drivers reflects the fact that the growth of the bank s equity is determined by retained profits , which are governed by an arithmetic browinian motion , and negatively affected by two types of jumps , namely , more frequent ( but slightly less dangerous due to potential actions of the central bank ) liquidity jumps represented by @xmath379 , and less frequent ( but much more dangerous ) solvency jumps represented by @xmath380 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 .",
    "below we assume that the dividend rate is potentially unlimited , so that a lump sum can be paid instantaneously .",
    "a similar problem with just one source of jumps has been considered in the context of an insurance company interested in maximization of its dividend pay - outs ( see , e.g. , taksar 2000 and belhaj 2010 and references therein ) .",

    "we shall see shortly that it is optimal for the bank not to pay any dividend until @xmath168 reaches a certain optimal level @xmath383 , and when this level is reached , to pay all the excess equity in dividends at once .",

    "we use generic notation to rewrite eq .",

    ", we use the method proposed by lipton ( 2003 ) and replace the variational inequality in question by the following one@xmath393where @xmath394 .",
    "the corresponding problem is solved in a relatively straightforward way by computing @xmath395 and performing the operation @xmath396 explicitly , while calculating @xmath397 in the usual crank - nicolson manner .",

    "it turns out that the time - independent problem can be solved analytically . since we are dealing with a levy process , we  have@xmath401where @xmath402 is the symbol of the pseudo - differential operator @xmath403,@xmath404denote by @xmath405 , @xmath406 , the roots of the ( polynomial ) equation@xmath407the corresponding function @xmath402 for a representative set of parameters is exhibited in figure [ fig13 ] , which clearly shows that all roots of eq .",

    "@xmath414       this graph shows that on the interval @xmath415 we have @xmath416 .",

    "in this paper we proposed a simple and consistent theory that enables one to examine the banking system at three levels of granularity , namely , as a whole , as an interconnected collection of banks with mutual liabilities ; and , finally , as an individual bank .",
    "we demonstrated that the banking system plays a pivotal role in the monetary circuit context and is necessary for the success of the economy . even in a relatively simple context we gained some nontrivial insights into money creation by banks and its consequences ,",
    "including naturally occurring interbank linkages , as well as the role of multiple constraints banks are operating under .",
    "the consistent quantitative description of the monetary circuit in continuous time became possible after the introduction of stochastic consumption by rentiers into the model , which enabled us to reconcile the equations with economic reality .",
    "we built a quantitative description of the monetary circuit  that can be calibrated to real macro economic data which we solved mathematically .",
    "the developed framework can be further expanded by adding various sectors of the economy .",
    "it is clear that more  advanced models will naturally provide deeper actionable insights , which can be used for a variety of purposes , such as setting the monetary policy , positioning banks for responsible growth , and macro investing .    at the top level , we considered the banking system as a whole , disguising therefore the structure of the banking sector and precluding investigation of defaults within it .",
    "it is hard to overestimate the importance of the quantitative approach that enables the description of a possible chain of events in the interconnected banking system in the aftermath of the crisis of 2007 - 2009 !",
    "hence , we expanded our analysis to the intermediate level , and demonstrated how the asset - liability balancing act creates nontrivial linkages between various banks .",
    "we used techniques developed for credit default pricing to show that these  linkages can cause unexpected instabilities in the overall system .",
    "our model can be expanded in several directions , for instance , by incorporating interbank derivatives , such as swaps , into the picture .",
    "it can provide insights into snowball effects associated with multiple simultaneous ( or almost simultaneous ) defaults in the banking system .",
    "finally , viewed at the bottom level , banks , as all other corporations , have a fiduciary obligation to responsibly maximize their profitability .",
    "given the specifics of the banking business , such a maximization of profitability is intrinsically linked to balance sheet optimization , which is used in order to choose an optimal mix of assets and liabilities .",
    "we formulated theconstrained optimization problem in the most general case , as well as its reduced version in a specific case of the equity part of the capital structure .",
    "although simplified , the reduced problem still includes such salient elements of the equity dynamics as liquidity and solvency jumps .",
    "we then proposed a scheme to efficiently solve the corresponding constrained optimization problem .",
    "we hope that our theory of mmc will stimulate further research along the lines suggested in the paper .",
    "in particular , to help to predict future economic crises , which naturally arise within the proposed framework .",
    "the author is grateful to russell barker , agostino capponi , michael dempster , andrew dickinson , darrel duffie , paul glasserman , tom hurd , andrey itkin , marsha lipton , and rajeev virmani for useful conversations .",

    "feedback and suggestions from participants in these events are much appreciated .",
