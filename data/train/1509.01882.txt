    "recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in the study of thermal nanomachines that are capable of converting disordered forms of energy , such as heat , into useful work . at such small scales , thermal and quantum fluctuations",
    "play a considerable role , and as such the work output and performance of an engine are characterized probabilistically by distribution functions .",
    "these distributions obey fluctuation theorems such as the jarzynski equality and the crooks equation  @xcite , which have been verified by experiments both at the classical  @xcite and quantum level  @xcite .",
    "there have also been recent implementations of miniature classical engines @xcite and proposals for the realization of quantum heat engines @xcite .",
    "effects of quantum statistics of the working fluid have also been investigated @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown for both classical and quantum systems that external drivings can allow a system to evolve adiabatically even when driven in finite time @xcite .",
    "this has applications in quantum control , and can be performed in three ways : ( i ) driving of a system such that , instantaneously , a state evolves adiabatically ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is known as counterdiabatic driving and as transitionless driving ; ( ii ) protocols for which only at the final time are the states adiabatically transferred , while there may be excitations at intermediate times of the process ( e.g. @xcite ) ; ( iii ) application of imperfect external drivings which do not allow for an exact adiabatic transfer , but close enough for most practical purposes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence it was suggested @xcite to use such external drivings to render the unitary processes of a thermodynamic cycle quantum adiabatic while being performed in finite time .",
    "this could considerably augment the performance of nano - thermodynamic engines as work exchanges are extremized by adiabatic protocols @xcite .",
    "however , implementing additional external driving requires resources which affect the overall performance of the system @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the implications of considering the necessary power in applying counterdiabatic driving both in a prototypical system such as the landau - zener model @xcite and also in many - body quantum systems such as the transverse field ising chain @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we then show that this cost may outweigh the possible gains in work extraction for slow enough processes due to the relative degree of adiabaticity in the dynamics .",
    "conversely , for relatively faster processes , the use of counterdiabatic driving can improve the work exchange , depending on the experimental realization of the fields .",
    "furthermore , we devise a general strategy that exploits the definition of work as a two - time measurement of energy @xcite to improve the performance of work transfer .",
    "in particular , we show that it is possible to achieve sizable energy savings by gathering information from the first measurement and then applying a specifically tailored driving to the protocol .",
    "lastly , we introduce an alternative measure , the exigency , to quantify the need for applying couterdiabatic driving which is related to the non - commutativity between the time derivatives of the hamiltonian and the state .",
    "this measure has the advantage in that it can always be computed regardless of whether the protocol for counterdiabatic driving is known .",
    "moreover , it mimics the behavior of the cost functions associated to the transitionless form of counterdiabatic driving and goes to zero when no external driving is needed .",
    "we apply this measure to the analysis of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the lipkin - meshkov - glick infinite range spin model .",
    "to begin with , we consider the evolution of a density matrix @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 under unitary dynamics of the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "counterdiabatic quantum driving is obtained by applying an external hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the projection operator on the instantaneous energy eigenstate @xmath6 of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "note that the driving in eq.([eq : htl ] ) is such that all energy eigenstates evolve transitionlessly .",
    "such a strong requirement is however not necessary when using counterdiabatic driving to enhance the work output in a process , since mean work exchange is computed by a two time measurement protocol @xmath8\\mathcal{p}^{m , n}p_n(t_0)$ ] where @xmath9 is the instantaneous energy of the @xmath10-th level , @xmath11 is the probability of occupying that level at @xmath1 , and @xmath12 is the transition probability from level @xmath13 at time @xmath1 to level @xmath10 at time @xmath2 @xcite . the energy measurement at time @xmath1 selects the state(s ) that will then propagate unitarily until time @xmath2 , in which the second energy measurement is performed , and the difference in the two energies measured is then one possible outcome of the work output .",
    "hence , given a particular first energy measurement , we can apply a suitable driving which preserves the transitionless evolution of only the measured state ( or a relevant sub - manifold of the entire system ) without the need of avoiding transitions between the other levels that remain unpopulated throughout .",
    "such a selected counterdiabatic driving for a particular eigenstate @xmath14 is given by @xcite @xmath15 .",
    "\\label{eq : hs } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      to quantify the power required to generate such external driving it is instructive to consider two examples :    a.   a single spin in a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath16 , with hamiltonian @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath19 , for a spin-@xmath20 system , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the vector composed of the pauli matrices .",
    "b.   a neutral atom in a time - dependent electric field @xmath23 such that it experiences a potential @xmath24 .    in ( i )",
    "the part of the hamiltonian attributed to the applied field is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xcite which can be generated by an electric current @xmath27 such that the power required would scale as @xmath28 and thus be proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "however for ( ii ) , this term could instead be proportional to the modulus square of another electric field @xmath30 , and thus the power needed would then scale with the norm of the driving but not the square of it as in the previous case .",
    "thus , while the power required to generate the counterdiabatic drivings scales as the norm of the driving hamiltonian ( we use the frobenius norm @xmath31}$ ] where @xmath32 is an operator ) , the exact functional dependence on power is strongly affected by the experimental realization @xcite .",
    "hence , the cost of countediabatic driving can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a set - up dependent constant and the index of the norm @xmath13 depends on the nature of the applied fields @xcite .",
    "the principle of its usage here as a measure of cost is similar to the constraints used in optimal quantum control studies @xcite .",
    "a closely related measure has also recently been used in the context of energetic cost of superadiabatic computations  @xcite .",
    "it follows that we can define the cost of applying the selected counterdiabatic hamiltonian @xmath35 in a similar fashion : @xmath36 which can be interpreted as the weighted average of the cost of driving each level @xmath14 , over the level occupation probability @xmath37 .",
    "in fact the frequency of use of a particular driving depends on the probability of measuring that particular energy level .",
    "similar to @xmath34 , @xmath38 is a parameter dependent on the particular experimental set - up , and in the following we set @xmath39 for simplicity .",
    "we are now equipped to analyze the implications of considering the cost of counterdiabatic driving in the performance of a work protocol . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the landau - zener model followed by the ising model for which the counterdiabatic driving term is known analytically and is shown to be closely related to that of the landau - zener model @xcite .",
    "the landau - zener model consists of a two - level system with the following hamiltonian @xmath40 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : htl ] ) for the system is given by @xmath41 note that it being a two - level system , the driving in eq .",
    "( [ eq : htl ] ) @xmath42 is identical to @xmath43 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hs ] ) @xcite . here",
    "@xmath44 is the first derivative in time of @xmath45 .",
    "we now compare the work done in absence of any additional external driving @xmath46 , with that done for an adiabatic process @xmath47 considered in conjunction with the cost of counterdiabatic driving .",
    "the counterdiabatic driving is beneficial only when the cost of producing it is lesser than the inner friction @xmath48 generated in absence of the counterdiabatic fields which incidentally , is also the amount of additional work extractable attributed to the driving .    for a landau - zener process",
    "where the state is initially far enough from the avoided crossing , the probability of populaton transfers decays exponentially with the timescale .",
    "this implies that the inner friction @xmath49 $ ] also decays exponentially , where @xmath50 is time - independent . as such",
    ", the cost of the driving would need to decay at least exponentially fast with the increase of the time scale @xmath51 , or the cost of driving would at some point be greater than the gains obtained by a perfect adiabatic evolution . however ,",
    "we find that the cost of driving always decays as a power law : @xmath52 this can be shown by a simple change of variables @xmath53 that yields @xmath54\\int_0 ^ 1 \\|{\\hat{h}}_t(s)\\|^n ds$ ] ( @xmath55 behaves analogously ) .",
    "it should be noted that this scaling is completely independent of the system and protocol used .",
    "hence , the usefulness of counterdiabatic driving will ultimately always depend on the particular process in question .    despite this inherently system specific nature of the relative behaviors of cost and inner friction",
    ", we introduce an entirely general strategy that reduces the cost of counterdiabatic driving regardless of the particular experimental realization .",
    "this involves noticing that while for a single two level system @xmath56 is identical to @xmath57 , and would thus cost the same amount , they are vastly different for larger systems , and the resulting difference in their cost can be very significant .",
    "to illustrate this , we focus on the transverse field ising model because it allows for greater analytical insights with the exact form of the counterdiabatic field known , while at the same time presenting a phase transition .",
    "its hamiltonian reads @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isingspin ] ) , @xmath59 is the amplitude of spin excitation tunneling while @xmath45 is a time - dependent transverse magnetic field . in the following we use a smooth ramp @xmath60\\}/2",
    "$ ] in order to avoid sudden quenches @xcite .",
    "now , we consider the case of two spins revealing the basic principles of our strategy .",
    "the hamiltonian , which we refer to as @xmath61 , is divided into two blocks , one which dynamically couples the state with two spin - ups @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and the other which couples @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "while the first block reverts to a two - level landau - zener problem , the second block is time - independent and hence requires no external driving . considering a thermal state as the initial condition and a change of @xmath66 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 we observe a significant difference in @xmath69 and @xmath55 ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "in fact with a probability that is dependent on temperature , the first energy measurement could pick a state in the undriven sector which would thus require no external driving such that @xmath70 .",
    "in particular @xmath55 can be as small as @xmath71 for small @xmath72 .",

    "as shown in  @xcite , where the authors are concerned with the groundstate , and focused on only the even sector , @xmath104 is a sum of independent landau - zener transitions and the counterdiabatic driving @xmath105 is thus given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 .",
    "again , @xmath109 depends on the state(s ) selected upon the first energy measurement . thus ,",
    "in a similar fashion to the case of the two - spins , ( albeit in a far richer way ) the first energy measurement may select a reduced portion of the even or odd sectors : @xmath110 , where @xmath111 projects over only the relevant set of quasi - momenta @xmath112 ( e.g. @xmath113 projects only over the set of even eigenstates ) , that are connected by pair creation or destruction operators ( see appendix a ) . as a result @xmath114 can be considerably reduced especially at high temperatures [ see fig .  [ fig:1b ] ( a ) ] @xcite .",
    "the reduction in the energy cost of the counterdiabatic driving can be further reduced for longer spin chains and is more significant when the initial condition does not include states whose dynamics entails small avoided crossings ( in this case the cost could be negligible ) .",
    "while @xmath69 and @xmath55 indicate the energy cost of achieving quantum adiabatic dynamics with external drivings , it can not always be computed because it requires the knowledge of the counterdiabatic field . moreover the counterdiabatic driving always ensures absence of transitions even when they would be perfectly balanced .",
    "for example the identity matrix commutes with any hamiltonian hence it does not require any driving to preserve it .",
    "we thus look for an indicator for the need of using counterdiabatic driving which ( i ) would be non - zero when a driving is needed and ( ii ) can always be computed .",
    "we thus study the origin of the need of counterdiabatic driving by analyzing the evolution of a density matrix which is given by @xmath115 with @xmath116 $ ] , where @xmath117 stands for the time ordering operator .",
    "since the initial conditions considered are diagonal in the basis of the initial hamiltonian @xmath118 ( this includes all thermal states ) , the lowest order in @xmath119 in the evolution of @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 + o(dt^{n+2 } ) ,     \\label{eq : evolution }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the @xmath13-th derivative of @xmath3 and @xmath13 is the lowest natural number for which the commutator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) is non - zero , details can be found in appendix b. this implies that the first term of eq .   which may contribute is at least of second order in @xmath119 .",
    "it follows that the instantaneous power dissipated by internal friction is @xmath123 @xcite , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the actual infinitesimal work while @xmath126 is the infinitesimal work done if the process was quantum adiabatic .",
    "this however does not mean that applying an external driving to make the evolution quantum adiabatic requires no power .",
    "the fact that the instantaneous variation of inner friction over time @xmath127 is negligible for continuous drivings implies that it is not the best measure of neither the need of counterdiabatic driving nor of its cost .",

    "provides a qualitative understanding of the cost of driving , making it remarkably useful as it can be readily calculated for any hamiltonian .",

    "this means that , even without knowing the exact form of the counterdiabatic driving term , @xmath140 , it is still possible to have a qualitative understanding of the cost of the driving by studying @xmath128 .",
    "we should note , however , that the maximum instantaneous cost is not always maximum at a minimum of distance between energy levels in avoided crossings ( as in the standard landau - zener problem ) because it also depends on the exact time - dependence of the hamiltonian parameters . for more asymmetric cases the instantaneous exigency @xmath77 can differ , even qualitatively , from the cost function @xmath141 . to further illustrate the advantage of the exigency we conclude with some additional examples in the next subsections : the harmonic oscillator and the lipkin - meshkov - glick model .",
