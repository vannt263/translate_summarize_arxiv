    "as is well known , different nonlinear models can possess spatially localized solutions for solitary waves@xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the solitary waves are analyzed in the frame work of integrable models which , however , describe realistic physical systems with certain approximations@xcite .",
    "two important examples of integrable nonlinear equations are the nonlinear schr@xmath1dinger ( nls ) equation , and the sine - gordon ( s - g ) equation . while the first one is known to form `` dynamical solitons '' , the last one yields `` kink '' and `` antikink '' solutions .",
    "these are also called `` topological solitons''@xcite .",
    "dynamical solitons arise from the acute balance of nonlinearity and dispersion .",
    "the origin of topological solitons is the balance of nonlinearity and constraints from topological invariants@xcite . along side",
    "these continuous equations , a pioneering example of integrable discrete differential equation is the ablowitz - ladik equation .",
    "this is often referred to as the integrable discretization of continuous nls ( aldnlse)@xcite . on the other hand , the standard discretization of nls gives the nonintegrable discrete nonlinear schr@xmath1dinger equation ( dnlse)@xcite .",
    "the application of these continuous integrable equations in physics is quite extensive .",
    "the nls , which has both dark and bright solitons , was first used to understand self - focussing and self - defocussing of carrier waves@xcite .",
    "this equation later made inroads in the field of biological energy transport in the guise of `` davydov s soliton''@xcite .",
    "quite recently , the nls is investigated in relation to other phenomena , like bose - einstein condensates in standing waves , discrete solitons and breathers with dilute bose - einstein condensates , and the formation of unstable solitonic complexes@xcite .",
    "the mathematically very rich s - g equation has also many applications@xcite .",
    "it is used as a model for the propagation of dislocation in crystals and also for the propagation of magnetic flux in a long josephson junction transmission line@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the utility of the aldnlse in the analysis of physical problems is rather tortuous .",
    "consider for example , physically motivated models , such as coupled nonlinear atomic strings with onsite or intersite anharmonic potentials@xcite , array of coupled optical waveguides@xcite , proton dynamics in hydrogen - bonded chains@xcite , the davydov and holstein models(dhm ) for transport in biophysical systems@xcite , and so on . in these models ,",
    "either the aldnlse does not appear at all or it does not appear in its pristine form .",
    "however , to study the soliton dynamics perturbatively in these models , the aldnlse is the appropriate choice for the zeroth order approximation@xcite .",
    "this clearly shows that the aldnlse is an equation of great deal of significance in nonlinear science .",
    "for other applications of this equation we mention the following examples .",
    "the dynamics of low frequency and high frequency intrinsic localized modes in nonlinear lattices can be described to a good approximation by the aldnlse@xcite .",
    "again , in the study of dark and bright excitons in systems with exchange and dipole - dipole interactions , it is shown that in some limiting cases the evolution equations resulting from model hamiltonians are reduced to the exactly integrable aldnlse@xcite . as another example , we cite the one - dimensional fr@xmath1lich model of exciton(vibron)-phonon interaction . this model can be approximated by the aldnlse , provided we are interested in the dynamics of large width and small amplitude dynamical solitons@xcite .",
    "one other important use of the aldnlse lies in the numerical integration of the nls .",
    "this is done to avoid any numerical instability problem@xcite .",
    "any small perturbation may break the integrability so strongly that solitary waves can be unstable and in the extreme case may altogether disappear .",
    "the nonintegrablity in an otherwise integrable nonlinear equation can also give birth to internal modes , often called `` shape modes '' in solitary waves .",
    "these internal modes can drastically modify the soliton dynamics@xcite .",
    "the physical origin of integrability breaking terms can be many .",
    "for example , this type of terms can arise from taking into consideration the effect of thermal fluctuations and the possible absence of order in the system@xcite .",
    "however , the most important one is the discreteness of the underlying space .",
    "consider for example , the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model .",
    "it is the spatially discretizd s - g equation . while the s - g equation which is the long wavelength approximation of the fk model is integrable , the fk model in its generic form is nonintegrable .",
    "this nonintegrablity arises from the discretization reflecting the discreteness of the space@xcite .",
    "the other interesting as well as important example , of course is the already mentioned dnlse@xcite .",
    "so , relevant in this context is the study of an in - dnls , and also the modified salerno equation ( mse)@xcite . the in - dnls is a hybrid form of the aldnlse and the dnlse with a `` tunable '' nonlinearity . on the other hand , in the mse",
    ", the usual dnlse is replaced by a modified version of the dnlse , the adnlse which involves acousitc phonons , instead of optical phonons in condensed matter physics parlance@xcite .",
    "these equations are studied with the prime objective to understand the role of lattice discreteness as a mechanism for the collapse of moving self - localized states to stable , but pinned localized states@xcite .",
    "we further note that an in - dnls , which can be continually switched from the dnlse to the aldnlse by varying a single parameter , is also studied to investigate the discreteness induced oscillatory instabilities of dark solitons@xcite .",
    "there is at least one continuous nonlinear equation , `` @xmath2 equation '' , which is nonintegrable , contrary to its `` cousin '' s - g system .",
    "this @xmath2 equation can have either solitary wave solutions or `` kink - like '' solutions with permanent profile .",
    "however , these solutions do not have the simple collision properties of solitons .",
    "these solutions can bump , lock or annihilate each other .",
    "in addition these always emit some oscillatory disturbances or radiation in the course of a collision .",
    "furthermore , the head - on collisions of kink and antikink pair of solutions of @xmath2 equation will settle either to a bound state ( bion ) or to a two - soliton solution .",
    "this settling down is found to depend fractally on the impact velocity .",
    "we further note that all solutions @xmath2 equation have profound physical as well as theoretical significance@xcite . in continuation",
    ", we mention that the appearance of fractal structure in the kink - breather interaction is investigated using the fk model@xcite .",
    "similarly , a fractal structure in solitary - wave collisions for the coupled nls equations is reported .",
    "this structure is observed in the separation velocity versus collision velocity graph@xcite .    on the contary , to the best of my knowledge",
    "there is no known analogy of @xmath2 type of equation in the discrete case .",
    "here i propose an extended nonintegrable version of the aldnlse , which has a `` tunable '' nonlinearity in the intersite hopping term . at the same time",
    ", the form of nonlinearity is such that it can allow solitary wave like solutions , as seen in @xmath2 equation , and its suitable parallel in the linear regime is one - dimensional correlated disordered systems@xcite .",
    "inasmuch as this nonlinearity is in the intersite hopping term , it serves two important purposes .",
    "first of all , this extra dispersive correction to the aldnlse will try to destroy the ablowitz - ladik ( a - l ) soliton by dispersion .",
    "so , by varying this term we can investigate the effect of dispersive imbalance on the maintance of the moving solitonic profile .",
    "it is relevant at this point to note that both the in - dnls and the mse investigate the competition between the on - site trapping and the solitonic motion of the a - l solitons . in case of the mse",
    ", it is found that the narrow a - l solitons , having width smaller than the critical width will get pinned by the lattice potential@xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained numerically from the in - dnls@xcite .",
    "secondly , since the extra dispersive term in the proposed equation breaks the integrability of the aldnlse , the dynamics of the a - l solitons will not be transparent to the lattice discreteness .",
    "so , along with the in - dnls and the mse , this model also gives an opportunity to study further the effect of peierls - nabarro ( pn ) potential on the dynamics of solitons@xcite .",
    "we further note that the dhm yields a very complicated nonlinear discrete differential equation@xcite .",
    "so , to gain a better understanding of the dhm , a somewhat simpler but physically relevant system needs to be considered@xcite .",
    "this is another important motivation of this study .",
    "it is in fact noteworthy in this context that a slightly modified aldnlse has been studied as a plausible model for dynamical self - trapping in discrete lattices@xcite . as for further motivation of this study",
    ", we note that one rapidly emerging field in nonlinear dynamics is the study of the solitary - wave interaction in nonintegrable nonlinear models .",
    "the emergence of this field is due to the possibility of observing many of the predicted effects experimentally , including the soliton energy and momentum exchange@xcite .",
    "the model , that is to be proposed here allows with an opportunity to study the head - on collision of scalar lattice solitary waves .",
    "finally , nonlinear phenomena are quite a common occurence in all branches of natural science .",
    "but , our theoretical understanding of nonlinear equations , particularly that of nonlinear discrete differential equations is quite limited .",
    "so , when viewed from this angle , another important dimension gets added to the present study .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in what follows ,",
    "i first propose a set of discrete nonintegrable hamiltonians , and derive the equation of interest from the requisite hamiltonian .",
    "i study then analytically the existence of moving solitary wave like solution in this equation . since this equation is a perturbated ablowitz - ladik equation , i study this problem further using a standard perturbative method to find",
    "trapped and moving solitons .",
    "i consider next the formation of stationary localized states and the effective masses of these states .",
    "subsequently , i present some numerical results to substantiate the analysis .",
    "i also study the collison of two solitary wave profiles numerically using the equation .",
    "findings from my study are summarized at the end . in this section",
    "i also discuss the applicabilty and future scopes of the present work .",
    "we consider here the following hamiltonian , h.    @xmath3}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is understood that the hamiltonian , @xmath4 in eq.(2.1 ) describes a conservative system in which a quasiparticle ( exciton , vibron etc . ) moves in an one - dimensional chain . to obtain the time evolution equations for generalized coordinates , @xmath5 , we make use of the nonstandard poisson bracket relationship among these generalized coordinates as given in appendix a. after defining @xmath6",
    ", we get for @xmath7    @xmath8    in @xmath9 , arguements , @xmath10 have been suppressed , and @xmath11 . when @xmath12 , in eq.(2.1 ) and consequently in eq.(2.3 ) we have just an extra nonlinear nearest - neighbor coupling in hopping with a coupling constant , @xmath13 .",
    "this coupling is assumed to arise due to quasiparticle - phonon interaction@xcite . similarly , when @xmath14 , we have both nonlinear nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor couplings .",
    "coupling constants are @xmath13 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "so , in this model coupling constants are assumed to depend on the distance between the sites involved .",
    "for any arbitrary @xmath16 then , a given site , over and above the standard linear nearest - neighbor coupling , is coupled through nonlinear hopping to @xmath16 consecutive sites in general on both sides of it .",
    "of course , the origin of such coupling is assumed to arise due to the heuristic generalization of quasiparticle - phonon interaction beyond the nearest neighbor .",
    "we further note that in this model also @xmath17}\\ \\ = \\ { \\rm { constant}}\\ ] ] as in the original ablowitz -ladik equation ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "so , if @xmath18 for all m , we get @xmath19 .",
    "we now consider the following limits of eq.(2.3 ) .",
    "( 1 ) when @xmath20 for all @xmath21 , we have the salerno equation in the quantum version . in the classical domain",
    ", it has been nomenclatured as in - dnls and the formation of staggered localized states from this equation is studied@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) when @xmath22 as well @xmath23 for all @xmath21 , we have the standard ablowitz - ladik equation . this equation is known to have a single soliton solution@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) when @xmath24 and also @xmath25 , we have the model where exciton - phonon interaction affects only the hopping between nearest - neighbors . of course , to obtain this particular nonlinear mathematical form of interaction",
    ", it is assumed that the lattice relaxation is faster than the quasiparticle dynamics@xcite .",
    "this is a very standard assumption which is used in the davydov s soliton@xcite and also in the rashba and toyozawa mechanism for the formation of self - trapped exciton@xcite .",
    "this equation is also studied for single soliton solution , using perturbation method@xcite .",
    "( 4 ) the equation with @xmath22 will be refered to here as the nonintegrable ablowitz - ladik ( n - al ) equation .",
    "consider again the situation where we take @xmath25 in the n - al equation and further ignore altogether in eq.(2.3 ) the term having @xmath26 .",
    "we have then a model equation which describes a truncated version of the model , in which exciton(vibron)-phonon interaction affects both site - energy and hopping .",
    "we note that a perturbative analysis of the full model is done for one soliton solution@xcite . here",
    "our plan is to analyze various aspects of the n - al equation .    before we proceed furthere , we define @xmath27 we further note that @xmath28 .",
    "this , in turn yields @xmath29 .",
    "so , in the limit of @xmath22 , we have from eq.(2.3 ) and @xmath30 @xmath31 and eq.(2.4 ) also remains valid with @xmath32 and @xmath33 replaced by @xmath34 .",
    "again , @xmath35 should have in its arguement @xmath36 , which have been suppressed for convenience .",

    ", we consider the transformation , @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the equation will remain invariant under this transformation provided @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "again , if @xmath40 , the equation becomes self - dual under this reflection transformation .",
    "in order to gain an understanding of the nature of the solution of eq.(2.5 ) , we consider the case where @xmath41 for all @xmath21 . as mentioned earlier , in this limit we have the integrable ablowitz - ladik discrete nonlinear schr@xmath42dinger equation(aldnlse)@xcite .",

    "mathematically , one soliton solution of the aldnlse describes two parameters , namely @xmath50 , family of curves .",

    "we also note that when @xmath61 for @xmath62 , eq.(2.5 ) then can be treated as a perturbed aldnlse . in this situation",
    "we can use the standard perturbation theory to investigate the soliton dynamics from eq.(2.5 ) .",
    "this aspect is considered next .",
    "the method is amply discussed in the literature@xcite . in this method , it is assumed that the zeroth order solution is the standard one - soliton solution of the aldnlse .",

    "this behavior is consistent with the physics of the problem .",
    "we consider now the case of @xmath129 .",
    "it has certain interesting twists , which is quite a common occurence in the dynamics of nonlinear systems@xcite . in the region",
    "i , that is , @xmath128 , according to our standard linearization based analysis , @xmath130 should be centers .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath131 should be saddle hyperbolic fixed points .",
    "the reason to have a saddle hyperbolic fixed point between two consecutive centers has already been put forward in the previous paragraph .",
    "our numerical investigation also confirms this result ( fig.2 ) . in the region",
    "ii ( @xmath132 ) , the linearization analysis tells us that all fixed points along the line @xmath129 are centers . to understand this scenario , we note the following .",
    "consider two centers , which are next but one to each other .",
    "outermost ellipses , encircling these fixed points can also intersect .",
    "we then have a convex lens type region in the phase space ( fig.3 ) . within this region of phase space ,",
    "phase curves will have no other option but to close around a point on the @xmath63-axis .",
    "this fixed point will also then be another center .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig.3 , which describes the phase diagram of the soliton dynamics in the region ii .",
    "it is needless to say that the phase diagram is very interesting and unique . to the best of my knowledge ,",
    "this is the first case where a chain of centers with no hyperbolic fixed point is found .",
    "the phase diagram in the region iii is shown in fig.4 .",
    "this region is defined by @xmath133 . according to the linearization analysis , along the line @xmath129",
    ", @xmath134 should be centers .",
    "this is indeed found in the numerical investigation .",
    "again , the same linearization analysis tells that @xmath135 will be saddle hyperbolic fixed points . from the numerical study with @xmath136",
    ", we find that upto a certain distance from each of these fixed points , phase curves tend to diverge from the fixed points , indicating their hyperbolic structure .",
    "however , after a critical value of @xmath63 , phase curves turn back to make close curves .",
    "this happens upto a certain maximum value of @xmath63 from the relevant fixed point on the line @xmath129 .",
    "after that value of @xmath63 , phase curves close around the nearest center ( fig.4 ) . in case of @xmath137",
    ", it is found that the phase curve with the intial value of @xmath63 , @xmath138 closes around @xmath139 .",
    "but , for @xmath140 , the phase curve encircles @xmath141 .",
    "so , for these two fixed points , the transition point is somewhere in between these two values .",
    "it is important to realize that in this part of the problem we find three important phenomena that are encountered in nonlinear dynamics , namely ( i ) bifurcation , ( ii ) discrete breathers and ( iii ) relaxation oscillations@xcite .",
    "we note that for @xmath142 , that is , in regions ii and iii , all saddle points are changed to centers ( fig.3 and fig.4 ) .",
    "so , we obtain a bifurcation in the phase portrait at @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore it is a saddle - center bifurcation .",
    "again , at this bifurcation point , it is easy to show that we have spatially localized but time periodic solutions .",
    "these localized solutions can be pinned at one of the permissible values of @xmath144 , namely at @xmath145 .",
    "these are by definition discrete breathers@xcite . to see it further , we examine eq.(4.9 ) .",
    "since at @xmath146 ,   b@xmath147 , from the first equation of eq.(4.9 ) we find that @xmath148 .",
    "the consistent solution is then @xmath149 .",

    "this implies that @xmath153 where @xmath154 . for this particular case , @xmath129 or @xmath155 . from the perturbative calculation of @xmath64 appearing in eq.(3.1)@xcite",
    ", it can be easily shown that @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath156 .",
    "the energy of the breather in terms original variables@xcite is    @xmath157\\ & = & \\ 1 + 2 g_{1}\\ \\frac{\\sinh{\\mu_{r}(g_{1 } , odd p ) } } { \\mu_{r}(g_{1 } , odd p)}\\   [ 1\\ -\\ \\mu_{r}(g_{1 } , odd p)\\ \\coth{\\mu_{r}(g_{1 } , odd p)}\\ + \\",

    "inasmuch as eq.(2.5 ) has a reflection symmetry , another discrete breather will be obtained by the transformation , @xmath159 .",
    "this is discussed later .",
    "we again note that our linearization analysis suggests that at @xmath160 , we have another bifurcation . this time it is a center saddle bifurcation . however , we find that in the region iii the phase portraits around @xmath161 are not that of saddle points .",
    "in stead these phase diagrams consisting of closed orbits , are made up of both stable and unstable manifolds@xcite .",
    "so , here we have a relaxation oscillations dynamics as seen in van der pol oscillators@xcite , in the zeeman models of heartbeat and nerve impulse@xcite .",

    "a localized state is called `` staggered '' if @xmath171 , and `` unstaggered '' if @xmath172 .",
    "we further observe that under the transformation , @xmath173 , eq.(5.2 ) will remain invariant if @xmath174 .",
    "this is indeed in accordance with the reflection symmetry of eq.(2.5 ) .",
    "this result in turn implies that if an unstaggered localized state , @xmath175 $ ] is a solution of eq.(5.2 ) , the corresponding staggered localized state , @xmath176 $ ] is then a solution of the same , provided @xmath177 changes sign for all j. to determine locations of these localized states , we shall specialize on @xmath25 case .",
    "this simplification will not affect the merit of the discussion . from eq.(5.2 )",

    "the next important point is the effective mass of unstaggered and staggered localized states@xcite . for this",
    "we consider the hamiltonian , h@xmath184 given by eq.(4.5 ) .",
    "this consideration will allow us to obtain expressions for the effective mass for almost unstaggered and almost staggered states along with the fully unstaggered and fully staggered localized states@xcite . to calculate the effective mass of nearly unstaggered localized states ,",

    "further investigations along this line by altering the strength of the nonintegrable term by altering the value of @xmath48 reveal that the extent of distortion and the extent of emission of phonons by the initial solitary wave profiles ( eq.(6.3 ) and eq.(6.4 ) ) depend on the magnitude of the nonintegrable term .",
    "we conclude from these two findings that any general solitary wave profile due to the presence of the nonintegrable term in eq.(2.5 ) is subjected to both the dynamical imbalance between the nonlinearity and the dispersion , and to the pn potential .",
    "we note that the continuous translational symmetry of these solitary wave profiles breaks down due to the nonintegrable term in eq.(2.5 ) .",
    "consequently , these profiles scan the lattice discreteness in the propagation .",
    "this , in turn implies that the moving profiles experience the effect of pn potential in the dynamics .",
    "since , any general solitary wave profile suffers from these two factors , we expect that the profile can either be trapped by emiting phonons or the localized structure will spread uniformly due to the effect of extra dispersion . notwithstanding the slowing down of initial profiles",
    "are observed in our simulations , our numerical study in this matter , however , is not conclusive .",
    "so , a more elaborate study increasing the coupling constants in the nonintegrable term in eq.(2.5 ) and also changing the parameter @xmath47 in eq.(3.1 ) is needed .",
    "this will be done in future .",
    "finally , the n - al equation ( eq.(2.5))is the discrete analog of the famous @xmath2 equation , however with an important difference , that this equation only gives dynamical solitary wave like solutions .",
    "none the less , the importance of the n - al equation in this regard can not be overlooked .",
    "this equation gives the opportunity for the first time to study the collision dynamics of solitary wave profiles using a discrete nonlinear nonintegrable equation .",
    "here only the collision of two solitary wave profiles are studied ( eq.(6.5 ) ) . in this study",
    "we find that at least the interaction of two solitary wave profiles have some universal features , meaning that the outcome does not depend critically on the nature of the nonlinear equation .",
    "it is also equally true that we do not find so far any systematic pattern in the dynamics .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to study this problem in details both analytically and numerically to discern if there is any specific pattern in the dynamics .",
    "another imporatnt aspect to study is the fractal structure of the emeging profile after the collision as a function of the initial velocity and the strength of the nonintegrable term@xcite .",
    "we conclude by noting that this study offers a very significant insight into the transport properties of the dhm .",
    "furthermore , the n - al equation can be used to study transport properties of localized states in soft molecular chains , having the coexsistence of nonlinearity and disorder , nolinearity and quasiperiodicity or incommesurabily in various parameters , such as the hopping integral , j and the nonintegrable coupling constants , @xmath274 .",
    "furthermore , the aplicability of the n - al equation in the study exciton dynamics in photosynthesis and in molecular solids should be explored .",
    "we consider a dynamical system having 2 n generalized coordinates , @xmath275 .",
    "let u and v be any two general dynamical variables of the system .",
    "we now define a nonstandard poisson bracket@xcite @xmath276 , we then have @xcite @xmath277 from eq.(a1 ) we further have for @xmath278 @xmath279 then when @xmath280 and @xmath281 , we have from eq.(a1 ) @xmath282 we then write for the dynamical evolution of the m - th generalized coordinate , @xmath283@xcite @xmath284 this is consistent because @xmath285 we note now that when @xmath286 , we have @xmath287 . in other words , @xmath288 is a constant of motion .",
    "consider @xmath289 given by eq.(2.4 ) . to show that it is a constant of motion , we write @xmath290 , where we define @xmath291",
    "we then find that @xmath292.\\ ] ] by using ( a7 ) and ( a8 ) , it is very simple to show that the right hand side of ( a9 ) is zero . hence , @xmath289 is a constant of motion .",
