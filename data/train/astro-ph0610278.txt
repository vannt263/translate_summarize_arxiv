    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are semi - detached binary stars with orbital periods ( @xmath1 ) typically of the order of hours , consisting of a white dwarf primary accreting from a companion that is usually a late - type , approximately main - sequence star .",
    "@xcite gives a comprehensive review of the subject .",
    "an important question in current cv research concerns the secular evolution of these systems .",
    "the evolution of cvs is of interest in its own right ( it determines the size and properties of the galactic cv population ) , but also because the processes thought to drive it are equally relevant to all close binary systems containing a late - type component .",
    "binary star evolution is driven by loss of orbital angular momentum ( @xmath2 ) through gravitational quadrupole radiation , and , in at least some cases , the much more efficient mechanism of magnetic braking ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the time derivative of the orbital period ( @xmath3 ) and orbital angular momentum ( @xmath4 ) are related by @xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the white dwarf and secondary mass respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are their time derivatives , and @xmath10 is the mass ratio .",
    "equation  [ eq : pdot ] implies that the orbital period distribution of cvs is a useful indicator in the study of their evolution ",
    "loss of angular momentum and the resulting mass transfer changes @xmath1 . in practise",
    ", @xmath1 is also the only parameter accurately measured for a large number of systems .",
    "most studies of the evolution of cvs are therefore aimed at accounting for the observed @xmath1 distribution .",
    "this distribution is shown in the left hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : porb ] .",
    "its most striking features are the period gap ( a pronounced drop in the number of systems at @xmath11  h ) , and the period minimum ( a sharp cut - off in the period distribution of hydrogen rich cvs at about 80  min ) .    the period gap is usually explained as resulting from disrupted magnetic braking ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in a cv approaching the upper edge of the period gap",
    ", @xmath7 is approaching the value where the internal structure of a low - mass main - sequence star changes from a deep convective envelope to fully convective .",
    "when the secondary loses its radiative core , its magnetic field structure is proposed to change , causing the magnetic braking mechanism to become less efficient , or to cease operating altogether .",
    "angular momentum loss then proceeds at the much lower rate allowed by gravitational radiation .",
    "because of its history of rapid mass loss , the secondary is at this point out of thermal equilibrium , which it now regains by shrinking in radius , thereby losing contact with its roche lobe , and only regaining it when @xmath1 has decreased to approximately 2  h.    the disrupted magnetic braking model is broadly consistent with observational estimates of mass transfer rates ( @xmath12 ) in cvs  these are on average much higher for long - period systems ( @xmath13  h ) than for systems at @xmath14  h ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "that magnetic braking should be disrupted has , however , been challenged both on theoretical @xcite and observational @xcite grounds .",
    "nevertheless , disrupted magnetic braking remains the conventional explanation for the period gap , and a cornerstone of cv evolution theory .",
    "( black ) and @xmath15 ( dark grey ) .",
    "the magnitudes are mag1 from @xcite , and are actually not in all cases @xmath16 .",
    "we chose @xmath17 as a divide because this is roughly the magnitude where it becomes difficult to measure @xmath1 from radial velocity variations with a 2-m class telescope .",
    "the period gap is indicated by light grey shading of the range @xmath18 in both panels .",
    ", width=317 ]    the period minimum is a consequence of the response of a secondary of very small mass to continuing mass loss ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mass loss time - scale increases as @xmath7 decreases , but the thermal time - scale of the secondary increases faster .",
    "when the thermal time - scale exceeds the mass - transfer time - scale , the secondary is not able to shrink fast enough ( or in fact expands ) in response to mass loss , so that the orbital evolution slowly moves back through longer periods .",
    "cvs in this phase of evolution are referred to as ` period bouncers ' .",
    "the rudiments of the theory of cv evolution , outlined above , have long been accepted , yet there are still significant discrepancies between the predictions of theory and the properties of the observed cv sample .",
    "one of the problems is that theoretical models persistently put the period minimum about 10  min short of the observed cut off ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "population synthesis studies also predict that @xmath19% of the intrinsic galactic cv population should consist of systems with @xmath14  h , and that about 70% should be period bouncers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first of these predictions is not reflected in the known sample of cvs  long - period systems comprise significantly more than 1% of observed cvs ( see e.g. the left hand panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : porb ] ) .",
    "furthermore , only a handful of known systems are likely period bouncers ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , if the standard theory of cv evolution is even approximately correct , the observed cv sample is not representative of the intrinsic population .",
    "however , since different types of cvs differ in intrinsic brightness , and all surveys are flux limited ( and the majority severely so ) there is no reason to think that an observed sample should be representative of the intrinsic population .",
    "apparent brightness and large amplitude variability are two factors that obviously affect the discovery probability of a cv .",
    "since both intrinsic brightness and the frequency of large amplitude brightness variations decrease with @xmath12 , short - period , low-@xmath12 systems are necessarily under - represented in the known sample .",
    "the question is only whether these and other selection effects can account for the size of the discrepancy between the period distributions of the predicted and observed samples . the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : porb ] goes some way towards illustrating the importance of the apparent magnitudes , by comparing the period distributions of bright and faint sub - samples of known cvs .",
    "the ratio of the number of short- to long - period cvs is larger when only apparantly faint systems are considered .",
    "although detailed models of the intrinsic cv population exist , very little effort has been made to model even the simplest observational selection effects .",
    "it is therefore not clear to what extent theoretical predictions disagree with observations . here",
    "we present a monte carlo approach that can be used to model any combination of observational selection effects quantitatively , and use it to demonstrate how common selection effects influence the observed cv period distribution .",
    "we then apply our method to a well - defined observational cv sample to show that the intrinsic cv population predicted by the standard theory of cv evolution is indeed inconsistent with observations .",
    "we use a monte carlo model to determine the effect of arbitrary selection criteria on observationally constructed cv samples .",
    "the key parameters that describe a cv are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath1 and @xmath12 . given a description for the birthrate of cvs and a recipe for their subsequent evolution ,",
    "population synthesis methods can be used to generate the predicted intrinsic cv population as a function of these parameters .",
    "we generate a random sample of cvs drawn from such a distribution , and distribute them within a model galaxy . by modelling the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each cv",
    ", we can construct a predicted sample corresponding to an observational cv sample subject to given selection criteria .",
    "the starting point of our modelling is the population of cvs resulting from model pm5 of @xcite .",
    "this is the present day population of cvs that results from the birth rate model of @xcite when systems are evolved using the magnetic braking prescription of @xcite in the case of secondary stars with radiative cores , and gravitational radiation alone for fully convective secondaries .",
    "the population synthesis model provides us with a probability distribution function ( pdf ) over the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath20 ( the secular average @xmath12 ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "this model uses a bipolytropic treatment of the secondary , which becomes fully convective when @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting period gap is between roughly 2.8 and 3.2  h , which is not where the observed gap is .",
    "this shortcoming can in principle be overcome and does not have an important effect on the results we will derive , since the recalibration needed to improve the match to the observed location of the period gap has no serious repercussions for the overall population synthesis results .",
    "the pdf is zero at @xmath22 , and we use this value to distinguish between short- and long - period systems in the theoretical distribution .",
    "@xmath6 is kept constant throughout the evolution ; i.e. , all the material transferred from the secondary to the primary is assumed to be ejected during nova eruptions .",
    "period bounce occurs at @xmath23 .",
    "this is close to correct , although systems actually bounce at a small range of @xmath7 . ] , placing the period minimum at about 64  min . in this population , 99.7% of all systems are below the period gap , and 72% of all systems are period bouncers .",
    "magnetic systems are not accounted for separately , so if they evolve differently , as has been proposed at least for polars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , they are not included in the population synthesis model .",
    "furthermore , the largest secondary mass considered was @xmath24 , and all secondaries are assumed to be completely unevolved at the onset of mass transfer .",
    "it is worth pointing out that available population synthesis models assume a galactic age of 10  gy or more .",
    "there is evidence that the galactic thin disc is only 7 to 8  gy old , while the thick disc is no older than 10  gy , with a scale height of @xmath25750  pc , and a density more than a factor of 10 lower than that of the thin disc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". if this is correct , the oldest cvs in the predicted population should be removed , which would reduce the predicted number of period bouncers .",
    "our model of the galaxy consists solely of an axisymmetric disk , with no spiral structure , no additional thick disc , no halo and no galactic bulge .",
    "this is consistent with the population i assumption made in our population synthesis model and is reasonable , since the bulk of the intrinsic cv population resides in the ( thin ) galactic disk ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "every system is assigned a position @xmath26 in space , where @xmath27 is height above the galactic plane , @xmath28 is distance from the galactic centre , and @xmath29 is azimuth .",
    "the positions are generated randomly in such a way that the overall distribution of cvs produces exponential density profiles : @xmath30 @xmath31 where the radial scale length is @xmath32  pc , and the vertical scale height is @xmath33 adopting different scale heights for these three sub - populations is motivated by the fact that the long - period , short - period ( pre - period bounce ) , and period bounce regimes are successive stages in the evolution of a single cv .",
    "the age of a cv is the sum of the time spent as a detached binary ( pre - cv ) and the time since becoming semi - detached , and systems first make roche - lobe contact at a range of orbital periods .",
    "this means that there is a spread in the ages of cvs at fixed period ( besides that caused by period bounce ) , and , in fact , some overlap between the ages of sub - populations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , sub - populations have different representative , average ages .",
    "long period cvs are younger than @xmath34  y , while short - period , pre - period bounce systems are older than @xmath35  y , and it takes @xmath36  y to reach the period minimum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the scale heights of the 3 sub - populations given in equation  [ eq:3discs ] were chosen to be representative of stellar populations with ages of @xmath37  y , @xmath38  y , and @xmath39  y @xcite .",
    "we assume a galactic centre distance of @xmath40 @xcite , and ignore the small offset of the sun from the galactic plane ; i.e. , the earth is placed at @xmath41 . for computational simplicity",
    ", we divide the galaxy along the two planes of symmetry that include both the earth and the galactic centre ( the planes @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and simulate only one quadrant of the galaxy ; i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "interstellar extinction is computed by integrating the density of the interstellar medium @xmath46 @xcite along the line of sight to each system to obtain the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath47 .",
    "we find the proportionality constant in equation  [ eq : ism ] by setting @xmath48 for an object at the galactic centre .",
    "extinctions in the @xmath49 and @xmath50-bands are taken as @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .    by equation  [ eq:3discs ] ,",
    "the gaussian scale height of 190  pc found empirically by @xcite is compatible with the vertical distribution we use for the youngest systems .",
    "this measurement of the scale height was based on the known sample , which is strongly biased towards intrinsically bright systems ( this bias was even more pronounced two decades ago ) , and it seems reasonable that it may reflect the galactic distribution of only the brighter , younger systems . although younger stellar populations are expected to be more concentrated towards galactic mid - plane than older populations , the observational evidence in the case of cvs is slim or nonexistent ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as a check ,",
    "we therefore also performed simulations using the same vertical density profile for all systems . in those simulations we used @xmath53 which results from counts of m stars @xcite , or a gaussian profile , @xmath54 , \\label{eq : pat}\\ ] ] with scale height @xmath55  pc @xcite .",
    "four components , namely the accretion disc , bright spot , white dwarf , and secondary star , are included in the model of the overall sed for each cv in our simulations .",
    "we used a slight modification of the code described in @xcite to compute a 4d grid of accretion disc models over the variables @xmath56 ( the rate at which mass flows through the disc ) , @xmath6 , the orbital inclination @xmath57 , and the outer disc radius @xmath58 .",
    "we set the viscosity parameter @xmath59 for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 otherwise is small in all regards except @xmath0 colours @xcite .",
    "this is discussed further in section 4 . ] .",
    "the disc model assumes a steady state disc structure and produces a blackbody spectrum for optically thick regions , while for a vertical optical depth @xmath62 , the same procedure as explained in @xcite is adopted , so that emission lines appear in these regions .",
    "as will be explained in the next section , we take @xmath63 only for systems with stable discs ( these are a small minority of the population ) .",
    "cvs are assumed to be randomly inclined with respect to earth , so we select @xmath64 for each system as a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "the inner disc radius is set equal to the radius of the primary ( @xmath65 ) , which is calculated using the approximate white dwarf mass - radius relation of @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath58 will be explained in the next section .",
    "the bright spot is modelled as a blackbody extending over an azimuth of @xmath66 on the outer disc rim ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the flux contribution of the secondary is computed using the spectral type @xmath1 relation of @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 means a spectral type of g0 , @xmath69 is k0 , @xmath70 is m0 , etc beyond the @xmath1 range where it can be expected to be valid .",
    "since these very low - mass secondaries are faint compared to other components of the binaries , this is not an important concern .",
    "the @xmath71@xmath1 relation discussed below is also extrapolated to periods below the range where it is known to apply . ] .",
    "the secondary is assigned the absolute magnitudes that a main - sequence star of the same spectral type would have .",
    "this is not strictly correct , since cv secondaries are not in thermal equilibrium , but unevolved secondaries are not expected ever to be large contributors to the optical flux .",
    "we may nevertheless improve our treatment of secondary stars in the future by using the sequence of @xcite . in systems with @xmath72 ( i.e. period bouncers ) , the flux contribution of the secondary is neglected .",
    "we estimate the effective temperature ( @xmath73 ) of the primary using @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the absolute @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath16 magnitudes of the primary are then found using the tabulation for pure h white dwarfs of @xcite . in systems with @xmath75  g / s and @xmath76 , we assume that the white dwarf is completely shielded by the disc , and makes no contribution to the flux .      most cvs",
    "have values of @xmath9 that cause their discs to be subject to a thermal instability ; these systems are the dwarf novae ( we will abbreviate dwarf nova(e ) to dn ) , and they spend most of their time with @xmath77 , so that it is incorrect to use @xmath20 in the disc luminosity calculation .",
    "dn are characterised by outbursts during which their luminosity increases by typically 25 mag .",
    "outburst durations are days to tens of days , and the recurrence interval ranges from tens of days to decades .    to determine whether a system is a dn , we use equations 38 and 39 of @xcite ; systems with @xmath78 or @xmath79 have stable discs .",
    "none of the cvs in the theoretical intrinsic population satisfy the first inequality , so that we have no systems that are stable on the lower branch of the s - curve ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all short - period systems in our model population are dn , and less than 0.1% of cvs in this population are permanently bright , nova - like ( nl ) systems .    in order to calculate the disc spectrum correctly for the systems with unstable discs",

    "the secondary star does not dominate the optical flux of any cv in our model .    in order to allow for uncertainties in assigning appropriate galactic scale heights and outburst duty cycles to our cvs ,",

    "we note again that our population synthesis model does not include evolved systems , and does not explicitly include magnetic cvs .",
    "furthermore , our sed modelling does not make allowance for discless systems such as polars .",
    "these restrictions should be kept in mind when interpreting the results presented in the next section .",
    "in the present study , we restrict our attention to three of the most common selection effects present in observational cv samples , namely magnitude limits , selection for blue @xmath0 , and restricted ranges in galactic latitude .",

    "[ fig : sdss ] implies that , even assuming a galactic scale height that is probably unrealistically small , the sdss cv sample will by no means be volume limited .",

    ". the fraction of long - period systems increases towards brighter magnitude limits in all cases .",
    "model c1 produces the largest ratios of long- to short - period systems , and differs from , e.g. , model a1 also in predicting fewer systems at a given magnitude limit , and in that relatively more detected systems are dn in outburst . fig .",
    "[ fig : a1c1 ] compares the period distributions of all - sky samples with @xmath127 resulting from model a1 and c1 .    because of the balmer discontinuity , the @xmath49 band is the region of the optical spectrum where the sed modelling of the disc emission is the least reliable .",

    "the disc radiation has a negligible effect on the magnitudes and colours . anticipating the application in section  [ sec : pg ] , we are for the moment only concerned with the influence that incorrect @xmath0 colours may have when @xmath0 cuts are applied to samples with bright magnitude limits . to determine whether an error of @xmath131  mag in the disc @xmath0 in systems with @xmath132 is important , we performed the following test .",

    "note also that , in addition to the discovery bias , a second bias is introduced in the @xcite sample by the need to find orbital periods .",
    "this is magnitude dependent , but it is also , e.g. , easier to measure shorter periods ( although this is not very important at @xmath137  h ) and there is a bias towards magnetic systems in deciding which cvs are worthy of follow - up observations to find @xmath1 .",
    "a quantitative comparison between theory and observations requires a reasonably large observed sample that has well defined selection criteria and quantified completeness . at the moment",
    "the observational sample that conforms to these requirements the most closely is the sample of cvs found in the pg survey .",

    "fig : pg ] that the distribution produced by the simulation is inconsistent with the observed one , the most obvious discrepancy being that the ratio of long- to short - period cvs is much higher in the observed sample than is predicted . if we conservatively assume that v378 peg is a short - period system , and taking the upper edge of the period gap as 3  h , 14 out of 27 observed systems ( 52% ) at @xmath150  h have periods above the gap . the prediction is only 6.7% ( i.e. 2 systems ) . according to the binomial distribution ,",
    "the probability that these numbers are consistent is less than @xmath152 .",
    "we also note that none of the pg cvs is considered to be a candidate period bouncer , whereas the simulation predicts that 19% of the sample ( i.e. 5 systems ) should be period bouncers .",
    "it was shown in section 4 that the properties of the predicted detected sample are fairly insensitive to poorly constrained aspects of our modelling of disc seds , galactic structure , and dn outburst properties .",
    "of all the models we have considered , model c1 allows for the largest population of short - period systems to remain undetected , because it combines a large galactic scale height for these systems with an extreme assumption of dn outburst behaviour . repeating this simulation using model c1 yields",
    "a prediction of 10% long - period systems in the pg sample , which is still inconsistent with the observed fraction .",
    "based on this and also on the sheer size of the discrepancy between the predicted and observed pg samples , we are confident that the predicted intrinsic population that is the basis of our modelling is ruled out by observations .",
    "we believe this is the strongest evidence yet that the standard disrupted magnetic braking model for cv evolution , with strong magnetic braking above the period gap and none below the gap , is incorrect .",
    "as has long been suspected , it predicts too many short - period systems , and , specifically , too many period bouncers .",
    "we have presented a monte - carlo technique that allows us to model selection effects in observed samples of cvs . given any theoretical intrinsic population and any survey with well defined selection criteria",
    ", this technique can be applied to predict the observed population .",
    "we have explored the impact of flux limits , colour cuts , and observing restricted ranges of galactic latitude , and finally applied our method to the cv sample produced by the pg survey .",
    "our main results are the following .    1 .",
    "the mass - transfer rates predicted by standard cv evolution theory are inconsistent with empirical estimates of the absolute magnitudes of dn in outburst , unless outburst duty cycles are much lower than is generally assumed ( i.e. @xmath153% for normal dn and @xmath154% for period bouncers ) .",
    "2 .   for practically achievable flux limits ,",
    "no flux limited sample can be expected to reproduce the intrinsic cv population .",
    "it is therefore quite inappropriate to compare an observed sample with the predicted intrinsic population .",
    "the properties of the period distribution of a magnitude limited sample depend strongly on the magnitude limit . the ratio of short- to long - period systems and the prominence of the spike near the period minimum decrease at brighter magnitude limits .",
    "the apparent magnitude distribution of cvs suggests that the known cv sample is not approximately magnitude - limited , even if a limiting magnitude as bright as @xmath155 is adopted .",
    "a blue selection cut of @xmath156 introduces a serious bias against detecting short - period systems .",
    "however , for existing @xmath110-excess surveys , this bias is unimportant compared to the effect of the survey flux limits .",
    "magnitude limited surveys at high galactic latitude are expected to yield samples that are very different from those produced by galactic plane surveys , because they detect a larger fraction of all systems inside the volume defined by the galactic latitude range .",
    "however , a survey such as the sdss is still not deep enough to be volume limited for cvs .",
    "this means that , for some time to come , the effect of a magnitude limit will have to be considered when comparing an observed sample to theory .",
    "a simulation of the selection effects present in the pg cv sample shows that observational biases are not sufficient to reconcile the intrinsic population predicted by standard cv evolution theory ( with strong magnetic braking above the period gap ) with the observed pg sample .",
    "the real intrinsic cv population can not contain as large a fraction of short - period systems ( and , specifically , period bouncers ) as is predicted by theory .",
