    "two of the most notable facts of physics that actually enable us to make progress in understanding nature are _ scale - dependence _ and the _ decoupling _ of different scales . in a given system",
    "we usually observe dynamics at different levels because it possesses distinct relevant degrees of freedom acting at different scales .",
    "these ideas are clearly illustrated by a fluid .",
    "we need different theories to describe it as we change the scale length @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath1 the _ scale - dependence _ and the _ decoupling _ are evident . to understand the macroscopic dynamics of the fluid , described by the navier - stokes equation , it is not necessary to know string theory !",
    "these features naturally lead us to the idea that some properties , in particular , symmetries can emerge or disappear as we probe the system in different energy scales .",
    "the main goal of this work is to review some examples where the emergence of symmetries takes place , and how this can help us to face other complex and fundamental problems .",
    "this is a quite wide subject .",
    "naturally the problems discussed here reflect personal interests and are not intended to be exhaustive .",
    "we choose particular examples that illustrate some special features we want to stress , including recent developments .",
    "a comprehensive account on these subjects can be found in the outstanding reference @xcite .",
    "a very simple example of an emergent symmetry is provided by a two - dimensional flat surface , as the surface of a table .",
    "consider the motion of a probe - particle on that table . from our eyes perspective , which has a low power of resolution ( low - energy )",
    ", the surface seems to be perfectly flat , i.e. , invariant under translations .",
    "the motion of the particle on this surface is invariant under translations . now",
    ", suppose that we are equipped with a microscope with a higher power of resolution .",
    "we can explore this system in more details with more energy . in this case",
    ", we realize that the system is no longer translational invariant due to the roughness of the surface . to describe the motion of the probe - particle we need to take into account the presence of roughness , which breaks the translational invariance .",
    "so when we go from high to low energies we see that the translational invariance is an emergent symmetry .",
    "we can think of two types of symmetries : _ fundamental _ and _ emergent_. we say that a symmetry is _ fundamental _ when it is a symmetry of the whole spectrum of energy .",
    "this is the opposite of an _ emergent _ symmetry , which only manifests itself in specific sectors .",
    "the separation is tenuous once it depends on our capacity in exploring physics through several scales .",
    "most of physical theories consider lorentz symmetry as fundamental , but the possibility of lorentz violation in certain situations gives rise to interesting developments . in this sense",
    ", we can think of lorentz invariance as an emergent symmetry .",
    "these are intended to be review notes with main focus on the physical aspects rather than the computation methods . the basic framework to perform",
    "this type of investigation involves the renormalization group and the construction of effective field theories .",
    "the renormalization group essentially tells us how a certain system reacts under scale transformations , while the effective field theory method enable us to obtain low - energy description of the systems based on the identification of the relevant degrees of freedom and the underlying symmetries .",
    "we proceed to our discussion by examining several interesting problems in field theory , statistical mechanics and condensed matter .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "we start by discussing some basic ingredients of the renormalization group and of the effective field theory methods in secs .",
    "[ rg ] and [ eft ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ lorentz ] we discuss a first example of an emergent symmetry , lorentz symmetry , which will be instructive to classify the symmetry - breaking type operators in sec .",
    "[ softhard ] , where are also discussed further examples involving gauge and supersymmetry .",
    "next we pay particular attention to scale as well as conformal invariance in secs .",
    "[ cp ] and [ ci ] , since they are ubiquitous in phase transitions of condensed matter systems , in particular in two dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ as ] we discuss examples of accidental symmetries , occurring due to some coincident combination of degrees of freedom .",
    "[ discrete ] deals with the ultraviolet divergences in field theory , in particular in gravitation and how this hints for a discrete nature of the spacetime .",
    "we also make some comments from the string theory perspective .",
    "we close the work with some final considerations in sec .",
    "the basic framework to understand the behavior of a system under a scale changing is the renormalization group .",
    "we will proceed to our discussion bearing in mind a field theory but of course this is a very general procedure and could , for example , be equally described in terms of spin systems defined on lattices . from that perspective , the system is given by a lagrangian depending on a field @xmath2 ( or a set of fields but we will consider just one for simplicity ) , its derivatives and on a set of parameters @xmath3 ( mass , coupling constants , etc ) @xmath4 a basic aspect of the renormalization group is to compare physical phenomena at different scales .",
    "to this end we need to introduce an auxiliary ( arbitrary ) scale , denoted by @xmath5 , which is associated to the typical energy we are working ( in the next section it will be clear how this can be done ) .",
    "this is indeed an inherent property of the renormalization program .",
    "it follows that any physical quantity , @xmath6 , will be a function of these parameters : @xmath7 but does it mean that the physical quantities depend on an arbitrary parameter ?",
    "the only possibility for making sense of this is to assume that the parameters @xmath3 are functions of @xmath5 too , @xmath8 they become then effective parameters , also called running couplings , such that physical quantities should be invariant under changing of @xmath5 . this is expressed by the condition @xmath9 or , @xmath10 which is usually called a renormalization group equation .",
    "other objects of the quantum theory such as green or correlation functions satisfy also renormalization group equations .",
    "the @xmath11-functions are defined as , @xmath12 they dictate how the parameters of theory behave under changing of @xmath5 . by computing the @xmath11-functions we are able to understand how the system reacts under scale transformations .",
    "of special interest are the zeros of the @xmath11-functions , characterized by @xmath13 the values @xmath14 are fixed points of the renormalization group flow and once they are reached the corresponding parameters stop to flow .",
    "an important question is about the nature of a fixed point , i.e. , it can be attractive or repulsive . given a configuration in the parameter space near the fixed point , the system will flow toward or outward it depending on its nature .",
    "we have discussed in general terms some essential points of the renormalization group .",
    "but what about the lagrangian @xmath15",
    "? we will adopt the effective field theory approach to construct lagrangians .",
    "this is a very powerful method to deal with systems involving a large number of degrees of freedom . roughly speaking ,",
    "the strategy is try to identify the relevant degrees of freedom of the low - energy physics , compatible with a certain set of symmetries , and then describe the system in terms of a class of operators ( terms in the lagrangian ) responsible for the that dynamics .",
    "this can be systematically done by means of the effective field theory analysis described below , usually referred as wilson approach @xcite .",

    "our strategy is to isolate low - energy physics from high - energy physics . to this end",
    ", we introduce some cutoff scale @xmath19 , which supposedly do that separation .",
    "we are interested in studying the physics at scales @xmath5 much below @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "the field @xmath2 can be decomposed in two parts corresponding to the high - energy modes , @xmath21 , for momenta @xmath22 , and low - energy modes , @xmath23 , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 this can be made precise in the fourier space , @xmath26 the generating functional is then factorized according to @xmath27}. \\label{3.2}\\ ] ] the integration over high - energy modes can be used to produce @xmath28 } , \\label{3.3}\\ ] ] with the effective action , @xmath29 $ ] , formally defined by @xmath30}=\\int \\mathcal{d}\\varphi_h e^{is[\\varphi_h,\\varphi_l ] } , \\label{3.4}\\ ] ] such that the theory is now defined by the functional ( [ 3.3 ] ) which has no explicit dependence on @xmath21 . in general , the effective action can be expanded in terms of local operators @xmath31 that are constructed out from the fields @xmath23 .",
    "a bit of dimensional analysis is useful to estimate the typical order of the operators in @xmath32 . in the natural unit system , both",

    "we will write the dimension of all operators in mass units .",

    ". thus the typical order of the @xmath43-th term is @xmath44-d}. \\label{3.8}\\ ] ] the simple dimensional analysis above provides an important hint .",
    "it enable us to identify three classes of operators : @xmath45-d>0\\rightarrow \\text{irrelevant or nonrenormalizable}\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\mathcal{o}_i]-d=0\\rightarrow \\text{marginal or strictly renormalizable } \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\mathcal{o}_i]-d<0\\rightarrow \\text{relevant or super - renormalizable } .",
    "\\label{3.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that for low energies , @xmath46 , only marginal ( renormalizable ) and relevant operators contribute to the action .",
    "irrelevant operators are suppressed by powers of @xmath47 .",
    "that analysis furnishes a systematic way to construct effective field theories even if we do not have much information about high - energy physics : we just have to include into the lagrangian all marginal and relevant operators compatible with the symmetries of the problem .",
    "we have good chances to get a satisfactory description of the low - energy dynamics of the system .",
    "we have so far discussed some steps of the renormalization group without mentioning a single word about one of the well - known issues of any theory involving quantized fields , namely the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences .",
    "they show up as a direct consequence of the quantization rule @xmath48=i\\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf y}),\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is canonical momentum , that is ill - defined at coincident points .",
    "we want to discuss about this now .",
    "this is useful to clarify the meaning of the qft - nomenclature used in ( [ 3.9 ] ) .",
    "field theories are classified according to their operator content as follows . a theory involving only marginal and relevant operators",
    "is called _ renormalizable_. in contrast , a theory that contains at least one irrelevant operator is called _",
    "nonrenormalizable_. the difference between them is how the divergences appear in each case . roughly speaking , when we start the perturbative calculations we end up with divergences for large momenta ( equivalently , short distances ) . in renormalizable theories ,",
    "all divergences can be absorbed into the parameters of the theory .",
    "this procedure corresponds simply to a redefinition ( or a renormalization ) of the original parameters .",
    "however , this is not possible in the case of nonrenormalizable theories , where there are some divergences that can not be absorbed in any parameter of the lagrangian .",
    "we could simply add new operators in order to absorb such divergences .",
    "the problem is that required operators in general induce more and more divergences which in turn require more and more operators to absorb them .",
    "the process never stops .",
    "a remarkable feature of the wilson approach is that it deals with the uv divergences in a more natural way due to the process of separation of energy scales .",
    "the divergences are tamed by the cutoff @xmath19",
    ". if we are interested in low - energy physics , these ultraviolet effects are not important at all . in a certain sense , the wilson approach unifies our view of renormalizable and nonrenormalizable theories , unveiling the intrinsic effective nature in both cases .",
    "now that we have some basic ingredients of the renormalization group and effective field theories , we are ready to explore some interesting examples . we start by discussing some issues concerning lorentz invariance , where it is realized as an ir fixed point of the renormalization group .",
    "consider a theory with a single scalar field with a cubic self - interaction given by the lagrangian , @xmath50 latin indices @xmath51 assigned to coordinates run only over spatial dimensions while greek indices @xmath52 run over both space and time dimensions . as @xmath53=-1 $ ] in mass units , it is easy to check that @xmath54=(d-2)/2 $ ] and then @xmath55=(6-d)/2 $ ] , which shows that the model is renormalizable in @xmath56 spacetime dimensions .",
    "we want to study the renormalization group flow of the parameter @xmath57 , which is defined according to ( [ 2.6 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath58 , where @xmath5 is the mass scale introduced in the renormalization procedure",
    ". detailed expositions of the involved field theoretical calculations can be found in @xcite . by calculating the relevant correlation functions and using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we obtain @xmath59 .",
    "that is nothing else but the reflex of the lorentz symmetry of the model .",
    "the speed of light is not an effective parameter in the sense of the renormalization group .",
    "that is the reason we are free to choose the natural system of units or any another one .",
    "the renormalization group analysis is completely unnecessary .",
    "in fact , the lagrangian ( [ q1a ] ) just correspond to a units system where the speed of light is not equal one .",
    "of course , this does not violate the lorentz symmetry .",
    "the factor @xmath57 can be eliminated by means of a rescaling of the spatial coordinates .",
    "the situation is different when we have more than one single field in the theory since there is the possibility of assigning different coefficients for the terms involving the spatial derivatives . to be concrete ,",
    "consider the yukawa - type model in @xmath60 spacetime dimensions @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are dirac spinors and @xmath64 are the dirac matrices , with @xmath65 .",
    "contrarily to the previous case , it is no longer possible simultaneously to eliminate the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath66 by means of a rescaling of the spatial coordinates .",
    "hence , we have a true lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "in such situation the behavior of the effective parameters is nontrivial .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath67 , the renormalization group functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 vanish since it corresponds to the case of the lorentz invariant theory , i.e. , the lorentz symmetry manifests as a fixed point .",
    "the important question here is concerning the nature of that fixed point .    by calculation the green functions and using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we get @xmath70 and @xmath71 as expected , when @xmath67 ,",
    "we have @xmath72 . now let us analyze the situation where @xmath73 .",
    "there are two possibilities :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath74 . in this case",
    ", the function @xmath75 is monotonically increasing while @xmath76 monotonically decreasing , where @xmath77 is a logarithmic scale , @xmath78 , with @xmath79 corresponding to the initial configuration of the parameters .",
    "as we go to lower and lower energies , the parameters tend to a common value .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rg1 ] .    .",
    "@xmath80 is given by the dashed line while @xmath81 by the dotted line , with @xmath82 and @xmath79 ( @xmath83 ) being the scale corresponding to the initial configuration in the parameter space .",
    "the plot corresponds to the initial values @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . ]    \\2 .",
    "@xmath87 . here",
    "the behavior of the effective parameters is reversed .",
    "the function @xmath75 becomes monotonically decreasing while @xmath76 becomes monotonically increasing .",
    "again , as we go to lower and lower energies , they tend to a common value , as showed in fig .",
    "[ rg2 ] .    .",
    "the plot corresponds to the initial values @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath86 . ]",
    "these results show that no matter what is the initial configuration of the parameters , as we go to the low - energy sector of the theory we are approaching to the lorentz invariant situation , showing that the fixed point is an attractive one .",
    "see the diagram of flow in fig .",
    "[ rgflow ] .",
    "in other words , the lorentz symmetry is an inevitable consequence of the renormalization group as we go to the low - energy limit .     and",
    "there is a line of fixed points in @xmath67 . ]",
    "the modified lagrangian ( [ q2 ] ) , with two different parameters @xmath57 and @xmath66 , is a close relative of the relativistic lagrangian , obtained when @xmath67 .",
    "it corresponds to a kind of a soft deviation of the relativistic case .",
    "we say _ soft _ meaning that it just involves a deformation of the parameters of the relativistic case but the operator content of the theory is not changed .",
    "however , once we no longer have the lorentz symmetry , we could think in introducing new symmetry - breaking marginal or relevant operators like , @xmath90 , with @xmath91 a lorentz - violating constant vectors .",
    "this type of operator introduces a more drastic breaking of the lorentz symmetry , since it modifies the operator content of the theory .",
    "we call this a _ hard _ symmetry breaking .    for symmetries in general",
    ", we can formalize a bit more the definitions of soft and hard symmetry breaking as follows .",
    "consider a lagrangian of form ( [ 3.5 ] ) , that we rewrite here for convenience , @xmath92 this lagrangian is suppose to exhibit a certain set of symmetries , which means that there are specific conditions or relations between the parameters @xmath39 s , that can be written as @xmath93 we obtain a lagrangian with a soft breaking with @xmath94<d$ ] .",
    "] of symmetry by replacing the parameters @xmath39 by a set of deformed parameters , @xmath95 , that do not satisfy all relations in ( [ 5.2 ] ) , @xmath96 the other possibility is to introduce in the lagrangian new marginal and relevant operators which break some symmetries @xmath97 this is defined as a hard breaking of the symmetries .",
    "finally , we can have the situation where both symmetry - breaking possibilities occur at the same time , @xmath98 we say in this case that we have _ soft_+_hard _ symmetry breaking .",
    "after we give up some symmetry , the natural question is whether it can be reobtained or emerge in specific sectors of the theory , for example in low - energies . with this type of mechanism in mind we can think in interesting extensions of several physical models . in the case of soft symmetry breaking ,",
    "there are obvious fixed points , corresponding to the symmetric case with @xmath99 , as in the previous section .",
    "one important question in this case concerns the nature of the fixed points , i.e. , if they are attractive or repulsive . on the other hand , in the case of hard or even soft+hard",
    "the situation is very delicate since it may involve stringent fine - tuning .",
    "the existence of infrared fixed points is highly nontrivial in these cases . to make the above general discussion a bit more concrete we consider some examples in the following .",
    "we want to discuss some reasons for constructing theories with hard breaking of the lorentz symmetry as in ( [ 5.6 ] ) .",
    "the fundamental point is that the presence of higher spatial derivatives operators yield to an improvement of the ultraviolet behavior .",
    "hence the model turns out to be renormalizable even in 10 + 1 dimensions . of course",
    ", we could try to obtain the same gain without losing the lorentz symmetry by introducing the relativistic operator @xmath107 , with @xmath108 .",
    "the problem here is that this operator generally leads to a breakdown of the unitarity , which is a key property of a consistent quantum theory .",
    "this problem is directly related to the presence of higher time derivatives which essentially modifies the pole structure of the green functions leading ultimately to the violation of the cutting rules ( cutkosky ) required for unitarity @xcite .",
    "thus ( [ 5.6 ] ) is a natural way to get a theory with a better ultraviolet behavior without spoiling unitarity at the price of the lorentz symmetry , which is no longer a property of the full spectrum but could be restricted to an specific range of energy . after all , within the current experimental limitations , the constraints on lorentz - violating parameters are very strong @xcite .    with that understanding it is tempting to employ a similar procedure to the problem of quantization of gravitational interactions in the perturbative sense .",
    "we will discuss more about gravitation in sec .",
    "[ discrete ] , but for now the important point is that the einstein - hilbert action for the gravitational field is not perturbatively renormalizable in 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions . with the above procedure , we could obtain a power - counting renormalizable anisotropic quantum gravitational theory in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "there are not yet clear conclusions if this is a viable mechanism but it could at least furnish more insights on this formidable problem .    to conclude this section",
    ", it is instructive to use these ideas to exemplify the soft+hard breaking of lorentz symmetry in the yukawa model of sec .",
    "[ lorentz ] . this can be done just by adding the operators @xmath103 as well as @xmath109 to the lagrangian ( [ q2 ] ) .",
    "this induces the anisotropic scaling between space and time which shifts the renormalizability to 6 + 1 spacetime dimensions .",
    "renormalization group studies of this model indicate that it is hard to clearly identify a lorentz - invariant sector , although it can be reached after stringent fine - tuning of the involved parameters @xcite .",
    "the notion of soft breaking of symmetry can be used to investigate different types of symmetry .",
    "let us apply it to the case of supersymmetry by considering a soft - deformed version of the massless wess - zumino model discussed in @xcite , @xmath110 this lagrangian is invariant under supersymmetry transformations when @xmath111 .",
    "we will analyze the renormalization group flow of the couplings constants @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the new feature of the theory is that the ward identities resulting from supersymmetry are no longer valid .",
    "this implies , for example , that the well known canceling of logarithmic divergences of the interaction vertices and the quadratic divergences in the massive case will no longer take place .",
    "the corresponding @xmath11-functions are given by @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117 to make the nature of the fixed point more evident , it is convenient to introduce two parameters to measure the deviations from supersymmetry , @xmath118 the linearized @xmath11-functions for @xmath119 and @xmath120 are @xmath121 the positive signs show that the supersymmetric point @xmath122 is attractive in the infrared .",
    "thus the supersymmetry is a low - energy manifestation of the deformed model ( [ 5.9 ] ) .",
    "one of the most important and interesting example of an emergent symmetry is the scale invariance when a system undergoes a second order phase transition .",
    "as we shall discuss , this symmetry is responsible for the most striking properties of the critical points , such as the universality . by exploring the consequences of the scale invariance it is possible to extract a lot of useful information .",
    "different phases of a system can be characterized according to their symmetries ( or absence of them ) , giving rise to the idea of order classification .",
    "when the system undergoes a phase transition it changes its physical properties , i.e. , it changes the order . to characterize this process ,",
    "it is usual to introduce a quantity , called order parameter , with the following properties : in one of the phases it vanishes ( _ disordered _ phase ) , while it is nonzero in the other phase ( _ ordered _ phase ) .",
    "furthermore , it generally reflects the symmetry properties of the system .",
    "we are restricting our discussion to the case of continuous ( second order ) phase transitions . near the critical point",
    ", the order parameter is small , justifying an expansion of the free energy in powers of the order parameter , known as landau - ginzburg free energy ( see for example @xcite ) . of course",
    ", we are not going into the merit of how easy or hard it is to find an order parameter .",
    "the landau - ginzburg free energy provides a general description of the critical behavior for classes of systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase transitions occur in many different systems , with many different properties , each one with its own microscopic features .",
    "an immediate question is : what is the reason for considering a general theory for phase transitions ?",
    "the answer leads to the concept of the universality , that is the most special property of the critical phenomena , and it is ultimately related to the emergence of the scale invariance at the critical point .    in the neighborhood of the critical region",
    "some thermodynamics quantities , as the specific heat and the susceptibility , exhibit a peculiar behavior , with divergences that are governed by a set of critical exponents . in this sense ,",
    "the critical exponents describe the nature of the singularities and characterize the phase transition .",
    "all phase transitions with the same set of critical exponents belong to the same universality class .",
    "the most remarkable property is that the universality classes are determined by few factors , essentially the spatial dimension of the system and the involved symmetries .",
    "what is behind the universality is the fact that the correlation length is the only scale length of the theory at the critical point .",
    "away from the critical point , the correlation length is of the order of the typical microscopic length of the system , as the lattice spacing in the case of a solid .",
    "thus the microscopic properties are important and give rise to the specific characteristics of the material . however , in the neighborhood of the critical region , the correlation length becomes larger and larger , diverging at the critical point ( when it has the size of the system ) such that the microscopic properties become unimportant and the system scale invariant .",
    "this emergent symmetry can be exploited to restrict the correlation functions .",
    "close to the critical point , the correlation length @xmath136 behaves as @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the critical exponent of the correlation length and @xmath77 involves some parameter which measures the distance from the critical point . for example , in a phase transition driven by the temperature , it is usually choosen to be @xmath139 , with @xmath140 being the critical temperature . based in the scale invariance , the two - point correlation function of the order parameter is @xmath141 with @xmath142 being the critical exponent of the correlation function .",
    "note that away from the critical point , the correlation function exhibits an exponential decay , while it becomes a power law at the critical point ( @xmath143 ) , as required by the scale invariance .    according to sec.[softhard ] ,",
    "the mechanism of emergence of scale invariance generally occurs when the parameters associated to the hard symmetry - breaking operators , @xmath144 , vanish at the critical point .",
    "for example , in the case of temperature - driven phase transitions , @xmath145 .",
    "these operators are generally associated to the quadratic term in the order parameter of the landau - ginzburg expansion .",
    "one of the most important models of statistical mechanics is the ising model , described by the hamiltonian , @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 is an external field .",
    "as firstly obtained by onsager @xcite , the two dimensional case is exactly solvable in the absence of the external field and it exhibits an order - disorder continuous phase transition .",
    "that is a perfect example to test the methods of effective field theory as we can always compare its implications with those extracted from the exact solution .",
    "the basic question is : how can we obtain an effective field theory for the ising model at the critical point , where the continuum limit is legitimate ?",
    "the answer is conformal invariance .",
    "in fact , as it can be shown @xcite , under certain broad conditions , the scale invariance in two dimensions implies conformal invariance .",
    "there is no general proof of this statement in higher dimensions although there are no counterexamples .",
    "anyway , conformal invariance does not bring much more information than rigid scale invariance in three or higher dimensions .",
    "this is not the case of two dimensional systems , where the conformal invariance is strong enough , leading to severe restrictions on the operator content as well as on the correlation functions of the theory .",
    "we will explore the consequences of conformal symmetry .",
    "let us start by stressing some aspects of conformal symmetry important to our purposes .",
    "for a detailed exposition see the standard references @xcite .",
    "a conformal transformation `` preserves angles '' , i.e. , it is a coordinate transformation that leaves the metric invariant up to a scale factor , @xmath149 for an infinitesimal transformation , @xmath150 , under which the interval @xmath151 changes as @xmath152 the requirement that ( [ 7.2 ] ) is true leads to the following condition for the parameter @xmath153 , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the flat spacetime metric , with euclidean or minkowski signature .",
    "we will work in euclidean space .",
    "the solutions of this condition for @xmath156 give the transformations of the conformal group : @xmath157 all the above parameters are real . in the case of translations and special conformal transformations",
    "they are constant vectors , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",

    "the magnetic field enforces the electrons to describe circular orbits . along their motion , eventually they go around at each other producing quantum phases .",

    "a nice discussion on this is presented in @xcite .    to construct the low - energy effective field theory",
    "we will be based on some phenomenological observations .",
    "firstly , it is a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional phenomenon .",
    "the electrons are restricted to the surface of a two - dimensional surface .",
    "thus the existence of a conserved electric current , @xmath233 , enable us to introduce a vector @xmath234 as @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the completely antisymmetric symbol , such that the current is automatically conserved .",
    "note that the form ( [ 10.1 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath237 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary function .",

    "the first relevant term that we can imagine is the linear combination @xmath241 .",
    "it is immediately ruled out by gauge invariance .",
    "next we can try terms with one derivative .",
    "there are several possibilities , @xmath242 in addition to other terms that differ from the above ones by total derivatives .",
    "all these operators are marginal .",
    "we need to check for gauge invariance .",
    "the only possibility compatible with gauge invariance is the combination @xmath243 , involving the totally antisymmetric symbol @xmath244 .",
    "this yields to the chern - simons lagrangian @xmath245 where @xmath246 can be identified as the inverse of the filling fraction , @xmath247 .",
    "the dots represent irrelevant operators .",
    "the chern - simons is still consistent with the fact that an external magnetic field breaks both parity and time reversal .",
    "thus the resulting low - energy theory is a lorentz invariant one .",
    "this is an accidental symmetry since it is not one of the basic requirements .",
    "the gauge invariance in three dimensions implies lorentz invariance for an operator involving only a single derivative .",
    "this is not so for a maxwell - type term @xmath248 .",
    "although it is an irrelevant operator , as lorentz symmetry is not a basic assumption , we could expect to have a more general linear combination like @xmath249 , since @xmath250 and @xmath251 are independently gauge invariants .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the gauge field @xmath234 does not represent any physical quantity of the system .",
    "it is not related to the external magnetic field producing the hall effect .",
    "that information is indeed contained in @xmath246 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath234 is a kind of an emergent quantity reflecting some low - energy physical properties .",
    "it is remarkable that the chern - simons action captures much of the physics of the quantum hall system , assigning both fractional charge and statistics for the low - energy excitations , the fractional filling fraction and the existence of edge currents when we assume a physical boundary in the system .    as a last comment , it is worthy to mention that the chern - simons endow a deep invariance , the topological invariance",
    "this is so because the chern - simons action is independent of the metric of the manifold on which it is defined .",
    "this allowed a deep understanding of many properties of the quantum hall effect from the topological point of view .",
    "these topological aspects are ultimately responsible for a new chapter in the development of condensed matter associated to topological orders @xcite . for example , more recently it led to the theoretical prediction and experimental realization of the topological insulators @xcite .",
    "like the quantum hall state , the topological insulators represent a new quantum state of matter which is characterized by having a bulk band like an ordinary insulator , but have protected conducting states on their edges .",
    "one of the greatest problems of modern physics is how to construct a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity .",
    "when we try to apply the standard methods of perturbation theory to the gravitational interactions governed by the einstein - hilbert action @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the ricci scalar and @xmath254 is the newton s constant , we end up with a nonrenormalizable theory @xcite .",
    "it means that some uv divergences can not be absorbed into the parameters of the theory . of course , in view of the discussion in sec .",
    "[ eft ] this is not so bad if we are interested in the low - energy physics .",
    "a lot of useful information can be extracted by considering ( [ 11.1 ] ) as an effective field theory from the beginning @xcite .",
    "but we still could not be content and desire to understand in a more deep way the high - energy regimes of gravitational interactions , in particular the physical mechanisms and the degrees of freedom relevant in such scales .",
    "we have different paths to follow .",
    "if we insist that the action ( [ 11.1 ] ) correctly describes the quantum properties of gravitational interactions , we could imagine that the nonrenormalizability is an awkward effect of the perturbative method itself and once the theory is treated exactly the divergences would disappear . from the renormalization group perspective",
    "this requires the existence of a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point , acting as a kind of asymptotic protection to the theory .",
    "this proposal is due to weinberg and it is known as asymptotic safety @xcite .    once again , from the effective theory point of view , the action ( [ 11.1 ] ) is a low - energy manifestation . at the same time we are lead to imagine",
    "that a more complex structure , possibly involving completely new physics , can govern the short - distance structure of the spacetime .",
    "we want to discuss some proposals for that high - energy physics .",
    "one important hint comes from the problem of the strict localization in the presence of gravitational fields .",
    "the equation of motion of ( [ 11.1 ] ) reads @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the ricci tensor and @xmath174 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "if we try to localize a particle in the spacetime with precision @xmath257 , the heisenberg s uncertainty principle implies an indeterminacy in the energy - momentum of the order @xmath258 .",
    "as we improve the precision of the measurement , more energy - momentum is transmitted to the region of observation . according to ( [ 11.2 ] ) ,",
    "large contributions to the energy - momentum produce large gravitational fields .",
    "these fields could become so strong such that they prevent light or any other information to scape from the region of observation , leading to the conclusion that it is a meaningless try to define the strict localization .",
    "we could then imagine that the short - distance structure of the spacetime has an intrinsic discrete nature , with minimum pieces , which automatically eliminates the concept of points . in the sense of emergent properties",
    ", it suggests that the own concept of a continuum spacetime is a low - energy manifestation , i.e. , a kind of `` hydrodynamic '' approximation .",
    "of course , this will lead a breakdown of some familiar concepts as locality , unitarity and causality .",
    "but maybe all these concepts are just low - energy manifestations .",
    "see @xcite for an interesting discussion on emergent spacetime .",
    "a possible way to implement these ideas is through the so - called noncommutative theories @xcite .",

    ", the effect of noncommuting operators can be simulated in terms of commuting objects but with the ordinary product replaced by the moyal product , @xmath265 in this case , the basic commutation rule ( [ 11.3 ] ) reads @xmath266_{\\star}\\equiv x^{\\mu}\\star x^{\\nu}- x^{\\nu}\\star x^{\\mu }   = i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] .",
    "the presence of derivatives of arbitrary order makes the moyal product highly nonlocal .",
    "this can be more evident if we rewrite it as @xmath267 where @xmath268 , since it involves the product of fields at different spacetime points .",
    "integration of ( [ 11.6 ] ) reveals an important property of the moyal product , @xmath269 which makes it easy to be implemented in field theories .",
    "we just need to introduce the moyal product in the interaction terms .",
    "the quadratic parts will not be affected and it is simple to obtain the feynman rules .",
    "noncommutativity shows up as the presence of trigonometric factors in the vertices , depending on momenta .     theory . ]",
    "we will not go on gravitational theories .",
    "it is more instructive to illustrate some basic effects of noncommutativity in simpler field theories .",
    "for example , in a scalar theory with an interaction @xmath270 , the one - loop contribution to the two - point function shown in fig .",
    "[ tp ] is @xmath271 the oscillatory factor makes the integral convergent in the uv , but now depending on the external momentum . for small momenta , it behaves as @xmath272 . when inserted into larger diagrams it will potentially lead to ir divergences that can compromise the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "this is the so - called uv / ir mixing @xcite .",
    "the physics of this type of theory seems to be irreconcilable with the decoupling of scales discussed in sec .",
    "[ int ] . in general",
    ", the usual insensivity of the ir regime to the uv does not hold in noncommutative theories @xcite .    at first sight ,",
    "the assumption of a discrete microscopic spacetime is tempting since it immediately evades the severe singularities coming from interactions at coincident points .",
    "however , as we discussed , it leads to a breakdown of some basic notions as locality and unitarity .",
    "another way to alleviate the problems with divergences , while preserving the continuum character of spacetime , is by considering the fundamental entities as extended objects like strings , membranes etc , instead of point - like particles .",
    "thus the interactions between such objects take place at _ finite regions _ of spacetime rather than at coincident points .",
    "it gives the idea that the divergences can become smoother .",
    "strings are somewhat special among the possibilities @xcite .",
    "this is so because higher dimensional objects than strings possess so many internal degrees of freedom , corresponding to different configurations they can assume . in a quantized theory , where it is necessary to sum over all possible configurations , these many degrees of freedom can yield to internal divergences .",
    "the strings are the only extended objects where both spacetime and internal divergences are under control @xcite . in this picture , the particles are interpreted as different vibrations of a string .",
    "the higher is the excited state bigger is the mass of the corresponding particle . at low energies we expect that the length of the strings can be neglected recovering the usual particle description .",
    "while the string physical picture is simple , the consequences are rather surprising .",
    "it reveals new ingredients for the microscopic structure of spacetime .",
    "string theory has come a long way until to be recognized as a potential candidate for a theory involving quantum gravity in addition other interactions but nowadays it is the most popular candidate to describe the physics at extreme high - energy regimes in a unified and fundamental way .",
    "a basic feature of string description is that the spacetime dimension @xmath18 where the strings live is not arbitrary .",
    "it is fixed by internal consistency of the theory .",
    "in fact , it shows up in a number of ways , but essentially it is related to the requirement that some of classical symmetries remain true in the quantized theory . for the bosonic string @xmath273 while for superstring @xmath274 . in any of the cases ,",
    "the point is that the theory shows that the microscopic spacetime dimension can be different from our four dimensional spacetime at low energies .",
    "it leads to the idea that the own dimension is an effective concept .",
    "once it is assumed that the own spacetime and its dimensionality can be viewed as emergent concepts , we have more possible theoretical aspects to consider , enlarging the present framework and feeding the source of ideas to approach this formidable problem .",
    "symmetries are among the most important concepts of physics and constitute an indispensable ingredient in the construction and development of all physical theories .",
    "we can separate them in two big groups .",
    "a symmetry is said fundamental when it holds true in the whole spectrum of the system whereas emergent symmetries appear only in specific sectors after some coarse - graining .",
    "along these notes we have collected several examples which exhibit emergent symmetries .",
    "this phenomenon is ubiquitous in the nature and constitutes a viable mechanism to the realization of symmetries .",
    "the main goal is to illustrate it from different perspectives and discuss some features that can be used in more general contexts .",
    "the key point is that we can take advantage of the emergent symmetries to acquire physical information even in very complex problems .",
    "effective field theories and the renormalization group are powerful methods to describe the physics and the underlying symmetries in determined scale .    given a field theory respecting a set of symmetries",
    ", we can construct an akin theory violating one or more of them , which is built up from deformations of the original model .",
    "the deformations can be soft or hard , if they involve modifications of the parameters or of the operator content , respectively .",
    "they can also occur simultaneously , where we say that the breaking is soft+hard .",
    "the idea is that if a symmetry is emergent , it is natural looking for theories with deviations of it .",
    "the challenge is to recover it in specific limits of more general theories .",
    "once we no longer have the constraints from symmetries we have more freedom to write down lagrangians .",
    "we studied examples of lorentz , gauge and supersymmetric violating theories , but the idea can be straightforwardly extended to other symmetries .",
    "special attention was given to the case of scale and conformal invariance since they are paradigmatic examples of emergent symmetries at critical points .",
    "they are responsible for the most striking features of critical phenomena , such as the universality . in two dimensions ,",
    "the scale invariance is enhanced by conformal invariance which turns out to be extremely powerful in providing physical information about the critical behavior .",
    "we discussed also some surprising emergent symmetries referred as accidental .",
    "they appear as result of coincident arrangement of the degrees of freedom or properties of the system .",
    "the fact is that this realization of symmetries usually reveals interesting aspects .",
    "for example , while there is an intensive experimental search for supersymmetry in the accelerators , unsuccessfully so far , it can be realized in many - body problems of condensed matter and statistical physics @xcite .",
    "an important accidental symmetry that was not discussed in the body of the manuscript is the lorentz invariance arising in the continuum limit of certain spin models .",
    "for example , the effective action obtained for the two - dimensional ising model , eq .",
    "( [ 7.18 ] ) , can be written in a manifestly relativistic form as @xmath275 .",
    "this is a common feature of some spin systems involving interactions between first - neighbors .",
    "a classical example is an antiferromagnetic spin chain , where the low - energy excitations , with the dispersion relation like @xmath276 , are described by a relativistic nonlinear sigma model ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "other example is the continuum limit of quantum spherical spins models , given by the large-@xmath277 limit of relativistic nonlinear sigma models @xcite .",
    "the main point we want to emphasize is that the idea of emergent symmetries can be useful to explore deep questions , such as concerning the microscopic structure of the spacetime and its constituents . to give an example in this direction",
    ", we mention the so - called string - net condensation theory due to wen @xcite .",
    "it gathers some features from spin models , lattice gauge theories and superstrings .",
    "the rich interplay of subjects yield to some interesting physics .",
    "in particular , particles which are usually believed to be fundamental , as electrons and photons , can emerge from the string - net picture as excitations above the ground state corresponding to certain quantum orders in local bosonic models .",
    "finally , the study of emergent symmetries , and more generally emergent phenomena , is a good opportunity to bring together different parts of physics , which provides a fruitful exchange .",
    "techniques and concepts coming from one area can find applications in different context generating a confluence of ideas .",
    "with a consistent combination of ingredients , greater are the chances to reach a more accurate description of the nature .",
