    "it is very well known that poisson s equation is among the most important equations in electromagnetic theory .",

    "for the restricted case of static charges and fields in vacuum , the appropiate boundary conditions for the electric potential are @xcite @xmath4 on the other hand , the standard boundary conditions for the wave function @xmath5 in one dimensional quantum mechanics are : @xcite @xmath6 in particular , if there is a delta function potential at @xmath7 , then the change of slope of the wave function , @xmath8 , at the point @xmath7 is proportional to the amplitude of the delta function as well as the wave function @xmath9 at this point.@xcite this is the type of boundary conditions we expect for the electrostatic potential . as a consequence , the electrostatic potential and the one dimensional wave function share the same boundary conditions for a delta function potential",

    "its existence and stability has been tested for the effects of different boundary conditions@xcite and symmetry - breaking perturbations.@xcite + in this article , a mapping between a three dimensional electrostatic problem described by poisson s equation and the one dimensional schrndinger equation is given through a simple transformation .",
    "this relation will allow us to find the wave function and energy of the ground state of the quantum system by using electrostatic results .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows .",
    "first we will start by transforming the poisson equation into a schrdinger - like equation , and discuss when both equations are equivalent",

    "the conclusions are summarized in the last section .",

    "we know from basic electrodynamic courses that the only charge distribution to produce uniform electrostatic fields are infinite charge sheets .",
    "since the infinite charge sheet has plane symmetry , the electrostatic potential depends on one variable only , i.e. @xmath22 . for this case",
    "( [ eq02a ] ) is given by @xmath23 making the following substitutions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary length and @xmath26 is the asymptotic magnitude of the electric field , i.e. @xmath27 , we obtain the time independent schrdinger equation @xmath28 for the case of bound states , i.e. @xmath29.@xcite this relationship means that the wave function and the bound state energy will be given in terms of the electric potential and the energy density by @xmath30 where @xmath16 is the normalization constant and @xmath31 is the energy density , respectively .",

    "we know from basic electrodynamic courses that the only charge distribution to produce a uniform electrostatic field are an odd number of parallel infinite sheets with opposite electric charge densities @xmath32 @xcite , hence we will consider a volume charge density given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dirac delta function at the position @xmath35.@xcite let us consider the case when @xmath36 , for this case the volume charge distribution is of the form @xmath37 where we have taken @xmath38 .",
    "the electric field caused by an infinite sheet of charge density @xmath39 at any space point is @xcite @xmath40 therefore , the electric potential and the energy density are given by @xcite @xmath41 using equation ( [ eq04a ] ) we obtain the wave function and the energy of the bound state @xmath42 the wave function given by equation ( [ eq09 ] ) can be normalized only for @xmath43 , otherwise it blows up when @xmath44 . using equation ( [ eq03 ] ) we get the potential energy function @xmath10 for the quantum mechanical case , where @xmath45 is the strength of the potential . making the appropiate substitutions into equation ( [ eq09 ] ) we get the corresponding bound state solution in the presence of an atractive delta function potential @xmath46 where the normalization constant is @xmath47.@xcite using the wave function given in equation ( [ eq10 ] ) it is easy to obtain the expectation values for the potential energy @xmath48 and kinetic energy @xmath49 , respectively .",
