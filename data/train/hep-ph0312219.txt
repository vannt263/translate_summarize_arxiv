    "recent progress in experimental neutrino physics has been nothing short of breathtaking . at the time of this writing ,",
    "only five years have elapsed since super - kamiokande s observation  @xcite of the atmospheric neutrino deficit .",
    "just last year the sno experiment showed  @xcite through detection of neutral current events that the solar neutrino deficit , as observed by decades of steadily improving charged current experiments ( homestake  @xcite , kamiokande  @xcite , sage  @xcite , gallex  @xcite , gno  @xcite , super - kamiokande  @xcite , and sno itself  @xcite ) is truly a deficit due to solar @xmath2 s oscillating into other active flavors . in the past year the k2k experiment  @xcite confirmed nicely the atmospheric mixing parameters measured by ref .",
    "@xcite using long - baseline accelerator techniques , while the kamland reactor experiment  @xcite tightly constrained the mixing parameter space previously probed only through solar neutrino measurements , and the wmap satellite experiment  @xcite used cosmological constraints to bound the neutrino mass sum to lie below @xmath3  ev ( at 95% cl ) .",
    "this list does not do justice to the large number of completed neutrino experiments that provide important exclusionary bounds , nor the panoply of new experiments underway or in the planning stages .",
    "our intent is merely to provide a snapshot of a rapidly maturing field , and to point out that , even now , we possess a reasonably good picture of neutrino masses and mixing as encapsulated by the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix . according to a recent three - flavor analysis  @xcite , the parameters with 2@xmath4 uncertainties are given by @xmath5 where the magnitude symbols on @xmath6 serve as a reminder that either the normal or inverted hierarchy is still allowed .",
    "the important point here is not the precise values of the observables ( which seem to improve monthly in response to new data regularly being released ) , but rather the picture painted by their magnitudes : all neutrino masses are small , their mass differences are smaller still and hierarchical , and precisely two of the three euler angles in the mns matrix are large ( `` bimaximal '' ) , while the third is quite small ( a result of including the chooz  @xcite and palo verde  @xcite exclusionary data in the global analysis ) .",
    "this structure differs radically from that found in the quark sector , where the ckm matrix possesses three small and hierarchically decreasing euler angles ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is natural to suppose that the existence of three complete flavors ( generations ) of spin-@xmath8 fermions , with members possessing the same quantum numbers under all standard model gauge groups and differing only in mass , suggests some sort of flavor symmetry .",
    "this is , after all , how the periodic table of the elements and the quark structure of hadrons came to be understood . in the case of an ostensible flavor symmetry ,",
    "however , one must incorporate a number of disparate properties : masses extend from @xmath9  gev , near the weak scale , through those of a number of light quarks and charged leptons in the mev to gev range , down to the neutrinos , with masses ( perhaps ) in the mev range .",
    "a flavor symmetry must also accommodate the aforementioned differences between the ckm and mns matrices .",
    "finally , if the flavor symmetry leaves a signature detectable at weak scales ( such as in the context of supersymmetry ) , it must avoid creating unacceptably large flavor - changing neutral currents .    in the case of the neutrinos",
    ", the seesaw mechanism provides a natural machinery for obtaining tiny mass eigenvalues , and in the following we employ the mechanism in its simplest form .",
    "of course , the seesaw also requires neutrinos with a majorana character , and the presence of majorana in addition to yukawa ( dirac ) mass matrices both complicates and enriches the possible theory parameter space . for our current purposes , however , we are interested foremost in the general nature of the ( derived ) left - handed majorana mass matrix as well as those of the yukawa and right - handed majorana matrices that generate it , but less so in their fundamental origins .",
    "although the construction of a model to describe the origin of neutrino couplings is theoretically important , one must consider the low - energy phenomenological consequences of the model first in order to understand its limitations .",
    "the emerging precision of findings such as those in eqs .",
    "( [ deltam32])([theta13 ] ) , based on data only a few months old , suggests that we are rapidly approaching a `` tipping point '' at which exceptionally few yukawa and majorana matrix textures , and consequently a rarified set of possible flavor symmetries , will remain viable .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore constraints on natural textures that simultaneously give rise to bimaximal atmospheric ( @xmath10 ) and solar ( @xmath11 ) angles , while maintaining a small @xmath12 and a mass splitting hierarchy @xmath13 .",
    "we show , using only naturalness criteria such as the assumption that the small value of @xmath12 is not due to a fortuitous cancellation between charged lepton yukawa and neutrino majorana parameters , that there is an effective lower bound on the natural size of @xmath12 values arising from flavor models that predict the elements of the majorana and yukawa matrices . in particular , @xmath12 can not be much smaller than its currently measured bound , unless one resorts to fine tuning in either or both of the yukawa and majorana matrices .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite , in the same spirit of studying mass matrix textures , also finds that @xmath12 should lie close to its current bound ; however , ref .",
    "@xcite places emphasis on texture zeroes instead of ( as here ) the naturalness constraints of allowing matrix elements to be as large as possible .",
    "we note that the prediction that @xmath12 is not expected to be excessively small has been made in several previous works  @xcite , in the context of various models and parametrizations",
    ". moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite studies this issue by examining classes of models appearing in the literature and finds a similar effect . in this paper",
    "we derive and explain a simple underlying reason for this recurring result .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ conv ] we establish the conventions defining the relevant matrices . in sec .",
    "[ conts ] we lay out the naturalness criteria used to study yukawa and majorana textures and see how they are realized in a sample model .",
    "section  [ build ] presents a constructive method of building the left - handed neutrino majorana matrix that satisfies all existing data , at which point we observe how little effect a sufficiently small @xmath12 would have on the textures .",
    "sections  [ nh ] and [ ih ] explore the consequences of these constraints for the textures of the heavy right - handed neutrinos entering the seesaw mechanism in the normal and inverted hierarchies , respectively . section  [ concl ] concludes .",
    "the conventions defining the charged lepton yukawa matrix @xmath14 , the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath15 , and the neutrino majorana mass matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 are established simply by presenting the relevant lagrangian terms .",
    "what follows is of course well known , but is included in order to leave no ambiguities in the notation used in the rest of the paper .",
    "beginning with the neutrino terms , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the field obtained via the charge conjugation operation @xmath20 , h.c .",
    "= hermitian conjugate , and the fields @xmath21 stand for spinors containing all three neutrino generations , one first notes that the presence of a transposed ( rather than hermitian - conjugated ) field in the ket of majorana terms constrains @xmath16 and @xmath17 both to be ( complex ) symmetric matrices . in the most minimal seesaw mechanism , @xmath16 does not enter as a fundamental field in the lagrangian , but rather arises as an effective operator : @xmath22 as discussed in the introduction , in this work we begin by treating the effective @xmath16 precisely as one would any fundamental lagrangian parameter .",
    "the lagrangian in the lepton sector is then defined by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the usual electroweak gauge coupling and @xmath25  gev .",
    "we diagonalize @xmath14 in the usual way , with a biunitary transformation given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is diagonal .",
    "that is , the mass basis is related to the weak interaction basis by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is obtained by diagonalizing @xmath31 : @xmath32 while @xmath33 may be obtained by diagonalizing @xmath34 .    since the most general majorana mass matrix @xmath16 is complex symmetric rather than hermitian , the usual procedure of diagonalization via a unitary matrix composed of its eigenvectors is no longer entirely valid .",
    "nevertheless , one can prove  @xcite that for any such @xmath16 there exists a unitary matrix @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is diagonal ( in mathematical jargon , `` is reduced to normal form '' ) , and @xmath37 .",
    "the kinetic and mass terms are unaffected by these transformations , and the interaction term becomes @xmath38 from which one defines the mns matrix as @xmath39 the full mns matrix provides the linear combination of freely propagating neutrino mass eigenstates that interacts at a weak vertex with a particular charged lepton mass eigenstate .",
    "for example , eqs .",
    "( [ weakmass ] ) and ( [ mns ] ) show that an electron is produced from the `` isolated '' neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath40 with an amplitude given by ( dropping the mns subscript ) the now - famous matrix element @xmath41 .",
    "although the construction of @xmath42 closely resembles that of the ckm matrix , the majorana nature of the neutrinos permits two additional observable phases . using abbreviations @xmath43 and @xmath44 , one convenient parametrization  @xcite for @xmath42 reads @xmath45 the two cp - violating parameters @xmath46 represent relative phases between the neutrino mass eigenstates and can be removed from @xmath42 in eqs .",
    "( [ weakmass])([mns ] ) ; they do not contribute to neutrino oscillation measurements  @xcite , leaving @xmath47 as the sole cp - violating parameter discernable in such data .",
    "however , the majorana mass term is not invariant under such a redefinition of phases , meaning that only experiments sensitive to the majorana nature of neutrinos , such as neutrinoless double beta decay , can probe @xmath46 .",
    "notably , the conventions are chosen so that the phase @xmath47 multiplies the smallest euler angle @xmath12 , thus minimizing its impact in the texture .",
    "as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ mns ] ) , the mns matrix receives contributions from both the unitary matrix @xmath30 that diagonalizes the charged lepton yukawa matrix combination @xmath31 and the unitary matrix @xmath35 that puts the neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath16 into normal form . in general",
    ", both matrices can contribute equally to the observed mixing angles .",
    "however , as we argue in this section , such a democratic structure leads to either phenomenological or theoretical problems if one supposes that a natural flavor symmetry underlies these textures . to be specific",
    ", it does not appear possible to satisfy simultaneously the following criteria :    1 .",
    "the yukawa matrices of all light fermions  at least the charged ones  share a common origin in some flavor symmetry .",
    "hierarchies of charged fermion masses and quark mixing angles have a common origin , arising through the presence of small flavor symmetry - breaking parameters occupying certain elements of the yukawa matrices .",
    "3 .   there are no excessive fine - tuning cancellations between elements of @xmath30 and @xmath35 in forming @xmath42 ( or the unitary matrices that diagonalize the two left - handed quark yukawa matrices and that comprise the ckm matrix ) .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is very small ( in a sense made explicit below ) .",
    "point  ( 1 ) is the assertion that the texture of the yukawa matrix @xmath14 is the same as those of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the quark sector : corresponding elements of @xmath14 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 differ numerically , of course , but have the same order of magnitude .",
    "such a pattern occurs very naturally in grand unified theories .",
    "if this assumption fails , then the basic assumption that a flavor symmetry connects all fermions in a given generation falls into doubt .",
    "point  ( 2 ) asserts that the observed hierarchies , such as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , implies that [ by point  ( 3 ) ] the separate unitary matrices that diagonalize the quark yukawa matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are each only perturbatively different from being diagonal in the same basis .",
    "this , in turn , implies that @xmath54 and @xmath53 are each only perturbatively different from being diagonal themselves   and @xmath53 are both diagonal .",
    "if one considers only the low - energy theory , it is always possible to rotate into this basis ; however , for a given high - energy theory this freedom is lost since it may have its own preferred basis for yukawa couplings , and the unitary matrix connecting the two bases can contain interesting information .",
    "see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . by the same reasoning",
    ", it would also be unnatural for a yukawa combination such as @xmath52 to be nearly diagonal and yet for @xmath48 itself to have large off - diagonal elements .",
    "the notion that the quark yukawa matrices themselves differ only perturbatively from being diagonal matrices is a feature common to virtually all flavor models .",
    "indeed , perhaps the prettiest prediction of flavor models ( and its oldest  @xcite ) is the relation @xmath55 , which is obtained by supposing that the upper @xmath56 block of @xmath49 assumes the basic form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a small flavor symmetry - breaking parameter , leading to a ratio of @xmath59 to @xmath60 eigenvalues in the phenomenologically correct proportion @xmath61 .",
    "the relation of ckm and quark mass parameters is , of course , an example of point  ( 2 ) .",
    "point  ( 1 ) then suggests that the same basic texture applies to @xmath14 : no large mixing angles should arise in @xmath14 .",
    "the observed @xmath62 atmospheric and solar mixing angles [ eqs .",
    "( [ atmmix ] ) and ( [ solmix ] ) , respectively ] , combined with eq .",
    "( [ mns ] ) , implies that all large mixing angles must arise solely from @xmath35 .",
    "while it is then tempting to suppose that the texture of @xmath42 is determined entirely by @xmath35 , there is still the matter of the small element @xmath41 , to which we next turn .    in order to distinguish contributions to @xmath41 from the charged lepton and neutrino sectors",
    ", one may adopt a separate parametrization for each of @xmath30 and @xmath35 ( for which each angle is labeled with an @xmath63 or @xmath64 superscript , respectively ) analogous to that of the full @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ mnsparam ] ) .",
    "then , up to first order in the small angles @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , a straightforward calculation gives @xmath69 \\",
    ", e^{-i\\beta_1^e } .\\ ] ] an analogous expression using different phase conventions appears in ref .",
    "regardless of the specific form , however , the important point is that @xmath1 is generically as large as the largest of @xmath68 , @xmath66 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the phenomenological fact from eq .",
    "( [ theta13 ] ) that @xmath70 provides additional evidence that at least two of the charged lepton mixing angles , @xmath66 and @xmath65 , are small .",
    "even so , from this reasoning we see that @xmath41 may receive important contributions from @xmath14 . if one takes point  ( 1 ) at face value , and supposes that the reasoning leading to eq .",
    "( [ 12entry ] ) applies to @xmath14 , then point  ( 3 ) demands that @xmath1 must be at least @xmath71 , since the @xmath71 element @xmath72 induces through the diagonalization process an @xmath71 element @xmath73 , which implies that @xmath74 , and thus by eq .",
    "( [ ue3exp ] ) , @xmath1 is generically at least @xmath71 .",
    "one concludes that the current upper bound eq .",
    "( [ theta13 ] ) for @xmath75 , which is about @xmath76 , can not greatly exceed its actual value , for then point  ( 4 ) would be violated .",
    "one might now argue that the assumptions of points  ( 1)(3 ) are perhaps too restrictive ; after all , perhaps there is a mild tuning of the @xmath62 coefficients in the yukawa matrices that leads to a somewhat smaller @xmath73 element , and hence a smaller @xmath65 . or ,",
    "perhaps there exist other natural yukawa textures in the quark sector that do not use the mechanism of eq .",
    "( [ 12entry ] ) . indeed , for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "let us suppose that there exist some means by which one can render the contributions of @xmath14 to @xmath41 at most of the order of contributions from @xmath35 . in that case then , at least in terms of orders of magnitude , we are making the assumption @xmath77 our goal in the remainder of this paper is to show that , even in this scenario , obtaining a value for for @xmath78 as small as @xmath76 is unnatural .",
    "specifically , for a model that predicts elements of @xmath16 ( or equivalently @xmath15 and @xmath17 ) to produce @xmath79 requires a degree of fine tuning beyond the leading @xmath80 orders of the matrix elements .      in order to see how this plays out in a full - fledged flavor model ,",
    "we first introduce a bit of notation useful in discussing the problem .",
    "let us begin by introducing a single universal small parameter @xmath81 to describe flavor symmetry breaking . in typical models , the assumed flavor group @xmath82 with ultraviolet cutoff @xmath83 exhibits a sequential symmetry - breaking pattern to subgroups @xmath84 , @xmath85 where the integers @xmath86 label sequential scales of symmetry breaking , @xmath87 .",
    "models with multiple scales can then be represented by identifying the integers @xmath88 most closely associated with the order of magnitude appropriate to each step of symmetry breaking .",
    "models based on @xmath89 = u(2 )  @xcite and its discrete subgroup @xmath90  @xcite exhibit two steps of symmetry breaking , with associated dimensionless parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "equivalently , one may take @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 : @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the charged lepton yukawa texture for these models is @xmath98 the unitary matrix @xmath30 that diagonalizes @xmath31 [ eq .",
    "( [ clt2 ] ) ] is given by @xmath99 where only the leading - order contribution is retained in each element .",
    "the charged leptonic mass texture is given by @xmath100 which agrees well with the observed hierarchy @xmath101 .",
    "however , from eqs .",
    "( [ mns ] ) , ( [ mnsparam ] ) , and ( [ lm1 ] ) , the element crucial to @xmath41 , namely @xmath73 , is @xmath102 .",
    "thus , @xmath103 and the parameter @xmath80 previously used are of the same order of magnitude ( henceforth we use only @xmath103 ) , and the problem of a large contribution from @xmath14 to @xmath41 is manifested .",
    "for example , in the model of ref .",

    "( [ lhnm ] ) : @xmath104 a calculation much in the spirit of ref .  @xcite . if one assumes the seesaw mechanism eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) , then the absolute scale of neutrino masses is determined in part by high - energy scale of @xmath17 ; in this work , however , we are interested only in ratios of neutrino masses . using eqs .",
    "( [ deltam32 ] ) and ( [ deltam21 ] ) , the key neutrino mass observable to accommodate is therefore @xmath105 this ratio has two well - known realizations , the normal ( @xmath106 ) and inverted ( @xmath107 ) hierarchies .",
    "one must also ask how far the lightest neutrino mass @xmath108 lies above zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether it vanishes as some power of @xmath103 . factoring out the largest neutrino mass as an overall scale , the possible normal hierarchy solutions to eq .",

    "( [ invelts ] ) , in which @xmath145 appears only in combination with the second - order mass difference @xmath220 .",

    "although the most natural picture of flavor breaking predicts an @xmath130 contribution to @xmath41 arising from diagonalization of the charged lepton yukawa matrix @xmath14 , we first supposed that such a contribution is somehow suppressed .",

    "similar to those typically used for the charged fermions .",
    "next , we employed the simple seesaw mechanism to derive textures for the right - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath17 , and asked whether a texture of the _ generic _ form thus derived  without excessive correlation of its subleading terms  naturally gives rise to observables at the desired orders of magnitude . in all cases",
    ", we found that @xmath147 values of @xmath1 do not arise naturally , in the sense of the criteria laid out in sec .",
    "[ conts ] .",
