    "careful examination of the system in preparation for the _ new horizons _ mission has led to the discovery of four additional small moons , nix , hydra @xcite , styx , and kerberos @xcite .",
    "the moons are in mean motion resonances with charon @xcite , which could imply that they formed by accretion of debris after the charon - forming impact or were captured @xcite .",
    "the pluto / charon system is unique among major bodies in the solar system because it has reached the endpoint of its dynamical evolution : the so - called `` dual synchronous '' state in which charon s orbital period , spin period , and pluto s rotation period are equal ; charon currently orbits pluto at @xmath1 , where @xmath2 km is pluto s radius @xcite .",
    "as the orbit evolved to its present state and pluto s spin rate changed to match charon s orbital period , changes in the equilibrium tidal and rotational figures of the two bodies may have left their mark as systems of tectonic features on the surfaces of each body . orbit and spin evolution of the pluto",
    "/ charon system is driven by the raising and lowering of tidal bulges on each body .",
    "the tidal bulges exert torques which change the semi - major axes of the orbits and the spin rates . the mechanical energy associated with the periodic raising and lowering of the bulges",
    "is dissipated as heat in the bodies interiors .",
    "changes in bulge height and energy dissipation are thought to drive endogenic resurfacing and tectonic activity on many of the icy satellites of the outer solar system ( see , e.g. , @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "the magnitude of stresses arising from tidal evolution depends on the interior structures of the bodies and the frequency of tidal flexing ; the frequencies in turn depend on the pluto / charon distance and the spin periods .",
    "the main source of stress accumulation in the pluto / charon system would be figure changes associated with transfer of momentum from pluto s spin to charon s orbit . if the stresses exerted on the surfaces of the bodies exceed the nominal yield stress of ice , we consider that tectonic activity may have occurred .",

    "it is also higher than the @xmath43 mpa tensile strength of polycrystalline water ice at temperatures found in the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "this suggests that stresses from figure change may be sufficient to fracture pluto s surface and create tectonic features @xcite that could be observable by _ new horizons_.",
    "here , we estimate the time scale of orbital evolution from the synchronous to dual - synchronous state as a function of the interior viscosity of pluto for three different interior states : a differentiated pluto with an ocean , a differentiated pluto without an ocean , and an undifferentiated pluto ( see figure [ fig : interiors ] ) . we derive a time estimate by integrating the constant-@xmath11 approximation in equation ( [ eq : approximate_tevol ] ) for small steps in the pluto - charon distance , varying @xmath11 as a function of distance .",

    "not much is known about the interior state of pluto before the charon - forming impact .",
    "much of the prior work on pluto s interior assumes that it differentiated during its formation and early history @xcite .",
    "however , simulations of the charon - forming impact show that the proper mass , composition , and angular momentum for the system is most readily obtained when pluto and the charon - forming impactor are only partially differentiated @xcite .    here , we consider both cases as a possibility , but we favor differentiated plutos . the gravitational binding energy associated with assembling pluto , @xmath50 j / kg ( where @xmath51 is pluto s mass ) is larger than the latent heat of water ice , @xmath52 j / kg , suggesting that pluto s ice could melt during its accretion if 100% of its accretional energy were retained as heat",
    ". this may not be the case , especially if pluto formed slowly , and from low - velocity impacts ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if pluto formed very early in solar system history , before the dissipation of the solar nebula ( @xmath53 myr ) , comparable to the lifetime of disks around other stars @xcite , it may have been heated by the short - lived radioisotopes ( slri ) @xmath54al and @xmath55fe , which have half - lives less than @xmath56 myr and are present in greater abundances than u , th , and k @xcite .",
    "slri are particularly efficient at driving differentiation because they release heat on a time scale much shorter than the time scale for diffusive or convective heat transport in pluto s interior .",
    "removing a heat pulse from short - lived radioisotope decay across the outer @xmath57 km of pluto s interior would require @xmath58 gyr , where @xmath59 m@xmath60/s is the thermal diffusivity of water ice .",

    "j / kg , is larger than the latent heat of water ice .",
    "we also consider it likely that pluto had an ocean post - impact , and that the ocean may persist even to the present day .",
    "assuming an equilibrium between present chondritic heat flow and the convective heat flux , pluto could be warm enough to harbor an ocean beneath @xmath75 km of ice @xcite .",
    "variations in ice shell thickness can lead to stresses that differ by a factor of @xmath43 from estimates here .",
    "however , we seek estimates of stress at an order of magnitude level , so we do not explore the effect of shell thickness variations here .",
    "thicker oceans are possible in the past , when the chondritic heat flux was higher , and if some kind of low - eutectic material ( such as ammonia ) is mixed in with pluto s ices @xcite .",
    "of course , as charon s orbital evolution results in tidal heating inside pluto , the combination of impact induced heat , radiogenic heat , and tidal heat is likely to drive melting , which creates an ocean and could trigger runaway differentiation if pluto were undifferentiated before .",
    "although these simple arguments favor a differentiated pluto with an ocean , we additionally explore cases for pluto evolving with no ocean , and with a uniform - density interior , because they are both permitted by the impact simulations @xcite .",
    "as described in section [ sec : background ] , the orbital evolution time scale for the system is strongly dependent on the @xmath11 of pluto , which expresses the fraction of orbital energy dissipated during each diurnal tidal cycle .",
    "previous studies have considered @xmath76 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a value commonly assumed for icy satellites @xcite .",
    "models of the tidal deformation of europa and enceladus @xcite show that the values of @xmath77 and @xmath11 for a mixed ice / rock body depend on the degree of differentiation and whether the object has an ocean decoupling its outer ice shell from its deeper interior .",
    "thus , the time scale for system evolution and the potential for generating tidally induced tectonics on pluto depend strongly on its post - impact interior structure .",

    "the response of a spherically symmetric viscoelastic planet to an applied tidal potential with varying harmonic degree is calculated as a function of the tidal frequency and material properties of the planet .    for a viscoelastic body ,",
    "@xmath77 can be considered a complex number ( which we denote @xmath79 ) , where the real part of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , is related to elastic ( recoverable , adiabatic ) deformation occurring over a time scale @xmath81 , and the imaginary part , @xmath82 , is related to the non - recoverable dissipation occurring inside pluto over the tidal time scale @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : no_ocean]a illustrates the time scale for charon to evolve from the synchronous to dual synchronous state , for the case where pluto does not initially have an ocean ( interior state depicted in figure [ fig : interiors]b ) .",
    "the time scale for evolution is a strong function of the viscosity of the ice shell and ranges from @xmath168 years to much longer than @xmath169 gyr , the age of the solar system .",
    "( orbital evolution timescales longer than the age of the solar system are obviously not tenable , and so are represented as a gray shade on figure [ fig : no_ocean ] and subsequent figures ) .",
    "the evolution times for this interior model are extremely long because pluto s ice shell is rigidly coupled to its rock core , preventing significant tidal deformation and slowing the rate at which angular momentum is transferred between the two bodies ( see equation [ eq : dndt_dobro ] ) .",
    "we find that if charon starts far from the dual - synchronous point ( @xmath170 or @xmath171 ) , pluto must be warmed close to its melting point in order for charon s orbit to evolve in @xmath172 gyr .",

    "such a low viscosity allows enough deformation in the ice shell to permit charon s orbit to evolve , albeit slowly .",
    "if charon starts close to the synchronous point ( @xmath177 ) , evolution times shorter than the age of the solar system are possible for viscosities up to @xmath178 pa s , corresponding to interior temperatures @xmath179 k for the minimum grain size of 0.1 mm , or @xmath180 k for @xmath175 mm .",

    "we find that the heat flows range from @xmath181 to @xmath182 mw m@xmath131 , although the vast majority of orbital scenarios give heat flows of order tens of milliwatts per meter squared .",
    "for the vast majority of orbital evolution scenarios and interior viscosities , the amount of tidal heat deposited in pluto s ice shell will be small enough to allow pluto to remain solid ( and avoid forming an ocean ) during charon s orbital evolution .",
    "figures [ fig : no_ocean]c and [ fig : no_ocean]d illustrate the maximum stresses on the surface of pluto during the orbital evolution .",
    "the maximum stress achieved is large @xmath183 mpa , but decreases as a function of @xmath184 .",
    "tectonic activity is `` likely '' on pluto ( as defined at the end of section [ sec : evolstress ] ) only if the ice shell has a very low viscosity @xmath185 pa s and @xmath186 or @xmath187 .",
    "thus , we consider it likely that charon can evolve into the dual synchronous state even if pluto does not have an ocean and its outer ice shell is mechanically coupled to its much stiffer rock core .",
    "however , pluto will only display evidence of ancient tectonic resurfacing if its interior viscosity is quite low , corresponding to a warm ice shell . for @xmath188 to 10 , model plutos with very warm ice shells could likely experience runaway melting from tides , leading to the formation of an ocean . for @xmath189 to 15.2 , a warm ice shell on pluto can be tectonically active without melting from tidal dissipation .",
    "figure [ fig : undiff ] illustrates our results for an undifferentiated pluto . here",
    ", the entire interior of pluto has a rheology appropriate for water ice , which allows it to experience more tidal deformation and dissipation than a differentiated model pluto without an ocean whose ice shell is rigidly coupled to its rocky core .",
    "we find that an undifferentiated pluto / charon system can reach the dual synchronous state in a time scale less than the age of the solar system if its interior viscosity is less than @xmath190 pa s , or @xmath191 k for @xmath97 mm , or @xmath192 k for @xmath175 mm ( see figure [ fig : undiff]a ) .",
    "an undifferentiated pluto experiences significantly more tidal dissipation than its differentiated counterpart , even if it never has an ocean .",
    "figure [ fig : undiff]b shows the estimated tidal heat fluxes , and the range of interior viscosities that permit freezing or melting of the ice shell . initially high - viscosity ( cold ) shells will remain cold and could thicken .",
    "ice shells that are initially warm , with @xmath193 to @xmath194 pa s , or @xmath195 to 230 k , depending on grain size , will experience strong tidal dissipation in excess of the amount that could be removed by conduction and/or convection , which could lead to melting . because runaway differentiation may be possible in pluto ( see section [ sec : interiors ] ) , we consider that the onset of melting would trigger complete differentiation of the body in addition to thickening of the outer ice shell and formation of an ocean ; the interior state of pluto evolves to that depicted in figure [ fig : interiors]a .",
    "once the ice shell began to melt , the amount of tidal dissipation would decrease since the thickness of the shell had decreased @xcite .",
    "eventually an equilibrium between tidal heat and conductive / convective heat transport may be achieved ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum stress experienced is @xmath196 mpa , far in excess of the strength of water ice .",
    "tectonic activity is `` likely '' on pluto if its ice shell has a viscosity @xmath197 pa s and @xmath170 or @xmath198 . because this viscosity is associated with tidal dissipation that would lead to melting , an undifferentiated pluto is incompatible with tidally - driven tectonic activity .",
    "figure [ fig : ocean ] illustrates the evolution time scale , heat flux , and stresses in pluto during charon s orbital evolution , assuming that pluto is fully differentiated and has a liquid water ocean . similar to the undifferentiated case , the orbital evolution time scale is less than the age of the solar system if @xmath199 pa s. tidal heat can be removed by conduction and/or convection if @xmath200 to @xmath201 pa s , roughly corresponding to @xmath195 to 245 k. the presence of a subsurface ocean permits stresses @xmath202 mpa .",
    "tectonic activity is `` likely '' on pluto if its ice shell has a viscosity @xmath203 pa s and @xmath186 or @xmath187 .",
    "stress due to synchronized lowering of tidal and rotational bulges ( tidal recession ) was calculated on charon for each pluto scenario discussed above . theoretical maximum tensile stress on charon due to tidal recession is @xmath196 mpa , though the thin elastic shell assumption may be less valid for charon than for pluto , as charon is not strongly heated .",
    "tectonic activity is `` likely '' on charon for @xmath204 and for the same ranges of pluto s interior viscosity that made activity likely on pluto for any of the three interior models .",
    "this is because it is pluto s interior that controls the rate of orbital evolution , and thus the rate of stress accumulation versus viscous relaxation .",
    "the _ new horizons _ mission has sparked new interest about the thermal evolution of pluto and its moon charon , in particular , the possibility of tectonic resurfacing on both bodies and the likelihood that these bodies may have had liquid water oceans , either now or in the past . in this work , we have used simple tidal models to calculate the magnitude of stresses expected on the surfaces of pluto and charon during their evolution into the dual - synchronous state . during this time",
    ", pluto de - spins as charon recedes from pluto , potentially leading to enormous stresses on the lithospheres of both bodies .",
    "we conclude that if _ new horizons _ uncovers evidence for ancient tectonic activity consistent with despinning on pluto and/or tidal recession on charon , the most self - consistent explanation is that pluto had an ocean during the time period of charon s orbital evolution .",
    "despinning stresses on pluto would manifest as normal faults at the poles , strike - slip features in the mid - latitudes , and equatorial thrust faults @xcite .",
    "stresses on charon arising from the collapse of its tidal bulge would create normal faults at the poles , strike - slip faults in the mid - latitudes , with a zone of thrust faults at the sub - pluto point @xcite .",
    "concurrent volume changes in the interiors of pluto or charon could add to these predicted stress states and significantly shift the boundaries of the tectonic regions toward or away from the poles or tidal axis .",
    "if _ no _ tectonic features are observed , this could indicate an extremely cold pluto pre- or post - impact ( and thus a very long timescale for orbital evolution ) , or that tectonic features had been removed or buried by other processes .",
    "tectonic features formed by the post - impact evolution could have been obscured by , e.g. , later flooding by cryomagmas .",
    "it is also possible that infall of pluto s tenuous atmosphere may subdue landforms created by ancient tectonics .",
    "we find that the orbital evolution time scale for charon depends sensitively on the interior thermal state of pluto .",
    "this is because the tidal quality factor of pluto , which controls the rate at which angular momentum is transferred from pluto s spin to charon s orbit , depends on @xmath11 , which in turn depends on the viscosity of its interior .",
    "a cold , highly viscous ( `` stiff '' ) pluto will shed angular momentum more slowly than a warm , low - viscosity pluto .",
    "if pluto is differentiated and has a liquid water ocean , its ice shell is no longer rigidly coupled to its rock core , permitting large tidal deformations and rapid tidal evolution even if the ice shell has a high viscosity . for charon to evolve to the dual synchronous state on a time scale less than the age of the solar system , a fully differentiated pluto with an ocean ( figure [ fig : ocean ] ) must be warmed post - impact to a temperature @xmath205 to 190 k , so that the viscosity of the convecting portion of its ice shell , @xmath206 pa s. similar conditions must be achieved in an undifferentiated pluto .",
    "however , we consider it likely that pluto is differentiated either before or during charon s tidal evolution because the energy liberated during accretion is sufficient to melt its ice , pluto is unstable to runaway differentiation , and its high mean density implies a high rock fraction in the interior and thus , ample radiogenic heat .",
    "if pluto did not have an ocean during charon s orbital evolution , its interior must be warmed to @xmath207 to 260 k for pluto and charon to evolve to the dual synchronous state .",
    "temperatures this high would lead to melting , particularly if pluto has even just a small amount of ammonia or low - eutectic salt mixed in with its ices . while it is possible for orbital evolution to drive tectonics on pluto and charon for any of the assumed interior models for pluto , the thermal / orbital pathway of the system depends sensitively on the interior states of pluto and charon , which may change over time . for example , in the differentiated model without an ocean , tectonics can only occur if charon starts close to its current location , and pluto s ice is very close to the melting point ( but not molten ) . in the undifferentiated model ,",
    "tectonic activity occurs if the ice has a low viscosity , but this same low viscosity ice will dissipate enough heat to begin melting and possibly trigger runaway differentiation . in the differentiated pluto model with an interior ocean ,",
    "tectonic activity occurs above an interior that has the right viscosity for a floating , conducting or convecting ice shell .",
    "thus , more detailed calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) will be warranted once the _ new horizons _ mission has returned its data .",
