    "the coherent large - scale flow structure is one of the most important constituents in turbulent thermal convections , which occur widely in the oceans , the atmosphere , the earth s outer core and galaxies @xcite .",
    "its detailed flow dynamics has been mainly investigated in the classical rayleigh - bnard convection system , where a confined enclosure is heated from below and cooled from above @xcite .",
    "the system has three control parameters , namely the rayleigh number ( @xmath7 ) , prandtl number ( @xmath8 ) and the aspect ratio ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the rayleigh number is defined as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 being , respectively , the thermal expansion coefficient , the kinematic viscosity , and the thermal diffusivity of working fluid .",
    "the prandtl number is defined as pr@xmath15 , and the aspect ratio @xmath9 is the ratio of the lateral dimension of the system to its height . in the system , a prominent self - sustained low frequency oscillation of the measured local velocity and/or temperature has been generally observed in numerous experiments and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of this characteristic frequency still remains elusive although much effort has been made to tackle this issue in the past decades .",
    "explanation of low frequency oscillations can be traced to the  bubble model \" @xcite and later the  plume model \" @xcite , which were developed based on the presence and persistence of thermal structures ( _ e.g. _ thermals , plumes ) @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that a thermal boundary layer thickens in time by the upward diffusion of the temperature field .",
    "when a critical thickness is attained , the boundary layer will erupt and quickly expel all the buoyant fluid through plumes and thermals away from the boundary .",
    "the depleted boundary layer thus grows once more by diffusion and the process repeats in a periodic manner .",
    "such a phenomenological picture has been observed in high pr fluid with the shadowgraph technique @xcite . in later experiments",
    ", it has been observed that the unique frequency is related to the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) in a helium gas cylindrical cell with @xmath16 @xcite , and its value is more or less the same as the circulation frequency of the large convective flow .",
    "a coupled - oscillator model was proposed to explain the observed phenomenon , in which the plume clusters from one plate are triggered by those from the opposite plate and the overall process will be self - sustained @xcite .",
    "a prediction of the model is that the oscillation period is twice of the cell - crossing time of the clustered plumes .",
    "this has been verified by later direct velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "all the above mentioned models suggest that the thermal plumes and the thermal boundary layers play a dominant role in the generation of the oscillation .    in thermal convection",
    ", it has been found that , for the most part , the lsc has a preferred orientation in @xmath16 cylindrical cells and it oscillates azimuthally around this orientation @xcite .",
    "recently , several new dynamic processes , _ e.g. _ reorientation , cessation and so on , have been observed in the cylindrical cells @xcite , but it has been argued that such processes have little relevance to the azimuthal oscillation @xcite .",
    "based on the phenomenon of horizontal oscillations of lsc @xcite , a new dynamical model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this model suggests that the horizontal oscillation of large scale flow is the main source of the low frequency oscillation in the system . instead of being caused by the periodic plume - ejections from the boundary layers ,",
    "this horizontal oscillation is intrinsic to the bulk dynamics .",
    "the periodical ejections of plumes may then be viewed as passive objects of the process .",
    "the lsc dynamical picture can be simplified if the large scale reorientations or cessations are not considered , the horizontal oscillation of lsc will be analogous to a classical harmonic oscillator wandering around its origin . in this case , one may wonder whether the system geometry plays a role in the horizontal oscillations of the lsc . in most cases experiments and simulations",
    "have been performed mainly in a cylindrical cell of aspect ratio one in which axis - symmetry holds and only one large scale convective roll exists @xcite . at low ra , the linear stability analysis predicted that one asymmetric convection roll occupies the whole bulk regime when the cell provides an axis - symmetric boundary condition @xcite , and the convection roll could be aligned in any direction around the circle @xcite .",
    "but in real systems there are inevitably imperfections , initial instabilities and other external factors , which lead to the evolution of one stable branch , with all other branches being unstable @xcite . in numerical simulations",
    ", similar picture could be expected for the case of high ra convection @xcite .    in this paper , we report turbulent thermal convection experiments in a rectangular cell , in which the axis - symmetry is absent .",

    "there is no temperature oscillation in the central region of the cell .",

    "could be found everywhere in the bulk regime from the horizontal velocity measurement , and the oscillating intensity is stronger in the center than that in other positions @xcite .",
    "recently , the oscillation has also been explored in a rectangular cell , where the horizontal cross section is square and the aspect ratio @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the oscillation stems from the periodical switching between two corotating convective rolls .",
    "therefore , the oscillations observed in the present system should not share the same dynamic mechanism as that case because only one large scale roll exists here @xcite . unlike the recent convection experiment in a rectangular box     as function of @xmath18 when the measured position moves from the cell center to the sidewall.,width=288 ]    next , we discuss the position dependence of the oscillation periods , @xmath42 and @xmath41 , obtained from temperature and velocity fields repectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] , we can see that within experimental uncertainty the temperature oscillation period ( @xmath42 ) may be regarded as a constant for all the positions measured , @xmath60 seconds for both the vertical and horizontal scans .",

    "note that @xmath61 is about @xmath63 less than @xmath42 , such a difference between the two oscillation periods is beyond the experimental uncertainties for the respective measurements .     along the line ( @xmath21 ) ( solid squares ) and temperature signals along the lines ( @xmath21 ) ( open circles ) and ( @xmath24 ) ( solid circles).,width=288 ]      keeping constant pr@xmath64",

    "[ fig : ra ] , we can see that @xmath72 and @xmath73 have comparable magnitude , but their difference can be well discerned .",

    "the exponent agrees excellently with the temperature oscillation measurements in low temperature helium gas @xcite , mercury @xcite , and water @xcite of a cylindrical cell , the different prefactors are perhaps due to the fluids of different pr .",
    "moreover , the scaling is consistent with that of the angular oscillations of the horizontal thermal plume motion above the bottom plate in a cylindrical cell @xcite .",
    "this result confirms that the temperature oscillation is the global and universal character in thermal convection , and this result also implies that temperature oscillation period ( @xmath42 ) is a result of flow motions of thermal structures and independent of system geometry .",
    "we also notice that some experiments have reported different scalings for temperature oscillation period ( @xmath42 ) in the cylindrical cell @xcite .",

    "that is , the velocity and temperature oscillations are generated by the alternating emission of thermal plumes between the upper and lower thermal boundary layers @xcite .",

    "these results suggest that the velocity oscillation period is consistent with the rotational period of the large scale flow in both cylindrical and rectangular cells , and both of them could be affected by the system geometry .",
    "based on the results that temperature and velocity oscillations have different responses to the system geometry , it may be proposed that the two oscillations reflect different aspects of the thermal convective flow even though they are related to each other .",
    "in this work , both temperature and velocity oscillations can be found in the rectangular cell , where only one large - scale convection roll exists . at fixed ra ( @xmath32 ) , it is found that temperature oscillation can be observed in most of the locations in which measurements were made , and they gave a position - independent oscillation period , @xmath2 seconds . for measurements made with different @xmath7 , the normalized oscillation period @xmath72 is found to scale as @xmath74 , which is the same as that found in cylindrical cells @xcite .",
    "this scaling is also the same as that obtained from the horizontal motions of thermal structures ( plumes ) @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that temperature oscillation is a global and universal characteristic of turbulent thermal convection , and its statistical behavior may be related to the flow motions of thermal structures and are independent of system geometry .",
    "it is a surprise that the oscillation in the velocity field can not be seen in its vertical component @xmath22 near the sidewall .",
    "if the thermal bursts are erupted in a periodical way , it should be detected by the vertical velocity because the thermal bursts are driven vertically under the buoyancy force .",
    "however , velocity oscillation can only be observed in its horizontal component ( @xmath3 ) at positions close to the sidewall , where its histogram exhibits two peaks .",
    "the normalized velocity oscillation period @xmath73 shows an ra - dependence of @xmath78 and it collapses very well on that obtained from the rotation rate of convective flow @xcite .",
    "this is different from the observation in the cylindrical cell @xcite , where it was reported that the periods for both the velocity and temperature oscillations and the rotational period of the convective flow follow the same scaling @xcite .",
