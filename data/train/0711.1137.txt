    "warm absorbers are highly photoionised gas found along our line of sight to the continuum source of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "their signatures are a wealth of absorption lines and edges from highly ionized species , notably ovii , oviii , fexvii , nex , cv and cvi in the soft x - ray ( 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) spectra .",
    "the typical column density observed for the gas is @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath2 is estimated to be a few times @xmath3 . for many objects",
    "the warm absorber exists as a multiphase absorbing medium with all the phases in near pressure equilibrium ( morales , fabian & reynolds , 2000 ; collinge 2001 ; kaastra 2002 ; krongold 2003 ; netzer 2003 ; krongold 2005 ; ashton 2006 ) .",
    "any stable photoionised gas will lie on the thermal equilibrium curve or ` stability ' curve , in the temperature - pressure phase space , where heating balances cooling ; this curve is often used to study the multiphase nature of the photoionised gas .",
    "the equilibrium depends on the shape of the ionizing continuum and the chemical abundance of the gas ( krolik , mckee & tarter , 1981 ; krolik & kriss , 2001 ; reynolds & fabian , 1995 and komossa & mathur , 2001 ) .",
    "we are investigating this dependences in details and will report elsewhere ( chakravorty , to be submitted ) .",
    "over the past two decades the estimates of dielectronic recombination rate coefficients have improved . in this letter",
    "we show that these have affected the stability curves significantly which may lead to quite different physical models for the warm absorber gas .",
    "we conclude with a caution on the reliability of earlier results .",
    "as is customary , we consider an optically thin , plane parallel slab of gas being photoionised by the central source of the agn . in ionization equilibrium ,",
    "photoionisation is balanced by recombinations .",
    "thermal equilibrium is achieved when photoionisation and compton heating are balanced by collisional cooling , recombination , line - excitation , bremsstrahlung and compton cooling .",
    "the conditions under which these equilibriums are achieved depend on the shape of the continuum , metallicity of the gas , the density , the column density , and the ratio of the ionizing photon flux to the gas density . following the convention of tarter , tucker & salpeter ( 1969 )",
    "we specify this ratio through an _ ionization parameter _",
    "@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the luminosity of the source and @xmath6 the number density of gas at a distance @xmath7 from the center of the agn .",
    "we consider a sequence of models for a range of ionization parameters @xmath8 , for optically thin gas having constant density of @xmath9 , being irradiated by a power - law ionizing continuum with photon index @xmath10 , so that @xmath11 , and extending from 13.6 ev to 40 kev .",
    "the chemical composition of the gas ( referred to as _ old solar abundance _ ) is is due to grevesse and anders ( 1989 ) with extensions by grevesse and noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "these parameter values ( hereafter called the _ standard set _ of parameters ) have been considered because that allows us to compare our results easily with earlier work .    using version c07.02.01 ( hereafter c07 ) of the photoionisation code cloudy ( see ferland 1998 for a description ) , we plot the thermal stability curve which is shown as the solid curve ( labeled c07 ) in .",
    "@xmath12 is proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the radiation pressure and @xmath15 the gas pressure ; so an isobaric perturbation of a system in equilibrium is represented by a vertical displacement from the curve , and only changes the temperature .",
    "if the system being perturbed is located on a part of the curve with positive slope , which covers most of the curve , then a perturbation corresponding to an increase in temperature leads to cooling , while a decrease in temperature leads to heating of the gas .",
    "such a gas is therefore thermally stable .",
    "but if the system is located on one of the few parts of the curve with negative slope , then it is thermally unstable because isobaric perturbations will lead to runaway heating or cooling .",
    "reynolds & fabian ( 1995 , hereafter rf95 ) , have studied the stability curve for the warm absorber in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , using the standard set of parameters given above .",
    "we have reproduced their curve , as given in figure 3 of rf95 , using version c84.12a ( hereafter c84 ) of cloudy , which was the stable version between 1993 and 1996 ; this is shown as the dashed curve in .",
    "the c84 and c07 curves match at high temperatures in the range @xmath16 , where compton heating and cooling dominate .",
    "they also agree at low temperatures @xmath17 . however , the curves are significantly different in the intermediate temperature range @xmath18 , which is the region of interest for the warm absorbers and where recombination and line excitation are dominant cooling mechanisms .",

    "the second column of the table shows that for an absorber at @xmath24 , c84 predicts @xmath25 , as compared to @xmath26 obtained from the c07 stability curve , where @xmath19 is defined to be the ionization parameter corresponding to the middle of the @xmath3 stable warm absorber phase .",
    "both c84 and c07 predict two discrete phases of warm absorber at @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are in pressure equilibrium with each other and have been highlighted in .",
    "the c07 curve continues to have stable thermal states at @xmath29 which is not true in the c84 case . the range of @xmath30 , over which the warm absorber exists are given in the fourth and fifth columns of respectively for the low and high temperature states .",
    "the extent of the @xmath3 phase in @xmath30 is about four times larger in c07 , predicting greater probability of finding @xmath3 warm absorbers . in the sixth column",
    "we have compared the range @xmath23 where the warm absorber exhibits multiple phases .",
    "c07 predicts a 40% larger range and hence greater possibility of a multiphase warm absorber .    in order to isolate the atomic physics",
    "underlying the change in the stability curve , we have plotted the fractional variation of temperature @xmath31 , from one version to another , against @xmath32 in the top panel of .",
    "we see that @xmath33 for a major part of the range @xmath34 , so that the gas is predicted to be cooler by c07 .",
    "the cooling fractions ( @xmath35 ) of the major cooling agents and the heating fractions ( @xmath36 ) contributed by the principal heating agents using c07 are plotted against @xmath32 respectively in the middle and bottom panel of .",
    "the ions that contribute significantly where @xmath37 , are he@xmath38 and high - ionization species of silicon ( + 10 and + 11 ) and iron ( + 21 , + 22 and + 23 ) . in the same @xmath39 range ,",
    "the principal heating agents are highly ionized species of oxygen ( + 6 and + 7 ) and iron ( + 17 to + 25 ) .",
    "to identify the ions which are responsible for @xmath40 , we compare their column densities predicted by c84 and c07 . in the previous photoionisation calculations in this paper it was sufficient to use one zone models for optically thin gas",
    ". however , to calculate and compare the column densities of the ions over the range @xmath41 , we chose to specify the gas to have total hydrogen column density @xmath42 , which is typical for warm absorbers .",
    "the column densities are plotted in with solid lines for c07 and dashed lines for c84 .",
    "it is seen that the column densities of the major coolants changed significantly .",
    "the cooling agents are among the ions for which dielectronic recombination rate coefficients ( hereafter drrc ) have been updated to the references below , as will be discussed in detail in .",
    "thus the enhanced cooling in c07 due to the change in drrc is the cause of the shift in the stability curves .",

    "we have compared the total recombination rates ( dielectronic + radiative ) for the significant cooling agents as predicted by c07 and c84 .",
    "the values for @xmath43 and @xmath32 at which the comparisons have been made are given in columns 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "for all the ions the total recombination rates are significantly higher in c07 than in c84 as shown by columns 4 and 5 .",
    "referring to , we see that the differences in total recombination rates are relatively larger for ions like si@xmath44 , si@xmath47 , fe@xmath48 and fe@xmath49 which are significant cooling agents for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , corresponding to which we have maximum difference in predicted equilibrium temperatures @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    in the warm absorber temperature range @xmath57 ,",
    "dielectronic recombination dominates over radiative recombination for many ions ( osterbrock & ferland , 2006 ) . unlike the radiative recombination rate coefficients ,",
    "the drrc have undergone significant changes over the last decade .",
    "c84 used drrc from nussbaumer & storey ( 1983;1984 ; 1986 ; and 1987 ) and arnaud & raymond ( 1992 ) . in c07",
    "we have taken the drrc for the isoelectronic sequences of lithium , beryllium , boron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and iron - like ions respectively from colgan ( 2004 ) , colgan ( 2003 ) , altun ( 2004 ) , zatsarinny ( 2004a ) , mitnik & badnell ( 2004 ) , zatsarinny ( 2003 ) , and gu ( 2003 ) .",
    "the drrc for ne to na like ions and na to mg like ions are taken from zatsarinny ( 2004b ) and gu ( 2004 ) .",
    "the c07 drrc for any given ion is usually substantially larger than the c84 drrc when the temperature is much lower than the ionization potential of the ion .",
    "the significant cooling agents in c07 are among these ions .",
    "this indicates that the updated drrc database in c07 is the cause of the changes in the stability curve .",
    "it is seen from that the increase in recombination rates from c84 to c07 is larger for the lower ionization species .",
    "the reason for the large increase , in general , in the low - temperature drrc ( referenced above ) is the explicit inclusion of the contribution from low - lying ( in energy ) level - resolved dielectronic recombination resonances which have been accurately positioned by reference to the observed core energies . unlike high - temperature dielectronic recombination , where the full rydberg series contributes",
    ", low - temperature dielectronic recombination is not amenable to simple scaling or empirical formulae or guesses .",
    "zatsarinny et al ( 2003 ) illustrate the radical and erratic changes in the low - temperature drrc on moving between adjacent ions of the same isoelectronic sequence and , even , on changing from a term - resolved picture to level - resolved one for the same ion .",
    "the drrc database is still not complete , specially for the lower ionization states . for ions which do not have computed drrc values",
    ", c07 uses a solution , as suggested by ali ( 1991 ) : for any given kinetic temperature , ions that lack data are given drrc values that are the averages of all ions with the same charge .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the assumed rates are within the range of existing published rates at the given kinetic temperature and hence can not be drastically off .",
    "however we have checked whether the points in the c07 stability curves have computed drrc values or guessed average values , concentrating on the parts of the curve which have multiphase solutions for the warm absorber ( @xmath58 ) and are different from the c84 stability curve .",
    "we find that all the ions which act as major cooling agents for each of these points in the stability curve have reliable computed drrc values .",
    "thus , the new data base provides a more robust measurement of the various physical parameters involved in studying the thermal and ionization equilibrium of photoionised gas .",
    "we have shown that stability curves for warm absorbers in agn generated by two versions of the ionization code cloudy , c84 and c07 , for the same physical conditions , are substantially different in shape , leading to different conclusions regarding the nature of the warm absorber .",
    "the differences in the results of the photoionisation calculations arise due to major changes in the dielectronic recombination rate coefficient ( drrc ) data bases which have taken place over the last decade .",
    "the modern version c07 includes reliable computed drrc values for many more ions than c84 for the entire part of the stability curve relevant for warm absorbers and does not rely on guessed average values .",
    "thus , the physical nature of the warm absorber predicted by modern calculations are more reliable .",
    "we suggest that past calculations for photoionised plasma in thermal equilibrium should be reconsidered , taking into account these changes . since , any other atomic physics code ( eg . xstar ) , in popular use for warm absorber studies",
    ", is also likely to be affected by the changes in the drrc data base , caution should be exercised while using or comparing results from them as well .",
