    "nucleon structure functions and their scale evolution are closely related to the origins of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the gauge theory of the strong interaction . with high - precision data from hera and the tevatron available and in view of the outstanding importance of hard scattering processes at the forthcoming lhc ,",
    "a quantitative understanding of the nucleon s structure in terms of parton distributions is indispensable . in this respect ,",
    "highlights of the workshop were new hera measurements at low-@xmath1 and large-@xmath2 , and news on global analyses of parton density functions .",
    "the kinematical region of low-@xmath0 is of particular interest here , because of the rapidly growing gluon density at very small momentum fractions .",
    "consequences of effective theoretical descriptions can for instance be tested on results for measurements of forward jets .    in this summary",
    "we give a concise overview of recent experimental and theoretical efforts in this direction , which were presented at our working group  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the inclusive structure functions in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) is one of the primary tasks of the hera collider . for the neutral current ( nc ) process",
    "the hera experiments have reported so far on the measurements of the dominant structure function @xmath3 and of the structure function @xmath4 .",
    "the scientific program of structure function measurements however is incomplete without measuring the longitudinal structure function @xmath5 and the hera collider provides a unique opportunity to do so .      a measurement of the dis cross section by the h1 collaboration in the kinematical domain @xmath6  gev@xmath7 was presented by vargas .",
    "the measurement is based on a dedicated `` shifted vertex '' run which improved the detector acceptance for low @xmath1 and a `` minimum bias '' run with open triggers for low-@xmath1 inclusive data .",
    "both runs were done during the hera - i period in 1999 and 2000 .",
    "the new preliminary data are combined with the published h1 results  @xcite using an averaging procedure which takes into account correlated systematic uncertainties .",
    "r70 mm        as shown in figure  [ fig : h1lqf2 ] , the data are in good agreement with the publications of the zeus collaboration at even lower @xmath1  @xcite and at @xmath8  gev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the new data fills the gap in @xmath1 between the previous measurements and also extends to high values of the inelasticity , @xmath9 , where the cross section is sensitive to the longitudinal structure function @xmath5 although limited to a precision of @xmath10 . for lower values of @xmath2 , the precision of the new result reaches @xmath11 for @xmath12  gev@xmath7 , which is an initial step to the ultimate goal of achieving a @xmath13 precision .",
    "a measurement of the longitudinal structure function @xmath5 is the next challenge for the hera experiments . for this measurement",
    "two conditions must be satisfied :    * the experiments must measure the dis cross section for high inelasticity @xmath14 with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "* hera must run with different center of mass energies such that the dis cross section can be determined for the same values of @xmath15 but at different @xmath2 .",
    "results at high-@xmath2 were presented by raicevic and shimizu for the h1 and zeus collaborations , respectively .",
    "the measurement at high-@xmath2 is especially difficult at lower @xmath1 , because of the high level of photoproduction background .",
    "high values of @xmath2 in this kinematical domain correspond to a low energy of the scattered electron which complicates the electron identification .    to that end , h1 has developed a measurement technique in which the background contribution is estimated by using electron candidates with a measured charge opposite to the lepton beam charge . here",
    ", the @xmath16 data is used to estimate the background for the @xmath17 data and vice versa . a new preliminary h1 result based on the entire hera - ii sample collected with dedicated low energy triggers",
    "utilizes the large @xmath17 sample , which has not been available during the hera - i period .",
    "the new cross section measurement is based on @xmath18  pb@xmath19 of data where @xmath20  pb@xmath19 is from @xmath16 and @xmath21  pb@xmath19 from @xmath17 interactions .",
    "this corresponds to more than a ten - fold increase of the total luminosity compared to the previously published result  @xcite .",
    "the measurement covers the range @xmath22  gev@xmath7 for the inelasticity @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig : h1hy ] shows the measured cross sections together with the previous results .",
    "the new preliminary measurement has total uncertainties reduced by factor of two and the total errors are at @xmath24 level .     at hera as measured by zeus and shown in a ratio to the theory prediction as a function of @xmath0 at several values of @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : zehy],scaledwidth=98.0% ]     at hera as measured by zeus and shown in a ratio to the theory prediction as a function of @xmath0 at several values of @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : zehy],scaledwidth=98.0% ]    further improvements are possible with a better understanding of the tracking efficiency .",
    "the large statistics of the sample is very important for detailed studies of the experimental condition at high-@xmath2 , as needed for the direct measurement of the structure function @xmath5 .",
    "zeus has also performed a cross section measurement optimized for the high-@xmath2 kinematic range , based on @xmath25  pb@xmath19 of @xmath16 collision data collected during year 2006  @xcite . in the zeus analysis ,",
    "the photoproduction background is controlled by using a small calorimeter installed close to the beam pipe .",
    "it tags electrons which have escaped down the beam pipe in photoproduction events , thus providing a direct measure of the photoproduction background .",
    "compared to the previous measurement  @xcite , the new measurement extends to high values of @xmath2 up until @xmath9 , providing also more data points at @xmath26 and @xmath27  gev@xmath7 , as shown in figure  [ fig : zehy ] .",
    "it serves also as a good demonstration of the feasibility of performing measurements with low energy electrons , which is a necessary prerequisite for future @xmath5 measurements .",
    "bhadra has reported on a zeus measurement of the nc cross sections at large values of @xmath1 , aiming at pinning down the proton with smallest spatial resolution .",
    "the measurement makes use of the full luminosity of @xmath17 collision data at hera - ii , which amounts to 177 pb@xmath19 .",
    "the measured cross section showed a good agreement with the standard model prediction up to a very large value of @xmath28  gev@xmath7 , i.e. down to distances of about @xmath29  m.    l65 mm        from this measurement together with the previous @xmath16 measurement from hera - i , the structure function @xmath4 , which is sensitive to the valence quarks , was extracted as shown in figure  [ fig : zef3 ] .",
    "the zeus measurement will provide important information at smaller @xmath0 in the region of @xmath30 .",
    "this is in contrast to fixed target dis experiments which provide data on @xmath4 at large @xmath0 in the region of @xmath31 .",
    "it was also pointed out that the zeus data is collected on a pure proton - target at high @xmath1 , so that the theoretical uncertainties is significantly less compared to fixed target dis .",
    "the last three months of hera operation were dedicated to the measurement of the longitudinal proton structure function @xmath5 using beams with a reduced proton energy .",
    "a first look at the machine performance and the data quality collected by the two experiments was presented by klein . in general the hera performance exceeded the initial expectations . instead of the planned data sample of @xmath32  pb@xmath19 at a proton energy of @xmath33  gev ,",
    "each of the two experiments collected about @xmath34  pb@xmath19 at @xmath35  gev and additionally , about @xmath36  pb@xmath19 at @xmath37  gev . the intermediate proton energy data at @xmath37  gev should allow for an important cross check of the measurements since the systematic uncertainties , in particular the photoproduction background , are different for the same bins of @xmath15 but different values of @xmath38 .",
    "the online checks of the data show a good quality and near to optimal performance of the detectors . based on this ,",
    "klein concluded that the data for the measurement of the longitudinal structure function @xmath5 were taken successfully , with the next step being a rigorous analysis of these data .",
    "eventually , the measurements will have to be confronted to perturbative qcd predictions  @xcite and will provide additional information on the gluon distribution at low scales and small @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is in fact poorly known so far , and has led some analyses in the past  @xcite to prefer a rather small gluon density in this region , to the extend that at nlo in qcd @xmath5 can become almost zero at @xmath39 and very small @xmath0 .",
    "parton density functions ( pdfs ) were a central topic of many presentations .",
    "this is motivated by the need to have a consistent description of the nucleon s parton content starting from lower scales , were new data sets e.g. from fixed target neutrino - nucleon scattering have become available and theoretical concepts like higher twist are important .",
    "evolution up to high scales by means of perturbative qcd then provides precision predictions for parton luminosities in hard scattering processes at the energy frontier .      to start with the latter ,",
    "thorne has presented a parameterization of pdfs based on a consistent evolution through next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in perturbative qcd . as a new result",
    "a pdf set with errors at nnlo is now available  @xcite , where the best fit is supplemented by 30 additional sets representing the uncertainties of the partons ( in the hessian approach ) .",
    "the benefits of nnlo qcd predictions are generally improved stability with respect to scale variations and a consistently better fit than in nlo perturbation theory . furthermore",
    ", higher orders resolve more features of theory , as e.g. the different quark flavor combinations of the pdfs ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) are all governed by different kernels  @xcite .    based on this work",
    ", thorne has also reported on a preliminary set of updated nlo pdfs now called mstw  @xcite for use at lhc .",
    "main emphasis here besides an improved gluon extraction with the help of jet data from hera and tevatron was on the separation of flavors in the proton .",
    "most importantly , the down quark valence distribution @xmath43 was constrained by lepton asymmetry data from cdf run ii . also , with new results for neutrino - structure functions from chorus and nutev  @xcite and the ccfr / nutev dimuon cross sections  @xcite a quantitative extraction of the strange quark and antiquark distributions and their uncertainties",
    "has become feasible . upon relaxing previous assumptions on the parameterization",
    ", @xmath44\\qquad ( \\kappa \\approx 0.5),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the input scale of @xmath45 , a direct fit of @xmath46 and @xmath47 to the ccfr / nutev dimuon cross sections now becomes possible .",
    "this point of view has been shared by tung  @xcite who presented updates on pdf determinations from global qcd analyses for cteq .",
    "in particular , cteq also determined the strangeness on the proton  @xcite along with the consequences for the strange asymmetry .",
    "the latter are of interest , because a non - zero @xmath48 has long been identified as a potential explanation for the `` nutev anomaly '' in the measurement of the weak mixing angle @xmath49 .",
    "current global analyses do not require a non - zero @xmath48 , but they are consistent with one and the integrated momentum asymmetry for the best fit is small and ( mostly ) positive .    new measurements of the double differential cc neutrino / anti - neutrino scattering cross section by the nutev experiment were reported by radescu .",
    "the new data show agreement with the other neutrino - iron scattering experiments ccfr  @xcite and cdhsw  @xcite at lower @xmath50 while for @xmath51 the ccfr result is consistently below nutev . for @xmath52",
    "the difference between nutev and ccfr is about @xmath53 .",
    "the high-@xmath0 kinematic range is challenging for both experiments and part of the difference can be explained by improvements of the experimental techniques .",
    "nutev extracts the structure functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 and performs a nlo qcd fit with the charm quark contribution accounted for by using the acot scheme  @xcite to obtain a rather large value @xmath54 .",
    "the controversy surrounding the new nutev structure functions measurements is further enhanced if the new results are compared to the predictions of mstw and cteq which agree better with ccfr than with nutev .",
    "the fits for pdf predictions are based on lepton scattering data .",
    "thus the difference between nutev and the former predictions may be explained by the difference of the lepton - iron versus neutrino - iron nuclear screening corrections .    to improve the theoretical treatment of the neutrino scattering data , rogal reported on the calculation of three - loop qcd corrections to the coefficient functions in paschos - wolfenstein relation  @xcite , i.e. the observable measured by nutev to extract @xmath49 . based on the calculation of first five integer mellin moments for the charged current structure functions @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath55  @xcite the convergence of the perturbative series could be studied , which is well under control for this observable .",
    "on the theory side , cteq has improved the treatment of the charm - threshold in their global analysis by implementing now a general - mass formalism , which is consistent with qcd factorization .",
    "the improved description of the ( anti-)strange quark distributions leads to interesting implications for collider phenomenology .",
    "for instance the production of a charged higgs boson @xmath56 via the partonic process @xmath57 , provides an example of a beyond standard model ( bsm ) process that is sensitive to the strange pdf in models with two or more higgs doublets .",
    "the cross section also depends on a possible intrinsic charm component of the proton and the recent pdf set cteq6.5c provides various models for such a component  @xcite .",
    "overall , directly fitting the @xmath58 and @xmath59 distributions affects the correlated uncertainties on the light sea quarks .",
    "an independent uncertainty on @xmath58 and @xmath59 feeds into that on the @xmath60 and @xmath61 quarks , because the neutral current dis data on @xmath62 constrains the combination @xmath63 . as an upshot ,",
    "the size of the uncertainty on the sea quarks for values @xmath64 at hard scales @xmath65 roughly doubles from @xmath66 to @xmath67 for mstw .",
    "also cteq has reported on significant changes in the light quark pdfs between the new cteq6.5 and the older cteq6.1 sets .",
    "thorne also reminded that currently in the absence of measurements the error on the gluon density at low-@xmath0 , say @xmath68 is largely due to the parameterization bias . in summary ,",
    "the inclusion of new data and the changes in the analysis have had a significant impact on the nlo parton distributions .",
    "new results from the tevatron experiments were presented by robson and toole .",
    "the tevatron @xmath70 data provides important constraints for @xmath71 and @xmath72 valence quarks via a measurement of the @xmath73 charge asymmetry and , of the gluon pdf at high-@xmath0 by measuring the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "recently , the experiments were focused on the extension of their measurement range to larger rapidities @xmath74 thus probing the low-@xmath0 domain .",
    "this is of special interest for standard model processes at lhc , because kinematically central rapidities @xmath75 at lhc correspond to @xmath76 at tevatron .",
    "charge asymmetry at tevatron , measured by cdf shown as a function of rapidity of the @xmath77 .",

    "[ fig : cdwa],scaledwidth=98.0% ]    robson presented for the cdf collaboration new measurements of the @xmath78 rapidity distribution based on @xmath79  fb@xmath19 of data from run ii .",
    "the data extends in rapidity to @xmath80 and shows agreement with nnlo qcd predictions .",
    "for @xmath81 the experimental precision is currently about @xmath82 , which should be improved with larger statistics . for the d@xmath69 collaboration the measurement of the @xmath78 rapidity distribution based on @xmath83  fb@xmath19 of data",
    "was presented by toole .",
    "this data has already a precision of @xmath84 for @xmath85 and is also in good agreement with nnlo qcd predictions as shown in figure  [ fig : d0zy ] .",
    "cdf also extended the @xmath73 cross section measurements to the forward region of @xmath86 . for that purpose they used the forward silicon detectors for lepton identification .",
    "they reported on a measurement of the cross section ratio in @xmath87 to @xmath86 , which provides additional constraints on the pdfs at small @xmath0 .    both experiments , cdf and d@xmath69 , reported @xmath73 charge asymmetry measurement based on their run ii data .",
    "cdf showed results using the standard approach which relies on the lepton rapidity and a new method which reconstructs @xmath73 rapidity with up to two - fold ambiguity based on the @xmath77 mass as a constraint .",
    "better forward tracking allows to extend the measurement to higher rapidities .",
    "for @xmath88 the precision of the measurement is comparable to the current pdf uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdwa ] shows the measured @xmath73 charge asymmetry with the new method .",
    "d@xmath69 showed the @xmath73 asymmetry measurement using @xmath89 decays .",
    "this measurement has a small systematic uncertainty dominated by differences in the efficiencies for positive and negative muons , with the errors being comparable to the present pdf accuracy .    finally , cdf has shown inclusive jet cross section results using the @xmath90 and the midpoint jet clustering algorithms based on run ii data .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdje ] shows the cross sections in a ratio to qcd theory at nlo as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "the new results are consistent with the pdf predictions , which in turn are based on run i data .",
    "d@xmath69 presented a new measurement of the @xmath92-jet differential cross sections for different @xmath93-system topologies .",
    "they observed disagreement between the data and theory prediction for the @xmath94 distribution , similar to previous observations by ua2 and cdf , as shown in figure  [ fig : d0ga ] .",
    "shown in a ratio to qcd theory prediction .",
    "[ fig : d0ga],scaledwidth=98.0% ]     shown in a ratio to qcd theory prediction .",
    "[ fig : d0ga],scaledwidth=98.0% ]      the imminent question of how these improvements in the parameterizations of pdfs affect predictions for physical cross sections at lhc was addressed by cooper - sarkar  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was pointed out by her that the predictions for @xmath73- and @xmath78-production cross sections at lhc ( which are sensitive to pdfs in the @xmath95 range ) shift by 8% between the pdf sets cteq6.5 and cteq6.1  a fact that had also been discussed by tung .",
    "previously , theory predictions for these processes were thought to be known well enough to be used as a parton luminosity monitor  @xcite .",
    "therefore , cooper - sarkar explored which lhc measurements may crucially depend on our knowledge of pdfs and , in turn , which might be used to improve it .    in summary",
    ", she stated that pdf uncertainties will have a significant impact on the precision of @xmath73- and @xmath78-cross - sections , although the @xmath96-ratio would still be a golden calibration measurement .",
    "high-@xmath97 jet cross - sections , hence the discovery of new physics parameterized in terms of contact interactions would also depend on uncertainty of the gluon pdf especially at low-@xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", pdf uncertainties would not affect the discovery potential of a higgs in the mass range @xmath98 or a high mass @xmath99 in the mass range @xmath100 .",
    "promising measurements to be conducted at lhc itself include hadronic di - jets and direct photon production to constrain the gluon pdf at low-@xmath0 or the @xmath73-asymmetry to pin down the low-@xmath0 valence pdfs .",
    "another study by thorne addressed the issue of combining leading - order ( lo ) partonic matrix elements with different orders of parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "different prescription for those combinations were compared to the default standard defined by using nlo in qcd for both matrix elements of the hard scattering process and parton distributions .",
    "this investigation aims at determining which parton distributions are most appropriate to use in those cases where only lo matrix elements are available , as e.g. in many monte carlo generators .",
    "it turned out , that the prescriptions are largely depended on the observable under consideration , but this is an important question to be investigated further in the future .",
    "further improvements of global pdf analyses rely on the possibility to resum perturbation theory in kinematical regions , where large logarithms occur .",
    "yuan advocated to include transverse momentum ( @xmath101 ) dependent distributions and he reported on successfully combining the traditional fixed - order global pdf fits with @xmath101 resummation calculations  @xcite .",
    "this stabilizes perturbative predictions in regions of large transverse momentum where the logarithms in @xmath101 require an additional resummation .",
    "combinations of conventional and @xmath101-resummed global fits can potentially improve the determination of parton degrees of freedom entering for instance in precision @xmath77-mass measurements and higgs phenomenology .    in a different kinematical regime at low-@xmath0 ,",
    "white has conducted a global fit to scattering data with balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) resummations to nll accuracy  @xcite . in this approach , logarithms @xmath102 in the higher order coefficient and splitting",
    "functions are resummed and improved descriptions of dis data for @xmath3 and @xmath5 presently available in the kinematical region of low-@xmath0 ( and , simultaneously , of low scales @xmath1 ) are achieved .",
    "it was shown that the resummed fit improves over a standard fixed order nlo fit and predicts the turnover of the reduced cross section at high-@xmath2 consistent with the hera data .",
    "however , the question whether the small-@xmath0 logarithms are indeed the numerically dominant contribution of the higher order perturbative qcd corrections in the kinematical region considered still needs further studies .",
    "different aspects become important in the determination of pdfs and the analysis of dis data when switching to the kinematical domain of low-@xmath1 scales .",
    "the presentation of alekhin has been particularly devoted to the study low-@xmath1 dis data in the global fit of pdfs .",
    "the reasons for doing so are obvious .",
    "first of all , the dis cross section with momentum transferred @xmath103 decreases as @xmath104 thus a large part of the experimental data is collected at low-@xmath1 and also the perturbative qcd corrections are sizable in this region due to the large value of the strong coupling constant at low scales .",
    "moreover , modeling the low-@xmath1 region is important for low energy neutrino experiments and also for spin asymmetries analysis .",
    "phenomenological studies of the data can give important constraints on the value of power corrections ( higher twist ) and thereby define the region of validity for the parton model .",
    "writing for @xmath3 , @xmath105 } \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can attempt to parameterize the effect of higher twist .",
    "@xmath106 on the other hand is subject to description within perturbative qcd although target mass corrections still need to be accounted for . in conclusion , alekhin stated that the existing dis data at @xmath107 can well be described within perturbative qcd in the nnlo approximation down to @xmath108 , with the low-@xmath1 data providing valuable constraints on the @xmath71-quark distribution .",
    "the contribution of the twist-4 terms was found to be less than 10% in this kinematical region and the higher twist terms in the ratio @xmath109 of the longitudinal over the transverse cross section are generally small .",
    "the fact , that the high-@xmath1 region of lepton - nucleon scattering is typically well understood in terms of pdfs and more detailed studies at low-@xmath1 are still being conducted , have led yang to propose a unified approach to the electron- and neutrino - nucleon dis cross sections at all values of @xmath1 .",
    "improvements here would for example be very important for many neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the model presented by him tries to incorporate higher twist and target mass corrections at low scales .",
    "this is done through an effective lo qcd evolution with pdfs based on the set grv98  @xcite although with a modified scaling variable to absorb all these effects as well as missing higher orders .",
    "the predictions are in good agreement with the dis world data as well as photo - production and high - energy neutrino data .",
    "eventually , the model should also describe low energy neutrino cross sections reasonably well and would be useful for monte - carlo simulations in experiments like e.g. minos , miniboone or k2k .    with a similar motivation , the allm parameterization  @xcite of the total cross section",
    "@xmath110 has been updated by gabbert using new @xmath3 data to determine its parameters . as an upshot",
    "a fit of the world data for inclusive proton dis cross sections is available which is useful for all extractions requiring @xmath3 as input and relevant for monte carlo simulations at low-@xmath1 .      as an alternative to the standard methods of pdf global analyses rojo presented a general introduction to the neural network approach to parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "the use of neural networks provides a solution to the problem of constructing a faithful and unbiased probability distribution of pdfs based on available experimental information  @xcite .",
    "the talk emphasized the necessary techniques in order to construct a monte carlo representation of the data , to construct and evolve neural parton distributions , and to train neural networks in such a way that the correct statistical features of the data are reproduced .",
    "as a first application , a determination of the non - singlet quark distribution up to nnlo from available dis data was presented and compared with those obtained using other approaches . the obvious next step is a complete singlet analysis and the release of the first neural pdf set was announced for summer 2008 . in a similar spirit , liuti reported on first attempts to perform pdf fits with self - organizing maps , and presented lo fits as a proof of principle .",
    "a possible test of the validity of perturbative qcd evolution in a global fit to the proton structure function @xmath111 was discussed by pisano  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to probe the range of validity of the nlo and nnlo qcd evolutions of parton distributions in particular in the small-@xmath0 region using the curvature of @xmath112 as a criterion  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature to be exploited here is a positive curvature of @xmath112 which increases as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "this is a perturbatively stable prediction and turns out to be rather insensitive to the specific choice of the factorization scheme ( @xmath113 or dis ) as well .",
    "therefore , pisano argued that the curvature of @xmath112 does indeed provide a sensitive test of the range of validity of perturbative qcd evolution .",
    "the talk by zotov discussed the concept of un - integrated pdfs in the @xmath90-factorization approach , in particular its uses to obtain an un - integrated gluon distribution with @xmath90-dependence from a fit to measured structure functions @xmath3 and @xmath114 at hera  @xcite .",
    "as a critical test he then applied the results of his fit to the experimental data for observables like @xmath115 and @xmath5 , all of which are dominated by the gluon pdf .    finally , the discussions on pdfs were nicely complemented by presentations of gousset , who reported on research to quantify nuclear modifications of pdfs . for the gluon distribution , they can amount up to @xmath116 and prompt - photon production in @xmath117-@xmath118 collisions",

    "a significant discrepancy was observed for the sample with two forward jets for @xmath129 .",
    "this discrepancy may indicate an enhancement of gluon radiation compared to nlo qcd evolution , but also higher order qcd calculations for the hard scattering may improve the data description .",
    "khein presented a new zeus measurement on forward jet production in dis with a significant extension in forward region up to rapidities of @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "this measurement is expected to highlight the differences between predictions of the bfkl and dglap formalism with bfkl resulting in a larger fraction of small-@xmath0 events with forward - jets than typically present in dglap evolution to nlo in qcd .",
    "r65 mm        the measurements were presented for inclusive forward jets as well as for a forward jet accompanied by a di - jet system .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : zefj ] , nlo qcd calculations were found to be below the data , in certain regions by as much as a factor of two . amongst the monte carlo models , the color - dipole model ( cdm ) of ariande was capable of describing the data over the whole phase space .",
    "the cascade monte carlo with the j2003 set-1 and set-2 un - integrated gluon densities however failed to describe the data .",
    "therefore , these measurements can be used for further improvements by adjusting the input parameters of the cascade model .",
    "on the theory side a number of presentations were concerned with improved predictions and models for the production of forward jets at hera and multiple gluons in the low-@xmath0 kinematical region .",
    "avsar reported on efforts to further improve dipole phenomenology .",
    "starting from the mueller dipole picture , where the dipoles are assumed to interact independently , he modeled multiple scattering effects typically attributed to pomeron loops . putting particular emphasis on a monte carlo approach and adding as a new feature color - suppressed effects , he described saturation both in the evolution of dipoles and in the interactions of dipoles with a target by means of an effectively unitary formula for the amplitude .",
    "applications of the formalism for the @xmath131 total cross sections as measured by hera and @xmath132 cross sections at tevatron were shown .    on the analytical side , shoshi discussed the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation as basis for the high - energy scattering of a dipole off a nucleus / hadron in the mean field approximation  @xcite . although the bk - equation results in a geometric scaling behavior of the scattering amplitude and a roughly power - like energy dependence of the saturation scale , it is known that it needs improvements , as it misses for instance pomeron loops .",
    "shoshi reviewed recent progress in understanding the small-@xmath0 dynamics beyond the mean field approximation , guided by the natural requirements of unitarity and lorentz invariance .",
    "he pointed out relations between high - energy qcd and statistical physics inspired by dynamics of reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "as an upshot , fluctuations in gluon number from one scattering event to another lead to corrections to the geometric scaling which will be modified to diffusive scaling at large energies .",
    "he concluded that pomeron loops and fluctuations in the gluon number will strongly influence predictions for instance for diffractive scattering or the forward gluon production cross section , although it is too early to make the phenomenological consequences quantitative .",
    "lublinsky on the other hand pointed out that multi - gluon production via high energy evolution can also be modeled by improvements within the jimwlk high energy evolution .",
    "he presented results for the multi - gluon cross section in terms of a generating functional for arbitrary numbers of gluons @xmath133 , which extends the dipole approximation ( and the previously known results for single and double gluon inclusive cross sections ) and which generalizes for an arbitrary multi - gluon amplitude in terms of feynman diagrams of pomeron - like objects coupled to an external rapidity dependent field .",
    "he discussed some general properties of the expressions and suggested a line of argument to simplify the approach further .",
    "the presentations of the theory framework were nicely complemented by royon and sabio vera .",
    "the contribution by royon was concerned with the phenomenology of forward jets at hera and mueller - navelet jets at hadron colliders ( tevatron , lhc )  @xcite , both being sensitive to low-@xmath0 physics and , potentially , well described within the bfkl formalism . in particular mueller - navelet jets",
    "are ideal processes to study bfkl resummation effects with two jets having similar tranverse momenta and being separated by a large interval in rapidity .",
    "there , a typical observable to look for bfkl effects is the measurement of the azimuthal correlations between both jets .",
    "fixed order perturbative ( i.e. nlo ) qcd predictions based on dglap predict a distribution peaked towards @xmath134 as it is typical for back - to - back jets . on the other hand , multiple gluon emissions at small-@xmath0 in the bfkl formalism smoothen this distribution",
    ". fits to h1 data from hera were presented and suggestions for measurements by cdf at tevatron were made .",
    "also sabio vera  @xcite looked at the azimuthal angle correlation of mueller - navelet jets .",
    "in particular , he highlighted the need of collinear improvements in the bfkl kernel to obtain stable theory results , and better fits to the tevatron data of d@xmath69 which has analyzed data for mueller - navelet jets at @xmath135 and 1800 gev many years ago .",
    "he estimated several uncertainties and suggested improvements depending on the conformal spins .",
    "for lhc where larger rapidity differences will occur the mueller - navelet jets will be a very useful tool to investigate the importance of bfkl effects in multi - jet production in particular for the azimuthal dependence which is driven by the bfkl kernel with increasing rapidity .",
    "a lot of the success of qcd in the theoretical description of dis structure functions relies on the possibility to predict the scale dependence , which is governed by anomalous dimensions of composite wilson operators that arise in the operator product expansion of conserved currents .",
    "the anomalous dimensions reflect the symmetries of the underlying gauge theory and depend on the quantum numbers of the wilson operators such as lorentz spin .    for operators with large lorentz spin the anomalous dimensions scale logarithmically with the spin .",
    "recent higher order qcd calculations of twist - two anomalous dimensions  @xcite revealed the existence of intriguing underlying structures in the large spin expansion . in his presentation basso discussed this structure of inheritance across orders in perturbation theory for terms suppressed by powers of the lorentz spin  @xcite .",
    "he argued that it relates to the properties of a conformal field theory ( cft ) where the corresponding anomalous dimensions are functions of their conformal spin only and supplemented with well determined modifications in higher loops  @xcite .    for a more symmetric relative of qcd , the @xmath136 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym )",
    "theory , the corresponding anomalous dimensions display very interesting integrability properties , which have been reviewed in the presentation of lipatov . using an inspired observation ,",
    "he had earlier been able to obtain the @xmath136 sym results from the `` leading - transcendentality '' contributions of qcd  @xcite up to three loops . in the planar limit the @xmath136 sym theory is believed to be dual to weakly - coupled gravity in five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space .",
    "based on the ads / cft correspondence , lipatov related the pomeron at low-@xmath0 in the strong coupling limit of the gauge theory to the graviton in the weakly - coupled gravity .",
    "these investigations based on integrability and strong - weak duality offer not only great chances to improve our understanding of @xmath136 sym theory by providing us with conjectures for the exact four - loop anomalous dimension of twist - two operators  @xcite , but in the future they will hopefully also lead to new insights into qcd .",
    "many new results on nucleon structure functions and subjects related to low-@xmath0 physics were presented at this workshop , which covered both , theory and experiment . on the latter side ,",
    "the experimental contributions came not only from dis experiments ( e.g. h1 , zeus ) but also from hadron - collider experiments ( e.g. cdf , d@xmath69 ) , which we believe is a clear demonstration of the importance of our field and of the presence of lively activities . in view of the forthcoming lhc ,",
    "particular attention was paid to a further precise understanding of the qcd dynamics .",
    "this includes the gluon density at low-@xmath0 in particular , and also a more precise and robust determination of parton distribution functions in general . clearly , the progress reported here was remarkable . the first @xmath5 measurement at hera is foreseen in near future .",
    "it becomes possible with the newly developed experimental techniques reported at this workshop and is expected to give new insight into low-@xmath0 physics and the gluon density . in summary , the various efforts made , many of them being based on new and unique ideas , are likely to improve our understanding of structure functions in near future .",
    "we believe that the field continues to contribute to fruitful research in the lhc era .",
    "the authors would like to thank all the participants of our working group for their contributions as well as for the lively and useful discussions , and the organizers for the excellent organization of the workshop .",
