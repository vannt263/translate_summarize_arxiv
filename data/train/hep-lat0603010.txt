    "understanding color confinement in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the most challenging problems in quantum field theory , and also provides essential knowledge for low temperature hadron physics .",
    "there are many approaches to understand color confinement dynamics : dual superconductor scenario , center vortex model , the infrared behavior of gluon propagators , etc . have been widely studied and a large amount of information on color confinement has been accumulated .",
    "see reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite . in those scenarios , topological objects and gauge - dependent quantities ,",
    "bringing out the properties of qcd vacuum , may play an important role .",
    "a key issue is the choice of gauge in which the confinement scenario is realized .",
    "recently , there has been considerable interest in the coulomb gauge color confinement scenario .",
    "this scenario was originally discussed by gribov @xcite , and in recent years , zwanziger has advocated the importance of a color - coulomb potential in coulomb gauge for color confinement @xcite .",
    "he and his collaborators showed that , in coulomb gauge , the time - time component of gluon propagators , @xmath2 , including an instantaneous color - coulomb potential plus a noninstantaneous vacuum polarization , is invariant under renormalization @xcite .",
    "it has been found by perturbative analysis @xcite that the instantaneous part in coulomb gauge qcd causes antiscreening , while the vacuum polarization part causes screening .",
    "hence , one expects that the instantaneous color - coulomb potential represents a linearly rising behavior for large quark separations . moreover , zwanziger pointed out that there is an inequality @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 means a physical heavy - quark - antiquark potential and @xmath5 the coulomb heavy - quark potential corresponding to the instantaneous part of @xmath6 .",
    "this inequality indicates that if the physical heavy - quark potential is confining , then the coulomb heavy - quark potential is also confining .",
    "@xcite for a review .    in order to verify the coulomb gauge color confinement scenario",
    ", one needs a nonperturbative technique to describe the low - energy color confinement .",
    "therefore , nonperturbative verifications have been tried in lattice gauge simulation . in the @xmath7 lattice numerical simulation carried out by cucchieri and zwanziger @xcite ,",
    "it was found that @xmath8 is strongly enhanced at @xmath9 . in @xmath7 and @xmath0",
    "lattice simulations @xcite , furthermore , it was reported that the coulomb heavy - quark potential grows linearly at large quark separations in the confinement phase .    on the lattice ,",
    "it is essential to study the magnitude and the scaling for the string tension , which is a characteristic quantity for confinement physics .",
    "numerical lattice calculations @xcite indicate that the color - coulomb string tension has @xmath10 times larger value in comparison with the case of a gauge invariant wilson loop , as expected by @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 lattice numerical data in ref .",
    "@xcite show the possibility that an asymptotic scaling violation for the color - coulomb string tension may be less than the usual wilson loop string tension .",
    "accordingly , the dependence of the color - coulomb string tension on a gauge coupling or a lattice cutoff ought to be extensively investigated in @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .    the lattice simulations mentioned above have shown the linearity of the instantaneous color - coulomb potential at large distances in the confinement regions . at the same time , the lattice calculations at finite temperature in the deconfinement phase indicate that the coulomb string tension remains after the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase transition @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is that the color - coulomb potential , determined by the spatial - like and time ( temperature ) independent faddeev - popov operator , is not sensitive to the system temperature .",
    "in addition , we note that the potential obtained from a spatial wilson loop above @xmath12 behaves as a linearly rising function @xcite .",
    "both the color - coulomb and the spatial wilson potentials have a common feature that they are defined by spatial variables .",
    "however , the higher temperature lattice simulations than the previous calculations @xcite are indispensable .",
    "nevertheless , the noninstantaneous retarded part with the vacuum polarization still gives a color - screened potential @xcite .",
    "in coulomb gauge qcd there are no unphysical degrees of freedom for gauge fields ; namely , coulomb gauge is a physical gauge .",
    "in contrast , lorentz covariant gauges generate a negative spectral function due to the indefinite metric of fock space .",
    "this is very convenient on discussing a physical hadron , and a lot of attempts have been made to construct models based on the coulomb gauge hamiltonian to describe color confinement @xcite and hadrons @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will perform more extensive lattice qcd studies on the coulomb gauge confinement scenario comparing with the previous calculation @xcite . in the confinement phase , we investigate the scaling behavior of the color - coulomb string tension by varying a lattice cutoff or a coupling constant @xmath13 . in the deconfinement phase ,",
    "we discuss the relation between the thermal color - coulomb string tensions , which are calculated at high temperatures , @xmath14 , and the magnetic scaling that is believed to dominate the high temperature qcd . in sec .",

    "iii , we give the definition of the partial - length polyakov line correlator@xcite to evaluate the instantaneous part .",
    "section iv is devoted to show the numerical results .",
    "section v gives conclusions .",
    "the construction of the partition function in coulomb gauge through the faddeev - popov technique and the derivation of the instantaneous color - coulomb potential were done in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian of qcd in coulomb gauge can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the transverse electric field , the magnetic field and the color charge density , respectively .",

    "therefore , if the potential @xmath24 is a linearly rising potential for large quark separations , then color confinement is attributed to an enhancement of the low - lying mode of fp eigenvalues @xcite .",

    "thus we find that the instantaneous potential @xmath41 is a confining potential .",

    "such tendency was also observed in the @xmath7 lattice simulations @xcite .",

    "the instantaneous color - coulomb part gives a confining potential .",

    "however , in the deconfinement phase , it is known that the potential @xmath84 is a linearly rising potential at large distances rather than a color - screened potential .",
    "consequently , the nonvanishing spatial string tension , @xmath86 , exists even in the deconfinement phase .    in a series of studies on the thermal spatial wilson loop ,",

    "thus , the magnetic scaling somewhat has a nonperturbative origin and is closely relevant to longer range physics than the electric scale .",
    "the infrared sensitivity in tqcd is known to survive in the high temperature limit ( @xmath89 ) through the argument of 3-dimensional reduction @xcite .",
    "this approach enables us to obtain the effective theory that is defined by integrating out a nondynamical heavy mode in the high temperature limit ; this theory proves that the long - range properties of tqcd are dominated by the magnetic scaling .      to obtain the thermal color - coulomb string tension @xmath90 for the deconfining phase , we employed an ansatz of the coulomb plus linear terms .",

    "the thermal color - coulomb string tensions do not vanish for those temperatures , the values of which increase with temperature , and the rate of increase of the temperature is more rapid than those of the string tension @xmath90 .",

    "this situation is very similar to the case of the spatial wilson loop at finite temperature as reviewed in the previous section .",
    "therefore , we shall describe these data by the magnetic scaling : @xmath94 and the running coupling depending on the system temperature , @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath58 are free parameters for fitting . using the data for @xmath75 we obtained the fitted result , listed in table [ tab2 ] , and",

    "if one requires more precise data for magnetic ( spatial ) or long - range quantities , which are expected to be sensitive to the volume size @xcite , then the computation on the larger lattice is necessary .",

    "the variation of color - coulomb string tension on the lattice cutoff is also found to be small although we are still far from the continuum limit .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with those obtained by the same analysis in the @xmath7 lattice calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite . note that if one employs the gluon propagator itself to extract the instantaneous part , then the value of the color - coulomb string tension tends to become smaller than that measured by using the polyakov loop correlator as used in the present work @xcite .",

    "@xcite that the emergence of a large string tension is not ruled out .    even in the deconfinement phase , it is observed that the color - coulomb string tension remains finite .",
    "this may be an acceptable result because the instantaneous part is constructed in terms of the faddeev - popov matrix with the derivative operator for the spatial direction ; i.e. , the instantaneous part is not sensitive to the system temperature .",

    "is caused by the instantaneous part .    in both confinement and deconfinement phases , there is no qualitative change in the behavior of the instantaneous part .",
    "therefore , it is evident that the color - coulomb string tension obtained from that potential is not an order parameter for the qgp phase transition .",
    "it is found that the thermal behavior of the color - coulomb string tension is understood by assuming the magnetic scaling , @xmath112 , which is actually identified as an infrared regulator or a pole mass of the spatial gluon propagator .",

    "firstly , we conclude that the color - coulomb string tension in the deconfinement phase is a kind of the thermal quantity and survives in the high temperature limit as being the same as the case of the spatial wilson loop . secondly , because the magnetic scaling originates in the infrared sensitivity of the thermal qcd , in the case of coulomb gauge , the instantaneous part of the gluon propagators reveals such infrared behavior .    in the coulomb gauge confinement scenario discussed by gribov and zwanziger @xcite ,",
    "the linearity of the instantaneous part for large quark separations is conjectured to be ascribed to a singularity emerging from the gauge configurations with a low - lying eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov operator .",

    "the @xmath0 lattice study along this line is also being undertaken .    in the present work",
    ", we focused the calculation of the instantaneous part only and did not deal with the vacuum polarization ( retarded ) part , being of little significance in the view of understanding color confinement in coulomb gauge .",
    "however , the vital change concerning the qgp phase transition seems to be relevant to the vacuum polarization part , the role of which ought to be discussed in a subsequent study .    in a phenomenological point of view , it is interesting that there remains the thermal string tension . if this is regarded as the indication that confining features survive above the critical temperature , then this observation may provide some insight into understanding the strongly correlated qgp .",
