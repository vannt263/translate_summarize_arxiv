    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite is the only cryptographic protocol that allows to distribute a secure key between two distant parties with a security guarantee that holds against a computationally unbounded adversary .",
    "qkd has attracted considerable interest over the past thirty years , with theoretical breakthrough regarding our understanding of qkd security as well as tremendous progress on the experimental side @xcite .",
    "targeting real - world applications , fully functional prototypes as well as commercial systems have now been available from more than 10 years and deployed in test and production environments @xcite .",
    "conversely , qkd has become the most advanced quantum communication technology , with a fast - paced increase in the demonstrated performances : a thousand - fold increase of the key rates and distance limitations that have improved from about 50 km to more than 100 km @xcite .",
    "most of the effort on qkd system design and experimental demonstrations have however so far been realized on dark fiber @xcite .",
    "this restricts the deployability of qkd to a limited number of scenarios where the barriers associated with dark fiber availability and price can both be overcome . on the other hand , wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) allows to share a single optical fiber to transport multiple optical channels using different wavelengths .",
    "wdm compatibility of quantum and classical communications would allow to deploy qkd on lit fiber .",
    "this would boost the compatibility of quantum communications with existing optical infrastructures and lead to a significant improvement in terms of cost - effectiveness and addressable market for qkd .",
    "however , coexistence with intense classical channels raises new challenges for qkd .",
    "the optical power used on optical classical channels is orders of magnitude higher than for quantum communication .",
    "multiplexing classical and quantum signals on a single fiber can result in very important additional noise for the quantum communication , due to insufficient isolation or to optical non - linear effects @xcite .",
    "coping with such noise is in general a major problem for qkd systems and filtering techniques are needed to improve the ratio between quantum signal and wdm - induced noise .",
    "the implementation of this filtering can result in additional losses and severely impact the performance of qkd .",
    "this is in particular the case for systems that rely on spectrally wide - band single photon detectors@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate in this article that continuous variable - qkd ( cv - qkd ) systems , relying on coherent detectors - that are spectrally selective by design - can exhibit superior tolerance to wdm - induced noise .    pioneering work on qkd and",
    "wavelength division multiplexing has been performed at the very early days of qkd research by paul townsend and coworkers @xcite , with one classical channel at 1550 nm multiplexed with a quantum channel at 1300 nm .",
    "this corresponds to a coarse wavevelength division multiplexing ( cwdm ) configuration , that has been studied in several other works @xcite .",
    "the large spectral separation the quantum and the classical channels presents the advantage of reducing the amount of noise due to raman scattering ( that is approximately 200 nm wide ) onto the quantum channel .",
    "cwdm qkd integration configuration has however several limitations : it can only accommodate shorter distance ( due to the higher attenuation for qkd at 1300 nm ) and the coexistence is limited to a small number ( below 8) of classical channels due to the large inter - channel spacing in cwdm .",
    "one could thus use this configuration in priority in the context of access networks , where it seems best suited @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if qkd is to be transported over long - distance links ( beyond 50 km ) and in coexistence with a large number classical channels , which is the case in core or wide - area optical networks , then dense division wavelength multiplexing ( dwdm ) is required .",
    "dwdm compatibility , i.e. the capacity to coexist with standard optical channels , all multiplexed in the c band , with relatively narrow channel spacing ( from 1.6 nm to 0.2 nm ) , is the focus of the present article .",
    "dwdm compatibility of qkd has initially been studied in the work of peters et .",
    "al.@xcite , where raman noise was identified as the main impairment for links longer than a few km .",
    "a coexistence test of qkd with two forward - propagating classical channel and a total input power of 0.3 mw has been performed . despite this input power below typical optical network specifications and",
    "the use of some filtering , qkd could not be operated beyond 25 km .",
    "more recently , several new dwdm compatibility experiments have been performed , with discrete variable qkd ( dv - qkd ) systems and more efficient filtering techniques . in @xcite , 4 classical channels where multiplexed with a dv - qkd system and 50 km operation was demonstrated .",
    "however , the input power of the classical channels was attenuated below -15dbm , to the smallest possible power compatible with the sensitivity limit of the optical receiver ( -26dbm ) .",
    "this technique was also used in @xcite with an input power limited down to -18.5dbm and in addition the use of a temporal filtering technique developed in @xcite to obtain a range of 90 km .",
    "the extended working range for dv - qkd coexistence with dwdm channels demonstrated in @xcite is of practical interest .",
    "however , these demonstrations have been performed with strongly attenuated classical channels , more that 15db below the standard level of optical input power commonly used in existing optical network .",
    "this indicates the difficulty of integrating dv - qkd in optical networks in coexistence with standard optical power ( around 0dbm ) .",
    "coexistence of dv - qkd with 0dbm channels has however recently been demonstrated over 25 km @xcite , but it requires additional use of fine - tuned time and spectral filtering .",
    "we demonstrate in the present article that the use of cv - qkd could be advantageous in order to deploy qkd in dwdm coexistence with standard optical channels : we have shown that cv - qkd can coexist with classical channels whose cumulated power could be as high as 11.5dbm at 25 km .",
    "we have also demonstrated qkd operation ( with a key rate of 0.49kbit / s ) at 75 km in coexistence with a -3dbm channel .",
    "this stronger coexistence capability can be obtained without any additional filtering and could be of significant advantage in many practical situations related to qkd integration in standard optical networks .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section * ii * the general principle of cv - qkd is given .",
    "section * iii * analyzes the different noise sources of photons generated by classical channels on the quantum channel in a dwdm network context . in section",
    "* iv * , we characterize experimentally the impact of the main source of noise : spontaneous anti - stockes raman scattering .",
    "we then describe in section * v * the experiments we have performed to test the dwdm coexistence of a cv - qkd channel with an intense ( 0 - 8mw ) classical dwdm channel .",
    "the analysis of the results and a comparison with previous works are proposed in section * vi * , along with a discussion of the integration of cv - qkd in wdm - pon networks . finally , concluding remarks are given in section * vii*.",
    "the gaussian - modulated coherent state ( gmcs ) protocol @xcite was the first proposed cv - qkd protocol that could be implemented with coherent states ( and not squeezed states ) @xcite , making it a attractive candidate for practical developments .",
    "there are other cv - qkd protocols proposed based on squeezed or entangled states@xcite . however , the security analysis of gmcs protocol is moreover firmly established , with a security proof that holds against collective @xcite and coherent attacks @xcite , and that can be extended to the composable security framework @xcite .",
    "it is probably the cv - qkd protocol that has been most widely studied and implemented , and we will also use it in our experimental implementation , which will ease the comparison of our results on dwdm coexistence with previous results for cv - qkd implemented over dark fiber .    in the gmcs ,",
    "alice encodes information on coherent states of light , by realizing a gaussian modulation on both quadratures @xmath0 with the same variance @xmath1 .",
    "this signal travels through the public quantum channel , that can be characterized , in the context of the asymptotic security against collective attack ( which we will adopt in this article ) , by two parameters : the transmission @xmath2 ( in power ) and the excess noise @xmath3 ( equivalent excess noise at the input ) . at reception ,",
    "bob randomly chooses to measure one of the two quadratures , @xmath4 or @xmath5 , with a homodyne detector and publicly announce which quadrature he has measured .",
    "alice and bob will then reveal part of their data to estimate the channel parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "provided the estimated parameters are compatible with secure key generation , which can be learned from the security proof , then key distillation , i.e. error correction followed by privacy amplification , will be performed on the non - revealed data to generate key .    by symmetry",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that bob has measured the quadrature @xmath4 , and thus that alice and bob share respectively the correlated continuous variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath8 .    to perform parameter estimation , i.e. estimate @xmath2 and @xmath3 and then secret key rate ,",
    "alice and bob reveal part of their data and can make use of eq.1 - 4@xcite : @xmath9    here @xmath10 - the transmission efficiency of bob and @xmath11 - the variance of the electronic noise are calibrated values , evaluated offline and stable during an experiment . eq.2 and 3 are therefore sufficient to evaluate @xmath2 and @xmath3 , provided shot noise variance @xmath12 is calibrated , which needs to be done by an auxiliary measurement , corresponding to eq.4 .",
    "shot noise variance calibration is performed by shining only the local oscillator on the homodyne detector and measuring the variance of the homodyne detector output . however , as we shall discuss later in the text , shot noise variance can not in general be assumed to be strictly constant , and must be sampled periodically .",
    "shot noise calibration is performed by nullifying the signal entering the input port , for example by shutting down all sources of incoming light or by closing the signal optical port on bob side . throughout the article ,",
    "all value homogeneous to quadrature variances will implicitly be expressed in shot noise units ( 1 shot noise unit = 1 @xmath12 ) .    during the experiment , and for each transmission distance , @xmath1 is chosen in order to optimize the secure key rate under collective attacks @xcite .",
    "the optimal @xmath1 value is determined by measuring system excess noise for a range of @xmath1 and then by selecting the @xmath1 value that gives rise to the maximum key rate . in our experimental system , assuming 95@xmath13 of reconciliation efficiency , the optimal value of @xmath1 was found to be 3.5@xmath12 at 25 km and 2@xmath12 for 50 km and 75 km .",
    "we have seen in the previous section how excess noise @xmath3 as well as the transmission @xmath2 of the quantum channel could be estimated in the context of cv - qkd .    in this section",
    "we would like to make an ab - initio analysis of the impact of intense dwdm classical channels on the excess noise and thus on the performance of a cv - qkd system . to perform this analysis",
    ", we consider a relatively generic optical network environment in which the cv - qkd system could be deployed : the cv - qkd system is multiplexed with forward ( from alice to bob ) and backward ( reverse ) propagating dwdm channels , by using mux and demux passive components .",
    "in addition , an erbium amplifier is used to regenerated the classical channels in the forward direction , cf fig.[figure : dwdmsetup ]        [ [ assumptions ] ] assumptions + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we want to assess the amount of noise associated to several different process that can contribute to the excess noise , in order to identify the main source(s ) of noise . for this",
    "we will make the following assumptions :    * we consider multiplexed quantum and classical optical communication through an optical fiber of 25 km of length .",
    "* attenuation coefficient , @xmath14 , of the optical fiber is taken as 0.2db / km . *",
    "the clock rate of the cv - qkd system is 1 mhz , and the temporal length of the homodyne detection mode ( duration of local oscillator pulses ) is of @xmath15ns . *",
    "the wavelengths of the quantum channel and of the dwdm classical channels are distinct , located in the c band .",
    "* the mean number of photon in the local oscillator mode is @xmath16 .",
    "* the launch power of classical channels is of 0dbm ( 1mw ) . *",
    "dwdm multiplexer and de - multiplexer ( mux and demux ) have a 100ghz ( 0.8 nm ) separation between channels . *",
    "mux and demux are assumed to have -40db of isolation between two adjacent channels , -80db isolation between non - adjacent channels and negligible insertion loss . * as a simplification , @xmath10 the transmission efficiency of bob , is taken as unity in the evaluations ( this constitutes a worst case assumptions for the estimation of excess noise at bob ) .",
    "based on the above practical assumptions , we have studied quantitatively the amount of excess noise that could be due to different noise processes .",
    "we will moreover compare these different potential sources of excess noise to the `` system excess noise '' of a cv - qkd system ( i.e. systematic excess noise that is due to the cv - qkd system itself , for example because of a limited common mode rejection ratio of the homodyne detection ) .",
    "system excess noise is typically larger that @xmath17 @xmath12 at bob , which corresponds to one of the smallest experimental value reported so far @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we will consider that noise processes leading to excess noise significantly below @xmath17 @xmath12 can be neglected .",
    "the analysis of noise contributions that can be neglected in our experiment is given in appendix a.    as analyzed in @xcite , noise photons impinging on the signal port of the homodyne detection can either be matched or unmatched with the local oscillator spatio - temporal mod .",
    "as the local oscillator contains @xmath18 photons per mode , this implies that the photocurrent associated to one matched photon is 80db larger than for one unmatched photon , which illustrates the `` built - in '' filtering property associated to coherent detection .",
    "one point to mention here is that the amount of noise induced by matched and unmatched photons on homodyne detector is independent of the quantum signal whether it is realized with coherent or squeezed or entangled states",
    ". we can moreover relate , under the realistic assumption that the statistics of matched noise is chaotic @xcite , the excess noise ( at bob side , i.e. at the output ) @xmath19 to the mean number of matched noise photons @xmath20 impinging on bob device by : @xmath21    as already notice in @xcite , spontaneous raman scattering ( srs ) is the dominant source of noise for qkd in a dwdm environment , as long as the fiber length is beyond a few km ( which is the case in our experimental setup ) .",
    "it is an inelastic scattering process during which scattered photons get converted into photons of either longer or shorter wavelength , respectively called stokes and anti - stokes scattering .",
    "anti - stokes scattering is less probable than stokes .",
    "therefore , in order to minimize the amount of noise due to raman scattering , it is preferable to place the quantum channel at a wavelength lower than the ones of the classical channels . we will assume here that this design rule has been followed so that we only need to focus on the effect of spontaneous anti - stokes raman scattering ( sasrs ) photons on cv - qkd system .",
    "in the following , we will analyze the impact of sasrs on cv - qkd .",
    "the mean number @xmath22 of noise photons generated by sasrs per spatio - temporal and polarization mode , and matched with the homodyne detection mode , at the input of bob s qkd system can be expressed as  @xcite :    @xmath23   \\label{raman}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath24 is the input power of the classical channel sent either in the forward or backward direction , @xmath25 is the wavelength of the quantum channel , @xmath26 is plank s constant , @xmath27 is the speed of light , @xmath28 is the raman scattering coefficient , @xmath29 is transmittance of demux ( add - drop module ) place at bob side , @xmath30 is the channel distance in km and @xmath14 is fiber attenuation coefficient . in equations",
    "eq.[raman ] , the factor @xmath31 is due to the polarization mode selectivity of local oscillator .",
    "we can then use eq.[photontonoise ] to evaluate the excess noise at the output and rescale it by @xmath32 to obtain the expression for @xmath33 , the excess noise at the input , induced by spontaneous anti - stokes raman scattering .",
    "@xmath34    from this expression , we can evaluate that a 0dbm forward propagating channel would induce an excess noise of @xmath35 @xmath12 over a 25 km cv - qkd link ( assuming @xmath36/km.nm and @xmath37 ) while the excess noise induced by a 0dbm backward propagating channel is found to be @xmath38 @xmath12 . comparing this excess noise to other noise sources listed in appendix a",
    ", it can be seen that raman scattering is the dominant source of noise . in the next section",
    ", we will experimentally characterize sasrs noise .",
    "in order to validate the prominence of raman scattering as source of noise , we have conducted experiments to estimate the value of the raman scattering coefficient , @xmath28 , and to validate experimentally the validity of eq.[xiinsrs ] in order to predict the amount of excess noise induced by spontaneous raman scattering on homodyne detector .    0.4   in forward ( dotted ) and backward ( solid ) directions.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.6   in forward ( dotted ) and backward ( solid ) directions.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig.[figure : ramansetup ] .",
    "classical channel at 1550.12 nm ( itu channel 34 ) is multiplexed either in forward of backward direction into the fibre through add and drop modules ( adm1/adm2 ) and we perform noise measurement with a homodyne detector .",
    "add and drop modules are dwdm elements that allow to multiplex / demultiplex ( add / drop ) a particular wavelength to / from an optical fiber channel on which it is placed .",
    "adms exhibits comparatively less insertion loss ( @xmath39 0.5db ) than wdm modules ( @xmath392db ) .",
    "moreover , we have obtained cross channels isolation of -46db between adjacent channels and -96db between non - adjacent channels .",
    "the wavelength of the classical channel is scanned over the entire c band ( 1530 nm - 1565 nm ) with 5mw input power .",
    "raman scattered photons at the wavelength 1531.12 nm ( itu channel 58 ) of the quantum channel are collected through the add / drop port of adm2 .",
    "we have characterized the raman scattering coefficient , @xmath28 , by measuring the intensity of backscattered photons , from a fiber spool of 25 km , using a power meter ( model nova ii , ophir optronics ) at the point a in fig .",
    "[ figure : ramansetup ] and an adm of bandwidth 0.8 nm .",
    "we can use eq.[raman ] to relate the power of raman backscattering to the value of the coefficient @xmath28 , whose measurement ( that depends on the wavelength of the classical channel ) varies from @xmath40/km.nm . to @xmath41/km.nm and agrees with that given in  @xcite .    for the characterization of the excess noise induced by raman scattered photons on the homodyne measurement",
    "we have used a specific technique to evaluate both total noise and shot noise variance .",
    "an amplitude modulator ( am ) is used to close the signal port of homodyne detector during the shot noise measurement and is kept open for total noise measurement . in order to minimize the effect of homodyne output drift , shot noise and total noise measurements are taken in every alternative intervals . forward and backward",
    "raman noise variance are measured for different fiber channel lengths with various classical channel launch power .",
    "results are as shown in fig.[figure : ramanfwdbwdcalib ] .",
    "as we can see , in the forward scattering direction raman noise reaches a maximum at @xmath42 21 km , where @xmath14 = 0.046 is the fiber attenuation per km , and then decreases along with classical channel power . in the backward direction , noise reaches a saturation level as the distance increases .",
    "the experimental data is fitted using respective parts of eq.[raman ] and found in good agreement with the theory .",
    "to experimentally measure the excess noise induced by multiplexed dwdm channels , we have inserted a cv - qkd system in a dwdm test - bed , and have used a dedicated scheme for excess noise acquisition , minimizing system noise associated to temporal drifts , so that dwdm - induced noise could be resolved with enough precision .",
    "we start by a description of our cv - qkd set - up and then detail our acquisition scheme .",

    "these pulses are split on a 90/10 beam splitter into local oscillator and signal pulses .",
    "signal pulses are strongly attenuated ( to the level of a few photons per pulse ) and their quadratures are gaussian modulated using amplitude and phase modulators , with quadrature variance @xmath1 .",
    "local oscillator and signal are time multiplexed ( 200ns delay ) and polarization multiplexed , before being sent to bob through the fiber channel . at reception , on bob side , signal and local oscillator pulses are polarization and time de - multiplexed .",
    "detailed description of the setup is given in @xcite .",
    "the quadrature information is retrieved by using a balanced homodyne detector of electronic noise -25db below the shot noise .",
    "the intensity of the local oscillator is set in order to have a mean number of @xmath18 photons per pulse at bob .",
    "the input voltage range of the data acquisition card is set sufficiently low ( @xmath431 volts ) to obtain a good resolution for the homodyne output measurement , which reduces the electronic noise down to 0.3@xmath13 of shot noise .",
    "such setting however could open a door for recently proposed saturation attack on cv - qkd system @xcite , but we will not be considering this issue , or other issue related to side - channel attacks here .    to perform shot noise measurement ( eq.4 )",
    "alice blocks the signal pulses at emission with her amplitude modulator while a second amplitude modulator , placed on the classical channel ( in green on fig.[figure : setup ] ) is used to block the optical input of the multiplexed classical channel . on the other hand ,",
    "when both quantum and classical signals are multiplexed on the same fiber , we say that the `` total noise '' variance ( eq.4 ) is being measured .",
    "in order to limit the impact of statistical fluctuation in variance estimation @xcite , windows of size @xmath18 pulses were used to estimate the quadrature measurement variances both for shot noise and for total noise .",

    "it would be possible to select a quantum channel wavelength close to the classical channel , as illustrated in @xcite , in order to further minimize the raman induced noise .",
    "both channels are multiplexed and de - multiplexed to and from the optical fiber spool by means of adms . an additional bandpass filter ( not shown in fig .",

    "we have opted for a conservative approach and have considered that the losses associated to the adms are part of the fiber channel and not of the qkd system .",
    "this approach is conservative because it does not require to assume that the adms insertion loss are calibrated ( and this calibration trusted ) .",

    "is on the other hand to use smaller data blocks so that the noise induced by the relative drift becomes negligible at this timescale . using this principle ,",

    "we in particular expect the excess noise to be a linear function of the launch power .",

    "one important thing to point at here is the yield ( secure key bit per qkd signal pulse ) of cv - qkd system in wdm environment . in our experiment with 0dbm classical channel over 25 km",
    "the yield is of @xmath54 bits / pulse which is two order of magnitude higher than the recently reported , @xmath55 bits / pulse , dv - qkd experiment @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the latest dv - qkd system can be operated at ghz - clock rate , which has still not yet been demonstrated with cv - qkd systems , currently operated at mhz clock rate , even though no fundamental barrier prevents to upgrade it to 100 mhz if not ghz clock rate .        [ [ comparison - with - dv - qkd ] ] comparison with dv - qkd + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to illustrate the strong dwdm coexistence capacity of cv - qkd , we have made a comparative study with previously reported dv - qkd experiments  @xcite , and displayed in fig.[figure : comparewdmworks ] a comparison of the reachable distance of qkd , as a function of the classical multiplexed power ( in cwdm or dwdm , see caption ) . in fig.6 , the data points for cv - qkd indicate the maximum reachable distance ( null key threshold ) . the key rates corresponding to experimental points taken with our cv - qkd system and displayed on fig .",
    "6 are : 12b / s for 25 km ; 8b / s for 50 km and 9b / s for 75 km .",
    "note that dv - qkd performances mentioned in fig.6 have also been acquired very close to the null key threshold .",
    "one important thing to note that the different results mentioned in this comparison do not all rely on a unified security analysis .",
    "key rates are derived for security proofs valid against collective attacks in @xcite , individual attacks in @xcite and general attacks in@xcite , while among these references , only @xcite takes finite - size effects into account .",
    "as previously explained , we have considered collective attacks and have taken finite - key effects into account for the cv - qkd secure key derivations associated to our experiments .",
    "it can be seen that cv - qkd can reach longer transmission distances for a given classical channel launch power .",
    "conversely , for a given transmission distance , cv - qkd can tolerate noise from multiple classical channels with typical transmission power of 0dbm .",
    "this is particularly true for 25 km and 50 km transmission distance as shown in fig.[figure : comparewdmworks ] .",
    "cv - qkd can also be deployed in coexistence with classical channels of unprecedent power levels- thanks to the mode selection property of its coherent detection .",
    "this gives cv - qkd an advantage for the integration into different optical network architectures and in particular into access networks .",
    "such integration requires , in general , capacity for qkd to co - exist with classical channels of several dbm of power . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure : comparewdmworks ] , strong co - existence of cv - qkd would allow its integration into different standard passive optical networks such as , for example , gigabit pon , 10g - pon and wdm / tdm pon@xcite .        [ [ optimization - of - classical - channel - allocation ] ] optimization of classical channel allocation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the light of the experimental results and the promising perspective defined for cv - qkd integration in optical networks , we have simulated how we could effectively integrate cv - qkd in some wdm passive optical network architectures ( wdm - pon ) .",
    "to this effect , we have applied a simple optimization routine to the integration of cv - qkd system into wdm - pon , that allowed us to propose classical channel allocations by minimizing the excess noise induced on cv - qkd .    for a typical access network distance of 25 km ,",
    "we have considered classical channel allocation in the c band and found that cv - qkd could coexist with 5 pairs of classical channels ( with nominal wdm - pon channel launch power : 2dbm in forward and 1dbm backward ) .",
    "optimization(at a give transmission distance ) is performed by choosing sequentially the position of the classical channel that maximize the additional excess noise on qkd , up to the maximum number of channels compatible with a positive secret key rate .",
    "if the detector sensitivity on the classical channels allows , it might even be realistic to reduce the classical channel power below the nominal specifications of a wdm - pon network , while still being able to operate the classical channels .",
    "we have studied the impact of this hypothesis in fig.[figure : optimallocation ] .",
    "we can see for example that 14 pairs of channels ( each with -10dbm launch power ) could be multiplexed with one cv - qkd channel at 50 km and while 2 pairs of channels ( also with -10dbm launch power ) could coexist with cv - qkd at 75 km .",
    "these simulation results clearly indicate that the strong coexistence capacity of cv - qkd with wdm multiplexed classical channels is likely to play an important role in the integration of qkd into optical networks .",
    "the success of emerging optical network technologies relies for a large part on their ability to be seamlessly integrated into existing infrastructures .",
    "we have demonstrated the successful co - existence capability of cv - qkd intense ( around 0 dbm ) classical channels , in a dwdm configuration . we have characterized and studied the influence of the main source of noise : raman scattering and have demonstrated experimentally that cv - qkd can coexist with a dwdm channel intensity as high as 11.5dbm , while positive key rate could also be obtained with a -3dbm forward dwdm multiplexed classical channel at 75 km .",
    "it can be also seen that cv - qkd , benefitting from a built - in single mode filtering ( associated with the coherent detection ) is less affected by dwdm - induced noise photons that the dv - qkd systems tested so far in this regime , and can therefore reach longer transmission distances for a given dwdm classical channel launch power .",
    "these experimental results indicate that cv - qkd , and more generally coherent communications operated at the shot noise limit are a promising technology in order to jointly operated quantum and classical communications on the same optical fiber network , and can therefore play an important role for the development of quantum communications over existing optical networks .",
    "we thank grard mouret for his very helpful support for the design of the electronics of the experiment .",
    "we also thank paul jouguet and sbastien kunz - jacques for useful discussions on cv - qkd noise evaluation and zhiliang yuan for suggesting corrections in fig.6 .",
    "this research was supported by the anr , through the project quantum - wdm ( anr-12-emma-0034 ) , by the direccte ile - de - france through the qvpn ( feder-41402 ) project and by the european union through the q - cert ( fp7-people-2009- iapp ) project .",
    "the excess noise from different sources is calculated based on the assumptions given in section[sec : noisesources ] .",
    "while spontaneous raman scattering constitutes the main source of noise , we assess here the impact of other potential sources of noise and show that they can be neglected in our experiment , being significantly below the limit of the smallest observable system excess noise of @xmath56 @xmath12 .",
    "* imperfect isolation of demux : due to limited isolation between the channels of demux , light from forward classical channels can leak into the quantum channel and induce excess noise on the qkd system .",
    "sufficient cross channel isolation usually permits to eliminate this noise . with the numerical assumptions listed above ( in particular 0 dbm launch power of classical channels and realistic isolation for mux and demux )",
    ", we can evaluate that the excess noise due to unmatched leakage photons from non - adjacent channel would lead to an excess noise of @xmath57 @xmath12 .",
    "channel isolation is typically smaller for adjacent channel , but the excess noise would be in this case approximately of @xmath58 @xmath12 . * rayleigh scattering ( rs )",
    ": rs is an elastic scattering process , that can in particular lead to back - reflection in an optical fiber ( rayleigh backscattering ) .",
    "the wavelength of the scattered light is identical to that of the incident light .",
    "rayleigh backscattering can be a major concern for the design of two - way dv - qkd systems deployed over dark fiber@xcite . in the context of cv - qkd implemented in wdm environment however",
    "the isolation of demux will act as a efficient protection , as illustrated in the previous item . indeed , since the intensity of backscattered photon will be in all case very low compared to the channel launch power itself , the noise contribution due to rayleigh scattering will be negligible . *",
    "stimulated brillouin scattering ( sbs ) : in sbs , an incident photon is converted into a scattered photon of higher wavelength and a phonon . due to phase matching consideration , the scattered photon propagates in the backward direction . at 1550 nm ,",
    "the scattered photon is shifted by @xmath598.8pm , which means it remains in the same dwdm channel  @xcite and can not generate a significant cross - talk into the quantum channel .",
    "* guided acoustic wave brillouin scattering ( gawbs ) can be another possible source of noise in high bandwidth qkd system , where photons from local oscillator pulse scatter to the signal pulse , despite the isolation ( temporal multiplexing ) and contribute to the excess noise .",
    "however , the spectral width of gawbs is of approximately 600 mhz @xcite and the associated noise contribution be essentially cut with a homodyne detection operating around 1 mhz . moreover",
    "the isolation associated to the temporal multiplexing between signal and lo used in our system ( 200 ns ) is much larger than what can be done in a 1 ghz system . as a consequence , while the effect of gawbs can become a problem with high - speed system ( 1ghz ) bandwidth @xcite , it is negligible in our experiment operated at 1 mhz repetition rate . *",
    "four wave mixing ( fwm ) : when two or more pumps of different frequency co - propagate in the optical fiber , by the third order non - linear process , involving the non - linear coefficient @xmath60 , additional frequencies are generated .",
    "depending on the wavelength configuration , fwm - generated photons may fall in channels on the dwdm grid adjacent to the classical pump channels  @xcite . considering a separation of 100ghz between two 0dbm classical channels ,",
    "the power generated into a third channel ( that could be the quantum channel ) is approximately -81dbm . that would lead to an excess noise of @xmath61 @xmath12 . *",
    "amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) : erbium doped fiber amplifiers ( edfa ) used in optical networks generate a wide - band optical noise due to spontaneous emission .",
    "noise photons are generated over the entire c band and thus affect all the dwdm channels , an in particular the quantum channel .",
    "considering an amplification gain of 100 of the edfa and following the analysis of @xcite , the excess noise due to ase , filtered by the mux at alice side ( whose side function is to act as a bandpass filter ) is found to be approximately of @xmath62 . * sideband photons : photons generated by the classical channel laser at the wavelength of the quantum channel are a source of matched noise photons . however , the power of these sideband photons is typically -40db below the main mode for typical semiconductor dfb lasers .",
    "like for ase , the wavelength bandpass filtering property of mux can moreover reduce this noise to a great extent . for example , side band photons from a 0dbm channel adjacent to quantum channel would lead to an amount of excess noise of @xmath63 @xmath12 .",
    "* cross phase modulation ( xpm ) : in cross phase modulation , power fluctuations of the classical channels affect the refractive index of the fiber and it induces phase fluctuations on the quantum channel . in a typical cv - qkd set - up quantum signal and local oscillator are time - multiplexed and may thus experience different phase modulation due to xpm .",
    "their relative phase drift can be expressed as @xmath64 , where , @xmath65 is the intensity dependent refractive index of the fiber , @xmath66 is the wavelength of classical channel , @xmath67 is the effective area and @xmath68 the effective length of the fiber .",
    "@xmath69 ( respectively @xmath70 ) is the launch power of the classical channel as it temporally overlaps with the signal ( respectively with the local oscillator ) pulses .",
    "the phase drift creates an amount of excess noise of @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "considering the less favorable case , where the classical power would overlap temporal maximally with the quantum signal pulses ( @xmath72 ) , and not at all with the local oscillator ( @xmath73 ) , which could correspond to a situation where the classical channel is operated exactly at the repletion rate ( 1mhz in our case ) of the quantum channel , with a on - off keying type of amplitude modulation and a mean power of 0 dbm .",
    "then the xpm excess noise contribution after 25 km is found to be @xmath74 @xmath12 and would saturate to @xmath75 .",
