    "the attribution of mass renormalization to correlation effects , a concept widely used in the literature  @xcite , is ill - defined : it depends on an arbitrary reference , e.g. the lda .",

    "as a measure of the discrepancy we provide the rigid shift of the fermi energy that would lead the computed area to equate the measured one ( see table ii in main text ) .",

    "<S> we present a detailed study of local and non - local correlations in the electronic structure of elemental transition metals carried out by means of the quasiparticle self - consistent gw ( qs__gw _ _ ) and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent high resolution arpes and haas - van alphen data of two typical transition metal systems ( fe and ni ) are used as case study . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) we find that the properties of fe are very well described by qs__gw__. agreement with cyclotron and very clean arpes measurements is excellent , provided that final - state scattering is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes the exceptional reliability of qs__gw _ _ also in metallic systems . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) nonetheless qs__gw _ _ alone is not able to provide an adequate description of the ni arpes data due to strong local spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we surmount this deficiency by combining nonlocal charge fluctuations in qs__gw _ _ with local spin fluctuations in dmft ( qs__gw__+``magnetic dmft '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) finally we show that the dynamics of the local fluctuations are actually not crucial . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of an external static field can lead to similarly good results if non - local correlations are included through qs__gw__.    high - resolution spectroscopy is limited in transition metals , in part because it is difficult to make sufficiently high quality samples . </S>",
    "<S> fe and ni are elements of which high quality films have been grown , and high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) performed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments provides a good reference to test the validity of different approximations of the electronic structure .    </S>",
    "<S> there are also not many calculations of spectral functions in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> fe has been studied in the local - density approximation ( lda )  @xcite and with corrections through dynamical - mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising that the lda does not track the arpes experiment well @xcite , but it has been found that lda+dmft also fails to properly account for arpes data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the _ gw _ approximation  @xcite is widely applied to many kinds of insulators , but how well it describes 3@xmath0 transition metals is much less established .    through quasiparticle self - consistency ( qs__gw _ _ ) </S>",
    "<S> one determines the noninteracting green s function @xmath1 which is minimally distant from the true green s function @xmath2 @xcite . within qs__gw </S>",
    "<S> _ _ many electronic properties are in excellent agreement with experiment  @xcite , most notably the quasiparticle band structures . moreover , at self - consistency the poles of qs__gw _ _ @xmath3 coincide with the peaks in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that there is no many - body `` mass renormalization '' of the noninteracting hamiltonian , which allows for a direct association of qs__gw _ _ energy bands @xmath5 with peaks in the spectral function @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , qs__gw </S>",
    "<S> _ _ provides an optimum framework to test the range of validity , and the limitations to the _ gw _ approximation .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we compare qs__gw _ _ results to various experimental data in elemental 3@xmath0 materials in the fermi liquid ( fl ) regime , with a heavy focus on fe because of the high quality of arpes @xcite and de haas - van alphen ( dhva )  @xcite data available . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that qs__gw _ _ and arpes spectral functions agree to within experimental resolution , with the proviso that the final state scattering is properly accounted in interpreting the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , discrepancies appear in ni  a classical itinerant ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> this can be attributed to the lack of spin fluctuations in _ gw _ diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> however we find out that there is no need to include finite - energy spin fluctuations , instead a static correction to the qsgw self - energy is sufficient to correct for the size of the local moment . </S>",
    "<S> while this finding is completely new within such an extensive formalism , it opens up an avenue to test the validity of a similar argument for other transition metals . </S>",
    "<S> the lda or lda+dmft should be problematic , as nonlocality in the self - energy can be important ( see supplemental material ) .           </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , along with some inverse photoemission data @xcite . while agreement appears to be very good , there are some discrepancies , particularly along the @xmath7-h line ( see also fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : gamh](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> as noted earlier , the qs__gw _ _ band structure reflects the peaks of @xmath6 with no renormalizations from the @xmath8- or @xmath9- dependence of @xmath10 .    in the fl regime , arpes spectra @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> are generally thought to be a fairly direct measure of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> but the two are not identical even in the fl regime , independently of the precision of the experimental setup . assuming a one - step model  @xcite for the photoemission process ( initial and final state coupled through fermi s golden rule @xcite ) @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 is the spectral function of the final state , broadened by scattering of the photoelectron as it approaches the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is the final - state surface transmission amplitude and @xmath14 the photoexcitation matrix element ( taken to be constant and @xmath15-independent  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the final state is considered to be a damped bloch wave , taking the form of a lorentzian distribution centred in @xmath16 and broadened by @xmath17  @xcite , while the initial state is an undamped bloch function with an energy broadening @xmath18 , obtained through the qs__gw _ _ spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation is reasonable since in the fl regime @xmath19 is sharply peaked around the qp level . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is directly related to the inverse of the electron mean free path . for photon energy in the range 100 - 130ev , @xmath21@xmath22 @xcite .      </S>",

    "<S> @xmath35=0.06ev tallies closely with the discrepancy between the v@xmath25 band and the measured arpes peak for 0.1h@xmath360.3h . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a significant discrepancy in the ii@xmath37 band near @xmath38h . where it crosses @xmath39 , the qs__gw _ _ bands deviate from the arpes peak by nearly 0.15ev . but </S>",

    "<S> thus we attribute most of the discrepancy in the fermi surface crossing ( red star in [ fig : qsgwbands](@xmath29 ) ) to an artifact of final - state scattering .    </S>",

    "<S> there is some ambiguity in resolving the small viii@xmath25 pocket at n because its tiny area is sensitive to computational details . </S>",
    "<S> discrepancies in the extremal areas are not very meaningful : it is more sensible to determine the change @xmath44 in fermi level needed to make the qs__gw _ _ area agree with dhva measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to the average error in the qs__gw _ _ qp levels , assuming that the bands shift rigidly . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is well verified for all pockets , except for the small vi one owing to strong electron - phonon coupling  @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < , < , < , > , < , < , > \" , ]     local spin fluctuations are well captured by localized non perturbative approaches such as dmft . </S>",
    "<S> we can reasonably expect that the addition of spin - flip diagrams to qs__gw _ _ would be sufficient to incorporate these effects . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath45+dmft study of ferromagnetic ni can be found in @xcite , but the dependency of @xmath45 on the starting point , together with all the advantages mentioned at the beginning , motivated us to devise a qs__gw__-based approach .    </S>",
    "<S> here we adopt a novel implementation merging qs__gw _ _ with dmft . </S>",
    "<S> we adapted haule s continuous time quantum monte carlo solver with the projection and embedding schemes described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and which are outlined in the supplemental material  @xcite .    the fully consistent qs__gw__+dmft calculation is composed by alternately repeated dmft and qs__gw _ _ loops . </S>",
    "<S> first the qs__gw _ _ green s function is converged at fixed density , then it is projected on the ni @xmath0-orbitals and finally , within the dmft loop , the local self - energy is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> updating the total density with the locally corrected green s function and repeating the procedure leads to complete self - consistency . </S>",
    "<S> this method fully takes into account the dynamics of the local spin - fluctuations included in the dmft diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> results are reported in table  [ tab : dmft_results ] and they confirm that dmft adds the correct local diagrams missing in the qs__gw _ _ theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover by carefully continuing the resulting green s function on the real - frequency axis , we find an exchange splitting of @xmath460.3 ev and a satellite at @xmath465 ev  @xcite .    in order to investigate the importance of the dynamics in the local spin - spin channels , we carry out a qs__gw__+dmft calculation by retaining only the static limit of the dmft loop ( we call it qs__gw__+``sldmft '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> once the dmft loop converges , we take the zero frequency limit of the magnetic part of the dmft self - energy and add it to the spin - averaged qs__gw _ _ hamiltonian  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as it is clearly shown in table [ tab : dmft_results ] and figure [ fig : mvse ] , this static hamiltonian reproduces very accurately magnetic moment and details of the band structure . </S>",
    "<S> this is a strong indication that for ni the dynamics of local spin fluctuations is not crucial </S>",
    "<S> . this will be the case if the quasiparticle picture is a reasonable description of ni , even if qs__gw _ _ alone does not contain enough physics to yield an optimum quasiparticle approximation .    to verify this further , we model spin fluctuations by carrying out the qs__gw _ _ self - consistent cycle in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath47 , and tuning @xmath48 to reduce @xmath49 ( see inset , figure [ fig : mvse ] ) </S>",
    "<S> our key finding is that when @xmath47 is tuned to make @xmath49 agree with experiment , @xmath50 does also , reproducing arpes spectra to high precision in the fl regime , as clearly reported in figure [ fig : mvse ] and table [ tab : dmft_results ] . both the qs__gw _ _ and lsda overestimate @xmath49 for itinerant systems , but the latter also _ underestimates _ it in local - moment systems ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mmom](@xmath29 ) ) . in the lsda treatment of ni , </S>",
    "<S> these effects cancel and render the moment fortuitously good . </S>",
    "<S> when spin fluctuations are folded in through @xmath47 , the lsda moment becomes too small . </S>",
    "<S> this finding must be interpreted as a sign of the superior level of internal consistency in the qs__gw _ _ theory with respect to lsda . </S>",
    "<S> without such a degree of consistency spin fluctuations could not be approximated by a static field .      </S>",
    "<S> we have performed detailed qs__gw _ _ calculations of the electronic band structure of several 3@xmath0 metallic compounds to assess the reliability of this theory in the fermi liquid regime and the importance of the non - local terms in the self - energy .    _  * fe : * _ through de haas - van alphen and cyclotron measurements we established that qs__gw _ _ qp levels at @xmath39 have an error of @xmath460.05  ev , and effective masses are well described . </S>",
    "<S> comparable precision is found below @xmath39 by comparing to arpes data , provided final state scattering is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the qs__gw _ _ @xmath0 bandwidth falls in close agreement with arpes , and is approximately @xmath51 times that of the lda ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qsgwbands ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 is @xmath52-averaged to simulate a local self - energy , the qs__gw _ _ band structure changes significantly and resembles the lda . </S>",
    "<S> thus non - locality in the self - energy is important in transition metals , and its absence explains why lda+dmft does not yield good agreement with arpes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _  * ni : * _ qs__gw _ _ @xmath0 bandwidths , the @xmath53 splitting , the @xmath54 alignment , are all in excellent agreement with experiment , while @xmath55 and @xmath50 are too large . </S>",
    "<S> however through the addition of a uniform static external field qs__gw _ _ can give both in good agreement , indicating a high level of consistency in the theory , contrary to lsda in which is not possible to have both quantities correct at the same time .    to account for spin fluctuations in an _ ab initio _ framework </S>",
    "<S> , we constructed a novel qs__gw__+dmft implementation and we utilised it at different degrees of approximations demonstrating that in itinerant magnets as ni ( i ) the dynamics of fluctuations is irrelevant ( ii ) their effect can be very well approximated by a static field as long as the non - local correlation part is treated accurately .    </S>",
