    "galaxy clusters form over a hubble time from rare , high - density peaks in the primordial density field on scales of a few mpc .",
    "their assembly via the hierarchical merging of smaller haloes from @xmath7 straddles the period of dark energy domination and , on the largest scales , is driven primarily by gravitational physics with little effect from e.g. , complex gas dynamics , feedback and stellar mass ( see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for a review ) . as a result ,",
    "cluster abundance  the number of clusters per comoving volume per solid angle above a certain mass  as a function of redshift depends solely on the expansion history of the universe and the growth of the initial fluctuations ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", measuring the evolution of the cluster mass function with redshift provides an independent probe for placing strong constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the ability to extract precision cosmology from cluster surveys relies on the selection function being well understood and the precise characterization of how a cluster observable translates to a cluster mass .    lying on the exponential tail of the mass function , the most massive clusters are of particular interest , especially those at high redshifts , @xmath8 , as they yield the largest differences between cosmologies .",
    "but , identifying such systems has been challenging , since they are inherently rare and since historically clusters have been detected via their optical flux or from the x - ray emission of the hot intracluster medium ( icm ; observational methods that suffer from cosmological dimming ) . in recent years",
    ", significant progress in this quest has been made through sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) surveys like act @xcite , spt @xcite and _ planck_@xcite .",
    "when cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons traveling towards us traverse the hot icm , many are inverse - compton scattered by the hot electrons in the plasma producing a shift in the blackbody spectrum of the cmb known as the sz effect ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the total , or integrated sz signal , @xmath9 , has been shown to correlate tightly with mass , it is only weakly dependent on redshift at @xmath10 and has a weak bias to gas concentration ( e.g , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the act and spt sz cluster surveys cover relatively small areas of sky ( @xmath11 sq degs;@xcite and @xmath12 sq degs;@xcite , respectively ) at arcminute resolution with the benefit of probing the low - to - medium mass end of the mass function .",
    "these surveys are complementary to the _ planck _ mission ( @xcite & @xcite ) , which is designed to detect the most massive clusters over the entire sky .",
    "the latest _ planck _",
    "results based on 15.5 months of data contain measurements towards 1227 systems ; 683 of these entries match a known cluster and , out of the 544 newly - discovered objects , 178 have been confirmed to be clusters through follow - up observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the major drawbacks of _ planck _ is its spatial resolution , which is between 5@xmath13 and @xmath14 at the relevant frequencies , and contributes to the @xmath15 errors on cluster parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , to fully exploit the characteristics of _ planck _ clusters to constrain cosmology , high resolution follow - up of the catalogued clusters is necessary .",
    "for this project we have used the 8-element subarray of the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy , -8 , to follow up 19 unconfirmed _",
    "planck_-discovered cluster candidates which we believed to be at @xmath16 from their wise colors .",
    "previous high resolution sz follow up of _ planck_-detected clusters and candidate clusters has been undertaken by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this work is divided into two articles .",
    "the first one , presented here , focuses on validating the sample candidate clusters .",
    "the second @xcite aims to constrain cluster parameters by fitting models to the data in a bayesian monte - carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) framework .",
    "the current article is organized as follows : details on the instruments and target selection are provided in section [ sec : sample ] .",
    "the carma data , including processing and main results , are presented in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "validation work using ancillary datasets is described in section [ sec : vali ] . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss whether any of the cluster candidates without a carma-8 sz detection are likely to be real . in section [ sec : redshiftandvalid ] , we ( 1 ) explore which of the selection criteria correlate best with detectability and ( 2 ) make use of wise and sdss to estimate or place constraints on the cluster redshift . the conclusions drawn from this study are provided in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout this work we present images where north is up and east is to the left .",
    "we use j2000 coordinates , as well as a @xmath17cdm cosmology with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
