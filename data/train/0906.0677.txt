    "advances in cosmological observations have presented us a concordance picture that our present universe is accelerating and the dominant mass - energy components for the evolution of the universe in the standard model are non - baryonic cold dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy field ( de)@xcite . the de is identified as the engine for the accelerated expansion . the leading interpretation of such de is a cosmological constant with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath1 . while the cosmological constant is consistent with the observational data , at the fundamental level it fails to be convincing : the vacuum energy density falls below the value predicted by any sensible quantum field theory by many orders of magnitude , and it unavoidably leads to the coincidence problem , i.e. ,  why are the vacuum and matter energy densities of precisely the same order today ? \" .",
    "more sophisticated models have been proposed to replace the cosmological constant by a dynamical dark energy in the conjectures relating the de either to a scalar field called quintessence with @xmath2 , or to an exotic field called phantom with @xmath3 .",
    "however , there is no clear winner in sight to explain the nature of de at the moment .",
    "most available discussions on the de were in the minimal picture which assumed that de does not feel any significant interactions from dm .",
    "although this picture is consistent with current observations , considering that de and dm account for significant fractions of the content of the universe , it is still natural , in the framework of field theory , to consider their interaction .",
    "the possibility that de and dm can interact with each other has been widely discussed recently@xcite-@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the coupling between de and dm can provide a mechanism to alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that the dynamical equilibrium of collapsed structures such as clusters would get modification due to the coupling between de and dm @xcite .",
    "the influences on the growth of cosmic structure due to the coupling between dark sectors were also shown in @xcite .",
    "observational signatures on the dark sectors mutual interaction have been found in the probes of the cosmic expansion history by using the snia , bao and cmb shift data etc @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that an appropriate interaction between de and dm can influence the perturbation dynamics and affect the lowest multipoles of the cmb power spectrum @xcite .",
    "recently there has been some concern about the stability of the perturbations if de and dm interact @xcite .",
    "however , it was proved in @xcite that the stability of the curvature perturbation depends on the types of coupling between dark sectors and the eos of de .",
    "based on the result in @xcite , we are in a position to carry out the global fitting to probe the interaction between dark sectors by using the cmb power spectrum data together with other observational data .    recently the wmap data showed the deficit of large scale power in the temperature map , in particular in the cmb quadrupole . the significant contribution to the fluctuations on these scales",
    "is the late integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect which is induced by the passage of cmb photons through the time evolving gravitational potential when the universe enters a rapid expansion phase once de dominates .",
    "the late isw effect has the unique ability to probe the  size \" of de .",
    "much effort has been put into determining the eos and the speed of sound of de @xcite .",
    "whether the late isw can give insight into the coupling between dark sectors is an interesting question . in this paper",
    "we are going to discuss this problem in detail .",
    "we will further employ the cmb data from ground based and satellite observations together with snia and sdss data to constrain the coupling between dark sectors .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in the following section we will review the general formalism of the perturbation theory in the presence of the interaction between de and dm . in sec.iii we will discuss the large scale cosmic microwave anisotropies and its imprint on the  size \" of de , especially the coupling between dark sectors . in sec.iv , we will present the global fitting result by using cmb data together with snia and sdss data and we will discuss the alleviation of the coincidence problem when de interacts with dm .",
    "we will present our conclusions and discussions in the end .",
    "in this section we will go over the perturbation theory when de interacts with dm .",
    "the detailed descriptions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the perturbed metric at first order is of the form @xmath4,\\label{perturbedspacetime}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 represent the scalar metric perturbations , @xmath6 is the cosmic scale factor and @xmath7    we work with general stress - energy tensor @xmath8 for a two - component system consisting of de and dm .",
    "each energy - mementum tensor satisfies the conservation law @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the interaction between different components and @xmath11 denotes either the dm or the de sector .    in the fourier space",
    "the perturbed energy - momentum tensor reads @xcite @xmath12    constructing the gauge invariant quantities@xcite @xmath13'\\label{invariantq}\\\\ \\delta q_{p\\lambda}^{i}&=&\\delta q_{p\\lambda } -q^0_{\\lambda } \\frac{e'}{2k}\\nonumber\\\\   d_{g\\lambda}&= & \\delta_{\\lambda}-\\frac{\\rho_{\\lambda}'}{\\rho_{\\lambda}\\mathcal{h}}\\left(\\phi+\\frac{e}{6}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ v_{\\lambda } & = & v_{\\lambda } -\\frac{e'}{2k},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtain the gauge invariant linear perturbation equations for dark sectors . for dm it reads , @xmath14 for de , we have @xmath15 where we have employed @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the effective sound speed of de at the rest frame , @xmath18 is the adiabatic sound speed .    to alleviate the singular behavior caused by @xmath19 crossing @xmath20",
    ", we substitute @xmath21 into @xmath22 in the above equations where @xmath23 thus we can rewrite eq (  [ dmv ] ) and eq (  [ dev ] ) into , @xmath24 @xmath25 the quantity @xmath26 is given by , @xmath27    to solve the above equations we have to specify the interaction form @xmath28 between de and dm .",
    "however , this is a hard task , since the nature of de and dm remains unknown , it is not possible at the present moment to derive the precise form of the interaction between them from first principles .",
    "one has to assume a specific coupling from the outset @xcite or determine it from phenomenological requirements @xcite .",
    "for the generality , we can assume the phenomenological description of the interaction between dark sectors in the comoving frame@xcite @xmath29^{t}\\nonumber\\\\ q_d^{\\nu}=\\left[-\\frac{3\\mathcal{h}}{a^2}(\\xi_1\\rho_c+\\xi_2\\rho_d),0,0,0\\right]^{t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are small positive dimensionless constants and @xmath31 is the transpose of the matrix .",
    "choosing positive sign in the interaction , one can ensure the direction of energy transfer from de to dm , which is required to alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite and avoid some unphysical problems such as negative de density etc @xcite .",
    "the perturbed gauge - invariant coupling vector can be calculated by @xmath32'\\ ] ] @xmath33'\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "for the reason as illustrated in @xcite , we set @xmath35 . using continuous equations to eliminate @xmath36 in eq (  [ dmu ] ) , eq (  [ deu ] ) , we obtain the perturbation equations@xcite , @xmath37   \\nonumber\\\\ & & -9\\mathcal{h}w\\left(\\xi_1r+\\xi_2 + 1+w\\right ) \\phi+3\\mathcal{h}w d_d+3w'\\phi+3(\\xi_1r+\\xi_2)\\phi'-ku_d-6\\psi\\mathcal{h}(\\xi_1 r+\\xi_2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 3\\mathcal{h}\\xi_1r(d_{gd}-d_{gc } ) \\label{density } \\\\ u_d ' & = & -\\mathcal{h}(1 - 3w)u_d+kc_e^2\\left\\{d_{gd}-3\\left(\\xi_1 r+\\xi_2 + 1+w\\right ) \\phi\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & & -(c_e^2-c_a^2)a^2q^0_d\\frac{u_d}{(1+w)\\rho_d}+ 3(c_e^2-c_a^2)\\mathcal{h}u_d+(1+w)k\\psi+3\\mathcal{h } ( \\xi_1r+\\xi_2)u_d . \\label{velocity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in solving these equations we will adopt the adiabatic initial condition@xcite @xmath38    dynamical stability of the de and dm perturbations were examined in detail in @xcite . in the general form of the phenomenological interaction , when de eos @xmath39 and we choose the coupling between dark sectors proportional to the dm energy density ( by setting @xmath40 while keeping @xmath41 nonzero ) or the total dark sectors energy density ( by setting @xmath42 ) , we observed the dynamical instability in perturbations as argued in @xcite .",
    "however , when we choose the dark sectors mutual interaction proportional to the energy density of de by taking @xmath43 and @xmath44 , even for @xmath39 we have the stable perturbations . when eos of de @xmath45 , no matter the interaction proportional to the energy density of the individual dark sector or the total dark sectors , the perturbation is always stable .",
    "with the formalism of the perturbation theory , we are in a position to study the cmb power spectrum . in our analysis",
    "we will concentrate on models with constant @xmath19 and a constant speed of sound .",
    "the temperature anisotropy power spectrum can be calculated by @xmath46 where @xmath47 gives the transfer function for each @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the primodial power spectrum and @xmath50 is the conformal time today . on large scales the transfer functions are of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is",
    "the contribution from the last scattering surface given by the ordinary sachs - wolfe ( sw ) effect and @xmath53 is the contribution due to the change of the gravitational potential when photons passing through the universe on their way to earth and is called the isw effect .",
    "the isw contribution can be written as @xmath54)e^{\\kappa(\\tau_0)-\\kappa(\\tau)}[\\psi'-\\phi'],\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the spherical bessel function , @xmath56 denotes the optical depth for thompson scattering . from einstein equations , we obtain , @xmath57- \\mathcal{t}'\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the anisotropic stress of relativistic components which can be neglected in the following discussion .",
    "the isw effect can be classified into early and late times effects .",
    "the early isw effect takes place from the time following recombination to the time when radiation is no longer dynamically significant , which gives clues about what is happening in the universe from the radiation domination to matter domination .",
    "the late time isw effect arises when de becomes dynamically important and has the unique ability to probe the  size \" of de .",
    "when de becomes non - negligible , the gravitational potential decays .",
    "when a photon passes throw a decaying potential well , it will have a net gain in energy and thus leads to the late isw effect .",
    "the late isw effect is a significant contribution to the large scale power in the temperature map of cmb .    in the minimal case",
    "when there is no interaction between de and dm , the presence of de perturbations leaves a @xmath19 and @xmath17 dependent signature in the late isw source term . for @xmath39 , it was observed that the cmb temperature anisotropies on large scales got enhanced for bigger constant values of @xmath17@xcite .",
    "it was argued that increasing @xmath17 increases the suppression of dm perturbations and therefore increases the contribution to the isw effect@xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath45 the effect is reversed , with the perturbation initially of opposite sign , and the contribution to the isw effect increases as the sound speed of de is decreased@xcite .",
    "the interplay between perturbations in the de and dm and the isw effect is very subtle and it is more direct to cross - correlate the late isw effect to its source term , the change of the gravitational potential@xcite .    the late isw effect is a promising tool to measure the eos and sound speed of de . whether it can present us the signature of the interaction between de and dm is a question we are going to address here .",
    "we will concentrate our discussions on three commonly studied phenomenologically interaction forms between dark sectors , namely the interaction proportional to the energy density of de , dm and total dark sectors , respectively .",
    "when we choose the coupling between dark sectors proportional to the energy density of de , the perturbation was found stable with an eos @xmath39 as well as @xmath45@xcite . for chosen constant eos satisfying @xmath39 and @xmath60 , the result of large scale cmb anisotropies for different couplings",
    "are shown in fig  [ figone]a .",
    "the lower set of dashed lines describes the late isw effect , the middle dotted lines show the combination of the sw effect together with the early isw effect and the top solid lines are for the total large scale cmb angular power spectra .",
    "it is clear to see that such kind of interaction between dark sectors leaves obvious signature in the late isw effect which influences the large scale total cmb spectrum , but does not change much of the sw and early isw effects . comparing to the non - coupling case",
    "( @xmath61 ) , the positive coupling with energy decay from de to dm enhances the late isw effect , while the more negative coupling with more energy decay from dm to de suppresses more the late isw contribution .",
    "this can be understood from the evolution of the isw source term , the change of the gravitational potential displayed in fig  [ figone]b . the bigger value of the coupling results in the further change of the gravitational potential . in fig",
    "[ figone]c we have shown the influence of the sound speed .",
    "it can be seen that the bigger sound speed of the de makes the difference caused by different couplings bigger in the large scale cmb power spectra .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the likelihood of the coupling constant is shown in fig  [ dm]b .",
    "the evolution of the ratio of energy densities between de and dm for this kind of interaction is shown in fig  [ eight ] .     when the coupling is proportional to the energy density of total dark sectors.,width=268,height=268 ]",
    "we have reviewed the formalism of the perturbation theory when there is interaction between de and dm .",
    "based upon this formalism we have studied the signature of the interaction between dark sectors in the cmb large scale temperature fluctuations .",
    "we found that in addition to disclose the de eos , sound speed , the late isw effect is a promising tool to measure the coupling between dark sectors .",
    "when the interaction between de and dm takes the form proportional to the energy density of dm and the total dark sectors , because in these cases de and dm started to chase each other since early time , the interaction not only presents in the late isw source term but also leaves imprint in the sw and early isw effects .",
    "these properties provide a possible way to examine the interaction between de and dm even from smaller scale in cmb observations .",
    "we have performed the global fitting by using the cmb power spectrum data including wmap5 data and balloon observational data together with snia and sdss data to constrain the interaction between de and dm .",
    "when the interaction between de and dm takes the form proportional to the energy density of dm and the total dark sectors , since it leaves more information in the cmb power spectra , not only just in the very large scale , the coupling can be constrained in a very precise range . in @xmath0",
    "the coupling is positive indicating that there is energy transfer from de to dm .",
    "this kind of energy transfer can help to alleviate the coincidence problem compared to the noninteracting case .",
    "it is of great interest to extend our study to a field theory description of the interaction between de and dm and examine its signature in the large scale cmb power spectra .",
