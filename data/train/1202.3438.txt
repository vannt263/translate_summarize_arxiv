    "early - type galaxies do not fill the full three dimensional space defined by size , central velocity dispersion and surface brightness ( usually evaluated at the half light radius ) .",
    "rather , they define a relatively thin manifold which has come to be called the fundamental plane ( e.g. djorgovski & davis 1987 ; jrgensen et al . 1996 ; pahre et al . 1998 ; bernardi et al . 2003 ; jrgensen et al . 2006 ; bolton et al . 2008 ; hyde & bernardi 2009b ) .    the fundamental plane is usually written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the half light radius , @xmath10 is the velocity dispersion ( typically corrected to an aperture of @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 is the surface brightness within @xmath12 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 is loosely refered to as the ` slope ' , and @xmath15 is the ` zero - point ' ; it is simply @xmath16 .",
    "the shape of the fundamental plane is determined by estimating @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are thought to encode useful information about these objects .",
    "this is because the values @xmath17 and @xmath18 are expected on dimensional grounds if the virial theorem holds exactly in the observed variables , and mass is linearly proportional to light .",
    "if @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 then the fp is said to be ` tilted ' .",
    "the tilt may be due to a combination of stellar population effects , initial mass function variations , and variations in the dark matter fraction within @xmath12 ( e.g. pahre et al . 1998 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ; bolton et al . 2008 ; hyde & bernardi 2009b ; graves & faber 2010 ) .",
    "however , the inferred tilt also depends on how the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 were measured .",
    "this is typically done either by minimizing residuals in the @xmath12 direction , or in the direction orthogonal to the fit . in general",
    "the ` direct ' and ` orthogonal ' fit parameters are different combinations of the mean values of and covariances between the variables @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , in practice , naive estimation of these means and covariances ( e.g. simply summing over the data without including other weight terms ) may lead to biases induced by measurement errors ( these usually affect the covariances ) or by selection effects ( which bias the means and the covariances ) .",
    "the effects of both must be accounted - for to estimate the intrinsic shape parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( e.g. saglia et al .",
    "this is especially important when the fp is determined for galaxies in a magnitude limited sample ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to provide analytic expressions which describe the plane for both the direct , inverse and orthogonal fitting procedures which show clearly how to account for measurement errors and selection effects .",
    "in addition , by providing analytic expressions for all quantities of interest , our results remove the need for numerical nonlinear minimization methods for obtaining the best - fit coefficients .",
    "our analysis is complementary to that in saglia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who provide an excellent description of the key differences between the different fitting procedures . when we illustrate the results of our analysis , the numerical values we use come from the sdss - based early - type sample compiled by hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) .",
    "the discussion above has focussed on the direction of the smallest scatter . if we think of the plane as being defined by three orthogonal vectors , one orthogonal to the plane and the others in it , then the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 describe the vector which is orthogonal to the plane .",
    "if @xmath24 denotes this vector , and the other two vectors ( in the plane ) are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then saglia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that these three eigenvectors are well - approximated by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denote unit vectors in the size , velocity dispersion and surface brightness directions .",
    "although saglia et al . justified these scalings using numerical experiments , we show , in section  [ analysis ] , that this form follows from the fact that the distribution of surface brightnesses is much broader than that of velocity dispersions .",
    "section  [ analysis ] also shows that many of the properties of the @xmath31 fundamental plane can be understood as arising from the fact that surface brightness and velocity dispersion are almost uncorrelated at @xmath31 . in section  [ evolve ]",
    "we argue that , in models of pure luminosity evolution , this is only a coincidence : the two were correlated in the past .",
    "a final section summarizes our conclusions and discusses why measurements of this correlation in high-@xmath9 datasets will provided interesting constraints on models .    in an appendix",
    ", we provide a description of how the fp coefficients differ between magnitude limited and volume limited samples , when the underlying pairwise scaling relations are linear . although there is now growing evidence for curvature in these relations ( e.g. bernardi et al . 2007a ; lauer et al . 2007 ; hyde & bernardi 2009a ; bernardi et al .",
    "2011 ) , we feel our expressions are useful since the curvature is usually due to a small fraction of the objects in the tails of the distribution .",
    "moreover , our expressions are generally applicable to any study of three observables  not just those associated with the fundamental plane .",
    "it may be that the assumption of no curvature is more accurate for some of these other scaling relations .",
    "some examples include the joint distribution of the luminosity and velocity dispersion of a galaxy and its color or the mass of its black - hole ( bernardi et al .",
    "2005 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2007b ) , or the relation between the x - ray luminosity , sz - signal strength and optical richness of a cluster .",
    "the analysis which follows is actually the restriction to a special case of the following general statement .",
    "since the general case is also of interest in these glorious days of large panchromatic datasets , we state it first .",
    "suppose we have @xmath32 observables which are distributed following a multivariate gaussian distribution having means @xmath33 and covariance matrix @xmath34 .",
    "suppose that we split them up into two sets , a with @xmath35 observables and b with the other @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the mean vector and covariance matrix of set a , and similarly define @xmath39 and @xmath40 for set b. then the distribution of @xmath41 given that @xmath42 is known , is multivariate gaussian with mean @xmath43 and covariance matrix @xmath44 in what follows , we will study the special case in which @xmath45 and @xmath46 . since this makes @xmath40 a @xmath47 matrix ,",
    "its inverse is simple , so the expression above is analytically tractable .      for our three variables",
    ", we will use @xmath3 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 to denote @xmath50/kpc ) , @xmath51/km  s@xmath52 ) and @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 denote the real symmetric matrix which describes the covariances between these three variables : @xmath55 the shape of the fundamental plane is completely determined by this covariance matrix .",
    "hence , our problem is to estimate the coefficients of this matrix in a way which accounts for selection effects and measurement errors ( see section  [ covar ] ) .    in what follows",
    ", we will provide expressions for various quantities which can be derived from @xmath54 .",
    "although our expressions are general , we will sometimes remark on what they imply .",
    "in such cases , we will use the values reported by hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) : @xmath56 where @xmath49 was measured in dex ( rather than magnitudes ) .",
    "in particular , table  [ tab : fpfits ] summarizes the various values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which can be derived from this @xmath54 , depending on how one fits the fundamental plane .",
    "note that these coefficients are often determined via numerical nonlinear minimization schemes .",
    "in the following subsections , we provide analytic expressions for these parameters , thus eliminating the need for such schemes .",
    ".coefficients of various fits to the fundamental plane @xmath57 in the @xmath58-band sample of about 40000 objects defined by hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) , after correcting for the magnitude limit selection effect .",

    "then @xmath62 this shows that @xmath63 is indeed much smaller than @xmath64 or @xmath65 : surface brightness and velocity dispersion are almost uncorrelated .",
    "this turns out to be a simple way to understand many features of the fundamental plane .      in an apparent magnitude limited survey of @xmath66 objects ,",
    "the mean value of an observed quantity @xmath67 , @xmath68 , may be biased from its true mean value ( e.g. , if the observable correlates with luminosity ) .",
    "fortunately , this bias is easily removed by defining , for each object with luminosity @xmath69 , the total volume over which the object could have been observed : @xmath70 ( e.g. schmidt 1968 ) .",
    "one then uses this to define a ( normalized ) weight @xmath71 and estimates the mean value of @xmath67 as @xmath72 where the sum is over all the objects in the sample .    for similar reasons",
    ", the covariance between observables will also be biased by the selection effect , but this bias can be removed by applying the same weight .",
    "the covariance may also be biased by measurement errors .",
    "if we define the matrix @xmath73 to have elements @xmath74,\\ ] ] and the measurement error matrix @xmath75 by @xmath76 ( we have assumed zero mean for the errors , and often , @xmath77 is assumed to be the same for all objects ) , then @xmath78 is an unbiased estimate of the intrinsic covariance matrix .",
    "notice that each element of @xmath79 has had the contribution from measurement errors to the observed covariance subtracted off : @xmath80 .",
    "if this term is not subtracted , i.e. , if one uses @xmath81 instead of @xmath54 in what follows , one will obtain a plane that has been distorted by measurement error . in the appendix",
    ", we quantify the bias which results from ignoring the @xmath82 weight ; i.e. , of setting @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .    some workers like to account for the fact that certain measurements are more secure than others by weighting each measurement by the inverse of the estimated uncertainty on it . in this case , if one defines @xmath85 where @xmath86 then one must also define @xmath87 before estimating @xmath88 as before . in practice , it makes sense to replace @xmath89 for some @xmath90 that is chosen to prevent a few well - measured objects from dominating the sums .",
    "if we write the fundamental plane as @xmath91 then @xmath92 ( bernardi et al .",
    "note that because of how we defined our @xmath93 , these expressions have been corrected for the effects of errors , and because of the weighting term @xmath94 , they have been corrected for selection effects .",
    "equation  ( [ adirect ] ) shows that @xmath95 is simply the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath48 minus the contribution which comes from @xmath96 and @xmath97 correlations .",
    "similarly , @xmath98 is the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath49 minus the contribution which comes from the @xmath99 and @xmath97 correlations . it might help to think of these as follows .",
    "let @xmath100 denote the residual in @xmath3 from the @xmath96 correlation",
    ". then @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , @xmath102 is the ratio of @xmath103 to the range of @xmath48 values at fixed @xmath49 , @xmath104 , so it is the slope of the correlation between @xmath105 and @xmath48 , at fixed @xmath49 .",
    "of course , @xmath98 can be understood similarly .",
    "the fact that , in the data , neither @xmath102 nor @xmath98 are zero implies that both the @xmath99 and @xmath106 correlations are fundamental  they are not consequences of other relations .",
    "moreover , note that if @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) , then @xmath102 and @xmath98 are really just the slopes of the @xmath109 and @xmath110 relations .",
    "in addition , if @xmath111 , then the direct fit has the convenient property that the errors on the fitted coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath98 are independent .",
    "we show below that @xmath111 turns out to be an easy way to understand some properties of the fundamental plane .",
    "this form of the plane ( i.e. , the direct fit ) should be used if the distance independent quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are used to predict the distant dependent one @xmath3 . the accuracy with which @xmath3 is predicted by @xmath49 and @xmath48",
    "is limited by the rms scatter around this fit , which is ( the square root of ) @xmath112    confidence limits on @xmath102 and @xmath98 themselves can be obtained as follows .",
    "if there were no measurement errors , then the 68% confidence limits on the best fit values @xmath102 and @xmath98 would be given by the square root of @xmath113 $ ] and @xmath114 $ ] , where we have defined @xmath115 and @xmath116 is given by equation  ( [ chi2min ] ) .",
    "note that the confidence limit on @xmath102 is proportional to the scatter around the best fit , @xmath116 , divided by the number of degrees of freedom ( which is essentially the sample size ) , as one might expect .",
    "however , it is also scales inversely with @xmath117 because , as the intrinsic spread in @xmath48 at fixed @xmath49 decreases , it becomes increasingly difficult to measure the slope of the @xmath99 relation ( at fixed @xmath49 ) .",
    "similar arguments apply to @xmath98 .",
    "this means that the uncertainty on @xmath102 will be @xmath118 times the uncertainty on @xmath98 , independent of sample size .",
    "the errors on these best - fitting coefficients are correlated .",
    "the correlation is the square root of @xmath119 $ ] ; it is nonzero if @xmath120 .    measurement errors ( random , not systematic ) decrease the precision of these estimates as follows .",
    "if @xmath121 ( note that this is just the observational analogue of equation  [ chi2min ] ) , then the limits on @xmath102 and @xmath98 are well - approximated by @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively , where @xmath124 where @xmath125 , for @xmath126 or @xmath127 respectively .",
    "the superscript @xmath128 is to remind us that @xmath129 carries an extra weighting factor compared to @xmath130",
    ". it may be helpful to think of @xmath131 as defining an effective sample size @xmath132 .",
    "this is because , if all the weights are the same then ( because our weights are normalized ) @xmath83 , so @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath134 is really @xmath135 , making the correspondence with the case in which there were no measurement errors obvious : one replaces @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( to account for measurement errors ) and @xmath138 ( to account for the weights ) .",
    "if each measurement was weighted by its uncertainty , then all @xmath139 , and all @xmath140 are given by equation  ( [ ewtdoxy ] ) with @xmath141 in the sum in the numerator , but only @xmath94 in the denominator .",
    "some authors prefer to keep the spectroscopic quantity @xmath48 as the dependent variable , and so fit @xmath142 this has some merit , because the measurement of @xmath48 is often much noiser than that of the combination of @xmath3 and @xmath49 which defines the plane ( e.g. correlated errors in @xmath3 and @xmath49 when fitting to the surface brightness profile mean that @xmath143 is typically determined to within 0.005 ) .",
    "if the errors are essentially all on @xmath48 , then they do not bias the coefficients of the ` direct ' fit to this relation , so one can safely ignore them when estimating the coefficients of the fit .",
    "so , the question arises as to how well @xmath144 approximate @xmath145 . by simply interchanging @xmath3 and @xmath48 in the expressions above",
    ", one finds @xmath146 with rms scatter equal to the square root of @xmath147 the intrinsic uncertainty on @xmath148 is @xmath149^{-1/2}$ ] , and that for @xmath150 is @xmath151 times that on @xmath152 .",

    "as before , a good estimate of the uncertainties in the presence of measurement errors and weights comes from replacing @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath153 and @xmath161 for @xmath154 .    notice that , in general , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "e.g. , if @xmath164 then @xmath165 the determinant of @xmath54 ( the matrix defined in equation  [ calf ] ) must be positive definite , so if @xmath107 , then @xmath166 , which means @xmath167 . thus , although @xmath168 in this limit , @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , the temptation to rearrange equation  ( [ abinverse ] ) so as to use @xmath170 to estimate @xmath3 should be avoided , as it is guaranteed to lead to a bias .",
    "in addition to a bias , the associated noise in this estimator of @xmath3 , @xmath171 is larger than @xmath172 .      for completeness",
    "( though see graves & faber 2010 for why this might be an interesting choice ) , we now give the result of fitting the plane when @xmath49 is the dependent variable : @xmath173 in this case , @xmath174 the intrinsic error on @xmath175 is @xmath176^{-1/2}$ ] and on @xmath177 is @xmath178^{-1/2}$ ] , with the usual replacements to account for measurement errors .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that , like the inverse fit , @xmath179 is also a biased predictor of @xmath180 .",
    "e.g. , if @xmath108 , then @xmath181 but @xmath182 so @xmath183 .",
    "the expression for the orthogonal fit coefficients is more complicated , since it requires knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath54 .",
    "however , the eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial , and , since @xmath54 is a @xmath184 matrix , this polynomial is a cubic , so the roots satisfy @xmath185              + { \\rm",

    "if we write the eigenvector associated with eigenvalue @xmath190 as @xmath191 where @xmath192 and @xmath30 are unit vectors in the size , velocity dispersion , and surface - brightness directions , then @xmath193 we are particularly interested in the smallest eigenvalue , since the square root of it gives the intrinsic rms scatter orthogonal to the fundamental plane .",
    "suppose this eigenvalue is @xmath194 .",
    "then the coefficients of the associated eigenvector are given by inserting @xmath194 in the expression above .",
    "it is conventional to use @xmath195 to denote @xmath196 , so that @xmath197 with intrinsic uncertainty well - approximated by @xmath198 and @xmath199 with @xmath200 .",
    "measurement errors make these @xmath201 and @xmath202 where @xmath203 .",
    "notice that , in the thin plane limit , @xmath204 , so @xmath205 comparison with equations  ( [ adirect][bdirect ] ) shows that , in this limit , the coefficients of the direct and orthogonal fits are the same ( as they should be ) .",
    "when @xmath206 then @xmath207 since @xmath194 is the smallest eigenvalue , it is smaller than either @xmath208 or @xmath209 , so the coefficients of the orthogonal fit are _ guaranteed _ to be larger than those of the direct fit ; in this limit , this means that they are slightly larger than the slopes of the simpler pairwise @xmath109 and @xmath110 relations . in practice , @xmath210 so this will make @xmath211 but @xmath212 .",
    "these expressions ( e.g. equation  [ civ=0 ] ) make it easy to understand the effect of restricting the range of @xmath10 in the sample , as is done in hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) .",
    "this will have the effect of decreasing @xmath209 , making @xmath213 , thus increasing @xmath214 , but leaving @xmath215 essentially unchanged ( see figure  8 in hyde & bernardi 2009b ) .",
    "although we concentrated on the smallest eigenvalue and its eigenvector , the expressions above are also valid for each eigenvalue .",
    "thus , if the largest eigenvalue , @xmath216 , is much larger than @xmath209 , then the associated eigenvector @xmath25 will have essentially no component in the @xmath48 direction : @xmath217 .",
    "when this is the case , as it is for most datasets ( @xmath216 must be greater than @xmath208 and @xmath218 for most if not all fp datasets ) , then the fact that the three eigenvectors are orthogonal allows us to express the coefficients of the other two eigenvectors ( those in the fp rather than orthogonal to it ) as simple combinations of @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "namely , @xmath219 sets @xmath220 , and then @xmath221 sets @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",

    "the previous section showed the simplifications which are possible if one of the pairwise correlations vanishes .",
    "the other case of interest is when one of the correlations is entirely due to the other two .",

    "this is one example of where direct analysis of the elements of the covariance matrix is more interesting , and provides more insight , than analysis of its principle components .",

    "naively , this is surprising , since @xmath288 at @xmath31 , so one might have thought it would not be changed at all if neither @xmath3 nor @xmath48 change .",
    "moreover , one might have expected @xmath1 to change , perhaps strongly , because the luminosity evolution would change both @xmath289 and @xmath208 . to see why @xmath1 changes only weakly , note that @xmath254 means that the distribution of @xmath236 was narrower at high @xmath9 . in the limit",
    "in which all objects have the same luminosity @xmath290 ; thus , differential evolution can not force @xmath291 below @xmath292 .",
    "since @xmath293 at @xmath31 , and it can not become smaller than 1/2 , the evolution in @xmath1 is weak . thus , our analysis shows that @xmath0 is more strongly affected than @xmath1 because luminosity evolution makes @xmath120 at higher @xmath9 , and because differential evolution makes the distribution of @xmath236 narrower in the past .      while consistent with the measurements , pure ( differential ) luminosity evolution is not required by them .",
    "for example , the expected form of this evolution implies a narrower distribution of @xmath236 at high redshift . since a magnitude limited selection effect",
    "would also produce a narrower distribution of @xmath236 , one must first be sure that this is not producing the observed changes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , figure  7 in hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) shows that removing faint galaxies from the @xmath31 sample decreases @xmath0 and @xmath291 . since this is qualitatively the same as the change in the fp coefficients between @xmath31 and @xmath294 , statements about differential evolution",
    "should only be believed if accompanied by measurements of a change in the slope of the size-@xmath236 and @xmath295 relations ",
    "the fp itself is a very bad diagnostic .",
    "moreover , the analysis above assumes that only the luminosities evolve . however , there is much recent discussion of the fact that , at fixed stellar mass , galaxies appear to be more than three times smaller at @xmath296 than at @xmath297 ( e.g. trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ; cimatti et al . 2008 ; van dokkum et al . 2008 ) although the evidence is not uncontested ( e.g. mancini et al . 2010 ; sarocco et al . 2010 ) .",
    "indeed , saglia et al .",
    "( 2010 ) interpret their measurements of the evolution of the fundamental plane entirely in terms of structural evolution , rather than differential evolution of luminosity !    at fixed @xmath257 , they find that the sizes are slightly smaller and velocity dispersions slightly larger at @xmath298 than at @xmath297 . while the redshift dependance they report is in quantitative agreement with that derived by bernardi ( 2009 ) from a substantially larger dataset restricted to a narrower redshift range ( @xmath299 ) , we must again worry about selection effects on these estimates of structural evolution .",
    "for example , suppose that the evolution was purely in the luminosities , and it was not differential , but the high-@xmath9 measurements only see the largest @xmath236 .",
    "then because both @xmath3 and @xmath257 correlate with @xmath236 , the @xmath300 relation will be biased by this selection on @xmath236 ( even though @xmath236 does not enter explicitly in the @xmath301 relation ) .",
    "in addition , relating the high-@xmath9 measurements to those at @xmath31 requires a better understanding of the systematic differences in band - passes , of how the velocity dispersion measurement at high-@xmath9 relates to the one at @xmath31 ( e.g. , effective aperture effects ) , and of whether or not the high-@xmath9 population really is made up of the progenitors of the @xmath31 population . exploring this further (",
    "e.g. how should one account for the fact that the youngest members of the @xmath31 population simply did not exist at @xmath8 ?",
    "what role do mergers play ? ) , in the context of differential evolution models , is the subject of work in progress .",
    "we started from a general expression for the conditional distribution of @xmath35 correlated variables when @xmath36 other variables are known ( equations  [ condmean ] and  [ condcovariance ] ) , and specialized to the case @xmath45 .",
    "this provided analytic expressions which describe the fundamental plane associated with three correlated variables .",
    "our expressions allow one to see why the coefficients of the direct , inverse and orthogonal fits differ ( equations  [ adirect][bdirect ] , [ ainverse][binverse ] , [ aorth][borth ] , and table  [ tab : fpfits ] ) ; how to estimate the uncertainties on these coefficients ; why the three eigenvectors which describe the fp have the form they do ( equation  [ fpvectors ] and section  [ evectors ] ) ; and to see how and why the fundamental plane in a magnitude limited survey will , in general , differ from that in a complete sample ( appendix ) .",
    "if one views all pairwise correlations as having a component that is due to the individual correlations between each observable and luminosity , and another component which is not , then our analysis shows that only the part which is not due to the correlations with luminosity remains unaffected by the magnitude limited selection : the other part is biased ( e.g. , equation  [ invariant ] ) .",
    "our analysis also shows how to remove this bias , as well as account for measurement errors . by providing analytic expressions for all quantities of interest , our results",
    "remove the need for numerical nonlinear minimization methods for obtaining the best - fit coefficients .",
    "these results were used by hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) in their analysis of the sdss fundamental plane .",
    "many properties of the fundamental plane at @xmath31 can be understood as arising from the fact that surface brightness and velocity dispersion are uncorrelated .",
    "this raises the question of whether or not this lack of correlation encodes something fundamental about the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "recent work suggests that the coefficients of the fundamental plane at @xmath302 are significantly different from those at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we showed that , in models where massive galaxies evolve less rapidly than low mass galaxies , but there are no changes to the size or velocity dispersions , there is a one - to - one relation between the changes to @xmath274 and the correlation between luminosity and mass ( figure  [ evolvefp ] ) .",
    "( we also showed that , even though @xmath274 change , the relationship between the eigenvectors of the plane ( equation  [ fpvectors ] ) does not . ) this relation , which is in reasonable agreement with the measurements , also predicts that @xmath120 at higher @xmath9 .",
    "i.e. , in this model , @xmath107 at @xmath31 is just a coincidence .    while consistent with the fp measurements , pure ( differential ) luminosity evolution is not required by them .",
    "e.g. , a selection effect on luminosity will produce qualitatively similar changes to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , making the fp a very bad diagnostic of this sort of evolution ; the size-@xmath236 and @xmath295 relations are much better . moreover , other scaling relations suggest there has been substantial structural evolution since @xmath8 .",
    "again , selection effects complicate the relationship between the observed changes to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the structural evolution parameters .",
    "accounting for these is the subject of work in progress , but we note that if @xmath303 remains small even at high @xmath9 , then this will provide a simple way to constrain models of the structural changes that complement differential luminosity evolution .",

    "although the main text worked with luminosity in solar units , rather than absolute magnitudes , the analysis in this appendix uses magnitudes .",

    "in essence , all that is really required is an estimate of how the mean and the width of the observed luminosity distribution is affected by the magnitude - limited selection .",

    ". this difference will differ from one sample to another : we will quantify it for the sdss sample shortly .      these expressions can be rearranged to express the correct intrinsic correlations in terms of the selection - biased ones : @xmath321 the intrinsic correlations with @xmath49 can then be got from @xmath322 with mean values @xmath323 note that the quantity which is the same in the full and magnitude limited samples is @xmath324 this makes intuitive sense , because the expression above is the part of the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath48 which is not due to the individual correlations between @xmath3 and @xmath317 , and @xmath48 and @xmath317 .",
    "this part , i.e. , the part which does not correlate with @xmath317 , remains unchanged by the magnitude limited selection .",
    "similar relations hold for @xmath325 , @xmath209 , etc .",
    "the analysis above shows that , to account for the selection bias , all one needs is an estimate of the difference between the unweighted and weighted mean and variance of the absolute magnitude distribution ( i.e. of the bias in the luminosity function ) . in the sdss dataset of hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) , @xmath326 so , e.g. , @xmath327 and @xmath328 .",
    "this illustrates a trivial but important point : the width of the luminosity ( and other ) distributions in a magnitude limited catalog ",
    "i.e. , before correcting for the selection effect  may be _ narrower _ than in the intrinsic distribution .",
    "the expressions above also show that the magnitude limited catalog can exhibit correlations between variables even when there is no true intrinsic correlation .",
    "e.g , @xmath329 thus , @xmath330 even if @xmath107 . for similar reasons ,",
    "absence of a correlation in the magnitude limited catalog does not imply vanishing correlation in the full sample .",
    "we have verified that the expressions above agree with measurements of the bias in mock catalogs in which there is no curvature in the underlying scaling relations . in practice , however , there is weak curvature in most scaling relations ( e.g. , hyde & bernardi 2009a ; bernardi et al . 2011 ) , and this renders the expressions above only approximate .",
    "for example , hyde & bernardi ( 2009b ) report that @xmath331 , @xmath332 and @xmath333 , @xmath334 , @xmath335 , @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "these are not quite the same as one expects from the expressions above , although the differences can be understood in terms of how the underlying scaling relations curve .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis does serve to illustrate which relations are expected to be insensitive to selection effects arising from a magnitude limit , and which are not .",
    "for example , it is sometimes stated that the parameters of the inverse fit ( equation  [ abinv ] ) and the fit in which @xmath49 is the dependent variable ( equation  [ abi ] ) are not affected by the selection effect .",
    "the analysis above shows that this is , in general , not correct .",
    "however , if we ignore the selection effect then @xmath340 ; table  [ tab : fpfits ] shows that the correct values are @xmath341 , suggesting that @xmath153 at least is not very biased , at least in the sdss dataset .",
    "in addition , @xmath342 whereas the parameters from table  [ tab : fpfits ] show that @xmath343 . for comparison , graves & faber ( 2010 ) report @xmath344 , for a slightly different early - type galaxy sample .    in all cases ,",
    "@xmath0 is not strongly affected by the magnitude limit . to see why , note that @xmath345 where we have defined @xmath346 , and the final expression holds in the limit @xmath164 , in which case @xmath347 .",
    "now , @xmath348 is the slope of the size - absolute magnitude relation : in the sdss , this is about @xmath349 . similarly , @xmath350 and @xmath351 ,",
    "so the net effect is to have @xmath352 within about ten percent of @xmath353 , making @xmath354 also to within about ten percent .",
    "since @xmath355 when @xmath107 , we expect @xmath356 , to within ten percent .",
    "a similar analysis of @xmath153 shows why it too is not strongly affected by the magnitude limit .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that , although we have focussed on the slopes of the correlations , the fact that the mean values in the magnitude - limited sample differ from the correct values ( @xmath357 etc . )",
    "means that the zero - points of the relations can be affected even if the slopes are not . since the zero - point of the fundamental plane",
    "is often used as a basis for estimating evolution , this estimate must be made carefully in magnitude limited samples .",
    "bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that this effect does indeed produce a significant offset in the sdss .",
