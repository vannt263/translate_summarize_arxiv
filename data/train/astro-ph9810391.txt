    "the possibility that a cosmological abundance of dark compact objects ( cos ) in the universe could be revealed by gravitational lensing of more distant sources was first suggested by press & gunn ( 1973 ) .",
    "the detection of lensed images from any source provides an estimation of the fraction of the universe composed of cos , and therefore the co density .",
    "non - detections offer a viable way to set constraints on the possible values of the co mass , @xmath6 , and density , @xmath7 . depending on the angular separation of the lensed images",
    ", the gravitational lensing effect is classified into _",
    "milli- , micro- , pico- , or femto - lensing_.    there is now overwhelming evidence that the majority of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources lie at cosmological distances ( @xcite ) .",
    "their short duration and the transparency of the universe in gamma rays make grbs ideal probes of dark matter in the form of cos over the mass range @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of lensing a grb depends on co density ( e.g. @xcite ) , but it is estimated to be @xmath10% ( @xcite ) .",
    "multiple images of the same burst can not be angularly resolved by present gamma - ray detectors , but they are easily temporally resolved ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , rather than spatially identifying multiple images of lensed quasars , the lensed grbs must be found by searching such events with identical temporal and spectral signatures .",
    "marani et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have compared the lightcurves of 1235 batse bursts , searching for gravitationally lensed grbs caused by foreground galaxies , with negative results .",
    "the expected time delay between two detectable images can be written as ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the brightness ratio of the two images also known as the dynamic range , @xmath13 is the lens redshift , @xmath14 km @xmath15 is the schwarzchild radius , and @xmath16 is the speed of light .",
    "mao ( 1992 ) found that for a point mass lens , the median value of the time delay is @xmath17 s @xmath18 .    in this paper , we present results of searches for different types of gravitational lensing of grbs , looking for any indication of the presence of dark matter in the form of compact objects .",
    "in all the cases , a monoluminous and non - evolving grb source population is assumed . in  2 , we describe the lensing types , search algorithms performed using batse data ( @xcite ) , and present results .",
    "we summarize and discuss these results in  3 .",
    "in the case of millilensing , the cos have masses between @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "the time delay between the images may vary from few seconds to @xmath22 seconds and their average angular separation is @xmath23 arcseconds . note that @xmath24 is the jean mass at recombination in many early universe scenarios and , consequently , a probable mass scale for dark matter .",
    "gnedin & ostriker ( 1992 ) proposed an open universe model with @xmath25 , filled with black holes of mass @xmath26 , which would dominate the dark matter galactic halos .",
    "nemiroff et al . ( 1993 ) searched the first 44 batse bursts for lensed images that came shortly after the main event by autocorrelating each burst , and no lens candidates were found .",
    "this null result was interpreted by using the detection volume formalism of nemiroff ( 1989 ) , and by modeling the brightness distribution to estimate grb redshifts ( @xcite ) . a standard ( 1,0 )",
    "universe composed to closure density with objects of mass @xmath27 - @xmath28 was marginally ruled out ( @xcite ) .",

    "( 1993 ) and their null results were used to set constraints on the co mass and density for the gnedin & ostriker universe .",
    "mao ( 1993 ) estimated that the lensing probability for this universe is @xmath5 5% . following nemiroff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , for each burst we compute a detection volume between the observer and a burst at @xmath29 , within which the lens with @xmath6 must fall to create a detectable image .",
    "then , all 44 volumes are added and the expected number of detectable lenses in our sample is obtained . for a given ( @xmath30 ) pair , if the expected number is significantly greater than the null result obtained , we rule out such co parameters . for a more detailed explanation of the method , see nemiroff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and marani ( 1998b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] summarizes the results we obtain for the gnedin & ostriker universe .",
    "the figure shows the number of images expected for the 44 grbs and for different ( @xmath31 ) parameters .",
    "the expected number of images for the gnedin & ostriker universe is @xmath5 2.5 - 3 , in good agreement with mao s estimations ( 1993 ) : 2.2 lenses from 44 bursts were expected . since no images were found , the universe with @xmath32 can be excluded at a confidence level of @xmath5 90.0% .",
    "picolensing refers to lensing mass range of @xmath33-@xmath34 .",
    "the expected angular separation is @xmath35 arcseconds and the average time delay is @xmath36 seconds .",
    "the main lens candidates are primordial black holes , molecular clouds , and small planets .",
    "currently , few arguments favor the hypothesis that extremely low mass objects compose a significant fraction of the dark matter .",
    "nevertheless , if such objects were to exist , grb lensing is an efficient method for their detection ( @xcite ) .    for these low mass cos",
    ", the corresponding radius of the einstein ring projected onto our solar system , @xmath37 , will be at most 1 au , @xmath38 .",
    "two spacecraft separated by 1 au or more might see the same grb event with very different amplification since , if the grb were to lie within the @xmath37 of the lens for one spacecraft , it would lie outside @xmath37 for the other spacecraft .",
    "the @xmath39 spacecraft observes the grb with total amplification @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the angular separation between source and lens , and @xmath43 the angular radius of the einstein ring .",
    "there are currently two grb detectors on orbit separated by a distance of at least 1 au : batse and ulysses grb ( @xcite ) .",
    "if batse detects a strong burst while ulysses determines it is a weak burst , the difference in the amplitude may be attributable to a gravitational lensing event due to masses in the range @xmath35- @xmath34 .",
    "we have compared the peak counts of 60 bright bursts which were triggered events in batse and ulysses data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the energy range of ulysses grb detector is @xmath5 20 - 150 kev .",
    "the ulysses triggered data have temporal resolutions of 8- and 32-ms , but they were rebinned into 64-ms count bins",
    ". for batse data , we have used 64-ms concatenated ascii data summed over energy channels 1 and 2 , corresponding to the energy range @xmath5 20 - 100 kev .    once the data were background - subtracted and rebinned , the peak counts and the batse - to - ulysses amplitude ratios , @xmath44 , were calculated .",
    "no evident discrepancy in the amplitude ratios has been found .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows batse peak counts versus ulysses peak counts .",
    "the error bars are obtained assuming poisson counts .",
    "the median value for the ratio , after normalization , is @xmath45 , and the 2-@xmath46 upper and lower confidence levels are 2 and 0.68 , respectively .",
    "a real difference in amplitude should be observable in all three timescales .",
    "we also compared peak counts for 256-ms and 1024-ms time resolutions , although no significant excess was found .",
    "these null results are used to impose limits on the density and mass of cos , again using the detection volume formalism ( @xcite ) . in the case of two observers , where a positive detection requires an amplitude difference between them , the volume within which a point - like lens must fall to create",
    "a discernible magnification is much more complicated than in the millilensing case , and no analytical expression is available . to find the expected number of lenses",
    ", we implemented a monte carlo simulation ( @xcite ) : for each burst in the sample , we randomly draw several lens positions on the lens plane ",
    "fixed at @xmath13 .",
    "we then compute the amplifications each observer would see if the lens is located in that particular position , take the ratio of those amplifications , and check if that ratio is above or below the 2-@xmath46 c.l .",
    "finally , we place the lens plane at another @xmath13 , and re - compute the steps described above . when the lens plane reaches the source plane at @xmath29 , we obtain the detection volume @xmath47 and the expected number of detectable lenses for that particular burst , given by @xmath48 . here , @xmath49 is the co comoving number density .",
    "we then add all volumes of all bursts and repeat the calculations for different co masses and densities .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the results we obtained with this simulation , assuming an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "less than @xmath50 detectable images are expected in our sample .",
    "thus , the mass and density ranges of @xmath51 may be ruled out only at @xmath5 1-@xmath46 statistical significance .",
    "the femtolensing mass range is @xmath6 @xmath5@xmath8-@xmath52 .",
    "the expected image separation is @xmath53 arcseconds , and the average time delay between the images is @xmath54 seconds .",
    "snowballs , primordial black holes , and comets are some examples of these cos",
    ".    these extremely low mass lenses would produce interference fringes in the grb energy spectrum .",
    "these features are evenly separated in energy space and might be confused with cyclotron absorption lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectral lines between 10 and 100 kev were seen in missions like _ konus _ ( @xcite ) , _ heao 1 _ ( @xcite ) , and _ ginga _ ( @xcite ) , and",
    "indeed have been attributed to cyclotron lines due to magnetic fields @xmath55 g. however , these interpretations are still controversial .",
    "briggs ( 1996 ) pointed out that many spectral line analyses performed in these grb data sets used simplistic continuum models and incomplete statistical techniques .",
    "several authors have analyzed batse spectra for spectral line features like the absorption lines detected by _ ginga _ at @xmath5 20 and @xmath5 40 kev ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "briggs et al . (",
    "1998 ) have recently performed a computerized search of 118 bright batse bursts .",
    "they have found only 4 candidates with one possible absorption line , but none of them with evenly spaced , multiple lines .",
    "note that stanek et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and ulmer & goodman ( 1995 ) have argued that the detectability of the femtolensing signature depends on the source size .",
    "the more extended the source , the less pronounced the spectral lines . lines at higher energies are progressively weaker for finite angular extent , since the source appears larger at higher energies . however , the short duration of grbs ( the vast majority lasting from milliseconds to a few tens of seconds ) and their cosmological distances suggest that grbs can be considered compact sources .    assuming that grb sources subtend sufficiently small angular sizes to produce multiple , detectable lines in the spectra , the non - detections of spectral lines in 118 batse bursts by briggs et al .",
    "( 1998 ) can be used to impose lower limits on the mass and density of cos . nemiroff ( 1989 )",
    "estimated that the probability of lensing is @xmath56 if the average distance to the grbs is @xmath57 , or @xmath58 if @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we can rule out , at 95 % confidence levels , universes composed of cos with @xmath60 and @xmath61 the above estimations assume an einstein - de sitter cosmology and point mass lenses .",
    "the non - detections of lensing images in the current grb data have been used , for the first time , to set conservative limits on the composition of dark compact object with masses between @xmath8 and @xmath62 @xmath21 .",
    "different searches in radio , optical , and gamma ray data have been conducted in the past to search for gravitationally lens - induced images caused by masses between @xmath63 and @xmath64 m@xmath65 ( @xcite ) , but no search previous to the present one was carried out for the pico- and femto - lensing cases .",
    "the derived constraints on the density and mass parameters in different mass ranges are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the shaded areas show the excluded values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "light gray shadings represent very weak limits , whereas dark gray shadings are the imposed limits at @xmath5 2-@xmath46 confidence level .",
    "three additional regions are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the cross - hatched area corresponds roughly to the range of values required to explain the macho and eros microlensing results ( @xcite ) . in the millilensing region , a universe proposed by carr & rees ( 1984 ) with ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 is shown as a hatched , very small area .",
    "the constraints previously found by nemiroff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) are also illustrated .",
    "using gravitational lensing data from the millilensing search done by these authors and the detection volume formalism ( @xcite ) , we were able to reject a popular universe proposed by gnedin & ostriker ( 1992 ) with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , at a confidence level of @xmath5 90% .",
    "no search for microlensing events ( @xmath70 5 - 10ms ) in batse archival data was conducted in the present work",
    ". however , nemiroff et al . (",
    "1998 ) have argued that such short events might not be detected by batse due to its threshold setting for 64-ms timescale .",
    "the millilensing and picolensing limits are strong functions of the grb redshift distribution , which is derived by modeling the observed brightness distribution .",
    "this model assumes no rate density evolution , standard candle , and a simple power - law spectrum , @xmath71 .",
    "several authors have recently suggested that the grb rate density is proportional to the star formation rate in the universe ( @xcite ) and that the intrinsic peak luminosities are described by a power - law distribution ( @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "larger redshifts are expected .",
    "therefore , the probability of lensing by cos would increase and the limits imposed on @xmath7 and @xmath6 would be stronger .",
