    "interferometric gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors ligo , geo , tama , and virgo are searching for gw signals with unprecedented sensitivity @xcite . for ligo , the noise levels are already reaching the goal level necessary for the detection of the strongest signals .",
    "it is very important to analyze the detection capabilities of these detectors and to estimate the rates of potentially detectable gw signals .",
    "there is already a considerable list of possible detection candidates ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the inspiral of neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) binaries , the tidal disruption of ns by bh in ns  bh binaries , bh  bh merger and ringdown , low - mass x - ray binaries , pulsars , centrifugally hung - up proto neutron stars in white dwarf accretion - induced collapse , supernova core collapse , gamma ray bursts , and the stochastic background . in this paper",
    "we consider an additional possibility , gws produced by unbound orbits .",
    "as we will show , among unbound orbits near - parabolic encounters ( pes ) produce gravitational radiation with typical frequencies appropriate for detection with terrestrial facilities . for close pes",
    "the gravitational radiation is short and intensive , that is observable to large distances . here",
    ", we estimate the expected event rate of detections for specific current and near - future gw detectors .    initial order - of - magnitude estimates on the detectability of gws emitted during scattering and near collisions of stellar mass compact objects in active galactic nuclei and globular clusters ( gcs )",
    "were made by @xcite .",
    "although their study primarily focused on bh  star , star  star encounters , and did not provide numbers for bh ",
    "bh encounters , they identified these encounters to be `` quite rare '' .",
    "however , @xcite used an overly simplified gc model in which the velocities and masses of all objects were identical , and the spatial distribution was assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "we extend the detection rate estimates to account for the stellar bh mass function , mass segregation , and mass - dependent relative velocities .",
    "we show that this improvement significantly increases the event rate , by approximately a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , interferometric gw detector technology has improved greatly and detailed sensitivity curves are now available .",
    "@xcite estimated a maximum visible distance of @xmath13 , which is a factor of @xmath14 less than advanced ligo s ( adligo ) capabilities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dmax ] below ) , i.e. a factor of @xmath15 less in the accessible volume of sources . combining these factors , our detection rate estimates yield @xmath16 times larger results for adligo .",
    "gravity waves emitted during pes are also important for creating relativistic orbits by gravitational radiation reaction around the supermassive black holes ( smbh ) in the centers of galaxies .",
    "the gws emitted by the later inspiral of the star or compact object around the smbh are possibly detectable by the future space detector _",
    "lisa _ @xcite and also by ground - based detectors for highly eccentric orbits @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we do not consider encounters with smbhs , but focus on the direct detection of gws from unbound orbits of two stellar mass compact objects ( cos ) .",
    "stellar mass unbound orbit encounters are expected to be most likely from dense star clusters with a large fraction of cos . among regular star systems ,",
    "these features are carried by galactic nuclei and gcs , where central densities reach @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 within a region of @xmath19 ",
    "@xmath20 @xcite , the inner regions contain a co fraction of @xmath21 @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we estimate pe event rates for gcs .",
    "as compared to other gw burst sources , the big advantage in detecting pe events is that the possible signal waveforms are much more reliable as the physics behind them is well understood .",
    "the waveforms are known analytically for the case of arbitrary masses moving with arbitrary velocities but at small deflection angles ( often referred to as gravitational bremsstrahlung , see @xcite ) , arbitrary unbound orbits but low velocities in the newtonian approximation @xcite , in the post - newtonian approximation ( pn , * ? ? ?",
    "* including corrections @xmath22 ) , in the 2pn approximation ( @xmath23 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and most recently , in the 3pn approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath24 ) , and the exact numerical solution is available for extreme mass ratios using a schwarzschild background approximation @xcite , and finally , for head - on collisions with large velocities @xcite .",
    "thus , pe waveforms are available for a very large portion of the parameter space .",
    "waveform templates can be constructed a priori , similar to inspirals .",
    "the prior knowledge of the possible waveforms allows the method of matched filtering detection , which helps to reduce the minimum signal - to - noise ratio necessary for a confirmed detection @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : detectors ] , we summarize the relevant characteristics of interferometric gw detectors . in   [ sec : pe waveforms ] , we review the pe waveforms that we adopt . in   [ sec : models ] , we describe the population models that are necessary to estimate the scalings of parameters and the overall pe event rates . in ",
    "[ sec : event rate ] , we derive the expected number of pe event rates , calculate their maximum distance of detection , and estimate the implied rates of successful detections . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions and in   [ sec : discussion ] discuss the limitations and the implications of this work .",
    "the new generation of gw detectors rely on interferometric monitoring of the relative ( differential ) separation of mirrors , which play the role of test masses , responding to space - time distortions induced by the gws as they traverse the detectors .",
    "the effect of a gw is to produce a strain in space , which displaces the mirrors at the ends of the arms by an amount proportional to the effective arm length and gw strain . for gws incident normal to the plane of the detector , and",
    "polarized along the arms of the detector , the mirrors at the ends of the two arms experience differential motion .",
    "waves incident from other directions and/or polarizations also induce differential motion , albeit at a smaller level .",
    "presently , there is an operational international network of first generation interferometric gw detectors : inligo , virgo , tama , and geo ( see   [ sec : intro ] for references ) . the design of advanced terrestrial gw detector adligo and space detector _",
    "lisa _ is well on the way .",
    "there are also plans for a new generation of low - frequency underground detectors especially sensitive for lower frequencies @xcite , which might be especially sensitive to pes , which we will discuss in a separate paper in detail . finally , there are plans for possible future improvements of space detectors : _ decihertz interferometric gravitational - wave observatory ( decigo ) _",
    "@xcite , _ advanced laser interferometer antenna ( alia ) _ and the _ big bang observer ( bbo ) _ @xcite .",
    "their sensitivities , detection frequency bands and capabilities are quite different .",
    "for our purposes , a good approximation is to use : ( 1 . )",
    "the inligo and virgo sensitivity goal ( nearly reached ) to assess present capabilities ; ( 2 . ) the adligo sensitivity goal to assess future capabilities of ground based detectors ; ( 3 . )",
    "the _ lisa _ sensitivity goal to assess future capabilities of initial space based detectors ; and ( 4 . ) the _ next generation lisa _ sensitivity goal to assess the capabilities of possible further extensions to space detectors .",
    "the goal rms noise density per frequency interval for the various detectors , including instrumental and confusion noise , is plotted on figure  [ fig : sensitivity ] .",
    "for ligo we adopt @xcite , for virgo we adopt @xcite but for simplicity discard the narrow features ] , for adligo we adopt the noise estimates from its website ] , and for _ lisa _ , we utilize the online sensitivity curve generator ] for the instrumental noise , and adopt the confusion noise estimate from @xcite .",
    "the noise levels of possible extensions to _ lisa _ named the `` next generation _",
    "lisa _ '' ( _ nglisa _ ) are also provided by the sensitivity curve generator , which we also include in all of our calculations .",
    "this is very similar to the planned sensitivity curve of _ decigo _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the more conservative case therein ) and is just halfway between _ alia _ and _ bbo _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a factor of 3 difference in sensitivity from both ) .",
    "the gw signal waveform for pe is available in a wide range of approximations ( see   [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we adopt @xcite for the angular averaged waveforms , for which the interacting masses travel on classical newtonian trajectories and emit quadrupole radiation .",
    "other features such as spin - spin , spin - orbit interactions , and gravitational recoil , etc . , are higher order perturbations which carry only a small total signal power in typical cases .",
    "therefore for the sake of calculating the signal - to - noise ratio , it is a sufficient first - order approximation to use these waveforms .",
    "illustrative examples of pe waveforms can be found in @xcite ( see fig .  4 and 7 therein ) .",
    "the waveforms are generally constituted of a large amplitude single peak or a jump in the time domain with characteristic time scale @xmath25 , related to the relative angular velocity at the minimum separation @xmath26 . here @xmath27 is the relative velocity at the closest point , and @xmath28 is the corresponding minimum separation .",
    "@xcite provides a closed analytical formula for the total gw radiation energy spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "the spectrum is wide - band , for parabolic orbits it is zero at @xmath30 , it has a maximum near @xmath31 and a half - width @xmath32 .",
    "the characteristic signal amplitude is obtained from the gw energy spectrum as @xcite @xmath33},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the redshift , @xmath35 is the luminosity distance @xcite , and @xmath36 $ ] is the total gw emitted energy of the source at the emitted frequency .",
    "the orientation averaged signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the characteristic signal amplitude ( [ eq : h(f)0 ] ) and @xmath39 is the one - sided spectral noise density ( see   [ sec : detectors ] for references for the particular detectors ) .",
    "note that the relation ( [ eq : snr ] ) refers to an angle - averaged snr obtained from the cube - root of an average of cubed signal amplitudes over different possible orientations of the source and interferometer .",
    "since event rates roughly scale with volume , i.e. distance cubed or @xmath40 , this prescription is useful for estimating event rates @xcite . for signals with optimal orientations , the coefficient @xmath41 in ( [ eq : snr ] )",
    "is changed to 4 .",
    "note furthermore , that the @xmath41 factor is applicable for the detection rate using a single interferometric gw detector .",
    "there are already 4 interferometric gw detectors on earth ( see   [ sec : detectors ] ) , and it is possible that there will be a lot more in the future . a coincident analysis with multiple detectors can be used to improve the efficiency by increasing the total signal - to - noise ratio and also by insuring that at least one detector is close to the optimal orientation @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath41 in ( [ eq : snr ] ) is most likely pessimistic . for 1 detector in the optimal orientation and @xmath42 identical detectors in random orientations",
    "a quick scaling of the coefficient is @xmath43 . on the other hand , a relatively large @xmath44",
    "might be required to keep the false alarm rate at a sufficiently low level . for a conservative estimate on the pe rate",
    "we do not modify the @xmath41 factor in the definition of @xmath45 ( [ eq : snr ] ) and evaluate results for @xmath46 .",
    "the pe waveforms can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : h(f)0 ] ) by substituting the @xmath47 relationship specific for pes using @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the redshifted chirp mass if @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the masses of the interacting objects , @xmath52 is the redshifted characteristic frequency , f denotes the observed gw frequency , and @xmath53 is the @xcite normalized dimensionless energy spectrum for dimensionless frequency @xmath54 , for which @xmath55 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : h(f)1 ] ) is the leading order ( i.e. newtonian ) approximation to the gw waveform , @xmath56 .",
    "a remarkably advantageous feature of the waveform in this approximation is that it depends on only a single combination of the orbital parameters , @xmath57 .",
    "although we need only utilize this form ( [ eq : h(f)1 ] ) , we briefly note that it is also possible to express the waveform with the separation at closest point @xmath28 in the center of mass frame @xcite : @xmath58}.\\ ] ] here @xmath59 is the redshifted characteristic frequency for fixed initial velocity as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the gw amplitude spectrum @xmath60 is roughly flat at low frequencies @xmath61 , and decreases for higher frequencies .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : h(t)2 ] ) shows that @xmath60 scales with @xmath62 for frequencies larger than the cutoff at @xmath63 .",
    "modifications are necessary for relativistic encounters .",
    "the relativistic gravitational radiation waveforms and energy output has been calculated by @xcite in the quadrupole approximation for a test particle approaching a schwarzschild black hole from infinity on a quasi - parabolic geodesic . in case",
    "the periastron distance @xmath28 is close to the unstable circular orbit , the gw energy is significantly increased ( it has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the total schwarzschild radius , and a factor of @xmath67 increase for @xmath68 or a factor of @xmath69 for @xmath70 ) .",
    "we adopt the fitting formula of @xcite , which is correct within @xmath71 for orbits that avoid a collision , and scale the amplitudes of the @xcite waveforms ( [ eq : h(f)1 ] ) according to the increase of the gw energy , @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 note once again , that the dimensionless periastron distance , @xmath74 , is uniquely specified by the characteristic frequency , @xmath75 .",
    "we derive explicit formulae for @xmath76 in the non - relativistic newtonian and relativistic geodesic approximations , when considering the dynamics of pes in   [ sec : sub : rate1 ] and   [ sec : sub : relativistic ] below . quite remarkably , the characteristic frequency of the waveform is unchanged for relativistic orbits .",
    "therefore , we do not explore the effects of relativistic modifications in the shape of the gw signal waveform , we restrict only to correcting the amplitude .",
    "the major contribution to the pe event rate is expected from dense star clusters with a large co fraction .",
    "the most important systems carrying these properties are possibly gcs and galactic nuclei . in this paper",
    "we focus on gcs , but simple analytical scaling of the results allows a straightforward extension to galactic nuclei or any other population of spherical star systems .",
    "the spatial distribution of gcs exactly traces the distribution of galactic halos @xcite in the local universe . in this section",
    "we summarize the galaxy distribution and the gc abundance per galaxy , and describe the gc models which we adopt for the paper .",
    "we utilize the local distribution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the accumulated number of galaxies to distance @xmath77 can be well approximated by @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are 23 , 62 , 1100 , and 26000 , respectively .",
    "the average density of faraway galaxies is @xmath83 , but the local galaxy abundance is much denser than average . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_gal ] ) @xmath84 has a @xmath85 jump at the virgo cluster at @xmath86 .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath87 for the average gc abundance in the universe .",
    "we roughly account for the clustering of gcs in the local universe by assuming that the distribution of gcs follow the abundance of galaxies .",
    "this assumption is consistent with observations @xcite suggesting that the population of gcs represent a universal , old halo population that is present around all galaxies .",
    "the number of gcs within a distance @xmath77 is then @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a scaling constant relating the abundance of gcs and galaxies . using the large scale average @xmath90 @xcite and @xmath91 eq .  ( [ eq : n_gal ] ) for @xmath92 we get @xmath93 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath89 can be interpreted as the number of gcs per galaxy averaged over all morphological types .",
    "concerning pe detection rates , we shall show in   [ sec : sub : dist ] that typical observation distances for terrestrial detectors are larger than the clustering scale ( [ eq : n_gal ] ) .",
    "therefore , the results are sensitive to mainly the average abundance and are only slightly increased by the local clustering of gcs .",
    "the value @xmath87 for the average abundance is a conservative assumption . in their quick estimate",
    "@xcite derived this value by adding up the contribution of galaxies of morphological types sab , e - s0 , and blue ellipticals .",
    "recently , 12 nearby edge on spiral galaxies were examined , resulting in much larger numbers , reaching @xmath94 gcs for these particular galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition to the morphological types considered in @xcite , dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies also contribute to the overall gc numbers @xcite .",
    "the gc content of 69 dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies have been estimated to host about a dozen gcs per de galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results on detection rates correspond only to lower limits , which has to be scaled linearly with @xmath95 when more detailed estimates become available .",
    "the gc distribution given by ( [ eq : n_gal][eq : n_gc ] ) is only valid for sub - cosmological scales . assuming that @xmath77 denotes the luminosity distance , @xmath96 , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n_gal][eq : n_gc ] ) which is a direct observable using the gw amplitude , the change in the cosmological volume element decreases the average density .",
    "@xmath97 we adopt the cosmological volume element @xcite for a @xmath98cdm cosmology with @xmath99 consistent with recent observations of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ and the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "we find that the uncorrected volume element @xmath100 is reduced by a factor of 0.7 for @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) and by a factor of 0.053 for @xmath3 ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "since gcs are believed to represent an old halo population in galaxies , we do not account for additional possible cosmological evolution of the comoving gc abundance .      here",
    "we define the gc models that we use to obtain typical pe parameters and event rates .",
    "first we define the common features that are the same for both of our models .",
    "we assume a total of @xmath104 stellar mass stars , @xmath105 , spherically distributed within a typical radius @xmath106 . also within the cluster ,",
    "is a co population consisting of @xmath107 objects with @xmath108 that move in the background gravitational potential of the stars .",
    "we define the `` typical co mass '' as @xmath109 .",
    "we adopt typical values of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , with @xmath113 , and @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "we construct two different models for the distribution of mass , spatial coordinate , and velocities of stars .",
    "model i is a simple plausible model to get the scaling of pe event rates on different cluster parameters . here",
    "we assume a homogeneous spherical distribution , and the cos within the cluster have the same mass and magnitudes of velocities . in model",
    "ii , we refine the assumptions to account for the distributions of masses , mass segregation , and relative velocity distributions .    by comparing models i and ii , we find that while model i gives the correct @xmath106 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath75 scalings , it underestimates the total event rate of a single gc by 2 orders of magnitudes .",
    "the comparison of models i and ii is necessary ( i ) to understand the origin of the large increase in pe event rates as compared to @xcite , and ( ii ) to understand the impact on the bh mass function of gcs on pe event rates .",
    "it is therefore emphasized that the gc model assumptions have a crucial importance when determining the pe event rate .",
    "we believe that our model ii includes all of the essential features of gcs for the assessment of pe rates , and uncertainties are comprised of the uncertainties in the model parameters rather than additional fundamental processes for a discussion ) . ] .      for the most simple model , the spatial distribution is assumed to be uniform within a characteristic radius @xmath106 , and it is assumed that all cos have the same mass @xmath117 and magnitude of velocity @xmath118 .",
    "the orientation of velocities is isotropic , implying a velocity dispersion of @xmath119 .",
    "for this simple model , we estimate the relative velocity distribution of cos to be the same as the individual velocities @xmath120 .",
    "the characteristic velocities can be obtained from the virial theorem for a uniform distribution of mass factor of eq .",
    "[ eq : v_vir ] , which becomes @xmath121 in that case ( e.g. @xcite ) . ] : @xmath122    the pe event rate is calculated as the rate of scattering on a fixed target lattice , with incident velocity @xmath118 .",
    "we improve model i with the following factors .",
    "the validity and motivation of these assumptions is discussed below the list .    1 .",
    "we assume an equal number of nss and bhs @xmath123 .",
    "we introduce @xmath124^{-1}\\,m^{-1}$ ] for the fractional distribution of bh masses among cos with mass @xmath125 per mass interval @xmath126 , in the range @xmath127 , with @xmath128 .",
    "we define the ns mass distribution @xmath129 as a gaussian distribution with norm 0.5 , mean @xmath130 , and variance @xmath131 .",
    "finally we define the co distribution by @xmath132 , which has a unit norm . for definiteness , we take @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , implying that @xmath136 and @xmath137 , but also calculate detection rates for more general bh mass distributions .",
    "the pe detection rates are practically independent of the actual total number and distribution of nss .",
    "we account for the mass segregation by assuming thermal equipartition among cos , objects with mass @xmath125 have a velocity @xmath138 , and are confined within a radius , @xmath139 , while regular stars are distributed uniformly within a sphere of radius @xmath106 , as in model i. since @xmath140 , the background gravitational potential is determined by regular stars .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] for an illustration .",
    "for core collapsed models a modified scaling is necessary ( see text below ) .",
    "the relative velocity for cos with masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 is assumed to be @xmath141^{1/2}v_{{\\mathrm{vir}}}$ ] .",
    "the bh mass distribution is crucial for the analysis , since signal rates scale with @xmath142 ( see   [ sec : event rate ] and the appendix below ) .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis of bh mass functions have not yet converged .",
    "recent x - ray observations display evidence for 20 galactic bhs with masses between @xmath143 @xcite , and @xmath144 ultra - luminous x - ray sources are identified with intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) with masses @xmath145 ",
    "@xmath146 @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions from two - dimensional simulations of stellar core collapse @xcite lead to masses smaller than @xmath147 with very different distributions depending on the assumptions ( fraction of explosion energy used to unbind the star , stellar winds , mass transfer after helium ignition ) .",
    "sophisticated simulations of the initial phase of rapid star evolution assuming a lower metallicity for the progenitor stars ( weaker stellar winds ) appropriate for gcs and including a large fraction of binaries , collisions , and accretion leading to the mass buildup of bhs imply an initial smooth decreasing distribution of stellar - mass bhs with masses up to @xmath148  @xmath149 @xcite depending on model assumptions and cluster environments .",
    "results are valid for timescales short compared to later dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "however , the final fate of the cluster remains highly uncertain .",
    "in small gcs , dynamical interactions of binaries might eject a significant portion of the stellar - mass bh population @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we adopt @xmath150 leaving the minimum and maximum masses free parameters . however , most recent population synthesis simulations @xcite typically yield steeper bh mass functions .",
    "for this reason we felt it important to compute results for other distributions @xmath151 with @xmath152 , 1 , and 2 , as well .",
    "concerning the other parameters , in our standard model we take @xmath153 and @xmath154 , for which @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and assume @xmath133 , but also calculate results for other @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 values .",
    "the ns mass distribution that we utilize is supported by observations of 26 radio pulsars and 4 x - ray binaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the distribution is sharply peaked around @xmath160 .",
    "our assumption on the total number of nss ( @xmath161 ) is somewhat arbitrary , values could be higher or lower depending on what fraction of nss are ejected by kicks during their formation .",
    "our detection rate estimates can be scaled to the appropriate value using @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( see   [ sec : event rate ] below ) .",
    "note however , that in   [ sec : event rate ] we show that ns interactions contribute a negligible fraction of the pe event rate ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ratemass ] and [ fig : ratemassratio ] below ) .    note that we do not consider encounters between white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "the detection of pes between wds are even worse than for nss , since wd masses are even smaller @xcite .",
    "our final results show that the pe detection rates roughly scale with @xmath164 , implying that rates are enormously suppressed for wds : by a factor of @xmath165 relative to @xmath166 bhs , which are typical for detection ( see fig .  [ fig : ratemass ] ) .",
    "moreover , wds are disrupted by tidal torques for close encounters , at sub - hz frequencies .",
    "therefore , pes of wds are completely invisible for terrestrial detectors .",
    "the second improvement is to account for mass segregation .",
    "the differentiation of the stellar population with mass within the cluster core is a consequence of thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "objects with masses larger than @xmath167 had enough time to relax to thermal equilibrium within the lifetime of the gcs @xcite .",
    "this means that the kinetic energies of each of the component stars are drawn from the same distribution , implying that the typical speed of an object of mass @xmath125 is @xmath168 , causing the object to sink to the core of the cluster . for a nearly homogeneous distribution of background stars",
    ", this implies that the maximum radius available to a given mass is @xmath169 @xcite . for the bh distribution given by @xmath170 we get",
    "that bhs with mass @xmath171 ( which make the dominant contribution to pe rates , see figs .",
    "[ fig : ratemass ] and [ fig : ratemassratio ] below ) are confined to a radius @xmath172 .",
    "note that our scalings based on thermal equipartition might not hold in case spitzer instability leads to core collapse , creating a dynamically decoupled core of high mass bhs ( typically @xmath173@xmath174 depending on the fraction of primordial binaries , @xcite ) .",
    "we can account for core collapse by simply scaling our final results on detection rates appropriately with @xmath175 ( see   [ sec : sub : corecollapse ] for a discussion ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the assumption on the relative velocity .",
    "the velocity distribution of stars in gcs is well described by the king - michie ( km ) model @xcite , which is roughly a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution with a maximum velocity cutoff .",
    "it is well - known that the relative velocity distribution for mb individual velocity distributions is also mb for the reduced mass @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath177^{1/2}v_{{\\mathrm{vir}}}$ ] .",
    "note that we do not utilize the exact velocity distribution , but associate the same fixed velocity value for every object with identical masses .",
    "relaxing this approximation and accounting for mb velocity distributions leads to a change of only a few percent in the encounter rate results ( the correction is @xmath178 for model i in the range of gw detector frequencies , see @xcite for the derivation ) .",
    "thus , the velocity distribution can be safely approximated with the mean value .",
    "a simple explanation is the fact that gw detector frequencies correspond to unbound encounters with nearly parabolic trajectories , for which the exact value of the initial velocity is negligible ( see   [ sec : sub : rate1 ] below ) .    the pe event rate for component masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 is calculated as the rate of scattering with incident velocity equal to the initial relative velocity @xmath179 .",
    "we now derive the event rate for the successful detection of pe signals using the two models of gcs .",
    "this section is divided in five parts . in   [ sec : sub : rate1 ] we derive the comoving event rate per comoving characteristic frequency bins for individual gcs for the two population models . in   [ sec : sub : relativistic ] we derive the modifications necessary for relativistic encounters . in   [ sec : sub : dist ] we determine the signal - to - noise ratio using the specific detector sensitivity curves and determine the maximum observable distance of pes . in   [ sec : sub : rate3 ] , we add up the contributions of all possible gcs within the visible distance and estimate the pe detection rates . finally in   [",
    "sec : sub : rateresult ] we conclude the results of the analysis .        when calculating the detectable event rates for specific gw detectors , it is desirable to express the encounter cross section for particular @xmath75 frequency bins .",
    "to achieve this we first compute the interaction cross - sections for given masses and initial orbital parameters . then",

    "an even more significant source of uncertainty is the mass distribution of bhs in the clusters .",

    "recent simulations of rapid star evolution assuming a lower metallicity for the progenitor stars ( weaker stellar winds ) appropriate for gcs and including a large fraction of binaries , collisions , and accretion leading to the mass buildup of bhs imply a stellar - mass bh distribution with maximum bh masses around @xmath614  @xmath149 @xcite .",

    "we have assumed a simple mass segregation , based on thermal equipartition among the specific co components .",
    "this assumption is in fact valid only among the decoupled high mass components within the core .",
    "@xcite has shown that in simple two - component systems consisting of masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath616 , global equipartition can not be attained if the low - mass component determines the potential everywhere in the cluster . in this case , the high mass components become dynamically decoupled from the rest of the cluster , and the cluster core collapses to a much smaller radius , @xmath617 .",

    "since pes are very sensitive to the number of higher mass stellar bhs ( figs .",

    "the maximum distance of a matched filtering detection at a characteristic frequency of @xmath650 with angular - averaged signal - to - noise ratio @xmath1 is 0.33 , 0.62 , 4.5 , 0 , and @xmath651 for inligo , virgo , adligo , _ lisa _ , and _ nglisa _ , respectively .",
    "the final result for the detection rate after the compilation of the full analysis described in the paper gives @xmath652 , @xmath653 , @xmath654 , @xmath655 , and @xmath656 , respectively .",

    "it is 9 orders of magnitudes smaller than the event rates estimates for pbh binary coalescence in one milky way sized galaxy @xcite .",
    "another extension of the present analysis is to estimate the number of low @xmath290 pe events , adding an unresolved astrophysical background to the gw detector noise budget similar to the unresolved wd background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and unresolved capture sources @xcite . since pe rates are progressively larger for progressively smaller characteristic frequencies , @xmath75 , and since all pe waveforms extend to gw frequencies @xmath657 , pe background will be most substantial for space detectors , especially around the minimum frequency noise wall ( @xmath658@xmath659 ) .",
    "the total number of pe events within a distance @xmath77 , can be obtained from ( [ eq : dnu2 ] ) neglecting cosmology as @xmath660 where @xmath299 is the maximum frequency for pes avoiding a collision ( [ eq : fmmax ] ) , which drops out to leading order if @xmath661 . for @xmath662 and @xmath663 @xmath664",
    "we get one event every @xmath665 @xmath666 , which corresponds to @xmath667 @xmath668 events for a @xmath669 ( @xmath659 ) frequency bin .",
    "if core contraction enhances pe rates by a factor of @xmath670 ( see   [ sec : sub : corecollapse ] ) , we get @xmath671 @xmath672 events per frequency bin .",
    "these events will typically have a very low signal - to - noise ratio , e.g. for a single pe encounter with @xmath673 for @xmath588 at @xmath674 we get @xmath675 , and @xmath676 yields @xmath677 for _ lisa_. assuming that average unresolved pe noise accumulates proportional to @xmath678 , we get a net amplitude of only @xmath679 or @xmath680 for _ lisa _ even in the core contracted case for frequencies @xmath669 or @xmath659 , respectively .",
