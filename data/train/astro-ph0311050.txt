    "prior to the detection of afterglows , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were enshrouded in mystery for nearly thirty years .",
    "great progress in our understanding of these energetic events came with the first redshift measurement which placed grbs at cosmological distances @xcite . in a similar fashion",
    ", the mystery of x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) has been fueled by the absence of confirmed redshifts .",
    "these events , identified in the 1990s by _ bepposax _ , are characterized by a peak energy in @xmath1 of @xmath2 kev ( compared to @xmath3 kev for grbs ) . with a distribution of durations similar to those observed for grbs ,",
    "it has been assumed that xrfs are associated with grbs and therefore share their extragalactic distance scale @xcite .",
    "the subsequent discovery of xrf x - ray and radio afterglows with properties similar to those observed in grb afterglows has further strengthened this association @xcite . still , the question of whether the difference between grbs and xrfs is intrinsic or extrinsic remains unanswered .",
    "assuming xrfs are simply grbs observed away from the jet collimation axis , they would have less @xmath4-ray emission and the difference is extrinsic , based solely on the line - of - sight to the observer . on the other hand , the difference could be intrinsic , namely xrfs may represent a class of explosions which are similar in energetics to grbs yet characterized by less relativistic ejecta possibly due to a heavier baryonic load .",
    "it is clear that by setting the distance scale for xrfs ( and hence their energy scale ) we can begin to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic effects .    in this paper",
    "we present the first spectroscopic redshift for an x - ray flash , xrf 020903 , placing this event among the nearest high energy explosions and offering confirmation that x - ray flashes are cosmological and produce a total energy output similar to that observed in grbs .",
    "on 2002 september 3.421 ut the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ) and soft x - ray camera ( sxc ) aboard the high energy transient explorer-2 ( hete-2 ) detected an x - ray flash within the 0.5 - 10 kev energy band . with an exceptionally low peak energy of @xmath5 kev and a fluence of @xmath6 , xrf 020903 is the softest event ever detected by hete-2 with a ratio of x - ray fluence ( @xmath7 ) to @xmath4-ray fluence ( @xmath8 ) of log(@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "ground analysis provided a localization for xrf 020903 centered at @xmath10 , @xmath11 with a @xmath12 uncertainty region at @xmath13 days @xcite .",
    "we began observing the field of xrf 020903 on 2002 september 4.32 ut ( @xmath14 days ) with the palomar observatory 200-inch telescope ( p200 ) equipped with the large field camera ( lfc ) . with a total exposure time of 20 minutes under photometric conditions ( stellar @xmath15 )",
    "the observations reached a limiting magnitude of @xmath16 mag .",
    "visual comparison with digitized sky survey archival images did not reveal an afterglow candidate .",
    "a second epoch was obtained on september 10.30 ut ( @xmath177 days ) using the same observational set - up and in similar observing conditions .",
    "image subtraction between the first and second epochs revealed one variable object within the hete-2 error region ( figure  [ fig : xrf020903-field ] ) located at @xmath18 , @xmath19 and lying @xmath20 arcsec nw of a bright elliptical galaxy ( hereafter g2 ; @xcite ) .    with an approximate magnitude of @xmath21 at @xmath22 day ,",
    "the new object decreased in brightness by 1.4 magnitudes between the two epochs , implying a temporal flux decay index of @xmath23 .",
    "as the source proved consistent with a typical grb afterglow evolution , the optical transient was adopted as a suitable candidate for the optical afterglow of xrf 020903 .",
    "we observed the afterglow position on three additional epochs with the p200 and the mdm observatory 1.3 meter telescope ( table  [ tab : optical - photometry ] and figure  [ fig : xrf020903-optical ] ) .",
    "these , along with digitized sky survey archival images , reveal the presence of an extended source with @xmath24 mag coincident with the position of the transient and thereby suggestive of a host galaxy ( hereafter g1 ) .    due to the underlying extended source and the proximity of the transient to g2 , accurate magnitude estimates relied on careful psf photometry of the field .",
    "absolute calibration of field stars was supplied by @xcite .",
    "we used 12 unsaturated field stars in common between the palomar and henden images to fully calibrate observations of the variable source .",
    "we note that although the transient decreased in brightness quickly between the first two epochs , later epochs ( @xmath25 days ) appear to indicate a plateau in the light curve which was confirmed by other observers @xcite and may originate from unresolved flux contamination from g1 .",
    "initial spectroscopy of the transient was performed on 2002 september 28.1 ut with the magellan baade telescope using the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss2 ) .",
    "a position angle of 168 degrees was used such that spectral information on g1 and g2 was obtained simultaneously . despite the positional coincidence of g2 and g1 , it was found that the systems are not physically associated , separated by 3900 km / s in velocity space @xcite . in this epoch ,",
    "the transient source was still significantly bright .",
    "further spectroscopic observations were made of the putative host ( g1 ) with the echelle spectrograph @xmath26 imager ( esi ) mounted on the keck ii telescope on 2003 july 4 ut ( @xmath27 days ) .",
    "these observations do not include any flux from the transient source . during a total exposure time of 1 hour",
    ", we obtained a spectrum of g1 and g2 with a slit width of 0.75 arcsec .",
    "we find that g2 is a large elliptical galaxy with at least one interacting galaxy companion , g3 , located @xmath28  to the ne ( see figure  [ fig : xrf020903-hst ] ) .",
    "observations of g2 exhibit a relatively smooth continuum with features typical of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the ca ii h and k absorption lines give a redshift of @xmath29 , while g3 is offset by only 240 km / s at a redshift of @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , g1 is shown to be an active star - forming galaxy at z=0.251 with a rich set of narrow bright emission lines ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the [ oiii]/h@xmath31 and [ nii]/h@xmath32 intensity ratios indicate that the galaxy is a low - metallicity and high - excitation starburst galaxy .",
    "in addition , the flux ratio of the [ neiii ] and [ oii ] lines is @xmath33 , similar to the observed value for the host galaxy of grb 970508 @xcite and approximately 10 times higher than typical values for h ii regions .",
    "the bright [ neiii ] emission lines observed in grb hosts are thought to be indicative of a substantial population of massive stars . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite note that a spectrum of g1 taken with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) on the keck i telescope reveals a deficit of emission at rest wavelengths @xmath34 which is consistent with a population of older stars .",
    "the afterglow candidate was observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) under program no.9405 ( p.i .",
    ": a. fruchter ) .",
    "three epochs of imaging were obtained from @xmath35 to @xmath36 days with exposure times of 1840 sec in the f606w filter .",
    "following `` on - the - fly '' pre - processing the data were drizzled using standard iraf tools ( stsdas ; @xcite ) . in drizzling our final images , we retained the native wfc pixel scale of 0.05  and used a pixfrac of 1.0 .",
    "the hst images reveal a complex galaxy morphology for g1 , suggesting a system of at least four interacting galaxies ( see figure  [ fig : xrf020903-hst ] ) .",
    "to locate the optical transient with respect to the host galaxy complex , we performed a source to source comparison of our first - epoch palomar ( 2002 september 4 ) and hst ( 2002 december 3 ) images .",
    "we found 42 unsaturated , unconfused sources in common between these two images , and were able to match the two coordinate lists with an rms mapping uncertainty of 0.06  arcsec .",
    "we derived the position of the transient from the difference image of the 2002 september 4 and september 10 data .",
    "since the optical transient is well - detected in the difference image , the uncertainty in its centroid position is negligible .",
    "the uncertainty in the coordinate mapping thus dominates the uncertainty in the position of the source relative to the host galaxy complex .",
    "the optical transient appears to overlap with the sw component of the g1 complex ( figure  [ fig : xrf020903-hst ] ) .",
    "we began observations of the field of xrf 020903 with the very large array ( vla ) on 2002 september 27.22 ut . a radio source was detected in coincidence with the optical transient at a location of @xmath37 with an uncertainty of 0.1 arcsec in each coordinate .",
    "the initial observation showed the radio source to have a flux density of @xmath38 mjy at 8.5 ghz . the national radio astronomy observatory vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite )",
    "did not show any evidence for a pre - existing source at this location down to a limit of 1 mjy .",
    "further observations at 8.5 ghz on september 29.11 ( @xmath39 days ) showed that the source faded to @xmath40 mjy .",
    "we continued monitoring the transient source with the vla over the next @xmath41 days at frequencies of 1.5 , 4.9 , 8.5 and 22.5 ghz .",
    "the lightcurve is displayed in figure  [ fig : xrf020903-radio ] .",
    "the relatively low redshift and strong radio emission of the transient source made it an ideal candidate for very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations .",
    "on september 30.23 ut ( @xmath42 days ) we observed the radio transient for a total duration of 6 hours at 8.5 ghz . using sources j2253 + 1608 and",
    "j2148 + 0657 we were able to flux calibrate the field and we phase referenced against source j2256 - 2011 at a distance of @xmath43 degrees .",
    "data were reduced and processed using standard vlba packages within the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "we detected the radio transient with a flux of @xmath44 mjy at a position coincident with the vla and optical observations at a location of @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "this is our most accurate position measurement for the transient object .",
    "the source is unresolved within our vlba beam size of @xmath47 mas .",
    "furthermore , the consistency between the flux measured with vlba and low resolution vla observations rules out the presence of diffuse components ( e.g. jets ) .",
    "the large error box and the proximity of the optical transient to g2 and g3 delayed rapid identification of the transient @xcite . as a result",
    "there was little optical followup of the transient at early times ( see table  [ tab : optical - photometry ] ) . at later times , the transient is rapidly dominated by the emission from g1 .",
    "an additional complication was introduced by @xcite who , based on archival photographic plates from 1954 and 1977 , proposed that g1 hosted a variable active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "in contrast to the above discussion , the extensive radio light curve ( figure  [ fig : xrf020903-radio ] ) provides strong evidence that the transient is the afterglow of xrf 020903 .",
    "the radio light curve is similar to the afterglow of grbs @xcite . at 4.9 ghz",
    ", the source was observed to rise to a peak flux at @xmath48 days and subsequently decay with a characteristic index of @xmath49 .",
    "a steeper decline of @xmath50 was observed at 8.5 ghz where the peak flux precedes the first observational epoch .",
    "we note that the dynamic range of the radio afterglow emission clearly distinguishes the source from a radio bright agn .",
    "the afterglow interpretation is consistent with the optical spectroscopic observations of g1 , namely the absence of broad lines or features typical of agn , as well as the absence of any jet structure in the vlba images of the radio transient .",
    "we proceed accepting the notion that the optical / radio transient is the afterglow of xrf 020903 .",
    "at a redshift of @xmath0 , the x - ray fluence implies an isotropic equivalent energy @xmath51 erg .",
    "this value is 3 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than the isotropic energies of gamma - ray bursts @xcite . since there is no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow observations , the data are consistent with a wide jet or a spherical explosion .",
    "this , along with the early decline of the optical flux ( @xmath52 at @xmath53 d ; figure  [ fig : xrf020903-optical ] ) rules out the possibility that the inferred low energy is due to a viewing angle significantly away from the jet axis . in such a scenario ,",
    "the optical flux would rise until the edge of the jet enters the observer s line of sight , peaking at @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the observed time of the jet break ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : xrf020903-grb - radio - hist ] shows that although the energy in the prompt emission of xrf 020903 is significantly lower than that observed for typical grbs , the peak luminosity of the radio afterglow is comparable to that found in grb afterglows .",
    "this indicates that xrf 020903 has a similar kinetic energy to grb afterglows . to study this in more detail we used standard broadband afterglow models with spherical and collimated ejecta expanding into circumburst media with uniform density and wind density profile , @xmath56 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we find that independent of the assumed model , the total kinetic energy is @xmath57 erg with reasonable values for the circumburst density and energy fractions ( electron and magnetic field ) of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "thus we confirm the afterglow energy is similar to values found for grb afterglows @xcite .",
    "recent evidence suggests a standard total energy yield ( @xmath61 erg ) for all grbs @xcite , where the total energy yield ( @xmath62 ) is defined as the sum of the energy in the prompt emission ( @xmath63 ) plus the mildly relativistic energy as inferred from the afterglow ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "clearly , for xrf 020903 the explosion energy is dominated by the mildly relativistic afterglow , while a minor fraction of energy couples to the high lorentz factors characterizing the prompt emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : xrf020903-grb - radio - hist ] also compares the radio luminosity of xrf 020903 with other spherical explosions ",
    "type ibc supernovae . with a radio luminosity @xmath65 times greater than typical ibc sne ,",
    "it is clear that xrf 020903 is a significantly more energetic explosion .",
    "this suggests that despite their similar explosion geometries , xrf 020903 and type ibc supernovae are intrinsically different  possibly due to the presense of a central engine @xcite .",
    "we present radio and optical observations of the afterglow of xrf 020903  the first x - ray flash to have a detected optical afterglow and a spectroscopic distance determination . at a redshift of @xmath0 ,",
    "this burst has set the distance scale for xrfs and confirmed the assumption that they are cosmological in origin .",
    "the host galaxy of xrf 020903 appears to be a typical star - forming galaxy similar to those of grb host galaxies .    the isotropic energy release of the prompt ( x - ray ) emission of xrf 020903 is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those of grbs .",
    "however , from our broadband modeling of the afterglow we determine that the total kinetic energy is about @xmath66erg , not dissimilar to those inferred for grbs @xcite . in comparison with a larger sample of cosmic explosions ,",
    "xrf 020903 is a clear example where less energy is coupled to high lorentz factors .",
    "this source highlights the diversity in high energy transients and underscores the importance of studying spherical explosions .",
