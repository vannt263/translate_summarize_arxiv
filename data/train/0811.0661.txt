    "our notion about the universe and the structure of the spacetime in which we live have been radically changed by the existence of additional spacelike dimensions in nature .",
    "it is well known that the hierarchy problem , which is why the characteristic scale of gravity ( @xmath0 ) is about 16 orders of magnitude larger than the electro - weak scale ( @xmath1 ) , is solved successfully both in add model @xcite and rs model @xcite @xcite . in the former @xcite , arakani - hamed et al .",
    "suggest that compact extra dimensions can be as large as submillimeter scale and our 4d world is a lower - dimensional brane where all the matter is concentrated .",
    "that is , except for gravitons and scalar particles without charges are allowed to propagate in the bulk , all the other standard model particles are compressed on the 3-brane .",
    "soon after , randall and sundrum present a different proposal that a noncompact spacelike fifth dimension is permitted to exist .",
    "rs 2-brane model @xcite with a small extra dimension and rs 1-brane model @xcite with a large extra dimension are build up . as a result of the instability of the vacuum in a strong gravitational field , the black hole can radiate various particles @xcite .",
    "people usually call it hawking radiation or black hole radiation . based upon this momentous theory ,",
    "many works are explored about the entroy of black holes ( see @xcite-@xcite ) , the quasi - normal models ( for a review , see @xcite @xcite @xcite ) , and so on",
    ".    the 5d ricci - flat schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) black hole , which contains a induced cosmological constant , originates from the canonial 1-body solution in the background of the space - time - matter ( stm ) theory ( @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "recently , this solution is embedded into a brane world by using a conformial factor @xcite and constitute a 5d ricci - flat sds black string space .",
    "this black string space is the rs 2-brane model",
    ". surfaces of constant @xmath2 , which is the fifth dimension coordinate , satisfy the israel equations .",
    "a reflection symmetric domain wall is in this spacetime .",
    "the potential surrounding the black string has a quantized spectrum as well as a continuous one by considering the standing wave condition between its two branes .",
    "soon , with the tangent approximation , the real scalar field equation is solved numerically in paper @xcite . then the extreme case nariai black hole is studied in the later work @xcite .",
    "the decay of scalar field is more and more fierce with the increasing induced cosmological constant . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to study nariai case with a new approach  polynomial approximation .",
    "nariai solution was presented by nariai in the 1950s @xcite and discussed by many literatures as one of important cases in the singular spaces @xcite .",
    "it is the exact solution to the einstein equation with positive cosmological constant without a maxwell field .",
    "meanwhile , it has a topological structure of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional de sitter spacetime with a round 2-sphere of fixed radius , i.e. @xmath3 . here we study the massless scalar field about this extreme case in the 5d ricci - flat sds black string space . using a polynomial as the fitting function which is more accurate than previous tangent approximation @xcite , we solve the full boundary problem numerically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the background of this model . the 5d black string space and the two horizons of the space are presented . in section",
    "iii , assuming the scalar field is separable , we decompose the scalar field equation successfully . in section iv ,",
    "the master propagating equation with schrdinger - like form is obtained via the tortoise coordinate transformation . in section",
    "v , with the boundary conditions and the polynomial approximation , we obtain a full boundary value problem .",
    "then the schrdinger - like equation is solved numerically .",
    "we finish with a summary of our result in the last section .",
    "we use the metric signature with diagonal @xmath4 and put @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 equal to unity .",
    "lower - case greek letters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 will be taken to run over @xmath11 as usual , while upper - case latin letters @xmath12 runs over all five coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "we start our analysis by presenting an exact 5d black hole solution .",
    "the line element of the 5d ricci - flat sds black hole takes the form @xcite @xmath14-d\\xi^2,\\label{5dmetric}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 @xmath16 is the open non - compact extra dimension coordinate , @xmath17 is the mass of the black hole , and @xmath18 is the induced cosmological constant .",
    "the original aim of solution ( [ 5dmetric ] ) , which is one of important results of stm theory , is used to solve the canonical 1-body problem which is the 1-body solution can not be ruled out by solar system tests @xcite . considering the 5d uniqueness theorem , metric ( [ 5dmetric ] )",
    "is introduced to describe the field outside an object like the sun .",
    "this solution satisfies the 5d vacuum equation @xmath19 therefore , we can deduce a notable character of this space from ( [ 5dmetric ] ) and ( [ vacueq ] ) .",
    "that is , the space is empty ( no matter ) when viewing from the 5d .",
    "however , viewing from the 4d ( corresponds to @xmath20 ) , the matter is induced from the empty 5d manifold .",
    "so there is no cosmological constant , but only an effective cosmological constant @xmath18 induced from the fifth dimension .",
    "mathematically , the three solutions of @xmath21    can be expressed @xcite as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and @xmath18 must satisfy @xmath25 to ensure there are acceptable solutions to ( [ f=0 ] ) .",

    "it is worthy mentioning that the quantum potential labeled by the quantum number @xmath85 is one of the important results in this black string space .",
