    "finding a good turbulence model is a long standing problem . to be useful in applications ,",
    "the model has to be sufficiently simple and yet capable of capturing the basic physical processes such as the energy cascade and the intermittent bursts .",
    "the cascades appear to be a more robust property reasonably well described by classical turbulence closures such as the direct interaction approximation ( dia ) ( @xcite ) and its derivatives ( e.g. edqnm @xcite ) .",
    "the turbulence intermittency appears to be a more subtle process which depends on the detailed features of the dynamical fluid structures .",
    "of particular importance is the question whether the intermittent bursts are caused by finite - time vorticity `` blow - ups '' ( believed to become real singularities in the limit of zero viscosity ) or a `` slower '' exponential vortex stretching by a large - scale strain collectively produced by the surrounding vortex tubes .",
    "note that the first process is local in the scale space , - it is usually viewed as two or more vortex tubes of similar and implosively decreasing radius . on the other hand ,",
    "the second process involves interaction of significantly separated scales , - a thin vortex tube and a large - scale strain .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( @xcite ) indicate that it is the nonlocal scale interactions that are responsible for the deviations of the structure functions from their kolmogorov self - similar value whereas the net effect of the local interactions is to reduce these deviations .",
    "these conclusions lead to a model of turbulence in which a model closure ( e.g. dia ) is used for the local interactions whereas the nonlocal interactions are described by a wavepacket ( wkb ) formalism which exploits the scale separation .",
    "the later describes a linear process of distortion of small - scale turbulence by a strain produced by large scales .",
    "such a linear distortion is a familiar process in engineering applications , for example , when a turbulent fluid flows through a pipe with a sudden change in diameter .",
    "it is described by the rapid distortion theory ( rdt ) introduced by @xcite .",
    "the model considered in this paper is different from the classical rdt in that the distorting strain is stochastic and , therefore , we will call it the stochastic distortion theory ( sdt ) .",
    "we will study a simplest version of sdt in which the large - scale strain is modeled by a gaussian white ( in time ) noise in the spirit of the kraichnan model used for turbulent passive scalars ( @xcite ) and of the kazantsev - kraichnan model from the turbulent dynamo theory ( @xcite ) .    because most of studies so far have focused on the theories with local scale interactions",
    ", we will devote our attention mainly to the description of the nonlocal interactions .",
    "the local interactions are unimportant at small scales in 2d , but they should be taken into account when 3d turbulence is considered . similarly to rdt , the sdt model deals with @xmath0-space quantities due to much greater simplicity of the pressure term in the @xmath0-space .",
    "we will study statistical moments of the @xmath0-space quantities of all orders and not only the second order correlators as it is customary for rdt .",
    "the higher @xmath0-space correlators carry an information about the turbulence statistics and intermittency which is not always available from the two - point coordinate space correlators , the structure functions , which are popular objects in the turbulence theory .",
    "indeed , intermittency in some systems can be dominated by singular @xmath0-space structures which are not singular in the @xmath1-space ( e.g. periodic fields ) .",
    "these structures leave their signature on the scalings of the @xmath0-space moments but not on the @xmath1-space structure functions .",
    "the system considered in the present paper is of this type , and another example of this kind is the magnetic turbulence in the kinematic dynamo problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , sdt bears a lot of similarities to the turbulent dynamo problem and in this paper we will use a method developed in @xcite for its derivation .",
    "we will also see that , like in the dynamo problem , the fourth order @xmath0-space moments allow us to introduce the measures of the mean polarization and of the spectral flatness , - the quantities of special importance for characterization of the small - scale turbulence .",
    "let us consider a velocity field in three - dimensional space that consists of a component @xmath2 with large characteristic scale @xmath3 and a component @xmath4 with small characteristic scale @xmath5 , @xmath6 . in this case ,",
    "navier - stokes equation is @xmath7 let us define the gabor transform ( gt ) ( see @xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a function which decreases rapidly at infinity , e.g. @xmath11 . averaging @xmath12 is performed over the statistics of a random force which will be introduced below .",
    "one can think of the gt as a local fourier transform taken in a box centered at @xmath13 and having a size which is intermediate between @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the gt commutes with the time and space derivatives , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "commutativity with @xmath14 is obvious .",
    "note that the gt commutes with @xmath15 only for distances from the boundaries which are larger than the support of function @xmath16 .",
    "the inverse gt is simply an integration over all wavenumbers , e.g. @xmath17 here , we will study only the nonlocal interaction of small and large scales and therefore we neglect the nonlinear term @xmath18 which corresponds to local interactions among the small scales .",
    "let us apply the gt to the above equation with @xmath19 and only retain terms up to first power in @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( we chose @xmath21 such that @xmath22 ) . all large - scale terms ( the first and the third ones on the lhs and the third one on the rhs ) give no contribution because their gt is exponentially small . equation for the gt of @xmath4 under such assumptions where obtained in @xcite ; it is @xmath23 where @xmath24 equation ( [ ss3 ] ) provides an rdt description of turbulence generalized to the case when both the mean strain and the turbulence are inhomogeneous .",
    "this equation has the form of a wkb - type transport equation with characteristics given by ( [ ray11 ] ) and ( [ ray22 ] ) .",
    "consider this equation for a fluid path determined by @xmath25 , so that @xmath26   because only gabor components will be considered . also , we will not mention explicitly dependence on the fluid path and simply write @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the strain matrix and operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 mean derivatives with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspondingly ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that strain @xmath35 ( taken along a fluid path ) enters this equation as a given function of time .",
    "equation ( [ beqn ] ) is applicable to arbitrary slowly varying in space large - scale flow .",
    "we formulate the sdt model as equation ( [ beqn ] ) complemented by a prescribed statistics of the large - scale flow .",
    "one can use , for example , a numerically computed large - scale strain and use it as an input into the equation ( [ ss3 ] ) should later be integrated numerically . in this paper , however , we would like to derive a reduced model via the statistical averaging which is possible by assuming a sufficiently simple statistics of the large - scale strain . experiments and numerical data indicate that navier - stokes turbulence is gaussian at large scales and we will use this property in our model .",
    "we will further assume that the strain is white in time with @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a matrix the elements of which are statistically independent and white in time , @xmath38 this choice of strain ensure the incompressibility and statistical isotropy .",
    "in this case @xmath39 note that this is not the only way to satisfy the incompressibility and the isotropy and there are infinitely many ways to choose such statistics ; e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite choose @xmath40 however , any such choice will lead to ( up to a time - scale constant ) the same final equations .",
    "the gaussian white in time strain has also been used in the mhd dynamo theory ( kazantsev - kraichnan model : @xcite , @xcite ) and in the theory of turbulent passive scalar ( @xcite ; see also review of @xcite ) .",
    "it is a natural starting point because of its simplicity .",
    "note that for realistic modeling of small - scale turbulence one has to describe a matching to the large - scale range via a low-@xmath0 forcing or a boundary condition . as we will see later",
    ", some properties of the small - scale turbulence turn out to be independent of these effects , e.g. scalings in 2d case , whereas the 3d case is more sensitive to the boundary conditions .",
    "detailed modeling of the low-@xmath0 forcing / boundary conditions is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "below , we will simply consider forcing - free evolution of a finite - support initial condition ( decaying turbulence ) .",
    "we will also consider finite - flux solutions in 2d corresponding to the turbulent cascades in forced turbulence .",
    "let us consider the following set of 1-point correlators of gabor velocities , @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "such correlators where shown in @xcite to be a fundamental set in case of homogeneous isotropic turbulence from which one can express any of two - point correlators of the following kind @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 take values 1 , 2 or 3 indexing the components in 3d space , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are some arbitrary natural numbers . note that homogeneity and isotropy in sdt follow from the coordinate independence and isotropy of the strain and it has to be understood only in a local sense , near the considered fluid particle of the large - scale flow .",
    "now we define a generating function , @xmath49 where overline denotes the complex conjugation .",
    "this function allows one to obtain any of the fundamental 1-point correlators ( [ basis ] ) via differentiation with respect to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52_{\\lambda= \\alpha= \\beta=0 } .",

    "numerical modeling one has to add to it a suitable model for the local scale interactions .",
    "we leave this task for future and concentrate below on studying the effect of the nonlocal interactions only .",
    "let us first of all consider the 2d case .",
    "the large time dynamics of the small - scale turbulence is known to be dominated in 2d by the nonlocal interactions due to generation of intense large - scale vortices and , therefore , the sdt model ( [ zdotff ] ) is relevant even without including a model for the local interactions .",
    "note that equations for the 2d turbulence in which only nonlocal interactions are left are formally identical to the passive scalar equations .",
    "the energy spectra of the nonlocal 2d turbulence and the passive scalars in the batchelor regime were studied in @xcite without making any assumptions on the strain statistics . here",
    "we will study the higher @xmath0-space correlators .",
    "the 2d case is simpler than the 3d one in that all correlators @xmath67 with @xmath68 are not independent and can be expressed in terms of @xmath69 which we will call the energy series , @xmath70_{\\lambda= \\eta=0 } .",

    "we will call invariants @xmath80 and @xmath81 the energy and the enstrophy series correspondingly . the steady state solutions in the range where viscosity is negligible are @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are arbitrary positive constants . for @xmath79 these solutions where obtained in @xcite ; solution ( [ ec1 ] ) corresponds to a constant energy flux ( and equipartition of the enstrophy ) whereas ( [ ec2 ] ) corresponds to an enstrophy cascade ( and equipartition of the energy ) . because the equations for @xmath71 are linear",
    ", any linear combination @xmath86 is also a stationary solution ( in fact the general one ) .",
    "note that the flux of invariant @xmath80 is given by @xmath87 and it is always negative on solutions ( [ ec3 ] ) whereas the flux of @xmath81 , which is @xmath88 , is always positive in the steady state .",
    "thus , in forced turbulence solutions ( [ ec1 ] ) will form on the low-@xmath0 side of the forcing scale and solutions ( [ ec2 ] ) on the high-@xmath0 side of it , which agrees with the general observation that the energy cascade is inverse and the enstrophy cascade is a direct one .",
    "let us introduce a spectral flatness , @xmath89 for gaussian fields , @xmath90 would be independent of @xmath0 and , therefore , @xmath0-dependence of @xmath90 bears an information about the scale invariance and presence of turbulence intermittency .",
    "in particular , for the solutions ( [ ec1 ] ) we have @xmath91 indicating that the inverse cascades are not intermittent : turbulence produced by a gaussian forcing at some scale @xmath92 will remain gaussian at @xmath93 . on solutions ( [ ec2 ] )",
    "we have @xmath94 which indicates broken scale invariance and growing deviation from gaussianity at small scales .",
    "such a small - scale intermittency in the direct cascades is due to nearly singular @xmath0-structures having the shape of strongly elongated ellipses in 2d @xmath0-space which are centered at the origin .",
    "each strain realization will produce just one of these ( randomly oriented ) ellipses out of an initial circular ( isotropic ) distribution .",
    "3d navier - stokes turbulence is never likely to be nonlocal and for its realistic description one should add a model of the local interactions into the rhs of equation ( [ zdotff ] ) .",

    "thus , we see that @xmath125 contains information not only about the amplitudes but also about the phases of the fourier modes",
    ". in particular , @xmath131 corresponds to the case where all fourier components of the magnetic field have plane polarization .",

    "this is the case for example for gaussian fields when @xmath133 . on the other hand , smallness of the phase differences",
    "can be overpowered in @xmath125 by large amplitudes .",
    "therefore , a better measure of the mean polarization would be a normalized @xmath125 , e.g. , @xmath134 defined this way the mean turbulence polarization is an example of an important physical quantity which can be obtained from the one - point fourier correlators and is unavailable from the coordinate space ( one - point or two - point ) correlators .",
    "equation ( [ weqn ] ) can be solved similarly to the energy spectrum equation ( [ eeqn ] ) , namely by transforming it into equation ( [ phidot ] ) by a substitution similar to ( [ univ ] ) and then using the solution ( [ phidis ] ) . in the inviscid regime ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 )",
    "we have @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a constant which can be found from the initial conditions .",
    "we see that @xmath125 develops a @xmath137 scaling range which is cut off at low and high @xmath0 by exponentially propagating fronts . within this scaling range",
    ", @xmath125 decays exponentially in time .    given @xmath125",
    ", one can find @xmath138 by using substitution @xmath139 which leads to a closed equation for @xmath140 which can be solved similarly to @xmath141 and @xmath125 .",
    "this gives for the inviscid regime @xmath142 where @xmath143 is another constant which can be found from the initial conditions .",
    "for @xmath144 , the second term in the parenthesis should be neglected .",
    "then , we have the following solution for the mean turbulence polarization , @xmath145 as we see , in the inviscid regime the mean polarization tends to an independent of @xmath0 value which exponentially decays in time .",
    "this means that all turbulence wavepackets eventually become plane polarized .",
    "recall that such turbulence is very far from being gaussian for which the mean polarization remains finite ( elliptic and circular polarized modes are present ) .",
    "in the diffusive regime , @xmath113 , we have @xmath146 and @xmath147 thus , @xmath148 is still give by the same formula ( [ psoln ] ) indicating that the mean polarization continues to further decrease in time with the same exponential rate .",
    "thus , by the time the diffusive regime is achieved @xmath125 can be essentially put equal to zero .    the fact that the polarization becomes plane has quite simple physical explanation .",
    "indeed , a vorticity wavepacket of arbitrary polarization will be strongly distorted by the stretching which mostly occurs along the dominant eigenvector of the lagrangian deformation matrix ( corresponding to the greatest lyapunov exponent ) .",
    "such a stretching make any initial `` spiral '' flat for large time with the dominant field component lying in the plane passing through the stretching and the wavevector directions ( and , of course , @xmath149 is perpendicular to @xmath150 ) .",
    "another important measure of turbulence intermittency available from the @xmath0-space moments is the spectral flatness which can be defined as @xmath151 . for large time in the inviscid regime @xmath152",
    "we see that the flatness growths both in time and in @xmath0 which indicates presence of the small - scale intermittency .",
    "such an intermittency can be attributed to the presence of coherent structures in @xmath0-space .",
    "one can also find solution for the fourth order correlator @xmath138 in the dissipative regime .",
    "this will be done in the next section together with correlators of all higher orders .",
    "the observation in the end of the previous section ( that there is a dominant field component ) allows us to predict that for large time @xmath153 in each realization so that @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , property @xmath155 , if valid initially , should be preserved by the equation for @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , by using the equation ( [ zdotfff ] ) combination @xmath156 satisfies a closed homogeneous equation .",
    "this means that if @xmath157 at @xmath158 then it will remain identically zero for any time .",
    "thus , we can consider a class of solutions of ( [ zdotff ] ) ( corresponding to large - time asymptotics of the general solution ) such that @xmath155 .",

    "we have @xmath166 and in the diffusive regime ( @xmath113 ) @xmath167 this expression agrees with the results obtained in the previous sections for @xmath79 and @xmath168 .",
    "we see that the main effect of the dissipation is the prefactor change @xmath169 and the @xmath170 form - factor which corresponds to a log - correction at @xmath171 and an exponential cut - off at @xmath172 .",
    "similar results were obtained for the magnetic field moments in @xcite . in that case",
    "it is the exponential cut - off that causes the change of the exponential growth in the mean magnetic energy ( @xcite , @xcite ) and in the higher @xmath1-space moments of the magnetic field ( @xcite ) .    the scalings in ( [ psi_n_pc ] ) and ( [ psi_n_diff ] ) with respect to the order @xmath47 contain important information about the small - scale turbulence .",
    "in particular the exponential growth in time with exponent @xmath173 indicates that the turbulence statistics is log - normal . an equivalent result for the magnetic fields in the kinematic dynamo problem",
    "was obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the log - normality arises because the strain is a multiplicative noise for the velocity field which becomes nearly one - dimensional and because the time integrated strain tends to become a gaussian process .",
    "formally , this result can be also obtained using the random matrix theory of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and a more detailed physical explanation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the fourier correlators is also very important because it gives an information about the dominant structures in the wavenumber space .",
    "suppose that initially the turbulence is isotropic and concentrated in a ball centered at the origin in the wavenumber space .",
    "for each realization such a ball will stretch into an ellipsoid with one large , one short and one neutral dimensions .",
    "one can visualize this ellipsoid as an elongated flat cactus leaf with thorns showing the velocity field direction .",
    "note that in this picture one component of the velocity field ( transverse to the cactus leaf ) is dominant which is captured by the fact that the polarization @xmath125 introduced in this paper tends to zero at large time .",
    "another consequence of this picture is that the wavenumber space will be covered by the ellipsoids more sparsely at large @xmath0 which implies large intermittent fluctuations of the velocity field in the @xmath0-space .",
    "these fluctuations could be quantified by the flatness @xmath174 which was shown in ( [ fsoln ] ) to grow as @xmath175 , a clear indication of the small - scale intermittency .",
    "in the previous sections , the sdt model was formulated and studied assuming that the large - scale strain is a gaussian white noise process .",
    "this assumption , similar to the kazantsev - kraichnan dynamo model , allowed us to obtain some important analytical solutions for the energy spectrum , the polarization , the flatness and higher - order correlators which capture the turbulence intermittency . in real experimental and in numerical turbulence",
    "the strain is generally far from being a gaussian white noise .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study sensitivity of our sdt model and its predictions to the strain statistics .    in this section",
    ", we will numerically simulate ( [ beqn ] ) for two different types of strain .",
    "first , we consider a synthetic gaussian strain field with a finite correlation time @xmath176 which is algorithmically generated as @xmath177 where @xmath37 is the same matrix as in ( [ aij ] ) and @xmath178 is the time step . the r.m.s . of the different strain components in this numerical experiment ranged from 2.9 to 3.6 and",
    "the correlation time was 0.02 .",
    "thus , the correlation time was about 16 times less than the characteristic strain distortion time .",
    "we considered 512 strain realizations of the synthetic field .    in the second numerical experiment ,",
    "the strain matrix components were obtained from a @xmath179 spectral dns of the navier - stokes equations at reynolds number @xmath180 .",
    "the strain time series were recorded along 512 fluid paths . the r.m.s . of the different strain components in this case ranged from 6.6 to 9.3 and",
    "the correlation time was approximately 0.08 .",
    "thus , the correlation time in this case is of the same order as the inverse strain rate which is natural for the real navier - stokes turbulence where both values are of order of the eddy turnover time at the kolmogorov scale .    because of the fairly short correlation time and because of the gaussianity , the first numerical experiment is closer to the gaussian white - noise analytical model than the second experiment where the strain is not gaussian and has long time correlations . in a sense , comparison of results of the first experiment and the analytical solutions may be considered a performance test of the numerical method . on the other hand , comparison between the results of the first and the second experiments allows us to establish their sensitivity to the strain statistics .",
    "to compute ( [ beqn ] ) we used a second order in time runge - kutta scheme with a time step of 20 times less than the correlation time for the synthetic case . for the simulation with strain from dns ,",
    "a time step identical to the dns have been used ( i.e. 200 times less than the correlation time of strain ) in both numerical experiments , for each strain realization we consider a distribution of wavepackets ( 2048 in the synthetic case and 8192 for the dns ) with initial @xmath150 chosen randomly in a sphere of radius @xmath181 . for each wavenumber @xmath150 ,",
    "the two fourier components of the velocity @xmath182 and @xmath183 are chosen randomly such that @xmath184 where @xmath185 , @xmath186 are uniform random numbers in the interval @xmath187 $ ] and @xmath188 is a constant ( function of the total number of particles ) .",
    "the last component @xmath189 is deduced from @xmath190 to respect the incompressibility . however , the minimum value of @xmath191 is limited by the condition that when calculated @xmath189 appears to be excessively large such wavepacket is discarded . the viscosity @xmath192 was set to @xmath193 in both numerical experiments",
    ".         dns ]    figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show the energy spectrum at several different moments of time in the first and the second numerical experiment correspondingly . in both cases",
    "one can see an excellent agreement with the theoretical -2.5 slope for time less than @xmath194 which is about 4.5 and 0.7 for the first and the second experiments respectively . at @xmath195 ,",
    "turbulence reaches the dissipative scale and the spectrum accepts a log - corrected shape .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the time growth of the total energy and the energy spectrum at several fixed wavenumbers in the first and the second numerical experiment respectively .",
    "one can see that the growth is approximately exponential as predicted by the theory .",
    "it is interesting that the theory also predicts a change to a slower exponential growth of the total energy when time crosses @xmath194 .",
    "similar effect is called the dissipative anomaly in the kinematic dynamo theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is consistent with figure [ fig3 ] which shows that at @xmath196 the slope for the total energy gets smaller and becomes approximately equal to the slope of the individual @xmath0-components ( as predicted by the theory ) . for the second experiment",
    "the growth is also approximately exponential and the change of slope occurs at @xmath197 .",
    "( dashed lines ) in the case of the synthetic gaussian strain with a finite correlation time ]     ( dashed lines ) in the case of the strain obtained from 512@xmath198 dns ]    figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show the spectrum of the polarization at several fixed wavenumbers in the first and the second numerical experiment respectively . similarly to the white - noise strain , in both simulations the polarization sharply decreases in time and it tends to an independent of @xmath0 spectrum in the inertial range ( with a log - correction for @xmath199 ) .",
    "dns ]    figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] show the spectrum of the flatness at several fixed wavenumbers in the first and the second numerical experiment respectively .",
    "similarly to the white - noise predictions , the flatness is growing with time .",
    "however , the theoretical 3/2 slope is observed neither for the synthetic nor for the dns strain case .",
    "the fact that these deviations are observed in the same way for both the dns strain and the synthetic strain ( which is short correlated and therefore quite close to the white noise process ) might indicate a failure of the numerical method to reproduce some features of higher correlators rather than a true deviation due to the differences in the strain statistics .",
    "further discrepancy arises for the dns strain case at very large time when the flatness is observed to decrease .",
    "in this paper we introduced a description of the small - scale navier - stokes turbulence with much larger scales , the sdt model .",
    "such nonlocal interactions dominate in 2d turbulence at large time . in 3d",
    ", they were shown to be responsible for intermittency in numerical experiments ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sdt model assumes that the large scales are gaussian and short correlated in time and it describes turbulence in terms of the one - point @xmath0-space correlators using the method introduced in @xcite for the kinematic dynamo problem .",
    "we studied both 2d and 3d turbulence , the 2d case being equivalent to the problem of 2d passive scalars in the batchelor regime . in 2d , we found steady state solutions for correlators of all orders .",
    "these solutions correspond to forced turbulence and they describe cascades of the energy and enstrophy series of invariants ( two invariants at each order ) .",
    "the energy cascades are non - intermittent : initially gaussian turbulence at the forcing scale remains gaussian and scale invariant throughout the inertial range . on the contrary ,",
    "the scale invariance and gaussianity break down for the enstrophy cascades and a regime dominated by thin elliptical structures develops in the @xmath0-space . in 3d",
    ", we found that the steady state does not exist in sdt and the total energy grows in a dynamo - like fashion . to have a realistic description of the steady state of the navier - stokes turbulence one have to compliment sdt with a model for the local scale interaction which will be done in future work .",
    "however , the study of the purely nonlocal interaction presented in this paper reveals several interesting effects which are likely to persist in some form when the local interactions are taken into account .",
    "in particular , the nonlocal interactions are shown to lead to an interesting turbulent state in which all modes have plane polarization in the @xmath0-space .",
    "statistics of such turbulent fields is far from being gaussian ( in which all polarizations are present ) .",
    "similar effect for the dynamo magnetic fields was found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-space moments allow also to quantify the dominant coherent structures in the @xmath0-space which are responsible for intermittency in similar way as the @xmath1-space moments capture the @xmath0-space structures .",
    "note that singular structures in the @xmath0-space are not necessarily singular in the @xmath1-space ( e.g. a field periodic in some direction is a singular 1d line in the @xmath0-space ) .",
    "for the navier - stokes turbulence , the intermittent @xmath0-space structures are found to be very elongated ellipsoids centered at the origin .",
    "these structures leave their signatures on the spectral flatness and on the scalings of the higher @xmath0-space moments with respect to the order @xmath47 .",
    "further , similarly to the kinematic dynamo problem the scalings indicate presence of the log - normal statistics of the small - scale velocity fields . naturally , putting back the local interactions into the model will weaken the tendency to form elongated ellipsoids and plane polarized wavepackets , but some deviation from the gaussian statistics in the direction predicted by these tendencies should be expected in real navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "we studied numerically the sdt model ( [ beqn ] ) for a synthetic gaussian strain with a finite correlation time and for a strain field obtained from a 512@xmath198 spectral dns of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the results show that most predictions of the white - noise theory , such as e.g. the energy spectrum shape , the polarization decrease and the increase of the spectral flatness , are also observed in these two cases of the strain .",
    "thus , the sdt equations obtained for the gaussian white noise strain are likely to be a good model for the nonlocal interactions in real navier - stokes turbulence .",
    "our aim here is to derive a closed equation for the generating function @xmath53 starting with equation ( [ zdot ] ) .",
    "the last term in this equation is the easiest one , @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a differential operator defined in ( [ cald ] ) .",
    "the correlators containing factor @xmath202 can be found using the gaussian integration by parts . in particular",
    "@xmath203 , \\label{g_int}\\ ] ] where we have used the definition ( [ e ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath204 is a response function , @xmath205 differentiating ( [ beqn ] ) with respect to @xmath35 and using whiteness of the strain tensor we get @xmath206 in what follows we will use the turbulence isotropy , in particular , expressions of type @xmath207 substituting ( [ gam1 ] ) into ( [ g_int ] ) and using the above isotropy relations we have @xmath208 where @xmath201 is a differential operator defined in ( [ cald ] ) .",
