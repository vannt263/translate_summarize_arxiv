    "in this paper , we consider the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a complex - valued function on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the nonlinearity .",
    "our goal is to construct _",
    "mixed dimensional infinite soliton trains _ ( mixed trains ) , which are solutions of whose asymptotic profiles at time infinity consist of infinitely many solitons of multiple dimensions",
    ".    the nonlinear schrdinger equation appears in various physical contexts , for example in nonlinear optics or in the modelling of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "mathematically speaking , it is one of the model nonlinear dispersive pde , along with the korteweg - de vries equation and the nonlinear wave equation .",
    "its local cauchy theory in the energy space @xmath6 is well understood ( see e.g. @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "its long time dynamics has two competing effects : first of all , if the nonlinearity is not too strong , the linear part of the equation can dominate and solutions may behave as if they were solutions to the free linear schrdinger equation .",
    "this is the _ scattering effect_. on the other hand , in some cases the nonlinear term dominates and the solution tends to concentrate , with possible blow - up in finite time .",
    "this is the _ focusing effect_. at the equilibrium between these two effects , one may encounter many different types of structures that neither scatter nor focus .",
    "the most common of these non - scattering global structures are the solitons , but there exist also dark solitons , kinks , etc .",
    "a generic conjecture for nonlinear dispersive pde is the _ soliton resolution conjecture_. roughly speaking , it says that , as can be observed in physical settings , any global solution will eventually decompose at large time into a scattering part and well separated non - scattering structures , usually a sum of solitons .",
    "apart from integrable cases ( see e.g. @xcite ) , such conjecture is usually out of reach .",
    "intermediate steps toward this conjecture are existence and stability results of configurations with well separated non - scattering structure , like multi - solitons , multi - kinks , infinite soliton and kink - soliton trains , etc",
    ". see @xcite for a survey on these subjects . in what follows",
    "we describe results most relevant to us .",
    "multi - solitons are solutions of with the asymptotic profile @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and each @xmath10 is a soliton to be specified in .",
    "the first result of existence of multi - solitons was obtained in zakharov and shabat @xcite in the case of the @xmath11-d focusing cubic ( i.e. @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) nonlinear schrdinger equation via the inverse scattering method .",
    "indeed , in this particular case the equation is completely integrable and one can obtain multi - solitons in a rather explicit manner .",
    "kamvissis @xcite showed that it is possible to push the inverse scattering analysis forward and obtain the existence of an _ infinite soliton train _ ,",
    "i.e. a solution @xmath14 of defined as in but with @xmath15 . in fact , it is shown that , under some technical hypotheses , any solution to with initial data in the schwartz class will eventually decompose at large time as an infinite soliton train and a `` background radiation component '' .",
    "there are also results for multi - dark solitons for the companion integrable gross - pitaevskii case , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath16 , but no known results for infinite trains .    in a non - integrable",
    "setting , the first existence result of multi - solitons was obtained by merle in @xcite as a by - product of the proof of existence of multiple blow - up points solutions for @xmath17-critical , i.e. @xmath18 . the techniques initiated in @xcite were then developed in @xcite for other nonlinearities .",
    "the idea , so called the energy method , is to choose an increasing sequence of time @xmath19 with @xmath20 and consider the solutions @xmath21 to which solve the equation backward in time with final data @xmath22 .",
    "the sequence @xmath21 is an approximate sequence for a multi - soliton . to show its convergence , two arguments are at play .",
    "first , one shows that there exists a time @xmath23 independent of @xmath24 such that @xmath25 satisfies on @xmath26 $ ] the uniform estimates @xmath27 second , we have compactness of the sequence of initial data @xmath28 , i.e. there exists @xmath29 so that @xmath30 in @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",
    "see also @xcite for stability results under restrictive hypotheses .",
    "the energy method is very flexible and can be adapted to other situations . however , its implementation is far from being trivial when the number of solitons is infinite or when one soliton is replaced by a kink . in le coz , li and tsai @xcite ,",
    "an approach based on fixed point argument has been used to construct such structures . in this approach",
    ", the large relative speed has been used to get smallness of the duhamel term due to short interaction time .",
    "it is however delicate when the gradient of the error term is also measured .",
    "we will explain this approach in more details below , as we will use it to construct mixed dimensional infinite soliton trains .",

    ", the above decomposition of the source term into @xmath70 and @xmath71 will be convenient .",
    "apparently , the control of @xmath70 will come from our assumed control on @xmath65 . on the other hand ,",

    "we remark that the term `` train '' is only used in a suggestive sense .",
    "it well describes the one dimensional situation where all solitons travel in the same direction . in higher dimensions",

    "what the `` suitable conditions '' are will be clear in due course .",
    "roughly speaking , they concern the speeds of the following two limits : i ) @xmath98 , so that the lebesgue norms of @xmath99 ( or also of @xmath100 ) can be controlled by ; ii ) @xmath101 ( as @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) , so that different solitons are sufficiently separated to each other .",
    "[ rem : ini ] we assume the initial positions of all the solitons to be the origin for simplicity .",
    "this is an apparent reason why some constructions ( such as the second result cited above ) have to be done on time intervals @xmath104 with positive @xmath23 .",
    "the same situation will occur in some of our results for mixed dimensional trains .",
    "now we consider asymptotic profiles consisting of solitons of multiple dimensions .",
    "the simplest example is @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are solitons in @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively . for convenience ,",
    "we ll call them 1d solitons and 2d solitons .",
    "can be visualized as the profile of a line - point soliton train in @xmath109 ( and a plane - line soliton train in @xmath110 , a space - plane soliton train in @xmath111 , and so on ) .",
    "similarly , we can consider a combination of @xmath112d solitons and @xmath49d solitons for @xmath113 , or even combinations involving three or more dimensions .",
    "( it turns out that there are limited realizable combinations .",
    "see the section `` main results '' below . )",
    "solutions having such kind of profiles will be called _ mixed ( dimensional ) trains_. in the following we take as an example to describe the particular difficulties in constructing mixed trains .",
    "first , our general idea encounters a problem if we only use a 2d error @xmath114 . to see this , note that by posing a solution of the form @xmath115 , we get @xmath116 then , with @xmath117 being fixed , we have @xmath118 which is nonzero in general . that is @xmath71 has no space decay at infinity , and hence defies any suitable estimate",
    "( we will need @xmath119 controls of @xmath71 for @xmath120 ) .",
    "to resolve this problem , we will also introduce a lower dimensional error .",
    "precisely , we will construct a solution of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 is such that @xmath123 is an 1d train ( i.e. a solution of ) . in this way , by regarding @xmath75 as the sequence defined by @xmath124 , and @xmath125 for @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 which we will be able to estimate suitably .",
    "the main difficulty in the construction is that the 1d objects @xmath106 and @xmath128 only allow @xmath129 bounds in @xmath130 .",
    "there are two aspects of the effect of this restriction .",
    "\\1 ) to estimate products involving 1d objects and @xmath65 ( such as @xmath131 ) , we must have @xmath132 estimates of the 1d objects , to avoid the need of dealing with `` anisotropic '' estimates of @xmath65 . here by an _",
    "anisotropic estimate _ we mean an @xmath133 estimate with @xmath134 .",
    "whether such estimates are available for @xmath65 is unclear ( see appendix [ appii ] ) .",
    "now , for @xmath106 , the @xmath132 estimate is easy to obtain from .",
    "however , there is no ready result asserting an @xmath132 control of @xmath128 .",
    "in the previous works @xcite , the authors did not concern the possibility of constructing ( single dimensional ) trains with @xmath135 control of the errors .",
    "( nevertheless , does imply such controls by sobolev embedding .",
