    "wireless communication using visible light wavelengths ( 400 to 700 nm ) in indoor local area network environments is emerging as a promising area of research @xcite .",
    "visible light communication ( vlc ) is evolving as an appealing complementary technology to radio frequency ( rf ) communication technology @xcite . in vlc ,",
    "simple and inexpensive light emitting diodes ( led ) and photo diodes ( pd ) act as signal transmitters and receptors , respectively , replacing more complex and expensive transmit / receive rf hardware and antennas in rf wireless communication systems . other favorable features in vlc include availability of abundant visible light spectrum at no cost , no licensing / rf radiation issues , and inherent security in closed - room applications .",
    "the possibility of using the same leds to simultaneously provide both energy - efficient lighting as well as high - speed short - range communication is another attractive feature .",
    "the potential to use multiple leds and pds in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) array configurations has enthused mimo wireless researchers to take special interest in vlc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "signaling schemes considered in multiple - led vlc include space shift keying ( ssk ) and its generalization ( gssk ) , where the on / off status of the leds and the indices of the leds which are on convey information bits @xcite,@xcite . other multiple - led signaling schemes considered in the literature include spatial multiplexing ( smp ) , spatial modulation ( sm ) , and generalized spatial modulation ( gsm ) @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these works have considered real signal sets like @xmath0-ary pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) with positive - valued signal points in line with the need for the transmit signal in vlc to be positive and real - valued to intensity modulate the leds .    the vlc channel between an led and a photo detector in indoor environments can be a multipath channel .",
    "the multipath effects can be mitigated by using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) .",
    "the use of complex signal sets like @xmath0-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) along with ofdm in vlc is studied extensively in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "techniques reported in these works include dc - biased optical ( dco ) ofdm @xcite , asymmetrically clipped optical ( aco ) ofdm @xcite-@xcite , flip ofdm @xcite,@xcite , non - dc biased ( ndc ) ofdm @xcite , and index modulation for ndc ofdm @xcite .",
    "a key constraint in the above techniques , however , is that they perform hermitian symmetry operation on the qam symbol vector at the ifft input so that the ifft output would be positive and real - valued .",
    "a consequence of this is that @xmath1 channel uses are needed to send @xmath2 symbols .    in this paper , we propose two simple and novel complex modulation techniques for vlc using multiple leds , which do not need hermitian symmetry operation .",
    "the proposed schemes exploit the spatial dimension to convey complex - valued modulation symbols .",
    "* the first proposed idea is to use four leds to form a single modulation unit that simultaneously conveys the real and imaginary parts of a complex modulation symbol and their sign information .",
    "while the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts are conveyed through intensity modulation ( i m ) of leds , the sign information is conveyed through spatial indexing of leds . since four leds",
    "form one complex modulation unit , we term this as _ quad - led complex modulation ( qcm ) _ @xcite . * the second idea is to exploit the representation of a complex symbol in polar coordinates . instead of conveying the real and imaginary parts of a complex symbol and their sign information using four leds in qcm , we can convey only the magnitude and phase of a complex symbol .",
    "we need only two leds for this purpose and there is no sign information to convey in this representation .",
    "so we use only two leds to form a single modulation unit in this case .",
    "we term this scheme as _ dual - led complex modulation ( dcm ) _ since two leds constitute one complex modulator . *",
    "the third proposed idea is to bring in the advantages of spatial modulation to the dcm scheme . instead of using all the four leds to transmit one complex symbol ( as in qcm )",
    ", we choose two out of four leds to transmit the magnitude and phase of a complex symbol as in dcm scheme . since we have to choose one pair of leds ( one block ) out of two and each pair will perform the same operation as in dcm scheme , we term this scheme as _ spatial modulation - dcm ( sm - dcm ) _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we investigate the bit error performance of the proposed qcm , dcm , and sm - dcm schemes through analysis and simulations .",
    "we obtain upper bounds on the bit error rate ( ber ) of qcm , dcm , and sm - dcm .",
    "these analytical bounds are very tight at high signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) .",
    "therefore , these bounds enable us to easily compute and plot the achievable rate contours for a desired a target ber ( e.g. , @xmath3 ber ) in qcm , dcm , and sm - dcm .",
    "the analytical and simulation results show that the qcm , dcm , sm - dcm schemes achieve good ber performance .",
    "dcm has the advantage of fewer leds ( 2 leds ) per complex modulator and better performance compared to qcm for small - sized modulation alphabets ( e.g. , 8-qam ) . on the other hand",
    ", qcm has the advantage of additional degrees of freedom ( 4 leds ) compared to dcm , because of which it achieves better performance compared to dcm for large alphabet sizes ( e.g. , 16-qam , 32-qam , 64-qam ) .",
    "sm - dcm achieves better performance compared to dcm and qcm for small - sized modulation alphabets ( e.g. , 16-qam ) since it requires smaller modulation size . on the other hand , for large alphabet sizes",
    ", sm - dcm performs better compared to qcm at low @xmath4 values due to lower order modulation size , whereas at high @xmath4 values , sm - dcm performance degrades because of the reduced average relative distance between transmit vectors compared to qcm .",
    "since qcm and dcm can directly handle complex symbols in vlc , techniques which are applied to complex modulation schemes to improve performance in rf wireless channels can be applied to vlc as well .",
    "for example , it is known that rotation of complex modulation symbols can improve ber performance in rf wireless communication @xcite . motivated by this observation",
    ", we explore the possibility of achieving performance improvement in vlc through phase rotation of complex modulation symbols prior to mapping the signals to the leds in qcm .",
    "we term this scheme as qcm with phase rotation ( qcm - pr ) .",
    "results show that phase rotation of modulation symbols indeed can improve the ber performance of qcm in vlc .",
    "we also study the proposed qcm and dcm schemes when used along with ofdm ; we refer to these schemes as qcm - ofdm and dcm - ofdm",
    ". we present zero - forcing and minimum distance detectors and their performance for qcm - ofdm and dcm - ofdm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in a given channel use , each led is either off or emits light with some intensity which is the magnitude of either the real part or imaginary part of a complex modulation symbol .",

    "as in @xcite , we consider only the line - of - sight ( los ) paths between the leds and the photo detectors . from @xcite , the los channel gain @xmath14",
    "is calculated as ( see fig .",

    "the leds and the photo detectors are placed in a room of size 5m@xmath305m@xmath303.5 m as shown in fig .",
    "the leds are placed at a height of 0.5 m below the ceiling and the photo detectors are placed on a table of height 0.8 m .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the distance between the leds and @xmath32 denote the distance between the photo detectors .",
    "assuming perfect synchronization , the @xmath33 received signal vector at the receiver is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the responsivity of the detector @xcite and @xmath36 is the noise vector of dimension @xmath33 .",
    "each element in the noise vector @xmath36 is the sum of received thermal noise and ambient shot light noise , which can be modeled as i.i.d .",

    "the proposed qcm scheme uses four leds at the transmitter .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the block diagram of a qcm transmitter .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the complex modulation alphabet used ( e.g. , qam ) . in each channel use , one complex symbol from @xmath41 ( chosen based on @xmath42 information bits )",
    "is signaled by the four leds as described below .",
    "each complex modulation symbol can have a positive or negative real part , and a positive or negative imaginary part .",
    "for example , the signal set for 16-qam is @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the complex symbol to be signaled in a given channel use .",
    "let @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "two leds ( say , led1 and led2 ) are used to convey the magnitude and sign of @xmath46 as follows .",
    "led1 will emit with intensity @xmath49 if @xmath46 is positive @xmath50 , whereas led2 will emit with the same intensity @xmath49 if @xmath46 is negative @xmath51 .",
    "note that , since @xmath46 is either @xmath52 or @xmath53 , only any one of led1 and led2 will be on in a given channel use and the other will be off . in a similar way , the remaining two leds ( i.e. , led3 and led4 ) will convey the magnitude and sign of @xmath47 in such a way that led3 will emit intensity @xmath54 if @xmath47 is @xmath52 , whereas led4 will emit with the same intensity @xmath54 if @xmath47 is @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , qcm sends one complex symbol in one channel use .",
    "the mapping of the magnitudes and signs of @xmath46 and @xmath47 to the activity of leds in a given channel use is summarized in table [ tab ] .",

    "[ cols=\"^,<,^ , < \" , ]     we consider a target ber of @xmath3 .",

    ", the upper bounds and simulation results almost match for bers below @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , these bounds can be used to accurately map the spatial distribution of the snrs to achievable rate contours for the considered target ber of @xmath3 .",
    "this is done as follows . using the average received snr at a given spatial position of the receiver and the ber vs snr relation given by the ber upper bound expression , determine the maximum qam size ( among 2- , 4- , 8- , 16- , 32- , 64-qam ) that meets the @xmath3 ber target .",
    "this determination is made for all spatial positions of the receiver at a spatial resolution of 2.5 cm .",
    "the resulting spatial map of the maximum qam size possible gives the achievable rate in bpcu at various spatial positions of the receiver .",
    "_ results and discussions : _ we computed the spatial performance measures discussed above for qcm , dcm , and sm - dcm with @xmath56 m and @xmath57 . figures [ fig_a](a),(b ) , and ( c ) show these performance plots for qcm , dcm , and sm - dcm , respectively .",
    "it can be observed that the maximum rate achieved by qcm and sm - dcm while meeting the @xmath3 ber target is 5 bpcu ( i.e. , maximum supported qam size is 32-qam and 16-qam for qcm and sm - dcm , respectively ) and the maximum rate achieved by dcm is 4 bpcu ( i.e. , maximum supported qam size is 16-qam ) .",
    "this is due to the observation we made in fig .",
    "[ dcmber1 ] and [ fig20 ] , where we saw that qcm had a larger average relative distance between the transmit vectors compared to dcm and sm - dcm for large qam sizes and this resulted in a favorable performance for qcm over dcm and sm - dcm .",
    "this is found to result in qcm achieving a larger percentage area of the room covered by 4 bpcu ( covering 70% area ) and 5 bpcu ( covering 45% area ) rates than dcm .",
    "similarly , qcm achieves a larger percentage area of the room covered by 5 bpcu ( covering 70% area ) than sm - dcm .",
    "dcm shows a performance advantage over qcm for 8-qam ; this can be seen by observing that dcm supports 8-qam in more than 90% of the room while qcm covers a lesser area for 8-qam .",
    "similarly , sm - dcm shows a performance advantage over qcm and dcm for @xmath58 bpcu and @xmath59 bpcu , respectively .",
    "this can be seen by observing that sm - dcm covers more than 90% of the room while qcm and dcm covers a lesser area for @xmath58 bpcu and @xmath59 bpcu , respectively .",
    "we proposed three simple and novel complex modulation schemes that avoided the hermitian symmetry operation to generate led compatible positive real signals encountered in vlc .",
