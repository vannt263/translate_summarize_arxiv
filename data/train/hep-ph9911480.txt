    "the descriptions of the total cross sections for elastic hadron - hadron , photon - hadron , and lepton - hadron scattering at large energy have been important issues in the understanding of qcd . only a limited type of hadron reactions , the so - called hard processes , could be understood within the perturbative qcd .",
    "most of the available data , however , deals with processes where the momentum transfer between the quarks and the gluons is relatively small and therefore their understanding should be the subject of nonperturbative studies .",
    "the latter are performed by the use of effective theories based on qcd .",
    "regge theory is a well - known nonperturbative approach to hadron reactions @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that at large energy multi - particle exchanges with definite quantum numbers can be expressed by one effective particle exchange with its propagator given by the so - called regge trajectory @xmath6 .",
    "it was shown that one can fix the shape of the usual regge trajectory @xmath7 from the analysis of the mass spectrum @xmath8 of the hadronic states with spin @xmath9 , where @xmath10 lies on this trajectory .",
    "most regge trajectories have the same slope @xmath11 gev@xmath12 , which can be related with the universal value of the string tension between quarks , as has been found in lattice qcd calculations",
    ". the intercepts of the usual secondary regge trajectories are not very large : @xmath13 .",
    "the pomeron trajectory , which was introduced into particle physics more than forty years ago , has properties which are very different from those of the other trajectories : it has the intercept larger than one , @xmath14 , and a slope @xmath15 gev@xmath12 .",
    "these peculiar properties of the pomeron play an important role in particle reactions , e.g. , the pomeron - exchange not only gives the main contribution to the total hadronic cross sections but also determines the behavior of the elastic differential cross sections at large energy and small momentum transfer .",
    "the origin of the pomeron - exchange has not yet been understood from qcd , but general wisdom ascribes its existence to the the _ conformal anomaly _ of the theory .",
    "this anomaly leads to finite hadron masses due to the non - vanishing of the matrix elements @xmath16 and vacuum energy density .",
    "the landshoff - nachtmann model @xcite directly relates the properties of the soft pomeron with the non - zero value of gluon condensate @xmath17 and the nonperturbative two - gluon exchange between hadrons .",
    "in addition to the conformal anomaly , qcd has also a non - conserved flavor singlet axial vector current due to the _ axial anomaly_. this anomaly has played a crucial role in understanding the pseudoscalar meson spectrum .",
    "however only recently it has been clarified its importance for understanding the dis spin - dependent structure functions . a solution to the proton spin problem ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) due to the non - vanishing of the matrix element @xmath18 has been suggested , where @xmath19 is the dual to the gluon tensor @xmath20 . within supersymmetric qcd",
    "only some definite chiral combinations of these two tensors , @xmath21 , correspond to superfields @xcite .",
    "therefore the matrix elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be related to each other .",
    "this link was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the value of the flavor singlet axial vector charge of the proton .",
    "does this relation hold also in real qcd ? , and if so , what are its implications in regge phenomenology ?",
    "if this relation holds , it would be natural that , _",
    "in addition to _ the pomeron trajectory , a new anomalous regge trajectory would exist , associated to the vacuum properties of qcd through the axial anomaly and therefore with its quantum numbers .",
    "our aim here is to show through data analysis that this possibility is indeed realized .",
    "we will estimate the contribution of this trajectory to the elastic proton - proton scattering cross section and show it to be very important .",
    "we also compute the contribution of this trajectory to the photoproduction of the @xmath24 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "moreover we show that due to the specific quantum numbers of the possible exchanges , polarized and unpolarized proton - proton scattering and photoproduction of vector mesons can be very useful for investigating the possible consequences of this new trajectory .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the connection of the properties of the @xmath25 meson with axial anomaly is discussed .",
    "the effect of the new trajectory in proton - proton elastic scattering is evaluated in sec .",
    "section  iv is devoted to the contribution of the @xmath25-exchange to the cross sections in @xmath24 and @xmath3 meson photoproduction . in sec .",
    "v the contribution of the new trajectory to the polarization observables in @xmath26 collision and vector - meson photoproduction is obtained and its nontrivial role in polarized particle reactions is discussed .",
    "we give a short summary and some conclusions in sec .",
    "the small value of the flavor singlet axial vector charge @xmath28 which was measured by emc @xcite , led to the crisis of the naive parton model for the polarized deep - inelastic scattering @xcite . despite the understanding that the fundamental origin of this phenomenon is related to the non - conservation of the flavor singlet axial vector current due to axial anomaly , the explicit calculation for the value of the flavor singlet axial vector charge within qcd is absent so far @xcite .",
    "the main problem here is the poorly known nonperturbative sector of qcd , which does not allow to perform exact calculations .",
    "one possible way to explain the small value of @xmath28 is to investigate its connection with the effects of the axial anomaly in meson spectroscopy , and there have been many trials to connect the polarized dis anomaly with the anomalous properties of the @xmath29 meson , e.g. through the u(1)@xmath30 problem .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that because of its quantum numbers the pseudoscalar @xmath29 meson can not give a _ direct _ contribution to the double spin asymmetry in polarized dis , which was used to extract the value of the forward flavor singlet _ axial vector _ current matrix element , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the proton mass and @xmath33 is its spin .",
    "it is evident that only flavor singlet axial vector mesons can contribute to the left hand side of this equation .",
    "there are three axial vector mesons with the appropriate quantum numbers [ @xmath34 contribute to this matrix element : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the anomalous value of the nucleon matrix element of the singlet axial vector current implies an anomalous mixing for these axial vector mesons , similar to what happens in the case of the pseudoscalars .",
    "this mixing implies a strong violation of the ozi rule and therefore a strong gluonic admixture @xcite . from the point of view of the present investigation",
    "the mixing is not important , what really matters is the role played by the lightest meson in this channel , the @xmath35 , in the whole procedure .",
    "this meson behaves in the vector axial three isosinglet case in the same way as the @xmath38 behaves in the pseudoscalar case , namely it saturates the anomaly .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to estimate the effects of the @xmath35-exchange in elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering and vector - meson photoproduction , and in so doing display the special role played by its regge trajectory , as a consequence of the properties of the vacuum of qcd . throughout this paper",
    ", @xmath25 stands for the @xmath35 state and we will neglect the possible admixture of the other hadronic states to the wave function of the @xmath25-meson .",
    "let us briefly review some of the results of sec .",
    "iii of ref .",
    "@xcite to adapt them to our purpose .",
    "the matrix element of the axial vector current can be rewritten as a sum over all possible intermediate states by using the idea of the axial vector dominance : @xmath39 where @xmath40 s are the axial vector meson states characterized by their corresponding flavor quantum numbers .",
    "this expression provides relations between the axial charges of the nucleon and the coupling constants of the axial vector mesons with the nucleon , @xmath41 given by @xmath42 here the decay constants are defined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the polarization vector of the meson .",
    "the eighth component of the flavor octet @xmath45 will be identified with the @xmath36 @xcite .    from the data on the decay of @xmath46 one obtains @xcite",
    "@xmath47 then the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ gnn ] ) gives @xmath48 the analogue with the @xmath49 and @xmath50 reduced matrix elements for the axial vector currents allows to estimate the coupling constant of the flavor singlet axial vector meson with the nucleon as in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath51 note if we use the su(3 ) relations for the decay constants of the axial vector meson octet , @xmath52 , and the su(6 ) relation between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , then we obtain a larger value , @xmath56 .",
    "the last equation in eq . ( [ gnn ] ) gives @xmath57 by using the axial vector charge @xmath58 which was found recently @xcite by fitting the world data on the spin - dependent structure function @xmath59 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the estimates ( [ singlet ] ) and ( [ sidor ] ) are probably just _ upper _ limits for the corresponding magnitudes , because of the uncertainties in the extrapolation of flavor singlet part of the spin dependent structure function @xmath59 to the low @xmath60 region . at any rate",
    "we find that the violation of the su(6 ) symmetry for the decay constants of axial vector mesons is very large and @xmath61 .",
    "a similar effect was discussed by veneziano and shore @xcite for the case of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "they have shown that the small value of the decay constant of the flavor singlet @xmath62 meson and @xmath28 is ascribed not to the properties of this meson itself but to the general properties of the qcd vacuum , namely to the phenomena of topological charge screening in the vacuum , @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the so - called topological susceptibility , @xmath66 then the smallness of the decay constant @xmath67 can be thought to have the same origin , since using eqs .",
    "( [ gnn ] ) and ( [ scr ] ) one can relate this constant with @xmath68 , @xmath69 where we have neglected the mass difference of the @xmath25 and @xmath45 .    from all of the above discussion",
    "we conclude that the properties of the @xmath25 are very different from those of the other mesons that belong to the same su(6 ) multiplet , e.g. the @xmath70 and @xmath36 mesons .",
    "furthermore they imply a dominating behavior in the cross sections when the @xmath25 meson contributes and which leads in general to unexpected and thereby anomalous results . in order to establish these facts in a concrete manner",
    "we proceed to calculate the contribution of the @xmath25 meson for two processes , elastic @xmath26 scattering at large @xmath71 and elastic photoproduction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "these calculations will indeed show that the exchange of the @xmath25 meson produces important contributions in these processes .",
    "before we conclude this section we would like to compare the @xmath25 with the anomalous pomeron , for the reason that have been mentioned in the introduction .",
    "equation ( [ scr ] ) follows from the consideration of the _ axial anomaly _",
    "contribution to the non - conservation of the flavor singlet axial vector current , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of flavors and @xmath74 is the topological charge density . due to its relation with the axial anomaly ,",
    "the properties of the @xmath25-exchange are related with the distribution of the topological charge in qcd vacuum .",
    "it is well - known that nonperturbative fluctuations of gluon fields called instantons give rise to the nontrivial topological structure of the qcd vacuum ( see a recent review in ref .",
    "the average size of the instantons in this vacuum is much smaller than the confinement radius , @xmath75 therefore the @xmath25-exchange should contribute to the hadronic cross sections at higher values of the momentum transfer than the pomeron - exchange whose @xmath76-dependence is determined approximately by the isoscalar electromagnetic form factor of the hadrons participating in the process @xcite . for the @xmath77 vertex , we shall use the flavor singlet axial vector form factor @xmath78 with @xmath79 gev .",
    "this is comparable to the estimate of the isosinglet axial form factor of ref .",
    "@xcite , which gives @xmath80 using the skyrme model .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite on the flavor octet axial form factor favor @xmath81 .",
    "this form factor decreases slower with increasing @xmath71 than the isoscalar electromagnetic form factor of the pomeron - nucleon vertex @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the usual dipole fit .",
    "therefore the @xmath25 contribution will dominate over the pomeron contribution at large @xmath71 . in this paper",
    "we will show explicitly this behavior in elastic proton - proton scattering and vector - meson photoproduction .",
    "one very interesting feature of the available data on hadron - hadron scattering at high energy is their universality @xcite .",
    "this means that at low momentum transfer @xmath84 gev@xmath85 and large energy @xmath86 gev all data are described rather well by the pomeron - exchange .",
    "it was shown also that the shrinkage of the diffractive peak with increasing energy can be explained by the following pomeron trajectory , @xmath87 with the pomeron intercept @xmath88 and slope @xmath89 gev@xmath12 .    at @xmath90 gev@xmath85 and large energy , however , the experimental data for the differential cross sections for elastic proton - proton and proton  anti - proton scattering show a very different behavior .",
    "the differential cross sections in this kinematical region do not show _ any _ energy dependence and are only functions of the momentum transfer @xmath76 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] ) several explanations for the large @xmath71 data have been suggested .",
    "the most popular one is the donnachie - landshoff odderon - exchange model based on a perturbative three - gluon exchange mechanism between nucleon quarks @xcite . in this model",
    ", however , the average momentum transfer in each quark - quark subprocess in the experimental range of @xmath76 is rather small , @xmath91 gev , and therefore justification for its applicability is still unclear @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "the validity of the perturbative approach to qcd to explain nucleon - nucleon elastic scattering data is even less clear for the sotiropoulos - sterman model @xcite where a six - gluon effective exchange mechanism between nucleons was considered .",
    "the new trajectory , which we relate to the effective @xmath25-exchange and to the manifestation of axial anomaly in the strong interaction , gives a more natural explanation to this experimental data . in this section , we calculate the contribution of the @xmath25-exchange to the differential cross section for proton - proton elastic scattering at large energy , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; @xmath94 the lagrangian of the @xmath25-meson interaction with the nucleon for a point - like vertex is @xmath95 which allows the @xmath25-exchange to generate non - spin - flip amplitudes in nucleon - nucleon scattering .",

    "@xmath108 gev@xmath85 is small at large @xmath71 compared with the @xmath25-exchange and can be neglected in this kinematical region .",
    "of course at large energy the meson - exchange should be reggeized due to the contributions from the mesons of higher spin , @xmath109 , which belong to the same trajectory . as discussed above , however , there is a difference in the characteristic scales for the pomeron and the new trajectory . in the former ,",
    "the scale is determined by the interactions between quarks at the distance related to the confinement radius , while in the latter it is related to the axial charge distribution ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "therefore the two trajectories should have different slopes and @xmath110 the flatness of the new trajectory leads to small contributions of the heavier mesons to the cross sections .",
    "for example , with the slope ( [ slope ] ) the next meson from the new trajectory with @xmath111 should have a mass @xmath112 gev as determined from the equation , @xmath113 in order to obtain a reasonable estimate we can safely neglect the contributions from the heavier mesons and take the contribution of the new trajectory as a fixed pole with @xmath114 .",
    "the quantum numbers of this new trajectory are determined by the quantum numbers of the @xmath25 meson : the signature is @xmath115 with the parities @xmath4 .",
    "thus the new trajectory should have the same contribution to @xmath26 and @xmath116 collisions .",
    "this property is different from the charge odd odderon - exchange .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the interaction of the new exchange with some hadronic state is determined by the value of the flavor singlet axial vector charge of the hadron .",
    "this leads to the vanishing of the contributions of this trajectory to the total cross sections of the elastic reactions @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , etc , because the axial vector charge of pseudoscalar mesons is zero . one further consequence of the dominance of the new trajectory is that at large @xmath71 the elastic @xmath120 cross section , that is determined by the pomeron - exchange , should have very different @xmath76 and @xmath99 dependence in comparison with the @xmath26 case .",
    "the experimental data @xcite support this conclusion .",
    "one of the features of this new trajectory is that it is responsible for the _ spin dependence _ of the lepton - hadron , photon - hadron , and hadron - hadron cross sections at large energies .",
    "thus the exchange of this trajectory should determine the behavior of the flavor singlet part of the spin - dependent structure function @xmath121 at @xmath122 : @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "similar behavior with @xmath125 for the neutron structure function was found by e154 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of the neutron structure function @xmath126 is the smallness of the valence quark contribution .",
    "therefore the behavior of this function is determined by the flavor singlet contribution in the experimentally available range of @xmath60 . for the proton target",
    "the valence quark contribution is very large and the behavior in @xmath60 follows the @xmath70 trajectory contribution in this range of @xmath60 .",
    "thus the neutron target is more suitable to investigate the new trajectory in polarized dis .",
    "the recent hera data for vector - meson photoproduction @xcite are now the subject for discussion in the different approaches @xcite .",
    "the interest to these data is related to the possible check of different nonperturbative and perturbative qcd models for particle photoproduction . in spite of the success of several models in the description of some properties of vector - meson photoproduction ,",
    "a complete theory is not available so far .",
    "indeed , the new zeus data for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath127 photoproduction @xcite show that the perturbative approach may describe only @xmath127 photoproduction .",
    "we also note that the nonperturbative approaches based on the dominant contribution of the _ universal _ pomeron trajectory fail to explain the cross sections at large momentum transfer @xmath71 . furthermore , the mechanisms which are responsible for the specific polarization properties of the electromagnetic production of vector mesons has not been clarified until now .",
    "for example , it is very hard for such models to explain the large double spin asymmetry in @xmath2 meson electroproduction at relatively small value of @xmath128 observed recently by the hermes collaboration @xcite .",
    "the specific features of the new trajectory can be extracted from the experimental data of vector - meson production . as we discussed above , because of the different @xmath76-dependence of the form factors in the pomeron - nucleon and @xmath25-nucleon vertices this new trajectory should dominate over the pomeron contribution at large @xmath71 region . to demonstrate the effect of the new trajectory we present here the numerical results for @xmath24 and @xmath3 photoproduction at large energy @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the center of mass energy of the photon - nucleon system .",

    "the @xmath25-exchange contribution gives rise to nonvanishing values for @xmath209 at small @xmath71 region , while the pomeron model predicts @xmath211 at this region .",
    "it should be mentioned that recently the first measurements of the double spin asymmetries for vector - meson electroproduction was reported by the hermes collaboration @xcite .",
    "they found large asymmetry for @xmath2 meson electroproduction with @xmath212 gev@xmath85 .",
    "the asymmetries of @xmath3 and @xmath127 electroproduction could not be measured accurately and can not give any definite conclusion to these asymmetries .",
    "nevertheless , the data on the double spin asymmetry of @xmath2 electroproduction could not be explained by the pomeron - exchange model and we propose the @xmath25-exchange as a possible candidate which gives nonvanishing double spin asymmetries at high energy .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath5 meson plays a very special role in some hadronic processes in the large energy and large momentum transfer region due to its special relation to the axial anomaly through the matrix elements of the axial vector current .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of another effective particle with a very dominant behavior in hadron physics in this region , the pomeron , whose relation with the conformal anomaly seems to be the motivation behind this behavior .",
    "therefore it seems natural to describe the properties of the lightest @xmath25 in terms of regge theory by associating to this resonance an anomalous trajectory , the odd signature companion of the even signature pomeron .",
    "our analysis of proton - proton scattering and vector - meson photoproduction has confirmed our suspicions .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath25-exchange to the cross sections of these processes does not depend on the energy , a clear signature of its anomalous regge behavior .",
    "we have found that the @xmath25-meson exchange can explain the differential cross sections of proton - proton scattering at large energy and large momentum transfer .",
    "the difference in the spin structure of the vertices of the @xmath25-trajectory from the pomeron - exchange leads to their different contributions to the polarized proton - proton scattering and polarized vector - meson photoproduction . as a result",
    ", this trajectory gives non - zero values for the beam - target double spin asymmetries in both processes , and can be distinguished from the pomeron - exchange model .",
    "these examples show the importance of the new trajectory in hadron reactions , and can be tested , for example , by the @xmath213 experiment at rhic @xcite , where a wide program to measure various spin - dependent elastic and total cross sections has been suggested .",
    "( see recent discussions in ref . @xcite . )    as another test of the new trajectory , we suggest to investigate @xmath214 photoproduction , which decays mostly into @xmath215 . since the @xmath216 has quantum numbers @xmath217 , the empirical gribov - morrison rule @xcite prohibits the pomeron - exchange in this process , and because of the @xmath218 parity vector - meson - exchanges such as @xmath219 and @xmath2 can not contribute .",
    "the possible pseudoscalar - meson exchange contribution , however , gives usually decreasing total cross section with the initial energy , while experiments @xcite show approximately constant total cross section at large energies .",
    "therefore , we expect that the new trajectory related with the @xmath25 may give important contribution to @xmath216 photoproduction .",
    "but the currently available data on this reaction @xcite are very limited and new experiments at current electron facilities are strongly called for .    we also suggest to analyze the asymmetry @xmath220 of the two - meson decays of vector - mesons produced by linearly polarized photon beams @xcite . since this asymmetry is @xmath221 for natural parity exchange and @xmath222 for unnatural parity exchange , the @xmath25 contribution would be found from deviations of this quantity from @xmath221 at large energy .    in summary , in the energy region of the analyzed experiments two trajectories ,",
    "the pomeron and the @xmath25 , dominate the total cross sections and the asymmetries . and ,",
    "therefore , this new anomalous regge trajectory , which is responsible for spin effects at large energy , should be considered as a natural odd signature companion to the pomeron .",
