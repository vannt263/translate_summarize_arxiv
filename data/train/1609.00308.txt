    "optical tweezing ( ot ) technique may be achieved whenever a highly focused laser beam is shone onto a small _ transparent _ object ( say , a microsized sphere ) immersed in water or other suitable medium . whenever the sphere refraction index is greater than water one ( like the widely used polysterene or silica microspheres ) , the refractive force balance the reflective drifting enabling bead trapping around the optical focus , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . eventually , by displacing the laser beam , or the background plate support , the sphere may be also moved .",
    "optical tweezing appears to be a very important technique to manipulate objects sensitive to tiny forces , around _",
    "piconewton _ scale ,",
    "namely , to study small systems , from single molecules to those around 100 @xmath0 m , without direct contact . among many other applications , ot has been shown to be a valuable tool for biophysics whenever investigating mechanical properties of proteins , membranes , dna / rna , and so forth@xcite .",
    "+ three - dimensional topological insulators ( ti s , for short ) comprise a class of quantum state of matter with an insulating bulk and gapless metallic surface states protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "typical examples include crystals like bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and sb@xmath1te@xmath2 . among other peculiarities ,",
    "a surface charge carrier moves in such a way that its linear momentum is always perpendicular to its spin , the so - called _ spin - momentum locking _ @xcite .",
    "the surface states are robust against non - magnetic impurities , whereas a magnetic disorder breaks time reversal symmetry and it open a gap at the dirac points .",
    "whenever fermi level lies within this gap , an external electromagnetic field induces hall effect , with conductivity @xmath3 , ref .",
    "magnetic dopant , such as @xmath4 or @xmath5 , yields a gap around @xmath6 mev for as - grown bi@xmath1se@xmath2 crystals , as reported in ref .",
    "+ by virtue of these unique microscopic properties , it follows that an external electric ( magnetic ) field induces a magnetization ( polarization ) in the ti , the so - called topological magnetoelectric effect ( tmee ) .",
    "in addition , whenever interacting with light the topological insulator rotates the polarization plane of reflected and transmitted / refracted beams . indeed , although the reflected ray experiences a small faraday rotation , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the fine structure constant ) , the transmitted wave is affected by a _ giant _",
    "kerr effect , @xmath9 .",
    "such a pronounced kerr rotation is the effect behind the appearance of a residual constant force , @xmath10 , exerted on a small ti - made bead by a focused light .",
    "although tiny , around some dozens of _ femtonewtons _ , @xmath10 may be useful for stretching or displacing small objects with optical control , thus opening the possibilities to investigate soft matter and biophysical systems under true dynamical response .",
    "when light ray is sent to a bead , the reflection always push it along the beam by radiation pressure : @xmath11 @xmath12 is the refractive index of the medium surrounding the particle ( ot techniques frequently utilizes de - ionized water , @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the vacuum light speed , and @xmath15 is the laser beam power , around _ miliwatts _ in typical experiments .",
    "therefore , we are talking about very tiny forces , ranging at _ piconewton _ scale , @xmath16 . alternatively , this force may be computed by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the sphere cross - section and @xmath19 is the time - average of the poynting vector@xcite .",
    "+ in turn , transparency of the bead provides restoring forces comes from light refraction .",
    "two distinct limiting cases , concerning the ratio between the particle size / radius , @xmath20 , and radiation wavelength , @xmath21 , are in order : + * a ) * rayleigh regime : @xmath22 @xmath23 which is the so - called gradient force , pointing towards @xmath24 is more strength , say , the optical focus ( fig .",
    "1 ) . @xmath25 is the ratio between particle and medium electric permittivities .",
    "+ * b ) * geometrical optics regime : @xmath26 + now , the net restoring force coming from all multiple refractions occurring inside the bead may be estimated , considering a gaussian beam profile , to read like below@xcite : @xmath27p_{\\rm beam}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is defined by : @xmath29 @xmath30 ^ 2 + \\frac12 \\left[\\frac{\\tan(\\theta_i-\\theta_t)}{\\tan(\\theta_i+\\theta_t)}\\right]^2\\,.\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the incident and refracted angles , fig .",
    "1 . recall that reflectivity + transmittivity equals unity , @xmath33 .",
    "+ it should be emphasized that for an arbitrary ratio , @xmath34 , mie - debye treatment taking into account spherical aberration is necessary .",
    "+ in words , the two optical forces act in opposite ways : the radiation pressure always push the object tending to drift it away , whereas the restoring force , provided by light refraction , pulls the bead towards the optical focus .",
    "whenever the dielectric particle refraction index is greater than that of the surrounding medium , refractive force overcomes radiation pressure in such a way that the optical focus comes to be the stable point , around which the bead is trapped .",

    "the scenario may be understood as induced sources on the ti surface exhibiting hall effect @xcite , say , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the hall charge and current densities induced on the ti surface as a response to the applied fields .",
    "+ whenever light comes into the game , the non - trivial boundary conditions imposed by the hall sources on the normal electric , @xmath52 , and transverse magnetic fields , @xmath53 , along with the usual ones for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , yield topological kerr and faraday effects given by@xcite : @xmath56 although the refracted / transmitted beam is almost insensitive to these hall sources , once @xmath57 , the reflected rays experience a huge change in their polarization direction , @xmath9 ( note that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are affected only by very small contributions , say , at second order in @xmath8 : @xmath60 ) .",
    "such a giant kerr effect , mainly acting on the secondary rays producing multiple reflections at the interface inside the sphere , open us the possibility of using light to move ti - made beads by means of an extra optical force coming from topological grounds , as below .",
    "our main result comes about from the simple fact that the huge kerr effect yields a non - vanishing radiation pressure on a ti - made sphere which is _ perpendicular to the incidence plane _ , @xmath61 .",
    "such a force presents a leading term linear in @xmath8 and it is directed along @xmath62 , as illustrated in fig . 2 , and may readily obtained as follows : @xmath63 where @xmath18 is the ti - sphere cross - section and @xmath64 is the time - average of the poynting vector associated to the kerr reflected radiation ; we have also used , @xmath65 , eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath66 accounts for the summation over multiple reflections and refractions ( ray optics framework , @xmath26 ) .",
    "[ whenever working within rayleigh regime , @xmath22 , one realizes that @xmath67 identically vanishes once upper hemisphere contribution exactly cancels that coming from below the sphere equator . as a net result",
    ", the bead is expected to only self - rotates at this regime , without displacing elsewhere ] .",
    "it is a length expression depending on the refractive indexes and on the incident and transmitted angles , similarly to the factor @xmath28 , eq , ( [ qt ] ) , and it is evaluated in the appendix .",
    "it may be also faced as an effective cross - section ( form - factor ) of the ti - sphere whenever experiencing kerr rotation .",
    "2 shows the behavior and magnitude of @xmath68 as function of @xmath31 .",
    "+ note that @xmath69 goes around some dozens of _ femtonewton _ , say , @xmath70 times radiation pressure magnitude @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , it is small to jeopardize laser focalization on the colloidal particles . on the other hand , it may be useful to move very small particles , like single molecules and molecular motors , with constant acceleration perpendicularly to the polarization plane , say , @xmath62-axis , as depicted in fig .",
    "2 . it may also be useful to investigate a number of dynamical properties of polymers , membranes etc under controlled mechanical stretching provided by a constant force .",
    "+ furthermore , let us recall that typically used dielectric spheres have around a few microns , say , @xmath72 , leading to mass about @xmath73 ( density around @xmath74 , for polystyrene and mica ) .",
    "therefore , radiation pressure or gradient force would input high acceleration to the beads , @xmath75 , if they acted isolated .",
    "the topological force brought about here produces a much smaller acceleration : taking ti - sphere with @xmath76 and density @xmath77 ( value for @xmath78 ) , then @xmath67 yields acceleration around @xmath79 .",
    "such an acceleration is capable of producing high mobility to the ti - beads , making them to displace thousands of their size in just 1 second .    , it may be used to push very small bodies attached to ti - bead along the direction perpendicular to the incidence plane .",

    "+ from the experimental point of view , the measurement of @xmath67 may be challenging .",
    "at least two aspects must be emphasized : + first , ti - made beads surface should be submitted to a perpendicular magnetic field in order to open an energy gap responsible for the appearance of the tmme and hence the giant kerr rotation .",
    "the best way to achieve this condition is by growing ti - beads around an even smaller sphere / bead of ferromagnetic material .",
    "+ second , kerr force has a tiny magnitude .",
    "for instance , whether and how it can overwhelm viscous forces in colloidal particles systems is one of the key points towards its detection .",
    "for that , ti - made beads with precise size and mass along with suitable viscous liquid are in order . for instance , if we intend to use casimir - type forces@xcite , ranging at the same scale of @xmath67 , @xmath84 fn , to probe it . an key feature of the kerr force relies on its constance , in magnitude and orientation , rendering a relatively clear way to distinguish its effects ( say , acceleration ) from those associated to viscous and other medium - attributed forces , generally expected to be almost anisotropic and working randomly on the spherical bead .",
