    "phase separation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature @xcite .",
    "a most prominent example familiar to everyone is that oil and water do not mix . besides that",
    ", the phenomenon of water in coexistence with its vapor can also be understood as a type of phase separation @xcite . in general , two phases mix or not depending on which configuration",
    "minimizes the energy or free energy of the whole system . with the realization of bose - einstein condensation in ultracold atomic gases , another example of phase separation",
    "is offered by two - component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "in such a system , phase mixing or separation means the two condensates overlap or not spatially , which correspond to different interaction energies . a widely accepted condition for phase separation , which is based on the consideration of minimizing the interaction energy @xcite ,",
    "is given by @xmath14 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the intra - component interaction strengths of components @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , while @xmath3 is the interaction strength between them @xcite .",
    "this condition is intuitively reasonable since if the inter - component interaction is too strong , the two components would like to get separated from each other .",
    "experimentally , controlled miscibility - immiscibility transition of a two - component bec based on the idea of adjusting the values of the @xmath13 s using feshbach resonance and so as to get ( [ cond ] ) satisfied or not has been demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "now the point is that though the condition above is very appealing in its simplicity and usefulness , it has great limitations . in its derivation , the condensates are assumed to be uniform and the kinetic energy associated with the boundary / interface layers is neglected .",
    "the problem is then reduced to minimizing the total interaction energy , or more specifically , to weighing the inter - component interaction against the intra - component interaction .",
    "this approximation is legitimate if the widths of the boundary / interface layers are much smaller than the extension of the condensates , or in other words , if the boundary / interface layers are well defined .",
    "however , this condition is not necessarily satisfied in all circumstances .",
    "actually , some simple scaling analysis may tell us when it will fail .",
    "consider a condensate trapped in a @xmath4-dimensional container of size @xmath5 .",
    "the characteristic ( average ) density of the condensate is on the order of @xmath17 .",
    "according to the mean - field ( gross - pitaevskii ) theory , the healing length of the condensate , which determines the widths of the boundary / interface layers , will be on the order of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "thus we see that in one and three dimensional cases , it makes sense to say boundary / interface layers only in the limits of @xmath10 and @xmath9 , respectively . in the opposite limits , the `` boundary / interface ''",
    "layers overtake the condensates themselves in size , which signals that the kinetic energy will dominate the interaction energy and should no longer be neglected .",
    "the two dimensional case is more subtle in that the widths of the boundary / interface layers scale in the same way with the sizes of the condensates , which at least means that the kinetic energy should not be neglected _ a priori_.    the analysis above indicates that the kinetic energy is likely to play a vital role in determining the configuration of a two - component bec .",
    "moreover , we note that the kinetic energy acts against the inter - component interaction .",
    "the latter is responsible for phase separation while the former tries to expand the condensates and thus favors phase mixing .",
    "therefore , it is expected that phase separation can be suppressed by the kinetic energy in some circumstances even if the condition ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied @xcite .",
    "notably , according to the argument above , the significance of the kinetic energy can be controlled by changing the size of the container .",
    "that is , the phase mixing - demixing transition can be controlled by a geometrical method , instead of the mechanical method of changing the values of the @xmath13 s , which is based on ( [ cond ] ) and is demonstrated in refs .",
    "the considerations above have led us to investigate the scenario of suppressing phase separation in a two - component bec by kinetic energy .",
    "we will start from the simplest and most generic case of a two - component bec in a @xmath4-dimensional infinitely deep square well potential ( of width @xmath5 ) .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition implies that the condensate wave functions must be non - uniform and the kinetic energy is at least on the order of @xmath19 . on the contrary , inside the well ,",
    "the potential energy is zero .",
    "therefore , we have a pure competition between the kinetic energy and the inter - component interaction energy , if the intra - component interactions are set zero [ note that in this case , condition ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied ] . in this simplest model , in all dimensions ( @xmath7 , 2 , 3 ) , we do observe that phase separation can be completely suppressed by the kinetic energy in some regime .",
    "of course , different dimensions have different features .",
    "but all these effects and features carry over to the more realistic case of @xmath4-dimensional harmonic potentials .    in the mean - field theory and at zero - temperature , the energy functional of a two - component bec in a @xmath4-dimensional infinitely deep square well potential @xmath20^d$ ] is of the form @xmath21 & = & \\int_{\\omega } d \\vec{r }",
    "\\bigg\\ {   \\sum_{\\alpha=1,2 } \\frac{n_\\alpha\\hbar^2}{2m_\\alpha}|\\nabla \\psi_\\alpha|^2 \\quad \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\quad + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta=1,2 } g_{\\alpha\\beta }    n_\\alpha n_\\beta |\\psi_\\alpha|^2|\\psi_\\beta|^2    \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the two condensate wave functions are normalized to unity @xmath22 , and @xmath23 on the boundary",
    ". note that throughout this paper we are only concerned with the ground configuration of the system , therefore all the wave functions can be taken to be real and positive .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath24 are the effective intra- and inter - component interaction strengths .",
    "finally , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the atom numbers and atom masses of the two species , respectively .",
    "now we should note that for an arbitrary set of parameters , in the ground configuration , almost definitely , the two wave functions do overlap but do not coincide with each other ( this can be easily understood in terms of the gross - pitaevskii equations for @xmath27 ) . in this case",
    ", it is far from trivial to distinguish phase separation and phase mixing .",
    "a method proposed in @xcite is to consider the centers of mass of the two condensates : @xmath28 this idea is motivated by the observation that in some regime , both the two condensates are symmetric with respect to the origin while in other regime , both of them are asymmetric with respect to the origin , and more importantly , they are shifted in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "apparently , the former case is with @xmath29 and it is appropriate to call it phase - mixed while the latter case is with @xmath30 and it is appropriate to call it phase - separated .",
    "therefore , the offset between the two centers of mass @xmath31 can serve as an order parameter for the miscibility - immiscibility transition of the system .",
    "though this order parameter works well for a general case , we will not use it much in this paper .",
    "actually , instead of studying a general case , we shall focus on the symmetric energy functional case , i.e. , the case when @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the reason is that this special case not only captures all the essential physics , but also has an extra merit .",
    "that is , now it is possible to have @xmath35 , which corresponds to a completely mixed configuration .",
    "therefore , in this special case , an appropriate order parameter is the overlap between the two condensate wave functions ( or more precisely , @xmath36 , if phase separation is concerned ) : @xmath37 which takes values between 0 and 1 . if @xmath38 , it would be fair to say the system shows phase separation . otherwise , if @xmath39 is close to 1 , or more precisely if @xmath40 , it would be fair to say the system shows phase mixing . in the intermediate case , the system is partially phase - separated and partially phase - mixed .",
    "now make the transform @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath43 and @xmath44 on the boundary of @xmath45 , where @xmath46^d$ ] . in terms of the rescaled wave functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the energy functional ( [ fun1 ] ) , under the assumption above , can be rewritten as @xmath49=\\frac{n\\hbar^2}{m l^2 } \\int_{\\omega_0 } d \\vec{x } \\bigg\\ { \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla \\phi_1|^2 + \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla \\phi_2|^2 \\",

    "the coefficients of the kinetic terms are constant , yet the coefficients of the interaction terms ( the @xmath52 s ) scale with @xmath5 as @xmath53 .",
    "this fact has some important consequences . if @xmath7 , there are two different limits . in the limit of @xmath10 ( loose confinement ) ,",
    "the kinetic terms are dominated by the interaction terms and thus the ground state can be determined by simply minimizing the interaction energy . in this limit",
    ", the textbook analysis is valid and we have phase separation if condition ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied or phase mixing otherwise . in the opposite limit of @xmath9 ( tight confinement ) ,",
    "the kinetic terms will dominate and the two rescaled wave functions can be well approximated by the ground state of the square well potential , i.e. , @xmath54 . in this limit , phase separation will be suppressed whatever the values of the @xmath13 s are , even if ( [ cond ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the three dimensional case is the inverse of the one dimensional case . in the limit of @xmath9 ,",
    "the kinetic terms are negligible and the criterion of phase separation ( [ cond ] ) is valid . in the other limit of @xmath55 , the kinetic terms dominate and phase separation is suppressed regardless of the condition ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the two dimensional case is another story .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 simply drops out in the curl bracket .",
    "it is no use to adjust the width of the well to enhance the importance of the kinetic energy or the interaction energy relatively .",
    "the kinetic and interaction energies should be treated on an equal footing , which means the analysis leading to criterion ( [ cond ] ) may be invalid .",
    "we have checked all these predictions numerically .",
    "note that on the problem of phase separation , the intra - component interactions are on the same side as the kinetic energy ",
    "they both try to delocalize the condensates .",
    "therefore , to highlight the effect of kinetic energy , we shall set @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , so that the kinetic energy is the only element acting against phase separation . as we shall see below , this special case also admits a simple analytical analysis .    we have solved the ground state of the system in all dimensions for a given value of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the overlap factor @xmath39 is plotted versus @xmath58 in fig .",
    "we observe that in all dimensions , there exists a critical value of @xmath58 ( denoted as @xmath59 ) , below which the two condensates wave functions are equal ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "that is , for @xmath61 , phase separation is completely suppressed . above the critical value ,",
    "phase separation develops ( @xmath62 ) as @xmath58 increases , but is still greatly suppressed for a wide range of value of @xmath58 .",
    "it should be stressed that though in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a the curves of @xmath63 are qualitatively similar to each another for all values of @xmath4 ( the plateau of @xmath64 is always located in the direction of @xmath65 ) , the curves of @xmath66 will be quite different .",
    "the reason is that @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig1]b is a schematic plot of @xmath39 versus @xmath5 in all the three cases .",
    "it shows that @xmath39 as a function of @xmath5 is monotonically decreasing , constant , and monotonically increasing in one , two , and three dimensions , respectively .",
    "this means that to suppress phase separation , in one dimension we should tighten the confinement , in three dimensions we should loosen the confinement , while in two dimensions it is useless to change the confinement .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] confirms the initial conjecture that kinetic energy can suppress phase separation .    as a hindsight",
    ", we can actually understand why phase separation can be suppressed in the limits of @xmath68 in one dimension and @xmath10 in three dimensions .",
    "consider two different configurations .",
    "the first one is a phase - separated one  the two condensates occupy the left and right halves of the container separately .",
    "the second one is a phase - mixed one  the two condensates both occupy the whole space available and thus overlap significantly .",
    "compared with the first configuration , the second one costs more inter - component interaction energy which is on the order of @xmath17 , but saves more kinetic energy which is on the order of @xmath19 .",
    "the second configuration ( phase - mixed ) is more economical in energy in the limit of @xmath69 and @xmath10 , in the cases of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the case of @xmath11 is more subtle and which configuration wins depends on parameters other than @xmath5 .",
    "a remarkable fact revealed in fig .  [ fig1 ] but",
    "not so obvious in our arguments is that in the symmetric case with @xmath57 , @xmath64 for @xmath70 , which is on the order of unity .",
    "this is a stronger fact than @xmath71 as @xmath72 as we argued . actually , the general observation is that for @xmath73 , @xmath64 for @xmath58 smaller than its critical value @xmath74 , which is larger than @xmath75 .",
    "this fact has rich meanings .",
    "on the one hand , it demonstrates that the kinetic energy is very effective  phase separation can be _ completely suppressed _ by it even if @xmath76 , i.e. , when ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied . on the other hand",
    ", it strongly indicates that as @xmath58 crosses the critical value , the system undergoes a second order phase transition which can fit in the landau formalism .",
    "the picture is that the exchange symmetry @xmath77 of the energy functional ( [ fun2 ] ) is preserved for @xmath78 , but is spontaneously broken as @xmath58 surpasses @xmath59 .",
    "we have been able to prove the first point rigorously on the mathematical level ( see appendix [ apprigor ] ) . however , it is also desirable to develop a physical understanding of the two points",
    ". this can be achieved by studying a two - component bec in a double - well potential ( see appendix [ appspon ] ) or using a variational approach @xcite .",
    "we note that in the limit of @xmath65 , @xmath47 both converge to the ( non - degenerate ) ground state of a single particle in the @xmath79^d$ ] infinitely deep square well .",
    "as @xmath58 is turned on , the two wave functions are deformed and excited states mix in . because the energies of the excited states grow up quadratically , we cutoff at the first excited level and take the following ansatz for the two condensate wave functions @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the ground state , while @xmath82 is one of the possibly degenerate first excited states .",
    "the coefficients @xmath83 are real and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath84 .",
    "obviously , complete phase mixing would correspond to @xmath85 while partial phase separation to @xmath86 .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that ( this is also supported by the variational approach itself , see appendix [ appc ] ) in the two dimensional case , when phase separation occurs , the two condensates are shifted either along @xmath87 or @xmath88 direction ; in the three dimensional case , when phase separation occurs , the two condensates are shifted either along @xmath87 or @xmath88 or @xmath89 direction .",
    "this fact motivates us to choose @xmath82 in the following form    [ trial2 ] @xmath90    where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the ground and first excited states of a single particle in the one dimensional @xmath79 $ ] infinitely deep square well potential . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ trial ] ) and ( [ trial2 ] ) into ( [ fun2 ] ) , we get the reduced energy functional @xmath93 as    [ reduced e ] @xmath94    these are nothing but the landau s expression of the free energy in a second - order phase transition , with @xmath95 playing the role of the order parameter here .",
    "we immediately determine the critical values of @xmath58 by putting the coefficients of @xmath96 to zero .",
    "specifically , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for @xmath7 , @xmath11 , and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "these values agree with those extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] very well .",
    "the relative errors are within @xmath15% , @xmath100% , and @xmath101% , respectively .",
    "the deviation increases with @xmath4 because in higher dimensions , the degeneracy of the excited states increases and the two - mode approximation in ( [ trial ] ) becomes less accurate . in the expressions of @xmath102 , we can actually see how the kinetic energy suppresses phase separation .",
    "the term @xmath103 comes from the kinetic energy difference of the two modes @xmath104 . without this term",
    ", the critical value @xmath59 would be zero instead of being finite .    for a general case without the exchange symmetry @xmath105 ,",
    "the appropriate order parameter is no longer @xmath39 but @xmath106 .",
    "however , the second order transition picture still holds .",
    "specifically , @xmath107 for @xmath58 smaller than some critical value @xmath74 which is larger than @xmath108 .",
    "overall , this asymmetric case is more involved than the symmetric case above because there are more parameters .",
    "hopefully , a systematic study will be presented in a follow - up work .",
    "so far , we have focused on the ideal case of infinitely deep square wells .",
    "experimentally , it is harmonic potentials that are most readily realized .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to see whether analogous results hold for harmonic potentials .",
    "one concern is that the extra potential energy may blur the picture .",
    "however , after some similar rescaling , we shall see that all the results persist .",
    "the energy functional of a two - component bec in a @xmath4-dimensional isotropic harmonic potential is @xmath109 here again we have assumed equal mass and equal number for the two species .",
    "the two condensate wave functions are normalized to unity , i.e. , @xmath110 with @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the characteristic length of the harmonic potential .",

    "we have verified these predictions numerically . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have shown the overlap factor @xmath121 versus the reduced inter - component interaction strength @xmath58 in all dimensions ( with @xmath122 ) . again , we see that phase separation is completely suppressed for @xmath58 below some critical value @xmath59 .",
    "let us now consider the possibility of experimentally observing the immiscibility - miscibility transition by adjusting the confinement , e.g. , the frequency @xmath123 . in cold atom experiments ,",
