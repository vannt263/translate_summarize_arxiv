    "an alternative to indirectly estimate the water abundance in the galactic center ( gc ) is to use related species such as hdo @xcite or h@xmath25o@xmath26 @xcite . in none of these cases , the determination of @xmath13(h@xmath0o ) is straightforward .    the iso mission @xcite , and specially , the _ long wavelength spectrometer _ , lws , @xcite , and the _ short wavelength spectrometer _ ,",
    "sws , @xcite , have provided a unique opportunity to observe several h@xmath0o lines in a great variety of astronomical environments .",
    "nevertheless , the majority of these observations were performed at the low spectral resolution of the grating mode ( @xmath31000  km  s@xmath4 ) , which produces a critically strong dilution in the search for molecular features in most ism sources .",

    "opposite to what is found toward other star forming regions such as orion @xcite , the observations of the @xmath27 line at @xmath3179.5  @xmath28 m in sgr b2 show that the line appears in absorption rather than in emission @xcite .",

    "although the velocity resolution is @xmath31  km  s@xmath4 , the large beam of swas ( @xmath34@xmath24 ) makes these observations more sensitive to the cold and less dense gas .",
    "swas observations have provided a reliable estimate of the water vapor abundance in the low excitation clouds located in the line of sight toward sgr  b2 @xcite . however , the fact that only the ground - state absorption line is detected makes difficult a detailed study of water vapor excitation mechanisms in sgr  b2 itself .",

    "nevertheless , the warm and low density gas is poorly traced by radio observations of other molecular species ( generally excited by collisions in the denser regions and thus observed in emission ) .",

    "apart from self  absorption and the possible excitation by collisions with molecules ( e.g. h@xmath0 ) , atoms ( e.g. he ) and @xmath62 ( if the ionization fraction is significant ) , the level population can be primarily determined by the thermal emission of dust , the role of which is essential in the excitation of molecules such as h@xmath0o or oh which have many rotational lines in the far and mid  ir . this represents a major difference with respect to the excitation treatment of molecules observed in the radio domain where , generally , one can neglect the excitation by dust photons .",

    "this is the first observation of that line in a gc source and represents further evidence that water vapor is extended in warm molecular clouds .",
    "lvg and nonlocal radiative transfer calculations have been carried out to extract the water vapor abundance and to constrain the physical parameters of the absorbing / emitting regions .",
    "because of the radiative excitation by dust photons , the far  ir water lines are not very sensitive to t@xmath1 . taking into account the analysis of the related species oh @xcite , the water absorption must arise from warm gas at similar temperatures , i.e. , from 300 to 500  k. for this warm envelope , we found @xmath73(h@xmath0o)=@xmath96  @xmath12 .",
    "an important fraction of the 183.31  ghz emission arises from the inner , denser and colder gas located closer to the main cores .",
    "we estimate a water abundance of a few@xmath1010@xmath20 in the denser regions .",
    "photochemistry models show that a component of warm gas , @xmath3300 - 500  k , is needed to activate the neutral - neutral reactions and reproduce the large h@xmath0o and oh column densities observed in the envelope .",
    "we show that oh and h@xmath0o far  ir observations toward sgr  b2 are surface tracers of the cloud ( a maximum a@xmath101 of 5 to 10 mag ) .",
    "we found @xmath13(h@xmath0o)@xmath14(1 - 2)@xmath1010@xmath15 in these regions .",
    "although irradiated by fuv , and possibly more energetic photons , affecting the h@xmath0o / oh ratio in the outermost layers , a clumpy structure for the pdr is needed .",
    "alternatively , low velocity shocks could maintain the gas heating through the envelope .    due to the complexity of sgr  b2 ( and also of the gc ism as a whole ) a multiple scenario",
    "is needed to explain the modest angular resolution far ",
    "ir observations .",
    "the input of chemical models , and higher sensitivity and larger spatial resolution far  ir observations will lead to a better understanding of the gc environment .",
