    "we will focus on the question whether a phase transition exists , as found in the models of refs.@xcite , between the state of dominance of one language and an uniform distribution ( also called fragmentation ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section explains the model , the following section presents the results of the model with respect to its parameter space .",
    "the last section discusses the results and proposes further extensions of the model .",
    "the model in this paper combines population genetics with age  dependent language learning .",

    "[ [ the - sexual - penna - model ] ] the sexual penna model + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    is a individual  based model where every agent is represented by its age and two strings ( diploid ) of 32 bits .",
    "the bit  strings are read in parallel .",
    "every iteration after birth a new position on each of the bit ",
    "strings becomes visible .",
    "a bit set to one corresponds to an harmful allele . at the beginning of a simulation",
    "five positions are randomly chosen to be dominant ones .",
    "if the position is dominant one bit of the two bit  strings suffices to make the position represent a deleterious mutation . on the other positions both bits need to be set to one for deleterious effects . at the age",
    "at which an agent has its third deleterious mutation it dies . in order to avoid population explosion",
    "an additional factor limits its growth : the verhulst factor @xmath0 gives the probability of an agent to survive an iteration . here",

    "for each parent its two bit  strings are randomly crossed and recombined .",
    "both parents contribute one string to the offspring .",
    "the offspring suffers one deleterious mutation at a randomly chosen position on each of its both new strings .",
    "this high mutation rate lets the population reach a stationary distribution fast .",

    "the whole structure , a language should consist of , is neglected , and language is treated as an unit .",
    "each agent contributes one additional bit  string of @xmath5 bits representing its capability to speak a maximum of @xmath5 languages .",
    "so an agent who has for instance its third bit set , speaks currently language @xmath6 ( eventually among others ) .",
    "an agent can learn or forget a language only in youth during the first @xmath7 iterations after birth .",
    "we call @xmath7 the _ maximum learning age_. older agents are not able to change their knowledge on languages .",
    "the interaction between a young agent and a randomly chosen teaching agent works as follows : at first a random position on the language bit  string is chosen .",
    "the agent learns the language of that position if it is spoken by the teacher . if the agent already speaks more than one language it forgets the language of the chosen position if the teacher does not know it . in the other cases",
    "no process of learning / forgetting is carried out .",
    "let us illustrate the outcome of the interaction in computational terms : the language trait of an agent speaking zero or one language has an or operation with the teacher s one at the chosen position , otherwise an and operation .",
    "the young agents s language traits are actualized in this way by @xmath8 different teachers at different positions per iteration .",
    "@xmath9 means that the language traits are actualized once per iteration with a probability of @xmath10 . at birth",
    "an offspring obtains its language trait as illustrated in figure  [ fig : illustrate ] .",
    "if both parents speak the same language the offspring will speak it as well . in the case that only one of the parents speaks a language the child learns it with a probability of @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , the child can know a new language at birth with probability @xmath11 ( i.e. a randomly chosen bit position is set to one ) .",
    "we call this probability @xmath11 of erroneous learning the _ mutation rate _ in the following because of its analogy to biological systems .",
    "the bit  string is initialized by chance at the beginning of a simulation .",
    "this section will concentrate at first on the results of simulations with a trait of two languages ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the simulations are carried out for at least @xmath13 iterations or more for large population sizes .",
    "all results present the final stationary state of a simulation .",
    "a phase transition can be observed for the ratio between the number of speakers of different languages .",
    "the ratio is averaged over the last @xmath14 time steps .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasetr1 ] shows the ratio versus the mutation rate , determining the control parameter , for different carrying capacities @xmath2 .",
    "the simulations are carried out with a maximum learning age of @xmath15 and @xmath9 .",
    "each point represents the outcome of a separate simulation .",
    "the language ratio decreases fast at the critical point which is situated between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the transition separates the phase / state of about equal sizes for the two languages for small values of @xmath11 from the phase / state where one language dominates clearly the other one .",
    "we can observe in figure  [ fig : phasetr1 ] as well that the population size does not alter the shape of the transition .",
    "thus this transition can be found for arbitrary population numbers and therefore corresponds to a real physical phase transition .",
    "the language ratio increases strongly for low mutation rates .",
    "a power law with an exponent of minus one is exhibited in figure  [ fig : powerlaw ] .",
    "this exponent is the same for all simulations presented here .",
    "the parameters in the simulations are @xmath15 , @xmath9 and @xmath18 , i.e. the population consists of about @xmath19 agents .     as well as with increasing amount @xmath8 of interaction per iteration.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : phase_interact ] the shape of the phase transition is compared for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , parameters defining the amount of interaction between the agents . the carrying capacity @xmath20 fixes the population number at around @xmath21 .",
    "the shape of the transition remains the same but is shifted to higher values of the mutation rate for increasing @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the shift is a linear one with respect to each of both parameters .",
    "the shift decreases for values of @xmath22 as expected due to the smaller number of individuals surviving up to ages much older than the reproduction age @xmath3 ( not shown ) .",
    "the phase transition disappears and the only final state of the model is the dominant one for very large values of @xmath8 .      in the following the results of simulations with a language trait consisting of more than two languages are compared to the previous ones .",
    "the language ratio @xmath4 , the measure for a possible domination of one over the others , is now defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the most spoken language , @xmath5 the number of languages , and @xmath25 the number of agents speaking language @xmath26 .",
    "the simulations are carried out with @xmath27 and @xmath20 .",
    "we used @xmath28 for @xmath29 , respectively in order to keep the interaction per language constant .",
    "figure  [ fig : numwords]a compares the shape of the transition for different numbers of languages .",
    "the position of the critical point is shifted to smaller values of @xmath11 for more languages .",
    "this means that the more languages compete against each other , the lower is the possibility to have a scenario where one language dominates the other ones .",
    "figure  [ fig : numwords]b compares the same simulations carried out with the initial state where all agents speak language @xmath30 .",
    "the critical point is shifted to larger values of the mutation rate .",
    "this dependence of the final state on the initialization , leading to a hysteresis , shows that the phase transition is of first order . here the jump from one phase into the other is located at the intersection of the transition curve and the curve for the ratio of two languages",

    "the critical point moves to smaller values of the mutation rate for increasing @xmath5 .",

    "the transition shows a hysteresis for the simulations with more than two languages increasing with @xmath5.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    finally , we present a histogram of the hamming distances@xcite between all agents for simulations with 16 languages for different values of the mutation rate ( figure  [ fig : hamming ] ) .",
    "the parameters are the same as before .",
    "the hamming distance is defined by the number of bits by which the two bit  strings differ from each other . or , in other words , the number of bits which need to be changed to turn the language trait of an agent into that of the other one .",
    "figure  [ fig : hamming ] shows that the peak of the histogram of hamming distances turns from zero ( dominance ) to one ( no dominance ) at the critical point ( which here is located between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "in our model of language competition a phase transition similar to the one for the competition of different grammars in ref.@xcite and the one for the competition of languages of ref.@xcite is observed .",
    "nevertheless , working without fitness improvement for agents better adapted by their languages trait but with a sexual population with random mating makes the simulations useful to characterize current language competition .",
    "the phase of an uniform distribution of the languages ( fragmentation ) suggests a scenario where these languages compete equally against each other maintaining a stable state of coexistence . in the other state one language dominates clearly the other ones .",
    "the dependence of the phase transition point on the amount of language interaction as well as on the number of competing languages lets us make the following conclusions : there is no optimal value of maximum learning age for a language .",
    "its increase shifts the critical point to larger values of the mutation rate .",
    "thus a larger maximum learning age prevents the evolution of many languages where contact among speakers of different languages is strong .",
    "the model shows also that a larger number of different languages decreases the possibility of dominance of one of them and makes the transition jump higher .",
    "hence , the extinction of a language in a multilingual system can lead to a transition to the state where one language will begin to dominate all the other ones .",
    "the phase transition analyzed in the presented model is of first order for simulations with many languages as found in the model of ref.@xcite .",
    "the differences are that in our case , the transition is completely independent of the population size .",
    "we do not know if the simplification of a language to a single bit leads to this discrepancy or if it is the usage of a model with sexual reproduction .",
    "further analysis has to be done .",
    "the model brought insight into the mechanisms of language competition but still much has to be done .",
    "the results are similar to the ones of ref.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our model presents another approach to understand language competition .",
    "the design of an analytical model , for instance by diffusion equations similar to the ones used in ref.@xcite , without fitness would reveal if it is possible to obtain similar results with a mean field theory . the model presented in this paper can be extended by putting it on a lattice in order to investigate how the transition behaves with respect to a geographic distribution of languages .",
    "another extension would be the substitution of random mating by assortative mating@xcite , a concept used frequently in the theory of biological speciation , in order to give different priorities to monolingual parents and bilingual ones . in order to understand language invasion ,",
    "the model can be extended to include social structures .",
