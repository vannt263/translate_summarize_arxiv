    "much is already known about band structures of perfectly propagating waves in strictly periodic and relatively simple devices , and one of the current interests is the influence of random imperfections that are commonly present in real experiments .",
    "these imperfections are originated , for example , from the variations of the medium parameters such as the dielectric constant , magnetic permeability , barrier widths or heights @xcite .",
    "the analysis of scattering properties of periodic - on - average ( when periodic systems are slightly affected by a disorder ) models with various kinds of disorder is mainly related to numerical methods .",
    "it is obvious that giving important results for specific models and parameters , the numerical approaches can not serve as a guide for the understanding of generic properties caused by disorder . in this paper",
    "we try to fill this gap in the theory by the derivation of the localization length for the 1d kronig - penney model , relating it to the properties of transmission through a finite number of disordered barriers .",
    "our analytical results are compared with the experimental data obtained for a single - mode microwave guide .",
    "we show that in spite of the standard restrictions of analytical results ( restricted to infinite samples and weak disorder ) , comparison between theory and experiment is quite good .",
    "this fact is highly non - trivial since the experimental data are strongly influenced by absorbtion in the waveguide walls ; effect that is also not taken into account analytically .",
    "our study is relevant to other types of 1d stratified media , for example , to electron transport through random superlattices @xcite ( disordered arrays of semiconductor quantum wells / barriers ) or acoustic waves in random layered media @xcite .",
    "also , similar properties of the transmission are expected to occur in the 1d _ quantum _ kronig - penney model ( with alternating rectangular wells and barriers ) .    in sect .",

    "obviously this waveguide is not rectilinear ; in the experiment the teflon pieces and air segments are not perfect parallelepipeds : one side is longer than the other by 5 percent .",

    "this fact makes the profile of the first band ( see fig .  [",

    "we studied the effects of the uncorrelated positional disorder in the 1d kronig - penney model paying main attention to the transmission for weak , medium , and strong disorder .",
    "we compare experimental data obtained in the microwave kronig - penney setup with the direct calculations based on the transfer matrix method .",
    "we show that in spite of a very strong absorbtion in the metallic walls of waveguide , the experimental frequency dependence of the transmission is similar to that obtained numerically by neglecting the absorbtion effect . in particulary ,",
    "the position of the @xmath66 fabry - perot resonances , as well as the teflon resonances are in correspondence with numerical data . the structured similarity between experimental and numerical data",
    "can be explained by the different nature of the absorbtion in comparison with the resonance effects .",
    "namely , the latter are due coherent effects , in contrast with the non - coherent nature of the absorbtion .",
    "another part of our study is related to the expression for the localization length obtained in the perturbative approach for an infinite chain of scattering barriers .",
    "although in the experiment we have a relatively small number of 26 teflon barriers , we show that the expression for the localization length can be effectively used for the description of the transmission coefficient through the finite sample of barriers . to do this",
    ", we have used the relation between the transmission coefficient and localization length that involves the finite size of samples , and applied it to the experimental situation . as a result",
    ", we have found that the analytical expression for the transmission coefficient reproduces quite well the frequency dependence of experimentally obtained data .",
    "note again , that the global correspondence between analytical and experimental results occurs in the presence of strong absorbtion that is non - avoidable experimentally .",
    "the observed correspondence between experimental and analytical results indicate that the expression for the localization length is a working quantity for finite samples , a fact that is not commonly used in applications .",
    "the method we used to derive the expression for the localization length can be generalized to a more general case of the correlated disorder @xcite , for which anomalous effects in the transmission are predicted and experimentally observed .",
    "our results can be applied to photonic crystals and electron superlattices , as well as to propagation of acoustic waves in disordered systems .",
