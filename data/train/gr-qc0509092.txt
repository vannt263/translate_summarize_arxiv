    "the choice of suitable coordinate conditions has certainly played a major role in the understanding of solutions of einstein equations at the analytical level . from the early well posedness result by choquet - bruhat @xcite to recent global existence proofs",
    "@xcite a judicious choice of coordinates was key to yielding a tractable problem .    at the numerical level , coordinates play even a more crucial role as an unfortunate choice might render the simulation useless despite much computational effort .",
    "in fact , the optimal situation is one where coordinates not only behave well ( i.e. not forming coordinate singularities ) but also aid in the simulation .",
    "the latter refers to a choice of coordinates that adapts to the problem at hand , making evident ( possibly approximate ) symmetries that might be present .",
    "a testimony of the importance of this subject has been the number of works that have been devoted to it . from the early works of york and smarr",
    "@xcite which proposed coordinate conditions through elliptic equations , to more recent works which present alternatives to choosing coordinates that could aid in the numerical simulation ( see for instance @xcite ) considerable efforts have been invested towards defining useful coordinate conditions . in general , these conditions seek to minimize suitably defined quantities with the hope that these will , in turn , have a positive impact in the behavior of numerically evolved quantities .",
    "the proposed coordinate conditions are usually given in algebraic terms or through elliptic equations .",
    "the latter is expected when conditions requiring stationarity of variables whose evolution is determined by hyperbolic equations are imposed .",
    "when attempting to use such conditions , one faces the problem of dealing with a hyperbolic - elliptic system of equations which require appropriate boundary conditions . until recently ,",
    "convenient boundary conditions for the main variables in spacetimes involving black holes were not sufficiently understood for generic situations when singularity excision was used .",
    "the complications associated with properly defining the elliptic side of the problem at the analytical level coupled to the additional `` extra cost '' that solving these equations during the evolution has spurred a number of efforts aiming to circumvent both these issues .",
    "the idea has been to promote the elliptic equations to hyperbolic ones through `` driver equations '' @xcite .",
    "these conditions aim to sidestep the cost issue and the need to impose boundary conditions at possible excision surfaces .",
    "conditions based on this strategy have been employed in a number of works yielding much improved evolutions , most notably in bssn codes where specific coordinate conditions are obtained by requiring the time variation of the ( trace of the ) connection variables be driven to zero ( the so - called @xmath0-driver ) .",
    "the hyperbolicity analysis of the bssn system with the @xmath1 conditions augmented by suitable advection terms has been presented in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the system is strongly hyperbolic in this case , though unfortunately these augmented coordinate conditions do not necessarily freeze the @xmath0 variables .",
    "it is then unclear wether these augmented conditions will have the same impact as the original ones in simulations and also if they share similar hyperbolicity properties .",
    "therefore , there are a number of questions that remain open , namely ( i ) what is the true impact of adopting these ` driver ' conditions on the hyperbolic properties of the complete ( main variables plus gauge ) system ?",
    "( ii ) furthermore , are the conditions obtained sufficiently flexible to guarantee desirable properties such as to yield a convenient characteristic structure at boundaries ? ( iii ) how must one extend the knowledge gained in the `` @xmath0-freezing conditions '' so as these can be thought as truly geometric expressions not tied to particular variables in the system and hence useful to other formulations ?",
    "( iv ) what is the freedom in the implementation of these conditions and their behavior in actual applications ?    in the present work , we examine these questions both in the theoretical and practical senses in order to draw conclusions applicable to most metric based formulations of einstein equations by considering coordinate conditions motivated from possible geometrical constructions . in particular , we concentrate on conditions defined either at a given hypersurface ( and its embedding on the four - dimensional spacetime ) , or at the four - dimensional spacetime level . the former results into a set of elliptic equations which contains the well known minimal distortion / strain condition for the shift vector and the maximal conditions for the lapse while the latter gives hyperbolic equations related , in a sense , to the harmonic coordinates .    with these conditions ,",
    "we analyze the properties of the whole system of equations ( coordinate conditions plus einstein equations ) where in the case of implementing the elliptic equations we promote them to hyperbolic ones via the `` driver '' approach .",
    "additionally , we investigate possible difficulties that can be encountered when employing these coordinate conditions in conjunction with an excision strategy .",
    "our analysis mainly concerns 3 + 1 _ metric formulations_. that is , those based on the intrinsic metric and extrinsic curvature of spacelike hypersurfaces defined by a foliation of the spacetime .",
    "the equations governing the future evolution of these variables are derived from the einstein equations in the spacetime of interest and are augmented by additional variables and check whether that the resulting system , coupled to the coordinate conditions , is at least strongly hyperbolic .",
    "as we will see , in all cases one obtains a system with a characteristic structure such that its eigenvectors couple gauge / coordinate variables to the main variables .",
    "this has strong implications for the system , since :    * in the cases where singularity excision is to be used , the characteristics of the system must be such that they are completely outflow towards the excision boundary .",
    "this condition is fulfilled when , roughly @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 the projection of the shift along the spacelike unit normal to the excision surface @xmath4 and @xmath5 the lapse function ) .",
    "since now the coordinate conditions are dynamical , extra care must be taken to monitor that it is fulfilled .",
    "* since the characteristic modes of the system now mix coordinate and main variables , if the condition above is not satisfied , it is extremely difficult to provide boundary conditions to the gauge functions consistently .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case where the elliptic conditions themselves are employed . here",
    "boundary conditions for the gauge variables could be imposed so as to guarantee the outflow requirement is satisfied .",
    "unfortunately , as we will describe in section iii , commonly used conditions fail to satisfy some important desirable conditions which might have strong implications in numerical implementations .",
    "we point out how this can be avoided and the cost associated in doing so .",
    "additionally , we analyze alternative conditions derived from considering approximate symmetries in the spacetime .",
    "this condition , called `` harmonic almost - killing equation '' coupled to einstein equations gives rise to a well behaved system where coordinates respond to ( approximate ) symmetries .",
    "we present simulations to investigate their usefulness within standard numerical relativity testbeds .    in order to carry out several analysis presented in this work ,",
    "it is necessary to adopt a given formulation of the equations . to this end",
    "we consider the strongly hyperbolic formulation presented in @xcite and the so - called z4 formulation .",
    "the former can be regarded as an ` augmented ' adm formulation with the addition of first order variables keeping the metric s gradient and suitable combination of constraints to the right hand sides .",
    "the latter is basically a covariant extension of the einstein field equations , obtained by introducing a new four vector @xmath6 which is defined by its evolution equations .",
    "this way , the symmetrized covariant derivatives of this four vector are added to the einstein equations , that is @xmath7 the solutions of the einstein 's solutions are recovered from the extended set when @xmath6 happens to be a killing vector , that is @xmath8 for a generic spacetime , this happens just in the trivial case @xmath9 , so true einstein s solutions can be easily recognized .",
    "before presenting different possibilities for adopting coordinates we comment on what are arguably useful properties they should satisfy . there exist several discussions on what constitute requirements for good coordinate conditions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; these are based on the intuitive picture that useful coordinates , from the point of view of a numerical implementation , should :    * be free of artificial ( coordinate ) singularities ; * take advantage of existing symmetries in the problem , whether approximate or exact .",
    "in particular if the spacetime is stationary , coordinate conditions should give rise to metric components explicitly time independent ; * in the absence of symmetries , they should minimize the rate of change of either the metric or other appropriately defined geometrical quantities ; * be 3-covariantly defined if possible ( i.e. independent of coordinate changes within a given hypersurface ) .",
    "the points above are important at a fundamental level in that they are hopefully satisfied irrespective of the formulation used or the particular problem under study . to these",
    ", further requirements might be added that refer more to specific applications like coordinates having :    * suitable behavior near singularities .",
    "for instance , conditions yielding a convenient slicing of the spacetime .",
    "this could range from those that avoid the singularities altogether ( like singularity avoiding conditions ) to those that penetrate the possible horizon ( in the case where excision techniques are to be applied ) . in the latter case , it important that the resulting characteristic structure be such that all variables are outflowing towards the excision region .",
    "* appropriate asymptotic behavior so that extraction of physically relevant quantities is facilitated and/or , related coordinate speeds are bounded so as to not have to deal with superluminal cases .",
    "finally , the conditions adopted must be such that within the formulation of einstein equations employed the well posedness of the underlying problem to be treated is guaranteed as the choice of coordinates is not decoupled from the issue of defining a well posed problem .",
    "for instance , the adm formulation with analytically prescribed coordinate ( lapse and shift ) conditions is weakly hyperbolic ( hence yielding an ill - posed problem ) while with harmonic coordinates is symmetric hyperbolic . for a more general discussion of hyperbolic formulations",
    "see for instance @xcite .    as mentioned , one of the main motivations when choosing coordinate conditions is that they should not introduce spurious `` dynamics '' in the evolution of the system .",
    "this motivation has lead throughout the years to the introduction of different conditions . when attempting to define such conditions an obvious difficulty is the need to do so in an three - covariant way so as to decouple coordinate effects to the true physical behavior of the spacetime .",
    "a way to do so was introduced by smarr and york @xcite by constructing scalar quantities from the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of the spacetime and minimizing their variation with respect to the lapse function and shift vector .",
    "for instance , the ` strain ' scalar defined in analogy with fluid dynamics , is defined as @xmath10 which can be used to construct a positive definite lagrangian @xmath11 this geometrical object is used to construct a ( non - negative ) action which measures the distortion or strain of a given hypersurface . by minimizing this action with respect to the shift @xmath12 , @xmath13 an elliptic equation ( called  minimal strain \" ) is obtained for the shift .",
    "when this equation is fulfilled , the rate of change of a suitable norm of the spatial metric will be minimized from one hypersurface to the next one .",
    "the minimal strain equation can be generalized by considering the action of the densitized metric @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) , obtaining this way what we will call the  minimal densitized strain \" .",
    "this equation can be written simply as @xmath16 = \\nabla_k [ \\nabla^i \\beta^k + \\nabla^k \\beta^i                                          - 2~\\lambda \\gamma^{ki } \\nabla_m   \\beta^m              - 2~\\alpha~(k^{ij } - \\lambda \\gamma^{ki } trk ) ] = 0\\ ] ] so the minimal strain condition reduces to the choice @xmath17 .",
    "another interesting case , called  minimal distortion \" ( in analogy with a related notion of elasticity ) is recovered for the choice @xmath18 .",
    "these ( elliptic ) equations seem natural conditions for the shift in numerical relativity applications , since they satisfy the fundamental properties mentioned earlier .",
    "notice that one could have also opted to minimize the action with respect to the lapse @xmath5 .",
    "this yields an algebraic condition for it @xcite , though it is ill - defined for time - symmetric cases .",
    "an alternative strategy is to consider minimizing an scalar defined by @xmath19 with respect to the lapse .",
    "this provides a fourth - order elliptic equation for it @xcite .",
    "we will refrain from considering it here as it will introduce further complications either at the computational cost level ( if implementing the elliptic equation ) or at a conceptual level when promoting the equation to a hyperbolic condition .    as mentioned , when considering these conditions within an initial boundary value problem , assessing the well posedness becomes more involved as the system becomes of elliptic - hyperbolic nature .",
    "this , in particular , means the solution will strongly depend on the boundary data specified . until recently ,",
    "the lack of a well defined strategy to specify inner boundary conditions ( say in the case where black hole excision is adopted ) , coupled to the extra cost associated with solving elliptic equations numerical induced considerable activity towards employing related conditions within a purely hyperbolic problem . for these reasons , it has become customary to define associated hyperbolic equations to implement related conditions .",
    "parabolic conditions could also be considered , but they certainly would not simplify the cost issue ( as their courant - friedrich - levy condition scales quadratically with the grid - spacing , and can be further regarded as an inefficient method to solve the elliptic equation itself via relaxation techniques ) .",
    "we will thus concentrate on hyperbolic conditions and analyze the implications they carry .",
    "we will restrict our analysis to a large family of hyperbolic coordinate conditions .",
    "some of these are derived by simple relations that have been employed in the past while others are motivated by the minimization of geometrical quantities as described above . in this latter case , we follow recent works @xcite , in that we will approach the problem here by adopting hyperbolic driver conditions to implement the equations .",
    "however , as opposed to these works , we will require that the coordinate conditions analyzed do indeed minimize the desired elliptic equations .",
    "that is , we will neither assume that considering other related equations having the same principal part but differing in the lower order terms will yield similarly behaved coordinates nor that suitable lower order terms can be added so as to obtain first order conditions .",
    "although these assumptions can be , and have been , adopted in previous works , the conditions thus obtained are not guaranteed to satisfy the original sought - after geometrically motivated conditions .    to be specific , we will consider conditions that can be written as @xmath20 for suitably defined @xmath21 which we regard as the gauge conditions .",
    "these will be given by either algebraic or differential equations relating the q - quantities with the other variables of the system , trying to fulfill as many of the desired requirements described in the previous section as possible .    in what follows",
    "we consider separately three distinct cases which refer to the way the fields @xmath22 are defined .",
    "we distinguish cases with the name ` algebraic ' when @xmath23 or @xmath24 are directly defined , ` differential ' when they obey evolution equations and ` semi - algebraic ' in cases where an algebraic for one and a differential for the other is considered .",
    "one of the simplest choices is an algebraic relation between the q - quantities @xmath25 and the main variables of the system . in this definition",
    "are included the general gauge conditions proposed recently in @xcite and the subfamilies discussed in many other works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the prototype of algebraic gauge conditions is given by the harmonic coordinates , which were introduced half a century ago to ensure the well posedness of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this is obvious as in this case , the principal part of einstein equations for all components reduce to @xmath26    although the well posedness of the cauchy problem is ensured this way for the evolution system , this coordinate choice does not fulfill  a priori \" many of the properties of an ideal gauge condition in the absence of suitably defined sources or lower order terms . in particular , the freezing of the metric components in ( almost ) stationary spacetimes is by no means guaranteed .",
    "another delicate issue is that the shift so - defined is not a three - vector and so need not reflect the symmetries in the problem .",
    "this can be seen more clearly by translating the harmonic coordinates condition to the 3 + 1 decomposition language : @xmath27 the @xmath24 will not transform as a vector ( except under linear transformations ) , so neither @xmath24 nor @xmath12 will be vectorial quantities during the evolution",
    ".      we will refer to as semialgebraic gauge conditions those that , keeping an algebraic relation for @xmath23 , allow for a differential definition of the @xmath24 .",
    "this way there is enough freedom to fix the shift with an exact geometric condition .",
    "naturally , one could have done the opposite , i.e. an algebraic relation to @xmath28 while a differential one for @xmath23 since the former is what is most commonly used in current applications and elliptic conditions for the lapse , that minimize the rate of change of the extrinsic curvature , is fourth - order we will concentrate on algebraic / differential conditions for the lapse / shift .    for the lapse we propose a generalization of the harmonic coordinates which includes the bona - masso lapse condition @xcite and its slight modification presented in @xcite , that can be written as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is added when considering the z4 formulation of einstein equations , otherwise this term must be dropped .",
    "the generalization consists on having added the parameter @xmath31 to the above equations which determines wether the advection terms are included ( @xmath32 ) or not ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the `` lapse speed '' ( ie , the speed of the eigenvectors associated to the lapse ) will be fixed by this parameter in combination with the free function @xmath34 .",
    "notice also that the subfamily @xmath32 reduces to several well studied cases depending on the expression for @xmath35 : @xmath36 is the geodesic slicing , @xmath37 is the time harmonic slicing , @xmath38 is the  1+log \" and so on .",
    "additionally , the subfamily @xmath33 has been used successfully in the evolution of single bh @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind this generalization is that , as we will see later , the characteristic structure of the coordinate conditions adopted will have delicate , profound , differences depending on the values these parameters take .",
    "in addition to this generalization for the lapse condition , we consider a similar one to the shift condition which we will define by a suitable hyperbolic driver which seeks to satisfy the minimal distortion condition .",
    "we next revise how this condition is to be defined and further generalize it to include related options .",
    "an elliptic condition can be imposed in a dynamical way through a parabolic or hyperbolic `` evolution '' equation .",
    "the former can be regarded as a standard relaxation way to obtain the solution of the elliptic equation while the latter drives the solution towards the desired one , in analogy with a damped oscillator .",
    "the first approach was used in @xcite to convert the minimal distortion elliptic equations into time - dependent parabolic equations by means of the hamilton - jacobi method , that is , @xmath39 \\ , .\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath40 is characteristic of all the drivers , and determines the dissipation strength employed so that the solutions of the elliptic and the parabolic equations agree . for small values of @xmath40 ,",
    "the shift is expected to tend slowly to the elliptic solution . at this point",
    "it is worth noticing that in the fully dynamical case , it is not completely clear that equation ( [ parabolicdriver ] ) is actually a driver .",
    "the procedure is inspired in simple elliptic equations , like for instance the laplace equation @xmath41 . in this simple case",
    "the hamilton - jacobi method indeed provides a driver to the elliptic equation . in the case of einstein equations however , this conclusion is not immediate as the equations are highly coupled . in a `` frozen variables '' approximation , where all main variables are regarded as fixed , the driver condition does give rise to a solution satisfying the elliptic equations ( up to suitable boundary conditions ) . in general , however , assessing this behavior is considerably more delicate .",
    "nevertheless , current simulations indicate at least for the cases considered that the hyperbolic - driver conditions do give rise to reasonably well behaved solutions @xcite as judged by monitoring the approximate fulfillment of the original elliptic condition that motivated the driver condition .",
    "these simulations implement a driver in such a way that some of the variables of the bssn formalisms @xcite , the @xmath42 , are frozen at late times in black hole evolutions . although they give rise to great improvement in the evolution of single black holes an head - on collisions , it is not clear whether they are successful due to the fact that they minimize particularly delicate variables in the system @xcite or due to their `` proximity '' ( in a loose sense ) to a minimal distortion condition .",
    "if the latter is the reason , it would indicate that this condition could benefit other formulations .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , these conditions have been employed in practical applications only in the bssn - based codes .    in order to investigate the usefulness of the geometrically motivated condition we consider",
    "it within the driver approach generalized in the following way ( q3 equation ) :",
    "@xmath43 = -\\sigma~ q^i \\ , .\\ ] ] let us discuss in detail the differences between the standard gamma driver condition , as used in @xcite , and ( [ q3 ] ) .",
    "first , a lie term has been included in the q3 equation with a free constant @xmath44 .",
    "although this lie term does not come naturally from the  driver \" , we will see later that it affects the shift speed ( that is , the speed of the eigenvectors associated to the shift ) and it will be required in order to fulfill other requirements .",
    "the physical meaning , when @xmath45 , would be that the driver is not along the time lines but along the normal lines to the space - like hypersurfaces .",
    "the second difference is that we employ a covariant derivative ( with respect to the intrinsic metric of the hypersurface ) in ( [ q3 ] ) which is dictated by the minimal distortion condition .",
    "this additionally ensures the tensorial character of the equation , and so both the @xmath24 and the @xmath12 are now vectors , with the corresponding advantages .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath46 has been kept in order to generalize the condition and adapt it to other formalisms that do not use the conformal decomposition .",
    "this way , it one can choose which densitized strain is going to be minimized during the evolution .      in order to analyze the structure of the system with the coordinate conditions adopted we must choose a particular formulation . here",
    "we employ the z4 formalism though we have checked that similar issues arise when employing the above coordinate conditions in the formulation presented in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic analysis of the gauge conditions ( [ bmlapse ] , [ q3 ] ) with the z4 formalism described in the next section shows that there are three clearly separated `` gauge cones '' .",
    "we refer to them in this way to stress that these come about due to the coordinate conditions considered . however , their corresponding eigenvectors span _ not just _ the part of the hilbert space corresponding to the lapse , shift and derivatives of this last one .",
    "indeed , they have components both on the coordinates and main variables sectors which will have delicate consequences as we shall see later .",
    "these gauge cones can be grouped into three distinct entities :    * lapse cone , which propagates with speed @xmath47 .",
    "* transversal shift cone , which propagates with speed @xmath48 .",
    "* longitudinal shift cone , which propagates with speed @xmath49 .",
    "an analysis of the associated eigenvectors both for the z4 and the formalism described in @xcite reveals that the full evolution system is strongly hyperbolic only if all the gauge speeds are different one from each other and different from the speed of light .",
    "otherwise , there is a collapse of some of the eigenvalues and there is not a complete basis of eigenvectors , leading to a weakly hyperbolic system .    we thus see the need to introduce the lie terms ( controlled with the parameters @xmath50 ) in equations ( [ bmlapse ] , [ q3 ] ) which will provide sufficient flexibility to obtain a well behaved system . for simplicity ,",
    "let us focus on the condition for the lapse the same discussion is also valid for the other gauge cones. if the lie term is included ( @xmath32 ) , as the driver acts to minimize the dynamics along the normal line , the associated speeds are @xmath51 .",
    "this kind of structure allows for inflow coordinates where @xmath52 and all the lapse eigenvectors have negative speed .",
    "as mentioned , this requirement is crucial near a black hole horizon , where a standard practice is to excise the singularity by introducing an excision boundary .",
    "here it is not known which boundary conditions to define and even how could be implemented if known  .",
    "another problem of this approach is the existence of so - called `` sonic points '' ( in analogy with fluid dynamics ) where the speed is zero ( @xmath53 ) . at these points",
    "there is a collapse of some of the gauge eigenvectors with some standing modes , and the system is weakly hyperbolic in one direction .    on the other side ,",
    "if the lie term is not included ( @xmath33 ) , the lapse speeds are @xmath54 . in this case",
    "the driver is along the time lines and the evolution system is always strongly hyperbolic ; the speeds / eigenspeeeds are such that only in the case @xmath55 there could be a collapse of eigenvectors .",
    "however , some of these eigenspeeds are such that , at an excision surface , will always describe incoming modes ( i.e. towards the computational domain ) .",
    "this means that boundary conditions are to be specified for these modes somehow .",
    "unfortunately , as these modes couple coordinate and main evolution variables , one has to worry about how to provide suitable boundary conditions to the gauge functions and carry the evolution of the main variables without providing boundary conditions to them .",
    "this is a delicate problem in itself .",
    "intuitively , one expects that boundary conditions are only required for the gauge functions ; however , some of the main variables themselves depend on the gauge functions also ( the extrinsic curvature ) .",
    "hence , the issue of separating the gauge dependent component of the incoming modes must be clarified before proceeding this way .",
    "to do so requires considering constraint preserving boundary conditions which might be further complicated by the fact that the characteristic structure need not be constant along the excision surface .",
    "summarizing , there is a tension between trying to obtain a minimizing prescription and ensure both strong hyperbolicity of the system and that any suitably defined excision boundary is of outflow type . in hindsight it could be argued that this is a consequence of having tried to ` get away ' without solving an elliptic equation which does require boundary conditions at all boundaries and solely deal with a hyperbolic equation where no boundary is required at the excision surface .",
    "it is then clear that the options are : ( i ) to stay at the elliptic ( or related parabolic ) level for the coordinate conditions ; ( ii ) give up the symmetry seeking approach through driver conditions ( at least in the problematic regions by suitably modifying the equations or by adding convenient lower order terms to the equations @xcite ) or ( iii ) consider a new set of options that aim to resolve the conflicts .",
    "an appealing alternative is to consider conditions derived by minimizing some suitably defined spacetime scalars . as it has been recently pointed out in @xcite , the harmonic almost - killing equation ( hake ) @xmath56 = 0\\ ] ] is a generalization of the killing equation @xmath57 whose solution space includes also the affine killing vectors and , of course , its subfamily the homothetic killing vectors .",
    "for this reason , the covariant conservation law ( [ hake ] ) can provide a precise definition of the concept of approximate killing vectors as solutions of the hake equation ( [ hake ] ) .",
    "this equation can be obtained from the standard variational principle ( [ variational ] ) with a lagrangian @xmath58 given by @xmath59 since the lagrangian is non positive it is not possible to guarantee that extremizing the action will provide a solution that minimizes it . however , by suitably adding damping terms , the hope is that will indeed be the case .",
    "in such a case , the hake equation can be of great utility as a coordinate condition , because it is not only well adapted to the stationary spacetimes ( a killing vectors is a solution ) but also  minimizes \" the deviation from the stationary regime . in spacetimes with some ( quasi ) symmetry , it is expected that the congruence of time lines of the observers will be aligned during the evolution with the time ( almost ) killing vector , avoiding this way spurious time dependence due to an unfortunate choice of coordinates .",
    "the physical meaning can be better understood by considering the adapted coordinates @xmath60 , where now @xmath61 .",
    "the 4d lagrangian ( [ lagrangianq4 ] ) can be written as @xmath62 which can be reinterpreted as a four - dimensional generalization of the positive definite 3d lagrangian ( [ lagrangian3d ] ) . following the analogy , the hake equation ( [ hake ] )",
    "can be seen as the 4d generalization of the minimal densitized strain ( [ minimalstrain ] ) .",
    "the main difference is that , since the hake equation considers also the time component of the spacetime , the structure of the resulting system is not elliptic anymore but hyperbolic .    in the z4 context",
    "there are z - terms that must be included in the hake ( [ hake ] ) in order to get a well posed problem . with these terms , the conservation law ( [ hake ] ) can be written in different ways , like for instance @xmath63 =   2~g^{\\mu \\nu}~{\\cal l}_{\\xi } z_\\nu ~~,\\ ] ] or , in adapted coordinates , @xmath64 equation ( [ hake1 ] ) shows explicitly the tensorial character of the gauge condition , while the equation ( [ hake2 ] ) points out its relation with the harmonic coordinates , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "this gauge condition , which will be called q4 , is the closest to fulfill all the requirements ; not only the shift but also the lapse is well adapted to stationary spacetimes , and if there is only an approximated symmetry , the coordinates are expected to adapt in order to minimize the rate of change of the metric .",
    "an additional property is that as a result of their construction , the gauge conditions obtained are also defined in a covariant way .",
    "the ambiguity of including or not the lie terms in the q - equations , introduced in the q3 gauge , is not present here , where there is no choice : the lie terms are actually there . as a consequence",
    ", the lack of strong hyperbolicity at sonic points appears again in the gauge cones , as it will be shown in the next section .",
    "in order to study the hyperbolicity of the gauge conditions we have to consider them within the context of a specific formalism in order to get a closed set of equations that will constitute the evolution system .",
    "for concreteness we adopt the z4 formalism , but similar results can be obtained with other formulations .    here the z4 formalism and the q4 gauge will be written down as an evolution system of ( second order in space and first order in time ) equations by means of the 3 + 1 decomposition .",
    "the characteristic structure of a fully first order version of this evolution system will be analyzed in detail , as well as how to pass from a second order system ( in space ) to a first order one without altering the structure of the eigenvectors .",
    "the four - dimensional equations ( [ z4 ] ) can be written , by using the 3 + 1 decomposition , in the equivalent form @xcite : @xmath66 \\\\ \\label{dttheta } ( \\partial_t -{\\cal l}_{\\beta})~\\theta & = & \\frac{\\alpha}{2}~   [ r + 2~ \\nabla_k z^k + ( trk - 2~ \\theta)~ trk   -tr(k^2 )   - 2~ z^k { \\alpha}_k/ \\alpha - 2~\\tau ] \\\\ \\label{dtz }   ( \\partial_t -{\\cal l}_{\\beta})~z_i & = & \\alpha~ [ \\nabla_j~({k_i}^j    -{\\delta_i}^j \\ , trk ) + \\partial_i \\theta   - 2~ { k_i}^j~ z_j   -   \\theta~ { { \\alpha}_i/ \\alpha } - s_i ] \\:\\:\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to convert the equations ( [ dtgamma]-[dtz ] ) into a fully first order system , the spatial derivatives of the lapse , the shift and the intrinsic metric must be introduced as new independent quantities , that is @xmath67 and substituted everywhere .",

    "this provides a less restrictive alternative gauge condition for more general situations .",
    "finally , some numerical experiments have been performed in order to check the properties of the q4 gauge , the condition which appears as the most promising one within generic hyperbolic conditions derived in a geometrical way .",
