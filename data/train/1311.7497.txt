    "phase - referencing in interferometry is a technique which uses the phase information in the interference signal of a reference object to correct the phase of the signal from a target object for path length fluctuations in the atmosphere .",
    "the target can either be the same or a nearby object .",
    "this technique has been widely used in radio interferometry but its potential in optical long baseline interferometry was only realized in the early 1990s @xcite .",
    "this technique is mainly used ( 1 ) to extend the effective atmospheric coherence time beyond the limit imposed by atmospheric turbulence in order to increase the sensitivity of an interferometer @xcite and ( 2 ) to measure the phase difference between the target and the reference signal in order to determine the relative position of the target object in the sky @xcite .    unlike radio interferometry where phase - referencing can be achieved by rapidly slewing the antenna back and forth between the target object and the reference , in optical interferometry both objects",
    "must be observed simultaneously because the atmospheric coherence time scale is measured in milliseconds .",
    "therefore , phase - referencing optical interferometers usually have two beam combiners to record interference signals from two objects at the same time .",
    "a dual beam combiner for an optical interferometer is analogous to an adaptive optics ( ao ) instrument for a single mirror imaging telescope .",
    "the first dual beam combiner setup for an optical long baseline interferometer was installed at the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) .",
    "the beam combiners operated in the near ir wavelengths ( k  band ) and were designed to perform phase - referenced narrow - angle astrometry @xcite .    with similar scientific motivation ,",
    "a second beam combiner was recently installed at the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) @xcite .",
    "the new setup at susi aims to perform phase - referenced narrow - angle astrometry as a mean to search for extra - solar planets around bright close binary stars . despite the similar goal",
    ", the implementation of the dual beam combiner configuration at susi as compared to pti is vastly different .",
    "the beam combiners at susi operate at visible wavelengths ( 0.770.9@xmath1 m ) and are unconventional in that they perform dual - star phase - referencing in post - processing .",
    "this offers the beam combiners at susi the potential of measuring the relative position of a target object about three times more precisely at the same baseline at a cost of tighter tolerances , and a method to perform real time group - delay tracking at much lower bandwidth .",
    "the achievable astrometric precision , which is limited by the phase uncertainty of the interference signal , is proportional to the mean wavelength of the signal obtained with the beam combiners .",
    "a shorter wavelength translates to a higher astrometric precision .",
    "the mean wavelength in which the beam combiners in susi are operating at is @xmath23@xmath3 of k  band ( i.e.  @xmath22.2@xmath1 m ) .",
    "for this same reason , the phase information of the reference signal must be accurately known to a fraction of the mean wavelength ( i.e.  a tighter tolerance with shorter wavelength ) so that the phase uncertainty of interference signal of the target object as a result of the phase - referencing process is small and the visibility of the fringe packet is not lost due to incoherent integration .",
    "the optical setup of the beam combiners at susi is described in the following section .",
    "then , the approach to phase - referencing via a network of metrology systems and the details of the data processing required are discussed in sec .",

    "susi is a 2-element optical long baseline interferometer located near narrabri , new south wales , australia .",
    "[ fig : opt_olbi ] shows a schematic diagram of such an interferometer .",
    "starlight collected from 2 siderostats ( labeled as apertures in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_olbi ] ) are reflected by a series of mirrors into one or more light combining instruments .",
    "susi has a configurable ( 5160 m ) north - south oriented baseline ( distance between 2 siderostats , commonly denoted as @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) .",
    "it was completed in 1991 and for over two decades , the subsystem instruments within the interferometer , especially the beam combiners , have been constantly upgraded to increase its sensitivity and capability @xcite .",
    "the current main beam combiner in susi is the precision astronomical visible observation ( pavo ) instrument @xcite which has been operating since 2009 and has been used mainly for stellar diameter measurements and astrometry of binary stars @xcite .",
    "joining it is the recently installed microarcsecond university of sydney companion astrometry ( musca ) beam combiner instrument .",
    "musca is designed to operate alongside pavo for high precision narrow - angle astrometry .    , defines the separation between the 2 light collecting elements of the interferometer while the unit vector @xmath6 ( commonly known as the pointing vector ) describes the angle between a star of interest and the baseline .",
    "the optical path length of each delay line is denoted by the symbol @xmath7 .",
    "interference fringes are formed when the opd between the delay lines is @xmath8.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the two beam combiners are fed with a pair of starlight beams from the two arms of the interferometer but they each use a slightly different part of the visible light spectrum .",
    "they share the same main delay line for the tracking of their interference signals in the form of interference fringes which are only visible when the optical path difference ( opd ) between the two arms of the interferometer is near zero ( within the coherence length of the starlight whose range of wavelengths are usually defined by a bandpass filter ) .",
    "such interference signal is usually known as a fringe packet ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : opt_strategy ] for examples ) .",
    "the main delay line is made up of 2 folded optical paths , one for each arm .",
    "both paths , represented by the structures labeled ` delay line # 1 ' and ` delay line # 2 ' in fig .  [ fig : opt_olbi ] , are simultaneously controlled to differentially add optical path to one arm and remove the same amount from the other .",
    "detail description of the main delay line is given by @xcite .",
    "in addition , musca has a differential delay line ( ddl ) for switching between fringe packets of two stars in a binary system .",
    "the ddl is needed because the optical path modulation used to sweep through a fringe packet in musca is often smaller than the typical optical path length between peaks of the envelope of the fringe packets of two stars in a binary system .",
    "the limit of the optical path modulation is illustrated by the width of the rectangular window around each fringe packet in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_strategy ] while the fringe packet separation , which is the main observable of the pavo+musca dual beam combiner configuration , is represented by the dimension @xmath9 in the figure .",
    "suppose the phase delay of a fringe packet , denoted by the symbol @xmath10 or @xmath11 , is defined as the opd between two arms of the interferometer computed at the mid - range of the optical path modulation in musca , then a measurement of the displacement of the ddl , denoted by the symbol @xmath12 , and the difference in phase delay between the pair of stellar fringe packets yield the fringe packet separation , @xmath9 .",
    "the relation between @xmath9 and the on - sky separation of the two stars is given as , @xmath13 where @xmath14 or @xmath15 is a unit vector that describes the angle between a star and the baseline of the interferometer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : opt_olbi ] ) .    during observations ,",
    "pavo is used as a group - delay tracker to keep the fringe packet of a star within the modulation range of optical path in musca .",
    "then in post - processing , pavo and a network of interferometer - based metrology systems are used to estimate the opd at each optical path modulation step in the musca .",
    "pavo observes only one reference fringe packet ( usually the one of the primary star in a binary system ) throughout an observation session but musca alternately observes either one of the two fringe packets by toggling the position of the ddl every 515 minutes depending on the atmospheric seeing conditions .",
    "the relative position of the fringe packets is measured simultaneously but indirectly because as pavo tracks the reference ( primary ) fringe packet musca observes the secondary .",
    "the reference phase of the reference fringe packet is assumed to be stable over time .",
    "the stability of the reference fringe packet is evaluated and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs_calibrators ] . with a typical integration time of 1015 minutes on the fringe packets ( during dual - star phase - referencing mode ) , the astrometric precision due to anisoplanatism of the atmospheric turbulence @xcite for star separation of @xmath161@xmath17 is negligible ( @xmath1610@xmath1as ) as compared to the reference phase stability ( refer to sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] for detail discussion ) .",
    "this assumes a baseline of @xmath1860 m is used and the atmospheric scaling factor at susi is @xmath2780m@xmath19s@xmath20arcsec .",
    "pavo is a multi - axially aligned fizeau - type interferometer , but unlike a typical fizeau interferometer , pavo forms spatially modulated interference fringes in a pupil plane and then spectrally disperses the fringes .",
    "it also employs spatial filtering in its image plane and an array of cylindrical lenslets to utilize the full multi - r@xmath21 aperture of the siderostats at susi . a similar setup @xcite is operational at the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_sch ] shows the schematic diagram of the pavo beam combiner .",
    "the actual optical setup is divided into two parts : a front - end and a back - end arrangement .",
    "the front - end optics splits the incoming beams into various components while the back - end optics ( fig .  [ fig : opt_pavo_sch ] ) recombines the beams .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current ] shows the overall arrangement of the pavo optics .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current](b ) also shows the location of the metrology sources which are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : metrology ] .",
    "the north ( n ) and south ( s ) beams from the siderostats propagate from the left to right in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current](a ) .",
    "a pair of dichroic filters , nd1 and sd1 , separate the tip - tilt from the science beams .",
    "the filters reflect light of wavelength shorter than 0.54@xmath1 m and transmit light of longer wavelengths .",
    "the reflected blue end of the visible spectrum is fed into a tip - tilt system which acts as a first order ao system that removes the tip and tilt components ( or the phase ramp ) from the wavefront .",
    "the science beams are then separated by wavelength into 2 parts , one for pavo and another for musca , by another pair of dichroic filters , n16 and s16 .",
    "these filters reflect light of wavelength shorter than 0.79@xmath1 m and transmit light of longer wavelengths . as a consequence ,",
    "the middle part of the visible spectrum ( 0.540.79@xmath1 m ) is reflected into pavo while the red end of the spectrum is transmitted into musca .",
    "the beams are actually converging ( @xmath22/700 ) because there is a focusing lens in each arm of the interferometer ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current ] ) which focuses to an image plane located at the pavo two - hole mask .",
    "each of the @xmath21.2 mm apertures in the mask corresponds to a fov of @xmath22@xmath17 on the sky .",
    "the holes are separated by twice their width and are used as low - pass spatial filters to clean aberrated images of stars .",
    "a knife - edge mirror is used to align the beams through the apertures of the mask .",
    "the beams are aligned at the pupil plane to form spatially modulated fringes .",
    "fringes are formed in the pupil plane so that they are less sensitive to seeing and misalignment . at the pupil plane ,",
    "different parts of the combined pupil are sampled by an array of lenslets that act as virtual slits across the image plane for a spectrograph .",
    "the spectrograph , which consists of a bk7 prism and a pair of six - element 50 mm lenses , spectrally disperses the fringes before they are re - imaged onto an emccd camera .",
    "more in - depth description of pavo at susi can be found in several other papers @xcite .",
    "musca is a pupil - plane michelson interferometer which operates at wavelengths between 0.77@xmath1 m and 0.91@xmath1 m .",
    "it forms temporal fringes by modulating the optical path length of one arm with time .",
    "[ fig : opt_musca ] shows the optical path and components of musca .",
    "incoming converging light beams from the top of the figure continue from fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current](a ) .",
    "the beams are combined co - axially at the beam - splitter , bs .",
    "a scanning mirror n18 m is used to modulate the optical path length of the north arm of musca .",
    "it is attached to a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) which converts voltage to physical displacement .",
    "voltage is applied in small steps and at an interval of about 0.20.3ms per step . in order to avoid excitation of unnecessary mechanical resonance",
    "the modulation signal is passed through a 1ms low - pass rc filter before it is fed to the transducer .",
    "the intensity variation of the combined beams as a result of the optical path length modulation is recorded as temporal fringes using a pair of spcm - aqr-14-fc self - contained single photon counting avalanche photodiode ( apd ) modules from perkinelmer .",
    "the maximum path length modulation attainable from the transducer is @xmath2140@xmath1 m ( maximum throw of the pzt is @xmath2100@xmath1 m in a folded optical path ) but the typical value used for musca is @xmath225@xmath1 m .",
    "this is chosen for musca because ( 1 ) it matches with the pavo s group delay tracking window and ( 2 ) it is approximately 2@xmath3 larger than the expected width of the musca fringe packet .",
    "making the range larger is undesirable because the pavo group delay estimates are unreliable beyond its tracking window and therefore phase - referencing is futile at that range .    a linear translational stage ( t - ls28 from zaber technologies ) and two mirrors on the south arm of musca form the ddl for the beam combiner .",
    "it is used for fringe finding by equalizing the optical path length between the north and south arms . the fiducial location where opd between the arms is defined to be zero",
    "is chosen at the middle of the scan range of the scanning mirror .",
    "as fringe packets from two different stars are separated in optical path length the ddl must alternate between two positions in order to place either one of the fringe packets into the scan window .",
    "effectively the ddl is used to ` select ' one fringe packet for observation at any one time .",
    "the stage is stepper - motor driven and has a built - in open loop position control system .",
    "the stepper motor converts rotary motion into linear motion via a leadscrew .",
    "the total travel distance of the stage is more than 8 mm , which is the required span to observe binary star separations as wide as 10@xmath17 using a 160 m baseline . at an average slew speed of @xmath22mm / s ,",
    "it takes the stage less than 5 seconds to cover that distance .",
    "the leadscrew - based open loop position control system of the stage , which has a nominal accuracy of 12@xmath1 m and a repeatability of @xmath160.4@xmath1 m , is not the only mechanism put in place to measure the position of the stage for musca s astrometric application .",
    "it is also being measured by a dual laser metrology system which has a precision better than 5 nm .",
    "the metrology system works hand in hand with the open loop position control system and is discussed in detail in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the role of each field lens , ln4 and ls4 ( @xmath23=35 mm ) is to ensure that the pupil of any off - axis star ( in musca s case , the secondary of a binary system ) is formed within the active ( photo - sensitive ) region of an apd .",
    "otherwise musca will not be able to detect fringes from stars further than 0.2@xmath17 from the on - axis reference star .",
    "the ir cut - off filters in front of each apd are intended to reduce the number of background photon counts originating from an ir metrology laser ( @xmath24 1.152591@xmath1 m ) which is used with the main delay line at susi .",
    "the filter cut - off wavelength is about 1@xmath1 m .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]      alignment light sources in susi can be divided into two sets according to their function .",
    "the first set consists of a laser and a bright halogen lamp and is used for general optical alignment and internal fringe searching .",
    "they are injected into the optical path in front of pavo ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current](b ) ) through a pin hole and a pellicle .",
    "the second set consists of leds and is used to align the narrow - angle baseline of musca with the wide - angle baseline of susi .",
    "the leds are attached precisely in the center of the back of the mirror mount at every siderostat .",
    "the alignment process takes advantage of the imperfection in the dichroic filter fabrication , e.g.  the finite slope of the filter profile at the cut - off wavelengths , to reflect light back into the beam combiners .",
    "pavo uses its emccd camera for optical alignment but musca uses a separate ccd camera specifically for the same purpose . in order to use the latter ,",
    "a prism is slid into the optical path during alignment and is removed during observation .",
    "the wide - angle baseline of an interferometer is defined as a vector between pivot points of two siderostats .",
    "the pivot point of a siderostat is a virtual point where the two rotational ( elevation and azimuth ) axes of the siderostat intersect and typically coincides with the center of the siderostat mirror .",
    "the wide - angle baseline vector is obtained by observing stars separated by large angles and located in various parts of the sky , noting the differences between the expected and the actual optical delays ( offsets ) required to produce stellar fringes based on a set of estimated dimensions and finally solving the simultaneous equations of offsets to obtain a correction to the estimated baseline vector initially used .",
    "the uncertainty of the wide - angle baseline obtained with this method is in the regime of several micrometers in principle , and @xmath2100@xmath1 m for susi once all errors are taken into account .",
    "the baseline vector only needs to be updated on a time - scale of the order of a few weeks if the accuracy of its value is to remain better than 50@xmath1 m @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the narrow - angle baseline of the same interferometer ( also known as the imaging baseline according to a definition by @xcite ) is defined as a vector between the center of two entrance pupils of a beam combiner projected onto the siderostats .",
    "the following is an example to easily understand the relation between the wide- and narrow - angle baselines .",
    "suppose a two - hole aperture - mask is put over each siderostat mirror , fringes from each pair of apertures ( one from each siderostat ) can be used to make astrometric measurements of a binary star on a slightly different narrow - angle baseline simultaneously , despite the aperture pairs between the two masks share the same pivot points , which defines the wide - angle baseline of the two interferometers .",
    "if the wide- and narrow - angle baselines are not co - aligned , then using the wide - angle baseline solution for narrow - angle astrometry of a close binary star system is erroneous which then systematically limits the precision of the astrometric measurement . in order to achieve a precision of 10@xmath1as",
    ", the co - alignment between the two baselines must be better than 1 mm per 100 m baseline for a binary separation of @xmath181@xmath17 .",
    "the effect of baseline uncertainty on the astrometric precision of the measurement has been extensively discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the image of an led at a siderostat formed on the musca camera has a diameter of about 12 pixels , where @xmath21 camera pixel in the image plane corresponds to a dimension of 1 mm at the siderostats .",
    "therefore , in order to meet the baseline uncertainty requirement , the centroid of the led images from the north and south siderostats must be aligned to within 1 pixel .",
    "the centroid of an led image is computed by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian model to the image in real time while mirrors are being adjusted for alignment . at the same time , the led images are also aligned to the fiducial center of the tip - tilt system so that the tip - tilt beams have the same optical axis as the musca science beams .",
    "this alignment procedure is carried out every night before an astrometric observation with pavo and musca commences .",
    "there are 4 metrology systems in susi which are designed to measure the opd of different parts of the interferometer .",
    "the main metrology is a double laser homodyne interferometer and operates at an ir wavelength of 1.152591@xmath1 m with a single acousto - optic modulator shifting the reference beam by 40 mhz .",
    "it is used to measure the opd introduced by the main delay line in susi .",
    "the metrology feeds pavo with measurements of the displacement of the main delay line so that pavo can track stellar fringes in a closed servo loop by driving the main delay line to compensate any fringe motion during observation . since a detailed description of this metrology system in its original design",
    "was given by @xcite and later by @xcite after the system underwent a recent upgrade , it will not be discussed further in this paper .",
    "the remaining three metrology systems are newly installed and used for phase - referenced narrow - angle astrometric observations .",
    "other than additional light sources , which consist partly of those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current](b ) , the metrology systems do not require any extra hardware or optical components .",
    "the systems are made up of a white - light ( wl ) metrology , a single laser ( sl ) metrology and a dual laser ( dl ) metrology system .",
    "together , they form a two - prong approach to measuring the optical path length between fringe packets of two stars in a binary system . first , the wl and the sl metrology systems are used to measure the opd of every optical path non - common to pavo and musca .",
    "the objective is to ensure that any change in the position of a musca phase - referenced fringe packet is caused by the ddl within the beam combiner .",
    "second , the dl metrology system is used to measure the displacement of the ddl .        a schematic diagram showing the optical paths of susi is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : met_susisch ] .",
    "the labels in bold in the figure represent the different parts of susi .",
    "the labels in regular type font are optical components which can be cross - referenced back to fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_pavo_current ] and [ fig : opt_musca ] .",
    "the non - common paths between pavo and musca are labeled as * p * and * m * in fig .  [ fig : met_susisch ] . in the first prong of the approach",
    ", the phase delays of interference signals in musca , @xmath25 , are estimated using the phase delays of interference signals measured by pavo , @xmath26 , and the opds of the non - common paths measured by the metrology systems .",
    "this is given as , @xmath27 where , @xmath28 and the subscripts in the equations represent different parts of the susi optical paths as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : met_susisch ] .",
    "then in the second prong of the approach , the true phase delay difference between two musca fringe packets , @xmath9 , is estimated by correcting the apparent phase delay difference with the change in the opd within musca , @xmath29opd@xmath30 .",
    "this is given as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the phase delay of either fringe packet .",
    "in this paper , the phase delay of an interference signal is defined as the opd between two arms of an interferometer computed at a fiducial location and is usually quoted in units of @xmath1 m .",
    "the fiducial location for musca is in the middle of the scan range of the scanning mirror .",
    "similarly , the fiducial location for pavo is in the center of the fov of the emccd camera .",
    "the fiducial locations for computing the remaining opd terms in eq .   and are not important because they are not measured independently .",
    "the light source for this metrology system is an led which emits light at a peak wavelength of @xmath33 m .",
    "it is injected into the susi optical path in front of pavo with a pellicle beam - splitter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : opt_pavo_current](b ) ) .",
    "it then propagates to a pair of retro - reflecting mirrors , nac and sac , and back to pavo .",
    "this optical setup constitutes a fizeau interferometer .",
    "less than 5% of the total light from the led is reflected into musca because the dichroic mirrors ( n16 and s16 ) are only highly reflective at wavelengths shorter than 0.79@xmath1 m .",
    "this has negligible effect on the phase - referencing performance of pavo and musca .",
    "the optical path of the metrology is coaxially aligned with the incoming starlight path in order to minimize the non - common path error in the measurement .",
    "the interference fringes formed by the led are recorded simultaneously with the stellar fringes during observation with the same pavo camera for the same purpose .",
    "the lower quantum efficiency of the camera at the metrology wavelength ( @xmath225 - 30% ) enables pavo to observe fringes of a star and the metrology simultaneously .",
    "suppose @xmath34 represents the phase delay of the fringes formed by this metrology , then @xmath34 is the sum of opds along the propagation path of the metrology , i.e. , @xmath35 however , the phase measurement is modulo of 2@xmath36 .",
    "therefore the non - ambiguity range ( nar ) of the metrology is equal to one wavelength of the led light . despite the short nar ,",
    "the range is adequate because fringes are recorded by the pavo camera at a rate of one frame per @xmath375ms and the opd measured by @xmath34 is not expected to change by more than one wavelength within this time interval .    over longer timescales ,",
    "the range of opd variation measured by @xmath34 can exceed one wavelength of light over a timescale of several hours depending on the laboratory seeing .",
    "this is not a concern because the pavo spectrograph disperses the metrology fringes into narrow bands so that the coherence length of the fringe packet is @xmath3730@xmath1 m .",
    "the sum of opd@xmath38 and opd@xmath39 is not expected to vary beyond 30@xmath1 m in one night as there are no moving parts along the optical path .",
    "the wl metrology measures only the relative opd .",
    "the reference opd is taken to be the opd at the start of an observation session .",
    "the value is near to zero ( within @xmath4010@xmath1 m approximately ) .",
    "the absolute value of the reference opd is not important nor does it need to be precisely at zero because it will be cancelled out in the data analysis .",
    "the major source of noise in the phase delay measurement is photon noise because the led is relatively bright as seen with the pavo s low read noise emccd camera .",
    "the estimated measurement uncertainty is 80 nm or less , but this value does not translate directly into astrometric error because the error in determining the relative position of the phase - referenced fringe packet is averaged over many musca scans , which reduces the error by a factor of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of good scans used in the integration",
    ". it does however affect the overall integration time because more scans are required to average out larger uncertainties .",
    "the light source for this metrology system is a green he - ne laser which emits light at a peak wavelength of @xmath43 = 0.5435161@xmath1 m .",
    "this laser also serves a dual purpose for optical alignment .",
    "the metrology laser is injected into the susi optical path the same way as the led but it propagates via the pair of retro - reflecting nac and sac mirrors and into the musca beam combiner .",
    "the intensity of the metrology laser is controlled by the selection of neutral density filters at the source ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : opt_pavo_current](b ) ) so that it does not ` blind ' the apds when observing faint stars .",
    "this optical setup constitutes a mach - zehnder interferometer .    like the wl metrology , the optical path of the sl metrology is also coaxially aligned with the starlight path in order to minimize the non - common path error in the measurement . for the same reason ,",
    "the interference fringes formed by the laser at the musca beam - splitter are recorded by the musca apds simultaneously with the stellar fringes during observation .",
    "suppose @xmath44 represents the phase delay of the fringes formed by this metrology , then the opd probed by @xmath44 is , @xmath45 although the phase measurement is modulo of 2@xmath36 , the nar is adequate because the scanning mirror makes an up and down scan ( one period ) per 150ms and the opd measured by @xmath44 is not expected to change by more than one laser wavelength within this time interval . over longer timescales , when laboratory conditions are unstable , the opd variation measured by @xmath44 can exceed one laser wavelength over a timescale of several hours , but is still negligible compared to the coherence length of the laser .    the sl metrology measures",
    "only the relative opd between the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "the opd measured at the start of an observation session is set as the reference opd .",
    "it is also not necessary for the reference opd to be precisely zero although it is usually set to near zero ( within @xmath405@xmath1 m approximately ) before the start of an observation .",
    "the absolute value of the reference opd is not important because it will be cancelled out in the data analysis .",
    "similar to the wl metrology , the measurement uncertainty of @xmath44 does not translate directly into astrometric error .",
    "the light sources for this metrology system are green and red he - ne lasers .",
    "the former is the same green laser used for the sl metrology .",

    "since the two observations were 3.9 days apart , this consistency is also supported by the orbital period of the eclipsing binary ( 5.7 days ) which suggests the photo center of the primary component could be on opposite sides of the uniform disk on the two nights of observation . on the other hand , the binary separations in the right ascension axis ( @xmath164 ) measured on the two different nights differ by more than 10mas .",
    "this discrepancy can not be an effect of the orbital motion of the secondary component ( ab ) around the primary ( aa ) because the estimated orbital period for the pair is 201 years @xcite and the estimated motion within @xmath24 days is @xmath1730.1mas .",
    "it is also unlikely to be an effect of narrow - angle baseline misalignment because in order to produce the astrometric uncertainty ( @xmath210mas over @xmath2260mas of projected separation ) obtained from the data analysis the east - west component of the narrow - angle baseline on the two nights must differ by @xmath230 cm , a dimension which is larger than the diameter of the main siderostat mirror .",
