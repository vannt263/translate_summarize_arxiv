    "it is well known that the standard model ( sm ) admits some `` accidental '' symmetries such as the separate conservation of baryon ( @xmath1 ) and lepton ( @xmath2 ) number . in other words ,",

    "the phenomenological signatures of an unstable lsp have been investigated extensively in a variety of papers , both at lepton @xcite and hadron @xcite colliders .",
    "generally the signatures are the consequences of new interaction terms that arise in the superpotential or in the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking part of the lagrangian when the assumption of r - parity is lifted .",
    "wide attention has been given to extracting bounds on these new couplings from precision tests of the standard model and from cosmological constraints .",
    "the extent of the literature on the subject is daunting : we refer the reader to ref . @xcite and references therein for a comprehensive review .    given the impact that a precise determination of the coupling size has on the phenomenological consequences , we think it is important to obtain them in the greatest possible generality .",

    "since r - parity violating terms are neither forbidden by gauge invariance nor by renormalizability , but rather depend on phenomenological consistency , one can wonder to what extent r - parity could be broken , i.e. how big are the couplings appearing in eqs .",

    "the limits in the literature are obtained under the assumption that a single coupling dominates the r - parity violating contributions to a process ( scd ) .",
    "this assumption rests on the premise that some hierarchy exists between the leptonic , semileptonic and hadronic couplings , or between different fermionic families .",
    "besides , the couplings often enter as sums of squares , so that one might guess the most conservative bounds follow from this hypothesis .",
    "we found that in most cases this is not so .",
    "it is an open question whether such a hierarchy does indeed exist . in the absence of a theoretical guide",
    ", we apply a `` multi - parameter '' approach to placing bounds , to explore new regions of parameter space . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we give examples of our approach and contrast the results to those of the scd simplification .",
    "we think it is important at this point to clarify our notation , as the originality of our contribution rests in making explicit use of some properties of @xmath0-couplings that are often overlooked in the literature , partly because the established notation bears some elements of ambiguity . as far as scd is concerned",
    ", the concept was originally formulated by dimopoulos and hall @xcite .",
    "as generally applied , one assumes that a single coupling ( or a single product of couplings ) is much larger than the others which , therefore , can be neglected when placing bounds . as is the case in most of the corrections to the sm that involve r - parity violating couplings , more than one coupling is present and often this simultaneous presence is not clear in the notation .",
    "for example , when the process at hand involves the four - fermion interactions described by eqs .",
    "( [ eff_lagr_sl ] ) and ( [ eff_lagr_l ] ) , the initial and final states of the scattering or decay are supposed to be completely known , whereas the exchanged sparticle , whether a squark or a slepton , can be of any generation . thus",
    ", since this flavor is unknown , one has always to sum over the families of the sparticles compatible with the relevant vertices .",
    "so , it is important to understand that a bound that reads , for example , @xmath51 can be taken to mean either @xmath52 for each @xmath53 , or @xmath54 as in eqs .",
    "( [ notation4a ] ) and ( [ notation4b ] ) , we adopt the standard 100 gev scaling of sfermion masses throughout .",
    "one of the ways of implementing the scd convention consists in setting all but one @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ notation4b ] ) to zero , thus effectively obtaining eq .",
    "( [ notation4a ] ) .",
    "the strong version produces bounds that are obviously more conservative than the weak one , so we will display the form ( [ notation4a ] ) every time we place a new bound on a coupling , with the caveat that the reader can interpret it in the form of eq .",
    "( [ notation4b ] ) .",
    "we will state explicitly when we make an exception to this rule .",
    "if the initial and final states of the four - fermion process involve the same vertices , the r - breaking couplings enter the process only through their modulus squared .",
    "in the literature it is then customary to express the corrections to the sm as functions of simplified quantities : @xmath56 ( but also @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) or @xmath59 ( but also @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) . in light of what we have explained above ,",
    "we want to make clear that these are symbols that stand in full for : @xmath62 where the scaling factor @xmath63 comes from the general form , eq .",
    "( [ flav - cons_lagr ] ) .",
    "thus , they admit a sum over the flavors of the exchanged sfermion @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) which , depending on the case , can be a slepton ( @xmath67 ) or a squark ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "it is also clear that the value of the mass of the exchanged sparticle is always left unknown .",
    "if , instead , the susy process involves different vertices , then the correction to the standard model is expressed as a function of a product of couplings , of the kind @xmath69 ( equivalently , @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) . in these cases too , a sum over @xmath72 needs to be considered .",
    "analyses that return one product as dominant are a common extension of the scd .",
    "we have decided to label the fermion ( sfermion ) generations by a number index @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 or @xmath72 ) @xmath73 whenever the families are summed over , as in eqs .",
    "( [ notation4b ] ) and ( [ rijk ] ) , or when one of the indices is free to take any values , as in eq .",
    "( [ notation4a ] ) .",
    "but , for clarity s sake , if the bound involves just one single particular coupling we will label the generation by name so that , for example , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and so on .",
    "we have mentioned above that implementation ( [ notation4a ] ) of the scd produces bounds that are more conservative . in most cases ,",
    "though , a physical process can not be expressed in terms of only one combination of couplings such as ( [ rijk ] ) .",
    "the bounds from experiment are placed generally on a function of combinations @xmath77 it is a common approach in the literature to set all the @xmath35 s of eq .",
    "( [ notation ] ) but one to zero , so as to place bounds on the surviving combination of couplings .",
    "moreover , one term at a time of the combination is then assumed to dominate .",
    "it is this particular implementation of the scd that we find excessively severe , as it reduces the dimensionality of the allowed regions of parameter space thus missing any information on the combined action of different couplings embedded in the function @xmath78 . in the next two sections",
    "we show that allowing the full dependence on @xmath78 does indeed give more information and in some cases also extends the allowed bounds on the couplings .",
    "in order to show how our approach works , we start with some classical examples in the leptonic case @xcite . we begin with constraints required by universality in muon and tau decays , then take up the constraints from @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 elastic scattering cross section measurements .",
    "let us consider the two following ratios : @xmath82 and @xmath83 which are sensitive to violation of lepton universality . by comparing the tree - level effective lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eff_lagr_l ] ) with the sm , one can derive bounds on some of the @xmath23-couplings .",

    "<S> this allows us to explore new regions of parameter space and to relax a number of bounds given in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we look for qualitatively different results compared to those obtained previously using the assumption that a single coupling dominates the r - parity violating contributions to a process ( scd ) . by combining results from several experiments , </S>",
    "<S> we identify regions in parameter space where two or more parameters approach their maximally allowed values . in the same vein , </S>",
    "<S> we show a circumstance where consistency between independent bounds on the same combinations of trilinear coupling parameters implies mass constraints among slepton or squark masses . though our new bounds are in most cases weaker than the scd bounds , the largest deviations we find on individual parameters are factors of two , thus indicating that a conservative , order of magnitude bound on an individual coupling is reliably estimated by making the scd assumption . </S>"
