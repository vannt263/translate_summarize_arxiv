    "the fluctuations at the interface between two fluid phases at thermodynamic equilibrium have been studied very extensively starting from the beginning of this century @xcite , and particular investigation has concerned those at the interfaces of critical fluids @xcite . although the features of equilibrium interfacial fluctuations are now relatively well known , the behavior of an interface under nonequilibrium conditions is still not well understood .",
    "many experiments have been performed to detect an effective nonequilibrium surface tension in miscible fluids @xcite but the results obtained are mainly qualitative .    in this paper",
    "we will present experimental results about the behavior of interfacial fluctuations during the diffusive remixing of partially miscible phases . in this system",
    "the interface between two fluid phases is being crossed by a macroscopic mass flow .",
    "it is well known that the fluctuations in the equilibrium states before and after the diffusive partial remixing are controlled by surface tension and gravity .",
    "it is not clear , however , what happens to the interface during the remixing : does the interface temporarily dissolve ? is there a surface tension during the transient , and how is it related to the evolving macroscopic state ?",
    "we try to address these problems by means of low - angle light scattering measurements of the correlation function of fluctuations .",
    "+ the sample considered is a near critical binary mixture kept below its critical temperature t@xmath0 , so that it is macroscopically separated into two bulk phases by a sharp horizontal interface .",
    "the diffusive remixing is started by raising the temperature to a value closer to t@xmath0 , but still below it .",
    "+ we report data at equilibrium showing the expected interface capillary waves , and data obtained out of equilibrium during partial diffusive remixing , showing for the first time that capillary waves at the interface are still present and coexist with `` giant '' nonequilibrium fluctuations in the bulk . by combining time - resolved measurements with predictions for the light scattered by the fluctuations , we are in the position to derive data for the time evolution of the nonequilibrium surface tension .",
    "these data show for the first time that during the diffusive remixing the surface tension attains almost instantaneously its final equilibrium value , and this is consistent with a fast rearrangement of the concentration profile in the neighborhood of the interface .",
    "traditionally , interfacial fluctuations have been studied by means of dynamic surface light scattering techniques @xcite .",
    "these techniques allow to determine the power spectrum of the light scattered from the excitations , and have been used very extensively to characterize the equilibrium properties of interfacial fluctuations in simple fluids and binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "surface light scattering is usually performed by sending a probe beam on the interface at the angle of total reflection , scattered light being collected around the specular reflection angle and partially recombined with the main beam , so that a heterodyne signal is obtained .",
    "however , dynamic scattering techniques are not very well suited to study time - dependent nonequilibrium processes , as the time needed to accumulate an adequate statistics of the fluctuations is often much longer than the time related to changes in the macroscopic state of the fluid . to bypass this problem",
    "we have used a unique low - angle static light scattering setup . although the fluctuations timescales are not accessible with this instrument , it allows to determine in a fraction of a second the static light scattered at 31 wavevectors distributed within a two decades range , making it a very useful tool to study fluctuations around a time - dependent macroscopic state .",
    "this instrument , described in detail elsewhere @xcite , typically investigates a wavevector range corresponding to @xmath1 . + our setup",
    "is configured to detect the transmitted static scattered intensity , the probe beam being sent vertically at normal incidence . in this way light is scattered both at the interface and in the bulk layers above and below it .",
    "it can be easily shown that the structure factor in the transmission geometry is proportional to the usual one in reflection . +",
    "a critical binary mixture is an ideal sample to study the nonequilibrium fluctuations during diffusion at an interface .",
    "although other partially miscible fluids could be used to perform this experiment , the use of a critical mixture allows to tune the timescale of the macroscopic diffusion process by adjusting the temperature difference from the critical point .",
    "moreover experimental runs can be iterated simply by cycling the temperature .",
    "+ the sample is a 4.5  mm thick horizontal layer of the binary mixture aniline ",
    "cyclohexane prepared at its critical consolution concentration ( c=0.47  w / w aniline ) .",
    "its critical temperature t@xmath0 is about 30@xmath2c , and was determined to within @xmath30.01@xmath2c before each experimental run . while slowly decreasing the temperature of the single phase above t@xmath0 , t@xmath0 was taken as the temperature where a sudden increase of turbidity was observed .",
    "+ the light scattering cell is a modification of the rayleigh - bnard one already used to investigate fluctuations in a thermal diffusion process @xcite , configured to keep the sample at a uniform temperature . the mixture is sandwiched between two massive sapphire windows whose temperature control , achieved with peltier plates , is as good as 3mk over a period of one week , temperature differences between the two plates being kept to about 2mk . +",
    "a typical measurement sequence involves the following procedure .",
    "an optical background is recorded with the mixture in its one phase region at 5.5  k above t@xmath0 , where the bulk fluctuations amplitude is many orders of magnitude smaller than the one of equilibrium and nonequilibrium fluctuations in our experiment .",
    "this optical background mostly contains contributions due to dust and imperfections of the optical elements , and it is subtracted to all subsequent measurements .",
    "the system is then let phase separate at 3.5k below t@xmath0 , where the concentration difference between the two bulk phases is @xmath4@xcite .",
    "great care is dedicated to eliminate wetting drops at the optical windows .",
    "after a few hours the intensity distribution scattered by the system at thermodynamic equilibrium is recorded , scattered light being mostly due to the capillary waves at the interface . the nonequilibrium process",
    "is then started by suddenly increasing the temperature at 0.1@xmath2c below t@xmath0 .",
    "the concentration difference between the phases has to readjust by means of a diffusive process .",
    "the two macroscopic phases at this temperature are not completely miscible . at equilibrium",
    "they will have concentration difference of @xmath5@xcite and they will be separated by a new interface . the scattered intensity distribution is recorded during this transient , until the system reaches thermodynamic equilibrium after about 24  hours .",
    "it is well known that the interfacial fluctuations at the equilibrium states preceding and following the diffusion process are overdamped capillary waves @xcite , characterized by a @xmath6 power spectrum which exhibits a gravitational stabilization at small wavevectors .",
    "the main problem we want to address is how the fluctuations behave during the transient between the equilibrium states .",
    "the evolution of the scattered intensity distributions can be roughly divided into two stages . in the first stage , represented in fig .  1 , the intensity distribution , initially due to the equilibrium interface excitations , increases and develops a bump , which represents the appearance of a typical lengthscale",
    ". the initial data set , being the least intense , is particularly affected by the subtraction of the optical background .",
    "the time elapsed during this stage roughly corresponds to the thermal time needed to increase the temperature of the sample ( about 200  s ) . in the second stage , represented in fig .  2 , the intensity distribution decreases , until eventually the bump disappears , and the @xmath6 equilibrium power spectrum of capillary waves is recovered .",
    "notice that light scattered at large wavevectors does not change with time during this stage .",
    "we will see that this is related to the readjustment of the concentration profile across the interface having taken place . + to analyze our data we assume that the sample may be depicted as the superposition of two thick bulk layers separated by a thin interface layer , and that these layers scatter light independently from each other .",
    "therefore we are considering two sources of scattering , the interface fluctuations scattering @xmath7 and the fluctuations in the bulk phases scattering @xmath8 , so that the total intensity distribution is : @xmath9 where , as outlined in the appendix , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in eqs .",
    "( [ dis2 ] ) and ( [ dis3 ] ) , @xmath12 is the wavevector of light in vacuum , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the mixture s refraction index , weight - fraction concentration and density , respectively .",

    "( [ qro ] ) @xmath25 represents the largest concentration gradient in the bulk phases at a certain time @xcite .",
    "we use eqs .",
    "( [ dis1])-([dis3 ] ) to fit the experimental data shown in figs .",
    "in order to limit the number of fitting parameters we take advantage of the fact that the concentration difference @xmath26 across the whole sample does not change during the so called free - diffusive regime @xcite , as the diffusive remixing initially involves only layers of fluid close to the interface . therefore @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are related by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the time required for diffusion to occur over the sample height @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is of the order of  7000s for our sample , by assuming d=@xmath33 ( this is the equilibrium value at 3k below t@xmath0 , see @xcite and references therein ) . by imposing the reference value @xmath34 @xcite and by fitting the experimental data using eqs .",
    "( [ dis1])-([dis3 ] ) , we are able to determine three parameters : the concentration difference across the interface and the rolloff wavevectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 . +    results for @xmath19 are presented in fig .",
    "3(a ) as a function of time .    initially @xmath19 has its equilibrium value @xmath35 .",
    "after about 40  seconds from the temperature increase it begins to drop , and decreases for about 300s , finally stabilizing to the constant value @xmath36 .",
    "this is roughly a factor of two larger than the reference equilibrium value @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the difficulty ( both theoretical and in the fitting procedure ) of clearly ascribing the measured scattered intensity to either interface or bulk phases , and an estimate of our rather large fitting and systematic error is shown with the error bars in fig .",
    "this error is such that our data can not be considered fully quantitative , but it does not affect the features we discuss . + by combining the results for @xmath19 and @xmath21 , since from eq .",
    "( [ qcap ] ) @xmath37 we are in the unique position to obtain the time evolution of the interfacial surface tension during the nonequilibrium process .",
    "experimental results for the surface tension are shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , which represents the main accomplishment of this work .",
    "the two crosses mark the value of the equilibrium surface tension at the initial and final temperature , extrapolated from the reference data from atack and rice @xcite .",
    "the first data point represents the equilibrium surface tension measured with our light scattering setup .",
    "the agreement with the reference value is good .",
    "after the diffusion process is started the surface tension drops about two orders of magnitude , until after about 300s it stabilizes to a constant value .",
    "the asymptotic value of the surface tension is about a factor of two larger than the reference value , a good result considering the wide range of values spanned .",
    "although these results are only partially quantitative , fig .",
    "3 unambiguously shows for the first time that the properties of the nonequilibrium interface rapidly attain their equilibrium values .",
    "this equilibration time is very small compared with the one associated to readjustments of the bulk phases ( which corresponds to about one day ) , and it is comparable to the time needed to increase the temperature of the sample . notice that the surface tension evolution does not show the initial delay seen on the @xmath19 evolution .",
    "this indicates that the surface tension is probably following the local temperature almost instantly , whereas @xmath19 does not change until diffusion has occurred over the fluctuations characteristic lenghtscales . with the diffusion coefficient given above this time",
    "is about 30s for the smallest wavevectors observed .",
    "+ we are now in the position to comment the fast growth , shown in fig .  1 , of the scattered intensity distributions at intermediate and large wavevectors .",
    "soon after the diffusion process is started the concentration difference across the interface decreases at its equilibrium value . according to the concentration conservation eq .",
    "( [ dis4 ] ) , a strong concentration difference @xmath38 is rapidly created in the bulk phases , and a large concentration gradient quickly grows near the interface .",
    "this gives rise to velocity - induced concentration fluctuations described by eq .",
    "( [ dis3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the growth of @xmath39 during the free diffusive regime is shown by the circles in fig .  4 , and it mirrors the results for @xmath40 in fig .",
    "when enough time has passed for diffusing particles to reach the macroscopic boundaries ( about 5000s as from fig .",
    "4 ) , the sample enters the restricted diffusion regime , where the total concentration difference across the sample begins to change , and eq .",
    "( [ dis4 ] ) does not hold any more .",
    "however , according to fig .  3 , we can now assume that the interfacial parameters have attained their asymptotic values .",
    "in this way we can fit the scattered intensity distributions to determine the concentration difference across the bulk phases .",
    "results for @xmath38 obtained in this way are shown by the squares in fig .",
    "the evolution of this process is very similar to that already observed during the free diffusion of completely miscible phases @xcite . from the fitting of the nonequilibrium bulk data we also determine the rolloff wavevector @xmath22 , which corresponds to the bump observed in the light scattering data in figures  1 - 2 . as outlined above and",
    "thoroughly described in ref.@xcite , fluctuations at wavevectors smaller than @xmath22 are stabilized by gravity , which frustrates the @xmath41 divergence at small wavevectors .",
    "the rolloff wavevector is plotted in fig .  5 as a function of time .",
    "the results displayed in fig .  5 show that the variation of @xmath22 roughly corresponds to a factor of  1.4 .",
    "@xmath22 is mostly determined by the layers of fluid where the concentration gradient is largest @xcite , that is the bulk layers close to the interface . from eq .",
    "( [ qro ] ) , we can estimate that the variation of the concentration gradient close to the interface is rather small , roughly corresponding to a factor four .",
    "this behavior suggests that the bulk concentration gradient is pinned to the interface concentration profile .",
    "we have reported light - scattering measurements of the correlation function of fluctuations at the interface and in the bulk phases of a critical binary mixture undergoing diffusive partial remixing . from the intensity distributions",
    "it is clear that even during remixing a sharp interface separates the two bulk phases , and that this interface is roughened by capillary waves similar to those at equilibrium .",
    "our data have been analyzed , yielding qualitative information on the concentration profile of the system .",
    "in particular our main results are the time evolution of the interface concentration difference and the surface tension , showing how these parameters relax to the final equilibrium values quickly compared to the system s macroscopic equilibration time .",
