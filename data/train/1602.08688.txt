    "to quantize a classical quantity , regularization procedures are often adopted . however ,",
    "in general , different regularizations lead to different operators , and hence the so - called quantum ambiguities arise . in loop quantum gravity ( lqg )",
    "( see @xcite for review articles , and @xcite for books ) , on one hand , the flux @xmath0 , as a classical basic variable of lqg , corresponds directly to the standard momentum operator . on the other hand",
    ", it can also be regularized as an alternative operator using the cotriad operator @xmath1 corresponding to the integration of cotriad @xmath2 over a one - dimensional segment @xmath3 .",
    "a celebrated result is that the standard and the alternative flux operators share the same properties , and they may become the same operator in a suitable setting @xcite .",
    "as the cotriad operator enters the construction of the hamiltonian constraint operator by thiemann s trick and provides lqg a well - defined quantum dynamics @xcite , the consistency check on the two flux operators enhances the confidence in the regularization procedure by using the cotriad operator as a building block to construct the quantum dynamics . in order to obtain the on - shell anomaly - free quantum constraint algebra , one has to employ degenerate triangulation at the coplanar vertices of spin networks in the regularization procedure of thiemann s hamiltonian .",
    "this problem has been overcome by a new proposed hamiltonian constraint operator in @xcite . in the general case of matter fields",
    "coupled to gravity , an inverse volume operator enters into the construction of the matter hamiltonian operator @xcite . in order to obtain also the on - shell anomaly - free quantum constraint algebra for the coupling system , the degenerate triangulation at coplanar vertices",
    "is still needed according to the treatment in @xcite for the original inverse volume operator .",
    "on the other hand , the inverse volume corresponds to the inverse scale factor in the isotropic cosmological model . in loop quantum cosmological models , the inverse scale factor operator is bounded above @xcite .",
    "this property is sometimes used to understand the big bang singularity resolution by loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is argued in @xcite that the boundedness of the inverse scale factor operator in lqc is not maintained by the inverse volume operator in lqg .    in this paper , the cotriad operator is used to construct new alternative volume and inverse volume operators .",
    "the graphical method introduced in @xcite brings much convenience to study the properties of these two operators in detail ( see also @xcite for the graphical method based on tempereley - lieb algebra ) .",
    "the new alternative volume operator shares the same properties with the standard volume operator in lqg @xcite . in the concrete , it is internal gauge invariant , diffeomorphism covariant , and symmetric .",
    "its action on spin - network states leaves the spins @xmath4 invariant but changes the intertwiners @xmath5 .",
    "it does not act at coplanar vertices or gauge - invariant trivalent vertices .",
    "the new alternative inverse volume operator is also possessed of the above properties .",
    "thus we can employ this new inverse volume operator in the construction of matter hamiltonian operators in the matter coupling cases .",
    "since it does not act at coplanar vertices automatically , we need not employ degenerate triangulation any more in the regularization procedure of the whole hamiltonian constraint operator for an on - shell anomaly - free constraint algebra . moreover , the fact that the new alternative inverse volume operator is bounded from above on the special and typical eigenstates of the standard volume operator with zero eigenvalue opens a possibility to lift the result of singularity resolution of lqc to lqg .    in what follows",
    ", we briefly recall the elements of lqg and establish our notations and conventions .",
    "the hamiltonian formalism of general relativity ( gr ) is formulated on a four - dimensional manifold @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being a three - dimensional manifold of arbitrary topology . in ashtekar - barbero variables @xmath8 [ indices @xmath9 refer to the tangent space of @xmath7 and @xmath10 to the @xmath11 lie algebra ] , gr can be cast as a dynamical theory of @xmath12 connections .",
    "the phase space is determined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the barbero - immirzi parameter . by @xmath16",
    "we denote a closed , piecewise analytic graph embedded in @xmath7 , which is a set of edges that intersects at most at their end points .",

    "the projective techniques admit us to equip @xmath20 with a natural , faithful measure @xmath21 , called the ashtekar - isham - lewandowski measure , and then the kinematical hilbert space is given by @xmath22 .",

    "the cotriad operator @xmath1 , as a quantum version of the integral @xmath28 of the cotriad @xmath29 ( here @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the pauli matrices ) along a `` short '' segment @xmath3 , has been widely applied to quantize a lot of physically interesting functions .",
    "for example , it appears in the construction of the length operator @xcite , the hamiltonian constraints of pure gravity , and gravity coupled with matter . in this section , the cotriad operator is used to construct a new alternative volume operator .    classically , the volume function of an arbitrary three - dimensional region @xmath32 can be expressed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cotriad , and we have used @xmath35 . to regularize the volume function into a version that can be easily promoted as a well - defined operator in @xmath23 , we triangulate @xmath36 into a series of cells @xmath37 with parameter volume @xmath38 so that @xmath39 .",

[ figure-1 ] ) .     into eight cubes @xmath41.,width=302 ]    then we obtain classically @xmath44 where @xmath45 corresponds to the process of shrinking @xmath41 to its base - point @xmath43 , and @xmath46 is the approximation of the integral of @xmath47 along @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 is the volume function of any region containing @xmath50 .    to proceed from the classical formula to the quantum expression ,",
    "we first promote the classical holonomies and volume function to their quantum versions .",
    "then we replace poisson bracket by commutator times @xmath51 .",
    "thus the classical volume function @xmath52 can be quantized as @xmath53 with @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 , and @xmath56 denotes the @xmath57 volume operator defined in @xcite .",
    "now we study the action of @xmath58 on a cylindrical function @xmath59 over a graph @xmath16 .",
    "the result depends on the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath16 ( or @xmath41 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the relation contains the following three cases : ( i ) @xmath60 ; ( ii ) @xmath61 but does not contain a vertex of @xmath16 ; ( iii ) @xmath61 and contains a vertex of @xmath16 .",
    "detailed discussions parallel to those of @xcite show that the results are trivial ( or 0 ) in the former two cases .",
    "hence it is natural for us to partition @xmath36 in the way adapted to @xmath16 . for a given @xmath27 ,",
    "we single out a noncoplanar triple of edges of @xmath16 at the vertex @xmath62 , and denote the corresponding three segments of the triple of edges starting from @xmath62 with parameter length @xmath63 by @xmath64 .",
    "we then construct a cube @xmath41 adapted to the three segments @xmath64 such that the three segments are the boundary edges of @xmath41 . by reversely extending @xmath64 we obtain three more segments .",
    "then we can get another seven `` mirror '' cubes with the six segments . together with @xmath41 , the eight cubes consist of the cell @xmath37 for which we look .",
    "since the information of @xmath41 has been implied in the segments , we can omit the notation @xmath41 for simplification .",
    ". reduces to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of the triples of noncoplanar edges of @xmath16 at @xmath62 , and the second sum is over these triples . the case for the coplanar vertices",
    "is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "similar to the discussion in @xcite , it turns out that @xmath67 in is actually independent of the parameter length @xmath63 of @xmath3 .",
    "hence the limitation in can be taken trivially , which yields the alternative volume operator @xmath68      we have presented the derivation of a new alternative volume operator by using the so - called cotriad operator @xmath1 .",
    "a natural question is whether the two volume operators , the alternative volume operator and the standard operator in @xcite , have the same properties . to answer this question ,",
    "let us first recall the formula of the standard volume operator and its key properties , then analyze the properties of the alternative one .",
    "the standard volume operator is derived from two regularization procedures in @xcite .",
    "its only regularization ambiguity @xmath69 is fixed as @xmath70 in @xcite .",
    "its action reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . here",

    "we show step by step that the above properties of the standard volume operator are preserved by the alternative volume operator .",
    "hence the two volume operators possess the same qualitative properties .",
    "it is easy to see that the alternative volume operator is gauge invariant , since under a gauge transformation , the cotriad operator @xmath1 changes to @xmath78 , which can be easily derived from the gauge transformations of the standard volume operator and the holonomies .",
    "the fact that the standard volume operator and holomomies transform covariantly with respect to diffeomorphism ensures that the alternative volume operator is also diffeomorphism covariant .",
    "now we show that the alternative volume operator also has the property ( ii ) of the standard one .",
    "consider a vertex @xmath27 at which three edges @xmath79 of @xmath16 are incident , and denote their three segments starting at @xmath62 by @xmath80 while denoting the remaining segments by @xmath81 .",
    "the result of applying @xmath82 to @xmath77 is a composition of spin - network states in which there exist terms depending on @xmath83 with the spins of the edges of @xmath16 differing from the considered three edges by @xmath84 while @xmath81 are unchanged .",
    "however , for the cases @xmath85 there exists no contractor at the divalent vertex @xmath86 to make such a state gauge invariant .",
    "to see that the alternative volume operator is symmetric , we notice @xmath87 and the identity @xmath88 therefore we have @xmath89^\\dag&=\\left[-\\frac{2}{i\\beta\\ell_{\\rm p}^2}{(h_{s_i}[h_{s_i}^{-1},\\hat{v}_{\\rm std}])^a}_b\\right]^\\dag\\notag\\\\ & = \\frac{2}{i\\beta\\ell_{\\rm p}^2}\\left[\\hat{v}_{\\rm std}\\delta^a_b-\\overline{{(h_{s_i}^{-1})^c}_b}\\hat{v}_{\\rm std}\\overline{{(h_{s_i})^a}_c}\\right]\\notag\\\\ & = \\frac{2}{i\\beta\\ell_{\\rm p}^2}{(h_{s_i}[h_{s_i}^{-1},\\hat{v}_{\\rm std}])^b}_a\\notag\\\\ & = -{(\\hat{e}_i)^b}_a\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , for a given @xmath62 , the second sum of the terms in can be written as @xmath90\\notag\\\\ & = \\frac12\\sum_{s_i\\cap s_j\\cap s_k = v}\\epsilon^{ijk}\\left\\{{\\rm tr}\\left(\\hat{e}_i\\hat{e}_j\\hat{e}_k\\right)+\\left[{\\rm tr}\\left(\\hat{e}_i\\hat{e}_j\\hat{e}_k\\right)\\right]^\\dag\\right\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies that the alternative volume operator is symmetric .",
    "let us turn to prove that the alternative volume operator acts trivially on a coplanar vertices .",
    "consider a coplanar vertex @xmath27 at which the tangent vectors of edges of @xmath16 incident span a two - dimensional surface @xmath91 . in order to partition the region containing @xmath62 adapted to @xmath16 , we need to add a new segment that is transversal to @xmath91 at @xmath62 . with the new additional segment , we get cubes based at @xmath62 .",
    "the form of the volume operator @xmath92 at the coplanar vertex @xmath62 is the same as the one in , but one of triple segments @xmath64 is the new additional segment at @xmath62 .",
    "assume that @xmath3 is a segment of one edge of @xmath16 .",
    "then the action of cotriad operator @xmath1 associated with @xmath3 on cylindrical functions @xmath59 with respect to @xmath16 yields @xmath93\\cdot f_\\gamma\\notag\\\\ & = -\\frac{2}{i\\beta\\ell_{\\rm p}^2}\\left(\\hat{v}^{\\rm std}_v - h_{s_i}\\hat{v}^{\\rm std}_vh_{s_i}^{-1}\\right)\\cdot f_\\gamma=0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we used one property of the standard volume operator that vanishes at the coplanar vertex @xmath62 .",
    "hence , for a coplanar vertex @xmath27 , the nontrivial result of @xmath92 applying to @xmath59 corresponds to the case in which the triples @xmath64 are all transversal to @xmath91 . on the other hand , for the nontrivial case ,",
    "@xmath1 does not change the graph and the spins associated to the edges of the spin network , but only changes the intertwiners .",
    "the result of this action is independent of the intersection character with edge @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "hence , for a coplanar vertex @xmath62 , the cotriad operators @xmath1 commute with each other .",
    "this means that the result of @xmath82 acting on @xmath59 does not depend on the ordering of the three cotriad operators .",
    "therefore we get @xmath95 .",
    "this completes the proof that the alternative volume operator acts trivially at coplanar vertices .",
    "finally , we consider the action of the alternative volume operator on the gauge - invariant cylindrical function over @xmath16 with trivalent vertices .",
    "let us focus on a noncoplanar trivalent vertex @xmath62 of @xmath16 and denote the three edges starting from @xmath62 by @xmath96 .",
    "then one has @xmath97 appearing in the expression of the alternative volume operator at @xmath62 .",
    "notice that the intertwiner space for a gauge - invariant trivalent vertex @xmath62 is one dimensional , and the operator @xmath82 is gauge invariant .",
    "hence @xmath82 changes the intertwiner of a gauge - invariant trivalent vertex into itself up to a constant .",
    "in other words , any spin - network state with gauge - invariant trivalent vertices is an eigenvector of @xmath82 .",
    "denote the spins of the three edges @xmath96 incident at @xmath62 by @xmath98 .",
    "then the part of the spin - network state @xmath99 ( the notation @xmath100 denotes the segments @xmath3 ) corresponding to @xmath62 can be expressed graphically as ( see @xcite for an introduction to the graphical method in lqg ) @xmath101^{m_1}}_{\\,l_1}{[\\pi_{j_2}(h_{s_2})]^{m_2}}_{\\,l_2}{[\\pi_{j_3}(h_{s_3})]^{m_3}}_{\\,l_3}\\notag\\\\ & = ( -1)^{2j_3}{\\mathord{\\vcenter{\\hbox { \\includegraphics[width=3cm]{graph / graph - snf-1}}}}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a normalized intertwiner @xmath102{graph / tri - wigner}}}}}&={\\mathord{\\vcenter{\\hbox { \\includegraphics[width=2cm]{graph / tri - intertwiner-1}}}}}\\notag\\\\ & = \\sqrt{2j_3 + 1}{\\mathord{\\vcenter{\\hbox { \\includegraphics[width=2.6cm]{graph / tri - intertwiner}}}}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then at @xmath62 , the action of @xmath92 on @xmath99 is @xmath103^\\dag\\right\\}\\right|\\cdot t^{v , s}_{\\gamma,\\vec{j},\\vec{i}}(a)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used eq . in the second step .",

    "since the new inverse volume operator takes the form similar to the new volume operator , it is convenient for us to compare the properties between the new inverse volume operator and the new volume operator .    in the loop quantization of gravity coupled to matter fields , one needs to employ an inverse volume operator to construct the matter hamiltonian operator . according to the treatment of eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) in @xcite for the original inverse volume operator , one has to adopt the degenerate triangulation at coplanar vertices of spin networks in the regularization procedure of the hamiltonian in order to obtain an on - shell anomaly - free quantum constraint algebra .",
    "it is shown in sec .",
    "[ ii ] that a new inverse volume operator can be constructed in the light of the construction of the alternative volume operator .",
    "the expression of the alternative inverse volume operator implies that it is also possessed of the same qualitative properties of the alternative volume operator .",
    "thus the action of the operator on spin - network states vanishes at coplanar vertices , and hence the essential term of the hamiltonian operator for the scalar field also has trivial action on coplanar vertices .",
    "this property ensures that the quantum constraint algebra of the whole system of gravity coupled to the matter is anomaly free on shell without any special requirement on the regularization , though the action of the hamiltonian constraint operator creates new coplanar vertices to the spin networks .    in the isotropic cosmological model",
    ", the inverse volume operator corresponds to @xmath151 , where @xmath152 represents the scale factor .",
    "an interesting result in lqc is that the corresponding operator @xmath153 is bounded above and even vanishes on the zero eigenstate of the volume operator in lqc .",
    "this property is useful in understanding the big bang singularity resolution in lqc .",
    "while this property is not maintained by the inverse volume operator discussion in @xcite , the alternative inverse volume operator does maintain it .",
    "the reason is that we take an operators ordering in nature way , which is different from that in @xcite .",
    "note that the cylindrical functions defined on the graphs with only trivalent or coplanar vertices are all zero eigenstates of the standard and alternative volume operators as well as the alternative inverse volume operator .",
    "thus , the construction of the inverse volume operator opens a possible way to lift the result of singularity resolution of lqc to lqg .",
