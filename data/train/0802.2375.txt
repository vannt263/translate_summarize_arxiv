    "solitary waves play important role in a great variety of applications because they are robust against perturbations and they can transport various physical quantities such as mass , energy , momentum , electrical charge , and also information @xcite .",
    "many popular continuum nonlinear equations support traveling solutions , but for their discrete analogs the existence of traveling solutions was not systematically studied until recently .",
    "previously , only a few integrable lattices were known to support moving solitons , e.g. , the toda lattice @xcite and the ablowitz - ladik lattice @xcite , the former being the discrete version of the kdv equation and the latter of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . while integrable lattices of other key continuum models are also available @xcite , these integrable situations are still rather exceptional and typically not directly relevant to experimental settings . on the other hand ,",
    "recently several wide classes of discrete models supporting translationally invariant ( ti ) _ static or stationary _ solutions have been discovered and investigated for the discrete klein - gordon equation @xcite and the discrete nls equation @xcite .",
    "static solitary waves in such lattices possess the translational goldstone mode @xcite , which means that the solitary waves moving with _ vanishing _ velocity can be regarded as the exact solutions to these discrete equations ( although there are issues for finite but small velocities as explained e.g. , in @xcite ) . moving solutions propagating along a lattice at _",
    "finite _ velocity have also been found analytically in @xcite and with the help of specially tuned numerical approaches in @xcite .",
    "traveling bright solitons in the nls lattice model with saturable nonlinearity are also very interesting @xcite . for this model",
    "the existence of soliton frequencies with vanishing peierls - nabarro energy barrier was demonstrated .",
    "it was shown that for the specific frequencies the static version of the model equation coincides with that of the integrable ablowitz - ladik equation @xcite .",
    "this implies in the mapping analysis a possibility to reduce the three - point map to a two - point map .",
    "however , the studied model equation is not integrable and while the solitary waves moving with small velocity were numerically obtained for the specific frequencies , the question about the existence of solitary waves moving with finite velocities remains open .",
    "existence of lattices supporting the static ti solutions and the exact solutions moving with finite velocity poses a natural question , about whether there is a relation between them . in the present study we answer this question in the positive , creating a link between these two classes of solutions below .    on the other hand ,",
    "as regards the solitary wave motion , another interesting question is the existence of upper bound for the propagation velocity . in view of lorentz invariance , clearly",
    "the solitary waves in continuum nonlinear equations of the klein - gordon type have limitations on their propagation velocity .",
    "one of the questions that we examine below is whether a similar restriction exists in the corresponding discrete models .",
    "since the lorentz invariance is no longer a symmetry of the discrete nonlinear systems , strictly speaking there need not be any restriction on the propagation velocity .",
    "however , naively one would expect that typically the propagation velocity in the discrete nonlinear systems would be similar to the ones supported by their continuous counterparts and not develop supersonic values .",
    "recently , three of us @xcite confirmed this naive expectation in a generalized discrete nls equation . a natural question , however , is whether this always holds true .",
