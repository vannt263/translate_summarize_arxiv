    "anisotropic flow in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite can be simply understood as the hydrodynamic response to spatial anisotropy in the initial state  @xcite .",
    "the largest components of anisotropic flow are elliptic flow , @xmath3 , and triangular flow , @xmath4 . in hydrodynamics , both are determined to a good approximation by linear response  @xcite to the eccentricity @xmath5  @xcite and triangularity @xmath6  @xcite of the initial energy density profile . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability distribution of anisotropic flow  @xcite directly constrains the initial geometry  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the initial anisotropy @xmath7 are to a first approximation gaussian  @xcite . when the anisotropy is solely due to fluctuations ( that is , with the notable exception of @xmath3 in non - central nucleus - nucleus collision , which is mostly driven by the eccentricity in the reaction plane ) , non - gaussianities can be measured directly using higher - order cumulants of the distribution of @xmath8 , for instance the order 4 cumulant @xmath9 .",
    "non - gaussian flow fluctuations have first been seen through @xmath10 in pb - pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "similar non - gaussianities are seen in initial - state models of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 has also been measured in p - pb collisions  @xcite , and is also predicted by standard initial - state models  @xcite .",
    "the question therefore arises as to what non - gaussianities can tell us about the density fluctuations in the initial state : do they reveal interesting features of the dynamics , or are they the result of some general constraints ?",
    "it has been pointed out for instance that the condition @xmath12 alone generates a universal non - gaussian component  @xcite , which matches recent measurements of higher - order cumulants @xmath13 and @xmath14 in p - pb collisions  @xcite . on the other hand , this is known to be only approximate .",
    "general analytic results about the statistics of @xmath7 can be obtained within a simple model where the initial density profile is a superposition of pointlike , independent sources  @xcite .",
    "non - gaussianities arise typically as corrections to the central limit  @xcite .",
    "expressions of @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite reveal a non - trivial dependence on the initial density profile , thus breaking the universal behavior just mentioned , as will be illustrated in sec .",
    "[ s : identical ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to assess more precisely what the non - gaussianity of anisotropy fluctuations may tell us about the initial density profile and its fluctuations , thereby extending the study initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the case of central collisions , i.e. @xmath15 , where initial anisotropies are solely due to fluctuations . in the next section we recall general definitions of eccentricities and the cumulants of their probability distribution . then in sec .",
    "[ s : identical ] , we review known results from the independent source model . in sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "technical material is gathered in several appendices .",
    "we first recall the definitions of the anisotropy @xmath7 and of the cumulants @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the energy density in a given event , where @xmath19 is the complex coordinate in the transverse plane .",
    "the complex fourier anisotropies  @xcite are defined by @xmath20 where we use the short hand @xmath21 for the integration over the transverse plane .",
    "the definition ( [ defepsn ] ) assumes that the center of the density lies at the origin . in an arbitrary coordinate system",
    ", one must replace @xmath22 with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the center of the distribution .",
    "we refer to this correction as to the `` recentering '' correction .",
    "the density @xmath18 fluctuates event to event , which entails fluctuations of the eccentricities @xmath7 .",
    "there is therefore an associated probability distribution of @xmath25 . assuming that @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath25 in every event , the probability of @xmath25 is , up to a rescaling , the measured probability distribution of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "experimental observables involve even moments of this distribution , which are conveniently combined into cumulants .",
    "the first 2 cumulants @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined as  @xcite : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{defcumul4 } \\varepsilon_n\\{2\\}^2&\\equiv&\\langle|\\varepsilon_n|^2\\rangle\\cr \\varepsilon_n\\{4\\}^4&\\equiv & 2\\langle |\\varepsilon_n|^2\\rangle^2-\\langle    averages over events in a given centrality class .",
    "note that cumulants of anisotropic flow , which are defined similarly , with @xmath7 replaced by @xmath8 , were originally introduced  @xcite in order to eliminate nonflow correlations : the idea was that higher - order cumulants such as @xmath9 would isolate collective motion , and that the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath9 was due to jets and other sources not driven by collective flow .",
    "it was then recognized that nonflow correlations are largely suppressed by rapidity gaps  @xcite and that the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath9 mostly comes from fluctuations in the initial geometry , i.e. , it originates from the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    if the anisotropy is solely due to fluctuations , and if the distribution of anisotropy fluctuations is gaussian @xcite , @xmath17 vanishes .",
    "thus a non - vanishing @xmath17 directly reflects the non - gaussianity of anisotropy fluctuations .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath7 in every event for @xmath28 , then the observation of a positive @xmath11 in proton - nucleus collisions  @xcite implies that @xmath29 , and the observation of a positive @xmath10  @xcite in nucleus - nucleus collisions , at all centralities , implies that @xmath30 .",
    "since the anisotropy is due to fluctuations in both cases , this in turn implies that these fluctuations are not gaussian .    as already stated , our goal is to see what these results tell us about the fluctuations of the density @xmath18 .",
    "the task is complicated by the fact that the relation between density and eccentricity fluctuations is not a direct one , because the relation ( [ defepsn ] ) between @xmath18 and @xmath7 is non linear .",
    "also , the same relation ( [ defepsn ] ) shows that @xmath31 ensures that @xmath12 .",
    "this puts a constraint on the allowed range of local density fluctuations .",
    "our efforts will mostly focus on the relations between the cumulants of the density fluctuations and those of the eccentricity fluctuations .",
    "our study is limited to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but higher - order cumulants such as @xmath32 could be studied in a similar way .",
    "we first recall known analytical results obtained within a simple model where the energy density is represented by a sum of identical , pointlike sources , much as in a monte carlo glauber simulation  @xcite : @xmath33 the positions @xmath34 of the sources , @xmath35 , are independent random variables with probability @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 is fixed . with this normalization ,",
    "the total energy is @xmath39 .",
    "it is dimensionless .",

    "the anisotropy @xmath7 still differs from zero in general because the number of sources @xmath40 is finite ( @xmath40 controls the strength of the fluctuations , which vanishes as @xmath46 ) .",
    "the non linear dependence between @xmath18 and @xmath7 is reflected here in a non linear dependence of @xmath7 on the position of the sources .",
