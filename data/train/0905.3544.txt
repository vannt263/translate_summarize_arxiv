    "the studies of the parameters of the standard model and the searches for a ` new physics ' in the properties of @xmath0 mesons inevitably run into the usual problem that we formulate our theories in terms of quarks and gluons , while the experimental data are collected in terms of hadrons .",
    "thus an interpretation of the wealth of data accumulated at the b factories within the underlying theory crucially depends on our ability to cope with the strong dynamics and to ` translate ' between the quark - gluon and hadronic ` languages ' . in this lecture",
    "i discuss some known results in such a ` translation ' and the existing uncertainties , which still limit the precision of extracting the theoretical parameters",
    ". some of these uncertainties can be somewhat relaxed with a help from new data , however some still appear to be beyond the current understanding of the strong dynamics . in what follows",
    "i discuss the current theoretical uncertainties in the precision of determination of the weak - interaction parameters from the data and , in some cases , the ways of reducing such uncertainties by further phenomenological studies of the yet unknown theoretical parameters resulting from the strong dynamics .",
    "the studies at the b factories thus far have not produced any credible indications of a ` new physics ' . however",
    "the unprecedented amount of high precision data accumulated in the process may be a treasure trove for learning new aspects of the qcd dynamics of quarks and leptons .",
    "in particular , one unexpected spin - off from the experiments at the b factories is the observation of a multitude of heavy resonances , both with open and hidden charm , displaying highly unusual properties , apparently indicating that some of those are the much expected exotic states , i.e. their structure goes beyond the standard quark - antiquark template for mesons . at present",
    "it looks like the new resonances fall into different categories according to their different internal structure .",
    "i discuss here two such types : the apparently ` molecular ' state @xmath1 and a class of resonances ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) which decay into specific charmonium states and pions .",
    "i describe in some detail the model , where these latter states are that of a ` hadro - charmonium ' , i.e. they can be considered as a compact charmonium state embedded in excited light - matter .",
    "the weak decays of @xmath4 hadrons provide us with the access to measurements of the entries in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix , describing the weak interaction mixing of the third quark generation .        the most straightforward technique for determining the mixing parameter @xmath5 is to apply the essentially parton picture to the rate of inclusive semileptonic decay of a @xmath4 hadron , i.e. to identify the decay rate of a hadron , e.g. @xmath7 , with the quark decay rate due to the process @xmath8 , modulo small nonperturbative terms that take into account the ` fermi motion ' of the @xmath4 quark and also the @xmath4 quark spin interaction with the chromomagnetic field that the heavy quark ` sees ' inside the hadron .",
    "those nonperturbative terms are suppressed by the parameter @xmath9 and can be treated@xcite within an application of the operator product expansion to the inclusive decay rates@xcite .",
    "certainly , such approach assumes that the @xmath4 quark mass is large enough for the uncontrollable low - energy non - perturbative effects to die out and thus for the quark - hadron duality to set in .",
    "it is not known at present to which accuracy this assumption works , however to some extent it is tested in the treatment of the lifetimes of @xmath4 hadrons and their differences , as will be discussed further in this lecture .",
    "one trivial cross - check of such approach is to verify its prediction that in absolute terms the inclusive semileptonic decay rates @xmath7 should be the same .",
    "the data agree with this expectation very well : according to the tables @xcite , one can deduce @xmath10  @xmath11 .",
    "the charmless decay @xmath12 contributes only about 2% to each of these rates , so that this small contribution can be treated in either way without introducing an uncertainty exceeding the experimental error .",
    "the theoretical expression for the decay rate thus has the generic form ( clearly related to the familiar muon decay expression ) ( b x_c ) = g_f^2 |v_cb|^2 m_b^5 192 ^3 f ( m_c m_b )  , [ gsli ] with the well known kinematical function f(x)=1 - 8x^2 + 8 x^6 - x^8 - 24x^4 x  .",
    "the explicit form of the corrections depends on the scheme used in a definition of the quark masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the latter mass parameters and the uncertainty in them in fact dominate the problem of extracting @xmath5 from the data .",
    "one approach@xcite to this problem is to fit these kinematical quantities from the data on the spectra in the semileptonic @xmath0 decays , e.g. from the moments of the charged lepton energy @xmath15 : @xmath16 ( in this classification @xmath17 ) .",
    "the difficulty of this approach is in the nonuniform over the spectrum experimental sensitivity and in that higher moments are generally less certain theoretically due to larger corrections and also due to enhanced potential importance of the unknown deviations from the quark - hadron duality .",
    "a typical fit to the available data along these lines yields ( see e.g. in @xcite ) @xmath18 , where the error includes the experimental errors and the error of the fit but does not include any theoretical uncertainty .",
    "an alternative way of extracting the mixing parameter @xmath5 is provided by the prediction from the heavy quark symmetry for the form factors of the decays @xmath20 and @xmath21 at zero recoil@xcite , i.e. when the final charmed meson is produced at rest .",
    "namely at the kinematical point where @xmath22 the axial form factor @xmath23 : d^*()| ( |c _ 5 _ b ) | b = _",
    "f(1 ) [ aform ] and the vector form factor @xmath24 : d| ( |c _ 0 b ) | b = g(1 ) [ vform ] are both close to one with only perturbative correction and corrections to the heavy quark limit : @xmath25 pert.corr .",
    "@xmath26 . the averages@xcite of the experimental results for the measurable products of these form factors with @xmath5 are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus the real issue is the theoretical estimate of how far the form factors deviate from one as a result of the corrections .",
    "the axial form factor @xmath29 is estimated to be about 0.92 both analytically@xcite and numerically ( on a lattice )  @xcite with an error believed to be of few percent , where ` few ' typically implies 3 to 6 .",
    "this estimate results in @xmath30 \\times 10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "the vector form factor is estimated numerically@xcite as @xmath31 , which results in @xmath32 \\times 10 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "although the two exclusive determinations of @xmath5 are in a perfect agreement with one another and also agree , within the uncertainties , with the inclusive determination , the estimates for the form factors may raise some reservations .",
    "the reason is that additionally to the heavy quark symmetry the closeness of @xmath33 ( but not of @xmath29 ) to one is also protected by the ademollo - gatto theorem@xcite in the limit @xmath34 . in the real world",
    "the masses of the charm and bottom quarks are of course different , however the relevant parameter breaking the symmetry limit in @xmath33 is @xmath35 ^ 2 \\approx 0.25 $ ]  @xcite , and one could expect that some ` remnants ' of the symmetry suppress the difference @xmath36 in comparison with the ` unprotected ' @xmath37 . clearly , the currently used estimates of the deviations of the form factors from one show no traces of such a suppression . it can be noticed that if the actual values of the form factors indeed satisfy the ademollo - gatto requirement literally : @xmath38 $ ] , all three determinations of @xmath5 would naturally ` click ' into place , noticeably better than they are currently believed to .",
    "namely , with @xmath39 one finds |v_cb| = 4 g(1 ) |v_cb| + f(1 )    from the inclusive semileptonic decay . the data",
    "then also imply that @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    it can be also mentioned that an agreement between all three determinations of @xmath5 can be viewed as a test of the @xmath42 structure of the @xmath43 weak current . in particular the limit on the ratio of the right- and left - chiral amplitudes",
    "@xmath44 is about 0.15  @xcite .",
    "although it is not directly related to the determination of the ckm parameters , the low measured overall semileptonic branching fraction @xmath45 has been challenging to the theoretical understanding of the weak decays of the @xmath0 mesons@xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative effects ( in the hadronic decay ) are smaller for the @xmath46 meson .",
    "thus the experimental number appropriate for a use as a reference is @xmath47 . on the theoretical side @xmath48 is determined dominantly by the ` parton ' decay branching ratio : _ sl(b c e ) = ( b c e ) _ = e , , ( b c ) + ( b c |u d(s ) ) + ( b c |c s ( d))+(b u x ) + _ rare [ bsl ] with the main factor determining the ratio being the ratio of the quark and the semileptonic decay rates of the @xmath4 quark : = 1 + _ s 2 + _",

    "the calculation@xcite of nnlo terms in the @xmath50 radiative correction has increased the predicted relative hadronic decay rate and thereby lowered the prediction for the overall semileptonic branching fraction from 11.5% to 11% . as a result",
    ", the remaining gap between the theory and the data does not look as baffling@xcite as it used to .",
    "the study of of the differences between inclusive decay rates of different @xmath4 hadrons provides an insight into the applicability of using the heavy quark limit and the operator product expansion ( ope ) in the minkowski domain , i.e. the validity of the presumed quark - hadron duality . within the ope based approach the inclusive decay rate",

    "the scattering of the mesons near the threshold can be analyzed in both isotopic channels with @xmath139 and @xmath140 , and the interplay between the kinematics involving two thresholds for the @xmath119 and @xmath141 states and the isospin symmetry of the underlying strong interaction produces a distinctive pattern of the dependence of the isospin structure of the scattering states on the energy @xmath142 relative to the threshold@xcite .",
    "this pattern can be tested by observing a different behavior of the threshold peaks in the @xmath122 ( @xmath140 ) and the @xmath123 channels in the processes @xmath138 as illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "the charmonium resonances with mass below the open charm threshold ( @xmath144 ) are narrow due to suppression of the annihilation of a heavy quark pair into light hadrons .",
    "this suppression , known as the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule also finds its quantitative explanation in qcd  @xcite .",
    "conversely , for higher charmonium resonances , i.e. those above the open charm threshold , the decay into pairs of charmed mesons should not be suppressed , and those resonances should be broad .",
    "the known charmonium states indeed generally follow this rule , e.g. @xmath145 is only @xmath146mev above the @xmath147 threshold , and its width is about 25mev and is essentially all due to the decay into pairs of charmed mesons .",
    "however notable exceptions from such pattern have been recently found .",
    "the resonance @xmath148 with quantum numbers @xmath149 has a large width of about 80mev , but non of its decays into charmed mesons have ever been seen .",
    "rather the observed decay modes are @xmath150 and @xmath151  @xcite",
    ". subsequently more @xmath149 peaks with similar behavior were observed in the range 4.32 - 4.36mev , @xmath152  @xcite and near 4.66mev , @xmath153  @xcite , corresponding to the decay @xmath154 ( but not @xmath155 ) . finally , a manifest isotopic non - singlet @xmath156 has been reported@xcite ( but not yet independently confirmed  @xcite ) in @xmath0 decays , corresponding to a resonance in the @xmath157 channel , followed by an indication  @xcite of similar peaks @xmath158 and @xmath159 decaying into @xmath160 .",
    "the apparent existence of resonances that decay into a specific low - mass charmonium state and light hadrons invites an explanation  @xcite that these resonances in a sense already contain inside them that charmonium specific state . in other words ,",
    "these high - mass resonances contain charmonium embeded in an excited light hadronic matter , so that in their observed decays the light degrees of freedom are ` shaken off ' .",
    "generally the idea of a binding of charmonium in a light matter is not novel  bound states of @xmath155 inside nuclei has been discussed for some time  @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of the structure of the possible new resonances , which we call hadro - charmonium , is that the ligh - matter ` host ' for the charmonium is an excited ( and unstable ) state rather than a stable nucleus .",
    "the existence of such states can be understood in the limit of heavy quarkonium and of a highly excited light - matter resonance by considering a van der waals type interaction between the quarkonium and the light matter  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a compact charmonium state ( call it generically @xmath161 ) with long wave length gluonic field inside light hadronic matter can be described in terms of the multipole expansion in qcd@xcite with the leading term being the e1 interaction with the chromo - electric field @xmath162 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian arising in the second order in this interaction can then be written as h_eff= -1 2 ^ ( ) e_i^a e_i^a  , [ hdiag ] where @xmath163 is the ( diagonal ) chromo - electric polarizability of the state @xmath161 having the dimension of volume , and which can be expressed in terms of the green s function @xmath164 of the heavy quark pair in a color octet state : ^ ( ) = 1 16 | ^a r_i g r_i ^a |  , [ alpsi ] with @xmath165 being the relative position of the quark and the antiquark and @xmath166 the difference of the color generators acting on them : @xmath167 ( a detailed discussion can be found e.g. in the review @xcite ) . finally , the qcd coupling @xmath59 is included in the normalization of the field strength in eq.([hdiag ] ) , so that e.g. the gluon lagrangian in this normalization takes the form @xmath168 .",
    "the diagonal chromo - electric polarizability is not yet known for either of the charmonium states , although it can be directly measured for the @xmath169 resonance@xcite .",
    "what is known is the off - diagonal chromo - polarizability @xmath170 describing the strength of the amplitude of the transition @xmath171 : @xmath172 gev@xmath173  @xcite . on general grounds ,",
    "the diagonal chromo - polarizability for each of the @xmath169 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 states should be real and positive , and for the former two the schwartz inequality ^(j/ ) ^( )    discussed diagonal parameters should exceed the off - diagonal one , and also that the chromo - polarizability for the @xmath174 and @xmath175 states is larger than that of the @xmath169 due to their larger spatial size .",
    "the strength of the van der waals type interaction between a charmonium state and a hadron ( generically denoted here as @xmath126 ) can be evaluated using the effective hamiltonian ( [ hdiag ] ) and the well known expression for the conformal anomaly in qcd in the chiral limit : _",
    "^= -9 32 ^2 f_^a f^a = 9 16 ^2 ( e_i^a e_i^a - b_i^a b_i^a )  , [ anom ] where @xmath176 is the chromo - magnetic field , and the ( normalization ) expression for the static average of the trace of the stress tensor @xmath177 over any state @xmath126 in terms of its mass @xmath178 : x | _ ^(q=0 ) | x = m_x  , [ mx ] which is written here assuming nonrelativistic normalization for the state @xmath126 : @xmath179 . averaging the effective hamiltonian ( [ hdiag ] ) over a hadron @xmath126 made out of light quarks and/or gluons ,",
    "one thus finds x | h_eff | x - 8 ^2 9 ^ ( ) m_x  , [ ieff ] where the inequality arises from the fact that the average value of the full square operator @xmath180 over a physical hadron @xmath126 has to be non - negative .",
    "the relation ( [ ieff ] ) shows an integral strength of the interaction .",
    "namely , if the force between the charmonium ( @xmath161 ) and the light hadronic matter inside the hadron @xmath126 is described by a potential @xmath181 , such that @xmath182 goes to zero at large @xmath183 , this relation gives the bound for the integral v(x ) d^3x - 8 ^2 9 ^ ( ) m_x  .",
    "[ iint ]    the value of the integral in eq.([iint ] ) , although undoubtedly corresponding to an attraction , does not by itself automatically imply existence of a bound state , since it does not take into account the kinetic energy , which in a nonrelativistic treatment of the system is @xmath184 , with @xmath185 being a characteristic size of the hadron @xmath126 and @xmath186 the reduced mass in the system .",
    "the spatial integral of the kinetic energy is then parametrically of order @xmath187 , and , given the relation in eq.([iint ] ) , the condition for existence of a bound state can be written as ^ ( ) m_x |m r c  , [ cond ] where @xmath188 is a numerical constant ( parametrically of order one ) which depends on a model for the distribution of the interaction over the interior of the hadron @xmath126 and thus on a more precise definition of the  characteristic size \" @xmath185 .",
    "considering the condition ( [ cond ] ) for excited light - matter resonances , one can readily see that the appearance of a hadro - charmonium state , possibly at a higher excitation , depends on the behavior of the combination @xmath189 with the excitation number of the resonance @xmath126 .",
    "in particular , if the characteristic size @xmath185 grows slower than the mass @xmath178 a binding of charmonium necessarily occurs in a sufficiently highly excited resonance .",
    "such behavior takes place , e.g. in the once popular bag model@xcite , where @xmath190 .",
    "however in models which reproduce the approximately linear behavior of the regge trajectories for the resonances , such as string model including its recently discussed@xcite implementation in terms of ads / qcd correspondence with ` linear ' confinement , one effectively finds @xmath191 , and a more accurate estimate  @xcite proves that the binding of heavy quarkonium necessarily occurs at sufficiently high excitation of the light hadronic matter .",
    "also one can argue  @xcite that in the limit of large mass @xmath53 of the heavy quark the decay of such states into open heavy flavor channels , requiring a reconnection of the heavy - heavy and light - light binding , is suppressed as @xmath192 .",
    "obviously , the existing idealized theoretical picture can provide only qualitative guidance for the properties of the real - life hadro - quarkonium states .",
    "the most straightforward of these qualitative predictions are the following : +    * in addition to mesonic hadro - charmonium resonances there should exist bound states of baryo - charmonium , i.e. bound states of @xmath155 , @xmath193 , @xmath175 with baryonic excitations at low baryon number .",
    "such states should decay into e.g. a nucleon + @xmath155 , possibly with additional pions .",
    "* there should exist resonances decaying into pion(s ) plus other low - mass states of charmonium , @xmath194 , @xmath175 .",
    "this prediction  @xcite is in a qualitative agreement with the apparent observation of @xmath195  @xcite . *",
    "in addition to the observed decays into final states with the ` preferred ' specific charmonium state , e.g. @xmath196 , the hadro - charmonium resonances should also decay , at a smaller rate , to non - preferred states , e.g. @xmath197 due to a ` deformation ' of charmonium in the bound state . * a similar to hadro - charmonium structure of resonances should exist for the bottomonium in the range around 11 - 11.5gev , most likely with the excited low - mass bottomonium states ( due to a larger chromo - polarizability of the excited states ) .",
    "a possible hadro - bottomonium structure is in fact hinted by the data@xcite on the @xmath198 yield near 10.9gev .",
