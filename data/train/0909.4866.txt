    "moreover , we have shown how to incorporate the horizon condition into the schwinger - dyson equation for the ghost propagator to discriminate between scaling and decoupling .",
    "we have examined two horizon conditions derived from two types of horizon terms , both of which were proposed by zwanziger @xcite .",

    "the value @xmath90 has been assumed implicitly to be zero @xmath100 in previous studies .",
    "for the first horizon term @xcite , @xmath223 the gz theory is not multiplicatively renormalizable .",

    "i.e. , infinite ghost dressing function in the limit @xmath224 : @xmath229 , even after the renormalization . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the decoupling solution is obtained against the claim in the previous literatures .",
    "thus the investigation of @xmath0 is crucial to see which solution is realized .",
    "an interesting step towards this direction was done in @xcite . however , according to our analysis , their result , namely , the decoupling solution with @xmath56 is not compatible with the multiplicative renormalization scheme they used : @xmath230 $ ] , @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "this issue should be reexamined and confirmed by further investigations .",
    "if we require that two horizon conditions give the same result , then the relation @xmath233 must be satisfied for any @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that for any @xmath49 @xmath121 then , in the unrenormalized case , the kugo - ojima criterion is compatible with the decoupling solution for both choice of horizon term , against the conventional wisdom where the scaling solution is believed to be consistent with the kugo - ojima criterion .",
    "however , @xmath53 , @xmath91 and @xmath90 are not renormalization group invariants .",
    "there is no guarantee that this relation is preserved .",
    "in fact , the kugo - ojima criterion is preserved only for the second horizon term . in order to judge which horizon function",
    "is realized , one need to know the result of numerical simulations on finer lattice , i.e. , with smaller lattice spacing corresponding to larger ultraviolet cutoff , in addition to larger size lattices . but",
    "this might be impossible , because the horizon term alone does not uniquely fix the gauge , since there are still gribov copies in the first gribov region .",
    "thus we can conclude that @xmath0 plays the role of an additional non - perturbative gauge parameter which uniquely specifies the solution from a one - parameter family of solutions including the scaling and decoupling . in view of this",
    ", the value of @xmath0 itself has no physical meaning .",
    "in fact , it has been shown @xcite that all solutions ( decoupling as well as scaling ) lead to quark confinement by proving the vanishing of the polyakov loop as a gauge - invariant order parameter of quark confinement . in this sense , discriminating between decoupling and scaling may not be so important from the physical point of view and main contribution to phenomenological studies comes from the high - momentum region and the intermediate region around 1gev which is stable irrespective of adopting the scaling or decoupling solution .",
    "it is shown that both scaling and decoupling solutions do not contradict the general principles of quantum gauge field theories @xcite .",
    "how the existence of the horizon is relevant for color confinement . in the gribov - zwanziger theory ( restricted to the 1st gribov region ) , the brst symmetry is broken by the existence of the horizon . @xmath234 .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a `` brst '' like symmetry ( without nilpotency @xcite or with nilpotency @xcite which leaves the gribov - zwanziger action invariant",
    ". then we could apply the kugo - ojima idea to the gribov - zwanziger theory , which opens the path to searching for the modified color confinement criterion _ a la _ kugo and ojima . in view of this , defining a non - perturbative brst transformation will be another interesting possibility to be investigated @xcite .
