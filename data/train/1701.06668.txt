    "both stability and instability results have been obtained ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "of particular relevance to this thesis is @xcite where luk and oh show that generically @xmath23 is singular in the @xmath3 sense , namely the @xmath12 norm of the derivative of @xmath23 with respect to a regular , cauchy horizon transversal vector field blows up at the cauchy horizon . on the other hand ,",
    "franzen proved in @xcite that the solution is non - singular in the @xmath6 sense , and moreover that the solution is uniformly bounded in the black hole interior , up to and including the cauchy horizon , to which it can be continuously extended .",

    "it follows immediately from the @xmath3 blow up result of @xcite that we in fact have generic @xmath4 blow up for every @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , given a compact neighbourhood @xmath24 of any point of the cauchy horizon , we have @xmath25 when @xmath5 . from this",

    "we thus have @xmath6 stability and @xmath4 instability of solutions for @xmath26 , but uncertainty remains over the precise nature of the instability . for physical reasons ,",
    "it is important to understand and quantify the strength of the singularity .",
    "our first result in this direction is the following _ conditional _ theorem , which holds for the full subextremal range of parameters with non - vanishing charge , i.e. @xmath27 , and identifies a condition on the black hole _",

    "furthermore , we show that for a certain subrange of the parameters the condition of the theorem does not hold ( i.e. the `` solution map '' is bounded below in @xmath30 in the black hole interior ) , and so establish @xmath4 instability in this parameter subrange for @xmath8 .",

    "we remark also that theorem [ mtv1 ] in particular shows the @xmath6 result of franzen @xcite is sharp , at least for the restricted parameter range @xmath38 .    while for technical reasons arising from the analysis in the black hole interior , we have only managed to prove our instability result , theorem [ mtv1 ] , for a subrange of the subextremal parameters - type estimates from a null hypersurface through the black hole interior to the event horizon .",
    "see theorem [ intl1 ] for details .",
    "] , one nonetheless expects that in fact @xmath4 instability holds for the full subextremal range with non - vanishing charge .",
    "indeed , if one navely extrapolates from results in the _ extremal _ case @xmath39 ( linear stability of the extremal cauchy horizon is shown in @xcite ) , then one may even think that the `` far away from extremality '' case is `` more unstable '' than the `` near extremality '' case . similarly for the cosmological case ,",
    "heuristic arguments in @xcite show that we expect the cauchy horizon of reissner ",
    "de sitter to be `` more unstable '' `` far away from extremality '' than `` near extremality '' .",
    "ironically , however , we succeed in proving instability only `` near extremality '' due to the technicalities in the black hole interior , but remain optimistic that the result can be extended to the full parameter range .",
    "we thus make the following conjecture .",
    "let @xmath28 be a complete @xmath19-ended asymptotically flat cauchy hypersurface for the maximal globally hyperbolic development of a subextremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime with non - vanishing charge .",
    "then , for each @xmath8 , generic smooth and compactly supported initial data on @xmath28 give rise to solutions that are not in @xmath4 in a neighbourhood of any point on the future cauchy horizon @xmath29 .",
    "although this conjecture remains open , we show in theorem [ mtv1 ] that at the very least it holds for the the subrange @xmath38 of black hole parameters .",
    "this contrasts with the expectation in the cosmological case , where a heuristic argument suggests the following conjecture :    for each non - degenerate reissner ",
    "de sitter spacetime , there exists @xmath37 such that solutions of the linear wave equation with smooth and compactly supported data on a cauchy hypersurface are in @xmath40 near the cauchy horizon .",
    "this conjecture is supported by @xcite , in which hintz  vasy showed that for all non - degenerate reissner ",
    "de sitter spacetimes , solutions are in @xmath41 near the cauchy horizon for some @xmath42 .",
    "scales like @xmath30 near the cauchy horizon . ]",
    "( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where schwarzschild  de sitter , kerr and kerr  de sitter spacetimes are considered . )",
    "thus the strength of the singularity is different for the asymptotically flat and cosmological cases .",
    "this is ultimately due to the differing decay properties of solutions in the black hole exterior regions , namely in reissner  nordstrm solutions decay polynomially in the exterior whereas in reissner ",
    "de sitter solutions decay exponentially in the exterior .    as with other instability results ,",
    "theorems [ conditionalinstab ] and [ mtv1 ] are motivated by the strong cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "this conjecture , perhaps the most fundamental open problem in mathematical general relativity , is the subject of a huge body of literature .",
    "we will not discuss the conjecture itself here , but refer the reader to section 1.4 of @xcite ( and the references within ) where it is discussed in detail .",
    "here , it suffices to say that , if true , the strong cosmic censorship conjecture would imply that small perturbations of the reissner  nordstrm spacetime for the _ nonlinear _ einstein ",
    "maxwell equations give rise to a singular cauchy horizon .",
    "the linear wave equation which we study is regarded as a `` poor man s linearisation '' of the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations , and so the generic @xmath4 blow - up result presented in this work is evidence in favour of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture .",
    "our instability result strengthens the @xmath3 result of luk  oh , implying that the cauchy horizon is more singular than was implied by @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the proofs of the two theorems above . as theorem [ conditionalinstab ]",
    "follows almost immediately from the proof of theorem [ mtv1 ] , in particular from identifying how the proof of theorem [ mtv1 ] may fail outside the parameter range @xmath31 , our main challenge is in proving theorem [ mtv1 ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mtv1 ] proceeds by showing that if @xmath31 , then for each @xmath8 there is a spherically symmetric solution arising from smooth and compactly supported initial data which is singular in the @xmath4 sense , from which it follows that the set of smooth , compactly supported data which correspond to regular solutions is of codimension at least @xmath43 .    in analogy to @xcite ,",
    "the existence of the spherically symmetric solution of the previous paragraph is shown by identifying a condition near null infinity that prevents a spherically symmetric solution from belonging to @xmath4 in any neighbourhood of the future cauchy horizon - this is shown using a contradiction argument .",
    "indeed , we show that regularity of a spherically symmetric solution in the black hole interior implies upper bounds on the solution in the exterior region that contradict lower bounds that are implied if the condition at null infinity holds .",
    "it then remains only to identify a spherically symmetric solution arising from smooth and compactly supported data on the cauchy surface @xmath28 which satisfies the condition near null infinity .",
    "note that while the proof of theorem [ mtv1 ] is philosophically similar to the proof for the case @xmath44 in @xcite , theorem [ mtv1 ] is not implied by @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that the argument in @xcite uses an @xmath12-type upper bound near the cauchy horizon as the contradictive assumption and from this deduces a @xmath12-type upper bound in the black hole exterior which contradicts a @xmath12-type lower bound obtained from the condition near null infinity .",
    "we , however , assume a @xmath10-type upper bound as our contradictive assumption , and show that it implies a @xmath10-type upper bound in the black hole exterior which contradicts a @xmath10-type lower bound deduced from the condition near null infinity .",
    "this conclusion that the @xmath10-type upper bound is false could not be reached assuming the @xmath12 upper bound assumption of @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of the contradiction argument is the propagation of @xmath10-type upper bounds from the black hole interior to the exterior .",
    "this is achieved by establishing a chain of estimates .",
    "we show a weighted @xmath10 term involving certain derivatives of a spherically symmetric solution on a constant @xmath45-hypersurface in the exterior can be controlled by a corresponding weighted @xmath10 term on the event horizon and a data term .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath10 term on the event horizon can in turn be controlled by a corresponding @xmath10 term on a cauchy horizon transversal null hypersurface in the interior together with a data term . for @xmath8 , proving these various @xmath10 type estimates in a direct manner seemed intractable , so we prove them indirectly using real interpolation .",
    "indeed , we establish analogous estimates for the cases @xmath46 and @xmath44 ( the endpoint estimates ) and interpolate between these estimates to deduce the family of desired intermediate estimates for @xmath8 .",
    "it is precisely this method of proof which allows us to conclude the conditional instability result theorem [ conditionalinstab ] : we obtain the necessary @xmath10-type estimates precisely when the corresponding @xmath11 and @xmath12-type estimates hold . while we succeed in establishing the @xmath12 estimates and the exterior @xmath11 estimate for all subextremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetimes , the same is not true for the interior @xmath11 estimate . in other words , instability may fail precisely when we are unable to estimate the @xmath11 norm of a suitable derivative of the solution on the event horizon by the @xmath11 norm of the same derivative on a cauchy horizon transversal null hypersurface .",
    "this can be interpreted as a statement about the boundedness from below of the `` solution map '' in a @xmath30 sense , namely the condition given in theorem [ conditionalinstab ] .",
    "we now give an outline of the structure of the remainder of this section .",
    "we begin with a brief exposition on the geometry of subextremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime in section [ geometry ] . in sections",
    "[ exterior coordinates ] and [ interior coordinates ] , we introduce the coordinate systems in the black hole exterior and interior with which we work .",
    "we then discuss the linear wave equation ( section [ we2 ] ) , the notations and conventions which we adopt ( section [ nandc ] ) and we describe the class of initial data of interest ( section [ inda ] ) . in section [ sobspace ] we discuss the space @xmath4 on the interior of the reissner  nordstrm black hole .",
    "then , armed with these preliminaries , in section [ themaintheorem ] we give precise statements of theorem [ conditionalinstab ] and theorem [ mtv1 ] ( see theorem [ condinstab2 ] and theorem [ mtv2 ] ) and a detailed explanation of the strategy of their proofs in section [ pf of mainthm ] .",
    "the remainder of the thesis is devoted to proving these two results .",
    "the reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetimes are a @xmath19-parameter family of spacetimes : they represent a charged , non - rotating black hole as an isolated system in an asymptotically flat spacetime , and are indexed by the charge @xmath1 and the mass @xmath2 of the black hole .",

    ".,width=321 ]    we summarise now the key features of the geometry that will be important for us .",
    "recall that in a local coordinate chart , the metric @xmath16 may be written as @xmath48 we denote by @xmath49 and @xmath50 the distinct positive roots of the quadratic @xmath51 and assume that @xmath52 .",
    "the black hole region ( region @xmath53 in figure [ mghd ] ) is the complement of the causal past of future null infinity @xmath54 , in other words no signal from the black hole region can reach future null infinity .",
    "the black hole region is separated from the exterior regions ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the figure ) by its boundary , the bifurcate null hypersurface referred to as the future event horizon and given by @xmath57 .",
    "the white hole region ( region @xmath58 ) , past null infinity @xmath59 and the past event horizon @xmath60 are defined by time reversal .",
    "the expression for the metric given in has a coordinate singularity at @xmath61 but is valid everywhere else in @xmath62 .",
    "the null hypersurface @xmath63 is a smooth cauchy horizon .",
    "the component in the future of the black hole region is denoted @xmath29 and called the future cauchy horizon .",
    "the past cauchy horizon @xmath64 is defined similarly by time reversal .",
    "the presence of the smooth cauchy horizon means that the maximal globally hyperbolic development may be extended smoothly and non - uniquely as a solution of the einstein  maxwell equations .",
    "the strong cosmic censorship conjecture asserts that this property is non - generic .",
    "due to the symmetry of the asymptotically flat ends , it will suffice only to consider part of the maximal globally hyperbolic development , namely the region shaded in figure [ mghd ] .",
    "furthermore , it will be sufficient to consider only the incoming component of @xmath29 , that is the component on the right of the shaded region shown in bold .",
    "once we have the blow - up result for this component of the cauchy horizon , the result for the other component follows by analogy .",
