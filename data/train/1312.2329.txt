    "to conclude , we have shown that , by first - principles calculations , it is possible to synthesize silicene and germanene on the graphene substrate without destroying its characteristics of the dirac - fermion - like linear dispersion around dirac points , due to the weak van der waals interlayer interaction . in addition , multiple phases of single crystalline silicene or germanene with different orientations could coexist at room temperature based on our energetics analysis .",

    "for silicene on graphene , the gap could be as large as 57 mev .",
    "for germanene on graphene , the gap created by the substrate effect is of the same order as that induced by the soc effect .",
