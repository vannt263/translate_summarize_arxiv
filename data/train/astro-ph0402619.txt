    "this model includes self - consistent calculation of the spectrum produced by the comptonization of the soft photons in a hot plasma .",
    "it contains as free parameters the temperature of the comptonizing electrons , @xmath39 , the plasma optical depth with respect to the electron scattering , @xmath40 and the temperature of the input wien soft photon distribution , @xmath41 .",

    "the spectra of many luminous galactic lmxb are well fit with a two - component model consisting of a soft black body - like component which might represent emission from an optically thick accretion disk or from the neutron star surface , together with hard component which may be interpreted as emission from a corona - like structure or a boundary layer between the disk and a neutron star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used such two - component models to approximate spectra of the three brightest globular cluster sources showing spectral cut - off ( sources @xmath42 ) . and @xmath43 )    for the soft component we used multicolor disk - blackbody ( xspec diskbb)(@xcite ) and a black body ( xspec bbodyrad ) models .",

    "interestingly , even in the case of brightest m31 gc sources with total isotropic luminosities exceeding eddington limit for the @xmath52 neutron star , the absorption - corrected luminosity of the soft spectral component never significantly exceeds that limit . in conclusion ,",
    "the two - component approximation of the spectra of bright m31 gc sources gives spectral parameters consistent with high luminosity lmxbs hosting a neutron star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .      in order to characterize the overall spectral properties of the bright gc x - ray sources , we constructed a distribution of their spectral indices in the @xmath21 kev energy range using the model fits to both _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ data with an absorbed simple power law ( fig .",

    "therefore the similarity between the spectral distributions of the central bulge of m31 and that of its gc x - ray sources is not surprising .",
    "moreover , the peak of the m31 gc spectral index distribution coincides with the average value of the spectral photon index ( @xmath55 ) derived for the lmxb populations in the nearby galaxies of different morphological type ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral photon indices of the m31 gc x - ray sources in our sample were found to lie in the range , observed for the galactic gc sources , in agreement with previous studies ( @xcite ) .",

    "as it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ hardness_luminosity ] , there are three groups of sources , occupying distinct regions in the hardness - luminosity diagram .",
    "the first group represents majority of the brightest x - ray sources with luminosities above @xmath57 ergs s@xmath4 .",
    "the objects in this group have relatively narrow range of photon indices with average value of @xmath58 , suggesting common spectral formation mechanism at high luminosities .",
    "the second group comprised of fainter sources , shows greater variety of photon indices ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath59 .",
    "based on the wide range of x - ray luminosities , this group could represent a mix of lmxbs in both low and high luminosity states ( @xcite ) .",
    "the third group consists of two objects with extremely hard spectra ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "both objects also have a more pronounced spectral cut - off than the rest of the gc sources ( table [ spec_par_gcs_cutoffpl_comptt ] ) . in addition , one of the sources , the x - ray source @xmath61 in the globular cluster bo 158 , shows regular x - ray dips , implying a system observed at high inclination angle ( @xcite ) . the hardness - luminosity diagram of gc x - ray sources in our sample appears to be consistent with that of the central bulge ( @xcite ) .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivity of _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ observations allows a reliable measurement of low energy absorption toward brighter sources in m31 . using the results of spectral fitting , we have been able to estimate the value of equivalent hydrogen absorbing column , @xmath62 for 31 source in our sample . to make a homogeneous sample , we used the same simple spectral model to estimate @xmath62 for all sources ( an absorbed power law model ) .",
    "it should be noted , that the amount of low - energy absorption derived from spectral fitting sometimes depends strongly on the type of continuum model used to approximate x - ray spectrum ( table [ spec_par_gcs_xmm_powerlaw],[spec_par_gcs_cutoffpl_comptt ] ) .",
    "the simple power law approximation does not take into account possible presence of an additional soft x - ray component leading to the underestimation of the absorbing column .",
    "the choice of a particular model for the soft x - ray component ( i.e. black body vs. multicolor disk black body ) or a hard spectral continuum ( i.e. a comptonization model vs. simple power law ) introduces additional uncertainty in the value of @xmath62 .",
    "our analysis shows that for the large fraction of gc sources the derived value of @xmath62 is either in excess or consistent with galactic hydrogen column @xmath63 @xmath24 in the direction of m31 ( @xcite ) . in the first case ,",

    "<S> we present the results of m31 globular cluster ( gc ) x - ray source survey , based on the data of _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations covering @xmath0 arcmin@xmath1 of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> we detected 43 x - ray sources coincident with globular cluster candidates from various optical surveys .    </S>",
    "<S> the inferred isotropic x - ray luminosities of gc sources lie between @xmath2 and @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 in the @xmath5 kev energy band . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral properties of 31 brightest sources from our sample were found to be similar to that of the low mass x - ray binaries located in the bulge and globular clusters of the milky way galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral distribution of m31 gc x - ray sources is consistent with that derived for the bulge of m31 and other nearby galaxies of different morphological type . </S>",
    "<S> several sources demonstrate a correlation between the level of x - ray flux and hardness of their energy spectrum reminiscent of the galactic z and atoll sources .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that @xmath6 of the m31 gc sources with multiple flux measurements available show significant variability on a time scales from days to years . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray source rx j0043.2 + 4127 , coincident with gc bo 163 , has been found to show recurrent transient outbursts with peak luminosities of @xmath7 ergs s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> several sources in our sample show significant variability on a time scale of individual observations , ranging from aperiodic fluctuations to regular dipping .    the x - ray luminosity function of gc sources is found to be significantly different from that of the point sources in the bulge and disk of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity distribution of m31 gc sources has @xmath8 times higher peak luminosity and much higher fraction of bright sources than the milky way gc distribution . </S>",
    "<S> six persistent sources in our sample ( or @xmath9 of the total number ) have luminosities exceeding @xmath10 ergs s@xmath4 during all observations , and three other sources occasionally exceed that luminosity level . </S>",
    "<S> our observations indicate that gc sources make dominant contribution to the bright source counts in the areas of m31 covered by the survey : @xmath11 of the total number of sources with luminosities above @xmath12 ergs s@xmath4 reside in gcs with fraction of gc sources rising to @xmath13 for the luminosities above @xmath10 ergs s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the gc sources to the total number of bright sources found in m31 is much higher than in the milky way galaxy , but surprisingly close to the early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we found that brightest m31 gc sources tend to reside at large galactocentric distances outside the central bulge .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that globular clusters hosting bright x - ray sources are optically brighter and more metal rich than the rest of m31 globular clusters , in agreement with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest sources with luminosities above @xmath7 ergs s@xmath4 show tendency to reside in more metal poor clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable similarities between the properties of the m31 gc x - ray sources and that of the galactic neutron star lmxbs allow us expect most of the persistent m31 gc x - ray sources to be lmxb systems with neutron star primaries . </S>",
    "<S> however , the current x - ray spectral and timing data can not rule out the possibility of finding an active accreting black holes in our gc source sample .    * </S>",
