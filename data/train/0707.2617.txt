    "there are many strong observational connections between galaxy bulges and central supermassive black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "bh masses correlate surprisingly tightly with bulge properties , including luminosity ( e.g. ,  marconi & hunt 2003 ) and stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath14 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; tremaine et al.2002 ) .",
    "also active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the local universe are predominantly found in massive , bulge - dominated galaxies ( ho et al.1997b ; kauffmann et al .  2003 ) .",
    "perhaps the formation of bhs and bulges are related , in which case we might not expect bulgeless galaxies to obey scaling relations between bhs and galaxies , or even necessarily host a central bh . indeed , dynamical study of the bulgeless spiral galaxy m33 places strong limits on the presence of a dark central massive object ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2001 ) , while any bh in the nucleus of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy ngc 205 has been shown to lie below the low - mass extrapolation of the @xmath14  relation ( valluri et al .",
    "on the other hand , the m31 globular cluster g1 shows dynamical and radiative evidence for a central bh ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ; pooley & rappaport 2006 ; ulvestad et al.2007 ) . however , the mixed stellar population and high degree of rotational support in this massive cluster suggest that g1 is actually the nucleus of a tidally stripped dwarf galaxy ( e.g. ,  meylan et al .",
    "thus , dynamical studies present an ambiguous verdict on the presence of nuclear bhs in dwarf stellar systems . unfortunately , it is not currently feasible to spatially resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of a @xmath15  @xmath1  bh outside the local group , in order to search for bhs in more dwarf stellar systems using dynamical methods .",
    "although they are difficult to find , the occupation fraction of nuclear bhs in dwarf systems and the space density of low - mass bhs are of considerable interest .",
    "apart from furnishing additional insight into the possible origin of the @xmath14  relation , low - mass bhs provide low - redshift counterparts to the primordial seed bhs ; the low - mass cut - off in the bh mass function today provides a constraint on the mass function of seed bhs .",
    "the merging of bhs in this mass range is expected to provide a strong signal for the gravitational wave experiment _ lisa _",
    "( e.g. ,  hughes 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , gravitational radiation recoil is expected to impart velocities to bh merger remnants that exceed the escape velocities of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. ,  favata et al .  2004 ; merritt et al .",
    "this effect alone might decrease the occupation fraction of bhs in dwarf galaxies .    in the absence of detectable dynamical signatures ,",
    "we are forced to rely on less direct evidence for the presence of nuclear bhs , namely agn activity .",
    "in fact , there are two well - studied agns in dwarf galaxies : ngc 4395 is a bulgeless spiral galaxy ( filippenko & sargent 1989 ) , while pox 52 ( kunth et al .",
    "1987 ) is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( barth et al .",
    "bh mass determinations are far less certain in the absence of dynamical constraints , but a variety of techniques yield bh masses for each object of @xmath15  @xmath1  ( filippenko & ho 2003 ; barth et al.2004 ; peterson et al .",
    "greene & ho ( 2004 ; gh hereafter ) performed a systematic search for agns with    -0.15 in bh masses @xmath16  @xmath1 , using the first data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) and recovered 19 objects in that preliminary search .",
    "remarkably , follow - up spectroscopy using esi on keck suggests that these sources , as well as ngc 4395 , pox 52 , and g1 , are consistent with the low - mass extrapolation of the @xmath14relation ( barth et al .",
    "at the same time , many of the host galaxies are late - type galaxies without classical bulges ( j.  e.  greene , et al . in preparation ) .",
    "clearly , more objects are needed to both confirm this preliminary result , and also to constrain the structural parameters of the host galaxies . to this end , we have repeated our analysis using the fourth data release of the sdss ( dr4 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) , and present the updated sample here .",
    "our goal is to study the properties of the lowest - mass bhs that are identifiable with the sdss .",
    "the upper mass limit on this sample is somewhat arbitrary . within the inactive sample of galaxies with dynamical bh masses ,",
    "the bh in m32 , @xmath3=@xmath17  @xmath1 , has the lowest mass ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; excluding the milky way , whose modern mass is @xmath18  @xmath1 ; e.g. ,  ghez et al .  2005 ; eisenhauer et al .",
    "we have adopted @xmath19  @xmath1  as the upper limit for our search . because dynamical methods can not extend into this regime , we previously had constraints on neither the existence of lower - mass bhs nor on whether they obey similar scaling relations with galaxy bulge properties as their high - mass cousins .",
    "furthermore , while there are good reasons to believe that not every dwarf stellar system contains a bh , we do not know at what mass the occupation fraction departs from unity .",
    "throughout we assume the following cosmological parameters to calculate distances : @xmath20  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( spergel et al .",
    "-0 mm    our low - mass bhs are selected from the sample of broad - line agns with @xmath23 described in detail by greene & ho ( 2007b ) and briefly reviewed here for completeness .",
    "we begin with dr4 of the sdss and search for all agns with broad h@xmath24 , where `` broad '' in this context means a significant extra component relative to the narrow - line profile ( based on the [ ]  @xmath25 doublet ; e.g. ,  ho et al .",
    "continuum subtraction , which is crucial to uncover low - contrast broad lines , is performed with the principle component analysis method developed by hao et al .",
    "our subsequent selection technique comprises a two - step procedure : we first select objects with high root - mean - square ( rms ) deviations above the continuum in the region potentially containing broad h@xmath24 , and then perform more detailed profile fitting to isolate those objects with broad h@xmath24  profiles .",
    "unfortunately , this selection process results in many sources of such low h@xmath24  luminosity that ( 1 ) their nature is ambiguous and ( 2 ) our ability to recover a reliable bh mass is severely compromised . based on simulations ,",
    "we thus impose a combined rms - weighted flux and equivalent width ( ew ) cut designed to minimize spurious detections .",
    "the resulting sample comprises 8435 objects .",
    "since we can not use stellar dynamical methods to measure bh masses , we instead use the photoionized broad - line region ( blr ) gas as a dynamical tracer of the bh mass . while the blr velocity dispersion is derived from the line width , the blr radius is inferred from the agn luminosity ( in this case h@xmath24 ; greene & ho 2005b ) .",
    "the so - called radius - luminosity relation is derived from reverberation mapping of @xmath26 agns , for which radii are measured based on the delay between variations in the agn photoionizing continuum and blr line emission ( e.g. ,  kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ; greene & ho 2005b ; bentz et al.2006 ) .",
    "the `` virial '' bh mass is simply @xmath3=@xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a scaling factor that accounts for the unknown geometry of the blr , assumed here to be spherical ( @xmath28=0.75 ; netzer 1990 ) .",
    "although bh masses derived from reverberation mapping are susceptible to large systematic errors ( due to uncertainties in the blr geometry and kinematics ; e.g. ,  krolik 2001 ) , remarkably they have been shown to agree with @xmath29 , in those cases for which @xmath29  can be measured .",
    "the measured scatter is @xmath30 dex ( gebhardt et al.2000b ; ferrarese et al .",
    "2001 ; onken et al .  2004 ; nelson et al .",
    "virial masses are less direct , since they rely on the radius - luminosity relation ; in the largest such comparison to date , greene & ho ( 2006 ) find a scatter of @xmath31 dex of single - epoch virial masses about the @xmath14  relation . our bh mass estimator is discussed in detail in the appendix .",
    "here we simply note that greene & ho ( 2007b ) used an old version of the radius - luminosity relation slope , while here we have updated the value to that found by bentz et al .",
    "in general , the derived masses increase by @xmath30 dex .    selecting those broad - line agns with masses @xmath32  @xmath1results in a sample of 174 objects , which are the main subject of this paper ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in addition , some ( 55 ) of the objects below the detection threshold are nevertheless interesting candidates .",
    "these objects have been selected by manual inspection of the spectra , and thus comprise a biased and incomplete sample .",
    "we worry , as explained above , that our bh masses are not stable for these h@xmath24luminosities , but we deem these objects worthy of follow - up spectroscopy . in what follows we will refer to these objects as the _ c _  ( `` candidate '' ) sample , and we will present all trends including and excluding these objects .",
    "basic properties of the sample are summarized in table 1 .",
    "our modeling of the h@xmath33  region warrants some additional discussion . while the continua of our spectra , in general , are dominated by stellar light , in some cases",
    "there is an additional `` pseudo - continuum '' component contributed by broad  multiplets .",
    "the  emission extends over the entire optical and uv spectrum , but is especially troublesome in the wavelength ranges 44004800 and 51505500  . in principle , both the h@xmath33  and [ ]  @xmath344959 , 5007 fits can be severely compromised when the  component is ignored ( see fig .",
    "we follow standard procedure and model the  emission with an empirical template ( e.g. ,  boroson & green 1992 ; greene & ho 2005b ) .",
    "since many of our sources also require substantial galaxy subtraction , the , h@xmath33 , and [ ]  lines are modeled simultaneously in the galaxy - continuum  subtracted spectrum , as described below .",
    "in addition to an  template , our model includes narrow [ ] , and narrow and broad h@xmath33 . in the standard way , all relative wavelengths for central narrow components are fixed to laboratory values , and the narrow h@xmath33  flux is fixed to be no more than 1/3.1 of the narrow component of h@xmath24  ( case b@xmath35 recombination ; halpern & steiner 1983 ; gaskell & ferland 1984 ) .",
    "the [ ]  lines are fit simultaneously with a core and a wing component , following greene & ho ( 2005a ) , with a relative strength of 2.96 , while the narrow h@xmath33  line is modeled with a single gaussian due to its typical low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "usually ,  templates are derived from 1  zw  i , a strong  source with relatively narrow broad lines . with a broad - line width of fwhm  @xmath36 km  s@xmath7(boroson & green 1992 ) , 1  zw",
    "i  is significantly broader than many of the objects in our sample .",
    "for this reason , we are compelled to build our own  template from the sdss data . using a high s / n spectrum of sdss j155909.62@xmath37350147.4 ,",
    "whose @xmath38   is 860 km  s@xmath7 , we model h@xmath33 + [ ]  using the 47505100   region with no  template included ( fig . 2_a _ ) , and subtract this model .",
    "we further mask the regions 48404870   and 50105018   ( note these wavelengths are in vacuum ) , since these regions are dominated by noise in the subtraction . while the resulting template is similar to 1  zw  i  ( fig .",
    "2_b _ ) , it is clear that we do not recover the shape of the 5000   feature perfectly , and that there are slight differences in continuum slope between the two templates . to explore the importance of the former problem",
    ", we have repeated our fitting procedure using templates made with various masking regions , and find no difference in the derived fit parameters .",
    "the continuum shape , on the other hand , remains a systematic uncertainty inherent to our method ; there is some degeneracy between the shape of the continuum and the amplitude of  contamination , leading to uncertainties in the overall amplitude of .",
    "nevertheless , our measured h@xmath33 + [ ]  fits are robust to this uncertainty .",
    "when we fix the  template to values ranging from one - half to twice the best - fit value , we find @xmath39 changes in all other measured parameters .",
    "presumably the [ ]  is sufficiently resolved from the component at 5000   so that small errors in the latter do not strongly impact our model of the former .",
    "let us examine how the original gh sample compares with this new larger sample .",
    "objects from the original paper will be referenced using their identification number in that paper ( e.g. , gh02 ) .",
    "there are no significant differences between the two works , but there are some issues worth noting . in general , we have improved our selection procedure ( see greene & ho 2007b ) , so that our sample from dr1 is close to two and a half times larger than the original sample .",
    "we are now using the h@xmath24  rather than the @xmath40  luminosity to derive the blr radius , and we are using the updated radius - luminosity relation slope of bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . only one ( gh19 ) of the gh objects is not included in the final dr4 broad - line agn sample of greene & ho ( 2007b ) , although gh07 , gh11 , gh15 , gh16 , and gh18 now have masses above our mass boundary of @xmath41  @xmath1 . finally , the original gh sample excluded galaxies with significant galaxy contamination , due to the fear that these objects would comprise more massive bhs with low - contrast broad lines that were rendered undetectable by the large galaxy luminosity . in this work",
    "we have not explicitly included such a cut , but our ew threshold is operationally similar . while some of the objects in the _ c _  sample may consist of high - mass interlopers ,    -0.1 in -0 mm we find in general very good agreement in properties between the two samples .",
    "dong et al .",
    "( 2007a ) have presented a low - mass bh with a mass of @xmath42  @xmath1 .",
    "this source was selected from the fifth data release of the sdss , and so can not be cross - checked with our sample .",
    "however , the object has been serendipitously observed with _ hst _  and _ xmm - newton _ , as well as being detected with the rentgen satellite ( _ rosat _ ) .",
    "there is tentative evidence for variability in the x - ray source ( @xmath43  ergs s@xmath7 ) and the host galaxy is a disk galaxy with @xmath44 mag and a nuclear bar .",
    "the same group has identified a sample of 245 low - mass bhs from dr4 , with a mass range of @xmath45  @xmath1 , and eddington ratios ranging from 0.02 to 8 , comparable to our sample ( dong et al .",
    "samples selected from two independent methods will provide important tests on the limitations of our method .",

    "( 2005 ) , and would increase by @xmath30 dex according to the formalism adopted in this paper .",
    "the final sample has a median redshift of 0.086 ( 0.099 if the _ c_sample is excluded ) .",
    "the original sample has a slightly lower median @xmath46 due in part to subsequent deep observations in the southern strip ( targeting quasars to a limiting magnitude of @xmath47 mag rather than @xmath48 mag ) . in figure 1",
    "we show the distribution of `` virial '' bh mass and eddington ratio for the sample , where @xmath49  ( @xmath3/@xmath1 ) ergs s@xmath7 . assuming that @xmath50 @xmath40  ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ) , in terms of @xmath51  our bolometric correction is @xmath52 ergs s@xmath7  ( greene & ho 2005b ) .",
    "the median bh mass is @xmath2@xmath3@xmath53  @xmath1 . with a median @xmath2@xmath54@xmath55 ,",
    "we are clearly dominated by sources radiating at substantial fractions of their eddington limits ( fig .",
    "this is not surprising ; as discussed by greene & ho ( 2007b ) , we are only sensitive to the most luminous bhs in this mass regime .",
    "the statistical power of our new enlarged sample provides new constraints on the ensemble physical properties of both the radiating bhs and their host galaxies .",
    "we begin by placing the sources on the two - dimensional diagnostic diagrams that in combination discriminate between a stellar ionizing spectrum or one considerably harder ( e.g. ,  baldwin et al .  1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "these line ratios are typically used to divide emission - line galaxies into galaxies and narrow - line agns ( e.g. ,  ho et al .",
    "1997a ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; hao et al .",
    "2005 ; table 2 ) . in contrast , broad - line ",
    "selected objects are unbiased with regard to position on the diagnostic diagrams , while at the same time we know that some fraction of the ionizing continuum is contributed by an agn .",
    "we focus first on the [ ]  @xmath56/h@xmath24  diagnostic diagram ( fig .",
    "we do not see many objects in the lower - right quadrant .",
    "objects there are low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ; heckman 1980 ) sources and typically are highly sub - eddington agns ( ho 2004 ) . compared to classical seyfert galaxies , which occupy the upper - right region of the diagnostic diagram , we see that our sources span a broader range in both [ ] /h@xmath24  and [ ] /h@xmath33 .",
    "the decrease in [ ] /h@xmath24  is most easily explained as a decrease in the gas - phase metallicity of these agns ( e.g. ,  kraemer et al .",
    "1999 ; groves et al .",
    "2006 ) . since nitrogen is a secondary element , [ ]  is particularly sensitive to changes in metallicity for @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast , the [ ] /h@xmath33ratio changes much more slowly , because as the metallicity decreases , the temperature of the nlr increases correspondingly , which tends to boost the [ ]  strength ( e.g. ,  groves et al .  2004a , 2006 ; see metallicity tracks on fig .",
    "relatively low metallicities for this sample are not unexpected , since local agn hosts in general are known to be massive , bulge - dominated galaxies ( e.g. ,  ho et al .",
    "1997b ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ) , while these low - mass bhs tend to live in low - mass and correspondingly low - metallicity systems (  3.4 ; tremonti et al .  2004 ) .",
    "more striking is the apparent corresponding decrease in [ ] /h@xmath33 , which as we have seen , can not be ascribed to a decrease in metallicity . in fact , [ ] /h@xmath33  appears to decrease in concert with [ ] /h@xmath24 , [ ] /h@xmath24 , and [ ]  @xmath58/h@xmath24(fig .",
    "3_b , c _ ) . at the same time",
    ", there is a clear trend of increasing [ ]  @xmath59/ [ ]  line ratios as the [ ] /h@xmath33  ratio decreases ( fig .",
    "changes in a variety of nlr conditions , including metallicity , electron density ( @xmath60 ) , ionization parameter ( @xmath61 ) , ionizing spectral shape , and reddening might be invoked to explain the observed line ratios , while particular properties of either the agn ( e.g. ,  luminosity or eddington ratio ) or the host galaxy ( e.g. ,  star formation ) may be responsible for the changing conditions . as we will argue , it is unlikely that a single parameter is responsible for all of these trends .",
    "correlated errors might also be expected to move line ratios in particular ways across the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "if , for instance , we are systematically overestimating the strength of narrow h@xmath24  in systems with weak nlr emission , then we might expect correlated tracks as observed .",
    "however , [ ]  is never blended with broad h@xmath33  in these sources , and thus [ ]  errors are not correlated with the other lines , but nevertheless the [ ]  line strength spans a wide range relative to h@xmath33 .",
    "one might imagine that the intrinsic line ratios are all located in the seyfert locus , but that contamination from star formation spreads out their positions in the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "we perform a simple thought experiment to demonstrate that there must be an intrinsic spread in line ratios to reproduce the observed trends . since star - forming galaxies follow a well - defined sequence in the diagnostic diagram ( bounded by the kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 relation shown fig .",
    "5 ) , we can easily investigate the type of bias that star formation would contribute . in figure 5",
    "we have chosen three fiducial agn positions in the diagnostic diagram .",
    "position a represents a typical high - ionization system , while b has low [ ] /h@xmath33  and [ ] /h@xmath24  and c represents a liner . to each agn",
    "we add varying amounts of star formation with line ratios drawn from the kauffmann line , and the h@xmath33  strength in star formation varying from half to twice the agn h@xmath33  luminosity .",
    "the tracks ( shown as dash - dot , solid , and dashed lines for positions a , b , and c , respectively ) demonstrate that while star formation may increase the spread in positions on the diagnostic diagram , it alone can not move objects from the high - ionization position a to the low-[]/h@xmath33  positions we observe .",
    "there must be a true spread in the intrinsic agn line ratios .",
    "furthermore , position c is disfavored , since only with a large fraction of the light contributed by low - metallicity star formation might we move the objects from position c toward position b. if the objects in this sample follow the mass - metallicity relation of tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , with typical luminosities of @xmath62 ( table 3 ,  3.4 ) , they would not , on average , have sub - solar metallicity .",
    "given that the dispersion in line ratios must be intrinsic to the nlr , we investigate various means to explain the observed line - ratio distributions .",
    "ho et al .  (",
    "1993 ) find that narrow - line agns display a similar trend in the occupation of diagnostic diagrams , which they ascribe to a trend of harder ionizing spectral shape at lower luminosity .",
    "exactly this trend has been seen in the x - ray to optical slopes of broad - line agns over a wide range in luminosity ( e.g. ,  strateva et al .",
    "2005 ) , including for a subset of the gh sample ( greene & ho 2007a ) .",
    "a correlation between low - luminosities and harder spectral shape would lead to a correlation between agn luminosity and line ratios , but we see no trends between agn luminosity ( as traced by @xmath51 ) and either [ ] /h@xmath33  or [ ] /h@xmath24 .    we have already discussed the impact of varying metallicity above , and since [ ] /h@xmath24  is most sensitive to its variation , metallicity is unlikely to explain the correlated decrease in [ ] /h@xmath24 , [ ] /h@xmath24  and [ ] /h@xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , metallicity variations alone can not explain the large observed range in [ ] / [ ]  ratios ( fig .",
    "changes in either ionization parameter or density might explain the [ ] / [ ]  ratios ; increases in either leads to a relative increase in [ ] .",
    "indeed , electron densities inferred from the ratio of the [ ]  lines show a significant correlation with [ ] /h@xmath33 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is @xmath63 , with a probability @xmath64 that no correlation is present .",
    "however , there is only a mildly significant trend between electron density and [ ] /h@xmath24  ( @xmath65 ) and no trend with [ ] /h@xmath24  ( @xmath66 ; as one might expect given their lower critical densities ) . on the other hand , changes in ionization parameter move , for example ,  [ ] /h@xmath24  vs. [ ] /h@xmath33  on tracks perpendicular to those observed ( e.g. ,   groves et al .",
    "2004a , b ) .",
    "a single parameter seems unable to reproduce all of the observed trends simultaneously .",
    "presumably this is due , in part , to stratification in the density and ionization parameter of the nlr with radius , which leads to different typical conditions in the emission regions of different lines ( e.g. ,  filippenko & halpern 1984 ) .    in summary",
    ", a single parameter can not be invoked to explain the observed positions in the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "-0.2 in although changing physical conditions ( such as electron density ) within the nlr may be important , the objects lying close to the star - forming locus may simply have an extremely weak nlr , such that the majority of the narrow emission is coming from regions .",
    "a similar phenomenon , the `` vanishing '' nlr , has been seen in a substantial fraction of higher redshift agns at high eddington ratios ( e.g. ,  netzer et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) . if observed correlations between nlr size and agn luminosity ( e.g. ,  bennert et al .  2002 ;",
    "schmitt et al.2003 ) are extrapolated to the highest luminosities , then one would predict unbound nebulosities ; netzer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suppose that the nlrs in these systems grew so large that they were no longer bound to their host galaxies .",
    "the luminosities in our systems are significantly lower , and the expected nlr sizes are @xmath67  pc if they obey the nlr size - luminosity relation , but we can not rule out that the agn actually expelled some large fraction of the surrounding ism , leading to overall weakness in the line intensities .    finally , there is an apparent connection between [ ] /h@xmath33  and eddington ratio ( e.g. ,  boroson 2002 ) . however",
    ", for these objects there is no trend between [ ] /h@xmath33(narrow ) and @xmath54  ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) or [ ]  equivalent width and @xmath54  ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "these trends do not change when the _ c _ sample is excluded . on the other hand , although no physically motivated explanation exists , low [ ] /h@xmath33  traditionally was a defining characteristic of the class of objects known as narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) ,    which are broad - line agns with relatively narrow broad - line widths .",
    "we turn now to a general comparison of our objects with nls1s .",
    "while nls1s are an observationally defined class , a picture has emerged , based on their strong /h@xmath33  and weak [ ] /h@xmath33line ratios , strong soft x - ray excess ( e.g. ,  boller et al .",

    "we highlight comparisons between the optical and broad spectral properties of this and other nls1 samples .",
    "one of the supporting pieces of evidence that nls1s are radiating close to their eddington limit comes from their observed high /h@xmath33  ratios ( e.g. ,  vron - cetty et al .  2001",
    "; throughout this section we refer to _ total _ [ broad+narrow ] h@xmath33luminosity ) . using principle component analysis",
    ", boroson & green ( 1992 ) found that nls1s lie at one extreme of their first component ( fondly known as eigenvector 1 ) , and later work has shown that eigenvector 1 properties , including high /h@xmath33  and low [ ] /h@xmath33  ratios ,    -0.2 in as well as soft x - ray excess and radio weakness , tend to be correlated with eddington ratio ( e.g. ,  boroson 2002 ) . on the other hand",

    "a more compelling argument for intermediate - age stellar populations comes from the strength of the higher - order balmer lines apparent in the stacked spectra ( fig .",

    "while the systems ( at least to first order ) obey the @xmath14relation , they do not necessarily contain classical bulges .",

    "therefore even near their eddington limits these bhs are not capable of providing as much energy per unit host galaxy mass as more massive systems .",

    "while programs to measure blr radii for lower - luminosity sources are underway , at the moment we have no choice but to adopt the results for the more luminous sources .",

    "the width of the broad emission lines represents the gas kinematics , but in practice it is unclear how to derive the most robust velocity dispersion measure . it has long been clear that the broad line shape depends systematically on other agn properties including line width ( or bh mass ) and luminosity ( e.g. ,  sulentic et al .",
    "2000 ) ; in general , narrower lines have more lorentzian shapes ( e.g. ,  vron - cetty et al .",
    "if the geometry and kinematics of the blr change with eddington ratio ( as suggested by these observations ) then the assumption of a single geometrical factor @xmath28 breaks down .",
    "in other words , the measured virial mass for a given bh may vary as changes in the eddington ratio lead to changes in the blr kinematics and thereby @xmath28 .",
    "an extreme example of this effect is reported for agns with double - peaked balmer lines ( bian et al .",
    "2007 ) .    without independent information",
    "it is impossible to determine @xmath28 as a function of @xmath54 .",
    "luckily , the @xmath14  relation provides an independent handle on the bh mass . especially for the relatively low - luminosity agns considered at low redshift , it is safe to assume that the systems intrinsically obey the @xmath14  relation , and adopt the @xmath14-derived mass as the true bh mass . both onken et al.(2004 ) and greene & ho ( 2006 ) find evidence for an average offset of @xmath140 dex from masses derived with @xmath141 .",
    "however , as argued above , we expect that @xmath28 is not a constant , but rather depends on @xmath54 .",
    "while greene & ho ( 2006 ) looked for evidence of a trend between @xmath28 and @xmath54 , their dynamic range in both bh mass and luminosity was too limited to draw robust conclusions .",
    "collin et al .  ( 2006 ) perform an exhaustive study of the relation between line shape and virial mass .",
    "they use the onken et al .",
    "sample of 14 agns with both reverberation - mapped masses and @xmath29measurements to investigate the merits of different measures of the line width .",
    "specifically , they compare virial bh masses estimated from the fwhm and the luminosity - weighted second moment of the velocity profile ( @xmath116 ) with the @xmath29-derived bh mass .",
    "as described above , they find that narrower lines are peaky ( small values of fwhm/@xmath116 ) while broader lines are boxy ( large values of fwhm/@xmath116 ) . as a result ,",
    "the inferred @xmath28 may depend not only on whether fwhm or @xmath116 is used to measure line width , but also on the line shape . using the comparison between virial mass and @xmath29",
    ", they derive a different value of @xmath28 for each subset of objects ( 9 peaky and 5 boxy ) using both fwhm and @xmath116 .",
    "they claim that while @xmath28 is constant across line samples when @xmath116 is used as the velocity dispersion indicator , the fwhm provides a biased measure of the virial mass because @xmath28 is smaller for the boxy subset .",
    "however , investigation of their table reveals that the values of @xmath28 derived from fwhm measurements are also consistent ( within the quoted errors ) with a constant value .",
    "although the result may very well be real , it is certainly not statistically significant at this time .",
    "moreover , we question the premise of collin et al .  that the best measure of line width is the one that minimizes changes in @xmath28 .",
    "rather , since the blr geometry really does change with @xmath54 , one should calibrate different @xmath28 values for different average line shapes , when sufficient statistics exist to do so in a robust fashion .",
    "collin et al .",
    "present an additional piece of information that we believe favors use of the fwhm over @xmath116 . because they are using reverberation - mapped agns , many epochs of observations are available .",
    "one may derive a so - called rms spectrum that isolates the variable part of the line . as argued in , e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , it is preferable to measure the width of the variable component of the line , which hopefully reflects the kinematics of gas at the measured radii .",
    "as it turns out , the fwhm measured from the mean and rms spectra are more self - consistent than the respective @xmath116 measurements .",
    "there appears to be a very broad , non - variable component of the line which biases @xmath116 more strongly than fwhm ( perhaps an optically thin component ; e.g. ,  shields et al .",
    "while the very broad component can not be removed in single - epoch observations , at least the fwhm is less biased by it .",
    "finally , it is quite clear from figure 1 of collin et al .  that the scatter in @xmath116 measurements is considerably larger than in the fwhm .",
    "the same result was reported by greene & ho ( 2006 ) .",
    "* we use the radius - luminosity relation reported by bentz et al .",
    "note that this differs from greene & ho ( 2007b ) .",
    "* we use the fwhm to determine the gas velocity dispersion . * because we believe @xmath28 is not a constant , but rather depends on @xmath54 , and in order to facilitate comparison with the literature , we do not apply an @xmath28 correction but use the fiducial assumption of a spherical blr ( @xmath139 ; e.g. ,  netzer 1990 ) .",
    "obviously , virial masses remain highly uncertain , and potentially systematically biased .",
    "in addition to the many uncertainties highlighted above , it is not yet clear the degree to which the blr is a flattened structure , which means that inclination effects can not be properly accounted for , even in a statistical sense .",
    "we are hopeful that an increased sample of reverberation - mapped sources ( e.g. ,  kollatschny 2003 ) , combined with an increase in the number of measured @xmath29  measurements in agns , will decrease the outstanding systematic errors in these masses in the near future .",

    "<S> we present an expanded sample of low - mass black holes ( bhs ) found in galactic nuclei . using standard virial mass techniques to estimate bh masses , we select from the fourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey all broad - line active galaxies with masses @xmath0  @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> bhs in this mass regime provide unique tests of the relationship between bhs and galaxies , since their late - type galaxy hosts do not necessarily contain classical bulges . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they provide observational analogs of primordial seed bhs and are expected , when merging , to provide strong gravitational signals for future detectors such as _ lisa_. from our preliminary sample of 19 , we have increased the total sample by an order of magnitude to 174 , as well as an additional 55 ( less secure ) candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the sample has a median bh mass of @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4  @xmath1 , and in general the objects are radiating at high fractions of their eddington limits . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the broad spectral properties of the sample ; 55 are detected by _ rosat _ , with soft x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath5 to @xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 . much like the preliminary sample , these objects are predominantly radio - quiet ( _ r _  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 ) , but 11 objects are detected at 20 cm , with radio powers ( @xmath9 w  hz@xmath7 ) that may arise from either star formation or nuclear activity ; only @xmath10 of the sample is radio - loud . </S>",
    "<S> we further confirm that , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 mag , the host galaxies are low - mass , late - type systems . </S>",
    "<S> at least @xmath13 show disk - like morphologies , and the combination of host galaxy colors and higher - order balmer absorption lines indicate intermediate - age stellar populations in a subset of the sample . </S>"
