    "therefore , once the correction for dust scattering is introduced , we observe that the flux increases by @xmath82  % , the column density of neutral material is lower and the spectrum steepens . in particular , we observe the photon index to steepen by @xmath83 .",

    "the same applies also to the ir3 interval .",
