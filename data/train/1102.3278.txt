    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ? * ) , launched on june 11 , 2008 , is revolutionizing our view of the high energy @xmath8ray sky , thanks to its large collecting area and outstanding performance at energies above 1 gev .",
    "one of the most exciting results obtained by _",
    "fermi_-lat has been a factor of ten increase in the number of rotation powered pulsars ( psrs ) identified as @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "starting from a sample of 6 objects ( 5 radio pulsars and geminga , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a legacy of the egret experiment onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory , we have now more than 60 identified pulsars @xcite , divided into three sub - families : classical pulsars ( 27 sources ) , radio - quiet pulsars ( 22 sources ) and millisecond pulsars ( 14 sources ) .",
    "the existence of such population(s ) of gamma - ray pulsars offers a new view of the galactic neutron stars and opens new avenues for neutron star searches .",
    "while the wealth of detections confirms the importance of the @xmath0-ray channel in the overall energy budget of rotation - powered pulsars , it points to emission models in which the @xmath8ray production occurs in the outer magnetosphere along open - field lines ( outer gap / slot gap ) , paving the way for understanding the 3-d structure and dynamics of neutron star magnetospheres .",
    "the most important objects to constrain pulsar models are the `` extreme '' ones , accounting for the tails of the population distribution in energetics , age , magnetic field . in this respect , psr j0357 + 3205 is one of the most interesting pulsars discovered by lat .",
    "it is listed in the catalog of the 205 brightest sources compiled after 3 months of sky scanning @xcite , with a flux of @xmath9 ph @xmath7 s@xmath4 above 100 mev .",
    "the source is located off the galactic plane , at a latitude @xmath10 . a blind search allowed to unambiguously detect the timing signature of a pulsar , with p@xmath11 s and @xmath12 s s@xmath4 ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b ; see ray et al .",
    "2010 for the most updated timing parameters ) . the characteristic age of psr j0357 + 3205 ( @xmath13 yr ) is not outstanding among @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "the `` three musketeers '' ( geminga , psr b0656 + 14 , psr b1055 - 52 , see e.g. de luca et al . 2005 ) , have ages in the 115 - 550 kyr range and are prominent @xmath0-ray sources ( geminga and psr b1055 - 52 are known to pulsate in @xmath0-rays since the egret era ) .",
    "however , the spin - down luminosity of psr j0357 + 3205 is as low as @xmath14 erg s@xmath4 , which is almost an order of magnitude lower than that of the three musketeers .",
    "indeed , psr j0357 + 3205 is the non - recycled @xmath0-ray pulsar with the smallest rotational energy loss detected so far .",
    "this suggests psr j0357 + 3205 to be rather close to us : by scaling its @xmath8ray flux using the so - called @xmath0-ray `` pseudo - distance '' relation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a distance of @xmath15 pc is inferred .",
    "psr j0357 + 3205 shows that even mature pulsars with a rather low spin - down luminosity can sustain copious , energetic particle acceleration in their magnetosphere , channelling a large fraction of their rotational energy loss in gamma rays .",
    "thus , it stands out as a powerful testbed for pulsar models .    in view of its plausible proximity , psr j0357 + 3205 is a natural target for x - ray observations .",
    "the lack of any plausible counterpart in 7 ks archival swift / xrt data coupled with the quite large uncertainty in the position of the @xmath0-ray pulsar available in an earlier phase of the _ fermi _ mission ( @xmath16 arcmin , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) called for deep x - ray and optical observations in order to identify the pulsar counterpart as an x - ray source with a high x - ray to optical flux ratio .",
    "this requires ( i ) a deep x - ray observation with sharp angular resolution to nail down the position of faint x - ray sources with sub - arcsec accuracy and ( ii ) a sensitive multicolor optical coverage of the x - ray sources detected inside the @xmath8ray error circle .",
    "this second step is crucial to reject unrelated field sources such as stars or extragalactic objects . to this aim , in 2009 , we were granted of a joint chandra ( 80 ks ) and noao program ( 4 hr in the v band and 3 hr in the ks band at the kitt peak north mayall 4 m telescope ) .",
    "we also made use of optical images in the b , r and i bands collected at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the la palma observatory ( canary islands ) in 2010 as a part of an international time programme aimed at a first follow - up of _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray pulsars ( shearer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    in this paper",
    ", we describe our observations , which yielded the x - ray counterpart of the pulsar as well as the detection of a huge extended feature apparently linked to it .",
    "our chandra observation of psr j0357 + 3205 was split between two consecutive satellite revolutions .",
    "the first observation started on 25 october 2009 at 00:56 ut and lasted 29.5 ks ; the second observation started on 26 october 2009 and lasted 47.1 ks .",
    "the two observations are almost co - aligned , with very similar pointing directions and satellite roll angles .",

    "the time resolution of the observation is 3.2 s. the vfaint exposure mode was adopted .",
    "we retrieved `` level 1 '' data from the chandra x - ray center science archive and we generated `` level 2 '' event files using the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao v.4.2 ) software .",
    "we also produced a combined event file using the _ merge_all _ script .",
    "deep optical and near infrared images of the field of psr j0357 + 3205 were collected at the 4 m mayall telescope at kitt peak north national observatory as a part of our joint chandra - noao program .",

    "in order to identify the x - ray counterpart of the @xmath8ray pulsar , we searched the most recent _ fermi_-lat timing error circle for x - ray sources showing the expected signature of isolated neutron stars , i.e. a very high x - ray to optical flux ratio .",

    "such limit can be compared to the bolometric luminosity of the well studied surface thermal emission of the three musketeers , which have a characteristic age similar to that of our target . the upper limit to the thermal emission from psr j0357 + 3205 is a factor of 10 lower than the bolometric luminosity of psr b0656 + 14 and psr b1055 - 52 smaller luminosity . ] @xcite , but it is comparable to the luminosity of geminga @xcite . although psr j0357 + 3205 turns out to be the coldest neutron star in its age range ( 0.1 - 1 myr ) , the upper limit to its thermal emission is consistent with the expectations of several cooling models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the apparent lack of emission from the polar caps is also interesting , since psr j0357 + 3205 is a bright @xmath0-ray pulsar , channelling about 40% of its spin - down luminosity in @xmath0-rays of magnetospheric origin and thus polar cap re - heating by `` return currents '' in the magnetosphere would be expected .",

    "the upper limit is a factor of a few lower than the luminosity expected by heating models based on return currents of e@xmath121/e@xmath122 generated above the polar caps by curvature radiation photons , but it is consistent with expectations for polar cap heating due to bombardment by particles created only by inverse compton scattered photons @xcite . psr j0357 + 3205 is close to the death line for production of e@xmath121/e@xmath122 by curvature radiation photons @xcite , which could explain the reduced polar cap heating . as a further possibility , the system s viewing geometry could play some role , as in the case of geminga , where the emitting area and luminosity of the thermally emitting polar cap suggested an almost aligned rotator , seen at high inclination angle @xcite .    when compared to other well - known middle - aged rotation - powered pulsars , the x - ray spectrum of psr j0357 + 3205 is remarkably different .",
    "indeed , it is reminiscent of a number of _ older _ ( @xmath123 yr ) pulsars , such as , e.g. , psr b1929 + 10 @xcite , b1133 + 16 @xcite , b0943 + 10 @xcite , b0628 + 28 @xcite .",
    "a non thermal origin for the bulk of the x - ray emission from such pulsars was proposed by @xcite , although such a picture was questioned , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite , who preferred a composite , thermal plus non - thermal spectral model .",
    "the morphology of the tail , apparently protruding from psr j0357 + 3205 and smoothly connected to the pulsar counterpart strongly argues for a physical association of the two systems .",
    "this is also supported by the lack of any other source possibly related to the extended feature .",
    "sources `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' are extragalactic objects .",
    "an interpretation of the feature as an agn jet , associated e.g. to source 2 , can be safely discarded , owing to the lack of radio emission for both the point source and the diffuse feature , at variance with all known agn jets @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the angular extent of the feature would imply an unrealistic physical size , unless the source is quite local ( a huge 200 kpc - long jet would imply an angular scale distance of order 80 mpc , assuming standard cosmological parameters ) , which would call for a rich multiwavelength phenomenology ( the host galaxy itself  with an angular scale well in excess of 1 arcmin  should be clearly resolved in our ground - based optical images ) .",
    "assuming an association of the feaure to psr j0357 + 3205 , the observed extension of the tail , at a distance of 500 pc , would correspond to a physical length of @xmath124 pc ( assuming no inclination with respect to the plane of the sky ) .",
    "a few elongated `` tails '' of x - ray emission associated to rotation - powered pulsars have been discovered by @xcite .",
    "such features are interpreted within the framework of bow - shock , ram - pressure dominated , pulsar wind nebulae ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "if the pulsar moves supersonically , shocked pulsar wind is expected to flow in an elongated region downstream of the termination shock ( basically , the cavity in the interstellar medium created by the moving neutron star and its wind ) , confined by ram pressure .",
    "x - ray emission is due to synchrotron emission from the wind particles accelerated at the termination shock , which is typically seen ( if angular resolution permits ) as the brightest portion of the extended structure ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as expected from mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "although for our radio - quiet pulsar we have no information about the proper motion , the bow - shock pwn scenario would seem the most natural explanation . of course",
    ", such a picture would suggest for psr j0357 + 3205 a large space velocity aligned with the tail , in the direction opposite to the tail extension .",
    "if this is the case , the pulsar would be moving almost parallel to the plane of the galaxy , which would suggest that it was born out of the galactic plane , at an height of order 140@xmath125 pc ( where @xmath125 is the distance to the pulsar in units of 500 pc ) , possibly from a `` runaway '' high mass star @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the tail in the 0.5 - 10 kev energy range ( assuming d=500 pc ) is @xmath126 erg s@xmath4 , corresponding to a fraction @xmath127 of the pulsar spin - down luminosity .",
    "indeed , such value is fully compatible with that measured for other pulsars , which channel into their tails @xmath128 of their rotational energy loss .",
    "synchrotron cooling of the particles injected at the termination shock induces a significant softening of the emission spectrum as a function of the distance from the pulsar in bow - shock pwne . for the tail of psr j0357",
    "+ 3205 we do not have firm evidence for such a spectral variation . however , explaining the tail of psr j0357 + 3205 within the bow - shock pwn frame is not straightforward .",
    "a first difficulty arises from energetic requirements for the emitting particles  indeed , the hypothesis that the observed x - rays from the tail are due to synchrotron emission is somewhat challenging for a pulsar with such a low @xmath113 . as in the case of psr b1929 + 10 , discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the problem lies with the maximum energy of the particles injected in the pwn .",
    "particle acceleration mechanisms in pwne are not yet fully understood . the maximum energy to",
    "which electrons can be accelerated ( via acceleration of the pulsar wind and then re - acceleration at the termination shock ) is expected to be a fraction of the polar cap potential ( @xmath129 for the crab , see de jager et al.1996 ; see also de jager & djannati - ata 2008 , bandiera 2008 ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the maximum potential drop between the pole and the light cylinder ( in an aligned pulsar ) is @xmath130 . for psr j0357",
    "+ 3205 , this would correspond to electron acceleration in the pulsar magnetosphere up to a maximum lorentz factor @xmath131 , which can be considered as an upper limit for the electrons injected in the pwn .",
    "the characteristic energy of synchrotron photons is @xmath132 kev , where @xmath133 is the ambient magnetic field in units of 10 @xmath134 and @xmath135 is the lorentz factor of the radiating electrons in units of @xmath136 .",
    "it is clear that , in order to produce bright emission at few kev , the typical lorentz factor of the electrons in the tail has to be of the same order of @xmath137 , implying the presence of e@xmath138/e@xmath139 accelerated at the highest possible energy , as well as an ambient magnetic field as high as @xmath140 @xmath134 . if this is the case , it is possible to estimate the synchrotron cooling time of the emitting electrons as @xmath141 yr . coupling such value with the estimated physical length of the feature yields an estimate of the bulk flow speed of the emitting particles of @xmath142 km s@xmath4 , assuming no inclination w.r.t .",
    "the plane of the sky .",
    "such a value is consistent with results for other bow - shock pwne @xcite .",
    "a second difficulty for the bow - shock interpretation arises owing to the lack of diffuse emission surrounding the pulsar .",
    "bright emission from the wind termination shock should be seen there as the maximun surface brightness portion of the diffuse feature , as observed in all other known cases ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a possible way out , we evaluate under what conditions the termination shock could be unresolved by chandra .",
    "assuming standard relations @xcite , the distance between the pulsar and the head of the termination shock is expected to be @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the ambient density and @xmath145 is the pulsar space velocity . for psr j0357 + 3205 , @xmath146 cm , where @xmath147 is the pulsar space velocity in units of 100 km s@xmath4 and @xmath148 is the ambient number density in units of 1/@xmath149 . at a distance of 500 pc , this corresponds to @xmath150 .",
    "the surface of the termination shock ( in the hypothesis of an isotropic pulsar wind ) should assume an elongated shape , extending @xmath151 ( @xmath152 at 500 pc ) behind the pulsar .",
    "the termination shock could hide within the point spread function of the pulsar if @xmath153 , which would require an unrealistically large ambient number density ( of order several hundreds per @xmath149 ) , and/or a pulsar space velocity of at least 1000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "anisotropies in the pulsar wind could also play some role .",
    "such a picture would suggest that a significant fraction of the flux of the point source is due to emission from the wind termination shock .    a further problem with the bow - shock picture is related to the brightness profile of the tail , which is remarkably different from what is observed for all other diffuse structures interpreted as ram - pressure dominated pwn .",
    "figures 3 and 4 clearly show that the surface brightness grows as a function of angular distance from psr j0357 + 3205 and reaches a broad maximum @xmath154 away from the pulsar , while all the elongated structures imaged so far have their peak close to their parent pulsar position ( althougn localized , bright `` blobs '' along the tails have been observed , see e.g. kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 , and interpreted as due to kink instabilities in the particle flow ) . invoking geometric effects , such as bending of the tail along the line of sight ,",
    "producing limb brightening ( higher column density of emitting particles ) would require ad - hoc assumptions for the tail 3-d structure .",
    "since no plausible explanations for the origin of such bending are apparent , we discard such a possibility",
    ". lack of any significant spectral evolution along the tail ultimately prevents us from drawing conclusions on the physical nature of its peculiar profile .",
    "the `` asymmetric '' brightness profile of the tail in the direction perpendicular to its main axis ( with its sharp north - eastern edge and its shallower decay towards south - west ) is also remarkably different from what is observed for any other diffuse structure interpreted as ram - pressure dominated pwn , but is reminiscent of the case of the peculiar diffuse x - ray feature associated to psr b2224 + 65 , powering the `` guitar '' nebula @xcite .",
    "the extended feature seen there is remarkably misaligned ( by @xmath155 ) wrt .",
    "the direction of the pulsar proper motion @xcite and therefore it has been interpreted in a different frame , either as a `` magnetically - confined '' pwn @xcite , or as a jet from the pulsar @xcite .",
    "both pictures naturally predict the feature to be brighter in the leading edge ( the one in the direction of the proper motion ) , where `` fresh '' electrons are injected . the profile in the trailing edge is expected to fade smoothly , dominated by cooling of the electrons deposited by the moving source (",
    "i.e. the feature is a `` synchrotron wake '' along its minor axis ) .",
    "thus , if this is the case , the proper motion of the pulsar should not be aligned with the tail main axis and the tail itself should display a proper motion . in view of the lack of information about the pulsar proper motion , it is premature to discuss such scenarii any more .",
    "we note , however , that both pictures are not free from difficulties .",
    "for instance , the jet explanation can not easily explain the lack of any appreciable bending of the structure due to ram pressure from the ism .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetically confined pwn would require a very intense ( 50 @xmath156 g ) , ordered ambient magnetic field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for further details on such pictures for the case of psr b2224 + 65 )",
    ". moreover , the broad maximum at a large distance from the pulsar would not be accounted for easily in these pictures ( which , similarly to the bow - shock picture , predict a brightness peak close to the pulsar ) .",
    "we have detected the faint x - ray counterpart of the middle - aged , @xmath0-ray only , pulsar psr j0357 + 3205 , together with an associated , elongated feature of diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the pulsar emission is consistent with a purely magnetospheric , non - thermal origin .",
    "future deep x - ray observations will allow to better constrain the interstellar absorption ( consistent with a distance of a few hundred parsecs ) and possibly to detect pulsations .",
    "as for the case of the @xmath0-ray only pulsar in the cta-1 supernova remnant @xcite , this could unveil the presence of thermal emission from rotating hot spots , possibly associated to polar cap reheating by magnetospheric currents .",
    "the diffuse feature is @xmath157 arcmin long ( to our knowledge , considering its angular extension , this is the largest `` tail '' of x - ray emission so far associated to a rotation - powered pulsar ) and displays a hard , non - thermal spectrum .",
    "the nature of such feature can not be firmly established .",
    "a crucial piece of information could come from the pulsar proper motion . in this respect ,",
    "if the lack of a discernible pulsar wind termination shock is indeed due to a very high pulsar velocity ( @xmath158 km s@xmath4 ) , at a distance of 500 pc this would translate to a proper motion of @xmath159 yr@xmath4 , a value which is within the reach of chandra , even with a short time baseline ( @xmath160 yr ) .",
    "we note that precise timing of lat photons is not expected to be sensitive to the proper motion of psr j0357 + 3205 ( ray et al .",
    "2010 estimated that timing based on 5 years of lat data will yield a positional accuracy of @xmath161 ) . a proper motion aligned with the tail main axis would point to a bow - shock pwn interpretation , which will have , in any case , to face difficulties related to the energetics of the emitting particles as well as to the peculiar brightness profile .",
    "conversely , a proper motion misaligned with respect to the tail axis would point to a `` guitar''-like system , to be interpreted as a magnetically confined pwn or as a pulsar jet . in such a case , proper motion of the tail itself could be detected .",
    "a further check on the tail nature could come from deep x - ray observations , which could allow to detect spectral steepening in its emission , possibly shedding light on the geometry of the injection of particles in the nebula and pointing either to the bow - shock scenario , or to the guitar - like picture .",
    "a long xmm observation , recently granted , will clarify the spectral behaviour of the pulsar as well as of its record long tail .",
