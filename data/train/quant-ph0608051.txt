    "quantum information and condensed matter physics are currently two areas of very active research where several links between the two branches have been discovered in recent years . in particular",
    ", the relation of entanglement properties to critical points of quantum phase transitions has been studied in some detail . in analogy to classical phase transitions , the latter are typically characterized in terms of the scaling behavior of equilibrium properties , such as the correlation length .",
    "analogous scaling phenomena have now been found for the entanglement properties of a spin chain in the vicinity of a critical point . @xcite .    in quantum communication ,",
    "condensed matter systems have recently received some attention as interesting candidates for quantum channels @xcite .",
    "this approach may be of advantage in situations where photonic quantum communication is not possible for example because the two units are only separated by a few optical wavelengths or are inside a material that does not permit for the well - controlled propagation of light .",
    "the quantum mechanical properties of correlated many body system are to some extent determined by the energetic gap between their ground states and the lowest excited states .",
    "in particular the system is short range correlated if it features a finite gap , while some quantities can become long range correlated when the gap closes @xcite .",
    "the latter happens at the critical points of quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "motivated by these findings the dynamical entanglement properties of quantum many body systems undergoing a quantum phase transition are receiving increasing attention @xcite .    to pursue the analysis of quantum many body systems as possible quantum channels a step further , we study here the connection between the spectral gap and the systems ability to transfer excitations and entanglement .",
    "however , our aim is twofold : besides being interested in the systems transfer capacity , we also want to explore , to what degree the transfer properties can be employed to detect and characterize critical points of quantum phase transitions .    in particular , we consider spin chains and harmonic chains , where in both cases , two ancillas couple weakly to the chain at distant sites .",
    "we study the transfer of quantum information and excitations from one ancilla to the other numerically , by employing newly developed matrix product state techniques @xcite , and analytically with a master equation approach .",
    "the numerics is applied to the spin chains while the master equation is used to describe the case of an harmonic chain , where its validity is confirmed numerically for gaussian initial states @xcite .",
    "both systems show a very similar behavior : the transfer properties sensitively depend on the energy gap between the ground state and the lowest excited states , but do not significantly dependent on the detailed structure of the hamiltonian .",
    "the quality and speed of state transfer through such systems may thus be used to detect critical points experimentally .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii begins with a discussion of spin chains , mainly employing numerical methods .",
    "in section iii a simplified picture unraveling the origin of the observed behavior is presented .",
    "this picture is then further corroborated in section iv where we study harmonic chains both numerically and analytically with a master equation approach .",
    "section v discusses connection to quantum channel capacities and section vi summarizes our results .",
    "a variety of quantum spin chains exhibit quantum phase transitions .",
    "therefore we begin with the study of a linear chain of spins with nearest neighbor interactions and open boundary conditions described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the number of spins , @xmath2 a magnetic field and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 the interaction between neighboring spins .",
    "two ancilla systems ( named @xmath6 for `` sender '' and @xmath7 for `` receiver '' ) couple to the chain at spins @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are near the center of the chain in order to avoid boundary effects .",
    "the total hamiltonian of chain and ancillas then reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the zeeman splitting of the ancillas , which might differ from @xmath2 , and @xmath12 the coupling of the ancillas to the chain , which is taken to be weak , i.e. @xmath13 . as an initial state of the system we consider @xmath14 i.e. the sender is spin up and the receiver is spin down , while the chain is in its ground state , @xmath15 .",
    "this will allow us to explore the propagation of this excitation through the chain .",
    "the dynamics is simulated with a matrix product state technique using matrices of dimension @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the simulations was confirmed by varying the matrix dimension and the size of the time steps .",
    "furthermore , we confirmed that the dynamics conserves the total energy of the system .",

    "if the spectral gap is larger than the zeeman splitting of the ancillas ( left plot ) it is not possible to create a real excitation of the chain , only processes involving virtual excitations of the chain are then permitted and the excitation will be almost completely transferred from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "if however the spectral gap is smaller than the zeeman splitting of the ancillas , real excitations may be created in the chain .",

    ", we now turn to a different model for the chain which also features an adjustable energy gap above its unique ground state .",
    "harmonic chains whose time evolution is governed by a hamiltonian that is quadratic in position and momentum can be solved exactly in a compact form and therefore lend themselves to analytical investigations .",
    "furthermore , gaussian initial states , ie states whose wigner function is a gaussian , preserve their gaussian character under the time evolution . as a gaussian",
    "is fully described by its first and second moments this allows for a very compact , polynomial in the number of oscillators , description of the state of the systems and its evolution in time ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) , which permits the numerical investigation of very large systems .",

    "if the distance @xmath127 is a multiple of half that wavelength , a wave that has high amplitude next to @xmath6 will have high amplitude next to @xmath7 , too .",

    "the standard procedure to diagonalize say the transverse ising chain is a jordan wigner transformation followed by fourier and bogoliubov transformations @xcite .",
    "this procedure however only diagonalizes the subspace of odd or even number of excitations at a time but not both . since the operator @xmath142 maps between the odd to the even number subspaces for any @xmath143 , an exact expression for the time dependent correlation functions @xmath144 , which would be required for deriving a master equation , can not be obtained via the above procedure @xcite .",
    "if one uses only say the even excitation number subspace as an approximation , the errors for the obtained eigenvalues scale as @xmath145 , where @xmath1 is the length of the chain .",
    "it is therefore often argued that only using one subspace is a good approximation for long chains .    in our problem",
    ", this reasoning can not be applied : an approximation of the required correlation functions , @xmath144 , by only considering one subspace leads to unphysical results for the master equation .",

    "quantum spin chains may be used as quantum channels . here",
    "we have studied the dependence of the transfer quality and speed on the size of the spectral gap between the ground and the lowest excited state of the considered system .",
    "two different scenarios are observed : provided the spectral gap of the chain is larger than the amount of energy initially located in the sender , close to perfect transfer happens on rather long time scales .",
    "the transfer becomes even more perfect but slower if the coupling strength between ancillas and chain or the energy initially in the sender is lowered further .",
    "if the energy in the sender is initially larger than the spectral gap , the behavior changes significantly . here ,",
    "the excitations get lost into the chain implying a bad transfer quality .",
    "this second scenario takes place on much shorter time scales than the first one .",
    "these results may be used for two main applications : for quantum information purposes , they show , that by using a system with a large enough spectral gap one can build good quantum channels .",
    "these channels are furthermore considerably robust against decoherence because the chain remains to a high precision in its ground state which is not significantly affected by an environment at zero temperature .    in condensed matter physics , on the other hand",
    ", the transfer speed and quality can be used to infer the size of the spectral gap and hence the location of quantum critical points .",
    "this method is admittedly inferior to neutron scattering in magnetic composites , but it may by advantageous in optical lattices where neutron scattering is not that successfull .",
