    "the extensions of the standard model ( sm ) have been intensively studied over the past years@xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most attractive ones among the general extended models of the sm . in the usual mssm",
    "the r - parity is conserved . here",
    "the r - parity is defined as @xmath4 we can see that the lepton - number or baryon - number violating interactions can induce r - parity violation ( @xmath5 ) . in the usual supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "extension models , r - parity conservation @xcite is imposed due to two reasons .",
    "one is to retain the electroweak gauge invariance of the sm .",
    "the other is to solve the proton decay problem , since the r - parity violation leads to unacceptable short proton lifetime .",
    "but the most general susy extension of the sm should contain r - parity violating interactions . until now",
    "have we been lacking in credible theoretical argument and experimental tests for @xmath6 conservation , so we can say that the @xmath6 violation would be equally well motivated in the supersymmetric extension of the sm . up to now we have experimentally only some upper limits on @xmath5 parameters .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to continue the work on finding @xmath5 signal or getting further stringent constraints on the @xmath5 parameters in future experiments .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical works have demonstrated that the dilepton production processes in hadron collisions ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 ) , are very important @xcite , since there is a continuous c.m.s energy distribution of the colliding partons inside protons(and anti - protons ) at hadron colliders .",
    "these dilepton production channels at hadron colliders can be used to study the parton distribution functions(pdfs ) at small x values @xcite @xcite , to determine the @xmath10 mass @xcite @xcite @xcite , and to extract the effective weak mixing angle@xcite and the information on the width of the @xmath10 boson @xcite @xcite, ... etc .",
    "the most attractive purpose is that at the c.m.s hadron colliding energy region beyond the @xmath11 , one can probe the new physics beyond the sm , such as large extra dimensions @xcite @xcite , extra neutral gauge bosons@xcite , r - parity violation@xcite and composite quarks and leptons@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that at the upgrade fermilab tevatron run ii with integrate luminosity 2 - 20@xmath12 at @xmath13 and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) with 100@xmath12 at @xmath14 , it would be possible to extract the new physics effects beyond the sm by investigating the dilepton production processes .    the dilepton pairs can be produced via the drell - yan subprocess and gluon fusion at hadron colliders .",
    "the analysis of the sensitivity to @xmath5 couplings in measurement on the drell - yan production processes @xmath15 at the lhc was studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "but we suppose that the process @xmath16 could be important too due to the large gluon luminosity in hadron colliders , although the dilepton pair production via gluon fusion is an one - loop process .",
    "if we set the values of the r - parity violating parameters concerned to be near the corresponding upper limits@xcite , we can see that the major r - parity effects on cross section of subprocess @xmath17 come from the loops involving the third generation quarks .",
    "then we would have the conclusion that the cross section of @xmath18 is approximately proportional to @xmath19 ( @xmath20 are the generation indices of the sneutrino and dilepton , respectively ) . from the experimental constraints of @xmath5 parameters@xcite",
    ", we have the upper limitations on the related r - parity violating parameters : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "due to @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 .",
    "since the upper limitation of @xmath28 is much smaller than those of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the cross section of @xmath31 is approximately proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "and the cross section of @xmath33 is approximately proportional to @xmath34",
    ". then we can estimate that the cross section of @xmath35 may be several times larger than that of @xmath31 , if the related r - parity violating parameters have the values near the corresponding upper limits .    in this paper we concentrated on finding the effects of r - parity lepton number violating mssm in the @xmath2 pair production processes via both drell - yan and gluon fusion subprocesses at the cern lhc . in section",
    "ii we present the relevant model and the calculation of the processes @xmath36 .",
    "analytical calculation is presented in section ii .",
    "numerical results and discussion are given in section iii , where the cross sections in the minimal standard supersymmetric models with and without r - parity violation will be compared . in section",
    "iv we give a short summary .",
    "in this section we review briefly the mssm with r - parity lepton number violation .",
    "all renormalizable supersymmetric @xmath37 interactions can be introduced in the superpotential .",

    "for presentation of the @xmath110 effect of the process @xmath111 , we define @xmath110 parameter @xmath112 as : @xmath113",

    "only five sypersymmetric parameters should be given which are named @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , sign of @xmath125 and @xmath126 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the universal gaugino mass , scalar mass at gut scale and the trilinear soft breaking parameter in the superpotential respectively . as we know that the effects of the r - parity violating couplings on the renormalization group equations(rge s ) are the crucial ingredient of msugra - type models , and the complete 2-loop rge s of the superpotential parameters for the supersymmetric standard model including the full set of r - parity violating couplings are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "but in our numerical presentation to get the low energy scenario from the msugra @xcite , we ignored those effects in the rge s for simplicity and use the program isajet 7.44 . in this program",
    "the rge s @xcite are run from the weak scale @xmath127 up to the gut scale , taking all thresholds into account and using two loop rge s only for the gauge couplings and the one - loop rge s for the other supersymmetric parameters .",
    "the gut scale boundary conditions are imposed and the rge s are run back to @xmath128 , again taking threshold into account .",
    "the r - parity violating parameters chosen above satisfy the constraints given by ref.@xcite .",
    "we take the msugra input parameters as : @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath134 will be running in a definite range .",
    "the ratio of @xmath135 decay width to its mass is taken as @xmath136 .",
    "ref.@xcite presents the experimental constraints for the coupling parameters in r - parity violating interactions . according to these upper limitations ,",
    "we take the relevant r - violating coupling parameters @xmath137 having the values as @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 and all of the others @xmath141 which we will use in calculation are chosen to be 0.25 . for the related coupling parameters",
    "@xmath142 , we know that the first two indices of parameters @xmath142 are antisymmetric , then the @xmath142 should be zero when @xmath143 .",
    "the others concerned @xmath110 coupling parameters @xmath144 and @xmath145 are taken to be -0.18 .",
    "the cross section of the subprocess @xmath146 , @xmath147 as a function of @xmath91 is given in fig.5 .",
    "we can see there is a peck around the vicinity of the @xmath148 on the curve for the @xmath110-mssm .",
    "since the energy of this subprocess @xmath91 from incoming protons has a continuous spectrum , it can be estimated that the total cross section and the @xmath110 effects of @xmath149 will be greatly enhanced at hadron colliders .",
    "the cross section of subprocess @xmath150 in @xmath110-mssm as a function of the c.m.s .",
    "energy of colliding gluons is depicted in fig.6 .",
    "again we can see the resonance enhancement from @xmath135 exchanging s - channel at the energy position around @xmath148 .",
    "because of the much larger luminosity of gluons in the parton distribution function of proton compared with that of quarks and anti - quarks , the subprocess @xmath33 would contribute to the total cross section of @xmath151 at the lhc to some extent .",
    "fig.7 gives the total cross section of the process @xmath152 as the function of the lower cut value of the @xmath2 pair invariant mass @xmath153 . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the @xmath110 effect on the production rate of @xmath154 pair is rather large , and gluon fusion subprocess plays a significant role .",
    "now we use the parameter @xmath112 , which is defined in eq.(3.15 ) , to represent the effect of @xmath110 of parent process @xmath155 , and we further denote the @xmath110 effect parameters @xmath156 , which correspond to the parent processes in which the @xmath110 effect is contributed by the drell - yan mechanism , gluon fusion and both subprocesses , respectively . in fig.8 , we depicted the r - violating effect @xmath112 as a function of universal scalar mass at gut scale @xmath123 , which is related to the mass of supersymmetric neutrino @xmath135 .",
    "from fig.8 we know that effect of r - parity lepton number violating on @xmath2-pair production at the lhc is rather large , especially in the @xmath123 range when @xmath157 .",
    "the effect parameter of r - parity violation @xmath158 , which describes the @xmath110 effect for process",
    "@xmath159 , may be over the value of 70@xmath160 .",
    "we can see also from fig.8 that the most part of the r - parity violating effect is contributed by the drell - yan subprocess , but the part contributed by gluon fusion subprocess @xmath150 is also significant .",
    "fig.9 shows the ratio of the r - parity violating effects contributed by gluon fusion and drell - yan subprocesses , as a function of universal scalar mass at gut scale(@xmath123 ) .",
    "we can see that the smaller the scalar mass @xmath123 is , the more contributions to @xmath110 effects via subprocess @xmath33 are .",
    "when @xmath161 , the contribution to @xmath110 effects from gluon fusion can reach approximately 25@xmath160 of that from drell - yan subprocess .",
    "fig.10 shows the dependence of the ratio of the @xmath37 effects via gluon fusion and drell - yan mechanism subprocesses on the value of @xmath162 .",
    "it demonstrates that the ratio @xmath163 is strongly related to the r - parity violating parameters @xmath164 .",
    "the larger @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , the more important the contribution to the @xmath37 effect via subprocess @xmath33 is . from fig.8 , fig.9 and fig.10",
    ", we can conclude that although the gluon fusion subprocess @xmath165 has no tree - level feynman diagram , its contribution to @xmath110 effect is also significant comparing to that via drell - yan subprocess in some parameter space of the mssm with r - parity violating .",
    "the reason are in two fields : firstly , it is due to the large gluon luminosity in hadron collider . secondly , in the loop - order feynman diagrams for gluon fusion subprocess , there exist the r - parity lepton number violation interactions involving the third generation particles . while the experimental upper limitations of these coupling strengths@xcite are much larger than those , their interacting particles involving only the members of the first two generations .",
    "we studied the effects of the r - parity lepton number violation in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) on the parent process @xmath155 at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the contribution from the one - loop induced gluon fusion subprocess @xmath150 , may contribute to r - parity violating effect significantly in comparing with that via drell - yan subprocess .",
    "so in studying the effect of r - parity lepton number violation on @xmath2-pair production process , we should figure out the contributions both from drell - yan subprocess @xmath166 and gluon fusion subprocess @xmath167 .",
    "our calculation shows that the r - parity lepton number violating effect from gluon fusion subprocess can reaches 30@xmath160 of the corresponding part via drell - yan subprocess .",
    "we find also that the dependences of r - violating effect on the sneutrino mass and the coupling strength of the r - parity violating interactions are obvious .",
