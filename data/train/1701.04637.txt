    "stochastic growth models of interfaces have been extensively studied along the years ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the most studied universality class of critical dynamics behavior of growing interfaces are the ones represented by the edward - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite and the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite models whose dynamical critical exponents are equal to 2 and @xmath3 , respectively . differently from these models , where the absorption and desorption processes are local , the raise and peel model ( rpm ) @xcite ,",
    "although keeping the adsorption process local , the desorption processes is nonlocal .",
    "this model is quite interesting , as it is the first example of an stochastic model with conformal invariance .",
    "the critical properties of the model depend on the parameter @xmath1 defined as the ratio among the adsorption and desorption rates . at @xmath4",
    "the rpm is special , being exact integrable and conformally invariant .",
    "the dynamical critical exponent has the value @xmath5 and its time - evolution operator ( hamiltonian ) is related to the xxz quantum chain with @xmath6-anisotropy @xmath7 ( razumov - stroganov point @xcite ) . for @xmath8 ( desorption rates greater than the adsorption ones ) the model is noncritical , but for @xmath9 the model is in a critical regime with continuously varying critical exponents @xmath10 , that decreases from @xmath11 ( conformally invariant ) to @xmath12 .",
    "the configurations of the growing surface in the rpm are formed by sites whose heights define dyck paths ( restricted solid - on - solid , rsos ) on a lattice with @xmath13 sites and open boundaries . in these surface configurations",
    "there are active sites where adsorption and desorption processes take place , and inactive sites where nothing happens during the time evolution .",
    "an interesting extension of the rpm at @xmath4 , proposed in @xcite , is the peak adjusted raise and peel model ( parpm ) . in this model",
    "an additional parameter @xmath14 that depends on the total number of inactive sites , controls the relative changes of a given configuration .",
    "the model at @xmath15 recovers the rpm .",
    "for @xmath16 the model is not exact integrable anymore but still is conformally invariant @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 in the parpm has a limiting value ( @xmath17 ) where the configuration with only inactive sites ( no adsorption or desorption ) become an absorbing state .",
    "surprisingly at this point , on spite of the presence of the absorbing state , that should be the true stationary state , the system stays in a quasi - stationary state during a time interval that grows exponentially with the system size @xcite .",
    "this quasi - stationary state has similar properties as the stationary states of the conformally invariant region @xmath18 .    motivated by this unusual and interesting behavior we introduce in this paper an extension of the parpm , where the parameter @xmath14 is extended so that when @xmath19 the number of absorbing states increases with the value of @xmath14 . the results presented in this paper shows that a quasi - stationary state , with similar properties as in the conformally invariant region @xmath18 , endures as the true stationary state even when the number of absorbing states is extensively large .",
    "only at @xmath20 the model undergoes a transition to one of the infinitely many absorbing states .    in order to check if this unusual behavior is linked to the conformal invariance of the model for @xmath18 we study the parpm in regions where @xmath21 , where the model is either gaped ( @xmath8 ) , or critical but not conformally invariant ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "the rpm although originally defined in an open chain can also be defined in a periodic lattice @xcite . in the periodic chain",
    "the model can be interpreted as a particular extension of the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) where the particles ( excluded volume ) are allowed to perform local as well nonlocal jumps .",
    "we are going also to consider in this paper the parpm formulated in periodic lattices .",
    "we verified that when @xmath29 ( only adsorption processes ) the extended parpm is exactly related to a totally asymmetric exclusion process ( tasep ) where the particles jumps only in one direction . at @xmath15 , where the model recovers the rpm , the model is mapped to the standard tasep @xcite , and for @xmath16 it can be interpreted as a tasep whose transition rate to the neighboring sites depend on the total number of particle - vacancy pairs , in the configuration .    at @xmath2 ( no adsorption ) the model is gapped but shows interesting properties .",
    "the configuration where there are no sites available for desorption is an absorbing state , since there is not adsorption process .",
    "although gapped the system stays during a large time , that increases polynomially with the lattice size , in a critical quasi - stationary state with dynamical critical exponent @xmath5 .",
    "this phenomena is due to the appearance of an extensive large number of jordan cells ( or jordan blocks ) , that for sufficiently large lattices produces a more important effect than the exponential decay induced by the gap .",
    "for some special initial conditions we are able to obtain analytically the jordan cells and derive the time dependence of some of the observables .",
