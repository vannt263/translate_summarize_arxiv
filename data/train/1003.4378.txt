    "the properties of @xmath2 and @xmath4 mesons should manifest themselves in production and decay processes and in their interaction with nuclear matter .",
    "these processes are being studied in experiments from threshold  @xcite through high - energy collisions where anomalously high branching ratios have been observed for @xmath9 and @xmath10-meson decays to an @xmath6 plus additional hadrons @xcite .    at the hadronic level",
    ", it is expected that the @xmath4 meson can be produced through the exchange and rescattering of mesons , through the excitation of an intermediate baryonic resonance or via the fusion of virtual mesons  @xcite .",
    "so far the @xmath11 process has been studied quantitatively only within ( i ) an effective lagrangian approach , assuming that the s@xmath12(1535 ) resonance is dominant  @xcite and ( ii ) within a covariant effective meson - nucleon theory including meson and nucleon currents with the nucleon resonances s@xmath12(1650 ) , p@xmath12(1710 ) and p@xmath13(1720 ) @xcite . however , for @xmath6 production there is an additional potential contribution where glue is excited in the `` short distance '' ( @xmath14-fm ) interaction region of the proton - nucleon collision and then evolves to become an @xmath6 in the final state . this gluonic contribution to the cross section for @xmath15 , proposed by bass @xcite ,",
    "is beyond the contributions associated with meson exchange models .",
    "there is no reason , a priori , to expect this ozi violating process to be small .",
    "because glue is flavor - blind it contributes with the same strength in both the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 reactions .",
    "it is not possible to establish the relative contributions of possible reaction mechanisms responsible for @xmath4-meson production based only on the presently available cross sections for the @xmath17 reaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has to investigate @xmath4 production as a function of spin and isospin degrees of freedom .",
    "such studies were conducted in the case of the @xmath2 meson  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath18 has been measured for quasifree @xmath2 production from a deuteron target up to 109 mev above threshold @xcite .",
    "one finds that @xmath19 is approximately energy independent with a value of @xmath20 in the energy range of @xmath21 mev signifying a strong isovector exchange contribution to the @xmath2 production mechanism .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 has not been measured to date , and the existing predictions differ drastically depending on the model .",
    "cao and lee  @xcite assumed , by analogy to the production of the @xmath2 meson , that the production of the @xmath4 meson proceeds dominantly via the s@xmath12(1535 ) resonance .",
    "as a consequence they predicted within an effective lagrangian approach an @xmath23 value equal to the experimentally established @xmath19 value . in contrast , kaptari and kmpfer  @xcite predicted a value of @xmath23 close to @xmath241.5 in the kinematic range of the cosy-11 experiment with the dominant contribution coming from the meson conversion currents . in the extreme scenario of glue - induced production saturating the @xmath4 production cross section , the ratio @xmath25 would approach unity after correction for the final - state interaction between the two outgoing nucleons .",
    "the su(3 ) wave functions of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 mesons differ due to iso - singlet gluonic and strangeness degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , it is reasonable that singlet currents will play a greater role in @xmath4 than in @xmath2 production .",
    "proton - proton data are available from cosy and saturne  @xcite .",
    "to investigate the production mechanism it is important to provide an empirical base with spin and isospin dependence of the cross sections . in this article",

    "a detailed description of the functioning of the detectors and of the experimental technique is given in a recent cosy-11 article devoted to measurement of the @xmath26 reaction  @xcite and in ref .",

    "the experiment is based on the registration of all outgoing nucleons from the @xmath27 reaction .",
    "the proton moving forward is measured in two drift chambers and scintillator detectors and the neutron is registered in the neutral particle detector .",
    "the proton moving backward is measured with a dedicated silicon - pad detector  @xcite . in the data analysis",
    "the backward proton from the deuteron is considered as a spectator that does not interact with the bombarding proton , but escapes untouched and hits the detector carrying the fermi momentum possessed at the time of the reaction .",
    "the total energy available for the quasifree proton - neutron reaction is calculated for each event based on the momentum vectors of the spectator and beam protons under the assumption that the spectator proton is on its mass shell at the moment of the collision .",
    "the absolute momentum of the neutron is determined from the time of flight between the target and the neutron detector and its direction is derived from the hit position defined as the center of the detection module whose signal was produced as the first one .     reaction .",
    "protons are registered in two drift chambers d1 and d2 and in the scintillator hodoscopes s1 and s3 .",
    "the s1 detector is built of 16 vertically arranged modules , whereas the s3 hodoscope is a nonsegmented scintillator wall viewed by a matrix of 217 photomultipliers .",
    "an array of silicon pad detectors ( spectator  detector ) is used for registration of spectator protons .",
    "neutrons are registered in the neutral particle detector consisting of 24 independent detection units . to distinguish neutrons from charged particles",
    "a veto detector is used .",

    "figure  [ banan_all_pads ] presents the momentum distribution of protons considered as spectators ( crosses ) compared with simulations taking into account a fermi motion of nucleons inside the deuteron ( solid line ) . in the analysis of the @xmath11 reaction spectator protons with momenta ranging from about 35 to about 115  mev / c were taken into account .",
    "the lower limit is caused by the noise level of the silicon pad detectors .",
    "the _ spectator noise cut _ was determined for each pad of the detector separately , using the spectra of energy loss triggered by a pulser with a frequency of 1  hz in addition to other experimental triggers .",
    "protons with a momentum larger than about 115  mev / c were not taken into account because we used the second layer of the double - layer spectator detector as a veto to reduce the background from charged pions .",
    "the shapes of the simulated and experimental spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ banan_all_pads ] agree quite well , and the small difference will be taken for the estimation of the systematical uncertainties of the final results caused by the assumption of a fermi momentum distribution of nucleons inside the deuteron .        the accuracy of the excess energy determination was estimated based on monte carlo simulations . for this purpose we simulated @xmath30 events of the @xmath11 reaction taking into account the fermi motion of the nucleons inside the deuteron , the size of the target  @xcite , the spread of the beam momentum and the horizontal and vertical beam size  @xcite .",
    "simulated data were analyzed in the same way as the experimental data , taking into consideration the energy and time resolution of the detectors , resulting in an excess energy resolution of @xmath31  mev .",
    "it is worth stressing that using this method for the @xmath32 reaction the standard deviation of the excess energy was derived to be @xmath33  mev  @xcite , which is comparable to the @xmath34  mev obtained under similar conditions at the promice / wasa setup  @xcite .    for further analysis",
    "the collected data were grouped according to the excess energy .",
    "the available range of excess energy @xmath35 above the @xmath4-meson production threshold has been divided into three 8  mev - wide intervals .",
    "the choice of the width of the interval is a compromise between statistics and resolution and reflects the accuracy ( fwhm ) of the determination of the excess energy . in figs  [ mm_da_q0_8](a ) ,",

    "for all distributions we observe an increase in counting rate toward the kinematical limit . the shape is mostly caused by the detector acceptance . a signal from the @xmath4-meson production",
    "is expected on top of the continuous multipion mass distribution at the position corresponding to the @xmath4 mass ( 0.95778  gev/@xmath39  @xcite , which is denoted by the arrow in fig .",
    "however , no enhancement around this region is seen .    to extract a signal",
    "the histograms corresponding to positive @xmath35 intervals were compared to the background established from the data below the threshold . for each distribution of the missing mass spectra at @xmath40 ,",
    "a corresponding background spectrum was constructed from events with @xmath35 belonging to the range @xmath41 $ ]  mev by applying the method described in detail in a dedicated article  @xcite .",
    "this method was already applied successfully to the analysis of the @xmath32 reaction  @xcite . as a cross - check , to gain more confidence in the applied procedure we constructed alternative background distributions taking events from the @xmath35 range from -20 to 0  mev .",
    "the result of this investigation has shown a consistency of both background shapes of the order of 1% .",
    "next , for each distribution for @xmath40 the corresponding background spectrum was normalised for mass values smaller than 0.25  gev/@xmath42 where no events from the @xmath4 meson are expected . in this",
    "region events correspond to one - pion production , for which the total cross section remains nearly constant in the range of the excess energy shown , because for a single - pion production the excess energy is high above the threshold  @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ mm_da_q0_8 ] depict the background spectrum , shifted to the kinematical limit and normalized accordingly .",
    "the normalization in the missing mass range significantly below the mass of the @xmath4 meson ( in the range from 0.75 to 0.85  gev/@xmath42 ) leads to the same result .",

    "we also took into account the systematic error ( @xmath46  @xcite ) originating from the luminosity determination .",
    "the nuclear `` shadow effect '' ( estimated to about 4.5%  @xcite ) was not taken into account because the reduction of the beam flux seen by the neutron , owing to the shielding by a spectator proton , is expected to be the same for the @xmath11 reaction and quasielastic scattering that was used for determination of the luminosity .",
    "similarly we have neglected the effect owing to the reabsorption of the produced meson by the spectator proton , because even for the case of @xmath2-meson production this effect reduces the cross section by a factor of about 3%  @xcite and the proton-@xmath2 interaction is much stronger than the proton-@xmath4 interaction  @xcite .",

    "<S> the upper limit of the total cross section for the @xmath0 reaction has been determined near the kinematical threshold in the excess energy range from 0 to 24  mev . </S>",
