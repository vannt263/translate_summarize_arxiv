    "grand unified theories have been used for a long time as a very elegant framework of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . while they are tightly constrained by limits on the proton decay lifetime and by the requirement of gauge coupling unification ,",
    "grand unified models are typically quite complicated and hard to test .",
    "the existence of non - zero neutrino masses and mixings has brought new experimental evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "understanding the neutrino properties in grand unified theories comes rather naturally through the see - saw mechanism , where integrating out large masses leads to the appearance of small masses .",
    "there are three types of see - saw models that can provide an understanding of the neutrino phenomenology : type i see - saw models require the existence of sm singlets that have dirac yukawa couplings to sm leptons ; type ii see - saw models use an @xmath1 scalar triplet with majorana type couplings to sm leptons ; type iii models couple a fermionic @xmath1 triplet to sm leptons though a dirac yukawa type coupling . while naturally explaining many observed features , the main challenge when building grand unified models and specific types of embedding the see - saw mechanism within these is to find the means for testing the validity of such models .",
    "naturally , a lot of effort has been directed towards building `` minimal '' models , where `` minimal '' has been understood in many different ways , but always with the goal of introducing a small number of unknowns in order to keep the theory predictive and testable . in this paper",
    "we discuss a highly constrained , testable @xmath0 model and its possible consequences .",
    "it is based on a small set of `` minimal '' requirements : renormalizability , the absence of any other matter fields besides those already present in the standard model and consistency with all present experimental data .",
    "together with group theoretical considerations , these requirements uniquely determine the model and its implications .",
    "we introduce the model in section [ scalars ] and discuss how it addresses the required symmetry breaking , generation of fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "the model has built - in a type ii mechanism for neutrino mass generation and it contains a number of interesting scalars , including two electroweak doublets and two electroweak triplets .    in section [ protondecay ]",
    "we address in detail the issue of proton decay due to gauge boson and scalar exchange , including partial widths , experimental constraints and flavour dependence .    in section [ gaugecoupling ]",
    "we discuss gauge coupling unification .",
    "we show how the requirement of unification implies the existence of light scalars , as well as observable proton decay signatures .    in section [ electroweak ]",
    "we start the discussion of the phenomenological implications of the model .",
    "one of the very interesting features of the model is that , while having a complicated higgs structure and many potentially light scalars , it can preserve custodial symmetry at tree level , such that electroweak constraints can be greatly relaxed compared to simple generic models .",
    "we discuss some of the possible collider signatures of the model , in particular the phenomenology of a doubly charged scalar .",
    "this has been extensively studied in various contexts and its dominant production mechanism is usually the drell - yan process .",
    "we emphasize here that in our model it is possible to have a large parameter space where @xmath2 fusion becomes the dominant production channel .",
    "we also discuss correlations between potential collider signatures and proton decay observations . in section [ octet ]",
    "we discuss the potential implications of a colour octet , electroweak doublet , which appears in our model and is rather light .    in section",
    "[ compare ] we present a comparison of our model with other @xmath0 grand unified models .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "as previously mentioned , the @xmath0 model we investigate is the simplest possible realization that satisfies the following requirements : renormalizability , the absence of other matter fields besides the ones that have already been observed experimentally and a viable phenomenology",
    ". we should thus be able to generate both the breaking of @xmath0 to the sm group as well as the sm symmetry breaking , all fermion masses and their mixing angles and gauge coupling unification , as well as be consistent with proton decay and other experimental constraints .",
    "the scalars present in the model are determined by the above requirements .",
    "let us start by specifying the representations responsible for the fermion mass generation .",
    "the @xmath3th generation of the sm matter fields resides in @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite . to be specific @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in order to generate mass through a renormalizable operator",
    ", a higgs representation must have a component that is both electrically neutral and @xmath11 colour singlet and be in the tensor product of the appropriate matter field representations .",
    "for the up quarks one needs either a @xmath12 or @xmath13 of higgs since the up quark mass originates from the contraction of @xmath4 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 . only @xmath16 and @xmath17 dimensional representations have a component that is both electrically neutral and colour singlet that could thus obtain a phenomenologically allowed vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the down quark and charged lepton masses originate from the contraction of @xmath4 with @xmath18 : @xmath19 .",
    "this time both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 of higgs are needed to obtain phenomenologically allowed masses .",
    "neutrinos on the other hand reside in @xmath5 .",
    "their majorana mass originates from the symmetric contraction of @xmath5 with @xmath18 .",
    "recall , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is a ( anti)symmetric representation .",
    "hence , to generate the majorana neutrino masses at the tree level , one must use a @xmath23 of higgs which happens to have a neutral component as part of a @xmath24 @xmath1 triplet .",
    "this is an @xmath0 implementation of the so - called type ii see - saw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath16 , @xmath25 and @xmath17 dimensional scalar representations one also needs a @xmath26 of higgs in order to break the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "these representations decompose under the sm as @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30",
    ". this decomposition will be useful when we discuss gauge coupling unification and proton decay .",
    "this completes the specification of the higgs sector that is uniquely determined by group - theoretical considerations once our requirements are imposed .",
    "in what follows we will always assume that all terms allowed by the gauge symmetry are present in the lagrangian density and specify them only when necessary .",
    "a beautiful feature of @xmath0 is that the phenomenologically allowed symmetry breaking chain is unique , i.e , @xmath31 .",
    "the grand unified symmetry is broken down to the sm by the vev of the sm singlet @xmath32 in the @xmath26 of higgs : @xmath33 .",
    "the symmetry breaking takes place at the so - called gut scale @xmath34 where the sm gauge couplings unify into @xmath35 . at this stage proton decay mediating gauge bosons @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) absorb the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) degrees of freedom and become massive .",
    "their masses are ( @xmath40 . due to this particular feature one",
    "is able to make accurate statements with regard to proton decay signatures via gauge mediation .",
    "the electroweak symmetry of the sm is subsequently broken by the vevs of @xmath1 doublets @xmath41 and @xmath42 as well as the vevs of @xmath1 triplets @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the first two are the sources of the charged fermion masses while the third one is the generator of neutrino masses .",
    "the vev of @xmath44 , on the other hand , affects masses of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 gauge bosons .",
    "we will see that the fields that participate in electroweak symmetry breaking should be light in order to have a phenomenologically viable model .",
    "fermion masses follow from the yukawa potential : @xmath47,\\qquad i , j=1,2,3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where greek indices are contracted in the @xmath0 space .",
    "the mass matrices , in an obvious notation , are    [ m ] @xmath48/\\sqrt{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are arbitrary @xmath56 yukawa matrices , while @xmath57 represents a symmetric @xmath56 matrix .",
    "the factor of 3 difference between the second terms in eqs .   and",
    "is the so - called georgi - jarlskog  @xcite factor .",
    "its origin is due to the fact that @xmath13 satisfies the following conditions : @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "hence , one has @xmath60 .",
    "the fermion mass eigenstate basis is defined through the following transformations : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . @xmath65",
    "represent diagonal matrices with real eigenvalues .",
    "eqs .   and",
    "imply @xmath66 if a @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) dimensional higgs representation is present .",
    "in other words , the one higgs doublet scenario predicts @xmath67 at the gut scale , which is in conflict with experimental observations .",
    "this is why both the @xmath12 and @xmath13 of higgs are needed .",
    ".  , on the other hand , shows that @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) induces a symmetric ( antisymmetric ) part in @xmath68 .",
    "this is very important for the discussion of the flavour dependence of the proton decay signatures .",
    "only if @xmath68 is a purely symmetric matrix does this dependence disappear in some of the decay channels  @xcite .",
    "it is thus clear that in _ any _ realistic model the @xmath0 symmetry can not insure even a partial absence of the flavour dependence in the proton decay signatures  @xcite .",
    "we will address this issue in more detail in section [ protondecay ] .",
    "although the higgs sector looks rather cumbersome , it is the simplest one that yields satisfactory phenomenology while preserving the matter content of the sm . at this point",
    "it seems difficult for the model to have any firm and testable predictions unless some additional assumptions are imposed .",
    "fortunately , as we soon demonstrate , the model does predict experimentally observable proton decay .",
    "it also predicts that some of the scalars have to be light enough to be of experimental interest in order for unification to take place .",
    "here we refer to @xmath41 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath69 and @xmath42 .",
    "if some of these fields are not very light they would jeopardize proton stability and hence rule out the model .",
    "in addition , there is a clear correlation between a light @xmath43 and the proton decay signatures that could allow unambiguous determination of the underlying mechanism of the neutrino mass generation .",
    "recall , the vev of @xmath43 generates massive neutrinos .",
    "we thus turn to the discussion of proton decay signatures and constraints .",
    "our main predictions rely strongly on consistent application of the current experimental bounds on the partial proton decay lifetimes that constrain the mass spectrum of the model .",
    "the vector gauge boson @xmath70 operators contributing to the decay of the proton in the @xmath0 framework are well - known  @xcite :    [ su5 ] @xmath71    @xmath3 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the colour indices , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the family indices , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "in addition there are two diagonal matrices containing cp violating phases , @xmath125 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore it is impossible to test a general @xmath0 scenario through the decay of the proton unless we specify both the full flavour structure and mass spectrum of the gut model .",
    "what is then usually assumed for the flavour structure , in order to extract a conservative limit on the gut scale , is that @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 . under these assumptions",

    "this in turn yields a lower bound on the phenomenologically allowed scalar mass to be around @xmath141gev .",
    "finally , let us for completeness discuss the flavour dependence of the experimental bound on @xmath34 .",
    "we will assume for the sake of argument the following flavour scenario  @xcite : @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( @xmath144 or @xmath145 ) .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .   that there will be no decays into antineutrinos while the only surviving channel with an antilepton in the final state is actually @xmath146 .",

    "if not predicts certain light scalars including the @xmath1 triplets with @xmath148 and @xmath24 , we need to address the issue of gauge coupling unification with these results in mind",
    ". we will explicitly assume the flavour scenario where @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 in what follows .",
    "the behavior of the gauge couplings between the electroweak and the gut scale is described by three renormalization group equations ",
    "one for each gauge coupling of the sm @xmath152 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "if we impose unification and accordingly eliminate the unified coupling constant @xmath139 , we are left with only two relevant equations  @xcite .",
    "these are :    @xmath153    where the right - hand sides reflect the latest experimental measurements of the sm parameters  @xcite .    in view of the fact that we are interested in proton decay signatures of our model , eq .",
    "is especially interesting .",
    "namely , for a given minimal @xmath154 value of a specific model , it is possible to obtain associated upper bound on @xmath34 , which is a crucial ingredient for accurate proton decay predictions .",
    "the @xmath155 coefficients on the other hand depend on the specific particle spectrum .",
    "more precisely , @xmath156 , where @xmath157 coefficients are given by : @xmath158 the sm content with @xmath159 light higgs doublet fields has @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "hence the sm case ( @xmath163 ) yields @xmath164 .",
    "clearly , additional particles with masses below the gut scale are required for successful unification .",
    "in addition to satisfying eq .  , any potentially realistic grand unified scenario must generate large enough gut scale in order to satisfy the proton decay constraints .",
    "the careful analysis of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 mediated proton decay from the previous section implies a lower bound on the gut scale in @xmath0 to be @xmath165@xmath166gev .",
    "again , we have assumed that @xmath167 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "our first aim is to show that successful unification implies proton decay signatures that are within the reach of the future proton decay experiments regardless of the exact mass spectrum of the scalars in our model .",
    "our discussion will also imply that some of the scalars  those that do not mediate proton decay  are _ always _ very light in order to have phenomenologically acceptable proton decay widths .",
    "we thus start by looking at the impact of light scalars @xmath168 with negative contributions toward the @xmath154 coefficient ( i.e. , @xmath169 ) on unification , since only those fields can raise the gut scale .",
    "we show that , if the vector gauge boson mediated proton decay is suppressed beyond the experimentally established limit , then the proton decay due to scalar exchange is experimentally accessible and vice versa .",
    "the multiplets with negative contribution to @xmath154 are @xmath170 , @xmath44 , @xmath69 , @xmath171 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath172 .",
    "we have underlined them for convenience in table  [ tab : table1 ] where we list all the @xmath173 contributions . @xmath171 and @xmath172 can not be arbitrarily light in order to avoid existing experimental limits on partial proton decay lifetimes .",
    "the fact that a @xmath171 exchange could contribute to proton decay has been recently pointed out  @xcite .",
    "other fields that mediate proton decay but have positive @xmath154 contributions are @xmath136 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "we have placed a line over them in table  [ tab : table1 ] for convenience .",
    "all these scalars should have masses of the order of @xmath141gev or higher unless some special arrangements take place in the yukawa sector that would suppress their contributions to proton decay .",
    "the important point is that if these scalar fields are as light as @xmath141gev their proton decay signatures would be at their present experimentally established limits . with that in mind",
    "we now determine an upper bound on the gut scale .",
    "we take the fields that do not mediate proton decay and set their masses to @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath176 , to get @xmath177 .",
    "the first two contributions are the usual sm contributions to @xmath154 while the net effect of all other scalar multiplets on @xmath154 is rather small .",
    "in fact , this yields via eq .   that @xmath178gev .",
    "this is clearly below the lower bound on @xmath34 as inferred from the experimentally measured limits on proton decay lifetime .",
    "if we now take into account that @xmath171 and @xmath172 could only be as light as @xmath141gev , which roughly translates into @xmath179 , we obtain @xmath180gev which should be considered as a conservative upper bound on the gut scale in our model at one - loop .",
    "if any of the fields with negative contributions to @xmath154 is actually heavier than what we have assumed , then the gut scale would accordingly go down in proportion to the corresponding @xmath181 contribution .",
    "in particular , if we want to suppress proton decay rates due to the scalar exchange by taking @xmath171 and @xmath172 masses to be significantly above @xmath141gev , we would significantly enhance decay rates due to the vector gauge boson exchange .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] the scalar @xmath155 coefficient contributions . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is evident from table  [ tab : table2 ] that our model insures correlations between the direct detection of the field responsible for the neutrino mass generation and observable proton decay signatures .",
    "that possibility is less likely in the model with the hybrid see - saw implementation .",
    "we have investigated a well - motivated @xmath0 model which implements a type ii see - saw mechanism for neutrino mass generation . the model is uniquely determined by requiring renormalizability , the lack of any additional matter fields besides those already observed , gauge coupling unification and a viable phenomenology .",
    "we have shown it is possible to test the underlying mechanism for neutrino mass generation through accelerator signatures and correlations with observable proton decay .",
    "the model predicts that all fields that can participate in electroweak symmetry breaking are light . due to a built - in custodial symmetry",
    ", the constraints from precision electroweak measurements are relaxed compared to standard general analysis and our model allows a possible enhancement of the couplings of the @xmath24 @xmath1 triplet to gauge bosons .",
    "this sort of setup can work in any @xmath0 theory with type ii see - saw neutrino mass generation .",
    "the doubly charged higgs present in the model offers promising opportunities for collider searches .",
    "in addition our model predicts a very light @xmath1 doublet that transforms as an octet of @xmath11 , with interesting phenomenological consequences . we have also shown that the proton decay signal is within reach of the next generation of experiments and it is correlated with the possible collider signatures of the electroweak scalars .",
    "we have also compared our model with the @xmath0 models that implement ( i ) the type i see - saw mechanism and ( ii ) the so - called hybrid scenario that combines the type i and type iii see - saw .",
    "we came to the conclusion that the minimal @xmath0 theory with type i see - saw is already excluded by experimental limits on partial proton decay lifetimes .",
    "our model also gives more promising signatures than the hybrid scenario .",

    "<S> we propose a simple , testable , @xmath0 model within the context of the type ii neutrino see - saw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on requiring renormalizability , the absence of any other matter fields besides those already present in the standard model and consistency with all experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> these `` minimal '' requirements , together with group - theoretical considerations , uniquely determine the model and lead to interesting implications . </S>",
    "<S> the model predicts correlation between a light @xmath1 triplet boson responsible for the type ii see - saw mechanism and observable proton decay signatures . </S>",
    "<S> it also allows for an enhanced production of doubly charged higgs particles through the @xmath2 fusion process due to a built - in custodial symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this could also have profound impact on the explicit realization of electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the model also predicts the existence of a light scalar that transforms as a colour octet and electroweak doublet , with interesting phenomenological consequences . </S>"
