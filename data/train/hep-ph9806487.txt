    "<S> we estimate the most important corrections to the branching ratios for the invisible decays of quarkonium states , arising from possible extensions of the standard model . among the possibilities considered </S>",
    "<S> are the presence of extra @xmath0-bosons , minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with r - parity violation and decays into goldstinos . </S>",
    "<S> prospects of detecting these corrections at existing and future b - factories and @xmath1-charm factories are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> = 10000    = 12pt    b - meson factories under construction at kek and at slac [ 1 ] can deliver @xmath2 @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s per year , when they are tuned to run at resonance . </S>",
    "<S> coupled with what is available at cleo iii , these facilities will make it possible for the first time to study in detail invisible decays of these resonances . </S>",
    "<S> such decay modes can be studied by observing the decay @xmath5 at resonance and tagging on the invariant mass of the dipion system at the @xmath3-mass .    </S>",
    "<S> invisible decays of heavy quarkonium states offer a window into what may lie beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that apart from neutrinos , the minimal standard model predicts no other channels that these states can decay into . </S>",
    "<S> the associated rates for these decays can be computed precisely , and so any observed departure can furnish hints of structures over and above those in the standard model . as we will show below , </S>",
    "<S> a more complete test of what these structures might be would require similar measurements on the @xmath6-invisible decay widths , something which could be achieved at the @xmath1-charm factory in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> in what follows , we concentrate on what we believe to be the largest among these effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will estimate the branching ratios into neutrinos in the presence of extra @xmath0-bosons , and r - parity violating effects in supersymmetrized standard models , and finally decays into goldstinos .    </S>",
    "<S> to begin , we present the standard model prediction for the branching ratio of the invisible decays of @xmath7 and @xmath8 and their observed decays into electron - positron pairs . </S>",
    "<S> to our knowledge the detail formulae have not been given before . </S>",
    "<S> within the standard model the invisible mode consists solely of decays into three types of neutrino - antineutrino pairs . neglecting polarization effects and taking into account @xmath9 production through a photon </S>",
    "<S> only we get @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the fermi and the fine structure constants respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 are masses for the @xmath7 and @xmath14 states . </S>",
    "<S> these formulas are expected to be correct up to about 2 - 3% . </S>",
    "<S> the major sources of theoretical uncertainty involved in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be listed as follows :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> corrections to the @xmath7 and @xmath15 wave functions , including qcd corrections and polarization effects , 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 production through z , 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> electroweak radiative corrections , 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> corrections due to the higgs boson .    the first correction is not expected to be significant since it similarly modifies the neutrino and electron decay widths , and so the leading order cancels in the branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the second correction will introduce a factor @xmath16 , and so is not expected to be significant either .    the third correction can be substantial , and thus needs to be considered in a little more detail . in the numerical calculation quoted above , we have included the @xmath17-running of the coupling constants in @xmath12 , @xmath11 , as well as in @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the @xmath0-mass , @xmath11 , and @xmath19 as the input parameters and run the other parameters from their values at the @xmath0-mass down to the low energies where the quarkonia reside . </S>",
    "<S> these are by far the most significant contributions . to the accuracy we are working in , of the order of 2 - 3% </S>",
    "<S> , we may ignore threshold effects . </S>",
    "<S> box - type diagrams with double z ( @xmath20 ) or photon emission which may be expected to modify the tree level results turn out to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the largest of these with two internal photon lines vanish due to charge- conjugation symmetry since both @xmath7 and @xmath15 are c - odd . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the remaining box diagram with virtual @xmath0 and @xmath21 also makes only a negligible correction to the tree level z - mediated @xmath9-production and can be discarded as well . finally , the higgs correction is vanishingly small simply because we are dealing with virtually massless particles in the final state .    as a result , </S>",
    "<S> branching ratios of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are theoretically clean and thus offer a rare opportunity to search for physics beyond the standard model if they are relatively large . among the most viable candidates </S>",
    "<S> are supersymmetry ( susy ) and grand unified theories ( guts ) . in the case of spontaneously broken susy </S>",
    "<S> the decays of @xmath7 and @xmath15 will produce invisible goldstinos ( or light gravitinos ) in addition to the neutrino models . </S>",
    "<S> all other particles in the final state are prohibited by kinematical considerations ( see [ 2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , measuring the invisible width and comparing it with the sm prediction could provide information about new physics . in the case of susy models </S>",
    "<S> , we can gain information on the susy - breaking scale as well as about the existence of r - parity violating terms in the superpotential .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the case of decay into light gravitinos denoted by @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the general structure of the goldstino interactions is known , and given for example in [ 3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 and @xmath15 can decay into goldstinos via virtual @xmath23 in the s - channel and via exchanges of @xmath24-squarks in the t - channel . neglecting the goldstino exchange effects , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding rates for the @xmath6 are calculated to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 v@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the mass of the c - quark ( squark ) and @xmath31 is the susy - breaking scale . </S>",
    "<S> the photon channel is suppressed as compared to the @xmath0 and @xmath32 ones since the photon - goldstino coupling containes higher powers of @xmath33 and can be neglected in the leading order approximation . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , for a reasonable choice for the value of @xmath34  tev[3 ] , these rates are extremely small and far beyond the experimental capabilities . doing the same calculation for the @xmath7 does not improve matters for gravitino decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> the above considerations rule out light gravitinos as candidates for the invisible decays .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , supersymmetry still can affect the invisible width because of r - parity breaking processes . </S>",
    "<S> such processes affect neutrino decay modes through squark exchange . in terms of superfields , </S>",
    "<S> the relevant interactions are generated by a @xmath35 term in the superpotential . here </S>",

    "<S> ( 6 ) it can be seen that the terms leading to neutrino final states involve the down quarks only , and the @xmath15 width _ will not _ be affected . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that one needs to take into account non - sm corrections to the neutrino widths only , since their contributions to @xmath38 production are far less than 0.1% and lead to higher order corrections to the branching ratio . neglecting possible squark mixings and quark mixings </S>",

    "<S> ( 6 ) also includes an incoherent piece coming from decays into neutrinos of different flavors .    </S>",

    "<S> it is seen that corrections to the sm result as large as 30% are possible for a range of r - parity violating couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we have cut off the @xmath50 values at the maximally allowed value of @xmath51 as dictated by experimental bounds only the @xmath52 s . similarly the sensitivity of the invisible @xmath3 decay to the @xmath53 mass is given in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , the @xmath53 will correspond to an extra u(1 ) ( for @xmath56 ) or to a neutral component of @xmath57 ( for left - right models ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of an extra @xmath53 is highly model dependent [ 9 ] . for the case of @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> this depends on the breaking of @xmath56 to the sm group . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , the sm result for @xmath6 width is unaffected by the extra @xmath56-@xmath53 boson since @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with r - breaking processes , the @xmath53 increases the @xmath7 width . hence , if both of these new physics sources are present , destructive interference between these non - sm corrections can take place if the parameters are favorable </S>",

    "<S> assuming @xmath72 , the mixing angle @xmath73 between @xmath0 and @xmath53 can be expressed as [ 8 ] @xmath74 then @xmath75 where @xmath76 one readily obtains the corresponding expression for the @xmath7 decay width from ( 8) with @xmath77 in this case the widths for both quarkonia will decrease as compared to their sm values .    in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> evidently , the latter resonance will not be suitable for probing this class of models .    </S>",
    "<S> we have argued that because of the theorectically clean nature of the decays a careful measurement of the invisible widths of the heavy quarkonium states can therefore yield constraints on a variety of physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> it is especially useful for studying r - parity breaking terms of the third generation in susy models . </S>",
    "<S> it is also sensitive to extra z bosons of guts or the left - right symmetric model . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed that the invisible channel will have to be due to the light neutrinos since the other possibility of light gravitinos will not be significant . </S>",
    "<S> neutralinos will also not contribute since a lower bound of 40 gev has already been established by lep measurements [ 11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if a deviation from the sm value is found in the @xmath3 decay a similar measurement for the j/@xmath79 can shed light on the source of new physics .    </S>",
