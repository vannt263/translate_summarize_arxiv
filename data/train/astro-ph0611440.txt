    "recent observations by swift and hete ii have confirmed the long - held suspicion that short grbs have a different central engine than long bursts : they occur at systematically lower redshifts @xcite and would therefore implie sunstantially larger isotropised energies than was inferred for the first set of detected short grbs with afterglows . ] , in galaxies with @xcite and without star formation @xcite , the emitted gamma - ray energy is substantially lower compared to long bursts @xcite and no supernova explosion seems to accompany the burst @xcite .",

    "it has to be pointed out that the last point in these curves is determined by the numerical mass resolution in the hydrodynamics simulations and should therefore be interpreted with some caution .",

    "typically , the x - ray luminosity about one hour after the coalescence is @xmath27 erg / s . for the investigated mass range , the spread in the luminosities one hour after the coalescence is about one order of magnitude . + the neutron star black hole cases show a larger diversity .",
    "the mass in the fallback material of different mass ratios varies by about a factor of 500 , see tab .",
    "[ tab : runs ] , an hour after the merger the accretion luminosities of the different nsbh systems differ by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "also the involved time scales change strongly with the binary mass ratio .",
    "for example , the 1.4 and 4 nsbh case does not produce much eccentric fallback material .",
    "accretion , at least to the resolvable level , is over in @xmath28 s. this accretion period may produce a short grb , but probably not much x - ray activity .",
    "the 1.4 and 18 nsbh system is at the other extreme : its peak luminosity is lower by three orders orders of magnitude but extends ( at a resolvable level ) up to about one hour .",
    "the mass ratios inbetween could possibly produce a ( weak ) grb and extended x - ray activity up to about one day after the burst .",
    "a simple analytical model was presented and used to derive the fallback time scales and accretion luminosities in the aftermath of a compact binary merger .",
    "the initial conditions are taken from a large set of 3d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the main assumption of this model is that the fallback material is ballistic , i.e. that hydrodynamical pressure forces can be neglected .",
    "this is a good approximation for the largest part of the time spent along the individual trajectories , therefore , the fallback time scales can be considered valid estimates .",
    "the assumption may only break down when the vicinity of remnant is approached , but this will only cause minor corrections to the fallback time scale and luminosity estimates . + for the range of mass ratios ( 1.1 to 1.6 ) that i have considered , double neutron star systems show a rather homogeneous fallback behaviour . at one hour after the coalescence their x - ray luminosity is still @xmath29 erg / s .",
    "neutron star black hole mergers provide a larger spread in their fallback behaviour . an hour after the tidal disruption of the neutron star ,",
    "their range in fallback luminosities is about two orders of magnitudes .",
    "some mass ratios could produce a grb , but not much x - ray activity , others may produce x - ray flaring only but no grb , and yet other systems can produce both .",
    "+ since this simple approach does not account for self - gravity and gas pressures , it tends to produce too smooth results .",
    "the shown luminosity curves should therefore be interpreted as temporal averages .",
    "the original accretion disks , such as the one seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] extending out to @xmath30 km , are consumed on a viscous time scale of _ visc ~1/_k ~0.05 s ( ) ^3/2 ( ) ( ) , where @xmath31 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xcite , @xmath32 the disk radius , @xmath33 the kepler frequency and @xmath34 is the mass of the central object .",
    "the outer parts of this disk are constantly fed by material that continuously falls back so that a low mass remnant disk is maintained until late times .",
    "the observed x - ray activity is expected to be produced by this disk and its interaction with the high - eccentricity fallback material .",
    "+ large - scale amplitude variations in the lightcurves ( `` flares '' ) can occur if the fallback material becomes subject to self - gravitational instabilities . whether a lump of gas is prone to this instability",
    "depends on the ratio of the cooling time , @xmath35 , and the local dynamical time , @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite finds for the case of thin accretion disks the condition @xmath37 .",
    "gravitational fragmentation is common in the outer regions of the accretion disks of agns @xcite and of young stellar objects @xcite . @xcite",
    "have suggested that such a fragmentation in the outskirts of an accretion disk could be the common mechanism behind the flaring observed in both long and short bursts .",
    "they note , however , that it may be difficult to reach the suitable conditions in the case of a compact binary merger .",
    "the fragmentation idea has recently been examined in more detail by @xcite for the case of collapsar disks .",
    "they argue that fragmentation may occur near the radius where alpha - particles are photodissociated since this consumes about 7 mev of thermal energy per nucleon and thus provides an efficient cooling mechanism .",
    "they suggest that even neutron star - like objects of low masses may form , but conclude that their disruption would be too rapid to account for the observed , post - grb x - ray flaring .",
    "+ some the eccentric fallback material could undergo gravitational fragmentation into one or several bound objects .",
    "since there is a large spread in orbital eccentricities , it seems unlikely that a large fraction of the fallback material agglomerates into a single fragment .",
    "if fragmentation occurs , it will do so only locally and for a small fraction of the material .",
    "a fragment of mass @xmath38 will release a flare energy of @xmath39 .",
    "when such a fragment of radius @xmath40 falls back towards the centre , it becomes tidally disrupted at a distance @xmath41 , or , if the remnant disk radius is larger than @xmath42 , the fragment will impact with nearly free - fall velocity on that disk . in both cases",
    ", it will trigger violent x - ray flaring activity .",
    "+ in this picture the grb is produced by the massive accretion disk that can form early on in the merger .",
    "the grb duration is determined by the viscous time scale on which this disk is consumed .",
    "the late - time x - ray activity , in contrast , is caused by the fallback of a smaller amount , about a tenth of the disk mass , of high - eccentricity material which is a natural outcome of the merger .",
    "the fallback time scales are set by the distribution of eccentricities in this material , which is a result of the torques that acted during the merger process .",
