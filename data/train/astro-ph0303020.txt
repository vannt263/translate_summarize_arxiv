    "the greatly anticipated results from the wmap project ( bennett  2003a ) have redefined the state of the art in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) science .",
    "the wmap project has provided full - sky coverage of the cmb at unprecedented angular resolution .",
    "the improvement over the only previous full - sky dataset ( cobe , smoot  1992 ) is of order 500 in terms of resolution elements , and the sky coverage improvement over balloon and ground - based experiments ( e.g. , de bernardis  2000 [ boomerang ] , stompor  2001 [ maxima ] , mason  2002 [ cbi ] , kovac  2002 [ dasi ] ) is several hundred . the experiment has resulted in dramatically improved constraints on cosmological parameters , such as the matter density , @xmath0 , hubble constant , @xmath1 , and cosmological constant , @xmath2 ( spergel  2003 )",
    ".    the tool of choice for assessing the cosmological parameters , is the power spectrum , where one calculates the products of the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath3 and their complex conjugates ( for each @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the @xmath6 expansion of the cmb sky , summed over @xmath5 values to form @xmath7 ) .",
    "this @xmath8 product , however , explicitly removes phase information . and while the power - spectrum is a very powerful tool for assessing cosmological parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath2 , it does ( explicitly ) remove any phase information contained in the @xmath3 coefficients themselves .",
    "these phases , however , contain critical information for characterizing the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "namely , standard inflation ( e.g. , guth 1981 , albrecht & steinhardt 1982 , linde 1982 , linde 1983 ) predicts that the temperature fluctuations in the cmb , at the resolution measured by wmap , will be characterized by spherical harmonic coefficients with gaussian distributed amplitudes and random phases .",
    "the wmap data provide our best opportunity to date to test that hypothesis .",
    "the genus topology method developed by gott , melott & dickinson ( 1986 ) directly tests for the gaussian random - phase nature of a density ( or temperature ) distribution in 3 dimensions ( adler 1981 ; gott , melott & dickinson 1986 ; hamilton , gott & weinberg 1986 ; gott , weinberg & melott 1987 ) , or in 2 dimensions ( adler 1981 ; melott  1989 ) .",
    "coles ( 1988 ) independently developed an equivalent statistic in 2 dimensions .",
    "the 2 dimensional case has been studied for a variety of cosmological datasets : on redshift slices ( park  1992 ; colley 1997 ) , on sky maps ( gott 1992 ; park , gott , & choi 2001 ; hoyle , vogeley & gott 2002 ) ; and on the cmb , in particular ( smoot  1992 ; kogut 1993 ; kogut  1996 ; colley , gott & park 1996 ; park , c - g .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the wmap team has recently measured the genus of the wmap sky ( komatsu  2003 ) , and demonstrated that the wmap results are consistent with the gaussian random - phase hypothesis . to do this",
    ", they carried out a large number of simulations of the cmb , in which the spherical harmonic coefficients were drawn from a gaussian random - phase distribution .",
    "they then used their known beam profiles , to simulate the results in each frequency , and applied the _",
    "kp0 _ ( bennett  2003b ) mask , just as one would with the real dataset . for each of these simulations",
    ", they computed the the genus ( as defined by melott  [ 1989 ] ) and compared it to the to that of the real dataset .",
    "they found that the real dataset does not depart significantly from the genus of the simulated gaussian random - phase datasets , very much in agreement with the results predicted for wmap by park  ( 1998 ) .",
    "that group further explored gaussianity by testing other minkowski functionals ( minkowski 1903 ) and the bispectrum ( related to the three - point correlation function ) , and found constraints on gaussianity similar to those provided by the genus study .",
    "we seek , first , to confirm this result using our own methods , but also to compare the genus measured from the data directly to the theoretical genus curve for structures on a sphere . rather than simulating gaussian random - phase realizations of the cmb",
    ", we compare directly to the theoretical prediction for the genus in two dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we provide some details about the nuances of carrying out the genus calculation on the healpix map projection and the stereographic map projection .",
    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) project team has released its one - year dataset in several different skymaps measured at varying frequency and angular resolution .",
    "namely , the project has measured the anisotropy at frequencies of 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94 ghz at angular resolutions of 0.82 , 0.62 , 0.49 , 0.33 , and 0.21 degrees ( fwhm beamwidths ) , respectively .",
    "the wmap team has released the data in a unique map projection called the healpix projection ( grski  2000 ) . we have chosen to re - present the wmap results in fig .",
    "[ fullstereo ] for a few reasons .",
    "first , we will be studying the genus on stereographic projections ( sections 6 and 7 ) , so it is useful to see the full sky map in that projection .",
    "second , we have chosen a much different color scheme that is more relevant to genus studies than the original color scheme used by the wmap team .",
    "the wmap color scheme is pretty , informative and impressive , but is not symmetric with respect to hot and cold spots . in our color scheme ,",
    "the mean temperature contour is white .",
    "higher temperatures than the mean are represented as linearly redder with temperature .",
    "lower temperatures than the mean are represented as linearly bluer with temperature . therefore , the amount of blue ink per pixel on the page is linearly proportional to the coldness of a cold spot , and the amount of red ink per pixel is linearly proportional to the the hotness of a hot spot .",
    "the scale runs from @xmath9 ( solid blue ) to @xmath10 ( solid red ) , the same range as in the temperature maps produced by the wmap team ( bennett  2003a ) . since the two - dimensional genus of a gaussian random - phase field is all about the symmetry between hot spots and cold spots , we find this color map highly instructive for our purposes .",
    "the properties of the genus are well - known in three dimensions ( 3d ) ( gott  1986 , hamilton  1986 , gott  1987 ) , but require some explanation in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case ( melott  1989 ) , particularly in the case of the sphere ( gott  1990 ) .    for 2d topology on a plane the 2d genus of a microwave background map is defined as ( melott  1989 ) : @xmath11 for a gaussian random field , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a parameter that measures the area fraction in the hot spots : @xmath14 so for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) there are more hot spots than cold spots , while for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) there are more cold spots than hot spots .",
    "the genus is also equal to the integral of the curvature around the temperature contour divided by @xmath19 .",
    "if we were to drive a truck around an isolated hot spot we would have to turn a total angle of @xmath19 as we complete an entire circuit around the hot spot . driving a truck around an isolated cold spot",
    ", we would turn a total angle of @xmath19 with the opposite sign , with a negative turn angle defined as one that is a turn to the left when the hot region is on your right .",
    "thus , in a temperature field that is divided into pixels we may define a pixel as hot if it is above the contour threshold and cold if it is below the contour threshold .",
    "then the contour line is actually composed of a series of line segments with turns occurring at vertices in the pixel map .",
    "there is a certain turn occurring at each vertex ( which , divided by @xmath19 , is equal to the contribution to the genus ) . around each vertex",
    "there are four pixels , the contribution to the total turn ( and genus ) at that vertex depends on how many of the four surrounding pixels are hot and cold :    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     if we were to smooth the edges of the cube by sanding , the edges would turn into quarter cylinders ( with zero gaussian curvature ) and the 8 vertices ( where three squares meet at a point ) turn into tiny octants of a sphere each with an integrated gaussian curvature of @xmath20 .",
    "the faces of the cube are flat so all the curvature is located in the 8 vertices .",
    "the edges of the three rhombuses meet at @xmath21 angles in the spherical octant .",
    "so in the case 1 hot and 2 cold there is a turn of @xmath22 there in the contour plus a curvature of @xmath23 ( equal to 1/3 of the integrated curvature over the octant of the sphere ) so the genus contribution ( turn plus parallel transport deviation = @xmath24 ) should correspond to @xmath25 ( or @xmath20 divided by @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is then added to the hot rhombus as this is the hot spot we are circling . in the case 2",
    "hot , 1 cold , there is a @xmath26 turn , plus two regions of @xmath23 curvature contributing to the parallel transport deviation , making a total contribution of 0 to the genus . in the case 3",
    "hot , 0 cold , the vertex lies entirely within the hot region but it adds @xmath20 to the curvature integral within that region and this must be shared equally with all three rhombuses to add @xmath27 to the genus in each .",
    "the total genus for the sphere @xmath28 is calculated by adding the genus from all 12 rhombuses . from @xmath28",
    "we can calculate @xmath29 by subtracting @xmath30 .",
    "we can calculate @xmath31 as simply the fraction of the diamond shaped pixels that are hot , since these are all equal area .",
    "thus , from the wmap data we can calculate the 2d topology and compare it with that expected from a gaussian random - phase distribution .",
    "the most direct data product from the wmap team is the `` internal linear combination '' ( ilc ) map of the cmb , which is given in the healpix format .",
    "this ilc map uses the optimum linear combination of the skymaps at the different frequencies to remove the galaxy and some other foregrounds ( bennett  2003b ) .",
    "this is the primary map distributed as the best rendering of the cmb and has a resolution ( beam width ) of @xmath32 . though this map presents a few problems for directly computing the genus ( which we will address shortly )",
    ", it is worth checking the genus on this map directly .",
    "the healpix projection provides a natural division of the dataset ( sky ) into 12 independent regions .",
    "we therefore measured the genus in each of these regions and computed the total for the whole sky , which we plot in fig .",
    "[ hpg_2 ] . in this figure @xmath13",
    "is computed in terms of the pixel - wise temperature mean and standard deviation measured over the whole sky ( method 1 ) .",
    "this method would be equivalent to the area fraction method described by equation ( [ areafrac ] ) if the pixel histogram of temperature were strictly gaussian .",
    "[ hpg_1 ] is identical , except that @xmath13 is computed by area fraction in each individual healpix rhombus ( method 2 ) ; see equation ( [ areafrac ] )",
    ". using the area fraction method measures more directly the random - phase nature of the distribution , since it separates that from any departures from a gaussian histogram of the temperature ( which could be measured directly ) . in method 1 , we use @xmath13 defined in terms of the standard deviation in temperature over the whole sky ; in method 2 , we define @xmath13 by area fraction in each rhombus , thus treating each of the 12 rhombuses completely independently .",
    "the two methods provide a contrast of data treatment , and yet , as we shall see , give essentially identical results .    the inner errorbars in figs .",
    "[ hpg_2 ] and [ hpg_1 ] are the standard deviation of the mean in the genus for the whole sky , estimated from those the 12 independent regions of the sky ( adding the values of @xmath29 obtained from each ) .",
    "the standard one - sigma errorbars are shown as the inner errorbars .",
    "the outer errorbars show the @xmath33 ( gaussian two - sigma ) confidence interval for a students-@xmath34 variable with 12 degrees of freedom , which we will explain shortly .    the solid curves in figs .",
    "[ hpg_2 ] and [ hpg_1 ] give the gaussian random - phase genus curve , according to equation ( [ g2d ] ) , with the best fit amplitude applied .",
    "the amplitudes , @xmath35 , [ @xmath36 , in figs .",
    "[ hpg_2 ] and [ hpg_1 ] are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "these are by far the highest in any genus measurements of cosmological structure to date .",
    "as expected , the first value of @xmath35 is lower than the second , because the power at large scales ( quadrupole and octopole ) lifts some regions ( rhombuses ) to higher temperature , congealing some hot spots therein , but lowers other regions ( rhombuses ) , congealing some cold spots therein .",
    "method 2 sets a median in each rhombus separately and thus discovers more structures .",
    "the students-@xmath34 formulation is necessary since we are estimating the standard error with the distribution itself .",
    "namely , if the true genus for the whole sky at each point on the curve were @xmath39 and the true standard deviation in the mean expected for that number of structures were @xmath40 ( we expect the distribution to be gaussian for gaussian random - phase fields [ gott  1990 ] ) , then our estimator for @xmath39 is the arithmetic average estimated from the 12 rhombuses ( the values from each rhombus are multiplied by twelve , then they are averaged ) , @xmath41 , and our estimator for @xmath40 is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the root - mean - square difference from the mean ( as usual ) .",
    "we expect that @xmath39 is given exactly by equation ( [ g2d ] ) and that our best fit for the amplitude has negligible error compared to any one point on the curve .",
    "the expression @xmath44 is defined to be a students-@xmath34 variate ( lupton 1993 ) .    on average",
    ", we would expect only one of the 21 points in each of the genus curves in figs .",
    "[ hpg_2 ] and [ hpg_1 ] to miss the curve outside of the 95.4% confidence errorbar .",
    "in fact , not even one misses . from the properties of the students-@xmath34 distribution with 12 d.o.f .",
    ", one would expect to find that 33.7% ( @xmath45 ) of the 21 points miss the curve by more than the inner errorbars . in both cases ,",
    "the agreement is again better than expected , with only three misses in each figure .",
    "this better - than - expected agreement can easily arise by chance from correlations between the genus measurements at neighboring values of @xmath13 , as shown by colley ( 1997 ) ( these correlations mean that the 21 data points are not completely independent  neighboring genus values measure many of the same structures ) .",
    "nonetheless , the genus of temperature fluctuations in the cmb , as observed by wmap , is certainly consistent with the gaussian random - phase hypothesis .",
    "in the ilc healpix data release , there are a couple issues that must be addressed .",
    "the first issue is foreground emission .",
    "bennett ( 2003b ) discuss in quite a bit of detail the foregrounds in the wmap results .",
    "they provide a very useful sky mask that should be applied to avoid foreground contaminants , the principal one of which is the galaxy . in a second study , we have therefore used their _ kp0 _",
    "( most conservative ) sky mask , which also removes some 200 point sources .",
    "furthermore , we have restricted ourselves to galactic latitudes @xmath46 .",
    "since the mask must remove much of the area near the galactic equator , the healpix projection , with its 4 equatorial diamonds , ceases to be ideal .",
    "instead , we re - project the map , using the stereographic projection for both the northern and southern galactic hemispheres ( as in fig .",
    "[ fullstereo ] , in which the @xmath47 cut occurs at 72.7% of the total radius in each hemisphere ) .",
    "we can calculate @xmath28 from the north and south galactic caps by using stereographic map projections of the caps .",
    "stereographic map projections of a hemisphere are conformal and preserve angles . a stereographic projection of the north galactic cap is a circle , in which azimuthal angle in the map is the galactic longitude in the cap .",
    "radius in the map , @xmath48 $ ] ( see fig .  [ fullstereo ] ) .",
    "the outside boundary is a circle of radius @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the contours on the sphere can be approximated as spherical polygons ",
    "geodesic segments joined at vertices where turning on the sphere occurs .",
    "the stereographic projection preserves angles , so the turning that occurs at vertices is mapped properly .",
    "but , geodesics ( great circles ) are mapped into arcs of circles rather than straight lines , which turn on the map but not on the sphere so the total genus @xmath28 on the sphere is not automatically calculable from the total turning that comes from circling the density contour on the map .",
    "so instead of calculating @xmath28 for the sphere from the stereographic map directly , which would be complicated , let us instead calculate the relation between @xmath29 on a spherical cap , and @xmath50 measured by the contour2d program on the flat stereographic map of the cap .",
    "[ of course once we have @xmath29 we can calculate the contribution to @xmath28 due to the structures in the north galactic cap by adding @xmath51 .",
    "but it is really @xmath29 we are interested in anyway because it is what will be compared to the theoretical formula .",
    "thus , we can skip a step by going directly after @xmath29 .",
    "to begin , let us excise the spherical cap from the sphere by cutting it off and separating it from the rest of the sphere .",
    "this will add boundary terms .",
    "each hot spot ( think curved lead sheet ) that intersects the boundary of the cap will be closed off by a curve along the boundary that will make it an isolated hot spot .",
    "think about these hot spots in 3d when the cap is excised from the rest of the sphere : any hot spot that hits the boundary will become isolated , floating in space , because beyond the boundary there is nothing .",
    "this spherical isolated cap will have a value of @xmath52 ; the total genus of the isolated flat stereographic map sitting isolated in the plane  think of flat lead sheets lying in a plane ; because one can be continuously deformed into the other .",
    "we can calculate the terms contributing to @xmath53 : @xmath54 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] the first term , @xmath55 , is equal to @xmath56 for the interior of the spherical cap .",
    "it is the total turns made driving on the sphere around all the contours within the spherical cap , and excludes any boundary terms produced by excising the spherical cap .",
    "now @xmath57 , so it is what we want to calculate to compare with the theoretical genus formula .",
    "the term @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is measured in steradians , is the integrated gaussian curvature within the hot spots in the cap divided by @xmath19 , which contributes to the genus by the 3d argument presented above . the term @xmath60 is the sum of the turns that are made when you are driving along a contour and you encounter the cap boundary and",
    "then must turn a sharp corner there to continue driving along the cap boundary to complete circling that hot spot as an isolated region . in general ,",
    "if along the boundary there are @xmath61 hot segments , there will be @xmath62 such turns , as we enter and then exit each of these n hot segments along the boundary .",
    "each of these @xmath62 turns will be some angle between 0 and @xmath19 . the final term , @xmath63 $ ] , represents the total turning on the sphere that occurs driving along the @xmath61 hot segments of the boundary of the cap .",
    "if the entire boundary were hot then driving around it would have a total turn of @xmath64 .",
    "( for example , if this were a hemispherical cap the area of the cap would be @xmath19 and the total turn circling the boundary would be zero , because the boundary is the equator and it is a geodesic so no turning is required to circle the boundary ) . as the area of the cap goes to zero ,",
    "the curvature within the cap becomes unimportant to parallel transport and the total turn required to circle the boundary approaches @xmath19 .",
    "in general , the angle deflection suffered by parallel transport around the closed boundary curve is equal to the integral of the gaussian curvature inside , which in this case is equal to the area of the cap .",
    "when we have completed the circuit , we have returned to where we have started so we have suffered a total rotation of @xmath19 , so the turning we do on the sphere circling the boundary plus the area of the cap is @xmath19 . thus , turning = @xmath65 .",
    "the number @xmath66 is the fraction of the boundary that is hot , and so it is this fraction of the boundary that we drive around .",
    "dividing this by @xmath19 , gives the contribution to the genus derived by driving along the hot segments of the boundary : @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "using the copernican principle , one would not expect the boundary to be special , so on average the fraction of the cap boundary that was hot should be equal to the fraction of the sphere that is in hot spots . on average then , we expect @xmath68 . substituting we find : @xmath69 @xmath70 now let us measure the genus on the excised stereographic map ( @xmath71 ) , recalling that the excised stereographic map is topologically equivalent to the excised cap .",
    "@xmath72 the first term , @xmath73 , is the quantity measured by contour2d on the flat map .",
    "contour2d examines only the cartesian vertices within the stereographic map region and does not include any boundary effects .",
    "there is no @xmath74 term because the map is flat and there is zero curvature inside the hot spots .",
    "the next term , @xmath75 , adds the turns that are taken when the contour hits the outer circular boundary of the map . if we use a stereographic projection , which is conformal and preserves angles , each and every turn at the boundary in the map will be equal that encountered on the sphere , so : @xmath76 the final term , @xmath66 , is the total turn taken on the @xmath61 hot segments of the boundary of the map divided by @xmath19 . if we circled the entire boundary we would have to turn a total of @xmath19 , because the map is flat and euclidean geometry applies .",
    "the @xmath61 hot segments cover a fraction @xmath66 of the boundary ( galactic longitude is mapped onto azimuth in the stereographic map , so the fraction of the map boundary occupied by the @xmath61 hot segments is exactly the same as on the sphere ) .",
    "thus , the total turn is @xmath77 , and dividing this by @xmath19 gives @xmath66 .",
    "as we have remarked above , if the boundary is not special we expect @xmath68 . since the map is excised and sits alone on the plane , these outer boundary segments must be included to create isolated hot spots in the plane out of the hot regions that hit the boundary . equating @xmath78 and @xmath71 ( because the cap can be deformed into the map ) , and substituting from the above equations we find : @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 so `` what you see is what you get . ''",
    "if we measure the 2d topology in the interior of the stereographic map using contour2d ( which ignores the boundary ) our result will equal , on average , @xmath56 which is what we were looking for .",
    "this works for any radius spherical cap , since terms proportional to the area of the cap cancel out . and",
    "since the map is conformal , the turns at the boundary are equal in both cases and cancel out as well . finally ,",
    "since we expect the boundary to be typical , its coverage with hot spots should be equal to the fraction @xmath31 of the sphere covered by hot spots , and this causes other terms to cancel as well , leaving the above simple result .",
    "we may now compute the 2-d genus on a stereographic re - projection of the wmap data , in which we address the issues of foreground contamination and noise variability arising from the scanning strategy of the wmap spacecraft .",
    "first , to alleviate contamination from the galaxy , we completely exclude the equator region up to @xmath82 .",
    "the _ kp0 _ mask does include removal of local regions for point source avoidance , and some additional galaxy masking above the @xmath47 cut , particularly near the galactic center , the gum nebula and orion complex .",
    "any vertex in the stereographic map projection that falls within the mask is simply ignored by contour2d .",
    "we proceed by dividing the stereographic projection into octants which correspond to octants on the sphere .",
    "these octants form 8 independent regions in which to measure the genus .",
    "a slight adjustment for the actual solid angle in each octant is made , because the _ kp0 _ mask changes the solid angle of each octant very slightly ( a few percent variation ) .",
    "we normalize the genus to the mean solid angle of the masked octants , and proceed treating each masked octant as one of 8 independent measurements of the genus per average masked octant .    in carrying out the re - projection to the stereographic map",
    ", we have applied a slight smoothing to a total smoothing fwhm of @xmath83 .",
    "[ g.35_2 ] and [ g.35_1 ] show the genus for the masked stereographic projection , computed by methods 1 and 2 ( same methods as in the healpix genus computation ) .",
    "the errorbars are computed now for 8 octants instead of 12 diamonds , which changes somewhat the relative size of the 95.4% errorbars and the direct one - sigma errorbars .",
    "the best fit theoretical genus curve ( equation [ g2d ] ) is plotted in each figure , with respective amplitudes of @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( as with the healpix genus curves , the first value is slightly less than the second , as expected ) .",
    "the amplitudes have come down somewhat from the healpix maps due to the exclusion of the equatorial band ( so the total genus covers only a fraction of the whole sphere ) , the additional masked pixels in the _ kp0 _ prescription , and the additional smoothing applied in the stereographic projection .    in",
    "each of the figures , the agreement with the theoretical genus curve is striking .",
    "quantitatively , we would expect on average that one of the 21 points sampling the curve would miss the theoretical fit outside is 95.4% errorbar . with method 1 ( fig .",
    "[ g.35_2 ] ) , no points miss the theoretical curve outside their 95.4% errorbar , while with method 2 ( fig .  [ g.35_1 ] ) , two points miss by a small margin .",
    "the one - sigma ( inner errorbars ) for the 8 degrees of freedom of the octants reside at the 65.3% confidence interval , so on average , one would expect approximately 7 of the 21 points on each of fig .",
    "[ g.35_2 ] and fig .",
    "[ g.35_1 ] to miss the theoretical curve outside their one - sigma errorbars .",
    "using method 1 , we find that 3 points miss at this margin , and 9 miss using method 2 . though the method 2 results show slightly more than the average number of misses expected at both the one - sigma and 95.4% level , the excess is certainly within the uncertainty arising from small number statistics in each case .",
    "the second contaminant in the ilc healpix map is that the noise behavior is very complicated , and differs substantially pixel to pixel .",
    "first , the beams at each frequency in the combination have different widths .",
    "second , the scan method of the wmap satellite yields many more samples at the ecliptic poles than at the ecliptic equator ( see bennett  2003a , fig .",
    "3 ) . to alleviate some of these problems ,",
    "we have downloaded from the wmap website maps in the same 5 frequencies as used in the ilc map , but ones that have been pre - smoothed to the same effective beam - width ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "these are then added with the same weights as used in producing the ilc map . at cost of number of structures",
    ", these maps significantly enhance the signal - to - noise of remaining structures , thus reducing the significance of the noise differences arising from the scanning strategy .",
    "this is , therefore our most conservative map .    in projecting these maps into stereographic maps ,",
    "we have smoothed to @xmath87 , slightly more than the @xmath86 smoothing of the pre - smoothed maps .",
    "[ g.9_2 ] and [ g.9_1 ] show the genus measured in these stereographic projections .",
    "the best - fit amplitudes have dropped to @xmath88 for method 1 and @xmath89 for method 2 , due to the smoothing .    from these final stereographic projections ,",
    "the genus measured at the 21 points should also be expected to miss the theoretical curve outside of the 95.4% errorbars once on each figure .",
    "what we find is that with method 1 ( fig .",
    "[ g.9_2 ] ) , no points miss the curve outside the 95.4% errorbar , while with method 2 , ( fig .  [ g.9_1 ] ) , one point misses by a small amount .",
    "the points miss the curve outside their one - sigma errorbars 2 times for method 1 , and 4 times for method 2 , again a bit better than expected .",
    "the final figure , fig .",
    "[ g.9_1 ] , represents our most conservative estimate of the true genus available in the wmap distribution , and shows excellent agreement with the gaussian random - phase hypothesis .",
    "as we have shown , topologically , within the errors , the cmb measured by wmap appears to be consistent with gaussian random - phase . indeed , the overall visual impression is strikingly random - phase .",
    "the stereographic projection is conformal , so shapes are preserved locally , though the scale grows as one approaches the the outer boundary ( by a factor of two from the pole to the equator , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fullstereo ] ) .",
    "we may ask if there are any features visible in the map at all that look non - random - phase in any way .",
    "our choice of map projection has a miscellaneous advantage over the molleweide projection used by the wmap team , which is that it shows the galactic polar regions very well . in the south polar region",
    ", there is one possibly non - random feature , a fairly narrow red ( hot ) feature stretching from approximately the 8:30 position toward the 2:30 position curving like a bow below the south galactic pole .",
    "this feature is more visually apparent when viewed in landscape orientation .",
    "it has the appearance of a scanning error approximately along a great circle , but is not coincident with any particular locus in the wmap scanning geometry .",
    "we have considered several possibilities to explain such a feature .",
    "first , there is the simple phenomenon of the `` canals '' on mars , the linear features reported in naked - eye observations of the red planet in the late @xmath90 century .",
    "we now know that there are no such canals , and that our eyes highly evolved ability to detect linear features or edges was simply creating an illusion .",
    "most likely the same thing is going on here , particularly since the feature is more apparent when the figure is viewed in landscape rather than in portrait orientation .",
    "in fact , if one had a true gaussian random - phase distribution and there were no features that looked unusual to the eye , that would be unusual .",
    "so this feature may be merely coincidental .",
    "what are the other possibilities ?",
    "it is not coincident with the magellanic stream measured seen in 21 cm ( brooks 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , we would expect the stream to have similar microwave `` color '' to the gas in the galaxy , and hence be subtracted about as well as the galaxy is in the ilc map . to test this",
    ", we constructed a three color map , using the k band as red , q as green and w as blue , and found that while the foregrounds were distinctly pink to orange to yellow , the cmb was quite grey , and so was the feature .",
    "another possibility that comes to mind is cosmic strings .",
    "cosmic strings , however , do not amplify temperature along a line .",
    "instead , a moving cosmic string produces a cliff , hotter on one side ( the trailing side ) than the other side ( the leading side ) .",
    "thus a hot stripe would require two parallel cosmic strings , having just passed each other ( an interesting theoretical possibility [ gott 1991 ] , but not a likely one , since we are unlikely to find the two most prominent cosmic strings within the horizon in such an alignment by chance ) . also , there is no obvious evidence for cosmic string cliffs anywhere else in the wmap data , which we have tested for by making gradient maps as suggested by gott  ( 1990 )",
    ".    the feature could also be due to the integrated sachs - wolfe effect from a great wall seen edge - on , but in looking at several galaxy catalogs and x - ray maps , we could detect no obvious feature with appropriate geometry .",
    "this list of possibilities is by no means exhaustive , and , in the end , it may be most likely that we are simply falling prey to `` martian canals '' in an overall gaussian random - phase map . since there are countless possibilities for what one may see and deem non - random ( circles , squares , triangles , even letters or words ) , the _ a posteriori _ statistical significance of any such weak feature is difficult to estimate .",
    "the overall consistency with of the genus topology in the wmap data with that predicted _ a priori _ from a gaussian random - phase distribution is quite spectacular .",
    "wmap s unprecedented combination of angular resolution and all - sky coverage of the cosmic microwave background has presented by far the best confirmation to date of the standard inflationary prediction of gaussian random - phase initial conditions .    in standard inflation ,",
    "the structures seen in the cmb are fossil remains of random quantum fluctuations occurring just @xmath91 seconds after the big bang . in galaxy clustering surveys ,",
    "these fossils have become somewhat distorted due to non - linear effects and biased galaxy formation . in the cmb , however , we are seeing these fluctuations while they are still in the linear regime , making the wmap measurements of the cmb a very attractive dataset for studying these primordial perturbations .",
    "with the hundreds of structures observed even at the @xmath87 scale , the wmap results have provided the largest and best dataset for studying the primordial structures .",
    "the genus topology test , in particular , tests the dataset for the standard inflationary prediction that the fluctuations should derive from a gaussian random - phase distribution .",
    "all of our tests have confirmed this prediction dramatically .",
