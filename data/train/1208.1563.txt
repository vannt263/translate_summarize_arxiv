    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes play a role of theoretical laboratory , where different areas of physics appear to make close contact , as exemplified in the ads / cft correspondence and its various applications  @xcite . in this context , it is essential , besides its asymptotic symmetries , that the conformal infinity of ads spacetime is timelike and therefore can be viewed as another  lower dimensional ",
    "spacetime where non - gravitational theories dual to gravity theories in ads are supposed to reside .",
    "ads spacetimes are maximally symmetric , negatively curved , geodesically complete but non - globally hyperbolic , due to this timelike nature of infinity . as such , for any given point @xmath0 of ads spacetime , all _ timelike geodesics _ from @xmath0",
    "never reach the infinity and necessarily intersect the antipodal point @xmath1 to @xmath0.-dimensional ads spacetime we mean the covering space of anti - de sitter spacetime so that its topology is @xmath2 , rather than @xmath3 , and therefore contains no closed timelike curves . ] this can easily be seen by considering the cosmological chart @xmath4 where for simplicity the curvature radius is normalized to unity .",
    "this describes an open flrw universe with big - bang and big - crunch respectively at @xmath5 , where the scale factor vanishes .",
    "in fact , because of its maximum isometries , for any given point @xmath0 in ads , one can find the same cosmological chart in which @xmath0 corresponds to the big - bang or crunch point [ see figure  [ flrw - chart ] ] . these big - bang / crunch points are merely a singular point of congruences of geodesic curves with the tangent @xmath6 or a caustic thereof , but not a singularity of the spacetime structure itself . however , since all the comoving lines converge there , one can anticipate that if perturbed by , e.g. , adding some matter fields , then the perturbation fields may grow along the comoving lines and eventually make big - bang / crunch points true curvature singularities .",
    "if this is the case it may be viewed also as a cauchy horizon instability since the boundary of the causal past of @xmath1 is the cauchy horizon for any @xmath7 partial cauchy surface .     ,",
    "width=94 ]    to study such dynamics of perturbations in ads spacetimes , suitable boundary conditions on perturbation fields need to be imposed at ads infinity .",
    "it has been shown that under the dirichlet ( and some other types of ) boundary conditions , ads spacetime is stable at least with respect to linear perturbations  @xcite .",
    "however , there has recently appeared evidence that asymptotically ads spacetimes are _ non - linearly _",
    "unstable  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown by bizon and rostworowski  @xcite that upon certain assumptions , a black hole ",
    "hence singularities as well  must be formed in asymptotically ads spaces : they considered a spherically symmetric gravitating system of a minimally coupled massless scalar field and numerically shown that any gaussian - type wave packet of the field does necessarily collapse to form a black hole .",
    "this should be compared to the asymptotically flat case , in which it has been shown that small but non - linear perturbations remain small in its amplitude , and gravitational collapse of matter fields does not necessarily result in the black hole formation . more specifically , according to choptuik s numerical calculation  @xcite of a scalar field collapse , the initial data set can be divided into two classes : supercritical and subcritical data . in the former case where the gaussian - type wave packet has large amplitude , the scalar field collapses to form a black hole , whereas in the latter case",
    ", having small amplitude , the gaussian wave packet bounces off the center of the spherical symmetry and escapes to infinity without forming a black hole .",
    "in contrast , the results of ads nonlinear instability above @xcite indicates that asymptotically ads spacetimes are generically singular .",
    "one is therefore led to anticipate type of singularity theorems to be established in a class of asymptotically ads spacetimes without there being any region of strong gravity to trap on initial data surface .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss singularity theorems in asymptotically ads spacetimes . in the first part , we will attempt to clarify which results of the well - known singularity theorems can apply to the asymptotically ads case .",
    "we briefly review the basics of singularity theorems and see that hawking and penrose s version of the singularity theorems applies to the ads case without any major change in its assumptions , in section  [ sec : basics ] .",
    "the singularity theorems typically assume the existence of a strong gravity region , such as a closed trapped surface .",
    "however , the results of @xcite indicates that a black hole forms even starting from arbitrarily small initial perturbations , and thus one may hope to obtain a singularity theorem with _",
    "weaker _ , or even _ no _ , assumptions concerning strong gravity region .",
    "we discuss what the main obstacle is when attempting to eliminate the assumption of trapped sets from singularity theorems in asymptotically ads case , in section  [ subsec : diff ] . in the second part",
    ", we will focus on a specific case : a system of spherically symmetric spacetime with a perfect fluid , and present a singularity theorem , in section  [ sec : sss ] . to show our singularity theorem we have to impose a condition that guarantees that the spacetime to consider must be dynamical in a certain sense .",
    "also we will see that our proof need some restriction on the equation of state of the perfect fluid .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] and discuss future directions of the present subject . in appendix",
    ", we discuss whether one can find a regular , static configuration in asymptotically ads spacetime in a similar setting discussed in the main part of the paper .",
    "we start with briefly recapitulating basic ideas of the singularity theorems and then discuss whether ( or which of ) the singularity theorems can fit the case of asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "a spacetime singularity is defined by , as one of its essential features , the causal geodesic incompleteness .",
    "the singularity theorems show that under physically reasonable conditions , the spacetime must be ( either timelike or null , or both ) geodesically incomplete . as `` physically reasonable '' conditions , typically imposed are    * the energy conditions * the conditions on global structure , * the existence of a strong gravity region    the condition  ( a ) describes , via the einstein equations , the convergence of causal geodesic congruences . for some versions of the singularity theorems ,",
    "the generic conditions may also be required .",
    "the condition  ( b ) is the requirement of either the strong causality or chronology condition or the existence of a cauchy surface .",
    "the condition  ( c ) requires a closed trapped surface for gravitational collapse , and in the cosmological context , a compact achronal hypersurface without edge or a point for which a null geodesic congruence starts to reconverge .    to show the geodesic incompleteness",
    ", the following two notions play a central role :    * existence of ( a pair of ) conjugate points , * global hyperbolicity .",
    "the occurrence of a pair of conjugate points concerns the behavior of a geodesic congruence , which is governed by the raychauduri equation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes an affine parameter of a geodesic curve with tangent @xmath10 , @xmath11 the expansion of the geodesic congruence , @xmath12 the shear , and the number @xmath13 depends on if @xmath10 is timelike or null and also on the number of spacetime dimensions @xmath14 . at conjugate points , the expansion diverges : @xmath15 .",
    "it is ensured by the condition ( a ) above  together with the generic condition , and is essentially due to the fact that gravity is attractive .",
    "the existence of conjugate points leads the following important result .",
    "consider a future directed causal curve , @xmath16 , from @xmath0 to @xmath17 , whose length is given by @xmath18 now suppose that @xmath19 is geodesic and contains a point @xmath20 conjugate to @xmath0 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "then one can find a future directed causal curve from @xmath0 to @xmath1 whose length is longer than @xmath19 , by considering the second variation of the length @xmath21 .",
    "a similar result holds between a point and a hypersurface .",
    "a set @xmath22 in @xmath23 is said to be globally hyperbolic if the strong causality holds on @xmath22 and for any two points @xmath24 , @xmath25 is compact , contained in @xmath22 .",
    "the importance of this notion for the singularity theorems is that it enables one to prove existence of maximal length causal curves .",
    "namely , for any causally related two points , @xmath0 and @xmath17 , in a globally hyperbolic region @xmath26 , there exists a geodesic curve from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in @xmath22 which attains the maximal length among all continuous causal curves from @xmath0 to @xmath1 in @xmath26 .",
    "again a similar result holds between a point and a hypersurface .",
    "this , combined together with the result from ( i ) , implies that in a globally hyperbolic region @xmath22 , no causal geodesic curve connecting two points @xmath24 can contain a pair of conjugate points within the two points if it has the maximal length among all continuous causal curves from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the singularity theorems show that under suitable versions of the conditions  ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , if all geodesics are complete , then there must be a globally hyperbolic region within which every causal geodesic curve has to admit a pair of conjugate points on it , thus establishing a contradiction that falsifies the assumption of the geodesic completeness .",
    "there are several different versions of the singularity theorems depending on different combinations of the conditions  ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) .",
    "the first theorem [ see theorem  1 in chapter 8 of @xcite ] , proposed by penrose for gravitational collapse , requires the null convergence for the condition  ( a ) , the existence of a closed trapped surface as for ( c ) , and the existence of non - compact cauchy surface as for ( b ) .",
    "the last one in particular requires that the entire spacetime @xmath23 be globally hyperbolic , which is clearly not the case for asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes .    hawking s theorem for cosmological singularities",
    "[ see theorem 4 in chapter 8 of @xcite ] removes the assumption of global hyperbolicity by , instead of requiring an expanding cauchy surface , an expanding compact spacelike hypersurface without edge .",
    "ads conformal boundary acts just like a boundary of a box that confines bulk fields . for",
    "this reason one might anticipate that hawking s version of the singularity theorem may be generalized to apply to asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "this theorem again does not straightforwardly apply as the ads is not spatially compact does not dominate over other cosmic matter contents on some initial data surface , one might anticipate that either penrose s or hawking s theorem just mentioned above would apply since @xmath27 generally enhances the convergence of timelike geodesics and does not affect the convergence of null geodesics [ as seen in ( [ eqn : raychaudhuri ] ) combined together with ( [ condi : timelike : convergence ] ) below ] .",
    "in fact , such a generalization of singularity theorems for open universes with a cauchy surface or closed universes has been considered in the earlier work  @xcite , in which the effects of a negative cosmological constant on the timelike convergence were taken into account . in that case",
    ", however , the requirement of either a cauchy surface / global hyperbolicity or a compact surface without edge would not allow timelike conformal infinity to be attached , and therefore the entire spacetime would fail to be an asymptotically ads spacetime considered in the present context . ] .",
    "a version which has much wider applicability is the one proposed by hawking and penrose [ see theorem  2 in chapter 8 of @xcite ] , in which the condition  ( b ) requires , instead of global hyperbolicity , the chronology condition and the condition  ( c ) can be re - phrased as the existence of a future ( or past ) trapped set @xmath28 , an achronal set for which the horismos @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) is compact .",
    "then , under the convergence and generic conditions to null geodesics , one can construct a globally hyperbolic region @xmath26 which contains a future as well as past inextendible causal curve .",
    "now we argue that this version of the singularity theorems , which requires the existence of a closed trapped surface as a trapped set @xmath31 required in ( c ) , applies to the asymptotically ads case without any major change in its assumptions , as far as the stress - energy tensor for matter fields together with the negative cosmological constant , does not violate the null , as well as the timelike convergence property .",
    "the point is that in asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes the affine distance from any point in the spacetime to ads boundary along a null geodesic is infinite , even though the coordinate distance may be finite .",
    "therefore any outgoing null geodesics orthogonally emanating from the trapped surface , @xmath31 , must have a conjugate point with respect to @xmath31 before reaching ads - boundary , making the future horismos , @xmath32 , compact .",
    "then , there is no obstruction to apply ( corollary of ) lemma  8.2.1 of @xcite to show the existence of a future inextendible timelike curve @xmath19 contained in the globally hyperbolic region @xmath33 .",
    "then , again using the fact that ads - boundary is at affinely infinite distances along null geodesics from any point , we see that the past - inextendible extension of any null generating segment of @xmath34 must enter @xmath35 and have a past end point , thus making @xmath36 past - trapped : @xmath37 is compact .",
    "then , again applying lemma  8.2.1 of @xcite , we also have a past inextendible timelike curve @xmath38 in @xmath39 .     ,",
    "width=340 ]    note that to find the desired globally hyperbolic region @xmath40 we have used only the fact that in asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes the affine distance from any point in the spacetime to ads boundary along a null geodesic is infinite and that the convergence property of null geodesics is not affected by the presence of the negative cosmological constant .",
    "the rest of arguments concerning the maximum length non - spacelike curves in the globally hyperbolic region @xmath41 parallels the proof in hawking and ellis  @xcite , but for later discussion , we shall sketch the arguments . consider a sequence of points @xmath42 on @xmath38 , @xmath43 , so that @xmath44 tends to the past as @xmath45 , and similarly a sequence of points @xmath46 on @xmath19 tending to the future ,",
    ". then as @xmath48 are in @xmath26 , one can find a timelike geodesic , @xmath49 , from @xmath42 to @xmath50 , which maximizes the length from @xmath42 to @xmath50 .",
    "all @xmath49 cross the compact set @xmath51 , and therefore there exists a limit curve @xmath52 of @xmath53 , which must also be a timelike geodesic contained within @xmath22 . now",
    "if @xmath52 is incomplete , then we are done .",
    "if @xmath52 is complete , then @xmath52 must contain a pair of conjugate points due to the convergent condition ( a ) plus the timelike generic condition .",
    "this , however , implies that a timelike geodesic @xmath49 with sufficiently large @xmath13 would also have to admit a pair of conjugate points as conjugate points vary continuously .",
    "this is a contradiction against that @xmath49 was supposed to be the timelike curve of maximum length from @xmath42 to @xmath50 .    finally , we comment that the timelike convergence conditions assumed in the above arguments hold if , for any timelike vector @xmath10 , the stress - energy tensor @xmath54 for matter fields satisfies @xmath55 in fact , this is less restrictive than requiring @xmath54 alone to satisfy the standard strong energy condition , due to the last term . in other words ,",
    "the presence of @xmath56 enhances the timelike convergence @xmath57 via the einstein equations .",
    "thus we have seen the following version of the singularity theorem applies to asymptotically ads spacetimes :    * theorem . * [ hawking and penrose : ] +    _ a spacetime @xmath58 is not timelike and null geodesically complete if the following conditions hold : _    * @xmath57 for every non - spacelike vector @xmath10 , and the generic condition holds for every non - spacelike geodesic , i.e. , every non - spacelike geodesic has at least one point where @xmath59 \\alpha \\beta [ \\mu }             k_{\\sigma]}k^\\alpha k^\\beta \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "* the chronology condition holds .",
    "* there exists a closed trapped surface .",
    "note that the condition  ( c ) can be replaced with the other case : there exists a point for which light cones start reconverging .",
    "the non - linear instability of ads spacetime from arbitrarily small initial perturbations @xcite indicates that singularities may generically form without there being any strong gravity region on initial data surface and thus motivates us to consider if one can obtain a singularity theorem without the condition for strong gravity . in this subsection",
    "we will discuss some difficulties in eliminating the condition  ( c ) .",
    "the key point of the black hole formation from subcritical initial data in  @xcite is that the collapsing scalar field has to experience the process of bouncing - off at ads infinity many times to make its configuration supercritical .",
    "this is not possible within a single , globally hyperbolic region such as the diamond region of the cosmological chart in figure  [ flrw - chart ] .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a singularity theorem without condition  ( c ) , one has to deal with a non - globally hyperbolic ( sub)region .",
    "but then , the lack of global hyperbolicity falsifies standard arguments about the existence of maximum length geodesic curve in relevant region , which is one of the central ingredients of hawking and penrose s proof discussed in the previous section .",
    "let us consider this problem in a concrete example of pure ads spacetime @xmath23 .",
    "the ads metric can be expressed by the standard global chart , @xmath60 , in the static form @xmath61 this is conformally embedded into the einstein static universe @xmath62 , so that the conformal boundary @xmath63 is attached to @xmath64 as @xmath65 , and located at @xmath66 in @xmath67 .",
    "now consider two points @xmath0 and @xmath1 which respectively correspond to the big - bang / crunch point in the open flrw chart so that @xmath0 and @xmath1 form a pair of conjugate points .",
    "there are infinitely many timelike curves which maximize the length from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , in fact all timelike geodesics emanating from @xmath0 reach the point @xmath1 . therefore no causal curves on @xmath64 contained in @xmath25 reaches the ads conformal boundary . however ,",
    "as mentioned just above , the black hole formation is not realized in a region which correspond to a single globally hyperbolic patch .",
    "therefore , we are concerned with a pair of points @xmath0 and @xmath68 , as depicted in figure  [ length ] , for which @xmath69 contains a portion of @xmath63 . what we need to deal with is the causal curve that would maximize all causal curves connecting @xmath0 and @xmath68 .",
    "it turns out that the timelike geodesic from @xmath0 to @xmath68 along the line @xmath70 is no longer the one . to see this ,",
    "let us take a point @xmath9 on a null geodesic curve from @xmath0 to ads infinity .",
    "let @xmath71 be the coordinate value of @xmath72 at the point @xmath9 . then , move along @xmath73 line , which is not a geodesic , until the point @xmath20 as in figure  [ length ] , and move back to the center along a null geodesic to @xmath68 .",
    "thus we obtain a causal non - geodesic curve @xmath74 .",
    "one can easily evaluate the length of this path and show that this causal curve provides a longer length from @xmath0 to @xmath68 than the timelike geodesic along @xmath75 . since the null segment of this curve , those from @xmath0 to @xmath9 and @xmath20 to @xmath68 , does not add any length to the curve , we only focus on the timelike segment of the @xmath71 line from @xmath9 to @xmath20 . then , since the length is given by eq .",
    "( [ def : length ] ) , we have @xmath76 which can become arbitrarily large as @xmath77 .",
    "thus , by taking the timelike segment @xmath78 to be close to ads conformal boundary , the length of the causal curve from @xmath79 can be made arbitrarily large .",
    "this implies that there does not exist a causal curve that maximizes the length of all continuous causal curves from @xmath0 to @xmath68 .",
    "therefore even if one can show existence of inextendible causal curve in some region of ads spacetime , one can not apply the argument of a sequence of timelike geodesics @xmath49 to lead a contradiction .",
    ", width=94 ]    even in non - globally hyperbolic region , it might be possible to show the existence of maximum length curve between @xmath0 and @xmath68 , if , for instance , one introduces a cut off radius @xmath80 so that any causal curves are not allowed to approach ads conformal boundary beyond the cut - off coordinate value @xmath80 . in that case , however , the maximum length curve would fail to be geodesic , and we would not be able to apply general results concerning variation of arc - length , established for geodesic curves in chapter 4 of @xcite .      one way to avoid the issues that arise from the non - global hyperbolicity discussed above would be to consider a singularity theorem in some unphysical , globally hyperbolic spacetime , rather than in the physical asymptotically ads spacetime itself .",
    "namely , one attempts to    * construct a spatially compact unphysical spacetime from asymptotically ads spacetime in a way that ( i ) the timelike convergence and ( ii ) the generic conditions are satisfied in the unphysical spacetime , and * establish the relation between geodesic incompleteness in the unphysical spacetime and that in the physical asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "in fact , for a given asymptotically ads spacetime @xmath64 , one can first make a suitable conformal transformation to attach the boundary @xmath63 to have @xmath81 , and then make double @xmath67 and glue them together at the ads conformal boundaries @xmath63 . by doing",
    "so one can obtain a single connected spacetime @xmath82 with closed spatial section , just like the einstein static cylinder , to which one may be able to apply type of the singularity theorems for closed universe .",
    "since @xmath83 is spatially compact , any point or any subset @xmath84 would be a trapped set , as @xmath85 is compact in @xmath82 .",
    "then , it is straightforward to show that under condition ( a ) , the cauchy horizon for @xmath86 must be non - compact or empty , and find a globally hyperbolic region @xmath87 in @xmath83 that contains future and past inextendible timelike curve , say , @xmath19 .",
    "then , one may hope to apply the argument of maximum length curve of timelike geodesics @xmath49 to show the geodesic incompleteness of @xmath83 .",
    "however , the following would be a potential obstruction in this approach .",
    "the double cover is taken from an unphysical spacetime whose metric is conformally isometric to the original , physical metric .",
    "suppose one can find a suitable conformal transformation so that the timelike convergence conditions ( [ condi : timelike : convergence ] ) are satisfied in unphysical spacetime .",
    "a subtle issue arises in the neighborhood of the ads infinity @xmath63 in @xmath83 .",
    "since we impose the asymptotic ads boundary conditions at @xmath63 , we can find a neighborhood of @xmath63 which is isometric to a neighborhood of the @xmath88 line of the einstein static universe .",
    "then , it is straightforward to check that even on the neighborhood of the @xmath88 line , the timelike convergence condition ( [ condi : timelike : convergence ] ) is satisfied .",
    "however , there , the condition ( [ condi : timelike : convergence ] ) is only marginally satisfied , and the generic condition is actually not .",
    "hence the timelike geodesics that lie on the ads boundary , i.e. , those correspond to @xmath89 lines , do not contain a pair of conjugate points .",
    "therefore , even when one finds in @xmath90 , an inextendible causal curve @xmath52which may be of the lines @xmath91 itself  following the proof discussed in the previous section , one can not apply the remaining arguments using the sequence of timelike geodesics @xmath49 to lead a contradiction , as @xmath52 would not contain a pair of conjugate points on it .",
    "if we allow the ads conformal boundary @xmath63 to be dynamical and/or satisfy the generic condition in @xmath83 so that @xmath89 lines or @xmath52 can contain a pair of conjugate points , then the double covering approach may work . in the case , however , the asymptotic symmetries in the original spacetime might possibly break down .",
    "[ see e.g. @xcite , for various possible boundary conditions in asymptotically ads spacetimes . ]",
    "it would be interesting to clarify possible dynamical boundary conditions on ads conformal boundary that are generic enough so as to allow for the occurrence of a pair of conjugate points on every timelike geodesic in ads conformal boundary , and at the same time , stringent enough so as to allow meaningful notion of asymptotic structure of ads spacetimes .",
    "in the previous section  [ subsec : diff ] we have seen difficulties in removing condition for strong gravity ; without imposing the condition  ( c ) , the global method used in standard proof of the singularity theorems does not appear to work as we have to then deal with a non - globally hyperbolic region including part of ads conformal infinity , in which the argument about the existence of maximum length causal curves does not apply . in this section",
    "we take a different approach to singularity theorems : we restrict our attention to a specific class of asymptotically ads spacetimes and matter field . since we have already seen that , once a trapped set is formed , then hawking and penrose s theorem applies , the main purpose here is to show the occurrence of a trapped set in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "the numerical results of bizon and rostworowski  @xcite may be physically interpreted as follows .",
    "the dispersion of the scalar field increases during the time evolution and the amplitude tends to decrease when the wave packet travels toward the ads boundary .",
    "however , near the ads boundary , the effective potential makes the dispersion smaller by the reflection .",
    "then , after several reflection , the wave packet can become supercritical near the center of spherical symmetry and finally collapses to a black hole .",
    "some basic aspects of gravitational collapse can be described by the raychaudhuri equation for a congruence of non - spacelike curves .",
    "for example , let us consider an asymptotically ads gravity system composed of a dust fluid with energy density @xmath92 and a negative cosmological constant @xmath56 .",
    "then , a congruence of timelike geodesics obeys the raychaudhuri equation  ( [ eqn : raychaudhuri ] ) with @xmath93 .",
    "since all the terms in the right - hand side are non - positive , the expansion @xmath11 becomes larger and larger in negative along the geodesics , and nothing stops the congruence getting smaller and smaller toward a conjugate point .",
    "this means that as the flow lines of the dust are timelike geodesics that also obey ( [ eqn : raychaudhuri ] ) , the energy density blows up unboundedly toward the conjugate point , and a singularity eventually forms .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : raychaudhuri ] ) that the negative cosmological constant plays a role to enhance the gravitational contraction .    this simple argument",
    ", however , does not immediately apply to the case with other matter models such as massless scalar fields or perfect fluids since the energy flow lines or the histories of small particles with non - zero pressure are not geodesic ; they are accelerated . to be more precise , consider a perfect fluid in asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath0 be the energy density and pressure of the fluid and let @xmath94 be the unit tangent vector field along the flow lines  ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "then , the raychaudhuri equation of the congruence becomes @xmath96 the first term is non - negative under the strong energy condition .",
    "the last term describing the divergence of the acceleration , @xmath97 , of the flow lines is related to the pressure gradient , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq - perfectfluid2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the last term @xmath98 is not necessarily negative and can represent repulsion between the fluid lines when it is positive .",
    "therefore it is , in principle , possible that the last term and the others are balanced to realize an equilibrium , stationary configuration .",
    "it may be possible that even if the right - hand side is not always balanced and the expansion is negative at some initial time , it could change its sign to positive later on and the fluid lines would bounce off near the center and evolve outward . in this case , either the fluid bounces off at ads boundary and recollapses to form singularities , or the system could be dynamical but admit a discrete time symmetry , i.e. , it repeats expansion and contraction cyclically without ever forming singularities .    in the following",
    "we will show that for a certain class of matter fields , a singularity must inevitably form in spherically symmetric , asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "a key element of our argument is that as discussed above , the negative cosmological constant @xmath99 plays a role to effectively confine the system in an finite region characterized by its curvature radius .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the magnitude of the acceleration of the flow lines of matter fields should be bounded from above in certain sense so that the flow lines can never reach ads infinity but instead must always reflect back inward the spacetime . in eq .",
    "( [ raychaudhuri - eq : p - fluid ] ) . if we assume , for instance , the local condition , @xmath100 , then we are immediately done . to show our singularity theorem we shall adopt a much weaker condition , ( [ condi : averaged - convergence ] ) , than this.]then ,",
    "as can also be observed in bizon and rostworowski s massless scalar field system , we expect that even if the expansion of the matter flow lines can change its sign and gets positive , its time average over sufficiently large time interval ( at least larger than the time scale specified by the cosmological constant ) should be negative .",
    "if this is the case , then even though the flow lines of matter fields may have to bounce back and forth between the center of the spacetime and ads - boundary repeatedly , a large part of the flow lines will eventually enter a compact region near the center with sufficiently small radius ( compatible with the hoop conjecture ) and form a closed trapped surface .    from different point of view",
    ", it is expected that such a singularity formation in asymptotically ads spacetime occurs when the matter system under consideration admits no equilibrium configuration .",
    "the massless scalar field , for example , has no equilibrium configuration .",
    "on the other hand , charged fluid has an equilibrium configuration known as `` electron stars ''  @xcite . in the gravity system",
    "coupled to the charged fluid , dynamical instability will not occur , and hence the equilibrium configuration can be realized after the time evolution for any regular initial data except a particular case  .",
    "so , we will need to impose a kind of dynamical instability condition that ensures no equilibrium state to appear as an end state of the dynamical evolution .    in what follows",
    "we shall focus on spherically symmetric spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant @xmath56 and a perfect fluid with @xmath52 and @xmath0 being , respectively , the energy density and the pressure in four - dimensions .",
    "we assume that there is a regular , initial partial cauchy surface whose topology is @xmath101 as in the standard global ads spacetime .",
    "a generalization of our arguments below to higher dimensions should be straightforward .",

    "for later convenience , we shall adopt the following coordinate system @xmath102 where the time coordinate @xmath103 is taken along the fluid flow lines labelled by @xmath20 , so that the unit future - directed tangent vector field is given by @xmath104 . outside the support of the fluid",

    "assuming that @xmath94 is everywhere timelike and its orbits are complete , we shall show that a trapped region must form .",

    "so , we have a conservation law : @xmath115    since our main interest now on is the formation of a closed trapped surface in a spherically symmetric spacetime and thus concerns the behavior of the expansion @xmath11 of the fluid lines in the vicinity of the center , we shall consider below conditions that are required to hold for the fluid lines labelled by @xmath116 with some positive ( possibly sufficiently small ) value @xmath117 .",
    "at the same time , we are interested in situations in which the flow lines bounce off many times near the center by its pressure gradient and somewhere away from the center by the ads curvature .",
    "thus , we consider cases in which expansion of the fluid lines labelled by @xmath118 change many times its sign , minus for contraction and plus for expansion after bouncing off at the center .",

    "having seen that @xmath52 can become arbitrarily large near the center , we also see that the curvature near the center becomes arbitrarily large .",

    "this means that @xmath292 must admit zero , hence there must appear a trapped surface . @xmath293",
    "in this paper , we have considered singularity theorems in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "we first briefly reviewed the basics of singularity theorems and checked that hawking and penrose s theorems , which use the global methods to prove , apply to asymptotically ads spacetimes without major changes in its assumptions .",
    "motivated from the result of @xcite that indicates that in a spherically symmetric massless scalar field model , a black hole inevitably forms even starting from arbitrarily small initial perturbations after repeating the reflection at ads infinity many times , we have discussed if it is possible to show a singularity theorem in asymptotically ads spacetimes by taking into account the effect of the reflection back at ads infinity , and instead removing the requirement of a strong gravity region , i.e. , a trapped set , which is one of the essential requirements in hawking and penrose s singularity theorems .",
    "we have discussed main obstacles to do so in section  [ subsec : diff ] .",
    "then in the second part we have focused on the system of asymptotically ads gravity plus a perfect fluid with spherical symmetry and have investigated under what conditions a closed trapped surface generically appears in such a system . as seen in section  [ sec : basics ] once a closed trapped surface forms in asymptotically ads spacetime , the existence of a singularity can be shown under conditions used in hawking - penrose singularity theorems .",
    "we have shown that if the `` averaged convergence condition '' introduced in section  [ sec : sss ] is satisfied , a trapped surface necessarily forms , provided that the proper time @xmath9 of the fluid lines are complete , or the spacetime can be extended as far future from initial data as one wants .",
    "apart from that , there could be the case in which a singularity occurs without forming a closed trapped surface . in this case",
    "singularities that occur would be a naked one .",
    "thus , we conclude that a singularity generically appears in the spherically symmetric asymptotically ads spacetime for the perfect fluid system considered in section  [ sec : sss ] .",
    "the `` averaged convergence condition '' implies that the expansion of congruence for the fluid world lines changes its sign infinitely many times and the absolute value at each local minimum continues to increase as the spacetime dynamically evolves . as shown in section  [ sec : sss ] , this makes the dispersion of the energy density profile smaller and smaller indefinitely .",
    "it is noteworthy that imposing the `` averaged convergence condition '' does not necessarily mean by itself the existence of any strong gravity region or a high energy density region . in this sense",
    ", the condition is much weaker than the condition for the existence of a closed trapped surface , where a sufficiently large amount of mass should be enclosed in a small compact region",
    ".    it would be interesting to generalize our results here for the perfect fluid system to other matter field cases such as a massless or massive scalar field . to define the `` averaged convergence condition '' for the scalar field case",
    ", we need to define the notion of the energy flow lines of a scalar field",
    ". kodama vector field  @xcite , which can be defined for any spherically symmetric spacetimes , should be a candidate of such a vector field because , associated with it , one can always construct a conserved current",
    ".    it would be also interesting to explore under what circumstances , singularities are avoided to form in asymptotically ads spacetime . at first sight ,",
    "all known numerical and analytical results  @xcite combined with our results suggest that any matter fields satisfying physically reasonable energy conditions inevitably cause singularity formation in asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , this phenomenon can be interpreted as a turbulent instability in hydromechanics , which transfers energy to higher frequency , as mentioned in refs .",
    "on the other hand , it is well - known in the turbulent phenomena that there is also an `` inverse cascade phenomenon '' which transfers energy to lower frequency . in the gravity side ,",
    "if repulsive force is much stronger than attractive force for a matter field , such an inverse cascade phenomenon might occur since singularity formation would be avoided due to the large repulsive force . to answer this question",
    ", it would be worth investigating a charged perfect fluid in which the charge density is much bigger than the mass density .",
    "if the repulsive force is stronger than the attractive force , a periodic solution might be possible , as the charged fluid can not escape to ads infinity or collapse to a singularity .",
    "[ see e.g. @xcite for a different approach to the problem . ] to pursue these possibilities , we need to investigate , by concerted efforts of both numerical and analytical methods , non - linear dynamics for a variety of matter fields in asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "we wish to thank vitor cardoso , oscar dias , jorge santos , helvi witek for valuable discussions .",
    "we would especially like to thank gary t.  horowitz for valuable discussions , in particular , on the non - existence of maximum length curve and the need of cut - off radius discussed in section  [ subsec : diff ] as well as on the occurrence of a closed trapped surface in the last part of section  [ sec : sss ] .",
