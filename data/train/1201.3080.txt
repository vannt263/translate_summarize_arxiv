    "the quantitative description of real - time dynamics in strongly correlated systems is one of the outstanding challenges of contemporary condensed - matter physics , with relevance to varied systems ranging from cold atoms  @xcite and dissipative systems  @xcite to quantum - dot devices  @xcite and biological donor - acceptor molecules .",
    "@xcite alongside fundamental question concerning the underlying time scales and the long - time behavior , there are many technological issues that require careful investigation . for example , the decoherence and relaxation of spins appears to be the major obstacle for the realization of quantum - computing algorithms in real systems .",
    "@xcite another key issue is the understanding of coherent control and the switching characteristics of nanodevices such as single - electron transistors .",
    "@xcite these and related topics require the development and application of suitable many - body techniques .",
    "@xcite    over the years , the kadanoff - baym  @xcite and keldysh  @xcite techniques have proven to be accurate tools for describing the real - time dynamics of weakly correlated systems such as light - matter interaction in semiconductors  @xcite and the decoherence and relaxation of an impurity spin well above the kondo temperature .",
    "@xcite geared toward perturbation theory , these techniques generally fail upon the development of strong correlations , when nonperturbative approaches are in order . a case in point",
    "are quantum dots tuned to the kondo regime,@xcite where traditional diagrammatic - based approximations are unsuitable to describe the nonequilibrium state.@xcite the difficulty lies in the fact that strongly correlated systems change their nature as a function of certain control parameters such as the temperature or the coupling constants , an aspect well captured by renormalization - group approaches.@xcite the precise status of a voltage bias as yet another control parameter in interacting nanostructures is still under debate .",
    "recent years have witnessed an impressive advancement of numerical techniques aimed at tracking the real - time dynamics of strongly correlated systems , primarily with the development of the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group ( td - dmrg ) .",
    "@xcite yet while the adaptive td - dmrg works remarkably well on time scales of order the reciprocal bandwidth , it is presently unsuited for tackling longer time scales due to an accumulated error that grows first linearly and then exponentially with the time elapsed .",
    "alternative formulations  @xcite of the td - dmrg circumvent the accumulated error , but are simply too demanding to advance to long times .",
    "recent adaptations of continuous - time monte carlo techniques to real - time dynamics  @xcite are free of finite - size effects , but are confined to short time scales due to an inherent sign problem .",
    "the chebyshev expansion technique ,  @xcite developed by tal ezer and kosloff ,  @xcite offers yet another extremely powerful approach for tracking the time evolution of finite - size systems .",
    "however , it too is quite limited in accessing long time scales in the presence of interactions due to the exceedingly large hilbert space that must be retained .",
    "a complementary approach is provided by the time - dependent numerical renormalization group ( td - nrg ) .",
    "@xcite the td - nrg can successfully bridge over vastly different time scales , but is far more restrictive in the systems and perturbations to which it can be applied . a composite approach that combines the complementary traits of the different techniques mentioned above",
    "is highly desirable .    in this paper",
    ", we devise such a hybrid approach that combines the outstanding capabilities of the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) to systematically construct the effective low - energy hamiltonian of the system  @xcite with the prowess of complementary approaches for calculating the real - time dynamics derived from this hamiltonian .",
    "typically strongly correlated systems possess multiple energy scales that markedly differ in magnitude , hence their dynamics is governed by vastly different time scales . this spread of time scales , which may differ by many orders of magnitude , poses an enormous obstacle for most computational approaches .",
    "the td - nrg is quite unique in this respect as it can efficiently bridge between the different time scales .",
    "our hybrid approach presented below provides a flexible platform for combining the td - nrg with one s method of choice for treating the effective low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "possible choices for the complementary method could be exact diagonalization , the td - dmrg , and possibly also the time - dependent noncrossing approximation .",
    "@xcite here we shall demonstrate the applicability of our approach by combining the td - nrg with the chebyshev expansion technique ( cet ) , providing thereby an important proof of principle .",
    "the basic philosophy underlying the hybrid - nrg is to first exhaust the td - nrg in order to decompose the time - dependent wave function into distinct components , each associated with a separate time scale and evolving according to its own reduced hamiltonian acting on a suitable subspace of the full fock space .",
    "each of the individual components with its associated hamiltonian can then be treated with improved accuracy using , e.g. , the td - dmrg or cet . in this manner",
    "one can exploit the successive reduction in energy scales in order to boost the td - dmrg and cet to long time scales that otherwise would be inaccessible to either of these methods .",
    "concomitantly , the accuracy and flexibility of the td - nrg are greatly enhanced , as we demonstrate by extending the approach to the physically relevant case of repeated switchings .",
    "the hybrid platform further offers an appealing way to reduce discretization errors inherent to the wilson chain by converting to hybrid chains .",
    "the idea to use the nrg level flow to construct effective hamiltonians is , of course , not new .",
    "dating back to the original work of wilson ,  @xcite this framework has been significantly advanced by hewson  @xcite who used it as a starting point for devising a renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "hewson s approach requires , however , analytical knowledge of the form of the low - energy hamiltonian and its associated quantum field theory .",
    "so far it has been applied mainly to the single - impurity anderson model , where it was used , among other things , to calculate the steady - state current  @xcite in the limit of a small bias voltage .",
    "our approach is far more general as it makes no assumption on the analytical form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "rather , it is solemnly based on wilson s original concept  @xcite that the nrg level flow contains all accessible information , and in particular can accurately describe the crossover region between two distinct fixed points ( a regime which generally lies outside the reach of perturbative methods ) .",
    "our framework exclusively uses the sequence of diagonalized nrg hamiltonians ,  @xcite circumventing thereby any prejudice on the form of the effective hamiltonian . as a result",
    "our method is model independent , relying solely on the nrg approach itself .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the original td - nrg algorithm from a single quantum quench to multiple switchings , which requires an additional approximation beyond the one underlying the conventional td - nrg . as we demonstrate by explicit calculations ,",
    "the quality of the approximation can be systematically improved by enlarging the subspace treated using the complementary method .      in the td - nrg",
    ", the continuous bath is represented by a discretized wilson chain ,  @xcite characterized by tight - binding hopping matrix elements that decay exponentially along the chain .",
    "this separation of energy scales enables access to exponentially long time scales  @xcite that otherwise would be inaccessible using ordinary tight - binding chains . in analyzing the accuracy of the td - nrg",
    "it is important to distinguish between two sources of error : one extrinsic due to the discretized representation of the continuous bath in terms of a wilson chain , and the other intrinsic due to the td - nrg algorithm for tracking the real - time dynamics on the wilson chain .     in the resonant - level model following a sudden quench of the level energy from @xmath0 to @xmath1 at time @xmath2 .",

    ", one can decrease the deviations from the continuum limit and delay them to a later time by reducing the wilson discretization parameter @xmath10 . at the same time , the deviations are hardly affected by prolonging the chain length @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to two important conclusions : ( i ) the main source of error in the td - nrg is extrinsic rather than intrinsic ;  @xcite ( ii ) the exponentially decaying tight - binding matrix elements , which lie at the heart of the nrg ,  @xcite are also the limiting factor for reproducing the continuum - limit result for the quench dynamics .    to understand the source of the deviations from the continuum - limit result , we note that globally conserved quantities such as the charge or the spin of the system are locally connected by the continuity equation to associated charge and spin currents .",

    "<S> the time - dependent numerical renormalization - group approach ( td - nrg ) , originally devised for tracking the real - time dynamics of quantum - impurity systems following a single quantum quench , is extended to multiple switching events . </S>",
    "<S> this generalization of the td - nrg encompasses the possibility of periodic switching , allowing for coherent control of strongly correlated systems by an external time - dependent field . to this end , we have embedded the td - nrg in a hybrid framework that combines the outstanding capabilities of the numerical renormalization group to systematically construct the effective low - energy hamiltonian of the system with the prowess of complementary approaches for calculating the real - time dynamics derived from this hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the power of our approach by hybridizing the td - nrg with the chebyshev expansion technique in order to investigate periodic switching in the interacting resonant - level model . </S>",
    "<S> although the interacting model shares the same low - energy fixed point as its noninteracting counterpart , we surprisingly find the gradual emergence of damped oscillations as the interaction strength is increased . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on a single quantum quench and using a strong - coupling analysis , we reveal the origin of these interaction - induced oscillations and provide an analytical estimate for their frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the latter agrees well with the numerical results . </S>"
