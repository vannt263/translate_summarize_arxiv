    "the concept of impulse response tensor of an isotropic turbulent flow lies at the heart of the direct interaction approximation ( dia ) theory , developed 50 years ago @xcite by the great theoretical physicist robert kraichnan , to tackle the turbulence closure problem analytically . since then , within the renormalized perturbations approach , several closure strategies have been proposed ( a significant example is the local energy transfer ( let ) theory introduced by mccomb @xcite ) , eventually adopting a lagrangian viewpoint , as done by kraichnan himself @xcite and others @xcite . in all such theories , either eulerian or lagrangian ,",
    "closure is achieved by means of a closed set of integro - differential equations , where the unknowns are the two - points , two - times velocity correlation tensor and the response tensor itself .",
    "an exception is let , where the response tensor is replaced by a renormalized propagator tensor which connects the velocity correlations at different times , in close analogy with the well known fluctuation - dissipation relation of the classical statistical physics .",
    "recently , mccomb and kiyani @xcite have shown how a renormalized response tensor relating the two - point covariance at different times can be derived ; the corresponding relationship reduces to a fdr form , still within the theoretical framework of second - order renormalized perturbations , by introducing the so called time ordering approach to reconcile the time - symmetry of the correlation with the causality of the response .    during the last decades , several statistics of homogeneous isotropic turbulence ( hit ) , either computed with well resolved direct numerical simulations or obtained from experiments , have been compared to the corresponding theoretical predictions at increasing values of @xmath0 @xcite , in the statistically stationary as well as in the freely decaying regime .",
    "encouraging results both for the let theory and various lagrangian closures have been reported @xcite .",
    "up to the present day , however , such a comparison for the impulse response function has never been addressed , owing to the lack of ( experimental or numerical ) information about it .",
    "missing such a comparison is not a minor issue for eulerian closure theories : as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the differences among the various theoretical approaches have their roots in the form of the response or propagator equation , whereas the covariance equation is most often treated in equivalent ways .",
    "furthermore , if the response and the two - point covariance were available , the degree of approximation involved in using the fdr in the context of hit could be straightforwardly evaluated , indirectly gathering information about the invariant probability distribution of the turbulent system @xcite .    in recent years",
    "luchini _ et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed an original method to carry out an eulerian dns - based measurement of the mean impulse response of a turbulent flow , and have described the response function of a fully developed turbulent channel flow to small - amplitude perturbations applied at the wall .",
    "that study was conceived in the framework of turbulence control ( hence the emphasis on wall flows and wall forcing ) ; due to lack of isotropy , the response tensor is quite complicated , and does not directly relate to the previous isotropic theories .",
    "however , the proposed measurement technique provides us with the required tools to obtain the impulse response tensor for hit , where the response function shall be intended to describe the response of turbulence to volume forcing .",
    "the present paper therefore aims at measuring the eulerian hit response , presenting preliminary results , obtained at low values of @xmath0 , that will enable us to analyze the characteristic form and time scales of the response , and to compare them with theoretical predictions and assumptions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next  [ sec : measure ] , the definition of the impulse response is briefly reviewed to introduce the measurement technique , that is numerically validated against the available analytical viscous solution , and to discuss accuracy issues . in  [ sec : results ] the actual response function is presented and analyzed with reference to the theoretical background of renormalized perturbations and fdr .",
    "[ sec : concl ] is devoted to a concluding discussion .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the most general definition in wave vector space @xmath1 of the instantaneous impulse response tensor of a turbulent velocity field @xmath2 to an external volume force @xmath3 , is given by the following input - output relationship between infinitesimal perturbations , @xmath4 ( note the different notation from the dirac delta function @xmath5 ) : @xmath6    it is important to underline that perturbations here assume a stochastic meaning , since they are superimposed to a particular random realization of @xmath7 , which itself is solution of the fully non - linear navier - stokes equations ( nse ) in fourier space .",
    "therefore @xmath8 possesses a random nature , and an integral formulation not only in time but also in wave - vector space is required .",
    "in fact the instantaneous response tensor plays the role of a tangent green s function , related to a random and nonlinear state , and satisfies the instantaneous response equation :    @xmath9    which can be derived through a stochastic green function formalism applied to the linearized form of fourier transformed nse . in eq .",

    "a numerical code has been developed on purpose and equipped with parallel ( shared - memory ) computing capabilities .",

    "@xcite luchini , quadrio & zuccher propose an innovative method for measuring the linear impulse response of a turbulent velocity field , resorting to the statistical statement of the input - output relation for a linear system , i.e. _ the input - output correlation_. this approach is primarily motivated by the problem of low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) that one would face , should the response function be measured according to its definition .",
    "indeed the linear response of a non - linear dynamical system is obtained by means of infinitesimal perturbations around an equilibrium state , which has a stochastic meaning in the description of turbulence .",
    "therefore impulsive perturbations externally introduced into the turbulent field to measure its linear response must be extremely small compared to the natural turbulent fluctuations for eq .",
    "( [ eq : resp - def ] ) to hold ; as a consequence , their effect is buried into turbulent noise .    by definition",
    "the impulse response is the output of a linear system when either harmonic or impulsive signals are used as inputs .",
    "however , for a linearized turbulent system , the use of a proper statistical probe instead of a deterministic one will dramatically improve the computational efficiency of the overall measurement procedure .",
    "this is the case of using a white - noise process in input to the system .",
    "indeed it is well known from filtering theory @xcite that when a linear system is fed with white noise , the correlation between the input and the output is proportional to the impulse response of the system , owing to the delta - correlated property of the white - noise process .",
    "we employ an externally generated random volume forcing as the input ; by computing its cross - correlation with the velocity field , the whole wave - number dependency of the response function is obtained at once . at the same time , forcing is uniformly distributed over time and space , thus leading to improved s / n and larger allowed amplitudes within the linearity constraint .",
    "therefore this strategy performs much better than a deterministic forcing , be it either harmonic or impulsive , that would lead to computationally unaffordable simulations , as highlighted in ref .",

    "( [ eq : input - output - corr - expl ] ) . in this way",
    "it is still possible to measure the turbulent response using the cross - correlation between the white - noise input and the whole turbulent velocity field .    at this point",
    "it may be useful to note explicitely that no relation exists between the energy - driving forcing , eq .",
    "( [ eq : forcing ] ) , and the white - noise forcing applied for the response measurement , eq .",
    "( [ eq : noise ] ) .",
    "the former obviuosly represent a mere artificial , but unavoidable , mechanism to drive the flow and maintain statistical stationarity , via supply of energy at large scales .",
    "the white noise , on the other hand , is an external field of volume force that enters the stationary turbulent system , which includes the energy - driving forcing .",

    "( [ eq : noise ] ) : the identity covariance scaling factor for @xmath42 could be easily embedded in the definition of @xmath58 without losing of generality . ]",
    "hence the white noise is independent from both the turbulent fluctuations and the energy - driving forcing applied to them through the feedback formula ( [ eq : forcing ] ) .",
    "a feedback forcing loop should be considered when looking at the linear response for wave numbers contained in the forced shell , but , as already discussed , these are not of physical interest .    in the hit case",
    "( [ eq : resp - isodef ] ) provides us with a convenient way of accumulating just the simple scalar version of the response tensor , by means of shell averaging over tensor trace : @xmath59    when measuring @xmath60 , a proper spatial and temporal discretization must be adopted . while in a dns the discretizazion in @xmath61 is easily derived from the fourier representation of the velocity field ( as for the energy spectrum @xmath62 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the definition of the @xmath63-step is less obvious .",
    "both the time resolution of the white - noise delta correlation , @xmath64 , i.e. the time interval between successive updates of the random numbers , and the averaging time @xmath65 , i.e. the time interval over which statistics are computed , must be chosen such that @xmath16 is properly described and at the same time the computational requirements of the numerical simulation are kept reasonable .",
    "if @xmath66 indicates the smallest time scale at which proper convergence of the response is sought , @xmath67 must be chosen so that @xmath68 . assuming uniform sampling of the response in @xmath69 time instants separated by @xmath70 , the time horizon available to represent the decay of the entire response must be greater than the whole response decay time @xmath71 at the lower wave number in the range of interest , i.e. @xmath72 .",
    "proper convergence of the average response obviously requires @xmath73 . indeed , while @xmath74 controls @xmath75 resolution and then @xmath76 , i.e. the time integration step , the largest inertial wave number dictates @xmath69 and @xmath65 .",
    "given such contrasting requirements , characterizing the function @xmath60 in the whole universal range of scales via a sole measurement is possible but computationally demanding .",
    "hence the entire function @xmath60 can be measured through more than one uniform @xmath63-grid , so that the response is probed within several sub - ranges of scales , leveraging their reduced extent .",
    "@xmath60 is then measured in a wide range of scales via a limited number of dns runs , each of which requires roughly the same computational effort .",
    "these simulations are independent , and can be run simultaneously if the available computing power allows .",
    "however , for the results to obey the linearity costraint , the level of the introduced `` noise energy '' , @xmath77 , must be kept constant across the different @xmath70 resolutions adopted at different scales .",
    "this means that a larger @xmath70 implies a reduced noise amplitude @xmath58 and a longer averaging time .",
    "this is partially compensated by the larger time step size allowed by the time resolution of the response at lower wave numbers .",

    "one possible explanation might be provided by considering the energy - convection effects as a feature of turbulence that remains limited to the dissipative subrange of scales , so that the presence of significant scale separation from the energy scales would let the random convection picture to hold : however the same could not be true for inertial scales at higher @xmath0 .    a more thorough description of the response function and of its relevant time scales , together with a precise assessment of the approximations involved by the classical fdr , obviously call for an extension of the present study towards much higher values of @xmath0 , so that a well - defined inertial range can develop .",
