    "the study of phase transitions has been one of the main subjects in physics since the introduction of the ising model @xcite mainly aimed to explain the phenomenon of spontaneous magntization in ferromagnet ( fm ) . in general , a phase transition is associated with a symmetry breaking @xcite ; occurs due to the competition between coupling interaction and thermal energy .",
    "systems are in high degree of symmetry at high temperature because all configurational spaces are accessible .",
    "the decrease in temperature will reduce thermal fluctuation and the system will stay in some favorable states . if the phase transition occurs with no latent heat , the system experiences continuous transition ,",
    "also known as second order phase transition , which is a transition between the ordered and the disordered state .",
    "the order of phase transition of a system is frequently not quite obvious and sometimes becomes a subject of debate . in this paper , we focus on the phase transition of @xmath0-state potts model . it is a magnetic model applicable to many physical systems such as polycrystalline material , simple fluids , percolation problems , etc.@xcite this model is a generalization of ising model which is known to exhibit second order phase transition for @xmath3-dimensional case , with @xmath4 .",
    "the order of phase transition of @xmath0-state potts models varies with @xmath0 and the spatial dimensions as well as the spin coupling interaction .",
    "it is well known that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) fm case of the model experiences second order phase transition for @xmath5 , and first order for otherwise . in 3d case , the model experiences first order transition for @xmath6 .",
    "the anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) potts model is considered to be more complex than the fm case as its behaviour depends strongly on the microscopic lattice structure . a systematic study of 3d af case by yamaguchi and okabe reported that the phase transition is second order for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "there exists zero temperature transition for @xmath9 and for @xmath10 no order found at any temperatures @xcite .",
    "recently , tamura _ et al .",
    "_ studied @xmath11-state potts , which is a @xmath0-state potts model with @xmath1 invisible redundant states@xcite .",
    "the invisible states of the model affect the entropy but do not contribute to the internal energy .",
    "although this model is a straightforward extension of the standard ferromagnetic potts model , due to the effect of invisible states , a spontaneous @xmath0 fold symmetry breaking of a first order phase transition can occur in 2d case for @xmath12 , and @xmath8 . for each @xmath0 ,",
    "there is a critical value of @xmath1 which can change the second order transition of the corresponding standard @xmath0-state potts model into a first order .",
    "thus , it is of theoretical interest to determine this critical value of @xmath1 .",
    "several methods are used for the analysis of phase transition .",
    "an example of this is the usage of probability distribution function combined with the histogram reweighting for the analysis of first - order transition . for this type of transition , the multicanonical monte carlo method calculating the energy density of states ( dos ) was shown to be effective @xcite .",
    "quite recently , komura and okabe @xcite studied the difference of dos , @xmath13 , and examined the behavior of the first - order transition with this quantity in connection with maxwell s equal area rule .",
    "the paper elaborates the analysis of the density of state difference ( dosd ) obtained from wang - landau algorithm @xcite in determining the order of phase transition of the 2d @xmath11-state potts model .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the model and the method .",
    "the result is discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the summary and concluding remark .",
    "the @xmath11-state potts model is written with the following hamiltonian @xmath14 for any spin configuration , the potts spin @xmath15 on site i-@xmath16 can take one of @xmath17 states , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively referred to as colored states and invisible states .",
    "the standard potts models is recovered if @xmath20 .",
    "summation is performed over all the nearest - neighbor pairs of spins on a square lattice with ferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath21 ) and with periodic boundary condition .",
    "if two neighboring spins take the same state , then the energy coupling is @xmath22 , otherwise it becomes zero .",
    "it is to be noticed that even if two neighboring spins are equal , the energy remains zero if spins are in invisible state , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the ground state energy is @xmath24 with @xmath25 is the number of spins .",
    "-state potts model @xmath26 with @xmath27 for linear system size @xmath28.,width=224 ]    monte carlo simulation is a standard method used in many field of physics , including the study of phase transition of magnetic models . here",
    ", we use wang - landau algorithm to calculate the dos of the models .",
    "this algorithm is particularly powerful for this purpose .",
    "it has been implementend in various type of systems , such af potts model @xcite and fully frustrated clock model @xcite . from the calculated dos",
    "@xmath29 , we can straightforward obtain dosd defined as @xmath30 for the considered model , @xmath31 , and the total energy takes the value between @xmath24 and @xmath32 , where @xmath25 is the number of spins . however , for the convenience of the numerical simulation , we shifted the energy so that it takes the value between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "a general procedure of determining the order of transition using dosd was described by komura and okabe @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a system exhibiting first - order transition will have an s - like structure in the plot of @xmath34 .",

    "as has been described , the 2d @xmath0-state potts model undergoes second - order phase transition for @xmath5 and first order for otherwise .",
    "we should show this behaviour using dosd before presenting the results for @xmath11-state potts model .",
    "the dos of standard @xmath0-state potts model for @xmath7 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ gmb01a ] .",
    "this type of figure is typical of dos in regular magnetic systems where density of ground state is much less than that of excited states . obtaining the data of any physical quantity for every state ,",
    "expressed as @xmath36 which can be referred as to density of quantity , we can calculate ensemble average @xmath37 via the following relation @xmath38 this equation implies the forthcoming of wang - landau algorithm as one can obtain the value of @xmath39 at any temperature . in addition , from the same data of simulation one can obtain by - product results for anti - ferromagnetic system , namely by changing the energy @xmath40 into @xmath41 .",
    "this is demonstrated in the study of ferromagnetic @xmath42-state clock model for various 2d lattices @xcite . from the data of dos , shown in fig .",

    "the presence of s - like structure is an essential indication of the first order transition.,width=240 ]    let us examine the meaning of @xmath34 .",
    "this quantity is related to the inverse of temperature in the microcanonical scheme where we have @xmath56 in the continuum limit .",

    "[ gmb02 ] is nothing but @xmath60 versus @xmath59 plot ; it is to be noted that for discrete energy models such as the potts model there is an oscillating behavior for low dos region due to the discreteness as was shown in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with the temperature dependence of the ensemble average of energy , @xmath61 following definition of eq .",

    "the s - like structure shown by solid curve , in the microcanonical scheme leads to the negative specific heat , or the thermodynamic instability .",
    "then , the canonical average of energy , which is shown by dotted curve , has a jump at the first - order transition temperature due to maxwell s equal area rule .",
    "when the system size increases from 32 to 64 , the behavior of s - like structure approaches that of the thermodynamic limit ; that is , the line to express the energy jump becomes horizontal .",
