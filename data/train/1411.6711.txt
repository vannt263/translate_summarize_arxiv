    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic transients observed at cosmological distances .",
    "they have been categorised into two classes . the first class , `",

    "are linked to the core collapse of massive stars ( collapsars ) @xcite . for several cases ,",
    "the grbs are firmly associated with type ib / c supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting they are linked to the end of massive stellar evolution .",
    "in contrast short grbs ( @xmath8 s hereafter sgrb ) have a less certain origin .    the first breakthrough to understand the origin of sgrbs occurred in 2005 after the launch of the nasa _ swift _ satellite @xcite .",
    "prompt localizations and deep afterglow searches yielded the first redshifts and investigations of their progenitor environments based on their host galaxies . by 2014",
    ", about three dozen sgrbs had been localized by _ swift _ and about 50% have optical detections with redshift determinations",
    ".    binary neutron star mergers ( ns - ns ) or neutron star ",
    "black hole ( ns - bh ) mergers are the favoured progenitors for sgrbs , based on the association of some sgrbs with an older stellar population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as compared to lgrbs .",
    "further evidence for the origin of sgrbs comes from observations showing that at least some sgrbs occur far from their site of origin , a consequence of possible high velocity kicks imparted to nss at birth .",
    "although the bi - modal distribution is accepted as evidence for two grb classifications , there remains ambiguity . about 20% of _ swift _ sgrbs",
    "have been detected with an extended emission lasting up to 100s ( hereafter sgrb - ee ) @xcite leading to suggestions that different progenitor types produce these bursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that sgrb - ee could be ns - bh mergers based on their galaxy off - sets or the birth of a rapidly rotating proto - magnetar produced via ns - ns merger or accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the standard synchrotron model describes the relationship between afterglow luminosity and isotropic kinetic energy of the prompt emission ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "previous studies that have investigated this correlation for lgrbs include e.g. @xcite . for sgrbs ,",
    "studies include @xcite , who used the x - ray luminosity at 10 hours ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also @xcite , who analysed both the optical @xmath10band and x - ray luminosity at 11 hours .",
    "in addition to these studies , recent investigations of correlations between afterglow luminosity and @xmath9 include @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter k10 ) analysed how the optical flux density in the @xmath11 band at one day ( in the host frame assuming @xmath12 ) is correlated with @xmath0 for a sample of lgrbs . while no tight correlation was identified , they found a general trend of increasing optical luminosity with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "k10 provided a best fit to the correlation , and find that @xmath13 , which is significantly shallower than the standard synchrotron model predicts i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite performed a similar analysis , but included 28 sgrbs x - ray and optical afterglows .",
    "x - ray luminosities were calculated at a fiducial rest - frame time of 11 hr in the @xmath15 kev band ( @xmath16 ) as a function of the isotropic - equivalent @xmath17-ray energy ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the study showed that the observed correlations are flatter than the theoretical expectation , similar to that identified by k10 .",
    "@xcite , claim they have obtained a _",
    "complete _ selection of _ swift _ lgrbs by applying a high cut - off in grb peak photon flux to minimize flux bias .",
    "they show that the x - ray afterglow luminosity vs @xmath0 correlation evolves from strongest at early times to weakest at late times . despite this high - energy flux limit",
    ", they acknowledge that their _ complete _ grb x - ray luminosity sample is still biased , and apply a joint correlation method to account for the malmquist bias correlation between redshift and luminosity .",
    "fig 2 shows that a cut in @xmath17-ray peak photon flux does not remove the redshift bias in their x - ray luminosity distribution .",
    "given the importance of testing the standard synchrotron model using multi - wavelength grb data , we re - examine the @xmath18 correlation .",
    "our main focus is understanding how selection biases in the grb afterglow distribution influence the @xmath18 correlation .",
    "we will apply robust methods to first identify flux limited biases ( malmquist ) in grb optical and x - ray afterglow data , and secondly , remove this bias to construct a bias free selection .",
    "finally , we compare the unbiased lgrb and sgrb optical and x - ray luminosities with the standard synchrotron model .",
    "the standard afterglow synchrotron model uses free parameters that describe the relativistic shock microphysics : the fraction of post - shock energy in the magnetic fields , @xmath6 , the fraction of energy in relativistic electrons , @xmath19 .",
    "these parameters follow a power - law distribution i.e. @xmath20 above a minimum lorentz factor , @xmath21 @xcite .    in the standard afterglow synchrotron model , the x - ray band",
    "is expected to be located near or above the synchrotron cooling frequency @xcite .",
    "the afterglow x - ray flux ( assuming a fiducial value for @xmath22 ) is given by : @xmath23 for the optical afterglow flux , the synchrotron model predicts that the optical band is below the synchrotron cooling frequency so that : @xmath24    there are several observational consequences for the two spectral regimes .",
    "firstly , the x - ray luminosity should be independent of @xmath25 and @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , the distributions of the microphysical parameters will introduce scatter in the afterglow luminosity and @xmath9 correlation , and in the optical band , @xmath25 and @xmath6 should introduce additional scatter . for the x - ray band , @xmath26 is a reasonable proxy for the more directly relevant , but not directly measurable @xmath9 .    in the context of this work ( and other studies )",
    "it is important to consider the effect of the malmquist bias on the @xmath27 correlation using different data selections . for a highly biased sample , where the malmquist correlation is significant , the intrinsic e@xmath1 ",
    "l@xmath2 correlation can be falsely increased , because both @xmath0 and afterglow luminosity are both determined from flux limited ( redshift dependent ) observations .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is biased by the sensitivity of _ swift _ , producing a positive @xmath28 correlation . secondly ,",
    "the afterglow luminosity distribution is biased by telescope sensitivity .",
    "this affect is strongest in the optical ( see table figure 1 . ) , because redshifts for lgrbs are mostly obtained directly from the optical afterglow ( not the host galaxy ) ; this causes a bias for sampling the optically brightest part of the @xmath29 distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the two independent variables ( ignoring the standard synchrotron model for now ) , @xmath30 and @xmath0 , are forced to correlate positively via redshift , but possibly only limits for any intrinsic correlations can be inferred @xcite .",
    "lgrb and srgb optical luminosities , are obtained from k10 and references therein .",
    "our optical data selection taken from k10 includes 61 lgrb optical afterglow absolute magnitudes measured at 24 hr in the rest frame .",
    "based on @xcite , we classify a subset of sgrbs as sgrb - ee in this sample .",
    "x - ray luminosities are calculated using light curves from the _ swift_-xrt light curve repository @xcite .",
    "we used an interpolation procedure using flux data in the light curves to find both x - ray luminosities and uncertainties at 11 hr .",
    "burst classifications are based on the scheme from @xcite with redshifts taken from the jochen greiner online catalogue of localized grbs .",
    "we note the classification and redshifts in this catalogue are subject to ongoing updates .",
    "to ensure a consistent sample of @xmath31 data , we use the butler online catalogue _",
    "swift _ bat integrated spectral parameters .",
    "this catalogue , an extension of @xcite , circumvents the nominal bat upper energy of 150 kev to produce values of @xmath31 through a bayesian approach .",
    "we note that butler provides no @xmath31 data for grbs 061006 , 061210 and 071112c , so we use estimates provided by k10 .     and",
    "@xmath32 , obtained by an iterative procedure that minimizes the correlation ( malmquist bias ) . alternatively , the selection @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( red circles ) , is dominated by the malmquist bias , demonstrated by a significant correlation with a spearman s probability of a random correlation @xmath33 . similarly , but independently , @xmath0 is biased by the sensitivity of _ swift _ , producing a positive @xmath28 correlation ( see table 1 ) . ]    ) between x - ray luminosity and redshift , a result of a strong malmquist bias ( flux limited bias ) , as shown in figure 1 . *",
    "bottom * same as top panel , but using the _ complete _ sample from , which was obtained by applying a cut - off in the high energy flux and other observation based selection criteria .",
    "both data selections are equally dominated by the same malmquist bias ( spearman @xmath34 ) . ]    [ fig2 ]        we minimize the malmquist bias for lgrb optical afterglows using two joint selection criteria : @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; i.e. the limiting redshift and apparent magnitude respectively .",
    "they are obtained by incrementally reducing the maximum allowable redshift ( volume ) and magnitude ( flux limit ) until the correlation between luminosity and redshift is insignificant ( i.e. spearman s @xmath37 ) . using this procedure",
    "we obtain 24 samples , the optically unbiased sample . for the optical afterglow",
    "luminosity data , the optimal selection criteria that minimizes the bias are : @xmath32 and @xmath38 .",
    "we also tested a high energy grb peak flux cut - off , similar to , and find that the bias in afterglow luminosity vs redshift is not removed .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] plots optical luminosity vs redshift using the malmquist bias corrected sample , and the highly biased sample : @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    ". summarises the correlations and their significance . after applying the selection criteria above",
    ", we find that the correlation between @xmath29 and equivalent isotropic energy @xmath0 in the 24 hr rest frame is significantly weakened and statistically not significant ( spearman @xmath39 ) . alternatively",
    ", we find that the e@xmath1 ",
    "l@xmath2 correlation for the data selection @xmath4 and @xmath3 ( biased sample ) is significant , with spearman @xmath33 . to test this result for small number statistics ( last column table 1 . )",
    "we applied a random sampling of 10 events from the full @xmath29 data set , and find that the probability that the observed spearman s @xmath40 is not because of random sampling is about 97% .",
    "this is clear evidence that the e@xmath1  l@xmath2 correlations and analysis reported elsewhere in the literature are strongly influenced by selection biases .    for our lgrb x - ray luminosity data ( at 11 hr rest frame )",
    ", we employ the same data selection from the optical sample , namely those x - ray luminosities with an optical afterglow that satisfy @xmath32 and @xmath38 from the @xcite sample .",
    "we tested both the biased x - ray luminosity data ( 55 lrgbs ) , and the bias corrected selection ( 21 lgrbs ) , for a e@xmath1 ",
    "l@xmath41 correlation .",
    "similar to the optical , we find the biased sample has a significant correlation @xmath42 .",
    "the same test applied to the bias reduced sample gives a statistically insignificant correlation , similar to that found in the optical sample .",
    "it is clear that a malmquist bias is the dominant effect in the observed e@xmath1 ",
    "l@xmath2 correlations in this study , and likely other works .      for sgrbs",
    ", we followed the same analysis procedure as above to identify a malmquist bias .",
    "unfortunately , although we identify a distance - dependent bias in sgrb x - ray luminosity , the data is too small ( 9 bursts with both confident redshifts and x - ray luminosities at 11hr ) to apply a robust selection criteria that would yield a statistically significant sample .",
    "hence , we do not apply any selection criteria to this data , but note that the e@xmath1  l@xmath2 correlation using this data is likely biased . with this proviso",
    ", we find a relatively significant @xmath43 correlation with @xmath44 .",
    "as shown above , the lgrb data selection ( bias free ) shows no significant correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 , hence a fit to this data is both unreliable and not meaningful ( see * ? ? ? * for the pitfalls of fitting to weakly correlated data ) .",
    "alternatively , we can apply a constrained synchrotron model fitted to the median of the lgrb @xmath0 and @xmath5 distributions to compare with the sgrb data .",
    "we describe the procedure and motivation below :    we assume that the microphysical parameter distributions of @xmath6 , @xmath19 and @xmath25 vary between sgrbs and lgrbs .",
    "we use separate synchrotron models , assuming the same power law index , @xmath45 , to the sgrb and lgrb data selections , constrained by the median of @xmath0 and @xmath5 distributions for the two grb classes .",
    "the result of assuming two different microphysical distributions is to introduce different scalings for @xmath5 .",
    "the ratio of the two scalings is related to differences in the median of the microphysical parameter distributions , and/or energy efficiency , between lgrbs and sgrbs .",
    "finally , the ratio between the optical and x - ray luminosity ratios provides insight into the relative difference in @xmath25 between lgrbs and sgrbs , as the x - ray luminosity is expected to be independent of @xmath25 and @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we fit a single unconstrained power law model , with the power index a free parameter , for a comparison with other studies .",
    "it is not used to place constraints on the microphysical parameter distributions , because of the large scatter of the @xmath0 and @xmath5 distributions .",
    "figure 3 plots @xmath0 and @xmath5 for the two scenarios above using the lgrb optical luminosity bias free selection ( see fig 1 ) combined with sgrb , and sgrb - ee data .",
    "we apply two synchrotron models constrained by the medians of @xmath0 and @xmath29 distributions , assuming @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 for lgrbs and sgrbs .",
    "there is @xmath47 evidence for different scaling of the two models with ratio of @xmath48 between lgrbs and sgrbs . for x - ray luminosity",
    ", the synchrotron model predicts that @xmath49 is independent of the microphysical parameters , so that the ratio @xmath50 should be unity .",
    "this is shown to be the case in the bottom figure for x - ray luminosity .",
    "if we reasonably assume that the scaling is a result of the difference in microphysical parameters between lgrbs and sgrbs , then the scaling ratio implies that the combined microphysical parameter values are relatively larger for sgrbs compared to lgrbs .",
    "for comparison with previous studies , we apply an unconstrained power law model fit to the combined lgrb and sgrb data , and find @xmath51 erg s@xmath52 and @xmath53 erg s@xmath52 for the optical and x - ray luminosities respectively .",
    "the shallower fits to the combined data , also identified by @xcite , can be partially explained by the scatter in the two - parameter relation of gamma - ray energy release and x - ray luminosity , which may be attributed to the presence of hidden variables like @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "in summary , we identify a strong malmquist bias in grb optical and x - ray afterglow luminosity data .",

    "l@xmath2 correlation for long grbs is not statistically significant , but combining sgrb , sgrb - ee and lgrb data , the correlation is significant .",
    "it is possible that the correlation between lgrb optical luminosity and redshift is intrinsic ( there is a physical correlation between afterglow luminosity and redshift ) .",
    "we do not consider this in our analysis , because it would require including ad - hoc additions to the standard synchrotron model that can not be currently physically justified .    applying a synchrotron model ( assuming @xmath45 ) constrained by the median of the e@xmath1 ",
    "l@xmath2 distributions for lgrbs and sgrbs separately , we find a factor of 5 difference in scaling between optical and x - ray luminosities .",
    "we test several possible scenarios to explain this result .",
    "firstly , if the prompt energy efficiency for sgrbs was systematically smaller , relative to lgrbs , then the median sgrb @xmath0 would be smaller .",
    "but we highlight that the scaling between sgrbs and lgrbs for the x - ray data is unity ( fig 3 ) , so this explanation is not consistent with the data .",
    "secondly , if sgrbs had a median beaming angle significantly greater than lgrbs , this would also shift the median sgrb @xmath0 to a smaller value compared to the lgrb @xmath0 .",
    "but , again this should be apparent in the x - ray @xmath64 correlation .",
    "hence we attribute the difference in scaling between the optical and x - ray correlation as a result of systematic differences in the microphysical parameter distributions of @xmath6 and @xmath25 . furthermore , for @xmath25 to be similar to ( or systematically smaller ) for sgrbs compared to lgrbs , requires @xmath6 to be systematically higher relative to lgrbs .",
