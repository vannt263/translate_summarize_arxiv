    "consider the open moduli space @xmath0 of compact riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 with @xmath2 marked points .",
    "there is a construction , due to costelllo @xcite and known as a _ topological conformal field theory _",
    "( or tcft for short ) , which associates to every calabi - yau elliptic space , a closed differential form @xmath3 on this moduli space .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of a calabi - yau elliptic space is the space @xmath4 of complex - valued differential forms on a compact riemannian manifold .",
    "more interesting examples include differential forms with values in the endomorphism bundle of a vector bundle over a compact riemannian manifold , equipped with a metric and a flat connection .",
    "the differential form @xmath3 on this moduli space contains information of a physical character .",
    "integrating this form over the moduli space @xmath0 corresponds to integrating over all possible complex structures on a surface , and physically represents path integrals in which world - lines are replaced by world - sheets traced out by interacting open strings .",
    "examples of physical theories which can be accommodated in this context include chern - simons theory and yang - mills theory , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to integrate this form over the moduli space , since it is not a compactly supported form .",
    "this differential form diverges as we approach the boundary of the moduli space @xmath0 , due to the singular nature of the heat kernel at time @xmath5 from which this form is constructed .",
    "such divergences commonly go under the heading of ` ultra - violet divergences ' .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explain that this problem is due to the infinite - dimensional nature of the calabi - yau elliptic space . specifically , we consider the finite - dimensional analogue of this construction and show that in this case , there is a natural compactification of the moduli space @xmath0 to which the differential form @xmath3 extends .",
    "this is due to the fact that the terms which diverge in the infinite - dimensional case , are in fact finite in the finite - dimensional case .    notwithstanding the fact that the problematic terms are finite in the finite - dimensional case , the problem of extending this form to a compactification of the moduli space is a nontrivial problem .",
    "the compactification that we will use is a quotient of the well - known deligne - mumford compactification @xmath6 .",
    "this quotient was considered by looijenga in @xcite as a minor generalisation of the compactification used by kontsevich @xcite in his proof of witten s conjectures .",
    "the issue is the complicated topological structure of the moduli space @xmath0 and the highly stratified nature of its compactification @xmath6 . if we choose a compactification ( such as the one - point compactification ) in which the boundary is not large enough , or does not have the right combinatorial structure , extending the form will not be possible .",
    "we will see that the combinatorics of the extension problem are solved by the combinatorial properties of an _ open topological field theory _ , as famously axiomatised by atiyah - segal et al .",
    "specifically , the terms which lie at the boundary of the moduli space are the terms of the open topological field theory associated to the calabi - yau elliptic space .",
    "it is well - known that one of the first consequences of the axioms of an open topological field theory is that the vector space in question must be finite - dimensional .",
    "hence , if our calabi - yau elliptic space is infinite - dimensional , the terms which lie at the boundary of the moduli space , fail to exist ; or to be more precise , these terms are _",
    "infinite_. this accounts for why our form @xmath3 diverges as we approach the boundary of moduli space .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec_forms ]",
    "we recall standard material about the orbi - cell decomposition of the moduli space of curves due to harer @xcite , mumford , penner @xcite and thurston and the notion of orbi - cellular forms on the moduli space . in section [ sec_operad ]",
    "we recall the framework of modular operads due to getzler and kapranov @xcite , and the notion of an open topological field theory as described in this context by @xcite , following the classic axioms of atiyah - segal et al . in section [ sec_construction ] , we describe costello s construction of a closed form on @xmath0 in the finite - dimensional context and in section [ sec_extend ] we show that this construction extends to the aforementioned compactification of the moduli space . in section [ sec_dual ] , we show that if our finite - dimensional calabi - yau elliptic space ( which is nothing more than a differential graded frobenius algebra in this case ) is _ contractible _ , this construction coincides with the construction introduced by kontsevich in @xcite , as formulated precisely by chuang and lazarev in @xcite .",

    "the author would also like to thank andrey lazarev for a number of helpful discussions .",
    "let us briefly describe costello s construction , which produces a closed form on the moduli space of curves .",
    "we start with the de rham algebra @xmath7 of complex - valued differential forms on a compact riemannian manifold @xmath8 .",
    "more generally , we can start with any calabi - yau elliptic space , cf .",
    "@xcite ; but this example will be sufficient to demonstrate the general features of the construction .",
    "we consider the operator @xmath9 , constructed from the laplacian @xmath10 $ ] , which describes how the states in @xmath11 evolve according to the heat equation .",
    "the results of @xcite imply that this operator is represented by a kernel @xmath12 called the _",

    "given a compact decorated riemann surface @xmath16 with negative euler characteristic and at least one marked point , the results of jenkins @xcite or strebel @xcite allow us to uniquely associate to this riemann surface a graph @xmath17 , known as a _ ribbon graph _",

    "the problem arises as the length @xmath14 of a loop tends towards zero .",
    "as we shrink the length of a loop of this graph , which lies embedded in the surface @xmath16 , this surface will develop a nodal singularity .",
    "such nodal surfaces are precisely the types of surfaces lying at the boundary of the deligne - mumford compactification @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , as the length @xmath14 of this loop approaches zero , the heat kernel @xmath20 attached to this loop via the closed form @xmath19 develops a divergence .",
    "this causes the associated form @xmath3 to also develop a divergence as we approach the boundary of the moduli space .",
    "contracting an edge which is not a loop poses no problems however , essentially because the diagonal in @xmath21 on which the heat kernel blows up is a set of measure zero in @xmath21 .",
    "consider the decorated moduli space @xmath22 of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 with @xmath23 labeled marked points .",
    "the numbers in @xmath24 are known as the _ perimeters _ of the marked points .",

    "any open topological field theory assigns a 3-valent tensor to the unique surface @xmath136 of genus 0 with 3 labelled intervals embedded into its single boundary component .",
    "this 3-valent tensor is just the structure map of the frobenius algebra of corollary [ cor_otft ] .",
    "since it is clear that any surface with nonempty boundary could be constructed from copies of @xmath136 by gluing the intervals along the boundary together , that is to say that @xmath136 generates @xmath123 , any open topological field theory is completely determined by this 3-valent tensor .",
    "corollary [ cor_otft ] simply says that given any differential graded frobenius algebra , there is an open topological field theory which assigns to the surface @xmath136 the structure map of this frobenius algebra .",
    "in this section we formulate the construction of costello @xcite producing classes on the moduli space in the context of a _ finite - dimensional _ differential graded frobenius algebra .",
    "let @xmath11 be a finite - dimensional differential graded frobenius algebra ; that is a differential @xmath137-graded algebra with a symmetric even invariant inner product @xmath106 : @xmath138 furthermore , we assume that @xmath11 comes equipped with an _ _ abstract hodge decomposition _ _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which consists of a pair of operators @xmath139 satisfying : @xmath140 the above data is equivalent to a decomposition @xmath141 of @xmath11 into an acyclic subspace @xmath142 and a subspace @xmath143 .",
    "such hodge decompositions always exist , cf . @xcite .",
    "later , we will explain how the construction is independent of this data .",
    "from these operators we can form a `` laplacian '' @xmath144 .",
    "now we want to consider a deformation of the inverse inner product .",
    "we define a one - parameter family of inner products @xmath145 depending on a parameter @xmath146 , such that at @xmath5 we recover our original inner product .",
    "this family is constructed to satisfy the differential equation @xmath147=-(\\delta\\otimes\\operatorname{id})[k_t]\\ ] ] this differential equation is easily solved by the explicit formula @xmath148.\\ ] ] since @xmath149 is idempotent , we have the following formula for @xmath150 : @xmath151    we can consider our deformed inner product @xmath20 as an element in @xmath152 .",
    "now we will construct an inner product valued differential form @xmath153 by setting @xmath154\\cdot dt.\\ ] ] this form is a cycle with respect to the combination of the de rham differential on @xmath58 and the differential in the frobenius algebra @xmath11 .",
    "this follows from the `` heat equation '' and the fact that @xmath149 commutes with @xmath155 .",
    "let us recall how the construction works .",
    "consider the decorated moduli space @xmath156/\\mathbb{s}_n$ ] .",
    "we will define a closed orbi - cellular form on each cell of @xmath156/\\mathbb{s}_n$ ] and show that they glue together to yield a closed form on the moduli space .",
    "suppose we take an open cell indexed by a ribbon graph @xmath17 .",

    "so our desired map is @xmath162 where @xmath26 denotes the vertices of @xmath17 .     to the vertices of the ribbon graph",

    "the form @xmath56 is well - defined and independent of the choices implicit in its construction .",
    "furthermore , it is @xmath31-invariant .    it remains to show that these forms @xmath56 glue together to yield a form on the decorated moduli space .",

    "the pull - back of the differential form @xmath153 to @xmath5 is just the tensor @xmath169 .",
    "consequently , the differential form @xmath168 $ ] is obtained by replacing the differential form @xmath19 on the shrinking edge @xmath32 ( not loop ) with the inverse inner product and applying the map @xmath170 .",
    "one can check that joining the tensors @xmath171 and @xmath172 with the inverse inner product @xmath110 yields the tensor @xmath173 , which is precisely the map which is placed at the newly formed vertex in @xmath33 which results from collapsing the edge @xmath32 , hence these forms glue to a global form on the moduli space .",
    "in this section we show that the construction outlined in the previous section extends to the compactification @xmath174}}$ ] of moduli space defined in section [ sec_forms ] . as was mentioned in remark [ rem_contractible ] , this compactification is in fact contractible , hence costello s construction produces something trivial in the case of a finite - dimensional algebra ( except of course for the class in @xmath175/\\mathbb{s}_n)\\cong{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}$ ] , which we will see corresponds to the amplitude of the associated open topological field theory ) .",
    "this extension is not possible in the infinite - dimensional case due to the presence of ultra - violet divergences in the integrands , hence the classes obtained in this case may be nontrivial .",
    "nonetheless , we show that if our finite - dimensional differential graded frobenius algebra is _ contractible _ , this form is the pull - back of a cocycle on a noncontractible space .",
    "hence , if our finite - dimensional algebra is contractible , we may hope to be able to use it to produce nontrivial classes .",

    "to each open orbi - cell indexed by a stable ribbon graph @xmath17 , we must assign a differential form @xmath56 .",

    "this open topological field theory assigns to this topological surface the desired map @xmath177 .",

    "it follows from the axioms of an open topological field theory , as expressed in section [ sec_operad ] through the language of modular operads , that the form @xmath56 is @xmath31-invariant and does not depend upon the various choices implicit in its construction .",

    "hence we contract the corresponding tensors in the map @xmath182 using @xmath110 , and apply the result to the form @xmath183 to arrive at the value for the pullback @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "glue to yield a form on the compactification @xmath46 . ]",
    "since an open topological field theory is an algebra over the modular operad @xmath123 , it follows from these axioms that the tensor that we get from @xmath182 by contracting using @xmath110 , is the same as the tensor that is obtained from the collection of open topological field theories when we replace the edge @xmath32 by a thin strip and glue the ends of this strip to the corresponding topological surface(s ) . by definition , this is exactly the tensor that is assigned by to @xmath33 .",
    "hence we see that the form @xmath168 $ ] coincides with the form @xmath167 that is assigned to the orbi - cell @xmath33 , and thus the forms @xmath56 glue to yield an orbi - cellular form @xmath184 on @xmath46 .    from this description",
    "we may understand why the problem of extending a topological conformal field theory to the boundary of the moduli space arises when the dimension of the algebra @xmath11 is _ infinite_. as we head towards the boundary of the moduli space , the complex structure on our riemann surface degenerates . at the boundary of the moduli space we are left with nodal surfaces ,",
    "some of whose irreducible components retain only their topological structure . to those components with complex structure",
    ", we may assign a conformal field theory using the heat kernel etc .",
    ", as described by costello in @xcite , but to those components with only topological structure , we may assign only a topological field theory .",
    "it is well - known that one of the immediate consequences of the axioms of a topological field theory is that the underlying space must be finite - dimensional .",
    "more accurately , when the space is infinite - dimensional , the terms of our topological field theory are infinite .",
    "consider , for example , the number assigned by an open topological field theory to the annulus .",
    "this number is just the trace of the identity operator , i.e. the dimension of the space .",
    "hence , when the dimension of the space is infinite , this number will be infinite , and in general the terms lying at the boundary of the moduli space contributed by the open topological field theory will be divergent . this problem does not arise with the conformal field theory because the operator @xmath150 is of trace class for @xmath185 , its trace being given by integrating the heat kernel over the diagonal .",
    "it is only at @xmath5 , when the conformal structure on the riemann surface degenerates , that its trace becomes infinite .",
    "now we consider the full compactifications @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the decorated moduli space @xmath25/\\mathbb{s}_n$ ] , rather than the partial compactification @xmath46 .",

    "that is to say that it contracts all the orbi - cells with at least one white edge .",
    "the differential form @xmath184 on @xmath46 that we have just constructed extends to the compactification @xmath47 .",
    "this follows from equation , from which we see that @xmath187=(\\pi\\otimes\\operatorname{id})\\left[{\\ensuremath{\\langle -,-",
    "\\rangle}}^{-1}\\right]\\in a^{\\otimes 2}.\\ ] ] to describe the extension of the form @xmath184 to @xmath47 , it suffices to specify the forms @xmath56 which are assigned to the orbi - cells @xmath17 in @xmath47 with at least one white edge . on the black edges of @xmath17",
    "is placed the form @xmath153 , as before , and on the white edges of @xmath17 is placed the tensor , which is a cycle with respect to @xmath155 . applying the map @xmath188 as before yields a closed form @xmath189 on the orbi - cell @xmath17 .",
    "it follows from equation that these forms satisfy the necessary gluing property .",
    "now suppose that our differential graded frobenius algebra is _",
    "contractible_. then we claim that the closed differential form @xmath184 on @xmath47 is the pull - back of a cocycle on the one point compactification @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath11 is contractible , we have @xmath190 and the differential form @xmath184 vanishes as we approach the point at infinity .",
    "now , we would like to say that this implies that @xmath184 extends to a form on @xmath48 , but clearly the map which shrinks the boundaries of cells to a point is somewhat awkward to deal with in the context of smooth structure , so we will work with the orbi - cellular cochains instead . since @xmath191",
    ", it clearly follows that there is an orbi - cellular cochain in @xmath192 ( which must be unique and a cocycle ) whose pullback to @xmath47 via the map yields the orbi - cellular cocycle associated to the form @xmath184 on @xmath47 by .",
    "in this section we show the equivalence of costello s construction , in the finite - dimensional case , to the `` dual construction '' of kontsevich @xcite .",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the second line follows from equation .",
    "the third and fourth lines follow from the identities for the hodge decomposition .    from this",
    "we can show costello s construction agrees with kontsevich s as follows .",
    "given a differential graded frobenius algebra @xmath11 with a hodge decomposition , consider the corresponding closed orbi - cellular form @xmath184 on @xmath47 defined in section [ sec_extend ] . by",
    ", this orbi - cellular form gives rise to an orbi - cellular cocycle on @xmath47 by integrating @xmath184 over the orbi - cells of @xmath47 .",
    "if the differential graded frobenius algebra is _ contractible _ , it was shown at the end of the previous section that this cocycle lifts via the map to a cocycle on @xmath48 .",
    "this orbi - cellular cocycle associates to every stable ribbon graph @xmath194 , the following number .",

    "hence , the number which is assigned to the graph @xmath17 is computed by attaching to each edge of @xmath17 the tensor @xmath201 $ ] and contracting these tensors using the map @xmath170 , which applies to each vertex of the stable ribbon graph @xmath17 , the open topological field theory assigned to that vertex by the topological surface which decorates it .",
    "this number is exactly that which is assigned to the stable ribbon graph @xmath17 by the dual construction of kontsevich , as formulated by chuang - lazarev in @xcite .",
