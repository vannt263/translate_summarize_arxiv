    "in the imaginary time formalism of finite temperature field theory , temporal correlators are related to several dynamical properties through a prescription of analytical continuation .",
    "especially the imaginary time correlator can be described by the same spectral function as that of retarded and advanced green functions .",
    "therefore the spectral functions extracted from the imaginary time correlators , which are able to be calculated in lattice qcd , enable us to investigate important physics at finite temperature , e.g. dilepton rates @xcite , light mesons @xcite , heavy quarkonia @xcite , glueballs @xcite , transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "one of the most important quantities at finite temperature qcd is the spectral function of heavy quarkonium , which plays the key role for understanding the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in heavy ion collision experiments e.g. the rhic experiment at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "recent studies on the spectral function of charmonium above @xmath3 suggest that hadronic excitations corresponding to @xmath4 may survive in the deconfinement phase till relatively high temperature @xcite .",
    "such results of strongly interacting qgp may affect the scenario of @xmath4 suppression @xcite . therefore the determination of the accurate dissociation temperature of @xmath4 is required for many phenomenological studies .    as somewhat different from the `` direct '' @xmath4 suppression ,",
    "recently an `` indirect '' @xmath4 suppression was proposed @xcite .",
    "the total yield of @xmath4 is not only from the direct production , about 40% of the @xmath4 s that come from the higher states @xmath5 and @xmath1 @xcite . if the higher states dissociate at lower temperatures , a part of the @xmath4 suppression may be observed in experiments at a lower temperature than that of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the study of @xmath5 and @xmath1 states and their dissociation temperatures is a very interesting subject for the physics of qgp .",
    "several groups have already investigated the @xmath1 states , and their results indicate that the lowest peak of the spectral function , corresponding to the @xmath1 state , may dissociate just after the transition temperature @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there is no lattice qcd study on the @xmath5 states above @xmath3 , because it is difficult to extract information of non - lowest states such as @xmath5 from the correlator on the lattice at finite temperature .    in such studies of temporal correlators at finite temperature",
    ", one has to take account of a characteristic contribution caused by the finite temporal extent .",
    "usually a meson correlator is interpreted by a diagram with quark and anti - quark propagators like it is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr](a ) .    however in the case of a system with a finite temporal extent , a wraparound ( scattering ) contribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr](b ) , has to be included as well .",
    "it is similar to the situation at zero temperature e.g. the study of two pion correlators @xcite , and pentaquark correlator @xcite . because these correlators include multi - hadron states as intermediate states , and each state is also allowed as a color singlet state , which can have a finite energy state in the confined phase . at zero temperature the calculation should be performed , in principle , with infinite temporal extent , therefore , the wraparound effect is not physical .",
    "the contribution is usually removed using e.g. dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite or appropriate analyses @xcite .    in finite temperature calculations using the imaginary time formalism , the temporal extent is determined by ( the inverse of ) the temperature , and the quark fields have to have anti - periodic boundary conditions . in the confinement phase , an expectation value of the diagram in fig.[fig : corr](b ) vanishes because it is related to a single quark propagation , which is exponentially suppressed with its infinite energy due to the confinement . on the other hand , in the deconfinement phase",
    ", the contribution may yield a finite expectation value .",
    "this is similar to the discussion of the polyakov loop expectation value .",
    "for example in the free quark system , when one adopt a meson - like operator with degenerate quark masses and zero spatial momentum , the correlator of the diagram in fig.[fig : corr](a ) behaves like @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the quark mass ( or the energy of a single quark state ) .",
    "( here we note that equations are written with dimension - less variables throughout this paper , if there is no comment on the units . ) on the other hand , the diagram in fig.[fig : corr](b ) behaves like @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the inverse of the temperature .",
    "the latter diagram provides a constant contribution to the correlator , and the contribution may dominate in the large imaginary time region as a zero energy mode . due to the contribution , correlators of such meson - like operators , e.g. charmonia ,",
    "may be drastically changed just after the deconfinement transition .",
    "the latter type diagram , in general , yields t - dependent contributions which depends on a difference between single quark energies for each quark propagator . even in non - degenerate quark masses or non - zero spatial momentum cases ,",
    "the diagram can yield the constant contribution when the energies are identical .",
    "however we do not discuss the case in this paper .",
    "the finite momentum case has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite at high temperature limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : freetheory ] we discuss the correlators of meson - like operators and its spectral functions in a system of free quarks with finite temporal extent .",
    "some numerical results are also presented . in this section",
    "we also discuss the physical interpretation of the constant contribution and some analysis methods to avoid this contribution . in sect .",
    "[ sec : quench_qcd ] we show numerical simulations in quenched qcd on anisotropic lattices , and demonstrate effects of the constant contribution in the interacting case and the analyses to avoid the contribution . as a result of these analyses",
    "we show that the @xmath1 state yields a small change except for the constant mode in its spectral function after the deconfinement transition like the @xmath4 state at least up to @xmath10 .",
    "at last we discuss results on the constant contribution .",
    "in order to investigate the constant contribution as mentioned in the introduction , we first consider the free quark case of qcd , in which the constant contribution can be easily calculated . here",
    "we define the meson - like correlators with quark bilinear operators , @xmath11 , in the free quark case this gives for the correlator , @xmath12 where @xmath13 are appropriate @xmath14 matrices , i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for pseudoscalar(ps ) , vector(v ) , scalar(s ) , and axialvector(av ) channels respectively . in this section and",
    "later we always adopt the anti - periodic boundary condition for quark fields in temporal direction to suppose a finite temperature case , and periodic boundary conditions in spatial directions . in this paper",
    "we calculate correlators for degenerate quark masses , constructed from bilinear operators , with vanishing spatial momentum as the simplest case , which is aiming at studies of charmonium at finite temperature discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : quench_qcd ] .",
    "the spectral function of the correlator is defined by @xmath19 and has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the high temperature limit .    in the spectral representation ,",
    "the constant contribution provides a term proportional to @xmath0 , which corresponds to a constant mode in the meson - like correlators .",
    "this term is an odd function in frequency @xmath20 , which is one of the basic properties of bosonic spectral function . from the results in @xcite one can find several characteristic properties of the constant contribution .",
    "first there is no constant mode in the ps channel , however the other correlators have the constant mode , which comes from the scattering contribution .",
    "the correlator in the s channel has also no constant mode at vanishing quark mass , where the chiral symmetry is restored . secondly , in the v channel ( and the av channel in the chiral limit )",
    ", there is no constant contribution coming from the zero relative momentum process . on the other hand",
    ", there is one in the av and s channels ( and it disappears in chiral limit ) and @xmath21 ( if quark mass is finite ) respectively . ] .",
    "these properties are very important especially in a finite volume calculation .",
    "when the minimum nonzero momentum due to the finite volume is large , the contribution of the zero relative momentum processes dominates in the correlators .",
    "furthermore , a two quark state with zero relative momentum is forbidden in the p - wave state . therefore the relative contribution of the constant mode increases exponentially as the spatial volume decreases in the p - wave state at finite quark mass . as a result",
    ", we can expect a very different behavior of correlators between s - wave and p - wave states in the case of finite quark mass and finite ( but relatively small ) volume .",
    "thirdly , correlators for each channel coincide at the midpoint @xmath22 as mentioned in ref .",
    "these characteristic properties will be confirmed also by the numerical results presented in the next section ( [ sec : free_lattice ] ) .",
    "it is important to consider physical interpretations of this contribution .",
    "the term @xmath0 remains in the continuum form and infinite volume results @xcite , while it disappears at zero temperature , i.e. infinite temporal extent .",
    "therefore the contribution is caused by a kind of physical thermal effect .",
    "the origin of the effect could be considered as a scattering with the thermal bath ( landau dumping ) which is related to some transport coefficients . from the kubo formula , for example , a derivative of the spectral function in the v channel , @xmath23 which is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : spf ] ) using @xmath24 , is related to the electrical conductivity @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26    let us also note on the dilepton rate .",
    "the dilepton rate is extracted from the spectral functions in the vector channel of spatial ( @xmath27 with @xmath24 ) and temporal ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) components , @xmath30 @xmath31 is the charge susceptibility and it has only the @xmath0 term which is equivalent to that of @xmath27 with the opposite sign . therefore the constant contribution in the dilepton rate cancels at least for the free quark case .      in this subsection we present numerical calculations of the meson - like correlators for free quarks on lattices .",
    "the calculations are performed on isotropic @xmath32 lattices , and the volume dependence is discussed using results for @xmath33 lattice .",
    "the free quark is described by the wilson quark action with a bare quark mass of @xmath34 .",

    "the free quark propagator satisfies the dispersion relation , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the energy of a quark with momentum @xmath40 . using eq .",

    "v channels , the zero relative momentum processes have no constant contribution and their effective masses approach the expected values . in the s and av channels , on the other hand , their effective masses approach the zero energy level rather than the energy of two quark states .",
    "next i present the results for the different volume .",
    "figure [ fig : free1b ] and [ fig : free2b ] are results of the meson - like correlators and their effective masses on a @xmath42 lattice with the same quark mass , @xmath34 , respectively . in the latter section ( [ sec : quench_qcd ] ) , we present simulations in quenched qcd at finite temperature , where the finite temperature lattices have the similar aspect ratio , @xmath43 , and the lowest state energy in lattice units to this free quark calculation with @xmath44 .",
    "although we find the large volume dependence between @xmath41 and @xmath44 , almost no volume dependence is seen for @xmath45 . at a sufficiently large aspect ratio , we find no clear constant contribution , but the finite constant contribution exists when the quark mass is finite .",
    "since the lattice qcd is formulated in euclidean space - time , we can isolate the lowest state contribution from correlators in the large euclidean time region , while studies of non - lowest states are not so easy .",
    "when one want to know the information about nonzero energy states , the constant mode makes it difficult .",

    "if the width of the peak structure in the spectral function at @xmath47 is sufficiently small , e.g. @xmath48 , the contribution yields only a constant mode in the correlators @xcite . therefore , in order to investigate the nonzero energy states in the correlators , it is useful to remove the constant mode from the correlators in an appropriate analysis . in this subsection",

    "below @xmath3 , in principle , the constant contribution vanishes due to the infinite energy of a single quark state in the confinement phase .",
    "however the contribution on each configuration may have a small value near @xmath3 even in confinement phase , like the polyakov loop just below @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench5 ] . in this case",
    "the effect of the constant contribution appears in the correlators .",
    "since the polyakov loop sector frequently changes below @xmath3 , the effects appear as the large fluctuation in the correlators .    when the averaged correlator defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defavecorr ] ) is calculated , one can expect that most of the constant contributions are canceled like in the free quark case ( sect .",
    "[ sec : free_ploop ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : quench7 ] shows the results of @xmath78 at each temperature .",
    "we find almost the same behavior as in fig .  [",
    "fig : quench4 ] .",
    "the results also suggest that the drastic changes in the p - wave states just above @xmath3 are coming from the constant contribution only",
    ".      finally we present results of meson correlators with spatially extended operators .",
    "the spatially extended operators are constructed with a smearing function which yields a spatial distribution of quark ( and anti - quark ) source(s ) .",
    "the distribution also changes the momentum distribution of the quark propagation .",
    "for example , a point source function yields any ( lattice ) momenta with equal distribution , while a wall source function yields only quark propagation with zero momentum . in the case of our source",
    "the ( smearing ) function provides quark propagation with any momenta but quark propagators with small momentum are enhanced .",
    "therefore the correlators with spatially extended operators defined , as in sect .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , yield ( relatively ) large overlap with the lower energy states .",
    "figure [ fig : quench8 ] is the result for the usual effective masses with the spatially extended operators .",
    "other conditions are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench2 ] . below @xmath3 ,",
    "in contrast to the case of local operators the effective masses reach a plateau due to the larger overlap with the lowest state . above @xmath3",
    "the effective masses of the p - wave states change more than in the case of local operators . because the constant contribution is enhanced by the smearing function more than the other contributions in the case .",
    "the effect of the constant contribution is also present in the v channel . at least in the free quark case , as we discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : freecorr ] , the constant contribution to the v channel is smaller than that to the p - wave states for finite quark masses and small volumes .",
    "in fact , even in quenched qcd , it is difficult to see the effect in the v channel in local operators .",
    "however we find small but finite changes even in the v channel above @xmath3 while no changes are seen in the ps channel as we expected .",
    "we can say that the small changes in the v channel is caused by the constant contribution , because the analysis with the midpoint subtracted correlators shows almost no changes in the v channel above @xmath3 as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench9 ] . similar to the results with local operators ,",
    "the effective masses of the p - wave states also show small change at any temperatures .",
    "figure [ fig : quench10 ] is the same figure as fig .",
    "[ fig : quench7 ] , but with spatially extended operators .",
    "we find similar behavior for both cases of operators .",
    "let us discuss details on @xmath1 states using the results of the previous sections .",
    "in this study we find that the drastic changes of the ( usual ) correlators in the p - wave states are caused by the constant contribution , while the correlators without the constant mode yield small change till , at least , @xmath2 even in the p - wave states .",
    "the changes are of similar size as that of the s - wave states as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench11 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : quench12 ] .    in the case of the spatially extended operators ,",
    "the averaged effective mass @xmath78 for the av channel gradually reduces as the temperature increases .",
    "the change seems to be effected by the constant contributions with the @xmath62 center symmetry as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : free_ploop ] .",
    "in fact , we can not find any hints of such a change in @xmath57 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : quench12 ] .",
    "furthermore it is reasonable to find the effect only in case of the spatially extended operators , because the @xmath62 symmetric constant contribution is enhanced by the smearing function .",
    "although the constant mode coming from the scattering process is important to investigate some transport phenomena , it does not affect the spectral function in the @xmath122 region for the charmonium correlators with zero spatial momentum .",
    "therefore the dissolution of @xmath1 states just above @xmath3 as discussed in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite might be misleading . when there is the constant contribution , the hadronic state is no longer the lowest state .",
    "the situation provides some difficulties in the analysis to reconstruct the spectral function in the higher energy part @xmath122 even if the mem is applied @xcite .",
    "the difficulties may be understood by the fact that most studies of the charmonium spectral function can not reproduce the excited states correctly especially at finite temperature ( even below @xmath3 ) .",
    "furthermore , in general , correlators for the p - wave states are noisier than that for the s - wave states as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : quench1 ] .    in principle",
    "the mem analysis can extract the correct spectral function even if the constant contribution exists , however it is difficult to reproduce the non - lowest part of the spectral function correctly by the mem analysis at finite temperature with typical statistics . in order to investigate the properties of @xmath1 states above @xmath3",
    ", a careful analysis taking the constant contribution into account is necessary .",
    "a correct mem analysis of the correlator with and without the constant contribution should give the same results , up to the low energy region @xmath61 .",
    "such a comparison can be easily performed by the mem analysis with the alternative kernel of eq .",
    "( [ eq : subkernel ] ) for midpoint subtracted correlators . failure to do so signals unreliable mem results .",
    "we also find a polyakov loop sector dependence of the constant contribution in quenched qcd .",
    "to study transport coefficients from the behavior of spectral function at @xmath80 one has to pay attention to the polyakov loop sector especially in quenched qcd calculations . from a practical viewpoint , the dependence on the polyakov loop sector is useful to estimate the constant contribution as discussed in sect .  [",
    "sec : free_ploop ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : quench_ploop ] .",
    "the constant contribution may also explain some other results of previous studies of temporal correlators .",
    "first , in the study of the spectral function at finite temperature by the mem analysis , one sometimes find a kind of divergence of the spectral function near @xmath80 , it may be caused by the constant contribution .",
    "of course it may be a simple failure of the analysis , however the contribution near @xmath80 ought to exist except for the ps channel .",
    "secondly , in the s - wave states of charmonium , several groups have reported that the correlator for the ps channel shows almost no change above the deconfinement transition , while that of the v channel shows a small but significant change @xcite .",
    "this can also be seen from our calculation in sect .",
    "[ sec : quench_qcd ] .",
    "it can be explained by the constant contribution as we did in this paper .",
    "thirdly , when one considers a spatial boundary condition dependence of the charmonium spectrum at finite temperature as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the p - wave states ( in the free quark case ) have the lowest energy using a `` hybrid boundary '' , which is an anti - periodic boundary in one spatial direction and periodic in the other directions . on the other hand",
    ", the p - wave state has a larger energy with periodic boundaries in any spatial directions .",
    "however the ( usual ) effective mass of the p - wave state correlators for free quark calculations provides a smaller value in periodic boundary conditions than in the hybrid boundary case",
    ". this unexpected behavior of the effective mass is also explained by the scattering processes because of suppression of the scattering contribution by the anti - periodic boundary in a spatial direction .",
    "finally , the polyakov loop sector dependence of the chiral order parameter in quenched qcd @xcite may be also explained by the effect of ( @xmath62 variant ) wrapped contributions in the chiral condensate .",
    "as we discussed in the last section , the constant contribution affects the temporal correlators at finite temperature in various cases .",
    "therefore it is important to take this contribution into account for studies of temporal correlators in lattice qcd at finite temperature .",
