    "we all know from experience or from intuition that when we press together two large , well - polished , glass plates , they will stick together extremely well ; in fact we will have a tough job trying to separate them again because in effect , the two glass panes have become one .",
    "a somewhat similar process of `` gluing without glue '' is used in the microelectronics and optoelectronics industries to bond together _ semiconductor wafers _ ( gsele and tong , 1998 ) . when brought into contact , mirror - polished , flat",
    ", clean wafers made of almost any material are attracted _ via _ van der walls forces and adhere in a rigid and permanent way .",
    "this method of direct bonding allows for new and promising designs for insulators , sensors , actuators , nonlinear optics , light - emitting diodes , etc .",
    "solid polymers can also be brought into permanent and rigid contact to manufacture _",
    "polymer composites_. the main traditional technologies of polymer joining are : mechanical fastening ( bolts , rivets , fit joints ) and : adhesive bonding .",
    "another technology , `` fusion bonding '' , presents great advantages over the previous ones such as , avoidance of high stress concentrations , reduced surface treatment , less inhomogeneities at the interfaces , etc .",
    "a recent book by ageorges and ye ( 2002 ) presents a comprehensive description of fusion bonding , defined as `` the joining of two polymer parts by the fusion and consolidation of their interface '' ; in particular four classes of fusion bonding are listed : `` bulk heating ( co - consolidation , hot - melt adhesives , dual - resin bonding ) , frictional heating ( spin welding , vibration welding , ultrasonic welding ) , electromagnetic heating ( induction welding , microwave heating , dielectric heating , resistance welding ) , and two - stage techniques ( hot plate welding , hot gas welding , radiant welding ) . ''    for semiconductor wafer bonding , the most common and most economical combination is the silicon / silicon wafer bonding .",
    "( 1998 ) considered the theoretical implications of misorientation when two identical silicon wafers are rigidly bonded .",
    "specifically they considered , within the framework of anisotropic _ linear elasticity _ , the propagation of interface ( stoneley ) waves along the bisectrix of a twist angle of misorientation .",
    "this paper deals with the propagation of waves of similar nature but within the framework of small motions superimposed on large static deformations ( stress - induced anisotropy ) in _ nonlinear elasticity _ , which is required to describe the possible large elastic deformations of polymers ( elastomers ) .",
    "specifically , two half - spaces made of the same hyperelastic incompressible material are maintained in the same static state of pure homogeneous deformation and are then rigidly bonded along a common principal plane of deformation , but in such a way that the two principal axes defining this plane for one half - space do not coincide with the two counterpart principal axes for the other half - space .",
    "the study of a superimposed infinitesimal interface wave propagating along the bisectrix of the misalignement angle provides insights into the possible ultrasonic non - destructive evaluation of the bond and of the angle of twist , and into the influence of the pre - strain on the interface stability .",
    "indeed in general , an increasingly tensile load applied on the semi - infinite bodies leads to faster speeds for an interfacial wave whereas a compressive load slows the wave down , until eventually the buckling / bifurcation criterion is met at the critical load , where the speed is zero .",
    "such investigations of interface waves and interfacial stability for two bonded hyperelastic pre - strained half - spaces are quite rare in the finite elasticity literature .",
    "they were initiated by biot ( 1963 ) , followed by a handful of papers : chadwick & jarvis ( 1979@xmath0 ) , dunwoody & villaggio ( 1988 ) , dowaikh & ogden ( 1991 ) , chadwick ( 1995 ) , destrade ( to appear , @xmath1 ) .",
    "note however that in these articles , the two semi - infinite deformed bodies are always aligned so that all three principal axes of pre - deformation for the upper half - space coincide with those for the lower half - space .",
    "moreover , the interface wave propagates along one of the common principal axes , except for chadwick & jarvis ( 1979@xmath0 ) , who consider non - principal directions of propagation but for a specific simple form of strain energy function ( compressible neo - hookean materials ) .",
    "some papers have been devoted to the study of non - principal interface waves ( e.g. flavin , 1963 ; willson , 1973 , 1974 ; chadwick & jarvis , 1979@xmath2 ; connor & ogden , 1995 ; rogerson & sandiford , 1999 ; etc . ) but explicit secular equations for tri - axially pre - strained materials have been found only in the case of neo - hookean ( compressible or incompressible ) materials . this strain energy density is exceptional with respect to the propagation of inhomogeneous plane waves because for any direction of propagation in a principal plane ( with associated orthogonal attenuation ) , the in - plane strain components always decouple from the anti - plane strain components .",
    "section 2 presents the incremental equations of motion for non - principal interface waves in a tri - axially pre - strained material with a generic ( non neo - hookean ) strain energy function , formulated as a first - order differential system for the six - component displacement - traction vector .",
    "it also presents the `` effective boundary conditions '' , consequences of the continuity of the mechanical displacements and tractions across the interface .",
    "namely , these conditions are that at the boundary , either one displacement and two tractions are zero , or two displacements and one traction are zero .",
    "( 1998 ) noted this important result for bonded silicon / silicon wafers in linear anisotropic crystallography .",
    "it is further proved here that once the displacement - traction vector is normalized with respect to one of its non - zero components , then the normalized components are either real or pure imaginary ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "this author recently obtained , in a quick and simple manner , some equations which are fundamental to the resolution of general interface boundary value problems ( destrade , 2003 ; destrade , to appear , @xmath3 ) including rayleigh ( solid / vacuum interface ) , scholte ( solid / fluid interface ) , and stoneley ( solid / solid interface ) waves ; they are presented in subsection 3.1 .",
    "the next subsection brings together these fundamental equations and the effective boundary conditions for the title problem , with an explicit form of the secular equation that is , a polynomial of which the interface wave speed is a root .",
    "finally section 4 shows how numerical results can be obtained from the analysis , with the case of deformed semi - infinite bodies made of mooney - rivlin material , a model often used to describe the behaviour of incompressible rubber in large deformations .",
    "consider an infinite body made of two pre - strained hyperelastic semi - infinite bodies , rigidly bonded along a plane interface .",
    "take the origin @xmath4 of a rectangular cartesian coordinate system ( @xmath5 ) to lie in the boundary , so that the plane of separation between the half - spaces is @xmath6 .",
    "the upper half - space @xmath7 is made of an incompressible isotropic hyperelastic body , with mass density @xmath8 and strain energy function @xmath9 , which has been subjected to a finite static pure homogeneous deformation with principal stretches @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) say , along the principal axes @xmath15 say , such that @xmath16 is aligned with @xmath17 but @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) makes an angle @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the lower half - space @xmath23 is made of the _ same _ body , which has been subjected to the _ same _ pre - deformation that is , a pure homogeneous deformation with principal stretches @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 along the principal axes @xmath24 ( say ) where @xmath25 is aligned with @xmath17 , but such that now @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) makes an angle @xmath28 with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "figure 1 summarizes this set - up with the representation of two parallelepipeds , one above @xmath6 , one below , which were unit cubes before the static deformation took place .",
    "now a small - amplitude inhomogeneous plane wave is superimposed upon the primary large static deformation . the wave propagates with speed @xmath29 and wave number @xmath30 in the @xmath21 direction and",
    "vanishes away from the interface @xmath6 . in other words",
    ", the corresponding incremental mechanical displacement @xmath31 is of the form , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the rectangular cartesian coordinate system associated with the motion .    similarly , the incremental nominal tractions @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) acting on the planes @xmath36 const .",

    "the displacement - traction vector is continuous , @xmath47 lengthy , but straightforward to establish , expressions for these quantities lead to the _ effective boundary conditions _ at the interface . in effect , and as displayed by mozhaev _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) in the linear anisotropic elasticity case , either one displacement component and two tractions are zero at the interface , or _",
    "vice - versa_. more specifically , and these details were not noted by mozhaev _",
    "( 1998 ) , @xmath48 must be of one of the two following forms",
    ". either @xmath49^\\text{t},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are real , or @xmath52^\\text{t},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are real .",
    "the appendix presents the derivation of these expressions .",
    "following mozhaev _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) , the interface acoustic wave satisfying ( resp . )",
    "is called iaw1 ( resp .",
    "here a quick derivation is made of some equations ( destrade , 2003 ) which are fundamental to the resolution of interface boundary problems involving waves or static deformations which are localized near , or equivalently vanish away from , the plane interface of a semi - infinite body .",
    "the equations are valid for unconstrained or constrained , pre - deformed nonlinearly elastic or anisotropic linearly elastic , materials .",
    "they do not rely on the stroh ( 1958 ) formalism .",
    "all that is required for their derivation are the few manipulations , available in the literature , leading to the equations of motion and boundary conditions in the form , @xmath55 , @xmath55 , that is @xmath56    in general here , @xmath43 is a square matrix of even dimensions , @xmath57 say . now",
    "a simple induction process ( currie , 1979 ; ting , 2003 ) shows that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is any positive or negative integer , is of the following form ( see for @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 consequently , pre - multiplication of @xmath58 by @xmath62 , defined as @xmath63 leads to a symmetric matrix , @xmath64    now take the scalar product of @xmath65 by @xmath66 and add the complex conjugate quantity to obtain @xmath67 .",
    "direct integration between zero and infinity yields , using @xmath55 , the _ fundamental equations _ sought , @xmath68 the cayley - hamilton theorem states that @xmath43 satisfies its own characteristic polynomial of degree @xmath69 .",
    "hence there are only @xmath70 powers of @xmath43 which are linearly independent and so , eqs .",
    "generate at most @xmath70 linearly independent equations .",
    "for instance in our case @xmath43 is a @xmath71 matrix , leading to only 5 linearly independent equations .",
    "these are nevertheless enough to deduce the secular equation explicitly , as is now seen .",
    "the fundamental equations now prove useful in the resolution of the paper s problem .",
    "the structure of @xmath72 depends on the parity of @xmath59 .",
    "for instance , @xmath73 where @xmath74 ; thus for example , @xmath75 .",
    "the forms and for @xmath48 lead to two trivial identities when are written at @xmath76 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath77 and so , the fundamental equations , written for iaw1 that is , @xmath48 given by , and for @xmath78 , yield the following system , @xmath79 when the fundamental equations are written for iaw2 that is , @xmath48 given by , and for @xmath78 , they yield the system , @xmath80 these equations are of the type @xmath81 where here @xmath82 is the @xmath83 matrix on the left hand - side of for iaw1 and of for iaw2 , @xmath84 is the vector on the right hand - side , and @xmath85^\\text{t}$ ] , @xmath86^\\text{t}$ ] , for iaw1 and for iaw2 , respectively . by cramer",
    "s rule , the unique solution is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the determinant of the matrix obtained from @xmath82 by replacing the @xmath30-th vector column with @xmath84 .",
    "however two components of @xmath90 are related one to another .",
    "specifically , @xmath91 , which is the _ explicit secular equation for interface waves propagating along the bissectrix of the misorientation angle for two identical , rigidly bonded , pre - deformed , hyperelastic half - spaces _ ,",
    "the classical mooney - rivlin model has been used extensively to model the behaviour of incompressible rubberlike materials in large deformations .",
    "its strain energy function @xmath9 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constant material parameters .",
    "in that case , the @xmath96 and @xmath97 defined in reduce to ( @xmath98 ) , @xmath99    now the peculiarities of interface acoustic waves in deformed hyperelastic materials are highlighted .",
    "in particular , and in contrast with the corresponding situation in linear anisotropic elasticity , it is seen that there exist certain ranges of misorientation and certain ranges of pre - stretch ratios for the existence of an iaw .",
    "also , interface instability may arise at certain compressive critical ratios .",
    "first , in order to make the connection with results obtained by rogerson & sandiford ( 1999 ) about non - principal surface waves , the material constants @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and the stretch ratios @xmath100 are fixed at the following values , @xmath101    the secular equation is a polynomial of degree 10 in @xmath102 for iaw1 , of degree 6 for iaw2 . out of the 16 possible roots ,",
    "only one leads to an interface wave of the stoneley type satisfying the known conditions that its speed is bounded above by the speed of the slowest homogeneous bulk wave and below by the speed of the rayleigh surface wave associated with either half - space ( barnett _ et al . _ , 1985 ) .",
    "moreover this wave , of the iaw1 type , satisfies these requirements only within a limited range of misorientation angle , approximatively @xmath103 .",
    "this situation is in sharp contrast with the case of silicon / silicon wafers in linear anisotropic elasticity ( mozhaev _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) where the iaw1 was found to exist for all @xmath20 .",
    "figure 2 depicts the variations of the relevant root to the secular equation , scaled as @xmath104 , with @xmath20 ( thick curve ) .",
    "the speeds of two homogeneous shear waves ( roots of @xmath105 ) are represented by the two thin curves above , and the speed of the rayleigh wave , by the thin curve below .",
    "next , the half - spaces are assumed to have been pre - deformed in such a way that they were not allowed to expand in the @xmath22-direction ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "for this example , the different parameters take the following numerical and algebraic values , @xmath107    figure 3 shows the variations of the speeds as functions of @xmath108 in compression ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the two upper dashed curves represent the speeds of homogeneous shear waves ; the intermediate thick curve , the speed of the stoneley wave ( type : iaw1 ) ; the bottom thin curve , the speed of the rayleigh wave associated with either deformed half - space .",
    "again , the situation is different from that encountered in linear anisotropic elasticity with silicon / silicon wafers ( mozhaev _ et al . _ , 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , the stoneley wave exists only for stretch ratios greater than 0.321 and the rayleigh wave for stretch ratios greater than 0.451 . in between these two critical stretches",
    ", there is a range were the stoneley wave exists but not the rayleigh wave . at the critical stretch",
    ", instability might occur ; hence is presented an example where two bonded deformed half - spaces exhibit interfacial stability at some compressive stretch ratios for which the separated half - spaces are unstable ( at least in the linearized theory ) .",
