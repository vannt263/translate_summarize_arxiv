    "the main modern achievements in studying processes of double beta decay ( @xmath2-decay ) can be attributed to detection of its two - neutrino mode .",
    "this process has been discovered in as many as ten nuclei ( see reviews @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the data obtained for the two - neutrino mode offer a chance to directly compare different models of the nuclear structure , which form the basis for calculations of nuclear matrix elements @xmath3 , and to select the optimal one . though direct correlation between the values of nuclear matrix elements for the two - neutrino and neutrinoless modes of @xmath4 decay is absent lacking , the methods for calculating @xmath3 and @xmath5 are very close , and a chance possibility to estimate their accuracy in calculating @xmath5 appears only when comparing experimental data and theoretical results calculations for the probability of @xmath6 decay .    it can be expected that acquisition of experimental data on the other types of @xmath7 transitions ( @xmath8 , and @xmath9 processes ) will make it possible to considerably increase the quality of calculations for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays .",
    "much efforts have been currently made in searching for these processes ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) in spite of the fact that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 modes are strongly suppressed relative to @xmath14 decay due to the coulomb barrier for positrons , and a substantially lower kinetic energy attainable in such transitions .",
    "positrons are absent in the final state of the @xmath15 decay , and the kinetic energy of the transition may be rather high ( up to 2.8 mev ) , which dictates determines an increased probability of a decay .",
    "however , this process is also difficult to detect , since it is only characteristic radiation that is detectable in it .",
    "the state - of - the - art experimental limit on the @xmath0kr half - life period with respect to the @xmath15 capture is @xmath16 yr ( 90% c.l . ) @xcite .",
    "the theoretical calculations based on different models predict the following @xmath0kr half - lives for this process : @xmath17 yr @xcite , @xmath18 yr @xcite , and @xmath19 yr @xcite .",
    "the last two values were obtained from the estimates of the @xmath0kr half - life with respect to the total number of @xmath20 captures including in view of the 78.6% fraction of @xmath15 capture events which makes 78.6% @xcite . from comparison of the experimental and theoretical results ,",
    "it is apparent that the sensitivity of measurements has reached the lower limit of theoretical estimates .",
    "the @xmath0kr@xmath21se reaction produces a @xmath0se@xmath22 atom with two vacancies in its @xmath23-shell . the technique for seeking this reaction",
    "is based on the assumption that the values of energies of characteristic photons , and of the probability that they will be emitted when the double vacancy is being filled , coincide with the corresponding values when two separate single vacancies in the @xmath23 shells of two isolated singly ionized se@xmath24 atoms are being filled . in this case , the total measured energy is @xmath25 kev , where @xmath26 is the binding energy of a @xmath23 electron in a se atom ( 12.65 kev ) . the fluorescence yield upon filling of a single vacancy in the @xmath23-shell of se is 0.596 .",
    "the energies and relative intensities of the characteristic lines in the @xmath23 series are @xmath27 kev ( 100% ) , @xmath28 kev ( 52% ) , @xmath29 kev ( 21% ) , and @xmath30 kev ( 1% ) @xcite .",
    "there are three possible ways for deexcitation of a doubly ionized @xmath23-shell : 1 ) emission of auger electrons only ( @xmath31 , @xmath31 ) , 2 ) emission of a single characteristic quantum and an auger electron ( @xmath32 ) , and 3 ) emission of two characteristic quanta and low - energy auger electrons ( @xmath33 ) , with probabilities @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively . a characteristic quantum can travel a long enough distance in a gas medium between the points of its production and absorption .",
    "for example , 10% of characteristic quanta with energies of 11.2 a nd 12.5 kev is absorbed in krypton at a pressure of 4.35 atm ( @xmath37 g/@xmath38 ) on a path 1.83 and 2.42 mm long , respectively ( the values of absorption factors are taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the paths of photoelectrons with the same energies are 0.37 and 0.44 mm , respectively .",
    "they produce almost pointwise charge clusters of primary ionization in the gas . in case of the event with the escape of two characteristic quanta absorbed in the working gas and a single auger electron ,",
    "the energy will be distributed among three pointwise charge clusters .",
    "it is these three - point ( or three - cluster ) events possessing a unique set of features that were the subject of the search in @xcite .    a large proportional counter ( lpc ) with a casing made of m1-grade copper is used to detect the above considered processes .",
    "the lpc has a cylindrical shape with inner and outer diameters of 140 and 150 mm , respectively ; its section along the axis is schematically shown in fig.[lpc ] . a gold - plated tungsten wire of 10 @xmath39 m in diameter goes along the lpc axis and serves as the anode .",
    "the potential of + 2400 is applied to the wire , and the casing ( the cathode ) is grounded .",
    "both ends of the anode are lead to the appropriate end cap flanges via high - voltage pressure - sealed bushings - ceramic insulators with a central electrode taken from spark plugs .    to reduce the influence of edge effects on the operating characteristics of the counter",
    ", the end segments of the wire are passed through the copper tubes with dimensions of @xmath40 mm , which are electrically connected to the anode .",
    "gas amplification is absent on these segments , and charges are collected in an ionization mode . with the fluoroplastic insulator ,",
    "the distance from the working region to the flange is 70 mm .",
    "the working part of the lpc is 595 mm in length ( the distance between the end caps of the tubes ) ; therefore , the lpc s operating volume is 9,159 l. the total capacitance of the counter and the outlet insulator is @xmath41 pf . the total resistance of the anode and two output electrodes is @xmath42 om . all detachable joints are sealed with indium wire .",
    "all nipple joints are sealed with fluoroplastic gaskets .",
    "the internal insulators are made of fluoroplastic .",
    "their thickness was selected so as to be the smallest possible in order to improve the degassing conditions during vacuum treatment of the counter and stabilize its operating characteristics in the course of measurements .",
    "the lpc is filled with a pure kr sample to a total pressure of 4.51 att ; no quenching or accelerating gases are added . prior to filling , kr is purified of electronegative impurities in a ni / sio@xmath43 reactor .",
    "the lps s signals are read out by a charge - sensitive amplifier ( csa ) from one end of the anode wire .",
    "the csa parameters have been selected so that the signal is transmitted with minimum distortions , and information of the spatial distribution of primary - ionization charges in a projection onto a counter radius is fully represented by the pulse shape . when amplified in an auxiliary amplifier ,",
    "the pulses arrive at the input of the digital oscilloscope la - n20 - 12pci , the output data of which ( the pulse waveform digitized with a frequency of 6.25 mhz ) are recorded with a personal computer .",
    "the length of the scanning frame with a resolution of 160 ns is 1024 points ( 163.8 @xmath39s ) , of which @xmath44 @xmath39s is the `` prehistory '' and @xmath45 @xmath39s is the `` history '' .",
    "the counter is calibrated through the wall of its casing by @xmath46 rays of a @xmath47cd source ( @xmath48 kev ; relative yield 0.036 photons / decay ) .",
    "figure [ pic2 ] presents ( _ 0 _ ) the total pulse amplitude spectrum and the energy spectra of ( _ 1 _ ) single- , ( _ 2 _ ) two- , and ( _ 3 _ ) three - point events from the source located in the middle of the lpc length .",
    "the procedure for obtaining them from digitized pulses is described in what follows .",
    "the following factors make their contribution to the low - energy part of the spectrum : characteristic radiation ag@xmath49 ( @xmath50 kev ) from this source , which `` survived '' after passing through a 5-mm - thick copper wall ; scattered radiation from the wall , which is in equilibrium with the characteristic radiation , and compton electrons from scattering of 88-kev photons in the gas with the escape of a compton photon beyond the counter .",
    "the 88-kev peak is wider on the low - energy side due to the contribution of 88-kev @xmath46 rays scattered from the wall .",
    "the energy resolution of this peak , determined by its right half , is 6.5% .",
    "peak _ 4 _ at an energy of 75.4 kev corresponds to the escape of kr characteristic radiation ( @xmath51 kev ) beyond the counter .",
    "the 88-kev full - energy peak contains events with different internal structures .",
    "quanta with this energy are absorbed in kr mostly by photoeffect in the @xmath23-shell ( 86.7% ) .",
    "the photoeffect in other shells makes 13.3% @xcite , @xcite . filling of the vacancy in the @xmath23-shell of kr is accompanied by emission of characteristic radiation in 66.0% of cases and auger electrons in 34.0% @xcite .",
    "the theoretical efficiency of characteristic radiation absorption in the counter s working volume is 86.9% .",
    "therefore , the photoeffect is responsible for 49.7% of two - point events @xmath52 and 42.8% of single - point events @xmath53 out of the total number of absorptions due to photoeffect in the full - energy peak . by single - point events , we mean all events in which only electrons escaping from the shell of a single atom ( photoelectrons @xmath54 auger electrons ) , including events of photoelectric absorption in the upper shells of kr .",
    "only single - point events in an amount of 7.5% @xmath55 $ ] of the total number of photoabsorption events will be presented in peak _",
    "4_.    some primary quanta can be absorbed as a result of two - step process of `` compton scattering - photoeffect '' .",
    "a compton electron creates one ionization point . a compton photon absorbed by photoeffect participates in the above - described processes .",
    "therefore , the two - step process makes its contributions to the full - energy peak in the form of two- and three - point events and to peak _ 4 _ in the form of two - point events . upon normalization to the peak area ,",
    "the estimated final composition of events for the full - energy peak contains 44.1% ( single - point events ) + 51.2% ( two - point events ) due to photoeffect + 2.2% ( two - point events ) + 2.5% ( three - point events ) due to the two - step process . in peak",
    "_ 4 _ , there are 95.3% single - point events + 4.7% two - point events",
    ".    examples of pulses ( dark lines ) corresponding to events of two types are presented in fig.[exam_pulse ] .",
    "the pulse due to photoabsorption of a 88-kev photon with escape of electrons only ( a single - point event ) is shown in fig.[exam_pulse]a , and simultaneous escape of characteristic photon kr with an energy of 12.6 kev and a photoelectron @xmath56  kev - 12.6 kev=75.4 kev ( a two - point event ) is illustrated in fig.[exam_pulse]b . the maximum distance between pointwise charge clusters in projection onto the counter",
    "s radius is equal to the radius . for pure kr , the evaluated time it takes for ionization electrons to drift from the cathode to the anode is 53 @xmath39s . from figs.[exam_pulse]a and [ exam_pulse]b",
    ", it is apparent that the second pulse with a @xmath57 times smaller amplitude is produced in the counter in about @xmath58 @xmath39s after the first one .",
    "this pulse is generated by secondary photoelectrons knocked out of the cathode by photons produced during development of an avalanche from the primary ionization .",
    "the probability of photoeffect on the cathode is rather high , since the working gas contains no quenchers .",
    "the digitized output pulse from the measuring channel can be presented as direct convolution of sought signal @xmath59 with response pulse @xmath60 from the linear system , which is distorted by stochastic or determinate noise @xmath61 : @xmath62    the noise level determines the lower limit on the sensitivity of the measuring channel , while the instrumental function defines the resolution value .",
    "given the values of @xmath63 and @xmath60 , one can try to estimate @xmath64 in the presence of noise @xmath65 ; i.e. , in principle , it is possible to state the inverse problem ( deconvolution ) of determining the signal at the linear system output by the values of the output signal : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the operator inverse .    to determine the values of charges released in individual clusters of a multipoint event , one can differentiate the original charge pulse @xmath68 and represent the obtained shape by a set of gaussian curves . the evaluated area under an individual gaussian curve will correspond to the charge ( energy ) value in the relevant cluster . from figs.[exam_pulse]_c _ and [ exam_pulse]_d _ , it is apparent that direct differentiation provides an asymmetric bell shape ( dark line ) . such shape results from the nearly gaussian distribution of the current pulses due to electrons of primary ionization from a pointwise energy deposit , which arrive at the boundary of the gas amplification region near the anode wire .",
    "this shape is determined by the spatial distribution of the charge density in projection onto the radius .",
    "the parameters of this distribution depend on the time it takes for the primary charge cluster to drift to the anode .",
    "as it drifts , the charge cluster spreads out into a cloud due to electron diffusion .",
    "the pulse read out from the anode wire is mostly produced by a negative charge induced on the anode moving toward the cathode by positive ions produced near the wire in gas amplification process and moving toward the cathode i.e. , the ion component ( i.c . ) .",
    "the estimated total ion drift time is 0.447 s. the contribution of the equilibrium ( with ions ) electron component ( e.c . ) to the total induced charge is @xmath69% .",
    "the electron collection time is @xmath70 ns .",
    "the output pulse shape is defined by the superposition of induced charges from single electron avalanches distributed in time and intensity according to : the shape of the current pulse from primary ionization electrons , the shape of a pulse from an individual avalanche , and a finite time of the csa self - discharge .",
    "the last two parameters are responsible for the asymmetry of the output current pulse .",
    "the output current pulse can be transformed to a symmetric shape by taking into account the analytical dependence of the amplitude of the output voltage pulse generated by a point ( in projection onto the radius at the boundary of the gas amplification region ) group of primary ionization electrons as a function of time and discharge constant of the output storage capacitor @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the amplitude of the voltage pulse from the @xmath73th group of electrons , @xmath74 is the number of primary electrons in the @xmath73th group , @xmath75 is the current time for the dependence of the voltage pulse amplitude from the @xmath73th group , @xmath76 is the time of origin of the total pulse , and @xmath77 is the time of origin of the pulse from the @xmath73th group , @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the gas amplification factor , @xmath80 is the total voltage pulse amplitude produced at output capacitor @xmath81 by a single ion generated in the gas discharge , @xmath82 is the electron charge , @xmath83 is the radius corresponding to the avalanche s center of gravity , @xmath84 is the anode radius , @xmath85 is the cathode radius , _ b _ is the time parameter associated with the motion of positive ions of the gas discharge in a particular gas ( for the lpc filled with kr at 4.51 at , @xmath86 ns ) , @xmath87 is the csa discharge constant , @xmath88 is the leakage resistance , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is the total voltage pulse amplitude produced at output capacitor @xmath81 by a single electron generated in the gas discharge . in eq.(3 ) , the electron component is assumed to appear instantly .    at @xmath91 , eq . ( 3 ) assumes the form @xmath92 in our case , @xmath93 @xmath39s . for a time interval satisfying condition @xmath94 , eq . ( 3 ) can be reduced to the first two expansion terms .",
    "if its is assumed that the gas discharge from @xmath95 of primary electrons happens at the beginning of the digitization interval , the pulse amplitude at the end of this interval can be described by eq .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath96 ns , since the influence of the output capacitor discharge over this time is negligible .",
    "if a contribution of the earlier discharges is absent in this time interval , the pulse amplitude at the upper bound of the interval can be used to determine the @xmath95 value . in this case , it is taken into account that , at the end of a 160-ns interval , the contributions of the terms to the total @xmath72 value in eq .",
    "( 3 ) make 74 and 26% , respectively .",
    "these conditions are satisfied in the recorded actual pulse in the first time channel from the beginning of the pulse .",
    "the @xmath97 value obtained from the actual pulse is used in eq .",
    "( 3 ) to calculate the total shape of the partial pulse in the entire time interval from the beginning to the end of the frame .",
    "the pulse obtained thereby is subtracted from the actual one .",
    "therefore , the above condition is now fulfilled for the first digitization interval of the residual pulse or for the second interval of the original pulse .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the last time channel in the frame .",
    "the sequence of @xmath95 values for a single - point event has a symmetrical distribution with a nearly gaussian shape .",
    "it is this distribution that is used for further analysis .",
    "the area under the gaussian curve or , in the case of a multiparticle event , the sum of the gaussian areas on a time interval of 53 @xmath39s from the beginning of the pulse yields the total number of primary ionization electrons . to plot the spectra in fig.2 ,",
    "this sum is multiplied by the coefficient equal to the averaged ratio of areas of the actual current pulse and of the calculated gaussian curve for purely single - point events .",
    "the calculated , area - normalized current pulses of primary ionization electrons at the boundary of the gas amplification region are shown with light curves in figs.[exam_pulse]_c _ and [ exam_pulse]_d _ , and the corresponding voltage ( charge ) pulses obtained by integrating these current pulses are depicted with light lines in figs [ exam_pulse]_a _ and [ exam_pulse]_b_.    from figs.[exam_pulse]_c _ and [ exam_pulse]_d _ , it is apparent that , at an energy deposit of 88 kev , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is rather high . in the energy range of @xmath98 kev , in which the @xmath99-capture in @xmath0kr is sought , the snr for individual components of the total energy deposit corresponding to the possible effect ( 25.3 kev ) is not so favorable .",
    "figures [ pic4]_a _ and [ pic4]_b _ present examples of recalculated current pulses for two types of two - point energy deposits due to the @xmath23-capture of @xmath100kr isotope . the total energy deposit corresponds to the binding energy of an electron in the @xmath23-shell of a daughter @xmath100br ( 13.5 kev ) .",
    "the energies of a characteristic quantum ( @xmath101 kev ) and concomitant auger electrons ( @xmath102 kev ) are close to the energies of individual components for events of the @xmath99-capture of @xmath0kr .",
    "more detailed information on the @xmath100kr source is given in what follows .    from fig.[pic4 ] , it is apparent that these signals have a high noise level .",
    "noises and possible electric pickup may both mask the low - energy component and create a false one .",
    "the use of traditional methods of frequency filtering with different window functions , e.g. , in the form of the hamming @xcite , wiener @xcite , and savitzky - golay @xcite filters , sometimes fail to ensure reliable extraction of closely spaced ( fig .",
    "4a ) and masking each other components of a compound event .",
    "mathematical studies carried out in late 1980s initiated intense development of a principally new class of orthogonal transforms based on the use of wavelet functions @xcite .",
    "wavelet transforms are distinguished by a high degree of locality of their base functions both in the time and frequency regions , which allows one to use them for processing of many nonstationary processes .",
    "`` in the preliminary processing of our lpc data it is expedient to use multiresolutional signal analysis @xcite based on the _ dyadic transform of discrete signals _ , and often called discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) . in this case , the analyzed signal @xmath103 is presented as the decomposition @xmath104 where are the well - known orthonormal scaling ( scaling functions ) and wavelet functions- ' ' ancestor \" wavelets ; @xmath105 are the empirical approximation coefficients and @xmath106 are the empirical detailing coefficients ; @xmath107 are the current values of the scale and the shift ; @xmath108 is the number of approximation ( detailing ) coefficients considered at the relevant levels of the decomposition ; @xmath109 is the initial scale value ; and @xmath110 is the final scale value .      scaling functions @xmath114 and mother wavelet functions @xmath115 , which have @xmath99 nonzero coefficients ,",
    "satisfy the so - called two - level relations @xcite : @xmath116 @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the coefficients of low- and high - frequency filters of the wavelet transform , when @xmath120 .",
    "as distinct from other types of transforms , in which the base functions are explicitly specified , one succeeds in analytically obtaining the base functions in the wavelet analysis only in rare cases , and the basis is most frequently specified by coefficients @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in this paper",
    ", we use wavelets of the daubechies family .",
    "the scaling functions and the daubechies wavelets are continuous functions that are not identically equal to zero on a finite segment and are not differentiable anywhere on this segment .",
    "table [ tab1 ] contains the filter coefficients used in the daubechies scaling functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( numbers 4 and 6 denote the number of nonzero coefficients in the filters ) .",
    "they are rational numbers and fully define the daubechies wavelet transform ( dvt ) @xcite .",
