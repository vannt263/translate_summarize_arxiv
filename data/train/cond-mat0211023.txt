    "quantum dots , or _ artificial atoms _ , have been a subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies in recent years @xcite due to the occurrence of numerous interesting effects caused by electron correlation , such as e.  g.  wigner crystallization , overcharging , and nontrivial behavior in a magnetic field .",
    "these electron correlations appear most clearly when the electron interaction and the confinement potential dominates over the kinetic energy of the system .",
    "this can be realized in e.g.  quantum dots which have much smaller electron density as compared to real atoms .",
    "correlation effects show up in an even more pronounced way in classical systems where the kinetic energy is zero in the absence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "two - dimensional ( @xmath6 ) classical dots confined by a parabolic potential were studied earlier and a table of mendeleyev for such `` artificial '' atoms was constructed @xcite .",
    "the classical system which is more closely related to real atoms was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where , as function of the strength of the confinement potential , surprising rich physics was observed like structural transitions , spontaneous symmetry breaking , and unbinding of particles , which is absent in parabolic confined dots .",
    "the confinement potential was of the coulomb type , but in order to prevent the collapse of all electrons onto the `` nucleus '' ( which we call impurity in this case ) the positive charge ( @xmath2 ) was displaced a certain distance from the @xmath6 plane where the electrons are moving in ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figmodel ] ) .",
    "note that our system is related to the `` superatom '' system introduced by watanabe and inoshita @xcite .",
    "the superatom is a spherical modulation - doped heterojunction . in particular",
    "it is a quasi - atomic system which consists of a spherical donor - doped core and a surrounding impurity - free matrix with a larger electron affinity .",
    "the quantum mechanical electron structure of this system was studied in @xcite and it was found that due to the absence of the @xmath7 singularity in the potential the ordering of the energy levels is dominated by the no - radial - node states , in contrast to real atoms where @xmath8 and @xmath9 states are dominant .    in the present paper",
    "we present a systematic study of the system of ref .",
    "@xcite as a function of the number of particles ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "in contrast to ref . @xcite we will not vary the strength of the confinement potential , as this was already presented in our earlier work @xcite where we limited the numerical results to the case @xmath10 , but we will vary z and n. furthermore , we will compare our numerical results with the results of a hydrodynamic , i.e. continuum , approach . in the latter case",
    "the electron density is taken as a fluid , i.e. there are no charge quanta .",
    "this is in contrast to our numerical simulation where the electrons are point particles with a fixed quantized charge value .",
    "the fact that charge is now distributed in packages of @xmath11 will introduce important correlation effects which is the central theme of the present work",
    ".    note also that the present classical study can serve as a zeroth order approach for more demanding quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "recently , such classical calculations were used @xcite as a starting point in order to construct better quantum wavefunctions , at least in the strong magnetic field limit .",
    "besides the above mentioned analogy with real and artificial atoms which are inherently quantum mechanical there exist other experimental realized systems which behave purely classical and for which our study is relevant .",
    "examples are charged colloidal suspensions where it was found recently that correlation effects between the counter - ions can result into an overscreening and attraction between like charged colloids @xcite . our system is a simplified 2d model for those colloidal systems .    the system under study can be realized experimentally in the system of electrons above liquid helium @xcite by putting a positive localized charge in the substrate which supports the liquid helium .",
    "the equivalent quantum mechanical system can be realized using low dimensional semiconductor structures with impurities , also called remote impurities , which are displaced a distance from a quantum well @xcite . in both cases",
    "it will be rather difficult to increase the number of positive charge @xmath3 beyond a few units .",
    "another possible realization of our system is by bringing an @xmath12 ( atomic force microscope ) tip close to a @xmath6 electron gas .",
    "when this tip is charged positively it will induce a confinement potential very similar to the one studied in the present paper .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the charge @xmath2 on the tip can be varied continuously by increasing the voltage on the tip .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the mathematical model and our numerical approach to obtain the configurations .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations are given in section iii . a hydrodynamic approach which neglects the correlation effects",
    "is presented in sections iv .",
    "the numerical simulation results are compared with the results of the hydrodynamic approximation in section v which clearly brings about the importance of the charge correlation .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "we study a system with @xmath0 negatively charged particles ( @xmath1 ) , which we call here and further electrons , interacting through a repulsive coulomb potential and moving in the @xmath13-plane .",
    "the particles are kept together through a fixed positive charge ( @xmath2 ) located at a distance @xmath14 from the plane the particles are moving in ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figmodel ] ) .",
    "the total energy of this system is given by the hamiltonian @xmath15 here the symbol @xmath16 stands for the dielectric constant , and @xmath17 is the two component position vector of the 2d ( two dimensional ) electron . for convenience ,",
    "we express the electron energy in units of @xmath18 and all the distances in units of @xmath14 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the following dimensionless form : @xmath19    the ground state configurations of the two - dimensional system were obtained using the standard metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "the electrons are initially put in random positions within some circle and allowed to reach a steady state configuration after a number of simulation steps in the order of @xmath20 . to check",
    "if the obtained configuration is stable , we calculated the frequencies of the normal modes of the system using the householder diagonalization technique @xcite .",
    "the configuration was taken as final when all frequencies of the normal modes are positive and the energy did not decrease further .",
    "the meta - stable states were avoided introducing a small temperature @xmath21 , which was negligible and does not influence the simulation accuracy .",
    "as an example of our results we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] the radial distribution of the electrons for a fixed positive charge @xmath22 for the impurity as function of the numbers of electrons @xmath0 in the dot .",
    "clearly , two different electron distribution types can be distinguished .",
    "namely , for small number of electrons @xmath0 a ring structure arrangement for the electrons is observed which is similar to the one for a parabolic dot ( compare with the configurations given in @xcite ) , for large @xmath0 the outer electrons can form a ring which is clearly separated from the other electrons in the dot .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] where examples of two different configurations ( for small and large @xmath0 ) are presented .     for a fixed coulomb center with @xmath22 . ]",
    "note that in the case of large @xmath0 the core electrons are arranged in nearly a triangular lattice which is characteristic for an infinite electron system .",
    "the very different type of configurations for small @xmath0 and large @xmath0 is a consequence of the fact that the screening of the coulomb center is a much more complicated problem as compared with the parabolic dot case .",
    "now its behavior is controlled by two parameters , namely , the number of electrons @xmath0 , which characterizes the discreteness of the charges taking participation in the screening , and the positive charge @xmath3 , which represents the strength of the confinement coulomb potential .    in the case of a relatively small number of electrons ( @xmath23 )",
    "the confinement potential is strong , and the electrons are located close to the origin where the confinement potential can be replaced by the following approximate one : @xmath24 now substituting it into hamiltonian ( [ reducedhamilt ] ) , and scaling the variables @xmath25 one obtains the hamiltonian @xmath26 which , up to a non - essential energy shift , coincides with the hamiltonian of a parabolic dot as considered in reference @xcite . in the above @xmath22 case",
    "we have the same parabolic dot like configurations up to @xmath27 , while for @xmath28 new configurations as ( 3,7 ) , ( 4,7 ) and so on appear . for larger @xmath3",
    "the similarity between parabolic dot and coulomb center screening persists up to larger @xmath0 values .",
    "the equivalence of coulomb screening and the results for a parabolic dot at small @xmath0 values is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , where the energy per particle and the maximum radius of a coulomb dot confined by a positive impurity charge @xmath29 are shown as a function of @xmath0 and compared with the results obtained for the parabolic dot @xcite .",

    "more over , if one plots the differences of energy per particle ( scaled by @xmath3 ) as a function of the number of particles @xmath0 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we can see small cusps related to the so called `` magic numbers '' which are known to be an important feature of the configurations of the parabolic dots @xcite .     as a function of @xmath0 for a coulomb dot with @xmath32 .",
    "examples of configurations where kinks are found in the energy curve are shown in the insets . ]    in the opposite case of large electron numbers ( @xmath33 ) , where the system is nearly neutral , one can expect to find features which are specific for our coulomb screening case and which are not found with a parabolic dot .",
    "in this asymptotic case , the coulomb dot presents a low density system @xcite which is under the influence of a nonhomogeneous electric field .",
    "we already know that correlation effects in such a system is of most importance .",
    "that is why it is worth to take as a reference the hydrodynamic approach , which is some mean field theory where no correlation effects are included .",
    "in the hydrodynamic approach the electrons are described by the 2d density @xmath34 .",
    "they create a potential @xmath35 which obey the poisson equation @xmath36 in the whole 3d space . using the dimensionless variables introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the electron density is measured in @xmath37 units and the potential in @xmath38 units .",
    "note we took into account the cylinder symmetry of the problem caused by the confining potential @xmath39 ( see eq .",
    "( [ reducedhamilt ] ) ) .",
    "the poisson equation can be replaced by the laplace equation @xmath40 everywhere outside the @xmath13-plane together with the boundary condition @xmath41 on this plane .",
    "the mathematical model is based on the statement that the electrons ( located in the circular disk of radius @xmath42 ) have the same energy in every point of the dot , namely , @xmath43 here the symbol @xmath44 stands for the potential created by the 2d electrons in the disk , and the symbol @xmath45 is the chemical potential of this electron system .",
    "the above equations have to be supplemented with one more expression , namely , the conservation of the total number of electrons @xmath46 the hydrodynamic approach is a kind of mean field theory where no correlation effects are included . for instance , the phenomena of overcharging @xcite can not take place , and the condition @xmath47 is always satisfied , namely , the number of electrons @xmath0 attracted by the coulomb center never exceeds its charge number @xmath3 .",
    "the specific case @xmath48 is referred to as _",
    "complete screening_. in this case the analytical solution of the above equations can be obtained using the mirror charge technique , and it leads to the following result @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this simple limiting case result is useful as a reference .    in the general @xmath52 case we solved the hydrodynamic equations using the oblate spherical coordinates ( @xmath53 ) which are defined by    [ oblatesph ] @xmath54    as it was done in refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of a parabolic dot with radius @xmath42 .",
    "the solution of the laplace equation ( [ laplace ] ) can be presented as an expansion @xmath55 in terms of the first @xmath56 and second @xmath57 kind legendre polynomials .",
    "thus , the potential created by the electrons on the disk ( @xmath58 ) can be presented as @xmath59 now taking into account that on the disk we have according to eq .",
    "( [ oblatesph3 ] ) @xmath60 and satisfying the boundary condition ( [ poissonbc ] ) one gets the analogous expansion for the electron density @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the gamma function .",
    "next , we expand the coulomb center potential on the disk into a series of legendre polynomials as well @xmath64 and inserting it together with eq .",
    "( [ potdisk ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) we obtain the final expression @xmath65 for the electron density expansion coefficients @xmath66 .    in order to define the chemical potential @xmath45 we have to remember that the electron density has to be equal to zero at the free electron system boundary @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the electron density should satisfy the following condition @xmath68 what finally enables us to define the chemical potential @xmath69 and write down the following electron density expression @xmath70 inserting the density expression ( [ elden ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ number ] ) one obtains the number of electrons @xmath71 taking part in the screening of the coulomb center .    equations ( [ expcc ] ) , ( [ chempot ] ) , ( [ eldensfin ] ) , and ( [ nfin ] ) actually are the solution of the problem if the coefficients @xmath72 are known . these coefficients are calculated in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "the density ( [ eldensfin ] ) enables us to calculate all properties of the electron system .",
    "for instance , the square of mean electron radius can be estimated as @xmath73 due to the linear dependence of the confinement potential ( [ expcc ] ) , the chemical potential ( [ chempot ] ) and the density ( [ eldensfin ] ) on the charge number @xmath3 , it can be removed by a scaling , and the hydrodynamic problem is actually controlled by a single parameter ( say , @xmath74 or @xmath42 ) in contrast to the system of discrete electrons for which the two parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath0 ) were essential .",
    "thus , the general solution can be presented by both chemical potential and density curves , as is shown in fig .",

    "we see that in the case of small radius ( or equivalently large @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath77 ) the electron density becomes similar to the density in a parabolic dot ( @xmath78 ) , while in the opposite large radius case it tends to the limiting density ( [ fullscreen ] ) for the completely screened case .",
    "in order to compare the numerical simulation results with the hydrodynamic approach we scaled them by the charge number @xmath3 . in fig .  [ fig : fig8](a ) , the energy per particle scaled by @xmath3 is shown as a function of the relative number of electrons @xmath79 .",

    "the numerical simulation results were calculated as the difference of the total energies for adjacent configurations , namely , @xmath81 . we see that when the charge number @xmath3 increases the curves tend towards the hydrodynamic result .",
    "this is more clearly seen for the chemical potential ( fig .",
