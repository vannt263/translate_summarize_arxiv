    "the _ xy _ gauge glass model  @xcite has attracted much interest in connection to the vortex glass phase of high-@xmath4 superconductors  @xcite . in three dimensions ( 3d )",
    "there is a general consensus that the _ xy _ gauge glass model exhibits a finite - temperature glass transition  @xcite .",
    "however , in 2d there exist conflicting evidences : on the one hand , equilibrium studies of defect energy  @xcite , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the root - mean - square current  @xcite , and resistance calculation  @xcite have suggested that no finite-@xmath2 ordering exists .",
    "the glass order parameter has furthermore been analytically shown to vanish at any finite @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the mc studies of the glass susceptibility  @xcite , as well as dynamical simulations of the resistance  @xcite and non - equilibrium relaxation  @xcite , have indicated a possibility of a finite-@xmath2 transition .",
    "also the mc simulations of the helicity modulus in ref .",
    "@xcite were interpreted as being compatible with a finite-@xmath2 transition .    in this paper",
    "we study a generalization of the 2d _ xy _ gauge glass model  the random gauge _",
    "model  where both the temperature @xmath2 and disorder strength @xmath3 can be varied .",
    "when @xmath3 has the maximum value 1 , it corresponds to the usual _ xy _ gauge glass model , while in the opposite limit of @xmath5 , the standard _",
    "xy _ model without disorder is recovered  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that there is a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) like transition at a finite temperature @xmath4 when the disorder strength is sufficiently small , and that as @xmath3 is increased @xmath4 becomes smaller until it vanishes as @xmath3 reaches the critical disorder strength @xmath6",
    "( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 for @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "however , even if the glass order parameter is zero and even if there is no finite-@xmath2 kt transition for @xmath10 , the existence of a finite-@xmath2 transition with a different character can not _ a priori _ be ruled out .    in the present paper",
    "we perform extensive mc simulations to study the phase transition of the random gauge @xmath11 model .",
    "it is found that the system is superconducting at any @xmath3 and that the transition from normal to superconducting phase is consistent with a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type at weak disorder and a non - kt type at strong disorder .",
    "in addition to this we suggest that there exist two different superconducting phases at sufficiently low temperatures separated by a non - kt phase transition ( see fig .",
    "[ phd ] ) .",
    "for the special case of @xmath12 , which corresponds to the 2d _ xy _ gauge glass model , we also compute the root - mean - square current in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite and , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , again consistently find a finite - temperature transition .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 2d random gauge _",

    "the phase angle @xmath19 at the lattice point @xmath20 satisfies the periodicity @xmath21 , and @xmath22 $ ] is a uniform quenched random variable with the disorder strength @xmath23 .",
    "the twist variable @xmath24 corresponds to the global twist across the system , i.e. , the summation of the gauge invariant phase difference @xmath25 along the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) direction equals @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . for a given disorder realization",
    ", we first compute the distribution @xmath30 , which is related to the free energy @xmath31 by @xmath32 . the twist variable @xmath33 which minimizes @xmath31 ( or maximizes @xmath34 )",
    "is determined from @xmath34 and then fixed when the helicity modulus @xmath35 and the 4th order modulus @xmath36 are computed .    to ensure that the cooling is slow enough , we simultaneously cool two replicas ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) of the system and measure @xmath39 . for the first cooling at a new temperature we use 120000 update sweeps ( for spin and twist variables respectively ) .",
    "then we check that @xmath40 sets the precision of the cooling .",
    "the idea with the annealing condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : annealing ] ) is to keep the system close to the lowest - energy state at a particular temperature ( so the system does not freeze into a local minimum that bias @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] ) .",
    "since the system moves more swiftly over the configuration space the higher the temperature is we can choose @xmath43 increasing with temperature .",
    "a choice that proves good in practice is @xmath44 if the annealing condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : annealing ] ) fail we repeat the cooling with three times as many update sweeps ; if it fails again we increase the number of cooling sweeps a factor three again , and so on until the condition is fulfilled .",
    "when @xmath33 is chosen , before cooling , we let the system run until eq .",
    "( [ eq : annealing ] ) is fulfilled with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "we repeat the above calculations for more than 500 different disorder realizations ( the disorder average is denoted by @xmath46 $ ] throughout this paper ) .",
    "= 8.2truecm    = 8.2truecm    for the case of @xmath12 , we also use the periodic boundary condition pbc , corresponding to @xmath47 in eq .",

    ", we use 50000 update sweeps for thermalizations and 500000 sweeps for measurements where the actual measurement was performed every tenth sweep .",
    "we used this computer time saving strategy since we found that performing the measurement every sweep gave closely the same result .",
    "= 8.2truecm    = 8.2truecm",
    "we first investigate the standard 2d _ xy _ gauge glass model , corresponding to the fully disordered case ( @xmath12 ) , and show in fig .",
    "[ yl](a ) the helicity modulus @xmath41 $ ] as a function of the system size @xmath50 for various temperatures .",
    "it is clearly shown that at high @xmath2 , @xmath41 $ ] goes to zero as the system size @xmath50 is increased .",
    "the crucial point is that , at low enough temperatures ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath41 $ ] changes its curvature in terms of @xmath50 , and appears to saturate to a finite value as @xmath50 is increased .",
    "this behavior suggests a phase transition with a scale - invariant power law dependence at the critical temperature and a diverging characteristic length .",
    "such a behavior can often be described by the finite - size scaling form @xmath52 = l^{-b } f\\bigl ( l^{1/\\nu } ( t - t_c ) \\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath41 \\sim l^{-b}$ ] at the critical temperature @xmath4 , and the critical exponent @xmath53 is related to the divergence of the coherence length . at @xmath4 , the scaling function @xmath54 has the same value irrespective of @xmath50 , implying that @xmath55 $ ] versus @xmath2 should have a unique crossing point at @xmath4 for various sizes . in fig .",
    "[ yl](b ) , it is clearly shown that @xmath41 $ ] has a scale - invariant behavior @xmath41\\propto l^{-0.4}$ ] at a unique @xmath2 , signaling a phase transition .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ yl](b ) furthermore confirms that this scaling behavior is consistent with the standard form  ( [ eq : fss ] ) with @xmath56 .",
    "simple dimensional analysis for the non - disordered case , @xmath5 , gives for @xmath41 $ ] the exponent @xmath57 and from such a dimensional analysis one would likewise conclude that @xmath57 also for the disordered case .",
    "thus if @xmath41 $ ] scales with @xmath58 for the disordered case this is equivalent to the appearance of an anomalous dimension not accounted for by simple dimensional analysis .",
    "our suggestion , based on the simulation results , is consequently that the disorder introduces such an anomalous dimension .",
    "figure  [ fig : irms ] shows the root - mean - square current  ( [ eq : irms ] ) for the pbc .",
    "we first note in fig .",
    "[ fig : irms](a ) that the finite - size - scaling form for @xmath59 used in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath60 with @xmath61 , shows systematic deviations from the data collapse to a single scaling curve at lower temperatures , in contrast to what was concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite , when more and better converged data are included .",
    "furthermore a @xmath62-collapse can not be achieved with any value of @xmath53 . on the other hand",
    "if we , in analogy with the finding for @xmath41 $ ] above , use the scaling form @xmath63 which allows for the same anomalous dimension , one obtains the scaling plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : irms](b ) with @xmath64 and @xmath65.@xcite from figs",
    ".  [ yl ] and [ fig : irms ] we conclude that the 2d @xmath11 gauge glass ( @xmath12 ) exhibits a non - kt type superconducting to normal transition at @xmath65 characterized by the existence of the anomalous dimension @xmath64 and @xmath66 .",
    "next we investigate the phase transition with decreasing @xmath3 . for @xmath67",
    ", we obtain the finite - size scaling plots of the same quality as in fig .",
    "[ yl](b ) , and determine the phase boundary ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ phd ] ) .",
    "as @xmath3 is changed from @xmath68 to @xmath69 the exponents @xmath70 and @xmath53 exhibit quite rapid changes , @xmath70 from 0.27 to 0.06 and @xmath53 from 1.1 to 2.0 .",
    "this , in our interpretation , reflects that near @xmath71 the nature of the superconducting - normal transition changes from a non - kt type to a kt type .",
    "= 8.2truecm    = 8.2truecm    for @xmath5 the phase transition is of the kt nature and it has been suggested that this character should persist along the phase boundary up to some @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "the kt transition is characterized by that @xmath41 $ ] jumps from a finite value @xmath41=2t/\\pi$ ] to zero as the phase line is crossed from the small ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) region .",
    "for @xmath5 we find that the kt transition is also characterized by the increase of the 4th order modulus @xmath73|\\propto l^c$ ] at @xmath4 with a positive exponent @xmath74 , and @xmath42 $ ] stays at a constant value below @xmath4 as @xmath50 is increased  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ yy ]  ( a ) shows @xmath42 $ ] for @xmath75 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "the kt condition in the inset gives @xmath76 .",
    "this means that if the transition is of kt type then it would occur around @xmath76 .",
    "the onset of size dependence for @xmath42 $ ] in fig .",
    "[ yy ]  ( a ) is consistent with a transition at around @xmath77 .",
    "thus the transition is compatible with a kt - character , although a different character can not be ruled out .",
    "the situation for @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ yy ]  ( b ) is quite different : the inset shows that the kt jump condition is not fulfilled and a kt transition can be ruled out .",
    "yet there is a marked structure in @xmath41 $ ] around @xmath79 .",
    "this structure corresponds to the onset of strong size dependence in @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "we interpret this onset as the reflection of a true divergence in @xmath42 $ ] consistent with a phase transition .",
    "thus we suggest that the whole boundary to the low-@xmath2 kt phase ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ phd ] ) is reflected in a divergence of @xmath42 $ ] and that this line ends at ( @xmath80,@xmath81 ) .",
    "a phase line which ends at ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) has been found in many earlier investigations ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein)@xcite .",
    "the difference with earlier work is that in our case such a phase line is for lower temperatures between the two different superconducting phases si and sii ( as demonstrated by our direct calculation of @xmath41 $ ] ) , whereas earlier work have concluded that such a phases line does indeed exist but separates a superconducting phase from a normal phase all the way down to @xmath80 .",
    "our suggested phase diagram is thus consistent with earlier work as to the existence of a phase line ending at ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) . for temperatures larger than the merging with the second phase line ( above dashed line in fig .",
    "[ phd ] ) the transition is consistent with a kt transition although a different character can not be ruled out .",
    "however , below the merging with this second line the transition is not a kt transition .",
    "it may be that there still is a jump in @xmath41 $ ] at this transition , but this is then between two non - vanishing values .",
    "based on the numerical evidences we suggest the structure of the phase diagram is sketched in fig .",
    "one striking feature is the finite-@xmath2 transition line between normal and superconducting phases , starting from the boundary of the low-@xmath2 kt - phase ( solid line ) and changing into the ( dashed ) line which ends at @xmath65 at @xmath12 .",
    "the latter line ( dashed line ) is characterized by the appearance of an anomalous dimension @xmath70 .",
    "since the kt transition does not have such an anomalous dimension it follows that , if the transition along the boundary to the low-@xmath2 kt phase boundary has kt character , then @xmath70 should approach @xmath57 when the two transition line merge . thus the rapid drop from @xmath82 to @xmath83 as @xmath3",
    "is changed from @xmath84 to 0.4 is consistent with a change over to a kt transition .",
    "another interesting feature is that the phase line ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ phd ] ) , associated with the divergence of @xmath42 $ ] , continues even inside the superconducting region and ends at @xmath85 for @xmath80 .",
    "although the transition separating the kt phase and the normal phase ( si and n , respectively , in fig .  [ phd ] ) , may well be of the true kt type , manifested by a universal jump in the helicity modulus , the phase line separating si and sii in fig .",
    "[ phd ] is not a kt transition and the helicity modulus has a non - zero value on both sides .",
    "it is interesting to note that earlier works have found evidences for only two phases separated by a _",
    "single _ phase line ; either , in the more prevailing view , a phase line ending at a point @xmath80 for a finite @xmath72 , or , in the less prevailing view , a phase line ending at a point @xmath86 for @xmath12 . > from our numerical simulations we instead suggest three distinct phases separated by @xmath87 phase lines , which combines the two earlier proposed scenarios and provides a unified picture : on the one hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the end point of the phase boundary to the low-@xmath2 kt - phase has been obtained to be @xmath88 and @xmath80 , which is consistent with our cruder estimate @xmath76 . on the other hand , the phase transition point at @xmath89 with @xmath90 , found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for @xmath12 , is in very good agreement with the end point of our finite-@xmath2 phase line ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "however , the difference with the previous work  @xcite is that according to our interpretation the phase line below @xmath93 ending at @xmath80 and @xmath81 separates two distinct superconducting phases , while the whole phase line in ref .",
    "@xcite is for the superconducting to normal transition . a very hand - waving picture of the scenario of our phase diagram in terms of vortex motion",
    "is sketched in fig .",
    "[ phd ] : in si the vortex motion is suppressed by vortex pair binding , in n pair unbinding has occurred and free vortices exists which are not entirely pinned by the disorder , whereas in sii vortex pair unbinding has occurred but the vortices are pinned by the disorder .",
    "one main conclusion from this phase diagram is that the _ xy _ gauge glass model ( @xmath12 ) has a finite-@xmath2 transition .",
    "how is this possible in view of earlier conflicting evidences ? in ref .",
    "@xcite it was concluded , on the basis of an analysis of data for the root - mean - square current for standard periodic boundary conditions  @xcite , that no finite-@xmath2 transition exists in 2d .",
    "we have found that , taking into account the possibility of an anomalous scaling dimension , @xmath49 displays a transition at a finite - temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : irms ] )  @xcite",
    ". another puzzling evidence to the contrary is the @xmath80 calculations of the size scaling of the defect energy  @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the local vorticity conservation must be properly taken into account when calculating the energy barriers .",
    "thus the energy barrier for vortex dissipation increases with system size when taking the local vorticity conservation into account@xcite .",
    "this growing of the energy barrier for vortex dissipation with system size supports the possibility of a finite-@xmath2 transition  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a new superconducting phase for the _ xy _ random gauge model is intriguing .",
    "in particular , since it is neither a low @xmath2 kt phase nor a phase with a finite glass order parameter .",
    "the true nature of this phase and the existence of similar phases in other related models are open questions .",
